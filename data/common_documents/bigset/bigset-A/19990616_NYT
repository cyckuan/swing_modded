<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ For three days, it stood on its pedestal behind
velvet ropes at Buffalo's Walden Galleria.
</P>
<P>
   But as Game 4 began Tuesday night, it was time to pack up the
Stanley Cup for its next adventure.
</P>
<P>
   At the worldly age of 106, the Cup has traveled to both the
Kremlin and the White House. Sylvain Lefebvre of Colorado baptized
his daughter in it during the summer of 1996. The Red Wings' Joey
Kocur used it to hold a serving of his grandfather's special-recipe
popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   For those who pursue hockey as a living, there is no more
memorable journey than that one lap of the ice that a winning
player takes while holding the just-won Stanley Cup high over his
head. It is hockey's version of cutting down the net, of donning
the green jacket or of dousing Tim McCarver with pennant champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Only, in hockey, there is so much more to it than that.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey is awash with superstitions and bows to protocol. And
Tuesday night, one of the most dramatic of those hockey bows was
poised to take place.
</P>
<P>
   A Game 4 victory by the Stars would have meant that the Cup
would have been packed and primped for a flight today to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Two chaperones, Craig Campbell and Phil Pritchard from the
Hockey Hall of Fame, had been assigned to take custody of the Cup
upon its arrival in Dallas. Protocol dictates that it would have
remained packed in its protective case and then hidden from sight,
somewhere deep in the bowels of Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   If the Stars had won Game 4 and were leading in Game 5 as the
contest reached its 55th minute, Campbell and Pritchard were to
unpack Lord Stanley's famous prize and carry it onto the ice for
the joyous presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, it wasn't meant to be. Packed and ready, with the series
now knotted 2-2, the Cup instead will be returned today to the
Hockey Hall of Fame in downtown Toronto, where it will sit and wait
for its new itinerary. WHO YA GONNA CALL?
</P>
<P>
   Because, we can only assume, downtown Buffalo is such a wild and
wacky party town, the Stars cloistered themselves for Games 3 and 4
at something called the Grand Island Holiday Inn.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Island is exactly that _ an island, surrounded by a river,
visited occasionally by seagulls and by Presidents' Trophy-winning
hockey clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line was, the Stars spent their five days closer to
Canada than they did to downtown Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   They were not the five-star accommodations that professional
hockey teams are accustomed to. No big deal, the players said. But
after a couple of days, the Stars began hearing ... stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the place is haunted,'' broadcaster Daryl Reaugh said.
</P>
<P>
   As the story goes, related Tuesday by a bellman who used to work
at the hotel, the town supervisor once lived on the property and
his home was destroyed by a great fire. His daughter died in the
blaze.
</P>
<P>
   The Holiday Inn was erected on the same site, but the daughter's
spirit has refused to leave. She haunts the grounds, reportedly
rattling doors and making occasional odd noises. Managers have
quit, convinced that the legend is true, the former bellman said.
</P>
<P>
   On a somewhat related note, no Stars players disappeared through
the TV set during the five-day stay. THE ROAD WARRIORS
</P>
<P>
   To the Stars, the road is anything but a foreboding place.
</P>
<P>
   They fear neither the long flight, nor the enemy crowd, nor the
$12 room-service hamburger.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into Tuesday night's game, the Stars had won six times
in opposing teams' arenas during the playoffs. They clinched their
opening-round series in Edmonton in triple overtime. They won their
conference semifinal series in overtime in St. Louis. They forced a
deciding seventh game against Colorado by storming past the
Avalanche in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   So, how do you explain that?
</P>
<P>
   ``We drink a lot more on the road,'' defenseman Craig Ludwig
deadpanned.
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig was kidding. Anyone who follows the game knows that the
days of the hard-drinking, hard-skating, hell-raising hockey player
are past.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't afford to do that anymore,'' said Dave Reid, a
16-year NHL veteran. ``With the travel we have and the competition
now, you'd only be jeopardizing your career.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars survive the road because, they are convinced, their
game travels well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our style of play is very consistent,'' Reid explained.
``We're very controlled in what we do, whether we're at home or on
the road. And with the experience we have, guys know how to play in
different arenas and in front of different crowds, and they don't
let it distract them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig said he agrees with that and, in truth, some of the
Stars' most out-of-character performances this season have come at
home. Game 5 of the Colorado series, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get home, we hear the crowd, and, I don't know, we try to
put on a good show or something,'' the 17-year veteran said.
</P>
<P>
   Having a core of mature, experienced veterans helps, though,
when a team finds itself standing on strange ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have guys on this team that have been to all the hostile
places on the road,'' Ludwig said. ``You think some buildings are
bad now. You should have seen them 15 years ago. People throwing
towels on the ice and stuff. We just kind of turn the cheers off.''
</P>
<P>
   Having so many thirtysomething players, 35-year-old winger Pat
Verbeek said, can be ``a calming influence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It also helps when we're playing like (something smelly),''
Verbeek went on. ``We kick our own butts.''
</P>
<P>
   As a vital Game 4 of the Stanley finals neared, the Stars'
locker room at Marine Midland Arena seemed serene and confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the benefit of having so many older players,'' Ludwig
said. ``They've all been through that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like this game here. Even though we're probably going to have
to weather the first five or six minutes, we'll settle down, and
for us it'll be just another night.''
</P>
<P>
   Just another night. Sure. nn

LAKERS PIN FUTURE ON JACKSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ To restore their former glory as rulers of the West,
the Lakers are reaching East, and even to the Far East, to snare
the best available mind in NBA coaching.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson, armed with eight championship rings and several
volumes of Eastern philosophy, will bring his winning touch and Zen
approach to the Lakers when he is named head coach today.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson agreed Tuesday to a five-year contract believed to be
worth $30 million to $35 million. The deal was hammered out
long-distance from Jackson's home in Montana, and he is set to sign
it this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reached an agreement in principle with him,'' Lakers
spokesman John Black confirmed Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers executive Jerry West and general manager Mitch Kupchak
did not return phone calls. Jackson's agent, Todd Musberger, also
was unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   But this imminent partnership doesn't need much description. The
deal speaks for itself.
</P>
<P>
   In one transaction, the Lakers have taken one of the league's
best young lineups and hitched it to one of the NBA's all-time
winningest coaches _ a combination that primes the club for its
first championship since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson guided Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls to six
championships in the 1990s and won two championships as a New York
Knicks player in the 1970s. In nine seasons in Chicago, he compiled
a 656-234 record and his .737 winning percentage is tops in NBA
history. Jackson also has a CBA title to his credit, as coach of
the Albany Patroons in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tribute to Jackson's success and reputation that the
Lakers made the hire without so much as sitting in the same room
with him. Most of the negotiations were conducted over the last two
weeks through Musberger, and West did not even talk to Jackson _
who was vacationing in Alaska _ until Monday, when they spoke on
the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The hire clearly signals a new era for the Lakers as they
prepare to move into the $365 million Staples Center this fall.
Having already invested in two of the NBA's best young stars,
Shaquille O'Neal ($121 million) and Kobe Bryant ($71 million), the
Lakers for the first time are investing heavily to obtain the best
available coach.
</P>
<P>
   At $6 or $7 million per season, Jackson easily becomes the
highest-paid coach in franchise history, and his salary would rank
him second in the league, based on last year's figures. His
paycheck by far eclipses that of West's, the team's top basketball
executive, who will make $3.5 million under a new contract that
begins in September.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jerry Buss has historically opted for untested and
less-expensive coaches, often promoting from within the
organization. He was headed in the same direction this time, and
was set to stick with interim coach Kurt Rambis, who was elevated
from assistant in February after the team fired Del Harris.
</P>
<P>
   But two weeks ago, Buss changed course. Motivated by an 11-year
title drought, the need to create excitement to fill a new,
20,000-seat arena, and the lack of widespread support for Rambis,
Buss decided to contact Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Jackson was flirting with the Knicks and
entertaining an extraordinary offer from the New Jersey Nets, who
were prepared to offer in excess of $7 million and part ownership
in the team.
</P>
<P>
   But insiders say Jackson has long eyed the Lakers' job and
simply needed an invitation and a fair offer. Even as he coached
the Bulls to their sixth championship last year, Jackson openly
mused about the idea of coaching the Lakers after a one-year
99bbatical.
</P>
<P>
   During his off-year, Jackson has devoted time to the
presidential campaign of former Sen. Bill Bradley, his friend and
former Knicks teammate. That campaign coincidentally brings Jackson
to L.A. today, and to accommodate his political commitments, the
Lakers are moving their noon press conference to the Beverly
Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   Once the excitement over Jackson's arrival settles, the Lakers
will find a full plate of decisions ahead, starting with filling
out the coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis, a Laker for 13 seasons as player and coach, has already
been assured of a job in the organization, possibly on Jackson's
staff. The fate of Larry Drew, a Lakers assistant for seven years,
is uncertain, as is the status of assistant Bill Bertka, a Lakers
institution for 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   If Jackson decides to install the ``triangle'' offense made
famous in Chicago, he might hire its architect, Bulls assistant Tex
Winter. Winter's contract with the Bulls ends June 30.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson's arrival will mostly spawn stability. His presence
should sate O'Neal, who was furious after the Lakers' playoff
collapse to San Antonio. O'Neal had backed Rambis, but turned on
him by the end of the season and might have considered exercising
an opt-out clause in his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, O'Neal and Bryant, two of the purported heirs to
Jordan's legacy, will get the opportunity to learn from MJ's
longtime mentor.
</P>
<P>
   The third piece of the triangle is the question mark; there are
rumors that question mark might be former Bull Scottie Pippen. But
several sources dispute reports that the Lakers have discussed
sending Glen Rice and Robert Horry to Houston for Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets are refuting the reports outright. ``We're not going
to do anything with Scottie,'' Houston vice president Bob Barr told
the Houston Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Bull Dennis Rodman, briefly a Laker this season, also doesn't
figure to rejoin his former coach; team officials are loath to
gamble on him again.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers do face a decision on Rice, their
somewhat-disgruntled sharpshooter. If he fits into the new
administration's plans, the Lakers can keep Rice for a one-year,
$7.1 million option or let him become a free agent July 1 and give
him a multiyear deal.
</P>
<P>
   He might also be used as bait in a sign-and-trade deal to
acquire a power forward or point guard, or to move up in the June
30 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, the Lakers' ultimate agenda is clear. Jackson
is here to win a championship, or several. And in between, to put a
little Zen in Showtime.

SABRES CALL UP CHARACTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ The reason that minor-league call-up Randy
Cunneyworth was in the lineup Tuesday night for Buffalo was around
his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   His face is littered with bruises and scratches, souvenirs from
the playoff run he just finished with Rochester, the Sabres'
American Hockey League affiliate, and proof that he's one of those
players willing to do anything to win.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly the type of player Sabres coach Lindy Ruff says
he needed for Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he did play with us before, he played very well,'' Ruff
said. ``He supplied some spunk and some character.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunneyworth, 38, also plays left wing, a spot where Buffalo has
been short-handed since back spasms sidelined Michal Grosek.
</P>
<P>
   Cunneyworth said he received word that he had been called up at
2 a.m. while on the Rochester team bus returning from a
season-ending loss in the playoffs. To him, fatigue isn't a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really energized,'' Cunneyworth said. ``Obviously, I know
what is at stake. It's a chance of a lifetime. It's been something
I thought about all year. You hope for a chance like this, and here
it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunneyworth replaced Rob Ray in the Sabres' lineup. LOSING THE
FACEOFFS
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have been dominating the Sabres in the faceoff circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we're not trying,'' Buffalo center Wayne Primeau
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres are trying. The Stars are trying harder. They won 57
percent of the faceoffs in Game 3. Tuesday night, they won 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost a lot of different faceoffs in different places on the
ice,'' Sabres coach Lindy Ruff said. ``We have got to try to get
close to 50 percent against these guys. We know that is tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Primeau said it's tough because the Stars have veteran centers
like Guy Carbonneau and Brian Skrudland who have almost perfected
the art of winning faceoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make sure we have our stick down first,'' Primeau said.
``They've also got a winger in close so when they win the faceoff,
he's there to pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Primeau said the Sabres had been stressing faceoffs on the two
off-days before Game 4. SHUFFLING LINES
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to jump-start his offense, Sabres coach Lindy Ruff
moved forward Joe Juneau to Buffalo's second line with Curtis Brown
and Miroslav Satan in place of Geoff Sanderson.
</P>
<P>
   Sanderson moved to a line with Stu Barnes and Brian Holzinger.
</P>
<P>
   The move not only helped the offense _ the Sabres had four more
shots through two periods in Game 4 (16) than they had all of Game
3 (12) _ it jump-started Sanderson. He had the Sabres' first goal
on a breakaway in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been such a good feeling lately,'' Sanderson said.
``I have been shut down on so many break plays in the playoffs. I
was starting to get a little frustrated with it.''

 -HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
SAN ANTONIO _ Eventually, even on the careful and complimentary
Spurs, someone had to say it.
<TEXT>
<P>
   There had been hints that San Antonio could not help but look at
the No. 8-seeded Knicks, who come limping into town for tonight's
NBA Finals opener, and see a potential mismatch.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Sean Elliott was asked if New York's inexplicable
success made it seem like a team destined for greatness. His
response in a nutshell: No.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may be battling destiny as well,'' Elliott said. ``This
is a team and a franchise that struggled for a lot of years to get
here. We have the players to win it.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurs coach Gregg Popovich reacted similarly to the notion that
the Knicks' ability to overcome injuries and distractions had
proved they had championship mettle.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always say that when you win,'' Popovich said. ``When
you start winning, people say you know how to win. Until you do
that, people say you don't know what the hell is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, finally, guard Mario Elie got to the heart of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not disrespecting the Knicks,'' Elie said, ``but this is
probably the weakest team we're going to play in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, for obvious reasons, have heard it all before. But
winning despite all the doubts has given them reason to welcome
such slights.
</P>
<P>
   They defeated Miami, the Eastern Conference's top seed, and
Indiana, the East's season-long favorite, with center and captain
Patrick Ewing playing hurt and then not at all and with coach Jeff
Van Gundy fighting to keep his job. General manager Ernie Grunfeld
had already failed to keep his, receiving his pink slip shortly
before the regular season ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been the underdog a lot of the regular season and the
whole playoffs,'' Knicks guard Allan Houston said. ``But we never
considered ourselves as underdogs. It's the same thing (now). We'll
leave it to everybody else to not believe in us. We'll keep
believing in ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   But with forward Larry Johnson unlikely to play because of a
sprained right knee, the Knicks have a fresh reason to be doubted.
Johnson on Tuesday still could not predict whether he would play
tonight, and though his knee had improved markedly since Monday, he
said he would be slowed by the injury whenever he returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough,'' he said. ``Even when I do come back bulky brace,
five, six days off, a little bit out of shape. It's tough. But
who's complaining? No excuses. You lower your head and go out and
do what you have to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing low post the way I do, I get by with strength and
quickness. If I've got a bigger guy on me, I try to be quicker.
This has taken away from that. Getting out there and not doing what
I want to do is really going to hamper me.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is the Finals. There's no would have, could have,
should have. It's just going at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson admitted that even if he were not hurt, the matchup
would be difficult for him and the Knicks. For all of New York's
well-earned confidence and its three consecutive Game 1 victories _
all on the road _ the Spurs' strengths do seem to play neatly off
the Knicks' weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm guarding one of the big guys (7-footers Tim Duncan and
David Robinson), I'm pretty sure they're going to have to come
after me,'' Johnson said. ``It's not just my knee. It's the height
disadvantage between me (at 6-6) and one of the twin towers. It's
been that way my whole career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a difficult situation against those guys if
I was 100 percent. If I have to scratch, kick, claw, to do whatever
I can get away with without a foul, that's what I'm going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Johnson, the Knicks typically do not send much
defensive help inside, preferring to let their big men fend for
themselves while Latrell Sprewell, Chris Childs and Charlie Ward
pressure the ball and challenge passing lanes.
</P>
<P>
   If Sprewell were forced to help inside or rotate over to open
shooters, it would seem to cost the Knicks one of their greatest
weapons. But with Ewing and possibly Johnson out, Duncan and
Robinson will test Chris Dudley, Kurt Thomas and Marcus Camby in
ways Eastern Conference big men could not.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pride themselves on defense,'' Duncan said. ``They play
hard. They're going to come out and take it as one of those
underdog challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking at it like that. We're not saying we're
better than they are or we have an advantage over them. But we're
going to go out there and get it done. That's the attitude we've
taken with everybody. There's going to be the effort to go at them,
whether for foul trouble or just to wear them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've had a couple of injuries, so they're a little thinner
than we are. We have to just be able to attack them and take it to
the rim.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Knicks are to make up for the injuries to Ewing and
Johnson, their talented combination of Houston and Sprewell must
deliver. Sprewell moved into the starting lineup soon after Ewing
went out, while Houston took over the Game 6 clincher against
Indiana after Johnson went down Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be more efficient,'' Houston said. ``The ball is
going to be in our hands. We have to make sure we make the right
plays. We can't turn the ball over. We have to get assists. We're
going to be aggressive. But we can't score every point. We learned
in the playoffs you can't do it alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs will have their best perimeter defender, Elie, defend
Houston. And Elliott will finally have a size advantage going
against Sprewell instead of facing the post-up players he has
looked up to throughout the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allan, I think, is really, really the key to their team,''
Elie said. ``I feel I'm the best out-front defender at the guard
position, but Allan is really a tough cover. Allan is great inside
and outside.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Elie left little doubt about the Spurs' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a confident team,'' he said. ``We feel good about
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, having heard it all before, feel the same way. So
much so that they took no offense at the other teams' doubts about
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been underdogs in every series and come out on top,''
Childs said. ``Let them keep it up.''

TWO SIDES LOCKED IN FIERCE FIGHT FOR SWING VOTES ON GUN CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Subs 19th-26th grafs for updating and rewriting) (nk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL and FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the House prepared for a high-stakes, heavily
lobbied debate on youth violence and guns, President Clinton and
pro-gun forces vied fiercely Tuesday for the votes of a critical
group of lawmakers from swing districts who could decide the
outcome of gun control measures.
</P>
<P>
   With the contentious debate fracturing both parties in the
House, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., was working closely with Rep.
Tom DeLay, the majority whip from Texas, on an amendment that would
water down a provision passed by the Senate requiring background
checks on all buyers at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   A confidant Dingell, whose victory would be a blow to the
president and the Democratic House leadership, predicted that he
had enough votes to prevail when the final gun control votes come
on Thursday. ``We will win,'' Dingell said.
</P>
<P>
   But the gun control issue has proven remarkably fluid and
unpredictable this spring, and gun control advocates were not
conceding the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, DeLay warned that the measure Dingell was
sponsoring might run into trouble. Republicans allied with DeLay
said they were concerned that conservatives might not rally around
him to vote for Dingell's amendment because they oppose any
restrictions at all on firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Speaker Dennis Hastert has said Republican leaders
will allow gun control to be a vote of conscience for members,
DeLay has been instrumental in fashioning the structure of the
upcoming debate and the various gun control measures coming to the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   He met last week with Dingell and on Monday with aides to some
Republican moderates. His allies say DeLay is trying to pass some
modest gun control measure to keep Hastert, who virtually promised
some gun control, from another embarrassing defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Republicans said party leaders implored them Tuesday
night to hold together across the next few days and pass some kind
of a consensus bill rather than risk looking like a do-nothing
Congress. Democrats, however, charge DeLay is really trying to doom
any serious restrictions on firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuvering was part of an intensifying fight for votes, as
well as a public relations drive by both parties seeking to appeal
to suburban parents stricken by a horrific series of school
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day both Clinton and a series of Republicans held
competing news conferences on gun control and Republican efforts to
regulate violence in entertainment. Both portray them as issues of
protecting children.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared in the White House Rose Garden surrounded by
female members of Congress from both parties to rally support for
an amendment by Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., that would counter
Dingell's measure and is modeled after the Senate legislation on
gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   In a pointed appeal to suburban women, Clinton cast gun control
as a women's issue, saying, ``Women who belong to both parties in
America, all over this country, have been in the forefront of this
fight. They care about it as mothers, as sisters, as daughters, as
citizens of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   He also implored lawmakers not to heed the National Rifle
Association. ``Once again the gun lobby is resisting with all its
might,'' Clinton said. ``Once again, we're battling not just for
the safety of our families but the soundness of our democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Republicans were trying to shift the focus from
gun control to cultural issues that they said were more responsible
for youth violence. Late Monday, in a surprise maneuver, they
decided to bring two separate bills to the floor _ one on social
and entertainment issues and the other simply on gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, they highlighted measures ranging from federal
permission to post the Ten Commandments in schools to criminal
penalties for adults who allow children access to entertainment
that Republicans described as ``obscenely violent.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo., cast youth violence as an issue of
culture, and said violent material makes it no surprise that
teen-agers ``plan mass murders instead of graduation parties.''
</P>
<P>
   But even some Republicans were opposed to some of the directions
their party was taking. ``This is a big government solution to a
problem that government can actually do little to solve,'' said
Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   On the table in front of him were videos that he said minors
would be prohibited from watching under a key Republican proposal,
including ``Schindler's List,'' ``Lawrence of Arabia,'' ``Mission
Impossible'' and ``Home Alone.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, after a closed-door party caucus, Republicans
on the House Rules Committee began whittling down the nearly 200
measures relating to gun control and youth violence that will be
allowed to the floor for a debate expected to last 15 hours over
two days.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of party-line 8-to-4 votes, the Rules Committee
approved 55 amendments late Tuesday night for debate on the House
floor. Forty-four of them covered cultural, entertainment and crime
issues, including the Ten Commandments measure and several on
school prayer.
</P>
<P>
   On gun control, the Rules Committee approved 11 amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the committee met on Tuesday night, Rep. Dick
Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader, accused the Republicans
of seeking to rig House procedures in their favor. ``This is not a
legislative process,'' he said in a letter to Hastert, ``it is a
deliberate effort to give gun control opponents every advantage
while depriving gun control advocates of vital information.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats kept up the accusation throughout the Rules
Committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The gun control measures that the Rules Committee approved for
full House consideration include both Dingell's and Mrs. McCarthy's
competing gun show amendments. The House will also consider
requirements for child-safety devices on handguns, a raise in the
minimum age for all purchasers of hand guns from 18 to 21, a ban on
imports of high-capacity ammunition clips and new restrictions on
the possession of semi-automatic rifles.
</P>
<P>
   In a particular slap at Democrats, the committee also approved
for debate a measure sponsored by a renegade conservative Democrat
that would repeal a District of Columbia ban on gun possession. And
the Republicans rejected a sweeping Democratic alternative to the
base gun control bill.
</P>
<P>
   With the gun control battle looming, The National Rifle
Association had about a dozen lobbyists working Capitol Hill
against the stricter gun control alternatives while Hand Gun
Control, a gun control group, had set up phone banks to urge gun
control advocates to call Congress. Both sides have also been
running radio ads in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in the Senate, where the breadth of a lawmaker's
constituency leads to a broad view, House members represent
smaller, more homogeneous areas. This makes geography destiny when
it comes to gun control.
</P>
<P>
   So representatives from the cities and their nearby suburbs
generally vote for gun control, including most Democrats and at
least 20 to 30 Republicans. Southerners as well as lawmakers from
the western mountain states and rural areas generally vote against
stringent gun restrictions, including most Republicans and 30 to 40
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Republican nor Democratic party leaders were trying to
make the renegades vote with their party, because of the
recognition that they were making the vote they needed to represent
their district and keep their seat.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the bulk of the lobbying attention was focusing on a
particular group of House members caught in a vise: Republicans and
Democrats whose congressional districts encompass both rural areas
and suburbs, forcing them to balance the views of avid gun owners
against those of increasingly militant suburban parents fearful of
school violence.
</P>
<P>
   These 35 or so people _ perhaps 20 Republicans and 15 Democrats
_ will be key to deciding whether the House passes the same kinds
of gun control measures as the Senate did last month or waters down
the restrictions by defeating some of them and putting in place a
less stringent requirement for criminal background checks on
weapons sales at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday night, Dingell was saying he thought he could draw
a total of more than 40 Democrats to his side, and the gun control
advocates were fearing that as many as 45 Democrats would bolt from
the party. Republican strategists said they thought no more than 35
Republicans would defect to support Mrs. McCarthy's gun show
amendment.

as 45 Democrats would bolt from the party. Republican strategists
said they thought no more than 35 Republicans would defect to
support Ms. McCarthy's gun show amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Several lawmakers said today that they wanted to support some
gun-control measures but had not decided which ones. ``If the
question is, do I want to protect people's rights to own guns and
protect themselves, there's no question about it,'' said
Representative James E. Rogan, a Republican whose California
district stretches from Los Angeles into the surrounding suburbs.
``But I also don't want to see those rights blown into something
that goes beyond common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Maurice D. Hinchey, a New York Democrat whose
upstate district covers Binghamton and a wide swath of the
Catskills, said: ``The sentiments in my district are on both sides
of this issue so what I try to do is be reasonable.'' He said he
did not see an ``awful lot of difference'' between Mrs. McCarthy's
measure on gun shows and Mr. Dingell's. ``I could vote for both of
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Dingell's measure, which reflects the position of the
N.R.A., limits to 24 hours the amount of time permitted to a vendor
for a background check. It also defines gun shows narrowly,
potentially exempting firearms transactions at flea markets. Mrs.
McCarthy's measure gives vendors up to three business days for
background checks at gun shows and defines those events much more
broadly. But the distinctions have taken on such political
significance that Democrats say they may vote against the final
gun-control bill if the version that wins is Mr. Dingell's and seek
to accuse the Republicans of trying to push through a sham bill.
Such a move would probably kill gun control because dozens of
conservatives may also vote against the final bill.

TWO SIDES LOCKED IN FIERCE FIGHT FOR SWING VOTES ON GUN CONTROL

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the House prepared for a high-stakes, heavily
lobbied debate on youth violence and guns, President Clinton and
pro-gun forces vied fiercely Tuesday for the votes of a critical
group of lawmakers from swing districts who could decide the
outcome of gun control measures.
</P>
<P>
   With the contentious debate fracturing both parties in the
House, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., was working closely with Rep.
Tom DeLay, the majority whip from Texas, on an amendment that would

LINKING CEO SALARIES TO EMPLOYEES' DRAWS LIMITED SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ An effort to tie CEO pay more closely to
average worker salaries met with limited support at eight corporate
annual meetings this spring.
</P>
<P>
   {United for a Fair Economy}, a Boston-based organization that is
trying to reduce the pay gap between top executives and their
employees, reported Friday that more than 500 million shareholder
votes were cast in favor of gap-shrinking resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, all of the resolutions failed by wide margins.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest support for pay equalization came from shareholders
of {R.R. Donnelley}, which met in March. A resolution on gender-
and race-based pay equity received 16.6 percent of the vote at the
printing company.
</P>
<P>
   The Fair Economy organization selected the eight corporations as
those where corporate leaders received large pay increases while
rank-and-file jobs were being cut.
</P>
<P>
   At seven of the corporations, Fair Economy-backed resolutions
called for CEO pay to be tied to a multiple of the lowest-paid
worker's pay at the company. The seven companies and the vote
percentages:
</P>
<P>
   {AlliedSignal}, 12 percent for and 88 percent against.
</P>
<P>
   {AT&AMP;T}, 7.6 percent for and 92.4 percent against.
</P>
<P>
   {BankAmerica}, 6.7 percent for and 93.3 percent against.
</P>
<P>
   {BankBoston}, 4.8 percent for and 95.2 percent against.
</P>
<P>
   {Citigroup}, 10.8 percent for and 89.2 percent against.
</P>
<P>
   {General Electric}, 5 percent for and 95 percent against.
</P>
<P>
   {Huffy}, 8.3 percent for and 91.7 percent against.
</P>
<P>
   The shareholder resolutions were sponsored by Responsible
Wealth, a project of United for a Fair Economy that is a network of
more than 400 affluent Americans who are concerned about economic
inequality.
</P>
<P>
   Responsible Wealth spokesmen said they were not dispirited by
the votes. They said annual meeting voting procedures typically
favored management in proxy voting.
</P>
<P>
   Responsible Wealth spokesmen also said they were glad to have
started a dialogue on the pay issue. Management at AT&AMP;T,
BankAmerica and BankBoston issued statements acknowledging that
growing pay gaps were a social and business problem.
</P>
<P>
   The group intends to continue its efforts in August by
introducing a shareholder resolution at Computer Associates' annual
meeting. Next year, it intends to resubmit resolutions at several
of the corporations and submit more resolutions elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Members also are pledging to push mutual fund managers to
disclose their proxy voting records, something that typically is
kept secret by most mutual funds.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAN ANTONIO _ This story has become typical New York. Bigger,
louder and supposedly better than anyplace else.
</P>
<P>
   It might as well have been written, produced and directed by
Spike Lee and Woody Allen, who would have us all believe that
anything from outside the five boroughs is wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   New York gave us style, sophistication and the $6 cup of coffee,
while the rest of the world merely offers right turn on red.
</P>
<P>
   Now New York gives us the Knicks, who we are supposed to believe
have invented teamwork, enthusiasm and a whole new way to the play
basketball, probably along with a cure for the common cold.
</P>
<P>
   To hear the tabloids scream it, the Knicks, in this magical
spring of the No. 8 seed in the playoffs, have discovered a way to
make the ball rounder, the baskets bigger and each game another
step along the path to enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   We are being told that Marcus Camby, a player who could not
break into the starting lineup all season long, is now ready to
take his place alongside the World Trade Center towers and the
Empire State Building as one of Manhattan's skyscrapers.
</P>
<P>
   We are being told that Latrell Sprewell _ he of the choke hold _
and Allan Houston _ he of the disappearing acts _ are now capable
of performing more feats of magic than Siegfried &AMP; Roy.
</P>
<P>
   We are being told that Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy, a rumpled
little fellow, is now the basketball equivalent of Werner von Braun
at the dawning of the U.S. space program.
</P>
<P>
   This is all so quaint, so familiar, so New York, the biggest
little city in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the traveling party who made the trip with the Knicks
probably thought they needed a passport to get inside our Texas
borders.
</P>
<P>
   Forgive them if they think that any time they are outside the
sniffing distance of the New Jersey plants and the Turnpike, they
believe they're in a foreign country. And you'll have to forgive
them, of course, for barely knowing the names of the starting
lineup for the San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   It's only natural that the Knicks and their bandwagon rolled
into town with the notion they are a team of destiny. After all,
when a New Yorker burps, he usually believes it is some kind of
inner sign from God, not merely a breath of sour air that still
smells better than the inside of any taxi on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Knicks are destiny's children. If, that is, you believe
somebody out there in the cruel world is always fated to get the
wrong end of the stick.
</P>
<P>
   We are being told over and over by the New York hype that the
Knicks are special, and indeed, they are. No team in recent playoff
memory has had a more fortuitous path covered with rose petals to
the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks won their first-round matchup with Miami in the final
seconds of Game 5 when a running heave by Houston practically wore
out the iron on the rim before rolling in.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks practically had a bye in the second round when
overrated Atlanta didn't even bother to compete.
</P>
<P>
   That put the Knicks into the Eastern Conference finals against
the Indiana Pacers, who practically disintegrated before their
eyes. Rik Smits broke his toe and went to hide in a corner. Reggie
Miller shriveled up. The Davis boys, Antonio and Dale, took turns
vanishing. And still it took a positively horrible call by referee
Jess Kersey on Larry Johnson's four-point play for the Knicks to
win Game 2 and a 3-for-18 shooting effort by Miller to give them
Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   There are delirious comparisons being made between Camby and
Bill Russell, between the Sprewell-Houston backcourt and the Hall
of Fame combo of Walt Frazier and Earl Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   This is the way it is in New York, where they believe that if
you yell it loud enough and long enough, it is true. It always
happens when a New York team is involved. It is always the
toughest, the strongest, the best.
</P>
<P>
   At least as far as New Yorkers can see. Which is usually only as
far as the west bank of the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   What the Knicks' bandwagon can't or won't see is that any one of
three other Western Conference teams _ Portland, Utah and the
Lakers _ would be prohibitive favorites in this series. What they
can't or won't see is that the Spurs' first three playoff opponents
_ Minnesota, LA and Portland _ were all more formidable than the
Knicks. And the Spurs swept those last two series over the Lakers
and Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   What they can't or won't see is how David Robinson and Tim
Duncan will swallow them up and end this quaint Manhattan fairy
tale in quick fashion.
</P>
<P>
   It is a typical New York story, made up of so much noise.

SEVERAL CHANGES COULD BE ON THE HORIZON FOR NHL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ NHL general managers met in Buffalo on Tuesday
and talked over several issues. The GMs are allowed to make
suggestions to the Board of Governors, who then vote on possible
changes.
</P>
<P>
   The GMs voted to recommend reducing the size of a goalie's
``catcher'' from 50 inches in circumference to 48 inches. They also
discussed moving the schedule ahead to start on Oct. 1. They
discussed the possibility of changing the ``in the crease'' rule
from ``no skate in the crease'' to ``no harm, no foul.'' And they
discussed the possibility of recommending trying to look into a
softer form of the seamless glass that is being used in new arenas
and has resulted in more shoulder and head injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pushed some things in the direction they need to be pushed
to effect further change,'' Stars GM Bob Gainey said. ``We didn't
do anything today, but we tried to move things along on their
proper track.''
</P>
<P>
   The league GMs will gather again at the draft in late June. HULL
SITS
</P>
<P>
   Stars winger Brett Hull sat out Tuesday night's game with a
strained groin and could miss Game 5, Stars coach Ken Hitchcock
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea if he is going to be a player for Game 5,''
Hitchcock said. ``He has made significant progress and I think our
next step is to get him on the ice and see where it goes. But he is
not ready to go on the ice right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock moved Tony Hrkac to the first line with Mike Modano
and Jere Lehtinen and added rookie Jon Sim on the fourth line.
Darryl Sydor stayed on defense and did not move to forward. HOGUE
REMAINS SIDELINED
</P>
<P>
   Stars winger Benoit Hogue skated Tuesday for the second day on
his injured left knee and said he felt much better. However, he
still doesn't know if he will be able to play in Game 5 Thursday at
Reunion Arena in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is day-to-day,'' he said. ``I know after skating
(Tuesday) I can't play, but I don't know how it will respond
(Wednesday),'' Hogue said. All I know is I need to be able to help
the team and not hurt the team, and I won't say I'm ready to come
in unless I know I'm ready to come in and help.'' TUREK'S TRADE
STATUS
</P>
<P>
   Stars goalie Roman Turek will likely be traded by the team
before the expansion draft on June 25, so the Stars will not lose
their backup goalie without getting an asset in return. The Atlanta
Thrashers, who can pick up to five goalies, have said they would
probably select Turek if he is left available. The Stars are
allowed to protect only one goalie.
</P>
<P>
   Turek said he knows all of the situations, but that he would
rather not hear about whether he's going to be traded or not. He
told his agent, Rich Winter, to keep tuned into potential trade
talks, but not to tell him anything until the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to enjoy Stanley Cup Finals, I don't want to hear
any of that stuff,'' Turek, from the Czech Republic, said. He was
16-3-3 during the regular season and has drawn the most interest
from the Tampa Bay Lightning. nn

 BOEING LANDS HUGE ORDER FOR 737s AT PARIS AIR SHOW  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ International Lease Finance Corp. has ordered 50 of
Boeing's next generation 737s with options for 50 more, making it
the biggest order ever for the next generation family of airplanes
built in Renton, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   With the options, the value of the order is about $4.5 billion
based on the average list price of the various mix of planes.
</P>
<P>
   But International Lease reportedly received steep discounts from
Boeing, so much so that some analysts said Boeing may still be
going for market share over archrival Airbus Industrie rather than
trying to improve its minuscule commercial profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not true,'' Alan Mulally, president of the
Commercial Airplanes group, said in an interview following the
order announcement Tuesday at the Paris Air Show.
</P>
<P>
   He said the deal was good business, for Boeing and International
Lease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of this deal,'' Mulally said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has said its goal is to increase profit margins on its
commercial airplanes to 10 percent, and Mulally said the
transaction with International Lease was ``supportive of Boeing's
approach toward making a reasonable financial return ... this is
absolutely supportive of moving in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   At an earlier news conference for the order announcement, Steven
Udvar-Hazy, president and chief executive of International Lease,
was asked about the discount his leasing company received for the
737-700s, 737-800s and 737-900s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only say we did not pay retail price,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said negotiations took six months, and he described them as
``hard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A transaction of this size is very complex,'' he said, adding
that he believes the final result was a ``win-win'' situation for
Boeing and International Lease.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is under a lot of pressure to improve its commercial
financial performance, and top executives have vowed they will
sacrifice market share for profitability, even if it means losing
an order on price to Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   But Byron Callan, aerospace analyst for Merrill Lynch who is in
Paris for the air show, said if the discounts are as steep as he
has heard, then he would begin to question Boeing's commitment to
better jetliner margins.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing delivered a record 563 commercial jetliners last year,
but made no profit on those planes. Mulally, in the interview, said
Boeing has not changed its previous projection that commercial
margins this year and next will be 2 percent to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Nisbet, an industry analyst with JSA Research, did a recent
analysis that concluded Boeing last year sold its planes below the
cost of producing them, with average prices paid by customers 14
percent to 27 percent below list prices.
</P>
<P>
   Nisbet did his analysis to quantify Boeing's practice of
discounting its jetliners to customers in its price war with
Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Tuesday, Nisbet said he does not know
how much discount Boeing gave International Lease on the 50 firm
orders.
</P>
<P>
   But the discount was likely steep, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a foregone conclusion that these huge orders from
leasing companies are full of deep discounts because they mean so
much to Boeing and Airbus in terms of market share,'' Nisbet said.
</P>
<P>
   One factor to consider in trying to understand if the deal is
good for Boeing is the delivery date of the planes ordered, he
said. If the deliveries mean Boeing can keep production rates high,
then the cost of each plane is less. ``In that case, Boeing could
offer some discounts without hurting its earnings,'' Nisbet said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Boeing probably went beyond `some' with an order of that
size,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus also announced a billion-dollar order Tuesday by
Singapore Aircraft Leasing Enterprise for 20 A320s and three A321s.
</P>
<P>
   The Airbus announcement,though, was overshadowed by the
International Lease order for Boeing planes.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Udvar-Hazy said the first delivery in the
new orders will come in early 2001, and if the additional 50
airplanes are confirmed, deliveries would continue until 2007.
</P>
<P>
   He called the next generation 737 a ``cornerstone of our
portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest order brings to 360 the number of 737s that
International Leasing owns, including planes that have not yet been
delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Separately Tuesday, Boeing received orders from Korean Air Lines
Co. for two 747-400 freighters. The airline said it would replace
two Airbus A300 freighters when it accepts delivery of the new
plans, currently set or May and June of next year.

LUDWIG PICKS WRONG TIME TO COMMIT COSTLY BLUNDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Craig Ludwig was late getting back to his locker
Tuesday night after the Sabres' 2-1 victory against the Stars in
Game 4 squared the Stanley Cup Finals at two games apiece.
</P>
<P>
   There's a joke in there somewhere, but it seems too cruel to
trot out the obvious punch line.
</P>
<P>
   By now you've probably caught ``The Play'' on ESPN, CNN-SI, or
the Cartoon Network, whatever you happened to be watching late
Tuesday night or this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to say that's never happened to me before,'' Ludwig
said, ``but I'd be lying. It's just that now it's the playoffs and
everything is magnified.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, you might say that.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanley Cup Finals are heading to Dallas for Game 5 Thursday
night and this teeter-totter of a playoff series is balanced once
again. The Sabres' victory also assured a return to Buffalo's
Marine Midland Arena for Game 6 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig might be sentenced to drive the bus.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' veteran defenseman has had nightmares like this. He's
even had games like this one. They just didn't happen in the
Stanley Cup Finals, with the entire hockey world watching.
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig's turnover in the slot allowed Buffalo's Dixon Ward to
drill the tiebreaking goal past Eddie Belfour early in the second
period and the Sabres' defense, led by Dominik Hasek's superb play
in net, made it stand up for the third one-goal victory in the
series.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams have been separated by only one goal or tied for
all but 26 seconds in four games.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars dominated the first and third periods, outshot the
Sabres 31-18, including 13-2 in the final 20 minutes, but made two
critical mistakes and both wound up in the net behind Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   ``You give up a couple of goals,'' Ludwig said, ``and that guy
(Hasek) gives them a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   This should have been a 1-0 Dallas victory and if it had been,
we'd all be singing Belfour's praises and talking about another
suffocating job by the Stars' defense.
</P>
<P>
   Messrs. Chambers and Ludwig, front and center, please.
</P>
<P>
   You see, Ludwig wasn't the only Stars' defenseman who was
blushing Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   First came Shawn Chambers, who also had that horrendous
performance in Game 5 against Colorado, when he was a minus-4 ``for
the game'' in a 7-5 Stars' loss.
</P>
<P>
   His one big boo-boo in this game came with about 12 minutes
remaining in the first period, when he allowed Pat Verbeek's pass
to skip over his stick at the Sabres' blue line. Geoff Sanderson
raced past him, skated in on Belfour unchallenged and slipped it
past him after faking the Dallas goalie to the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chambers was unfortunate because we really had great cycle
rotation going and his stick hooked in the boards, I guess,'' Stars
coach Ken Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   We're all guessing, Hitch, since Chambers didn't make a postgame
appearance to face the media. Ludwig may have been slow, but at
least when he arrived at his locker, he stayed until everyone had
their shot at him.
</P>
<P>
   None hurt as much as the one Ward stung him with in the second
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd just dumped it out of their zone and I went out to get
it,'' Ludwig said, trying to reconstruct the play. ``I was going to
get it over to Shawn. That's what we've been doing the whole
series, just trying to get the pucks out of the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just hit the top of my stick and went right on (Ward's)
tape. He put it in. I may have even screened Eddie or (the shot)
might have even hit me, I don't know. I looked back and saw it in
the net and wanted to throw up.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates tried desperately to get him off the hook and
failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels real bad,'' teammate Darryl Sydor said. ``As a team,
we're all together in this. We hurt for him right now, but he's a
character player and he'll bounce back.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he will. But he'll replay this one for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was rolling and bouncing, but no more than a hundred others
I've handled,'' Ludwig said. ``I could have done 10 different
things with it. I could have fallen on it or I could have picked it
up and thrown it in the stands. Obviously I didn't do the right
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things happen in games all the time. It's happened to me
before. Just not in a game that was this important. They take
advantage of mistakes. They see a crack, they're through it and
(Hasek) slams the door. We didn't give Eddie a chance on either of
those goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Dallas, the debate has raged over the parade route once
the Stars win the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Note to parade director: Better include a return trip to Buffalo
in those plans. nn

 Students give time, attention to more deprived youngsters  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WINSTON ROSS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Daniel Clark understands that life in the
inner city is not easy.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty, he knows, presents the most talented and capable youth
with daunting challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel has faced those challenges, too. Even now, his room at
home is too small for a bed. But he managed to win a scholarship to
Rockhurst High School, and this week 10 of his classmates get to
see some of what he has experienced.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel and the 10 others are sleeping on church floors and
spending time with youngsters from the most deprived areas of
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The students are working at St. Louis Church on Swope Parkway as
part of a new program called the Total Ignatian Experience.
</P>
<P>
   School administrators at Rockhurst chose the students on the
basis of scholarship and overall achievement. They deliver food to
the church, study, play with and be mentors to children enrolled in
the church's youth program, Upper Room. They also serve dinner at
soup kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel sees the week as a chance to give something back to the
community. He wants to show his younger peers that success is
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these kids are very intelligent,'' he said. ``I've
seen both sides, and I realize these kids can do it. They don't
realize that sometimes it's not their fault.''
</P>
<P>
   What is challenging for the other Rockhurst students is to be
plunged into an environment that, for most of them, is completely
foreign. .MDNM/They don't know what it's like to worry about their
next meals or how long they will have a roof over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Rockhurst's Aaron Clevinger said listening to inner-city
residents' stories of hardship made him think twice about his own
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're comfortable, you start taking things for
granted,'' he said. ``I thought, coming in, you could do anything
you wanted as long as you're motivated to do it. Here, there's so
much against them.''
</P>
<P>
   The week is part academia, part hard labor, and all fun, said
the students. And the children enjoy working with their older
mentors.
</P>
<P>
   Rockhurst teacher Peg Mulvihill is coordinating the volunteer
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're being `men for others' '' she said. ``This gives them
the chance to have a different outlook.''

FAMILY FILES SUIT OVER WRESTLER'S FATAL FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE VENDEL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The harness that suspended Owen Hart was
unsafe and inadequate to hold the 230-pound professional wrestler
who fell to his death last month, a lawsuit filed Tuesday alleged.
</P>
<P>
   Hart's family named 13 defendants _ including the World
Wrestling Federation and the city of Kansas City _ in the
wrongful-death lawsuit, filed in Jackson County Circuit Court. The
lawsuit, which seeks an undetermined amount of money, stemmed from
the May 23 accident that killed Hart at Kemper Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Hart, 34, of Calgary, Alberta, was supposed to enter the ring
from a catwalk 78 feet above the ring. As he dangled in mid-air,
waiting for his cue, a quick-release mechanism on his vest opened
prematurely, dropping him to his death, said police who
investigated the accident.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleged that the stunt was dangerous and poorly
planned. In particular, the lawsuit alleged that the harness system
was defective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our legal and factual allegation is that Owen Hart died
because this makeshift contraption was totally inadequate for this
intended purpose,'' family attorney Gary Robb said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   He said the mechanism used to support Hart was intended to rig
sailboats.
</P>
<P>
   Robb said Hart could have moved his shoulder and triggered the
harness' quick-release mechanism on his vest. He said it took only
six pounds of pressure to trigger the mechanism. In comparison, it
takes eight pounds of pressure to pull the trigger of a Kansas City
police officer's handgun, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   The 118-page lawsuit lists 46 separate counts against the
defendants, who include the WWF; Vince McMahon, the WWF's chairman;
and the city, as owner of Kemper Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The city is covered by an insurance policy paid for by the WWF.
All arena lessees are required to buy liability insurance to
protect the city, said William LaMette, director of convention
centers. City officials declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Other defendants in the lawsuit include WWF's parent company,
Titan Sports, four companies that manufactured or sold the
harness-and-cable system and four riggers who set up the stunt.
Three riggers were on the catwalk with Hart before he fell. The
role of the fourth rigger was not clear.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the defendants contacted Tuesday were not aware that
they had been named in the lawsuit. Some declined to comment;
others did not return telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the lawsuit, police are investigating whether criminal
acts contributed to Hart's death. Their investigation is focused on
the appropriateness of the equipment used by Hart to see whether
anyone was criminally negligent.
</P>
<P>
   WWF Spokesman Jim Byrne said his company had not yet been served
with the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to respond to a lawsuit that hasn't been seen
yet,'' he said. ``The police investigation is still ongoing, so it
would seem the lawsuit is precipitous.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrne declined to discuss the equipment used by Hart. He said
Hart had performed the stunt a few times before.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit claimed precautions were missing, such as a safety
net, safety harness, backup cables or a safety lock on the release
mechanism. Owen Hart also was not properly trained, the lawsuit
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to Owen Hart was absolutely preventable,'' said
Pamela Fischer, a family attorney from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Hart's widow, Martha Hart;
their two children, ages 7 and 3; and Owen Hart's parents, all of
Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   Hart's widow, Martha Hart, said she decided to file the lawsuit
to hold accountable those responsible for her husband's death and
to protect other wrestlers from unsafe conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Professional wrestling has become a showy display of graphic
violence, sexual themes and ever more dangerous stunts,'' she said.
``The WWF has deliberately chosen to promote profit at the expense
of the most basic safety of its performers.''

HASEK SUPPLIES CZECH-LIST, BRUISING SABRES RESPOND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Desperate times call for desperate Czech
messages.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Dominik Hasek's Czech-O-Gram to his teammates was
that he was the goalie. They were the goal scorers. And it was time
to get up off the Stanley Cup floor and take care of business.
</P>
<P>
   Message deliveritch, Sabres. Seizing two unexpected gift
opportunities handed them by the Stars, the Sabres rode Hasek's
steel-trap goaltending to a 2-1 victory Tuesday night, knotting the
Stanley Cup finals at two games apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The (trumpets, please) world's greatest goaltender had laid out
his wishes on the eve of Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be more aggressive,'' Hasek implored. ``More forechecking. Go
after them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do it as a unit. It can't be one guy being aggressive and four
guys waiting at the blue line.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the puck dropped Tuesday night, and the desperate Sabres
commenced an all-night massage. If you believe in statistics, the
NHL bruise-counters had Buffalo with 34 hits delivered to the
Stars' 16. That's more than a two-to-one edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, he said it all, really,'' Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff said.
``He said to bring it on, and I kind of echoed those sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you play it safe and try to win the game, 1-0, it's not
going to happen. Emotionally, he was the leader of the game for us
and he set the tone.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek stopped 30 of 31 shots, and his performance ranged from
everyday brilliant to the Hasek we know from the Vezina trophies
and the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it's not as if the Stars rained a hailstorm of golden
scoring chances at him.
</P>
<P>
   With a chance to seize a commanding 3-1 edge in the series, the
Stars lost far too many physical battles and failed to convert the
handful of rebound opportunities that Hasek presented them.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview room later, Stars coach Ken Hitchcock was
lobbed a verbal softball by a writer trying to elicit some praise
for Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I don't think,'' Hitch said, his voice sounding a tad
drained by what had happened. ``I mean, he was good. Eddie
(Belfour) was good, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think, though, that Hasek was the factor in the game.
I thought Hasek was good and he made some great saves, but you know
what? So did Eddie.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock, I suspect, wasn't being discourteous as much as he
was still seething over the uncharacteristic way in which his
veteran team literally handed Buffalo the game.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Chambers' turnover at the blue line, instantly transformed
into Geoff Sanderson's goal, was in some ways not shocking.
Chambers, in general, has had some dreadful moments in these
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But fellow defenseman Craig Ludwig's blunder, which spoon-fed
Dixon Ward with the eventual game-winning goal, was not the sort of
thing you'd expect from a 17-year NHL veteran. Behind the Stars
bench, the camera caught Hitchcock muttering a one-syllable
profanity after the Ludwig mistake.
</P>
<P>
   So much for those Capt. Kangaroo comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Hitch calmly observed later: ``Everybody makes individual
mistakes like that. Those guys have played a lot of minutes and
played well for us in this series.''
</P>
<P>
   He called Ludwig's pass ``flippy'' and suggested that Chambers'
error was ``unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe ``he'' needs to listen to Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate times, after all, call for desperate Czech messages.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it wasn't anything that the Sabres' offense did that
scuttled the Stars here Tuesday night. They managed only 18 shots
on goal. Only two shots came in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres' offensive game plan still looks like the road map
for those TV crash-test dummies. Let's see _ dump to the corner ...
go to the body ... hope somebody kicks the puck free for a
centering pass.
</P>
<P>
   Don't anyone with Buffalo wings on their breath ever again dare
to call the Stars' offensive style boring. Don't dare.
</P>
<P>
   But because their goalie spoke, the Sabres did listen. Handed
the lead for keeps just eight minutes into the second period,
Buffalo finally attacked with some sense of abandon. It might have
been their best period since the overtime of Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dominik said that if this team is going to get physical, then
I am going to get involved, too,'' Ruff noted.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek did. And on this night, the Stars had no answer, either in
Czech or any other language.
</P>
<P>
   If there an Eddie-gram in the offing?

SABRES TURN ON JETS, TIE STANLEY CUP SERIES 2-2
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ The puck fluttered on Craig Ludwig's stick for
one moment. And a few seconds later, butterflies fluttered in the
stomach of the Stars' defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   In the time it took to make a routine pass _ or mess up a
routine pass, in Ludwig's case _ the Stanley Cup Finals took a
sharp turn. Ludwig's second-period turnover led to Dixon Ward's
game-winning goal in a 2-1 Buffalo Sabres victory against the Stars
in Game 4 last night at Marine Midland Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The best-of-seven series is tied at 2-2 heading into Game 5
tomorrow night at Reunion Arena. And while the Stars have home-ice
advantage in what amounts to a best-of-three series, Ludwig said he
and his teammates learned a hard lesson in just how tight the
margin of error is in this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of these goaltenders are playing so great that a little
break here or there is all teams are looking for,'' Ludwig said.
</P>
<P>
   Goalies Dominik Hasek of the Sabres and Ed Belfour of the Stars
each came up with spectacular performances. And that put even more
emphasis on two giveaways; Stars defenseman Shawn Chambers also had
a gaffe that led to a unassisted goal for the Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig's giveaway, in particular, changed the game. With the
score tied at 1-1 and the Stars controlling play in the first seven
minutes of the second period, Ludwig failed to control a bouncing
puck before he attempted a cross-ice pass to Chambers. The puck sat
out in the high slot, and Ward was able to scoop it up and head in
on Belfour. Ludwig then compounded the problem by trying to block
the shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I screened Eddie on it, and he didn't have a chance,''
Ludwig said.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the game turned into a street brawl as each side
fought for territory, fought for chances to rile the goaltenders
and fought to get a puck in the net. At one point, Hasek went after
Stars captain Derian Hatcher and ended up being cross-checked by
Pat Verbeek in a scrum. Near the end, the teams exchanged verbal
and physical assaults and there were 10 minutes of combined
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both teams are so good at feeding off mistakes, they feed off
that and wait for it,'' said center Mike Modano, who was held
without a goal for the ninth consecutive playoff game. ``It's
getting a little heated; frustration is building on both sides.
It's time to dig in and get dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars thought they had dug in pretty well, churning out 31
shots on goal to go with 12 missed shots. In the meantime, they
held the Sabres to 18 shots and seven missed shots. The Stars often
controlled the puck deep in the Sabres' end of the ice for long
stretches and basically carried over the near flawless game plan
they executed in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Sabres were a much improved team over Game 3. They
were more intense, they were more physical, they were more
committed on defense. In short, the regained their confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a must-win for us,'' defenseman Jason Woolley said.
``There's a reason why we got here. We're a very good team with a
great goaltender.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres scored first for the third time in the series and
this time made the first goal matter. Sabres winger Geoff Sanderson
was able to pick up a loose puck off the stick of Chambers and race
up to drop in a backhand on Belfour in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, however, countered with Jere Lehtinen's power-play
goal 2:05 later. The score stayed that way until Ward watched the
biggest gift of the playoffs land in his lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it just got our energy going,'' he said. ``We started
throwing everything at them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig reflected on what is surely going to be called the worst
mistake of his career. But, he said, he couldn't dwell on the
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have done 10 different things,'' Ludwig said. ``I
could have fell on it, or I could have picked it up and thrown it
in the stands. Obviously, I didn't do the right thing, but that's
part of hockey.''

OATES VENTS ANGER AFTER RANGERS LOSE TO YANKEES (For use by NYTimes
News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Texas Rangers manager Johnny Oates exploded in anger.
</P>
<P>
   Oates' outburst perhaps exceeded that displayed by the weekend
hacker who chunks a 150-yard approach shot into water with an
8-iron, but the manager's message _ the family version _ would be
similar.
</P>
<P>
   No mulligans.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Ryan Glynn needed one in New York's six-run second
inning of Tuesday night's 6-2 loss at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Glynn (0-1) retired 14 of the 17 batters the Yankees
sent to the plate during his six-inning appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter!'' Oates screamed before clearing his office
of postgame company after the Rangers' season-high, four-game
losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Oates' display could be described as highly uncharacteristic for
an otherwise patient, even-tempered manager.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn's response matched that of Oates, but it lacked the
intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we could do that,'' Glynn said of disregarding that
second inning. ``If I get out of that inning with three runs, maybe
it's a different game. I feel like I let my team down.''
</P>
<P>
   It unfolded without warning.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn's 1-2-3 first inning included strikeouts of shortstop
Derek Jeter and right fielder Paul O'Neill, but a second-inning,
leadoff walk issued to center fielder Bernie Williams set the
wheels of disaster in motion.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Tino Martinez and designated hitter Chili Davis
collected consecutive singles, and Davis' hit scored Williams with
the Yankees' first run and tied the game.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn retired left fielder Shane Spencer before allowing a
run-scoring double to third baseman Luis Sojo, but the 24-year-old
rookie appeared to gain control of the situation by retiring
catcher Joe Girardi on a routine fly ball to right field for the
inning's second out.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, though, drew a two-out walk on a
wild pitch that allowed Davis to cross the plate with the Yankees'
third run, and Jeter sealed the Rangers' fate with his three-run,
opposite-field home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have never put myself in that situation,'' Glynn
said. ``I should have never walked Knoblauch.''
</P>
<P>
   Glynn threw Jeter a first-pitch fastball away and attempted to
go away with a slider on his second pitch. That pitch was supposed
to set up a third-pitch fastball in on Jeter's fists.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn, though, never got to throw that third pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit a slider out, a very bad slider,'' Glynn said. ``It was
a bad pitch. I think a low (Class) A-ball hitter could have hit
that one out of the ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter certainly did. It measured 382 feet and gave the Yankees a
6-1 lead with right-hander David Cone on top of his game. Cone
(7-2) surrendered only two runs on four hits and two walks and
recorded six strikeouts in his seven-inning appearance. It also
gave Cone his 10th victory in 13 career decisions against the
Rangers and improved his earned-run average to 2.17 in those games.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn allowed only a fourth-inning walk to Sojo and sixth-inning
singles to Davis and Spencer after Jeter's home run, but it didn't
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately in this game, you can't throw out the bad
innings or the bad at-bats,'' Oates said. ``That's all part of it.
Sometimes one bad pitch can cost you a ballgame.''

SABRES FOLLOW GUIDELINE TO VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ After their humbling 2-1 loss in Game 3 Saturday
night, the Buffalo Sabres went into last night's critical Game 4
with a long checklist of do's and don'ts.
</P>
<P>
   Do take more wrist shots, and do fake some of those shots to
avoid blocks by Dallas defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Do forecheck hard in the Dallas zone to create turnovers and
scoring opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Do pinch in the defensemen when controlling the puck deep in
Stars' territory to create more chances.
</P>
<P>
   Do get ineffective scorer Miroslav Satan involved in the
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Don't take stupid penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The Game 4 scorecard: Check, check, check, check and check.
</P>
<P>
   The result: A 2-1 victory that turned the Stanley Cup Finals
into a best-of-three series heading back to Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The turnaround from Game 3 had the Sabres feeling good going
back on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always going to say we can improve our overall game, but
we want to build off this game today,'' defenseman Jay McKee said.
``We're pretty happy with the way we played. We were more
aggressive with the puck, and breaking down their defensive zone.
Everybody's a little more up now. We're excited to get back to
Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres showed early in the first period that they'd learned
the lessons coach Lindy Ruff had been teaching them the past two
off days when Geoff Sanderson scored on a fake and a wrist shot
against Ed Belfour, not a blast from long distance.
</P>
<P>
   The game-winner came off a foray deep into Dallas territory by
winger Dixon Ward after he intercepted an errant Craig Ludwig pass.
Ward, too, used a wrist shot to beat Belfour _ after avoiding
Ludwig's attempted shot block.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was going to go down on one knee,'' said Ward, who
added that he was so intent on avoiding a block that he didn't even
look at the net as he shot.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the game, Sabres' attackers used fakes to avert shot
blocks, then fired quick wristers rather than long-windup slap
shots. Meanwhile, defenders joined the rush in the Dallas zone.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Buffalo players acknowledged the improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't like the way we worked in Game 3,'' said defenseman
Jason Woolley. ``We did a lot of stupid things. We're a lot smarter
team than that and we started to make smart plays tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the smartest things Buffalo did was listen to goalie
Dominik Hasek, who urged his blueliners to jump into the rush and
help boost the Sabres' anemic attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the reasons we were able to get more pressure
in their zone,'' said McKee. ``Throughout the playoffs, our
defensemen have been able to pinch and we got back to that today.
We kept some pucks in the zone and that helped us.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Sabres' pinching defensemen helped the Buffalo
offense, aggressive forechecking aided the Buffalo defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight,'' Woolley said, ``when they turned around, we were in
their face.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres accomplished two other objectives. They continued to
play rough _ dishing out 34 hits to 16 for Dallas _ but limited the
Stars to just three power-play opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   And, while he didn't score, regular season leading goal-scorer
Satan had a strong game, skating well and creating chances.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL SULLIVAN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
BUFFALO, N.Y. _ In the end, the mood was one of chagrin more than
anger.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The two goals that made the difference were giveaways, a point
even the winners would concede. At the other end, plenty of
opportunities had been missed. When it was done, the Dallas Stars
seemed to realize they had dominated Game 4 of the Stanley Cup
Finals everywhere but on the big board hanging at the center of
Marine Midland Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Stars, that was the scoreboard, which read
``Buffalo 2, Dallas 1'' at the end of a different sort of Tuesday
night of hockey, one that left an increasingly strange
best-of-seven series tied at two games apiece.
</P>
<P>
   What to make of all this?
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought most of this game was passion and emotion,'' Sabres
coach Lindy Ruff said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars saw it differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take a look at the two plays, and there were some very
lucky bounces on their part,'' center Mike Modano said with a
shrug. ``That's hockey in June.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Stars and Sabres will play hockey a little longer _ at
least two more games _ after an offbeat evening in which Dallas
outshot Buffalo 31-18 (including a 13-2 edge in the final period)
and controlled the flow, yet contributed to its demise with two
highly uncharacteristic defensive gaffes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a couple of mistakes that gave them their two goals,''
Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Game 5 is Thursday night at Reunion Arena, leaving the Stars
little time to dwell on the opportunity lost. If there was
something naggingly familiar about the whole experience, though,
there is good reason for that. In the Western Conference finals
against Colorado, Dallas won Game 3 on the road. With a chance to
go up 3-1 in the series, the Stars got off to a slow start in Game
4, rallied, then lost 3-2 in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, this was worse, because the Stars needed only to
look in the mirror to find the chief culprits.
</P>
<P>
   First, there was a Shawn Chambers giveaway in the offensive end
that quickly turned into a Geoff Sanderson breakaway goal midway
through the first period, energizing a crowd that was beginning to
lose some enthusiasm in the face of another slow Buffalo start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether it was the ice or mishandling the puck,''
Sanderson said, ``but it was nice to capitalize on the few mistakes
they made.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Stars drew even, there would be another inexplicable
blunder. This time, Dixon Ward took a gift in the form of a fumbled
pass by Craig Ludwig and wristing a shot past Ed Belfour (18 shots,
16 saves) for what proved to be the winning goal 7 minutes, 37
seconds into the second period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were really playing well at that time,'' Hitchcock said.
``It was really coming. Then we gave it easily, and it kind of took
the wind out of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Excuses? Sure, this was a virtual must-win situation for
Buffalo. And yes, Dallas went without wing Brett Hull, who sat out
the game with a groin injury suffered in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all of that, the Stars left town with a split that
produced more letdown than satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   With goalie Dominik Hasek (who stopped 30 of 31 shots) exhorting
his team to pick up the pace on the offensive end, the Sabres were
more aggressive than in Game 3, when they got off just 12 shots.
Still, Dallas seemed to be weathering the storm before Chambers
failed to control a pass from Pat Verbeek in the offensive end.
</P>
<P>
   Sanderson was off on a breakaway down the left side. He pulled
up as if winding up for a slap shot, then cruised by Belfour and
eased the puck beyond the sprawled goalie's grasp 8:09 into the
opening period.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was up. Hasek pumped his arms in celebration. A little
more than two minutes later, though, the party was back on hold.
</P>
<P>
   On a power play, Modano got the puck behind the net and found
Jere Lehtinen in the slot. Lehtinen beat Hasek to the goalie's
right, tying the score at 1 at 10:14.
</P>
<P>
   The second period began with the Stars finishing up a power
play, but it was the Sabres who were taking the offensive. Again,
Buffalo got a little help when Ludwig virtually handed the puck to
Ward, who quickly cashed in by beating the partially screened
Belfour just inside the left post.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were two rare mistakes for them to make defensively,''
Ward said. ``We were fortunate enough to take advantage of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas pressed the issue in the third but to no avail. So the
series heads back to Texas, with each team already having won a
game on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dallas is probably a little better team than us,'' Ruff said.
``But we still think we can beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Sabres have a better chance now; the Stars will
hope another bit of recent history doesn't repeat itself: After
losing Game 4 in Denver, Dallas dropped Game 5 at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to play error-free to win now,'' Modano said. ``At
this time of year, that's what it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars fell a little short in that department Tuesday night.
Come Thursday, they might begin to find out if more than just
margin for error was lost.

   MEXICO CITY _ A strong earthquake rattled central Mexico today,
killing at least 14 people and injuring dozens as buildings
collapsed in and around the capital of Puebla state, east of Mexico
City, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from Puebla put the death toll at 12 there. Landslides
blocked several rural highways in Puebla and Oaxaca, reports said.
Two people were killed in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   The quake was felt strongly in Mexico City. Thousands of
residents fled into the streets as buildings swayed. Telephone
service was interrupted in much of the city for several hours.
</P>
<P>
   The National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.,
measured the quake at 6.5 on the Richter scale. The National
Seismological Center of Mexico recorded it at 6.7.
</P>
<P>
   The quake struck at 3:42 p.m. and both services located its
epicenter in a rural area 125 miles southeast of here, along a
volcanic border that divides Oaxaca and Puebla. Authorities in
Oaxaca said they had been unable to establish communication with
Huajuapan, the rural area at the epicenter.
</P>
<P>
   The worst damage in preliminary reports was in the center of the
city of Puebla, 55 miles east of here. The defense secretary, Gen.
Enrique Cervantes, said at least five people were killed around
Puebla. Parts of the Puebla City Hall collapsed, killing one woman
and temporarily trapping 12 municipal workers, who were rescued.
Dozens of other structures suffered heavy damage. The dome of the
San Augustine church collapsed, and the tower of another church, La
Concepcion, also suffered heavy damage.
</P>
<P>
   Radio announcements reported the deaths of at least five
additional people and the collapse of hundreds of houses in towns
and villages across the state of Puebla.
</P>
<P>
   The Puebla Red Cross reported that it had treated 200 people for
injuries like broken bones and shock. A spokesman said the injured
streamed into clinics hours after the quake.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo, who was in the Caribbean resort city
of Cancun, spoke in an interview with a radio station here 90
minutes after the quake. He said he had ordered his secretaries of
interior, defense and transport, as well as the head of the Federal
Electricity Utility, to travel immediately to Puebla to oversee
relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The Volkswagen plant in Puebla, supplier of the Volkswagen
Beetle and the New Beetle, suspended production and ordered
buildings inspected for damage.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico City, a handful of buildings appeared to have suffered
severe damage, although they did not collapse.

CONTROVERSIAL CREDIT CARD PRACTICES ANGER CUSTOMERS, STATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE HADLEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Peter Laurie of Poulsbo, Wash., called Ticketmaster
Northwest recently to order tickets to a Tom Jones concert.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks later, the Lauries received a copy of
Entertainment Weekly in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   An envelope that came with it said that unless the Lauries
called to cancel, their credit card would be billed $19.95 for 20
weeks of the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Laurie, wondering how Entertainment Weekly could bill
their credit card automatically, called the 800 number listed on
the envelope.
</P>
<P>
   She was told the company would just bill the credit card number
Peter Laurie had used to order the concert tickets through
Ticketmaster.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Laurie was outraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot believe they have the right to give my credit card
number to anybody,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A Ticketmaster Northwest official denied that the company gives
credit card information to other companies. Ticketmaster has a
contract with Entertainment Weekly to market the magazine to people
who buy tickets through Ticketmaster, said Curt Logan, general
manager of Ticketmaster Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   When someone calls Ticketmaster to buy concert tickets, the
operator will at that time offer them a free trial subscription to
Entertainment Weekly, Logan said.
</P>
<P>
   The customer has to agree to the offer and will be billed only
if they don't cancel at the end of eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Lauries say they weren't offered and didn't agree to a trial
subscription. Logan said if that's true, the operator should be
fired.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups call Ticketmaster's practice ``unacceptable''
and cite it as one example of a growing trend of banks and other
companies using consumers' credit card information to bill them
without their explicit approval.
</P>
<P>
   The Lauries' case is in the early stages _ the state Attorney
General's Office plans to send them a complaint form.
</P>
<P>
   But across the nation attorneys general and other authorities
have begun taking aim at controversial credit card practices,
particularly in the banking industry.
</P>
<P>
   Developments in the past week include:
</P>
<P>
   _U.S. Comptroller John Hawke said the practice of banks selling
customer information to telemarketing firms was growing and is
``seamy.'' He warned the industry it could be risking a crackdown
by legislators or regulators.
</P>
<P>
   _Minnesota Attorney General Mike Hatch announced a lawsuit
against US Bank for allegedly sharing customers' private banking
information with Member Works Inc. in exchange for fees of $4
million, plus commissions of 22 percent on net sale revenues.
Member Works is a Connecticut telemarketer that sells myriad club
memberships based on buying habits.
</P>
<P>
   _Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives introduced a
bill that would bar banks from sharing credit and bank account
numbers or giving access to accounts for telemarketing purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public, when they find out that the bank can take their
most sacred personal financial information and put it on the
Internet or sell it to a telemarketer _ people go through the roof.
And they're fully justified in that,'' said Rep. Jay Inslee,
D-Wash., a co-sponsor of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Inslee introduced a broader bill last month that would require
banks to tell consumers their intent to sell information and allow
consumers to refuse.
</P>
<P>
   _Bank of America, which owns Seafirst Bank, announced it would
change its privacy policies and no longer share any customer
information with third-party marketers who offer their products and
services to Bank of America customers.
</P>
<P>
   At least one customer was not pleased with Seafirst's earlier
policy. In April, Woodinville resident Linda Crosby said she had
recently been billed $59.95 on her credit card by CUC Shopper's
Advantage, a club she'd never heard of.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lady at Seafirst told me that my credit card does not belong
to me. It belongs to them and therefore they can have these other
companies do what they want with it,'' Crosby said. ``I can't
believe this is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America spokesman John Cleghorn said Friday, ``We're not
going to do business of that kind any more.''
</P>
<P>
   The Post-Intelligencer in April reported on complaints by
Washington state residents against Member Works and against
BrandDirect Marketing, another Connecticut-based telemarketing
company that sells club memberships.
</P>
<P>
   The complaining consumers said they were billed without their
approval for memberships in Outdoor Explorer's Club, SmartSource
and other clubs they did not recognize or want.
</P>
<P>
   The credit card issuers, which include Chase Manhattan Bank,
Travelers Bank, General Electric Consumer Appliance Finance and
Exxon, said most of the consumers had agreed to the billings in
telemarketing calls, but the consumers were not aware that they had
and never gave out their credit card numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The telemarketing companies, however, already had either the
numbers or enough information to bill their cards.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota attorney general alleged that scripts read by
Member Works' telemarketers were deceptive.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Attorney General's Office says it is currently
investigating BrandDirect Marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Ticketmaster's practices are no better than those of the banks
selling account information, said Ed Mierzwinski, a Washington,
D.C., lobbyist for US PIRG, which represents WashPIRG, a local
consumer and environmental advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   The Lauries, the Poulsbo couple, called Ticketmaster to buy a
ticket, not to buy a magazine, Mierzwinski said. If they want to
buy the magazine, they can call again and give their credit card
number for that, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are taking advantage of you,'' said Mierzwinski.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't just keep your credit card number and trick you
into buying things.''
</P>
<P>
   Logan of Ticketmaster Northwest said it's not always
Ticketmaster pushing the magazine on consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Many consumers want the magazine because of its eight- to
16-page insert that tells what Northwest events are coming up, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Logan said sometimes an operator trying to make ``an extra
buck'' will sign people up without their permission, but they're
fired if anyone finds out.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie is skeptical. She said she was called by a company
wanting to sell her a satellite dish. The company told her it got
her name through Ticketmaster and could bill it to her credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Logan said Ticketmaster has no connection with a satellite dish
company. ``We absolutely do not give anybody's credit card
information to anybody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another consumer had the same complaint as the Lauries about
Ticketmaster and filed a complaint in December with the Attorney
General's Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was purchasing tickets for `Disney on Ice' entertainment,
not a subscription to a magazine,'' Kenmore resident Kristian Leite
wrote in his complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Ticketmaster has found a new way for them to
generate additional revenue at my expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I, as a simple consumer, protect myself if every time
I use my credit card, the business will take the information and
give it to anybody willing to buy it?''
</P>
<P>
   A Ticketmaster official responded that Leite's experience was
``a miscommunication on the part of the operator who processed your
ticket order.''
</P>
<P>
   He said ``appropriate measures'' were being taken ``to avoid
future complaints of this nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General Paula Selis said Washington state has
a law called the Unsolicited Goods Act that prohibits sending
something to someone without their positive assent and then billing
them later for it.

KNICKS BENEFIT FROM EWING'S MISFORTUNE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He won an NCAA basketball title and was named one of the 50
greatest NBA players of all time. He has led his team in scoring
average 11 seasons and had them within a game of the 1994 NBA
title.
</P>
<P>
   He is, having spent 14 seasons wearing the blue and orange, Mr.
New York Knick.
</P>
<P>
   But alas, the New York Knicks are better off now without Patrick
Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is terrible if you are a Ewing fan, for he has led
them to the playoffs for 11 consecutive seasons. Throughout all of
the coaching changes and front-office changes, Ewing has been as
consistent as a New York traffic jam.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, when the Knicks center was lost for the rest of the
playoffs with a partially torn Achilles' tendon in Game 2 of the
Eastern Conference finals, the Knicks became a better team.
</P>
<P>
   Swingmen Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell fuel a Knicks team
that runs more and creates more offense in the open court. Post
Marcus Camby has fresher legs.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Knicks are heavy underdogs against the San
Antonio Spurs in the NBA Finals, which begin Wednesday night. But
New York has a better chance of scoring points against Tim Duncan
and Co. without the plodding, 36-year-old Ewing slowing down the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're playing awfully well without him,'' said Spurs guard
Steve Kerr, a member of the past three championship teams with the
Chicago Bulls. ``They're doing an amazing job.''
</P>
<P>
   So what should this say about the Ewing legacy?
</P>
<P>
   Even though injuries have marred his past two seasons _ he
missed 56 games in 1997-98 with a dislocated wrist _ you can't
argue about Ewing's career production. He has been an All-Star 11
times, and he has put together seven seasons averaging 20 or more
points and 10 or more rebounds per game.
</P>
<P>
   No, if you are a Ewing fan, you look at the old Knick and wonder
how things could have been if he had one more weapon for all those
wars with Larry Bird and Michael Jordan; a point guard to get him
the ball perhaps, or a small forward to take some of the scoring
load off of him.
</P>
<P>
   He rarely had that kind of help. In six career playoff series
against Jordan's Bulls or Bird's Celtics, Ewing's Knicks were 1-5,
including 0-4 against Jordan. The Knicks did break through against
Chicago in the 1994 Eastern Conference semifinals. But that victory
came with Jordan in temporary retirement. The series outcome may
have been different if not for a questionable foul call on Scottie
Pippen in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   But that's another column.
</P>
<P>
   This columnist feels for Ewing, and Charles Barkley, and Karl
Malone, and any other perennial superstar drafted in the mid-1980s
who has been part of the league's highlights only to play second to
Jordan every year.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's retirement was supposed to give one of these guys a
chance to win it all. Barkley's Rockets and Malone's Jazz did not
even make it to the conference finals. Ewing, of course, is hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel bad for (Ewing),'' said Spurs center David Robinson,
who is making his first NBA Finals appearance. ``As you know, those
opportunities don't come very often.''
</P>
<P>
   They might never come again for Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard sitting here watching, but that's my fate,'' Ewing
said. ``I've just got to do whatever I can do by talking to the
guys and cheering them.''
</P>
<P>
   So his place in history, for the most part, must be measured
against the other big men of his day. In his prime he was as
consistent a scorer as Shaquille O'Neal, and as solid a defender as
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   But he was outclassed in his one and only chance in the Finals.
In a one-on-one matchup against Hakeem Olajuwon's Houston Rockets
in the 1994 NBA Finals, the Knicks fell in seven games and Ewing
could not prevent Olajuwon from being selected the series' most
valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing won't have a hand in these Finals. But perhaps an upset
series victory by the Knicks could help change his legacy a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither one of us has won one yet,'' Ewing said of himself and
Robinson. ``At the end of this series one of us is going to walk
away knowing that they're the champions.'' nn

OATES VENTS ANGER AFTER RANGERS' LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rangers manager Johnny Oates exploded in anger.
</P>
<P>
   Oates' outburst perhaps exceeded that displayed by the weekend
hacker who chunks a 150-yard approach shot into water with an
8-iron, but the manager's message _ the family version _ would be
similar.
</P>
<P>
   No mulligans.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Ryan Glynn needed one in New York's six-run second
inning of last night's 6-2 loss at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Glynn (0-1) retired 14 of the 17 batters the Yankees
sent to the plate during his six-inning appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter!'' Oates screamed before clearing his office
of post-game company after the Rangers' season-high, four-game
losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Oates' display could be described as highly uncharacteristic for
an otherwise patient, even-tempered manager.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn's response matched that of Oates, but it lacked the
intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we could do that,'' Glynn said of disregarding that
second inning. ``If I get out of that inning with three runs, maybe
it's a different game. I feel like I let my team down.''
</P>
<P>
   It unfolded without warning.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn's 1-2-3 first inning included strikeouts of shortstop
Derek Jeter and right fielder Paul O'Neill, but a second-inning,
leadoff walk issued to center fielder Bernie Williams set the
wheels of disaster in motion.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Tino Martinez and designated hitter Chili Davis
collected consecutive singles, and Davis' hit scored Williams with
the Yankees' first run and tied the game.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn retired left fielder Shane Spencer before allowing a
run-scoring double to third baseman Luis Sojo, but the 24-year-old
rookie appeared to gain control of the situation by retiring
catcher Joe Girardi on a routine fly ball to right field for the
inning's second out.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, though, drew a two-out walk on a
wild pitch that allowed Davis to cross the plate with the Yankees'
third run, and Jeter sealed the Rangers' fate with his three-run,
opposite-field home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have never put myself in that situation,'' Glynn
said. ``I should have never walked Knoblauch.''
</P>
<P>
   Glynn threw Jeter a first-pitch fastball away and attempted to
go away with a slider on his second pitch. That pitch was supposed
to set up a third-pitch fastball in on Jeter's fists.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn, though, never got to throw that third pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit a slider out, a very bad slider,'' Glynn said. ``It was
a bad pitch. I think a low \RClass\S A-ball hitter could have hit
that one out of the ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter certainly did. It measured 382 feet and gave the Yankees a
6-1 lead with right-hander David Cone on top of his game. Cone
(7-2) surrendered only two runs on four hits and two walks and
recorded six strikeouts in his seven-inning appearance. It also
gave Cone his 10th victory in 13 career decisions against the
Rangers and improved his earned-run average to 2.17 in those games.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn allowed only a fourth-inning walk to Sojo and sixth-inning
singles to Davis and Spencer after Jeter's home run, but it didn't
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately in this game, you can't throw out the bad
innings or the bad at-bats,'' Oates said. ``That's all part of it.
Sometimes one bad pitch can cost you a ballgame.''

SABRES' HASEK SURVIVES STARS' PUSH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Jennifer Floyd 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Buffalo Sabres goalie Dominik Hasek gulped,
taking a deep breath as time expired in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   He had just spent 20 minutes flailing, sprawling and diving at
chance after chance being tossed his way by Stars players, and he
had survived.
</P>
<P>
   His survival led to a Sabres revival, a 2-1 victory last night
at Marine Midland Arena sending the best-of-seven Stanley Cup
Finals series back to Dallas for Game 5 tied 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember two, maybe three, good scoring chances for
Dallas,'' Sabres defenseman Jason Woolley said of that final-period
push. ``That's where Dom came up and made some big saves.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek had challenged his teammates to play more aggressive going
into Game 4. He said he'd handle any mistakes if his teammates were
too aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, he said it all really,'' Sabres coach Lindy Ruff said.
``He said what he said and what he said was `Bring it on.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Stars players brought ``it'' and a little more in the third
period.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres went into the third period with a 2-1 lead. The Stars
went into the third period with both sticks blazing. They outshot
the Sabres 13-2, including 5-0 in the first five minutes. The
Sabres didn't get their first shot on goal in the period until 6:27
remained.
</P>
<P>
   Sabres forward Randy Cunneyworth fired a shot on net that Erik
Rasmussen tipped right into the waiting hands of Stars goalie Ed
Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   The shots were 10-1 at that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't give them a lot of quality shots,'' Ruff said. ``We
gave them outside shots, and they came on hard. You have to give
them credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Stars chances were once again created by Joe
Nieuwendyk's line. He, along with Jamie Langenbrunner and Dave
Reid, were constantly providing Hasek with chances to bolster his
image as unbeatable when leading after two periods in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffalo goaltender has a 19-0 mark in playoff games when he
has a lead after two periods.
</P>
<P>
   Reid had an outstanding chance at 12:15, creeping from behind
Hasek and stepping into the slot. He tried to lift the puck high,
but Hasek got it with his leg pads.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the ones we have to have,'' Reid said. ``I
didn't get a good shot off.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo's best save, though, came from a Sabres player other
than Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   The goaltender had come too far out of the net to challenge a
Langenbrunner rush, leaving the goal wide open. Langenbrunner
whipped a pass from behind the net that defenseman Craig Ludwig
corralled at the blue line. Ludwig turned and launched a shot but
Cunneyworth used his body as a buffer.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek was still scrambling to get back in net.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times we have sat back on leads in the third period,''
Sabres defenseman Jay McKee said. ``We talked about that on the
bench, and we came out and responded.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek, too.
</P>
<P>
   He told his teammates that he'd have their backs, and he more
than delivered in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Dominik's telling the team to be more aggressive,
\Rsaying\S `Don't worry I'll bail you out if you give up the
odd-man rush' ... you know he did that tonight,'' Geoff Sanderson
said. ``He made some great saves for us and he held us in the game
in the third period.''

CAN THE BELEAGUERED KNICKS BIG MEN STOP SPURS' TOWERING DUO? (For

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Even Don King would have trouble drumming up
enthusiasm for this NBA Finals mismatch:
</P>
<P>
   In the Spurs' corner, two of the most agile, productive
7-footers in the NBA. They combine to average 36 points, 20
rebounds and five blocks per game. Ladies and gentlemen, a former
MVP and a future MVP, David Robinson and Tim Duncan!
</P>
<P>
   And in the Knicks' corner, um, one of the worst shooters in NBA
history and another guy who a year ago was an assistant coach for
the Mavericks. Ladies and gentlemen, Chris Dudley and Kurt Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may seem like we should have our way, but the Knicks
wouldn't be here without those two guys,'' Robinson said. ``They're
physical, they've got a little mean streak and they don't give an
inch. We're not expecting it to be easy at all.''
</P>
<P>
   As if sneaking around as the Eastern Conference's eighth seed
and not having the homecourt advantage against a team that is 42-6
since March weren't enough, the New York Knicks will likely be
without their top two low-post players in Game 1 of the NBA Finals
against the Spurs Wednesday night at the Alamodome. Center Patrick
Ewing (Achilles' tendon) is definitely out for the series, and
forward Larry Johnson, fresh off his heroics in Games 3 and 5 of
the Eastern Conference finals, is questionable with a sprained
knee.
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson can't play, Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy will attempt
to stop San Antonio's Twin Towers with Thomas on Duncan, Dudley on
Robinson and _ no kidding _ 38-year-old ex-Mavericks player Herb
Williams as a key reserve.
</P>
<P>
   With the Spurs' having lost only twice in the past two months,
most experts are predicting a speed bump of a series against a team
of Knick-knacks who, looking like an aging Ferrari with a busted
fan belt, seem one tweak away from suiting up Spike Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a huge discrepancy in points in the paint, rebounds
or free throws, we're in big trouble,'' Van Gundy said. ``It's what
they thrive on, and so do we. Their size usually turns teams into
jump shooters. We can't win a series from the perimeter.''
</P>
<P>
   With the 29 points and 15 rebounds of Ewing-Johnson on the
bench, it's hard to imagine the Knicks denting San Antonio's Twin
Peaks. Of course, after a 27-23 regular season, it was difficult to
see the Knicks advancing past the first round, much less this far.
Not lost on the Spurs is the fact that during their run from
eight-to-great, the Knicks have disposed of star centers in Miami's
Alonzo Mourning, Atlanta's Dikembe Mutombo and Indiana's Rik Smits.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're so active, they kept Smits in foul trouble the whole
series,'' Robinson said. ``And they kept Dikembe and Mourning under
wraps. We're talking about great players. Patrick won't be here,
but the rest of those guys are all about defense, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Dudley, owner of possibly the ugliest free-throw motion in the
history of basketball, will likely bang with Robinson down low
while the more athletic Thomas will chase Duncan on the perimeter.
Williams has played only 13 minutes in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Expect New York to try to disrupt San Antonio's offense by
trapping the ball out of point guard Avery Johnson's hands, then
fronting Duncan or Robinson to make the Spurs throw lob passes over
the defense. Offensively, the Knicks must have spark plugs Latrell
Sprewell and Marcus Camby create points in the transition game and
not get caught up into a half-court game with the methodically
powerful Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio, meanwhile, will attempt to continue its strategy of
funneling the opponent toward shot-blockers Robinson and Duncan at
one end while feeding the 7-footers for easy shots or pass-out
3-pointers at the other end.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a scary team,'' Spurs point guard Avery Johnson said
of the Knicks. ``They believe in their destiny, and they're really
talking up that underdog stuff. We've got to stick with our plan
and plug up our ears or they can beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs, who will have the support of 40,000 fans, also
realize the key to the Knicks' playoff upsets were victories in
Game 1 at Miami, Atlanta and Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, two months ago they said we were a soft team going
nowhere,'' Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ``Now, those same
people are saying how we're like the old Celtics about to steamroll
to the title. Well, I don't buy that one either, and I hope our
players don't.'' nn

IRVIN'S STATUS WITH COWBOYS STILL UNCERTAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ After being a no-show at the morning workout,
disgruntled receiver Michael Irvin was on the practice field for
the afternoon workout Tuesday as the Dallas Cowboys opened a
three-day minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   And he was looking and talking like the team's all-time leading
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   His situation, however, is far from resolved, even after a
nearly two-hour conversation with Cowboys owner Jerry Jones that
prevented Irvin from attending the opening workout at Valley Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get into the status of where we are at this
time,'' Jones said. ``We had a good visit, and he will contribute
in camp this week.''
</P>
<P>
   The same, however, can't be said about linebacker Randall
Godfrey, who didn't practice Tuesday because he refused to accept
and sign the Cowboys' contract offer. The Cowboys don't know if
Godfrey, a restricted free agent, will sign before the end of
minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   As for Irvin, Jones said he would like to have the 12-year
veteran on the team in 1999 and possibly for the rest of his career
``under the right circumstances.'' However, he said Irvin's
presence at then minicamp should not be seen as an indication that
anything has been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, whose contract expires after this season, is miffed that
the Cowboys haven't offered him an extension. He has also given the
Cowboys permission to trade him.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, citing changes in the offense that don't rely on
one primary receiver and Irvin's age (33), want to wait until the
end of the season to talk about a contract beyond 1999. They have
also discussed Irvin in trade talks with other teams.
</P>
<P>
   And, a source said the Cowboys are even considering cutting him
if they feel his attitude will be counter-productive to the team.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, declined to comment after the morning meeting, saying
``there was nothing to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   He jumped into his car and left. He returned a few hours later,
shielding himself from news media by entrance to the practice
field,]sandwiching himself between offensive linemen Everett McIver
and Erik Williams.
</P>
<P>
   During practice, Irvin caught a few passes and unleashed his
usual amount of trash talk.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey was pleased to see Irvin on the field
after he missed all of the team's voluntary workouts the past
couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked like he was in good shape,'' Gailey said. ``He's got
a lot of catching up to do. But it's good to have him on the field
working out and playing hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said there was never any doubt Irvin would work hard.
Jones said there is just a question of how Irvin would mentally
handle his evolving role in the offense and the impact on his
contract situation because of the changed role.
</P>
<P>
   To Jones, the 1999 season is not an issue, as Irvin has a base
salary of $2.99 million. But Jones is not ready to discuss a
contract beyond 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing things differently than we did in 1992 and even
two years ago,'' Jones said. ``It's harder and harder to find a
team where one receiver gets all the balls. And he is working in
his mind on how this is going to work in the last year of his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mike deserves and has earned the right to sort through
and feel comfortable with everything. He just needs to sort through
and get it together inside.''
</P>
<P>
   The same can be said of Godfrey, who believes the Cowboys' offer
of $429,000 for 1999 is unfair. Jones, however, said the team
doesn't plan to offer more. Godfrey's agent, Ben Dogra,
acknowledged that his client is still struggling with the offer,
but he believes Godfrey will likely sign at some point. He just
doesn't know when.
</P>
<P>
   While Gailey would like Godfrey on the field working to learn
the middle linebacker position _ after playing strongside
linebacker the past three seasons _ Jones said it would worry him
more if Godfrey was missing time at training camp. nn

KINGS PURSUING PALFFY?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Kings' seemingly eternal quest to acquire a marquee player
has been anything but fruitful. Pavel Bure eluded their grasp, as
did Theo Fleury and Zigmund Palffy, leaving the Kings without the
showpiece player they covet for the opening of the Staples Center
in four months.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy, however, has re-entered the picture.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' Dave Taylor, in Buffalo for general managers'
meetings, confirmed Tuesday that he has had discussions with the
New York Islanders about a trade for Palffy, the New York
Islanders' high-scoring right wing.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN reported that the Islanders want right wing Pavel Rosa or
center Olli Jokinen, two of the Kings' best young players, for the
27-year-old Palffy.
</P>
<P>
   However, a source in New York said Rosa and Jokinen are not
involved in the discussions, but that the Kings are considering a
deal that would include several prospects, among them 1998
first-round draft choice Mathieu Biron, a defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings also have the rights to 21-year-old defenseman Aki
Berg, who played this season in his native Finland. In dealing for
Palffy, the Kings also might receive 31-year-old defenseman Rich
Pilon, the source said.

PLAYERS UNION FILES GRIEVANCE FOR MAVERICKS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The National Basketball Players Association filed a
grievance yesterday on behalf of the Mavericks, who were fined
$25,000 by the NBA last week for picking up the tab on a trip to
Hawaii for free-agent power forward Gary Trent and several members
of his family.
</P>
<P>
   Association spokesman Dan Wasserman said the league was out of
bounds for fining the Mavericks. Arbitrator Kenneth Dam, a law
professor from the University of Chicago, is to hear the case
within 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Granik, NBA deputy commissioner and chief operating
officer, said Mavericks general manager Don Nelson violated the
salary cap and provisions of the collective-bargaining agreement by
paying for the trip to Maui, Hawaii, three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Wasserman said the fine violates procedures laid out in the
collective-bargaining agreement. Wasserman said charges pertaining
to salary-cap violations must be determined by an arbitrator _ not
by the league without a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a precedent, which we can't tolerate,'' Wasserman
said. ``Teams interested in free agents have frequently provided
transportation and lodging for a player and his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recruiting a player, speaking with a player and trying to
convince the player that signing with a team is in his best
interest, and trying to convince the player and his family that
living in a particular city is in his best interest, has never been
and is not a salary-cap violation.''

THOMAS SAYS DEAL NEVER MADE WITH MAVS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Kurt Thomas spent Tuesday defending himself.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, he'll defend Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to Texas for the first time since bolting the
Mavericks and signing a free-agent contract with the Knicks, the
former TCU star called Dallas coach and general manager Don Nelson
a liar while downplaying the Spurs' front line of Duncan and David
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   With Patrick Ewing out and Larry Johnson questionable for Game 1
Wednesday, Thomas likely will be New York's only low-post threat.
Defensively, look for him to start out guarding Duncan but switch
to Robinson at some point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played some pretty good centers in the playoffs and
found ways to not let them dominate us,'' Thomas said. ``I don't
see why that's going to change now.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who attended Dallas' Hillcrest High School before
leading the nation in scoring and rebounding at TCU, played in only
five games over two seasons for the Mavericks while recovering from
ankle fractures. Before training camp in January, Nelson said
Thomas verbally agreed to a one-year contract before flying to New
York less than 24 hours later and accepting a two-year, $4 million
deal with the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's bull,'' said Thomas, who expects 30 family members and
friends at Wednesday's game. ``There were things still to be worked
out, and Nellie knows that. The Knicks made me a better offer, and
the Mavericks decided to shell out their money on Hot Rod Williams.
What can I say? This is a business.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who said he flirted with the idea of retiring after
suffering a third ankle injury while jogging at SMU in 1997, said
his daily routine now includes a good pinch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed every day where I am,'' Thomas said. ``A lot of
people gave up on me, and it's a miracle that I'm back playing at
all. But not only that, here I am in the Finals.'' JOHNSON MIGHT
PLAY
</P>
<P>
   Knicks forward and Dallas native Larry Johnson remains a
game-time decision for Wednesday because of a sprained right knee.
Johnson, injured Friday in a game against Indiana, hobbled through
Tuesday's workout wearing a brace but said he won't really test the
knee as far as full-speed cutting and running until hours before
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Worse than not playing would be to go out there and be able to
do only 70 percent of what I normally do,'' Johnson said. BEST AND
WORST
</P>
<P>
   Best omen for Spurs: All but one of the past 20 NBA champions
finished the regular season with one of the league's top three
records. Only the 1994-95 Rockets (10th) bucked the trend. The
Spurs had the league's best record, but the 27-23 Knicks could
become the team with the second-worst regular-season record to win
the NBA Finals, behind the 1977-78 Washington Bullets at 44-38.
</P>
<P>
   Worst predictions:] It was Portland's Damon Stoudamire who said
Spurs point guard Avery Johnson would never lead a team to the
Finals, and ditto for the Nets' Stephon Marbury about New York's
Charlie Ward and Chris Childs. ``That's why this world is so
crazy,'' Childs said. ``People flap their mouths without having a
clue about what they're talking about.'' NUMBERS GAME
</P>
<P>
   37-15: NBA Finals record of teams with the home-court advantage.
24 SECONDS
</P>
<P>
   While most of the country predicts a Spurs victory, Michael
Jordan picked the
</P>
<P>
   Knicks in six. ``After all those years of beating them, he's
probably just throwing them a bone,'' said Spurs guard and former
Jordan teammate Steve Kerr. ... Coaches Gregg Popovich and Jeff Van
Gundy never played in the NBA, marking the first Finals since
Boston's Bill Fitch and Houston's Del Harris in 1981 when neither
coach had playing experience. Popovich and Van Gundy were
assistants under Don Nelson at Golden State and New York. nn

NEW HAMPSHIRE SWAMPED BIG NAMES MONTHS BEFORE PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Presidential Campaign 2000 kicked off in
earnest this week, looking like a rush to judgment. Even veterans
of New Hampshire's always-hectic first-in-the-nation primary seemed
put off by the early stampede of candidates through this city of
70,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early, if you ask me,'' said David Woodcock, 48, a
retired U.S. Navy petty officer, as he sat with friends in front of
Lala's Hungarian Pastry in downtown Manchester. ``This all could
have waited until next year.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the candidates, next year will be too late. Here in New
Hampshire, Republicans flocked feverishly to back Texas Gov. George
W. Bush. Elsewhere in the nation, states scrambled for early spots
in the primary process, worried that the race could be over by late
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the two front-runners took their initial steps: Bush,
the top Republican contestant, waded into Iowa and New Hampshire
for the first time and Vice President Al Gore, the leading
Democrat, prepared to announce his candidacy in Tennessee
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, Bush will make his first foray into
California, where he will hit cities with heavy Hispanic
populations to trumpet his credentials as a coalition-building
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   He already has made his mark as a fund raiser, having officially
attracted $7.6 million, more than three times the amount pulled in
by his nearest rival in the money sweepstakes, former Vice
President Dan Quayle, who took in $2.1 million in the first quarter
of the campaign cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Other GOP candidates, who have been courting voters in the early
primary states for months now, have struggled to raise cash and to
make their voices heard amid the din surrounding Bush.
</P>
<P>
   University of Virginia political science Professor Larry Sabato
said the frenzy has been pumped up by huge sums gushing into
certain campaigns and the front-loading of the primary and caucus
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no room for second thoughts, for buyer's remorse,''
Sabato said. ``If you were in a loony bin and were designing a
process for presidential selection, this is the process you would
put together.''
</P>
<P>
   And most of the candidates show no signs of reining in their
efforts. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., spent much of the week in
Senate business but still found time for a couple of campaign
speeches in Chicago and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In major campaign action:
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Gore will officially kick off his campaign for
president in his hometown, Carthage, Tenn., marking the start of
his faceoff with challenger Bill Bradley, a former senator from New
Jersey. Bradley is campaigning in California in an attempt to spark
support for his upstart bid.
</P>
<P>
   Publishing magnate Steve Forbes will add to his already bulging
campaign till Wednesday with a Wall Street fund-raiser expected to
bring in $1.1 million. The dinner will be broadcast live over the
Internet on Forbes' Web site and will be preceded by an ``Internet
reception'' during which the candidate will take questions.
</P>
<P>
   But nowhere was the action as intense as in New Hampshire. Mary
Sysyn, an alderman from Manchester, said the pace of campaigning
has been picking up in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's par for the course, but it didn't used to heat up
this early,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Forbes will travel to New Hampshire to christen his
local campaign headquarters. Quayle will make a campaign stop in
New Hampshire Wednesday to attempt to bolster his position in this
state, which he views as critical to his presidential fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   In only his second day of campaigning in New Hampshire, Bush was
clearly causing a stir with voters, who turned out in respectable
numbers to meet the candidate during his tour through Derry on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Bush made stops in New Castle, Bow, Goffstown and
Manchester, finally showing his hand on several issues, answering
at least some of the recent criticism that he was seeking to become
the party's standard bearer without exposing his views to the
sometimes searing scrutiny of his competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told New Hampshire residents that he would not subject
Supreme Court nominees to an abortion litmus test, and made it
clear during campaign stops that he would ``make my stand'' on
moderate Republican ground.
</P>
<P>
   Standing outside the Merrimack Restaurant in downtown
Manchester, pharmacist John Karas speculated that the Bush push was
designed to end-run the regular campaign process and anoint Bush
without a real fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a united front by the Republicans to get one
candidate out early,'' Karas said. ``Maybe it's a little too
early.''
</P>
<P>
   A poll taken a week ago by the ``Boston Herald'' demonstrated
how much territory Bush's rivals for the GOP nomination must cover.
</P>
<P>
   Likely New Hampshire Republican voters favored Bush. He led the
pack, with 45 percent, followed by former Red Cross President
Elizabeth Dole (20 percent), McCain (11 percent), conservative
pundit Pat Buchanan (6 percent), Forbes (4 percent), Quayle (4
percent) and former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander (2 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Among all likely New Hampshire voters, Bush out-polled Gore 54
percent to 32 percent head to head. Gore, matched up against his
primary challenger Bradley, led 46 percent to 34 percent. The
survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   As they jockey for position in the crowded field, the candidates
must contend with a primary/caucus calendar that continues to shift
beneath them. Last week, South Carolina moved its GOP primary to
Feb. 19, putting it ahead of Arizona's Feb. 22 GOP primary.
Louisiana Republicans also voted this week to move their caucus to
one week before the Iowa caucuses, or tentatively, Jan. 29. That
would make party members in their state the first in the nation to
cast votes, ahead of those in Iowa, traditionally the first.
</P>
<P>
   As the timing of these crucial votes remains in doubt, the
intensity of the early scrimmaging has been a challenge for
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campaigns definitely have to be more creative and more
flexible in how they approach it,'' said Jonathan Baron,
communications director for Quayle. He adds that if there is a
silver lining to the front-loaded campaign season, it is that
conservative activists in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire
will take on even greater import. &QL;

   PINEHURST, N.C. _ Colin Montgomerie folded his umbrella,
positioned himself on the interview dais and smiled broadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hear that?'' Montgomerie said, as the intensity of raindrops
falling on the clubhouse roof increased tenfold during a short
stretch yesterday. ``That's the sound of greens softening. It's a
beautiful noise.''
</P>
<P>
   For the hard-luck Scot, who is convinced that putting problems
have been his biggest stumbling block in winning an elusive U.S.
Open title, the pounding rains at Pinehurst No. 2 provided sweet
music. Montgomerie, 35, has finished as the Open runner-up twice in
the past five years, including a playoff loss to Ernie Els in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, his heartbreak pales in comparison to Tom Lehman, one of
only two men to play in the final group of the final round at four
consecutive Opens. Lehman has done so each year since 1995, with no
titles to show for his efforts. Bobby Jones also played in the
final group at four consecutive Opens but won two of those, in 1929
and 1930.
</P>
<P>
   Like Montgomerie, Lehman heads into tomorrow's opening round at
Pinehurst Resort and Country Club comfortable in the knowledge he
can handle a demanding course, but haunted by the near-victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, you think about it,'' said Lehman, 40. ``You ask
yourself, `Is something missing in me? Is something missing in my
game?' I've been so close before, and this is the tournament I'd
like to win more than any other.
</P>
<P>
   ``After awhile, you realize, `I've played under a lot of heat.
I'm OK.' But sometimes you make the key putt. Sometimes, you
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Both players hope the rain-softened Pinehurst greens will help
them in this year's Open quest. Montgomerie, a two-time winner on
the European Tour this season, said a balky putter has dogged him
in more majors than the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   The worst case, he said, was the 1995 PGA Championship, when he
lost in a playoff to Steve Elkington. During the 72 holes of
regulation, Montgomerie took 17 more putts than Elkington. As a
result, Montgomerie _ star of Europe's 1997 Ryder Cup victory _ has
yet to win a tournament on U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before my career finishes, I would like to win a tournament in
the U.S. Because I've come so close in this particular event, I'd
like to take that one step farther and make this the one,''
Montgomerie said. ``I've never blamed my long game, my driving or
my iron play for not winning in this country. It's always been that
I haven't holed out as well as the winner has.''
</P>
<P>
   In Montgomerie's estimation, Pinehurst's small greens _ now
slowed by rain, and with more showers in today's forecast _ could
be just the tonic for what has ailed his short game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to talk myself into believing that, so we'll see
what happens,'' said Montgomerie, who has finished first and fifth
in his past two starts in Europe. ``I don't think you come to this
tournament and find your game. You've got to bring your game with
you, and I'm certainly confident that I've brought a good game of
golf here.''
</P>
<P>
   So has Lehman, who finished second in Monday's rain-delayed
conclusion to the FedEx St. Jude Classic in Memphis, Tenn. After
celebrating his 40th birthday on March 7, however, Lehman said he
wonders how many more chances he will have to exorcise his Open
demons.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I'm hitting my stride, I'm turning 40,'' Lehman
said. ``I wish I could have some of those years in my early 30s
over, knowing what I know now. I feel like I have three or four
good years left. I just wish it was eight or nine.''
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, Lehman hopes he will answer questions Sunday
about an Open achievement rather than another near-victory.
Montgomerie, rest assured, shares the same desire.
NEAR VICTORIES Between them, Colin Montgomerie and Tom Lehman have
eight finishes of sixth or better at the U.S. Open since 1992
without a victory. The breakdown: Finish Player Year (winner) 2nd
Montgomerie 1997 (Ernie Els) 2nd Lehman 1996 (Steve Jones) 2nd
Montgomerie 1994 (Ernie Els) 3rd Lehman 1997 (Ernie Els) 3rd Lehman
1995 (Corey Pavin) 3rd Montgomerie 1992 (Tom Kite) 5th Lehman 1998
(Lee Janzen) 6th Lehman 1992 (Tom Kite)

TOWNS ARE NERVOUSLY BECOMING AWARE OF PRESENCE OF PIPELINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When oil began flowing more than 30 years ago from the
Canadian border to the Columbia River, it passed under mostly rural
land.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Olympic Pipe Line Co. has neighbors _ a lot of them in
the Seattle area. In the communities that make up Seattle's booming
suburbs, houses and schools that have that paint-barely-dry look
flank the pipeline as it carries jet fuel, gasoline and diesel fuel
south.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, local leaders can only cringe over the
potentially dangerous coexistences.
</P>
<P>
   But not in North Bend, where town leaders are trying to keep a
pipeline out before it is even built.
</P>
<P>
   Town leaders say they have no intention of welcoming Olympic to
North Bend, a community in the foothills of the Cascade mountain
range, about 30 miles southeast of Seattle. They want the company's
pipeline kept out of town or at least confined to a corridor
running along Interstate 90.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Olympic, even as it tries to repair the damage done to its
image after the deadly explosion of its pipeline in Bellingham last
week, won't stand for being told to get out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the company have filed a petition with a regional
growth-management board, asking it to rule that North Bend's
passing of an ordinance forbidding fuel pipelines in the town runs
afoul of state law. The pipeline, Olympic lawyers have argued, is
an essential public facility that North Bend may not like but can't
keep out. Under the ordinance, passed by the North Bend City
Council on April 6, if pipelines are deemed ``essential public
facilities,'' then they would have to run along I-90 inside the
city limits but away from residential development.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic objects to North Bend's ordinance because transportation
officials don't like pipelines along interstates, said Joann
Hamick, a spokeswoman for Olympic. Such an arrangement would keep
the interstate from being expanded, she noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other problem is that this sets a bad precedent for the
entire pipeline industry,'' she said. ``We go into cities. We make
deliveries in cities. It's where the automobiles are and where the
terminals are.''
</P>
<P>
   The combination of a pipeline and residential developments has
worried safety watchdogs for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pipelines transport about 57 percent of the crude petroleum
and petroleum products moved within the United States,'' the
National Transportation Safety Board noted in a 1996 report on
pipeline safety. ``The potential threat to public safety from such
releases has become more severe in recent years, as residential and
commercial development adjacent to all types of pipelines has
accelerated.''
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB has urged regulators to make tougher rules for
pipelines in populated areas. It has recommended, for example, that
sturdier pipe be used in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   But the branch of the U.S. Transportation Department that
regulates pipelines doesn't regulate what sort of building or
development can take place near them.
</P>
<P>
   And while the state won't allow a structure to be built on a
pipeline, it doesn't try to control how close to the line a
structure can be located. Those decisions are left up to local
jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
   Many communities do little more than keep buildings out of the
rights of way.
</P>
<P>
   The sometimes tragic results can be seen in neighborhoods like
those along Whatcom Creek in Bellingham, where a leak of gasoline
from the Olympic pipeline ignited Thursday and killed a teenager
and two boys.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the houses nearby were built after the 34-year-old
pipeline had been installed.
</P>
<P>
   East of Lake Washington in King County, houses routinely rise up
along the Olympic pipeline and its right of way.
</P>
<P>
   In Renton, where fuel has been flowing since 1965, Mayor Jesse
Tanner said he would never let another pipeline in, if he could
prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   But, Tanner said, ``Frankly, there's nothing I can do about it
now. It goes through residential neighborhoods and will continue to
go through residential neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   The rupture and fire in Bellingham shows the worst that can
happen. But fires following pipeline leaks are rare, though experts
say the chances for an explosion are greater in an urban area.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're out in the desert somewhere, and there's no human
for literally miles, they will find the leak before an ignition,''
said John Wagner, a professor at Texas A&AMP;M University who teaches
safety engineering and industrial hygiene. But the odds are greater
that something will occur to ignite the leaking petroleum in an
urban area before the rupture is discovered or stopped, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The explosive power of gasoline vapor is such that a seemingly
benign electric spark created by turning on a flashlight or
cellular telephone could ignite it, Wagner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, all you need (for an explosion) is sufficient fuel
mixed with air. For gasoline, because it has a very low flash
point, that occurs at all temperatures down to minus 40 degrees
Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner has also been a consultant to groups opposed to a
pipeline that Olympic wants to build across the Cascades to Pasco.
</P>
<P>
   The cities and towns along the pipeline also worry about
something less severe than fire.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 in Renton, a small leak in the Olympic pipeline under
the Maplewood neighborhood went undetected for nine months. By the
time it was discovered, more than 80,000 gallons had leaked.
</P>
<P>
   Residue from the leak remains and probably will for years to
come, Tanner said.
</P>
<P>
   Renton has tried to make the pipeline safer, negotiating to get
enhancements when Olympic's franchise is about to expire. Recently,
for example, the city got the Renton-based company to agree to
remote-control valves that will block the flow in the event of a
leak, Tanner said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Bellingham fire, he said, Renton officials are
investigating how they can make the pipeline safer.
</P>
<P>
   In the Cascade foothills, town leaders have a different problem.
Olympic wants its proposed 231-mile pipeline from Woodinville to
Pasco to run through or near the towns.
</P>
<P>
   Their response is simple. ``We flat don't want it in our town,''
said Phil Messina, North Bend's city administrator.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline would pass just outside Carnation, through the
outskirts of Snoqualmie and by two of its schools, then through
downtown North Bend.
</P>
<P>
   In Carnation, officials worry about leaks in the Tolt River. In
Snoqualmie, it's the Snoqualmie River that causes worries, said
Mayor Fuzzy Fletcher.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline would pass within 200 feet or less of North Bend
Elementary School and Two Rivers Alternative High School, Messina
said. It would pass through downtown North Bend under an abandoned
railroad bed that has since become the Snoqualmie Valley hiking
trail.
</P>
<P>
   Hamick, the company spokeswoman, said state law requires that
pipeline companies try to run their lines in conjunction with other
utilities. In North Bend, it has proposed running its pipeline
where power lines run.
</P>
<P>
   The three towns recently sent a letter to Gov. Gary Locke, who
has the final say on the proposed pipeline, and asked him to reject
it.
</P>
<P>
   By passing its ordinance, North Bend went one step further.
</P>
<P>
   State growth-management laws say cities can't keep out such
essential facilities like airports, colleges prisons or
drug-treatment hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic has told the Central Puget Sound Growth Management
Hearings Board that its proposed pipeline fits in with those
essential facilities and that the North Bend ordinance essentially
forbids the pipeline by confining it to one location.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in North Bend have different thoughts on the matter.
``This is a private, profit-making pipeline,'' Messina said. ``It's
not a public facility.''

HUNDLEY BENCHED IN SHAKEUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Not one to sit and watch his team flounder in
frustration, manager Davey Johnson shook up the Dodgers on Tuesday
by benching catcher Todd Hundley and banishing Darren Dreifort to
the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort's spot in the rotation will be taken by rookie
right-hander Jamie Arnold, who will start Saturday against
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Angel Pena takes over the daily catching duties. Hundley
will serve as a pinch-hitter and spell Pena while working his sore
throwing elbow into shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the right thing to do,'' Hundley said. ``The best
thing is to step back and get back to basics, good mechanics, get
my arm back in shape. It's muscle memory. It's doing it over and
over and over again. I think, subconsciously, my brain is trying to
protect my elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mechanically, it's been brutal. You have to deal with reality.
I haven't been myself defensively. I have to get my arm in catching
shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the team considered placing Hundley on the disabled
list. Hundley, recovering from reconstructive elbow surgery in
September of 1997, said he wanted to remain with the club. He said
he's treating the situation like a mini-spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still some soreness in the elbow we've been
fighting,'' Hundley said. ``It's not tendon or ligament soreness.
It's muscle soreness, which is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley has lived up to his reputation for being an hard worker,
but it hasn't translated into better defense. He missed most of
spring training working, and hasn't caught up.
</P>
<P>
   The catching situation hit bottom Sunday against Oakland when
Hundley threw wildly to first base after a wild pitch on a third
strike. Hundley's ninth error allowed two runs to score. Also,
runners have stolen 53 bases in 60 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Hundley developed the longer throwing motion when
he tried to play outfield for the Mets last season. To remedy it,
Hundley will work with bullpen catcher Rick Dempsey. The two spent
nearly an hour before Tuesday's game working on mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to do Camp Dempsey,'' Johnson said. ``He's in
rehab for me. I'll keep him here and I can still use his bat.
Hopefully, it'll give him time to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley, who's making $5.3 million this season, was acquired in
a deal that sent Gold Glove catcher Charles Johnson to the Mets
(who traded him to Baltimore). He was supposed to supply power from
the left side, but he's hitting a combined .248 with seven homers
and 18 RBI as a lefty. Pena, 24, is hitting .237 with three RBI in
12 games.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Johnson elected to send the control-plagued Dreifort
to the bullpen instead of lefty Carlos Perez because he thinks
Dreifort can help more there.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort, who declined to talk speak with reporters, and Perez
both have been terrible of late. Perez is 2-8 with a 7.18 ERA and
lasted just 21/3 innings in his last start. Dreifort, a former
reliever, is 5-5 with a 6.42 ERA but is averaging slightly more
than five innings a start.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson talked about using Dreifort out of the bullpen in the
spring, but was advised against it. Dreifort had reconstructive
elbow surgery in 1995, and team physicians feared his arm wouldn't
respond to pitching in relief. Johnson said he talked to the
Dodgers medical staff, which gave the move the OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``He screams out to me, `Late-innings guy,' and I can't get to
him there as a starter,'' Johnson said. ``I know this will help my
bullpen. I don't abuse my pitchers. It's easier for him with work
out of the pen than it is to start, and if not, I'll reverse it.
He's got a valuable arm and I want to use it. I don't see where
Perez can do that much for me in the pen. Dreifort can. Carlos has
to do it starting.''

COWBOYS RELEASE SUALUA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Clarence E. Hill Jr. and Jeff Caplan 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys released fullback Nicky Sualua
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Sualua has received a lot of negative attention since the death
of former tackle Mark Tuinei last month. Sualua, a two-year
veteran, was with Tuinei the night when the tackle died after using
heroin and designer drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jerry Jones said, however, that the little-used fullback
was released because of ``football considerations'' only. The
Cowboys say they'll save $231,000 against the salary cap by
releasing Sualua.
Minicamp opens
</P>
<P>
   The first day of minicamp finished far less dramatic than it
began when Michael Irvin failed to show for the morning session of
two-a-days. With Irvin back in the fold in the afternoon, it was a
typically hot day of workouts that kicked off the drive to the July
26 opening of training camp in Wichita Falls.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day, six-practice minicamp continues today and
tomorrow at the Cowboys' Valley Ranch practice facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went a lot better than the one last year, that's for sure,
but it wasn't where I hoped to be,'' coach Chan Gailey said. ``This
is just a glimpse of what it's going to be like in training camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sessions concentrated on conditioning as well as offensive,
defensive and special-teams drills. Gailey said he was most
impressed with the ``way the defense moved around'' and a ``solid
day of work from the kicking game.''
Sanders ready for new deal
</P>
<P>
   Injured cornerback Deion Sanders said he was pleased to hear
that Jones has decided to work on signing him to a contract
extension.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, expected to be sidelined four to six months after toe
surgery April 27, said he's confident that a deal can be worked
out.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, 31, is scheduled to earn $6.5 million next season. The
Cowboys want to restructure his contract to free up money to sign
their rookie draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   Any extension would probably be a multiyear deal that gives
Sanders a larger signing bonus and lower base salary, which would
clear salary-cap room for the Cowboys and give Sanders the security
of finishing his career with the team.

POSTPONEMENT AT CWS GIVES RICE MANAGER OPTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. _ Heavy rains moved in Tuesday and shoved the
College World Series schedule back 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's schedule, Rice (59-14) against Alabama (52-15) at 2:30
p.m. and Cal State Fullerton (50-13) against Florida State (54-13)
at 6:30, has been rescheduled for Wednesday, weather permitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only thing I don't like about baseball, being
subject to the effects of weather,'' Owls coach Wayne Graham said.
``But maybe that's part of its charm.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, this is the first time in 74 games this year that
the Owls have had weather problems.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rice could now pitch Mario Ramos (13-2) with four days'
rest against Alabama, Graham said he is ``leaning toward'' Jeff
Nichols (15-4), who has worked three innings in two relief
appearances. A third possibility would be Marc Gwyn (7-1), who
pitched two-thirds of an inning Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The single games scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday will now
be compacted into a doubleheader tomorrow, with the Rice-Alabama
winner facing Miami at 2:30 p.m. and the Fullerton-Florida State
winner meeting Stanford at 7:30 p.m. RICE RECAP
</P>
<P>
   Watching the steady drizzle fall out of a cold, gloomy sky
Tuesday, Rice athletic director Bobby May reflected on the state of
the Owls at this juncture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a great year,'' he said. ``We have more wins (59)
than we've ever had, and we won another regional, which was great.
Then we got to host the Super Regional in the Astrodome, which was
a first, and a lot of fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're back here for the second time, and we finally got
our first win up here, beating Oklahoma State. We need more wins
like that. It was a big hump, and we're over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, if we can just play well ... every day ... there's a
chance. That would really be something, if we made it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never won a national championship _ in anything.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Owls, who lost their opening game, can come back and win
it all, they will join a select group. It's only happened twice,
but the most recent occasion was last year, when Southern Cal lost
its opener and then reeled off five consecutive wins.
</P>
<P>
   The only other teams to accomplish the feat were Arizona in 1980
and Cal State Fullerton in '79.
</P>
<P>
   May, however, is willing to make any sacrifice to make it
happen. Asked why, on a chilly day, he was attired in slacks,
moccasins and no socks, he smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I wore last night,'' he said, ``when we won.''
SHUTOUTS SHUT OUT
</P>
<P>
   Although no one is expecting a repeat of last year's 21-14 title
game, neither is there any great expectation of a goose egg war.
</P>
<P>
   The last shutout game in CWS play was in 1995, when Cal State
Fullerton beat Tennessee, 11-0.
</P>
<P>
   The last complete-game shutout was pitched by Georgia Tech's
Brad Rigby, who blanked Fullerton, 2-0, in 1994. nn

INTERNET BOOTING UP AS POLITICAL TOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet has arrived on the national political scene. Every
serious presidential candidate has a Web site. Volunteers are being
organized by e-mail. Money is being raised in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Vice President Al Gore will announce his candidacy
for president with a so-called cybercast _ a broadcast carried on
the Internet and viewed on personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the Internet will play a bigger role in 2000 than
ever before, as candidates learn how to make the electronic
universe work for them. But it isn't going to transform American
politics overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the Internet going to have the impact that television did
in 1960?'' asked David Haase, an expert on politics on the
Internet. ``Almost certainly not.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, a televised debate between Richard Nixon and John F.
Kennedy changed American politics forever. Under the harsh TV
lights, Nixon's 5 o'clock shadow turned off voters, while Kennedy
looked young and vibrant.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet won't hold that kind of sway until it becomes as
pervasive as television or the telephone, experts say. Right now,
40 percent of the population doesn't have Internet access, and many
others are using old technology that makes Web surfing slow and
clunky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not there yet,'' said Rob Kubasko, an ASU Web site
designer who helped build Bob Dole's campaign site in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now is definitely the time to innovate, and now is the
time to pioneer. . . . Just like when Kennedy and Nixon got on TV
for the first time, it took candidates a while to understand (the
medium.)''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is becoming an effective fund-raising tool, because
it allows contributors to give by using credit cards. The practice
got a boost last week when the Federal Election Commission made
such donations eligible for federal matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet also allows candidates to communicate directly with
voters with an unfiltered message.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will be able to get informed where they want it and
when they want it,'' said Bill Lewis, vice provost for information
technology at ASU, ``instead of having to wait until it comes on
TV, or they go to a forum or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said good Web sites will help a candidate, and bad ones
can damage them.
</P>
<P>
   As a success story, some point to Republican Pat Buchanan's Web
site (www.gopatgo2000.org), which isn't fancy but stays on message
and works to rally the troops.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the spectrum is Republican John Kasich's
site, a collection of snapshots that includes a complete bio of the
family pet, a springer spaniel named Penny Bird. Making matters
worse, Kasich selected a domain name similar to a looming computer
worry (www. k2k.org).
</P>
<P>
   Other sites run the gamut. Democrat Bill Bradley
(www.billbradley. com) includes a long biography with pictures of
his basketball days with the U.S. Olympic team and the New York
Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush has sparred with the creator of a
parody site (www.gwbush.com), which bears a striking resemblance to
the Republican's real site (www. georgewbush.com).
</P>
<P>
   The parody site plans to sell T-shirts emblazoned with Bush's
now-celebrated quote about the site: ``There ought to be limits to
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle's site (www.quayle.org) focuses
on political philosophy, saying Quayle wants to ``resurrect Ronald
Reagan's vision of government that will `stand by our side, not
ride on our back.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole's site (www. edole2000.org) trumpets Dole's
appearance on Rosie O'Donnell's show and her ``virtual college
commencement speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his claim of inventing the Internet, Vice President Al
Gore's site (www.algore2000.com) is relatively plain. One feature
is the text of Gore's Graceland College commencement speech last
month. There is also a Gore parody site (www.allgore.com).
</P>
<P>
   Republican John McCain's site (www.mccain2000.com) includes
video footage of McCain as a child and as a Navy pilot captured by
the North Vietnamese. But people with slow modems and old software
won't be able to view it, Haase said.
</P>
<P>
   Web designer Kubasko said some campaigns are mistakenly filling
their sites with staggering amounts of useless information instead
of supplying simple, strong messages about candidates and their
views.
</P>
<P>
   Kubasko noted that Steve Forbes has spent nearly $1.5 million on
his site (www.forbes2000.com), which is very busy and full of
gimmicks like his ``e-Precinct,'' a club to basically to help
Forbes gather e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   While Web pages are neat _ every serious candidate has one _
e-mail and discussion groups are much more critical to candidates,
said Haase, who until recently wrote a syndicated column called
``Plugged-In Politics.''
</P>
<P>
   With e-mail, candidates can contact supporters and potential
volunteers virtually for free, instead of spending critical
campaign funds on postage. By using discussion groups, candidates
can tap into issues and hear from voters.
</P>
<P>
   One Internet success story is Jesse Ventura, the former
professional wrestler elected governor of Minnesota, who used
e-mail masterfully in the final days of his campaign while he
zigzagged across the state last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were literally organizing events and trying to round up
turnout two towns away. . . . They were (sending e-mail), saying,
`Hey we're 15 miles away,' '' Haase said.
</P>
<P>
   For the political junkie, there are plenty of sites that dig as
deep into politics as anyone would want to go.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the better clearinghouse sites, where people can find
links to almost every political site, include Politics1
(www.politics1.com/p2000. htm), Political Junkie (www.
politicaljunkie.com) and White House 2000 (www.niu.edu/
newsplace/whitehouse.html).
</P>
<P>
   For hard-core political analysis, including campaign finance and
candidate profiles, people can try Project Vote Smart
(www.vote-smart.org/ce), FECInfo (www.tray. com/fecinfo) or the
Center for Responsive Politics (www.
opensecrets.org/home/index.asp).
</P>
<P>
   And for dirty laundry on the candidates, as well as some links
to humor sites, try the Skeleton Closet (www.realchange.org).
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the Internet's impact, people ultimately will be better
informed, Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be able to allow a larger percentage of
the electorate to be an educated electorate,'' Lewis said. &QL;

BAD DAY FOR DODGERS, BROWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Remember Sunday in Oakland, when it couldn't get
worse for the Dodgers?
</P>
<P>
   It got worse. Much worse. The man who's been the steadying force
through the mayhem did the Dodgers starters' strut, not lasting
very long.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown had one of the worst outings of his career, allowing
eight runs in three innings as the Pittsburgh Pirates blasted the
Dodgers 11-1 Tuesday at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers (29-33) have lost four straight, 10 of 13 and all
four they've played against the financially challenged Pirates this
season. Pittsburgh hit five homers, three of which came off Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's 9-3 fiasco came after a team meeting. Tuesday's
browbeating came on the heels of the Dodgers' making a minor trade
to acquire Craig Counsell and manager Davey Johnson announcing Todd
Hundley was being benched and Darren Dreifort sent to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   And Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone, returning from Vero
Beach, Fla., walked into the ballpark just in time to see first
baseman Eric Karros throw wildly to home in a failed attempt to
nail Al Martin at the plate in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for the fans,'' Malone said. ``It's discouraging,
it's upsetting, it's frustrating. When you look at the talent we
have and don't see a performance that equates to the talent, it's
puzzling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to figure out how to get out of this rut. Players have
to figure out what they can do to get this thing going. We're here
to support them. If we have the talent, and it's comparable to that
of other baseball clubs, why aren't we performing? This is
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``This hurts. This hurts us a lot. (From) the president (Bob
Graziano) to myself to Bill Geivett (assistant to the general
manager) to the manager and the coaches, this is painful.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Brown (7-4) was supposed to provide a reprieve. He
was 5-1 after Dodgers' losses and stopped three-game losing streaks
in his last two starts.
</P>
<P>
   But two pitches into the game you could tell this wasn't his
night. Brown's first pitch was hit by Martin for a double. His
second one was hit out of the ballpark by Ed Sprague as the Pirates
took a 2-0 lead. Kevin Young hit a solo homer two batters later to
make it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   It got worse in the second when Brown walked Martin with one out
and Sprague singled. Brian Giles then grounded to Karros, who threw
the ball to the left and out of catcher Angel Pena's reach to allow
Martin to score and put runners on second and third.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Brown committed the gaffe. Jason Kendall hit a
comebacker, but instead of checking the runner at third Brown
apparently lost track of the number of outs and flipped the ball to
first for the second out. Sprague scored and Brown, realizing his
mistake, hunched over behind the mound. Warren Morris added an
RBI-single to give the Pirates a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Martin then hit a two-out homer in the third inning, the third
homer Brown allowed. After yielding eight homers with the San Diego
Padres last season, Brown has given up 12 this season. In three
innings he allowed eight runs (four earned) on eight hits.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd grew so restless with the Dodgers that it mockingly
gave a standing ovation when Pirates starter Todd Ritchie (6-4)
wild pitched Devon White home in the seventh for the Dodgers' only
run.
</P>
<P>
   Brant Brown and Kendall also homered for the Pirates.

JACKSON MAY BE SORRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If Hollywood had been smart, it would have beaten
Jerry Buss to the bank vault and offered Phil Jackson the moon, his
own star on the Walk of Fame and whatever else it took so he'd do
its bidding in the hallowed halls of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's lobbying for the Lakers' head coaching job was
cunning. It was so politically artful it was easy to turn a blind
eye to the carnage.
</P>
<P>
   The machinations that have married Jackson to the Lakers _ the
formal ceremony is today, at the Beverly Hilton _ weren't set into
motion last week when the courting began in earnest or even last
month when the Lakers were swept out of the postseason for the
second consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have been in Jackson's crosshairs for more than a
year. Buss' luxury liner was sailing along pretty smoothly under
Del Harris' command in the spring of 1998 when Jackson _ who was
well on his way to a sixth NBA championship title as coach of the
Chicago Bulls _ gently rocked the boat.
</P>
<P>
   He told a magazine reporter he had watched Lakers center
Shaquille O'Neal commit a foul wholly out of anger in a home loss
to Phoenix and then snap at Harris on the bench when the coach
tried to explain to the petulant O'Neal the error of his ways.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it doesn't take a Zen master to recognize that no official
can unnerve O'Neal unless he allows it. Alas, after seven seasons
in the NBA, O'Neal seems to be the last to figure it out.
</P>
<P>
   As he watched O'Neal unravel that night, Jackson was quoted as
saying, ``It didn't frighten me, but it was a warning signal: Is
this kid smart enough yet to know what he can and can't do in this
game to become a winner? I see that as a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes time, running off two coaches, but all these months
later the challenge finally is his. Be careful what you wish for,
is all we have to say.
</P>
<P>
   If Jackson thought the Bulls front office was a load, just wait
until he sees Tex Winter's triple-post offense become the Bermuda
Triangle in O'Neal's needy hands. Remember, in the Spurs' four-game
sweep of the Lakers in the Western Division semifinals, O'Neal had
two assists.
</P>
<P>
   In O'Neal, we're talking about a player who thinks a varied
offense means he dunks one time down the court, flips in a hook on
the next possession and makes a baby jumper after that.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what he says, his game doesn't lie. To watch O'Neal
hold onto defensive rebounds under the basket so the fast break
can't go on without him, or force a shot rather than kick the ball
out to the perimeter, is to understand that in his mind, his
teammates exist to make him better.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven help Jackson in getting it through O'Neal's stubborn
skull that it has to be the other way around if the Lakers are
going to be anything but also-rans.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal has yet to prove himself smart enough to do the little
things it takes to become a winner _ such as sink free throws with
any consistency and play defense with any compulsion. Too bad the
7-foot-1 center exerts his will more forcefully off the court than
on it.
</P>
<P>
   It was O'Neal who hastened Harris' departure by tuning him out,
and he turned on Harris' replacement, Kurt Rambis, so fast Rambis'
head must have been spinning like a basketball (it does seem O'Neal
is collecting coaches' heads these days).
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal championed the pursuit of Jackson as he did the promotion
of Rambis. It could be a short honeymoon, unless O'Neal looks long
and hard enough in the mirror to recognize that his game has warts.
</P>
<P>
   No matter who's barking orders from the sideline, it'll be the
same old Lakers that haven't advanced to the finals since 1991 as
long as O'Neal blames the head coach and/or his teammates for the
team's failings.
</P>
<P>
   Until he can sink seven free throws out of 10 without blinking;
until he becomes a student of defense; until he has the good sense
not to pose with a rap star for the cover of a sports magazine; as
long as his name graces more albums than NBA title rosters, O'Neal
shouldn't even think about passing the buck.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Jackson will be able to hold O'Neal's attention for more
than two minutes. O'Neal and Jackson aren't so different, when it
comes right down to it. They are different sides of the same
hubris.
</P>
<P>
   For all his talk about winning NBA titles, O'Neal showed this
season that as long as he gets his 30 points and 10 rebounds, he
can live with himself (Harris, Rambis, Eddie Jones and Elden
Campbell, on the other hand, had to go).
</P>
<P>
   And for all his metaphysical musings and spiritual wanderings,
Jackson has demonstrated recently that he is very much a child of
the corporal world. Nobody but a true egocentric would have been
caught dead dining with Knicks president Dave Checketts as long as
Jeff Van Gundy was ensconced at the end of the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson apparently forgot how miffed he was when he found out
the Bulls had interviewed Tim Floyd for Jackson's job even as he
was doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Oh well. It'll help having a short memory when coaching the
Lakers. Better to forget the way things were in L.A. in the '80s,
or in Chicago in the '90s, than to have them as a constant reminder
of the way things aren't. &QL;

DEFENDANT TO TAKE STAND IN SLEEPWALKING TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Scott Falater, the electronics engineer who says he
was sleepwalking when he stabbed his wife 44 times, will take the
witness stand Wednesday in a high-risk effort to persuade a
Maricopa County Superior Court jury that he is innocent of
premeditated murder.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Michael Kimerer confirmed Tuesday that he would
call Falater to bolster a defense that has effectively assumed the
burden of disproving the prosecution's charge.
</P>
<P>
   Kimerer declined to elaborate, but before the trial he spoke
about the importance of testimony from a defendant who offers such
an unusual defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a case like this, the jury wants to hear from the
defendant, to evaluate what he says and to judge him as a man,''
Kimerer said. Falater's testimony, first with his own attorneys and
then with combative prosecutor Juan Martinez, will likely climax a
trial that has already heard from relatives, friends and colleagues
at Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   They testified that Falater's bloody violence in 1997 seemed to
come from nowhere, contradicting everything they knew about a
devout Mormon who was known for kindness and decency. Several
described Falater as a harmless ``nerd.''
</P>
<P>
   Other key defense witnesses were two renowned sleep disorders
experts, including one who said Tuesday that she believed so
strongly in Falater's case that she was helping the defense for
free.
</P>
<P>
   To support their opinions that Falater was sleepwalking, the
experts cited his history of childhood sleepwalking, sophisticated
hospital sleep studies, and what they called the bizarre, illogical
nature of his behavior that night.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's expert was Rosalind Cartwright, director of a Chicago
sleep disorder center, who said she has studied hundreds of cases
of sleepwalking violence.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how Falater's case compared to the others, she responded,
``I believe he's the purest case I've seen with an act of violence
of this kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the jury will have its chance to take the measure of
Falater, 43, who is hoping to establish reasonable doubt about the
prosecution's claim that he knowingly and deliberately attacked his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   Falater claims to have no memory of the attack, which his
attorneys say occurred during a sleepwalking episode that lasted 45
to 50 minutes. He is expected to talk at length about his 20-year
marriage to Yarmila, who was his high school sweetheart and the
mother of his two children.
</P>
<P>
   Both children, 17-year-old Megan and 15-year-old Michael,
testified that their parents had a loving, harmonious marriage that
had never before been marred by violence.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, however, has suggested that the Falater marriage was
under severe strain. Under his questioning, several defense
witnesses acknowledged that Yarmila sometimes complained about the
demands of the Mormon Church, where Scott was an enthusiastic
member.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez will present most of his case with rebuttal witnesses,
who will take the stand after Falater. The assistant county
attorney has lined up his own sleep experts, as well as some
witnesses who are expected to testify about signs of trouble in the
Falater marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez on Tuesday sparred with Cartwright, especially about
her testimony that she needed ``eyeball to eyeball contact'' to
determine if a subject had been sleepwalking at the time of a
violent act.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to be confident that this is someone who is not
pulling the wool over your eyes, is not a liar or con man or making
up a story,'' Cartwright told Kimerer. She said she had concluded
that Falater ``was not malingering.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez launched his cross-examination by showing the jury a
report Cartwright submitted before she met Falater. ``I think he
suffered from a sleep disorder, and I would be willing to render
this opinion under oath,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   With that evidence, Martinez dramatized a persistent theme in
his questioning of defense witnesses: that they jumped too quickly
to a conclusion and had been conned by a manipulative murderer.
</P>
<P>
   In his earlier questioning of Cartwright, Kimerer sought to
present her as a conscientious citizen-scientist who had come
forward to assist a man she believed had been wrongly accused.
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright, a psychologist, said if she decides that a
sleepwalking defense is valid she has a ``duty as a citizen to help
that person any way I can.'' She said she has two principal
motivations: to help the sleepwalker and to educate the public
about sleepwalking violence.
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright acknowledged a third motivation, which was both
professional and personal. ``Each case teaches us something,'' she
said. ``It's a privilege to work with these people and learn from
them.'' &QL;

DODGERS TRADE FOR COUNSELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The acquisition of second baseman Craig Counsell
from the Florida Marlins may be a small move in trying to cure
what's wrong with the Dodgers, but it is symbolic in why it was
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a baseball player,'' said Dodgers general manager Kevin
Malone, pointing out that's different than a guy who plays
baseball. ``We need baseball players, guys that are hard-nosed,
execute the fundamentals, play the game. He's a good fit for us. A
left-handed hitter, knows how to play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers traded for Counsell, who scored the winning run in
Game 7 of the 1997 World Series, for a player to be named later on
Tuesday. Counsell was used as a pinch-hitter against Pittsburgh at
Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Malone said they did it for depth in the infield and to give the
Dodgers the option of using another left-handed bat against tough
right-handers.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the limited level of talent we have at the minor-league
level, we do what we can do to get better,'' Malone said. ``Craig
Counsell makes us a little bit better.''
</P>
<P>
   Counsell was eager to get to Los Angeles. He asked the Marlins
to be traded after he lost his starting second base job to Luis
Castillo. Counsell was particularly upset after he was the victim
of a defensive replacement when the Marlins were leading a game
3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said he could use Counsell as a
defensive replacement late in games, and to rest the Young at
second.
</P>
<P>
   Young has been hampered injuries for much of the last month.
Counsell, 28, was hitting .152 in 37 games for the Marlins before
being designated for assignment Friday. He's a lifetime .253 hitter
with a .990 fielding percentage. Counsell makes $245,000 this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to have (Young) out there when he has a broken
ankle or he was out of gas,'' Johnson said. ``He was a perfect
fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said the move wasn't a precursor to trading any of the
middle infielders _ Young, Jose Vizcaino or injured Mark
Grudzielanek. However, he did say Counsell had the capability to
play every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the right spot, on the right club, he's an everyday
player,'' Malone said. ``At this point in time, he's a quality
extra infielder.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a reunion for Counsell, who was greeted by former
Marlins teammate Kevin Brown in the clubhouse. Gary Sheffield and
Devon White also played with Counsell in Florida and Eric Young and
outfielder Trenidad Hubbard know him from their Colorado Rockies
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I wasn't getting an opportunity (in Florida) and I
asked to be traded,'' Counsell said. ``It wasn't a good situation
for both of us. But this is a team (the Dodgers) that has a chance
to win, or should win. I've won a World Series and there's nothing
like it.''
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Counsell, the Dodgers designated outfielder
Brent Cookson, a former Ventura College and Long Beach State star,
for assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalk: Pitching coach Claude Osteen left the
team for a few days to attend the funeral of his mother in
Nashville, Tenn. Dodgers minor-league pitching coordinator Jim
Benedict is filling in.... Right-handed reliever Antonio Osuna
tossed a baseball Friday and remains on target for a late July
return.... Grudzielanek had the cast removed from his broken right
wrist Monday and is wearing a splint. He's still at least a week
away from beginning any type of rehab work.

A BIG, BLUE MESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a news flash for the fine people at Fox regarding their
baseball team, the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   It really sucks.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so that isn't exactly news.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also boring.
</P>
<P>
   Now that should get the attention of the men running Dodger
blue. They are, after all, in the entertainment business. The
purchase of the Dodgers had as much to do with TV sports
programming as it did baseball. If the Dodgers were a TV show, they
would have been cancelled last season.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the feeble 25-man congregation for 1999 is slow-walking
through the requirements of a 162 game season, playing comatose
baseball with nary a single reason for fan interest or affection.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Raul Mondesi has his faithful fans, there's a smattering of
appreciation for The Last Dodger, Eric Karros, and we all may grow
to like that smirk on Kevin Brown's face.
</P>
<P>
   But everywhere else, the Dodgers are apathy personified, as
demonstrative as a shrug. There may be some nice fellows here and
there, but as Shania Twain puts it, that doesn't keep us warm in
the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Who knew the chemistry-failing, post-season wailing Dodgers of
the mid-'90s would be the good old days? As derelict as some of
those teams were, there was some success (two division titles and a
record 44 games over .500 between 1995-97) and always a reason for
optimism.
</P>
<P>
   I can trace this problem to its source. It all began last year
when Fox put a buzz saw to the family tree and started throwing
money at problems like it was fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   When Fox officially purchased the team in spring training of
1998, new execs Chase Carey and Peter Chernin pointed at the World
Series champs, the New York Yankees, as a model for baseball
success. The Yanks were willing to take risks and spend money to
solve problems.
</P>
<P>
   That's all fine and good -- if you make the right decisions on
where to throw the money. The Yankees have won two World Series in
the last three years, but they also went from 1982 to 1992 without
a single division title or postseason game.
</P>
<P>
   During that span, the Yankees threw money at every free agent or
well-shopped veteran there was, hoping to find the right
combination. But for every intriguing pick up like Rickey Henderson
or Don Baylor, there were three or four bobbles -- like Steve Kemp,
Toby Harrah, Omar Moreno, Phil Niekro, Joe Niekro, Rick Rhoden, Ron
Kittle, Claudell Washington, Don Slaught, Jack Clark, John
Candelaria, Steve Sax, Jesse Barfield, Roberto Kelly, Dave
Lapointe, Steve Balboni and Mike Witt.
</P>
<P>
   This turnstile approach to solving problems has an effect beyond
adding thirty-somethings to the major league roster. On a list of
club priorities, it moves major league scouting ahead of minor
league scouting development. It can wither a farm system as
prospects either get traded or die on the vine.
</P>
<P>
   By the late '80s, the Yankees had few if any pitching prospects
in their system. One simple arc of Yankee ``aces'' says it all: The
Yanks' No. 1 starters from 1988 to 1992 were John Candelaria
(1988), someone named Andy Hawkins (1989), someone else named Lee
Guetterman (1990), Scott Sanderson (1991) and Melido Perez (1992).
</P>
<P>
   Plus, when you look at the Yankees of today, you take more
notice of home-growns Derek Jeter, Bernie Williams and Mariano
Rivera, and the way Joe Torre massages his lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Malone isn't much of masseuse. After working with crumbs
for years in Montreal, he is acting now like he won the lottery.
But all of his moves are on par with those the Foxes made early
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield? Fine player, but he shirks the limelight. If you
were going to pay any recalcitrant player $10 million a year, it
should have been someone the fans liked, like Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bonilla? Thankfully, he is now someone else's problem. But
the Dodgers had to take him as Sheffield's chaperon, which cost the
club Todd Zeile. And to get the Mets to take him in the
Charles-Johnson-Todd Hundley deal, the Dodgers had to take Mel
Rojas, who has since been sent to Detroit with Dave Mlicki for
fodder -- meaning, the Dodgers lost Zeile and got bupkis in return.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hundley? The Dodgers turned one gaffe into two by trading
Charles Johnson, a good defensive catcher with some power and
staunch clubhouse status, for a catcher who was never very good
defensively, was coming off elbow surgery, and had just one pop-up
season as a hitter in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Grudzielanek? Bad defense, impatient hitter and so smart
that he broke his hand slugging a wall. Plus, did the Dodgers need
another major league shortstop with Jose Vizcaino on the roster?
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Perez? He was 29-31 before coming to L.A., and his
reputation as a flake was confirmed before his arrival, and before
he was given a new contract, and before he blew apart this season.
</P>
<P>
   Here's your bottom line: If fans were given the chance to pick
the players they want from the repository of the last eight years,
they might keep only three everyday players -- Karros, Mondesi and
Eric Young.
</P>
<P>
   They might ask for Piazza back, or at least Johnson. They might
want veteran Zeile at third ahead of youngster Adrian Beltre. They
may question why the Dodgers gave up on Henry Rodriguez and Roger
Cedeno. They might even admit they were too hard on Jose Offerman.
And don't even get them started on the legacy of the Fred Claire
era, Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Malone's next deal will be a good one. But change for
change's sake isn't the safest or surest way to win the loyalty of
fans who were already a bit restless. The Dodgers may not have been
a great team before Fox and Malone rolled into town, but at least
they were familiar.

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Presidential Campaign 2000 kicked off in
earnest this week, looking like a rush to judgment. Even veterans
of New Hampshire's always-hectic first-in-the-nation primary seemed
put off by the early stampede of candidates through this city of
70,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early, if you ask me,'' said David Woodcock, 48, a
retired U.S. Navy petty officer, as he sat with friends in front of
Lala's Hungarian Pastry in downtown Manchester. ``This all could
have waited until next year.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the candidates, next year will be too late. Here in New
Hampshire, Republicans flocked feverishly to back Texas Gov. George
W. Bush. Elsewhere in the nation, states scrambled for early spots
in the primary process, worried that the race could be over by late
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the two front-runners took their initial steps: Bush,
the top Republican contestant, waded into Iowa and New Hampshire
for the first time and Vice President Al Gore, the leading
Democrat, prepared to announce his candidacy in Tennessee
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, Bush will make his first foray into
California, where he will hit cities with heavy Hispanic
populations to trumpet his credentials as a coalition-building
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   He already has made his mark as a fund raiser, having officially
attracted $7.6 million, more than three times the amount pulled in
by his nearest rival in the money sweepstakes, former Vice
President Dan Quayle, who took in $2.1 million in the first quarter
of the campaign cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Other GOP candidates, who have been courting voters in the early
primary states for months now, have struggled to raise cash and to
make their voices heard amid the din surrounding Bush.
</P>
<P>
   University of Virginia political science Professor Larry Sabato
said the frenzy has been pumped up by huge sums gushing into
certain campaigns and the front-loading of the primary and caucus
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no room for second thoughts, for buyer's remorse,''
Sabato said. ``If you were in a loony bin and were designing a
process for presidential selection, this is the process you would
put together.''
</P>
<P>
   And most of the candidates show no signs of reining in their
efforts. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., spent much of the week in
Senate business but still found time for a couple of campaign
speeches in Chicago and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In major campaign action:
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Gore will officially kick off his campaign for
president in his hometown, Carthage, Tenn., marking the start of
his faceoff with challenger Bill Bradley, a former senator from New
Jersey. Bradley is campaigning in California in an attempt to spark
support for his upstart bid.
</P>
<P>
   Publishing magnate Steve Forbes will add to his already bulging
campaign till Wednesday with a Wall Street fund-raiser expected to
bring in $1.1 million. The dinner will be broadcast live over the
Internet on Forbes' Web site and will be preceded by an ``Internet
reception'' during which the candidate will take questions.
</P>
<P>
   But nowhere was the action as intense as in New Hampshire. Mary
Sysyn, an alderman from Manchester, said the pace of campaigning
has been picking up in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's par for the course, but it didn't used to heat up
this early,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Forbes will travel to New Hampshire to christen his
local campaign headquarters. Quayle will make a campaign stop in
New Hampshire Wednesday to attempt to bolster his position in this
state, which he views as critical to his presidential fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   In only his second day of campaigning in New Hampshire, Bush was
clearly causing a stir with voters, who turned out in respectable
numbers to meet the candidate during his tour through Derry on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Bush made stops in New Castle, Bow, Goffstown and
Manchester, finally showing his hand on several issues, answering
at least some of the recent criticism that he was seeking to become
the party's standard bearer without exposing his views to the
sometimes searing scrutiny of his competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told New Hampshire residents that he would not subject
Supreme Court nominees to an abortion litmus test, and made it
clear during campaign stops that he would ``make my stand'' on
moderate Republican ground.
</P>
<P>
   Standing outside the Merrimack Restaurant in downtown
Manchester, pharmacist John Karas speculated that the Bush push was
designed to end-run the regular campaign process and anoint Bush
without a real fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a united front by the Republicans to get one
candidate out early,'' Karas said. ``Maybe it's a little too
early.''
</P>
<P>
   A poll taken a week ago by the ``Boston Herald'' demonstrated
how much territory Bush's rivals for the GOP nomination must cover.
</P>
<P>
   Likely New Hampshire Republican voters favored Bush. He led the
pack, with 45 percent, followed by former Red Cross President
Elizabeth Dole (20 percent), McCain (11 percent), conservative
pundit Pat Buchanan (6 percent), Forbes (4 percent), Quayle (4
percent) and former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander (2 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Among all likely New Hampshire voters, Bush out-polled Gore 54
percent to 32 percent head to head. Gore, matched up against his
primary challenger Bradley, led 46 percent to 34 percent. The
survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   As they jockey for position in the crowded field, the candidates
must contend with a primary/caucus calendar that continues to shift
beneath them. Last week, South Carolina moved its GOP primary to
Feb. 19, putting it ahead of Arizona's Feb. 22 GOP primary.
Louisiana Republicans also voted this week to move their caucus to
one week before the Iowa caucuses, or tentatively, Jan. 29. That
would make party members in their state the first in the nation to
cast votes, ahead of those in Iowa, traditionally the first.
</P>
<P>
   As the timing of these crucial votes remains in doubt, the
intensity of the early scrimmaging has been a challenge for
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campaigns definitely have to be more creative and more
flexible in how they approach it,'' said Jonathan Baron,
communications director for Quayle. He adds that if there is a
silver lining to the front-loaded campaign season, it is that
conservative activists in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire
will take on even greater import. &QL;

BAD NIGHT FOR DODGERS, BROWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Dodgers' gloomy season was supposed to have
plummeted to the bottom in Sunday's six-run loss to Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Oops.
</P>
<P>
   It got worse. Much, much worse. The man who has been the
steadying force through the mayhem did the Dodgers' starters strut.
</P>
<P>
   And Kevin Brown was battered for eight runs in three innings as
the Pittsburgh Pirates blasted the Dodgers 11-1 Tuesday night at
Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Brown give up three homers, he also was beaten to
the base on a grounder to first and then gaffed when he forget
there was only one out on a grounder hit back to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crappy pitching, crappy breaks, crappy all the way around,''
Brown said of his 69-pitch performance. ``It's the only subtle word
I can use for it. I can't explain it. I pitched like crap. A bad
situation all the way around. I never let a guy beat me to first
base. Just brain dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought there were two outs on the one play. I was so caught
up in trying to get out of the inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Four of the runs Brown (7-4) allowed were earned. He gave up
eight hits and walked two in his shortest outing since being
ejected April 21, 1998, with the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   The browbeating came on the heels of another shakeup. The
Dodgers acquired Craig Counsell in a trade, and manager Davey
Johnson announced catcher Todd Hundley was being benched and Darren
Dreifort sent to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   And after the debacle, Johnson held the clubhouse closed for 20
minutes to meet. The Dodgers held a closed-door meeting before a
9-3 loss to Oakland on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers (29-33) have lost four straight, seven of eight, 10
of 13 and all four they've played against the financially
challenged Pirates this season.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown on the mound was supposed to be a guarantee. He ended
three-game losing streaks in each of his last two starts, was 5-1
after Dodgers losses and 5-0 at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in worse situations and come out of it pretty
good,'' Johnson said. ``I just told them to forget about this one,
have a good night, and let's get on track. When things are going
bad the dam bursts, and that's what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   But after Brown's first two pitches _ a double by Al Martin and
a homer by Ed Sprague _ the Dodgers trailed 2-0. Kevin Young added
a first-inning homer.
</P>
<P>
   And in the second, the water gushed through the dam. Brian Giles
grounded to Eric Karros, who threw the ball out of catcher Angel
Pena's reach to allow Martin to score. Later, Young reached first
when Brown was late covering on a grounder to Karros. And when
Jason Kendall hit a comebacker to Brown, he forgot there was only
one out and flipped the ball to first. Sprague scored and Brown,
realizing his mistake, hunched over behind the mound. Warren Morris
added an RBI single to give the Pirates a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Just as this inning was unraveling, Dodgers general manager
Kevin Malone returned from Vero Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for the fans,'' Malone said. ``It's discouraging,
it's upsetting, it's frustrating. When you look at the talent we
have and don't see a performance that equates to the talent, it's
puzzling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to figure out how to get out of this rut. Players have
to figure out what they can do to get this thing going. We're here
to support them. If we have the talent, and it's comparable to that
of other baseball clubs, why aren't we performing? This is
difficult.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Sometimes you do all the right things and get all the wrong
results. Chris Holt saw that at work again for most of his seven
innings on the mound Tuesday night, and Scott Elarton got a taste
of it in the ninth as the Atlanta Braves rallied past the Astros
4-3 at the Astrodome.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a tough loss to swallow for the Astros, particularly
Holt, who is still looking for his first win in almost two years.
He is winless in six decisions this season, and the Astros have
lost nine of his 10 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting old,'' Holt said. ``I'm tired of talking about
it. Hopefully I'll get this thing turned around so that we don't
lose every time I pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was Elarton who was charged with the loss in
Tuesday's game, although the stuff he was dealing toward the plate
was hardly the stuff of losers. He struck out three batters in two
innings and had good action on his breaking pitches, not to mention
a lively fastball.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Braves first baseman Brian Hunter was jammed on the
pitch he punched into center field for the game-winning hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I made good pitches,'' Elarton said. ``I jammed
Hunter; it's just one of those things you can't control. It just
didn't work out.''
</P>
<P>
   After allowing only four earned runs in his first 26 innings
this year, Elarton (4-2) has seen his fortunes turn to the tune of
a 10.13 ERA this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt fine,'' he said. ``My mechanics were better, and I went
out there with a lot of confidence. I made good pitches. I'd rather
get beat on good pitches. That's easier to deal with than when you
get beat and make bad pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves starter Tom Glavine didn't make many bad pitches. Then
again, he seldom does when he visits the Astrodome. This season has
been full of struggles for Glavine, but they all seemed to go away
when he laid eyes on his home away from home.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine (4-7) continued his Astrodome mastery, holding the
Astros to three runs on five hits in eight innings. He's 8-0 with a
1.35 ERA in his last 10 starts in the building and can't be too
pleased that the Astros are leaving it for Enron Field next year.
</P>
<P>
   Holt, meanwhile, has to be wondering what he has to do to win a
game anywhere. The Astros' hard-luck pitcher matched Glavine's
performance for seven innings, yielding just five hits and three
runs. But he lost a three-run lead after four innings, and the
Astros could never get back on top.
</P>
<P>
   Braves closer John Rocker pitched a scoreless ninth inning to
earn his 14th save. The Astros got the tying run in scoring
position in the ninth before pinch hitter Russ Johnson hit a sharp
grounder to second to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros haven't had a pinch-hit RBI since Bill Spiers'
two-run double off the bench May 18 in Los Angeles. The team has a
.160 pinch-hit average during that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit the ball hard,'' Johnson said. ``I just hit it right at
him (Braves second baseman Keith Lockhart).''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine, who entered the game with an uncharacteristically high
4.91 ERA, retired 10 of the first 11 batters he faced. He showed
flashes of his two-time Cy Young Award-winning form until the
Astros touched him up for three runs in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell opened the scoring with his second home run in two
nights and his 22nd of the season. Richard Hidalgo drove in a run
with a double, and Carl Everett's team-leading fourth sacrifice fly
gave the Astros a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Now you see it; now you don't.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, the Braves rallied to tie the score against
Holt, whose biggest mistake of the game was allowing a two-run
homer to Andruw Jones in the fifth inning. Randall Simon, whom
Hunter replaced in the seventh, followed with a double and scored
from second thanks to an error by Astros second baseman Craig
Biggio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris pitched well,'' Astros interim manager Matt Galante
said. ``He made a bad pitch with the hanging slider to Jones. But
other than that, he was fine. We had the lead, and we let it get
away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering the way he has pitched in his last four starts, Holt
deserved a better fate. He has a 2.16 ERA during that stretch, and
the Astros have averaged just three runs in those games.
</P>
<P>
   They had chances to beef up the run support in the sixth inning
_ when Holt was still the pitcher of record _ and again in the
eighth. Both times, they had runners on first and second with one
out, and both times they came up empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the key,'' Astros third baseman Tim Bogar said.
``When you get an opportunity against a guy like Glavine, you have
to cash in. You have to give him credit for getting out of those
situations. He definitely got the best of us tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   That seldom happens to the Astros when it comes to facing
lefthanders. They have the best winning percentage (.789) in the
majors against lefthanded starters, and they also lead the majors
with a .317 overall batting average against lefties.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Glavine _ struggling or not _ is not your average
lefty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always nice to win a game against an upper-echelon club,
particularly when things aren't going that great for you,'' Glavine
said. ``If you go out there and beat a lower-echelon club, yeah,
you're happy you won, but you're still wondering, `If I pitch that
same game against one of the top two or three teams in the league,
do I win that game?' Obviously, tonight I can say that.''

KNICKS' RUN ENDS HERE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We are gathered here to interpret the scheduled collision of two
great cities.
</P>
<P>
   In this corner weighing in with its first appearance at the NBA
Finals is ABA orphan San Antonio, whose tastefully old-school motto
is ``Sweep L.A. and remember the Alamo!''
</P>
<P>
   Barging into its eighth Finals from the other corner is New York
City, where the only civic battle cry fit to print in a family
newspaper is ``Freeze!''
</P>
<P>
   On your ``intangibles'' scoreboard, it might be helpful to note
that San Antonio is where honest Davy Crockett tasted the agony of
defeat in Game 7 vs. Santa Ana. New York answers by being known as
the scene of a possible last stand by Knicks executive liar Davy
Checketts.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, San Antonio's Spurs and New York's Knicks square off
tonight in Game 1 of a series that will determine the 52nd champion
of the NBA. This best-of-7 event begins at the Alamodome, a vast
stadium that seems as appropriate for basketball as a battleship is
for bass fishing.
</P>
<P>
   But since you're watching on TV, you don't care about
atmosphere. You care about knowing which team is going to win.
Gambling, of course, is a collateral issue, because you're aware
that it's illegal to bet if you're not in Las Vegas, on the
Internet, or on a pay phone.
</P>
<P>
   You also know through the historical chanting of coaches and
barstool prophets that ``Defense wins championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Say it loud.
</P>
<P>
   OK, that's enough. It might not be a bad idea to get comfy with
another historical imperative. It goes like this: ``Great players
win championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, of course they do. As any Phil Jackson knows, you need
outstanding players to win. But we're not talking about just very
good players. No. What we're selling is the concept of Hall of Fame
players.
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't have anything to do with your spare time, you
might be aware that every NBA championship team with a single
exception had at least one player with a Hall of Fame pedigree.
(The 1979 Seattle crew recently threatened to join the party when
former Dominguez High, Pepperdine, SuperSonics and Boston Celtics
star Dennis Johnson was nominated.)
</P>
<P>
   So why do Hall of Famers win championships? Favorable
officiating? Perhaps, but we'll have to check that theory with
Oliver Stone. Then again, great players may not be considered Hall
material until they win a championship. Roll over, Charles Barkley;
we're just kidding.
</P>
<P>
   Where does that leave the Spurs? It leaves them in a dandy
predicament. David Robinson is a mortal lock for eternal props at
Springfield. Tim Duncan, by lock standards, appears to be flirting
with immortality.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks? Well, Patrick Ewing will be enshrined, but unless he
pulls a Willis Reed won't be on the court. That leaves New York
with the go-to names of Allan Houston, who isn't Fame caliber, and
Latrell Sprewell, whose future credentials would be enhanced by
shooting 1,000 off-season jumpers per day and bribing about 1,000
memory-influenced citizens who vote for such things.
</P>
<P>
   Third-year power forward Marcus Camby hasn't even started for
the Knicks, but if the rest of his career is being advertised by
his playoff run, he'd be a cinch. The Spurs admit they are worried
about Camby, because he's so darned active. Active? The guy appears
to be more lit up than a five-year-old who crashed the line at
Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   But even though he outplayed Duncan in college, Camby could be
doomed in this series.
</P>
<P>
   With such star power against them, just how do the Knicks
compensate? Speed. Sure, the Spurs can haul, too, but most of the
Knicks are quick enough to navigate the New York City subway system
with their wallets in their back pockets.
</P>
<P>
   They should use this quickness to extend their defense, make it
more difficult to dump the ball into Robinson and Duncan, box out,
then run like hell after grabbing the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   And unless you've been in a coma for a month, you're aware that
the Knicks are murder in transition. That's what throttled the
Pacers, though it should be noted that in Indiana, ``transition''
means switching from Miller to Budweiser.
</P>
<P>
   If the Knicks fail to muster a bunch of easy baskets, they're
goners. The Spurs, a collection of law-abiding, renaissance guys
who tape ``Jeopardy'' on game nights, happen to be ogres on
defense.
</P>
<P>
   And we all know what happens when great, law-abiding players
play great defense, right?
</P>
<P>
   Right, they soak each other's skulls with Snapple after Game 5.

OCHOA HOPES TO TURN OPEN FANTASY TO REALITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ To the best of his recollection, former TCU
golfer Alberto Ochoa wrapped up the 1999 U.S. Open championship
eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The title netted him $1 each from other PGA Tour wannabes in the
field at Ebony Hills Golf Course in Edinburg. As a teen-ager,
winning mythical majors at the nine-hole facility in the Rio Grande
Valley became a way to stretch a shoestring budget for Ochoa.
</P>
<P>
   Contestants would agree on a future championship that all
expected to be old enough to enter _ 1999 Open, 2000 Masters _ and
cheat Father Time by playing it that day. Entry fee was $1 per
player, winner take all. Ochoa, 22, proved to be the Valley's
version of Jack Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, I was always taking their money,'' Ochoa said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if life imitates fantasy, Ochoa would collect a lot more
than lunch money by winning the real-world version of the 1999
Open, which begins tomorrow at Pinehurst Resort and Country Club.
But he'd settle for a strong finish and confidence boost that would
help validate his decision to leave school in December, midway
through his senior season, to pursue his pro career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it wasn't the right thing to do. Who knows?'' Ochoa said
of his decision to accept a $100,000, multiyear commitment from a
group of Valley-based businessmen to help launch his quest for a
PGA Tour card. ``If I'd stayed, maybe I would've won the NCAA
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I wanted to be as prepared as possible for qualifying
school this fall. That's where my future is. I figured the more pro
experience I had before Q-school, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Open berth, which Ochoa earned June 7 during a rain-soaked
qualifying tournament in West Palm Beach, Fla., should provide the
litmus test the two-time All-American seeks to gauge his progress
as a pro. Ochoa struggled with his driver early in the season,
failing in four attempts to land berths in Nike Tour events. He has
yet to finish better than 35th in a tournament on the Golden Bear
Tour, a minitour in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But after months of struggling, Ochoa began splitting fairways
during the 36-hole qualifier. He opened with a 68, lowest round of
the tournament, then coasted home in 74 as the skies opened and
scores soared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shooting the 68 changed my whole attitude,'' said Ochoa, who
will be making his debut in one of golf's major championships.
``I'd been playing in the trees for the last six months. Now, my
confidence is back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's not possible for me to win the Open. But I'm always
going to think, `Why not?' Those guys on the PGA Tour are no
different from me. I've shot 64s and 65s before. Why not this
week?''
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, TCU coach Bill Montigel said Ochoa has
nothing to prove to him _ this week or in the future. Although the
player's December departure was instrumental in TCU's fall from
12th in the NCAA (1998) to fifth in the Western Athletic Conference
(1999) in a one-year period, Ochoa left in good academic standing
and in good graces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could get another guy that good for 3 1/2 years,''
Montigel said. ``He did all he could in college golf. He's still
No. 1 in my book, and I'm rooting for him. I know this is a huge
week for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Much bigger than when Ochoa won the mythical version of the '99
Open, back during his teen-age years in Edinburg.
SPOTLIGHT ON
Janzen in comfort zone in bid for third Open title
</P>
<P>
   Even when he let his imagination work overtime, Lee Janzen never
expected to be in this situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a kid, I dreamed of winning a U.S. Open. But I never
dreamed of winning it twice,'' said Janzen, the defending champion
who is considered a serious threat to add title No. 3 because of
his comfort level with Pinehurst No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does Janzen call it his favorite course, he also
finished second at Pinehurst in the 1992 Tour Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't explain what it is,'' said Janzen, 34, an eight-event
winner on the PGA Tour. ``I just have confidence that I can play
well on this course. I have confidence I will do well in this
tournament. Whatever it is, I've probably looked forward to this
U.S. Open more than any other one I've played in. And that includes
the two I've won.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed for an explanation for his success on Open courses,
Janzen said: ``At the Open, you have got to know exactly how far
you're hitting the ball. If you need to land it four steps on the
green, you have to be able to do that. Maybe I land the ball closer
to the exact distance I'm trying to hit it than the other guys.
Maybe I just have more of a conservative approach. I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   This much is known. A victory would allow Janzen to join Hale
Irwin on the short list of three-time Open champions. The record is
four titles, shared by four players, including Jack Nicklaus and
Ben Hogan.
</P>
<P>
   CHIP SHOTS
Colonial experience helps
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Ochoa said lessons learned during the 1997 MasterCard
Colonial should help this week at Pinehurst.
</P>
<P>
   Ochoa shot rounds of 71-75 as an amateur at Colonial, missing
the cut in his lone PGA Tour appearance. During his opening round
at Colonial, Ochoa stood 3 under through 13 holes, but carded four
bogeys coming in.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was from a lack of experience,'' Ochoa said. ``I got to 3
under and tried to get to 6 under by shooting at too many pins. You
can't force things to happen out here. I'll learn from that and
won't make the same mistake again this week.''
Seeking the right mix
</P>
<P>
   Heading into his fifth U.S. Open, Tiger Woods has yet to post a
top-10 finish in the event. But Woods, 23, has won twice in the
past month _ once in Germany, and then at the Memorial Tournament _
and said he's finally come to terms with the blend of patience and
aggression to succeed on a layout like Pinehurst No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first couple of Opens, I was too aggressive,'' said Woods,
who altered his approach for 1997, rarely using his driver at
Congressional Country Club. ``Then, at Congressional, I went so
conservative, I played worse. I realize now there's a mixture in
there that you have to find. There's a balance and you have to feel
it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods said the right mix at Pinehurst might result in an
over-par score by the winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would take 72 straight pars. But the reality of that
happening is slim,'' Woods said.
Conversions questioned
</P>
<P>
   Count Davis Love III among the group of contestants less than
thrilled with the U.S. Golf Association's decision to convert two
of Pinehurst's par-5 holes (No. 8, No. 16) into par-4s, measuring
485 and 489 yards, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think changing the par-5s to par-4s have created some
demanding holes, if not unfair holes,'' said Love, whose father
used to teach at the course. ``You'll have to be real patient on
both of those.''

RANGERS' RODRIGUEZ MISSES GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
NEW YORK _ Rangers catcher Ivan Rodriguez, who played only one
inning Monday before leaving with back spasms, missed Tuesday
night's game against the New York Yankees and is listed as
day-to-day.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The spasms made for a near-sleepless night for Rodriguez, who
``had a very uncomfortable night,'' manager Johnny Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's feeling better, but it still bothers him when he squats
to catch,'' trainer Danny Wheat said. ``It's a possibility he'll
play \RWednesday\S. We'll treat him, and hopefully he'll be ready
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was replaced by Gregg Zaun, who made his first start
in a night game this season. Rangers sign first pick The Rangers
signed Bakersfield (Calif.) College right-hander Colby Lewis, the
organization's first selection and 38th overall in the 1999
First-Year Player Draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers assigned the 19-year-old pitcher to Pulaski, their
rookie-league affiliate in the Appalachian League. The Rangers
would not divulge the signing bonus awarded; Chris Jones, selected
38th overall in 1998 by San Francisco, received $587,500.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Rangers signed right-handed pitcher David Mead,
their second selection and the 47th overall. Rangers scouting
director Chuck McMichael praised area scouts Kipp Fagg, Mike
Paustin and Dennis Meeks for laying the foundation for the quick,
acrimony-free signings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fortunate circumstance for them and for us,'' McMichael
said. Errant ERA With an 8.38 earned-run average after Monday's 8-2
loss to the Yankees, Rangers starter Mark Clark has the highest ERA
among American League qualifiers, but he is not in danger of being
removed from the rotation, Johnny Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   However, John Burkett could return to the rotation at some
point, Oates said. Burkett pitched two scoreless innings Monday and
has allowed only one run in his past three appearances covering 7
1/3 innings to drop his ERA from 10.54 to 8.57.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a manager, you're always thinking and looking at all the
possibilities,'' Oates said. ``It's not written in cement that John
won't start again. It's a daily evaluation.'' nn

 &HT;    Europe's top star seeks a major change of luck
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pinehurst, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland's Colin Montgomerie brings a new mindset this week to
the U.S. Open, where he often has felt the heat on both sides of
the ropes. After three near-misses in the major championship he
enjoys more than any other, the dominant player of Europe is
calling on help from all challengers on his side of the pond.
</P>
<P>
   No U.S. Open has been won by a European player since England's
Tony Jacklin in 1971. With that fact in mind, after his initial
tour of Pinehurst No. 2 Tuesday, the 35-year-old Montgomerie seemed
all but ready to hoist a European flag over the Carolina Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The runoffs (of the greens) are quite similar to (the Masters
in) Augusta in many ways,'' Montgomerie said, ``and we've won 11
out of the last 20 of them, so it might well favor the European
player here for the first time in many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie's comments came with a touch of playfulness, but
they were delivered with authority. While there's really no
explaining how Montgomerie can win six consecutive money titles on
the European Tour but go winless in America, it's equally puzzling
why the U.S. Open has not been as pleasant as Augusta National for
the Europeans. And enough is enough, Montgomerie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's motivation for every British golfer and also
every European golfer to try and emulate that feat (by Jacklin),''
he said. ``I think it's been too long, really. It's almost 30 years
now. (Nick) Faldo has lost in playoffs, and so have I, so we've
been quite close. It's just a matter of being patient and trying to
walk through when that door is half ajar. It's the point of walking
through it and not finishing second.''
</P>
<P>
   This year could be different. The rough is manageable by USGA
standards, and with creativity around the greens at Pinehurst No. 2
more crucial than driving the ball long and straight, the European
factor could be more noticeable. For those who doubt, remember the
Ryder Cup at Valderrama. And while chipping and putting might not
be Montgomerie's strong suit, it surely finds itself on the resume
of Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of course brings in the possibility of a win for the
likes of a player like Olazabal,'' Montgomerie said, ``who might
not hit the ball as straight off some of the tees. These fairways
are giving him more of a chance of doing that, and to use his
enormous talent around the greens, and his imagination, which this
will take.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, Montgomerie's chances could again depend on outside
forces. American crowds have never warmed to him, unfortunately,
and on several occasions they have shouted insults. Last year,
David Duval and Jim Furyk said they were embarrassed by fan
comments to the Scot, who actually is one of the more likeable
players around.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as Monty does not let the crowd get to him,'' Olazabal
said, ``he's got to have a great chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he is perceived by American audiences and why they
have not warmed to him, Montgomerie played dumb to the question,
but he recognized it as a no-win situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never really thought about it, to be honest,'' he said,
smiling. ``Such a good question, you've stumped me. . . . I really
do feel I get similar treatment to any other European or foreign
player that comes over to America.''
</P>
<P>
   For certain, Montgomerie's game could not be much sharper. He
won twice in three weeks in Europe, including a smashing Sunday at
the Volvo PGA Championship with a closing 64.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colin is probably playing the best he has ever played, and
that's saying a lot,'' Ernie Els said. ``He is just lapping the
field, and the way he is playing now he will probably win a major.
``
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie came into Congressional two years ago on a similar
run and opened with a 65, eventually finishing second to Els.
Although much has been made of the seven-footer for par that
Montgomerie missed at the 71st hole, after a long wait because of
rowdy fans, his real demise that week was a second-round 76. He
calls the opening 65 ``as good as I can play,'' but he termed the
64 two weeks ago at Wentworth nearly as fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just haven't managed to find the necessary form for four
days,'' Monty said. ``I did it for three at Congressional and threw
in a 76 in the second round. You can't afford to do that. . . .
It's just a matter of trying to maintain form and confidence,
because the game is there. I've just got to go out with the same
belief that I take into the European tournaments, and hopefully it
will work out.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, Montgomerie's putting will have to be near-perfect. When
he tied Steve Elkington in the 1995 PGA at Riviera, eventually
losing the playoff, he had used 17 putts more than the Australian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never blamed my long game,'' Monty said. ``I just haven't
holed out as well as the winner has.

 &HT;    The game of golf gets a trendy self-help aspect
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News ServiceR
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's 16 hours till the first Saturday morning tee
times, but on the putting green inside Kennesaw, Georgia's
Golfsmith superstore, the mind games are already in full swing.
</P>
<P>
   Am I gripping the club correctly? Are my feet the right distance
apart?
</P>
<P>
   Who am I, really?
</P>
<P>
   That last thought, at least, is what publishers would have you
believe is going on inside golfers' heads. Or should be. From
bookstore shelves to best-seller lists, a new trend is plainly
evident: Golf no longer is just about getting the ball in the hole.
Now it's also about getting in touch with yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spiritual-type books have been the boom for the past four to
five years,'' said Paul Gediman, nonfiction editor for the
``Forecast'' section of Publishers Weekly. ``If anyone can tie golf
to self-help and what people need to know in everyday life, it
probably will do well.''
</P>
<P>
   These ``I putt, therefore I am'' books have arrived just in time
for Father's Day _ to help attract the male audience at which they
clearly seem targeted. Among them are two from self-help's heaviest
hitters:
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Golf and the Spirit _ Lessons for the Journey'' by M. Scott
Peck, whose 1985 ``The Road Less Traveled'' remains the
best-selling self-help book of all time.
</P>
<P>
   -- And ``Chicken Soup for the Golfer's Soul,'' the latest from
the ultra-successful, ultra-ubiquitous ``Chicken Soup'' franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's opening up a whole new genre,'' said Chrissy
Donnelly, a ``Chicken Soup'' co-author and avid golfer. ``People
are really linking up to the idea that golf is a metaphor for life
and that you can learn all of life's lessons out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even comedian Bill Murray has gotten into the act. Long revered
by boys of all ages for his 1980 film ``Caddyshack,'' Murray's
book, ``Cinderella Story: My Life in Golf,'' is as much about
inspiration as it is yuks.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, you may ask, what keeps a man going when the chips are
down?'' Murray writes in a passage bridging a hilarious account
about a bad day on the golf course and a more revealing section
about his struggles for laughs and attention as one of nine
children.``It's a journey, you animal, not a destination. You just
keep plugging.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's nothing unique about an early summer
onslaught of golf books . Even those that go beyond the how-to or
``how he did it'' genre have some precedence: 1995's ``The Legend
of Bagger Vance: A Novel of Golf and the Game of Life'' was a
surprise hit; Robert Redford's film version starts shooting in
South Carolina this fall. ``Golf in the Kingdom,'' Michael Murphy's
1972 novel about mystical Scottish golf pro is widely considered a
classic.
</P>
<P>
   So consider what's happening now to be the next wave. And
there's good reason _ sales of spiritual books alone are expected
to hit 133 million by next year, a number that could go much higher
if even a small percentage of the estimated 27 million golf-playing
Americans make a purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Crass commercialism aside, how people react to what happens on
the golf course can teach them a lot about themselves, says Atlanta
sports psychologist James Millhouse. That's because golf is a game
in which one's sense of control can last about as long as it takes
a sudden gust of wind to knock a ``perfect'' shot off course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same in life,'' pointed out Mona Vold, author of the
newly-released ``Different Strokes: The Lives and Teachings of the
Game's Wisest Women.'' ``There is a whole willingness now, I think,
to think further into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But, not to be too blunt about it, does anyone really want to?
</P>
<P>
   Sales figures would seem to indicate yes _ Peck's book on Monday
was ranked 138th among Amazon.com's three million available titles.
``Cinderella Story'' hit No. 13 on this past Sunday's New York
Times' nonfiction bestseller list. And ``Chicken Soup'' was No. 2
on the Times' ``Advice, How-to and Miscellaneous'' paperback list.
</P>
<P>
   But, curiously, it's kinda hard finding a real person who'll
admit to buying any of these ``inner golfer'' titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a lovely mindset that golf is like life, but it's not
very practical,'' said Atlantan Mike Lazzo, 41, a self-described
``book obsessed'' person who plays golf about once a week. ``If you
want to improve any aspect of golf or your life, get busy. Get out
there on the driving range of life and work on your swing!''
</P>
<P>
   Lazzo was one of about a dozen golfers informally surveyed last
week, none of whom seemed to have the slightest interest in using
the game to learn more about themselves or life. Let alone reading
about how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they're already using golf to get in touch with
themselves. They just don't know it yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they get something deeper in golf, even though maybe
they won't realize it or say it,'' said Donnelly. ``A lot of them
aren't open with their emotions, but it's filling that need that
they have to be with nature and with themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it's not male golfers whom these books are being
marketed to after all. At Phipps Plaza's Doubleday Book Shop,
staffers say most inquiries about Peck's new book come from women
who have no idea it's golf-themed. Indeed, Peck says he wrote
``Spirit'' for his traditional audience ``in the hopes that
non-golfers would become more interested in golf or at least go
deeper into their own spiritual journeys.''
</P>
<P>
   Or at least buy it for their husbands. Woodstock resident Al
Moreno may not have much interest in getting in touch with his
inner golfer _ ``The same four of us have played together for eight
years, and we're just out there to have a good time'' _ but he knew
something about ``Chicken Soup for the Golfer's Soul'' when it was
pointed out to him on Golfsmith's shelf last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife has them all,'' Moreno said of the ``Chicken Soup''
books. ``If she comes over here and sees it, she'll probably buy it
for me for Fathers Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Just don't expect Mike Lazzo to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the golf course really was like life,'' he sighed, ``nobody
would play.''

 &HT;    The game of golf gets a trendy self-help aspect
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's 16 hours till the first Saturday morning tee
times, but on the putting green inside Kennesaw, Georgia's
Golfsmith superstore, the mind games are already in full swing.
</P>
<P>
   Am I gripping the club correctly? Are my feet the right distance
apart?
</P>
<P>
   Who am I, really?
</P>
<P>
   That last thought, at least, is what publishers would have you
believe is going on inside golfers' heads. Or should be. From
bookstore shelves to best-seller lists, a new trend is plainly
evident: Golf no longer is just about getting the ball in the hole.
Now it's also about getting in touch with yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spiritual-type books have been the boom for the past four to

   1. 'REAL WORLD' ROMANCE BLOSSOMS IN HAWAII Seven strangers are
thrown together to live in a plantation-style beachfront home in
Hawaii. Their lives are documented 24 hours a day. Whether they're
brushing their teeth or dealing with emotional problems, these
twentysomethings are in front of the camera, fully aware that
millions of people will be observing their experiences each week on
MTV. Welcome to the popular docudrama ``The Real World.'' By Tamara
Conniff. BPI. 800 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 2.
LIVING LA VIDA BUENA Puerto Rican singer Ricky Martin was the
centre of the pop universe, at least for a week. He's a former
child star whose performance at the Grammy Award signaled a flood
of interest in his hip-shaking Latin pop. Martin's English-language
debut album sold 660,000 copies in its opening week. ``Latin music
is going to stay,'' says Emilio Estefan, the dean of Latin
producers. By Steve Morse. The Boston Globe. 1,400 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 3.
DeFOREST KELLEY : THE REAL McCOY In this special column, Ian
Spelling, the noted science fiction writer and author of The New
York Times Syndicate's Inside Trek and Sci-Fi column, remembers
DeForest Kelley, who died on June 11 (Kelley played the irascible
medic Dr. Leonard ``Bones'' McCoy in ``Star Trek.'') ``My legacy is
that I have inspired a great number of people to enter the medical
world,'' said Kelley last August. ``These people are doctors now,
all kinds of doctors who save lives and help other people in other
ways.'' By Ian Spelling. 750 words + photos.
_____________________________________________________________ 4.
ROCK'S QUIRKIEST BAND REINVENTS ITSELF After having redefined what
was considered ``modern'' and ``alternative'' rock since 1983, the
members of R.E.M. were afraid it might be time to put their group
to sleep. Their drummer, Bill Berry, suffered a near-fatal double
brain aneurysm during a world tour and retired in 1997. Now the
remaining trio is justifiably psyched about its latest album,
``Up.'' They believe the drastic changes they made actually
strengthened the band. By Gary Graff. 1,000 words + photo. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
------------- 5. JUST MAD ABOUT SAFFRON Ex-model Saffron Burrows
abandoned the fashion runway for the big screen. Burrows, 26, plays
twins who have never met in ``The Loss of Sexual Innocence,'' the
latest film written and directed by Mike Figgis, which is sure to
cause a stir with both its non-linear form and explicit content.
But controversy is something Burrows can handle. Her radical
childhood in London, with strong trade unionist parents, was filled
with it. By Jessica Kerwin. From Women's Wear Daily. 700 words +
photo.

'ALIEN'-ATION : SCI-FI'S LANDMARK HORROR FLICK,
</P>
<P>
   20 YEARS LATER The year was 1979. Jimmy Carter, Anwar Sadat and
Menachem Begin signed the Camp David peace accords and Ayatollah
Khomeini replaced the Shah as ruler of Iran. And in space no one
could hear you scream. Believe it or not, it's been 20 years since
Ridley Scott's ``Alien'' scared moviegoers silly with its moody
atmosphere and, of course, the notorious chest-burster sequence,
one of the most viscerally frightening scenes ever filmed. By Ian
Spelling. 1,300 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 7.
APPLE CORE : 'ER'S' NOAH WYLE PLAYS STEVE JOBS Noah Wyle steps out
of his character as ``ER's'' likable Dr. Carter for a trip through
the computer world as Steve Jobs in ``Pirates of Silicon Valley.''
Wyle's emergence as a sex symbol in ``ER'' still bemuses him as he
values his privacy. By Ivor Davis. 1,300 words + photos. (N/A Great
Britain and Australia.)
_____________________________________________________________ 8.
SARAH McLACHLAN : LILITH'S LEAD LADY IS MOMMY-MINDED Talking about
Sarah McLachlan, the phrase that people keep coming back to is
``one-woman industry.'' McLachlan is as refreshingly direct in
person as she is in her music. By Andrew Ryan. From TV Guide
Canada. 1,300 words + photos.
_____________________________________________________________ 9.
EVERETT'S PEAK Rupert Everett can just see the headline now.
Hollywood's most prominent openly gay actor playing a royal sprite
in a glam film version of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream?'' What else
but ``King of the Fairies.'' Everett has learned to deal with the
vagaries of fame with sharp wit, droll insouciance and the supreme
confidence that comes from his lanky good looks. By Merle Ginsberg.
From W magazine. 1,500 words + photo.

NATO LETS RUSSIAN TROOPS RESUPPLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The 200 Russian troops who sprinted into Kosovo last
weekend ahead of NATO and then took control of the regional
capital's airport caught the alliance badly off guard. The daring
move also provided a brief surge of national pride for a country
that has grown used to seeing its once-proud military humiliated.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, things started getting back to normal.
</P>
<P>
   To make their dash, the Russian troops had to travel light, and
Tuesday their lack of supplies caught up with them. They were
forced to bum cigarettes from local passers-by, and ask for water
from the British troops they still refuse to let into the airport.
</P>
<P>
   This was just what NATO was waiting for. The alliance has gone
out of its way to play down the significance of the Russians in
Pristina and at the same time play up the partnership with their
fellow peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The British happily agreed, and just as willingly supplied a
military escort to a column of Russian trucks filled with food,
water and money from a Russian peacekeeping brigade in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Much like the troops they sent into Kosovo, the generals in
Moscow who gave the orders, with President Boris N. Yeltsin's
approval, were able to score a quick victory but do not have the
resources to compete with NATO over the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has neither the money to pay for a large peacekeeping
force nor the political clout it needs to force NATO to accept its
demands that its troops control a separate sector of Kosovo,
outside of the alliance's comand.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow would like to increase the number of its troops in
Kosovo, and has a paratroop division waiting to go. But Romanian,
Bulgarian and Hungarian officials have refused permission for
Russian military planes to overfly their countries until Russia
agrees with NATO on the role of its peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   If Russia's military chiefs were humiliated by their inability
to stop NATO from bombing Yugoslavia, and by NATO's unwillingness
to agree to their peacekeeping demands, how does it make them feel
to be denied airspace by their former East European allies?
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Russia's civilian leadership, most of which
was left out of the loop when the plan to occupy Pristina's airport
was unleashed.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin, doing an admirable job
of hiding the humiliation he must have felt when the orders to move
into Kosovo were given without his knowledge last Friday, said
Moscow had restored order to its Balkans policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing we agreed is that all work on the Kosovo
problem should be coordinated,'' said Stepashin after meeting
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin also said he believed ``friction'' with the United
States over Kosovo would be resolved at a series of bilateral
meetings this week. He should hope so: Stepashin plans to meet
Thursday with the International Monetary Fund's managing director,
Michel Camdessus, to discuss new loans to help pay off previous
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday secretaries of state and defense Madeleine Albright
and William Cohen are due to meet in Helsinki with their Russian
counterparts. Tuesday, Russian security chief Vladimir Putin
proposed, in a phone conversation with U.S. national security
adviser Sander Berger, creating a command-by-committee for all
Kosovo peacekeepers in which a Russian officer would decide which
decisions to relay onto Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, which has insisted on a single, unified command, may have
trouble with that. But last week's developments clearly showed,
once again, that Yeltsin, and whoever is giving him advice -- is
capable of pursuing any policy if it meets his short-term political
needs. This is something President Clinton should remember when he
meets the Russian president Sunday at a summit of the G7 leading
industrial nations in the German city of Cologne.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Kremlin has credited Yeltsin for the bold move into
Kosovo, the president himself has yet to comment on the action his
troops took. Kremlin observers suspect a favorite Yeltsin political
tactic is behind his silence over the Kosovo mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it succeeds, the president can say it was his initiative,''
said Russian legislator Alexei Arbatov. ``If it doesn't succeed, if
the coffins start coming in, if then he can say it wasn't his
idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Arbatov said this is no way for the commander in chief to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be protecting the Russian soldiers who are there,
not the Russian president,'' Arbatov said on Russian television.
``Without a clear statement of policy from the Russian president,
nothing is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The nationalists and Communists who dominate the State Duma,
Russia's lower house of parliament, were elated by the rapid
deployment of the first Russian troops in Kosovo. But now they want
answers as the Serbs, the historical allies Moscow wants to
protect, flee the province in droves.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Inculcated, that was the word George Bush used.
He said he had the drive to serve inculcated into him by his
father, the future senator from Connecticut, Prescott Bush, who
believed in noblesse oblige, believed it the solemn obligation of
the elite to serve for the greater societal good. The future
senator inculcated that belief into his second son, the future
president, George Herbert Walker Bush. That son went off to West
Texas, and he raised a family and did some inculcating of his own.
In those days, when the Kennedys reigned as American royalty, the
senior senator's son was on occasion heard to say, ``Just wait till
I turn these Bush boys out.''
</P>
<P>
   The oldest of those Bush boys _ George Dubya, as he is known in
Texas _ is now poised to continue the family tradition. After
months of conspicuously not running for president, he finally made
it clear in Iowa last Saturday that he is seeking the office.
</P>
<P>
   The first election of the 21st century then, we currently
assume, will be The Clash of the Scions, Al Gore vs. George W.
Bush. One, Gore, went to Vietnam and didn't fight; the other, Bush,
flew fighter jets and didn't go to Vietnam. One toked a little pot;
the other declines to give a full accounting of his youthful
indiscretions and emphatically considers the matter closed. The
public perceives one as exuding the charisma and warmth of a cheap
Formica countertop; the other is regarded, even by his frustrated
political enemies, as impossible to personally dislike. One has
spent decades being groomed for this moment; the other has
strenuously spent at least the last year not running for president,
listening to the whole world tell him it's his to lose.

   The other officers aboard the aircraft carrier San Jacinto just
loved calling him by his patrician full name _
George-Herbert-Walker-Bush. But he was one of the guys _ even had
his wife's name, Barbara, painted on his plane, and that went
against the rules. So thorough was his inculcation that he joined
the service the day he turned 18. He flew bombers, and one day,
Sept. 2, 1944, over the Bonin Islands in the Pacific, he took heavy
flak en route to his target. He toughed it through the fire, made
his drop, headed back out to sea and ditched his TBM Avenger. The
other two guys didn't make it _ he'd called for them before he
bailed out and heard nothing.
</P>
<P>
   George-Herbert-Walker-Bush _ ``Poppy'' back home _ was rescued
and returned a war hero, although he'd never think to use the term
_ his mother taught him not to brag, to give the other guy credit.
He went to Yale, as his father had, and found time for 16
activities, everything from captain of the baseball team to the
secret society Skull and Bones. At their wedding reception in the
first week of 1945, Poppy told Barbara, or Bar, as she was also
known: ``Enjoy it. It's the last time I'll ever dance in public.''
Or so the story goes.
</P>
<P>
   George Walker Bush was born in New Haven, Conn., on July 6,
1946.
</P>
<P>
   The very senior senator gave George-Herbert-Walker-Bush a red
two-door Studebaker, and the day after graduation in the summer of
1948, Poppy loaded that car up and pointed it west, arranging for
Bar and baby George to follow. They were headed for an outpost so
remote it may as well have been outer space to the Bushes of
Greenwich: Odessa, Texas, where dust storms were major
meteorological events, where George Bush and scores of other
postwar Ivy League grads intended to make their fortunes in oil.
The place was pregnant with the stuff _ you could stick a dessert
fork in the ground in those days and make a major discovery. After
a brief time in California, the family moved 20 miles down the road
from Odessa to Midland, which had one big advantage over Odessa:
There the family could get away from the mother-daughter prostitute
tag team who lived and worked on the other side of the crudely
partitioned shotgun duplex on East Seventh Street. By 1952 _ the
year Prescott Bush, back in Connecticutt, won election to the U.S.
Senate _ Midland was the boomingest boomtown in West Texas, with
$22 million worth of building permits. (By the end of the decade
those homes and businesses would be empty. Welcome to the oil
bidness.) Hank Williams died on New Year's Eve of that year.
Eisenhower was president, Shivers was governor, polio was still a
threat, and one Master Haskell Goebel Harris was heralded in a
full-page ad in the local paper as ``Midland County's first white
baby of 1953.''
</P>
<P>
   It was still a small town, or had been when the Bushes arrived
in 1950. Although Midland would sprout a cluster of tall buildings
as monuments to its sporadic affluence, paved streets in parts of
town remained a near-novelty. Then there was the really baffling
thing about the Permian Basin: no trees. Or rather, a few dejected,
transplanted saplings that looked none too pleased, seemed to be
asking, ``Why me?'' Barbara Bush gave birth to John Ellis Bush, the
future governor of Florida whom the family would call Jebbie, in
February 1953. (Two other Bush boys, Marvin and Neil, as well as a
daughter, Doro, would follow.) But a family tragedy loomed, too:
Pauline Robinson Bush, George W.'s younger sister, would die of
leukemia in October before her fourth birthday. George and Barbara
didn't tell their elder son his sister was dying.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did well enough to move the family into a nice house on
Sentinel with a swimming pool. Young George played Little League in
the neighborhood and attended Sam Houston Elementary School with
his future wife, whom he did not know.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush was in Houston by the time he ran for the U.S.
Senate against Ralph Yarborough in 1964. Yarborough wouldn't
debate, so Bush and his pal Martin Allday came up with the famous
empty-chair debates, with a tape recording on a chair sitting in
for Yarborough. They got a lot of mileage out of that, but LBJ was
in the White House by then and his coattails stretched from El Paso
to Nacogdoches.
</P>
<P>
   Young George W., when home on break from Andover, sat in on
strategy meetings. And on election night, in the Houston ballroom
his dad had rented for the victory reception that never happened,
young George W. wept.
</P>
<P>
   Winter without girls
</P>
<P>
   So this kid from Midland, a town of oil nomads as polite as the
land is flat, goes to prep school in Massachusetts. He enrolls in
Phillips Academy, which sits atop a long, gradual hill stretching
through Andover, Mass. Think of one of those perennially autumnal
places, hundreds of acres of trees and brick and scowling faculty
who will be addressed as ``sir.'' Think Holden Caulfield. Think ``A
Separate Peace.'' Think a young John Irving hanging around the gym
in gray sweats except _ oops _ he went to Exeter, Andover's
cheerfully despised rival.
</P>
<P>
   These young men had gotten into the most prestigious academy in
the United States, and they were going to be punished for it.
</P>
<P>
   Morning chapel was mandatory, as was jacket and tie. The class
work was unrelenting, the faculty unforgiving. The syllabus for
History 4, a course required of seniors and purported to be the
hardest at the school, ran 300 pages. Fear, intimidation and
humiliation were trusted teaching tools. Of one one particularly
imposing math teacher, a member of the class of '64 later told
writer Nina Savin Scott: ``I was awed and entertained by him. There
was something very engaging in the prospect of death.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, no girls. The educational wisdom of the day maintained
that a boy could not have a top-notch education bludgeoned _
inculcated _ into him while in the agitating presence of the fair
sex. Girls from Abbot, the nearby girls' school that would
eventually be absorbed into Phillips, weren't even allowed to write
letters to Phillips boys as late as 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Classmate Tom Seligson, now a producer for CBS-TV: ``I organize
the reunions, and it's like going back to a prison reunion. This
was an atmosphere where there was a lot of cruelty to other
classmates. He never did any of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Young George was instead a social creature, one who went out of
his way to make everybody comfortable, even if they weren't in his
clique. It was here that Bush, as much a New Englander as a Texan,
honed an essential political skill: getting along with everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Bush roommate John Kidde: ``George and I played sports _ I
played a lot of sports _ and there are some kids at Andover who are
not very outgoing or socially dialed-in, nerds or whatever you want
to call them. I remember two or three of us would be getting lunch
and there'd be Joe Blow, one of the straight-A students who never
talked and nobody socialized with him, and we'd sit down and start
talking and George would make a joke or a comment and always bring
this guy into the conversation, make him a part of the group. He
was real good at that. He always made people feel very comfortable
around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush arrived perhaps no less prepared than his classmates.
</P>
<P>
   John Kidde, who now runs a food-processing company: ``I don't
know if anybody's prepared to go to that place. I had A's and B's
before, and it still knocked my socks off. It was just really
tough. Really tough.'' Friends remember Bush as a satisfactory
student who worked hard, but who was plainly more interested in
sports than academics.
</P>
<P>
   The calendar said it was the early 1960s, but at Andover it was
still the Cold War '50s. Nine buildings were designated as fallout
shelters, stocked with two weeks' worth of food, water and
supplies. Officials reported that the buildings were sufficiently
resistant to radiation and could be made even more so in the event
of nuclear attack by covering the windows. Pop music was less of a
threat _ there was a campus combo called The Satans, but its
members didn't look much like Marilyn Manson in their natty jackets
and ties. When a few students dared to let their hair shag out like
the Beatles, school officials warned them to shape up.
</P>
<P>
   Students caught with booze could be expelled, but the
student-produced yearbook, Pot Pourri, went out of its way to show
boys in gleeful rebellion against that and other rules. Students
didn't have to work hard to get their pictures in the yearbook with
a can of Budweiser in hand, exaggeratedly scoping a Playboy or
puffing on a cigar. There are no pictures of George W. Bush so
occupied. John Kidde never saw him drink while at Andover.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is instead shown posing with the cheerleading
squad, or outside a phone booth crammed full of boys, or acting as
high commissioner of stickball. Good, clean, boyish high jinks,
corny but not enough political dynamite to blow the good ship W2K
out of the water. In his senior picture, he wears the same
asymmetrical grin both his grandfather and father exhibited. The
eyebrows still needed some growing into.
</P>
<P>
   In the yearbook he was called a BMOC and a wit. He escaped
categorization as an intellectual, cynic, ``butt friend,''
alcoholic or social climber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lip'' came, of course, from his lightning wit.
</P>
<P>
   ``George was quick with a quip,'' said Jack Morrison, a close
friend from Andover and Yale. ``He always had a twinkle in his eye
and a ready retort in his mouth. He often got the last word in.''
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush spent that senior year down the hill in America
House, a sizable old Colonial-style dorm that looks like it's a
prime candidate for the next Sears Weatherbeater paint commercial.
It is named America House because there, in 1832, Samuel F. Smith
wrote ``America.'' (``My country, 'tis of thee . . .'' You know
that'll turn up at the convention bio-flick. Better than being from
A Place Called Hope.)
</P>
<P>
   Senior year was when boys found whether they were going to their
first-choice college. If not, life was over. Some 230 boys
graduated that year, and most of them were fed into the best four
or five schools in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Like the old man, George W. Bush was going to Yale.
</P>
<P>
   Everything Falls Apart: New Haven, 1968
</P>
<P>
   They all seemed to loved George W. at Yale. Everybody except
John Lincoln, who lived across the hall from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``George was a member of Deke, the fraternity known to be the
drinking fraternity,'' Lincoln said. Nor did Lincoln, a computer
graphic artist, find the younger Bush's intellect to be formidable.
When word of Bush's White House ambition got out, ``I said to
myself, `You know, he's not all that smart.' Which is maybe what
the job takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Those on the prep school-Ivy League track were expected to
excel, go to business or law school, put on a suit and run the
world. It had been so for generations. But the academy was on the
verge of huge change in those days. In the early '60s at Yale,
jeans were pressed and worn with a belt. Students recall no more
than a couple of rebels _ out of 4,000 _ with long hair. There'd be
day trips to Vassar, or mixers where buses would park on York
Street and disgorge loads of girls from other schools. Then, just
before the winter break of '66, three guys had the unfortunate
distinction of being the first Yalies busted for smoking pot. It
was a national scandal. Students went home and were confronted with
parents demanding to know, What on earth is going on at that
school?
</P>
<P>
   Jack Morrison was Bush's bridge partner in the unending game at
Davenport College, and he caught Bush's pitches on the Davenport
baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things I remember are the times we would go on road trips
and just be weak with laughter,'' said Morrison, a former Pillsbury
executive who now is a partner in a private investment firm in
Minneapolis. ``We'd pile into a car and head off to some girls'
school up north. Never really got in any serious trouble at all,
but came close a couple of times. There were a couple of times when
you could say we probably consumed more than we should have, but
nothing terribly serious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Binge drinking'' hadn't been coined as a term, let alone
labeled a problem. Getting loaded was a hallowed part of college
life, and the Dekes reveled in the intertwined manly pursuits of
sports and drinking. But what about the rumored dancing naked and
drunk on a bar in New Haven? ``He never danced naked anywhere as
far as I know,'' Jack Morrison said. ``There was a lot of high
jinks, but nothing out of the ordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, out in the world, everything was out of the ordinary.
Lyndon Johnson killed the graduate school draft deferment, and
suddenly hordes of young men were hearing the call of divinity
school, one of a dwindling number of legitimate safe havens. Lines
of jittery young men stretched around the block from National Guard
offices. Vietnam, or how to avoid it, was the topic of every other
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The Tet Offensive began Jan. 31, followed six weeks later by the
My Lai massacre, followed by Johnson's stunning announcement that
he would not seek re-election. Four days later, in Memphis, Tenn.,
Martin Luther King was killed. And between the end of classes and
commencement, so was Bobby Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell things were beginning to fall apart our senior
year,'' said Douglas Little, who was in Bush's class. ``This was
not a great time to graduate.''
</P>
<P>
   If political ambition beat in George W. Bush's breast at Yale,
it was well-concealed. Everybody knew where George Pataki _ the
future governor of New York who was a year ahead of Bush _ was
heading. Plenty of outlets were available for politically inclined
students. But George's passions, despite his father's political
proclivities, were sports and beer. And fighter jets.

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   ... And fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the Reserves
</P>
<P>
   The document is on Air Force letterhead, dated 7 October 1968.
``The Secretary of the Air Force has directed me to inform you
that, by direction of the President, you are tendered an indefinite
term appointment as a Reserve officer of the Air Force.''
</P>
<P>
   He trained until June 1970, then assumed reserve status in the
Texas Air National Guard, flying F-102 fighters out of Ellington
Air Force Base. George W. Bush was 23, a first lieutenant and
thoroughly a hotshot. He was also the son of U.S. Rep. George Bush,
who was again aiming to snatch a Senate seat away from Ralph
Yarborough. (Democrat Lloyd Bentsen would knock Yarborough out in
the primary, then defeat Bush.)
</P>
<P>
   George W. was a commendable pilot, according to his service
record, and he liked it, according to a Texas Air National Guard
press release that began: ``George Walker Bush is one member of the
younger generation who doesn't get his kicks from pot or hashish or
speed. Oh, he gets high, all right, but not from narcotics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fighters are it,'' Bush was quoted as saying. ``I've always
wanted to be a fighter pilot and I wouldn't want to fly anything
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Young men were getting very creative in handling the Vietnam
problem. Hockey saved Jack Morrison, Bush's friend from Andover and
Yale. He made the 1968 Olympic team, and the powers that be decided
he'd be better off doing battle on the ice rather than in the rice
paddies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the things that makes me a little uncomfortable,''
said Morrison, who served in a reserve unit. ``I sometimes feel I
should have gone to Vietnam. Because I happened to be a good hockey
player, I was able to avoid that. At the time I was delighted _ I'd
just married and had a young child, so I didn't especially want to
go get shot at. And I think George may feel the same way a little
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   That's as close as we'll probably get to how Bush feels about
Vietnam. Bush has said he did not join the Guard to avoid service
in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush requested a discharge from the Texas Air National
Guard on 5 Sept. 73. It was approved a day later, and he was off to
Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   To the Oil Patch Born: Boom and Arbusto
</P>
<P>
   The corporate path was not the way for George W. Bush. He was
young, he was cocky, and he'd had a pretty good independent streak
inculcated into him. He went back to Midland. And when he saw
opportunity, he impulsively went after it: He surprised a number of
friends when he ran for Congress in '78.
</P>
<P>
   His opponent, then-Democrat Kent Hance, had great fun with
Bush's pedigree and Ivy League book learnin' _ and thereafter Bush
threw himself into the oil business. He'd gone to see his dad's
friend, Martin Allday, who told him his high-priced Harvard MBA had
some holes in it _ he needed to learn the ways of the land man,
chasing titles and mineral leases and chatting up the clerks in
county courthouses. His father's company had been called Zapata, so
Bush continued the tradition by starting Arbusto, Spanish for
``bush'' and pronounced ``Ar-BOOST-o.'' As in common in the oil
business, Bush was gambling with other people's money besides his
own: His Wall Street-connected uncle had lined up a stable of
wealthy investors willing to take a chance on the novice
entrepreneur. But the infrequent success of the company soon had
local wits calling the concern Ar-BUST-o, and Bush changed the name
to the more pedestrian but less easily ridiculed Bush Exploration.
</P>
<P>
   He still had that stunning capacity for remembering names and
faces. And he remembered more than the names and faces of people
who could help him. He knew the cleaning lady at the office and the
booth attendant at the parking garage and the Odessa roughnecks on
the rigs. He knew everybody, got along with everybody and wasn't
running for anything.
</P>
<P>
   The mergers continued, like little Russian nesting dolls getting
gobbled by the next one. In 1984, Bush Exploration folded into
Spectrum 7 Energy Corp., of Cincinnati, Ohio, and Midland. The move
also established a baseball connection that would in little more
than a decade lead to a big payday for George W. Bush: Spectrum
included William DeWitt Jr., the son of the owner who had built the
Cincinnati Reds into the Big Red Machine.
</P>
<P>
   Although beginning to move in tonier circles, Bush was never
what you'd call a GQ type _ if it matched, it was a miracle. Some
of the boys in Midland had a golf tournament every year, and the
gag prize for the worst-dressed contestant was prime selections
from the George W. Bush wardrobe, polyester pants and a selection
of shirts. Bob Blake in Lubbock dragged Bush into Malouf's Fine
Apparel for Men and Women, the finest clothier there, and bought
him his running-for-Congress suit. An uncle in St. Louis would send
him his discarded shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very frugal,'' said Charles Younger, an M.D. from
Midland who returned about the same time as Bush and Don Evans, now
Bush's campaign finance director. ``He never spent any money. He
was perfectly content in a pair of Levi's and a T-shirt and an old
pair of Chinese house slippers he wore everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   He had one dark suit, which he wore to out-of-town meetings up
East with Spectrum geologist Paul Rea. One morning he's supposed to
meet Rea at the airport before dawn and they're going to catch a
flight somewhere. Bush is late, flying out the door, leaps into his
old Buick and takes off and drives into D Street, which happens to
be full of water, which is pretty much what happens on D Street in
Midland when it rains, because in Midland, when it rains, it
floods, but the sun isn't up and George is in quite a rush, and
here he is with a flooded old Buick. Water's so high he can't even
open the driver's door, and anyway that'd flood the interior. So
Bush rolls down the window and strips to his skivs _ boxers, for
those keeping score _ climbs out the window, wades through the
street and starts running back to his house, past the residence of
an early-rising bank president, who chances to begin his day by
observing young George dashing along in his underwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's impulsive, impatient,'' Younger said. ``He's a man of
action. He's not gonna sit there.''
</P>
<P>
   And he ran hard. Evans and Bush would meet at Younger's office
for noon runs _ not terribly long, maybe three or four miles, but
grueling. When Bush set the pace, the three of them did six-minute
miles. Maybe 6 1/2 minutes if George took pity. ``Lord, he was
brutal,'' Younger said. ``We kept up with him for a few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Carousing? In West Texas? Sure. Miller Lite was the default
adult beverage. He and some friends would head over to the Hector
County Coliseum in Odessa to catch Willie or whoever was passing
through. Rea, his companion on innumerable business trips, never
saw him drunk. Younger saw him pretty close.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would always stay within boundaries, but he'd get on the
edge,'' Younger said.
</P>
<P>
   It messes up the conventional arc of the George W. Bush story _
from unredeemable cad to born-again moral leader _ but during these
purported lost years he was also reading the Bible daily and
attending a businessmen's Bible study group. And when colleague K.
Michael Conaway's wife was dying of leukemia _ the same disease
that had killed Bush's sister three decades earlier _ George W.
would come and take the Conaways' two young sons to baseball games.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, friends and associates from the Midland days
suggest that the elder Bush, by then the vice president of the
United States, wasn't always delighted with the way the first son
conducted himself. Which is to say nothing of what his mother
thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there were times they'd rather he maybe bit his tongue
or zipped his mouth,'' Younger said. ``He's just stay right out
there on the edge. He'd never hop over, but he'd lean over.
Mischievous.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also, let us not forget, Midland's most eligible
bachelor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He rarely dated,'' said Joe O'Neill, a friend since preschool.
``He was an early-riser, party-pooper kind of date.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Younger: ``I doubt if he ever took a girl out more than
three or four times other than Laura. I don't think there was
anybody who caught his attention, to be honest with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Rea and his wife had the cream of Midland's bachelorettes come
to the house to meet Bush: ``There were a lot of ladies here who
wanted to date George,'' he said, ``but I don't think he had a real
girlfriend until he met Laura.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, boy, did he have a girlfriend. The cockiness throttled
way back when he was around Laura, and George W. Bush seemed almost
. . . reserved. They were engaged five weeks after they met, and
married in the First Methodist Church in downtown Midland, Laura's
family church _ right in the middle of W.'s run for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Laura, a calming influence on all those around her, did some
inculcating. George was the same old George, just not cranked all
the way up.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, with the mid-'80s bust looming, Rea and Bush
made a deal to merge Spectrum 7 into Harken Energy Corp. Rea struck
out on his own; Bush, who had a 13.6 percent interest in Spectrum,
didn't get a position with Harken, but he got a chunk of stock and
a seat on the board. Of Spectrum's 15 employees, Harken hired only
one, a land man. George W. Bush went out and found jobs for the
other 12.
</P>
<P>
   The Recrafting
</P>
<P>
   The Oxford English Dictionary, second edition, defines
``inculcate'' thus: ``To endeavor to force (a thing) into or
impress (it) on the mind of another by emphatic admonition, or by
persistent repetition; to urge on the mind, esp. as a principle, an
opinion, or a matter of belief; to teach forcibly.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine this inculcation of the need to serve, this (by
definition) learned behavior, has developed, over successive
generations of Bushes, a genetic component, something George W.
inherited just as he inherited the grin and the eyebrows from
preceding generations. Imagine that this trait is like any other
genetic propensity. At some point in one's life, say on a blurry
morning after a man's 40th birthday party, a switch flips, cells
begin dividing and before long a fully inculcated George W. Bush
emerges as The Son Who Will Serve the Father, a Sonny Corleone type
whose volatility sometimes gets the best of his judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for the inculcation, he may well have stayed in
Midland, continuing his modestly successful business career. But he
answered the call, and a newer, more mature George W. Bush emerged.
</P>
<P>
   He'd quit drinking. Just. Quit. Maybe it wouldn't be an issue if
he hadn't stopped (damned if you drink, damned if you don't),
because Americans find an irresistible mystery in people who drink,
then stop. We think, What else ya got in there?
</P>
<P>
   He helped his dad get elected _ sometimes he was the last person
George Bush consulted before he made a move. George W. went to
Washington to protect his dad and terrorize his enemies. Think a
nice Ivy League boy doesn't have the stuff to get up close like
this and _ bada-bing! _ pull the trigger on John Sununu? Dubya did.
</P>
<P>
   Rough around the edges? Yes and no. Somebody was dressing him
better, but Bush still had plenty of Midland in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was working for him in '87, he was still chewing
tobacco, which is a pretty gross trait,'' said Deborah Dunn, who
worked for two years as Bush's assistant before becoming director
of the White House Visitors Office and, later, helping run George
W.'s upset of Ann Richards. ``I'd bring in his campaign itinerary,
and stacks of material I'd already sorted through. He didn't want
excessive detail. And by noon, three-quarters of the stuff would be
in the trash can. And here he was chewing tobacco and spitting in
the trash can, and when he'd go for his noon jog I'd be picking the
stuff out of the trash can and I'd think, `You couldn't have read
this.' But he had, and picked out the facts and put it somewhere in
his mind and moved on.''
</P>
<P>
   Blustery? Nothing like that doomed bulldog, Lee Atwater, but
sure. Baby-sitting Atwater, in fact, was W.'s job for a time:
``Skeptical in nature, blunt to a fault, Junior was contemptuous of
haughty D.C. insiders,'' John Brady wrote in ``Bad Boy,'' his
Atwater bio. Yes, George W. had a way of making sure no ego soared
too high on that campaign. He ruffled some feathers. Could be a
hothead. Came off cocky and brash. But remember the '88 convention?
Seemed like half the delegates in the hall were Bushes, but it was
George W. who gave Texas to the old man, thereby giving the old man
the nomination. A great dynastic moment, that.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Younger: ``I think he felt responsibility. That was part
of his maturing and I think he sensed he was the oldest son, and
when his father became president, I think his role changed. I think
he assumed responsibilities within the family and without. He
decided he was going to be a devoted son, not that he wasn't
before, and he was going to step up to the plate and be on board
with his dad and mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe O'Neill: ``He got a real taste of the power and what you can
do. It raised his horizons.''
</P>
<P>
   The Natural
</P>
<P>
   He loved baseball _ always said he wanted to play like Willie
Mays when he was a younger man. And after he and Laura and the
girls moved to Dallas, darned if he didn't get in the middle of a
deal to buy the Texas Rangers. He put up $606,000 _ chump change
compared with the other partners, but he'd get 20 times that on the
back end in a few years. They make him general manager, and there
he is running the team, wearing those custom-made Rangers cowboy
boots in his seats right behind home plate. This is the best job in
the whole world for George W. Bush, who gets along with everybody,
knows the office people and the groundskeeper and the hot-dog
vendor, signs autographs and chats up fans and players. A $200,000
salary (what the president pulls down) and part ownership in the
team _ to watch baseball!
</P>
<P>
   All anybody talks about now is The Deal, one of those Byzantine
processes by which this country builds its monuments to sport. Such
deals always get a handful of people filthy rich and another
handful feeling thoroughly shafted. But they built the new
Arlington ballpark, called The Ballpark, which made the value of
the team shoot through the roof, which made George W. Bush more
money than he ever thought he'd see.
</P>
<P>
   Former Spectrum 7 partner Rea: ``George felt like to get into
politics you needed some personal money, and that was his goal _ to
make enough money where his family would be comfortable and he
wouldn't be beholden to special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   There was quiet talk of running George W. Bush against Richards
in '90 _ Richards went after Dad with that ``poor George'' riff at
the '88 convention, about how Poppy Bush was ``born with a silver
foot in his mouth.'' Oh, people loved that one, didn't they?
Wouldn't it be nice to step up and boot her out of the governor's
office? But George W. didn't run _ told Rea his mother didn't want
him to, for one thing.
</P>
<P>
   The Candidate
</P>
<P>
   When the first son did take on Richards, she let him have it.
Dubya took the jabs and kept smiling. Richards would say Bush was a
failed businessman; Bush would mourn the governor's compulsive use
of ``personal attacks.'' Richards noted Bush had never before held
elected office; Bush wore his inexperience as a badge of honor _
not having to say out loud voters might prefer him to a product of
the Travis County Democratic machine. A Richards spokesman noted
that $141 million for The Ballpark came from a sales tax boost and
city bond guarantees. Bush's flack shot back she was just playing a
``political shell game.'' Jack Morrison says his conduct in the
campaign against Richards showed maturity and clarity of purpose:
``She just savaged him, and he just killed her with kindness.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early going, nobody thought Richards was vulnerable _ she
was a star, maybe could be the first woman president, had big
contributions from Don Henley and Steven Spielberg and Willie.
Who'd Bush have in his corner_ Claytie Williams? But Bush saw
weakness, convinced Texans _ without really coming out and saying
it _ that their governor was maybe not all that nice. Even in the
early going, when he was being painted as the spoiled little
dilettante, he exuded this cockiness, like at a meet-the-staff
event where he first met future speech writer Skardon Baker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm George Bush,'' George Bush says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Skardon Baker,'' Skardon Baker says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gonna win, ya know,'' George Bush says.
</P>
<P>
   He made those young aides and volunteers believe. It was so much
fun _ going flat-out all day long, hopping from town to town on the
plane they dubbed Accountability One, writing thank-you cards to
the hosts of the previous stop as soon as it was wheels-up (a
practice learned from George H.W.), cramming for the next event
even as they hit the ground, doing everything literally on the fly.
He had a three-day rule on getting out thank-you notes, and was
adamant about it.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign had juice. ``We had more fun days than not,''
said Israel Hernandez Jr., a campaign aide who also worked for Bush
during his first term as governor.
</P>
<P>
   The weird thing was, you could tell Bush wanted to win _ he's a
competitive guy. But there was a part of him that knew the world
wouldn't end if he lost, and that gave him a certain . . .
fearlessness. Skardon Baker's father recently became a Catholic
priest, and he sees a certain parallel between his father now and
Bush then. Bush, he says, felt a guiding hand on his shoulder,
which lent the campaign a calm core amid the chaos.
</P>
<P>
   He ran every day, wherever they were. If they were in Corpus,
Shoreline Drive. Austin, Town Lake or the UT track. And he called
home from the road every day _ more than ``Hi, how are you, OK,
bye,'' but actual want-to-know-what's-going-on conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was living in Dallas, of course, as were the Bushes,
and his place got burgled and the next day he had to deal with cops
and whatnot. Candidate Bush found Hernandez and told him: ``You
know, you shouldn't have to worry about things like that. You'd
better come live with us.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, Hernandez recalls, it was like the Waltons at
bedtime:
</P>
<P>
   ``Good night, George.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good night, Laura.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good night, Barb.'' ``Good night, Jenna.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good night, Izzy.''
</P>
<P>
   Richards, meanwhile, having already learned that it was more fun
campaigning for governor than being governor, discovered
campaigning to keep the job was a lot less fun than campaigning to
win it.
</P>
<P>
   The next campaign was little more than a dry run for the Big One
_ W2K. Democrat Garry Mauro ran on a platform of putting ``Texas
Families First.'' Bush didn't need to ask, if family was so
important to Garry, a divorced father, why he couldn't hold his own
family together. Didn't have to say anything like that out loud.
Just watched Mauro sweat through a brutal summer of knocking on
doors as Gov. Bush would fly to events, acting all gubernatorial.
Nothing to it. Kill 'em with kindness.

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   ... with kindness.
</P>
<P>
   The mercurial George W.
</P>
<P>
   So when he was young and irresponsible and cocky, he was young
and irresponsible and cocky. Now he's mature and responsible and,
well, his friend and former business partner K. Michael Conaway
uses the word ``mercurial,'' meaning volatile. Hot-headed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his best efforts, it leaks out sometimes publicly.
Reporters often don't finish asking their questions before he
starts answering them, but if a reporter steps on one of his
answers, Bush is likely to lower his head and politely seethe,
``May I finish, please?'' He's like this privately, too; his allies
say it's because he's so well-prepared and moves so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the time when a bunch of Canadian reporters were
whining about the planned execution of one of their own, Joseph
Stanley Faulder. When Bush was asked what he would say to the
charge that Texas' enthusiastic application of the needle gave the
state a sort of Wild West air, the governor let fly, ``If you're
Canadian and you come to our state, don't murder anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   He's tamped down that habit of launching strategic zingers, but
the noncampaign will be a long one. At some point, the Lip will
prevail.
</P>
<P>
   He does not suffer fools. He has little time for dissent, and
none whatsoever for disloyalty. He was the loyalty enforcer for his
dad and has continued, as governor, to demand tributes from his
allies, who are expected to cough up money and salute smartly.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's the characterization of Tom Pauken, a onetime
state Republican chairman whose run for attorney general was
derailed by Bush loyalists _ and one of few Texas Republicans
publicly critical of the popular governor.
</P>
<P>
   True, Pauken is a conservative Christian whose ideological tent
wasn't big enough for a Republican like George W. Bush _ the kind
who can win elections. But the conflict seemed to him at its root
personal: Pauken didn't support George Bush in his '88 run for
president, and George W. ``expressed his disappointment with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years later Bush was governor and in a position to once
again express his disappointment with Pauken, which he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're supposed to salute,'' he said. ``If you don't salute
you're an opponent. And Karl Rove, the political genius of the Bush
operation, is very single-minded as far as making anybody pay a
price who's not 100 percent on board.''
</P>
<P>
   Pauken's Machiavellian interpretation of the Rove-Bush dynamic
is a popular one: Rove is the mechanic, this reading goes; Bush is
simply pointed in the right direction and instructed to flash that
big, famous mug _ George W. Bush as anti-wonk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't know what moves the governor,'' Pauken said.
</P>
<P>
   So why's he running?
</P>
<P>
   Pauken: ``I guess to follow Bill Clinton after Clinton defeated
his father would prove something.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeling Presidential
</P>
<P>
   Before the legislative session ended Memorial Day, Bush went to
great effort to appear focused on the state's business. Before the
session began, he was a cautious man, doing the political math and
keeping the Lip on a tight leash. He even refused to state a
position on whether he would dance with Laura at the inaugural
balls. (He did.) Public appearances were tightly scripted and
usually ceremonial. He had hardly a word to say about any national
issue, and anyway he was too busy to be as available to the press
as he'd been before. Meanwhile, Republican big shots from across
the country were double-parked on the streets around the governor's
mansion, delivering gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh.
</P>
<P>
   The only flashes of spontaneity were at bill signings, where
Bush would take a few questions. He's got most of the capitol press
well-trained by now. He greets favored ones with exaggerated
deference and chummy nicknames; once, alluding to his habit of
rushing through everything, even signing his name, he joked to a TV
camerawoman, ``I understand you've requested a slow signing.''
Everybody had a nice chuckle at that one.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional arena for these episodes was the governor's
press conference room, a functional but unsexy space with bright
lights and a riser in back for the TV cameras. But on May 25, the
morning the Cox report was released, Bush's meeting with the press
was moved from there _ the previously stated location _ to the
governor's reception room next door. That room is as grand and
dignified as the press conference room is utilitarian. George W.
Bush acknowledged that the Lege was still steaming along and that
he had some time before his victory-lap-slash-summer-tour, but he
had something to say and he was going to say it in a stately
setting in front of the gathered TV cameras and it was this:
</P>
<P>
   He was firmly opposed to China stealing American nuclear
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The Assumption of George W. Bush
</P>
<P>
   ``Inculcate'' comes from the Latin inculcatus, meaning to tread
down or trample underfoot. It means to impress upon the mind via
frequent repetition _ the old-fashioned, rote way of learning. The
belief that the 2000 election has an inevitable conclusion _ let's
just go ahead and call it manifest destiny _ has been thoroughly
inculcated into the electorate and the media. A second President
Bush is considered a foregone conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody can catch him, the media seem to be saying, and he hasn't
even officially declared.
</P>
<P>
   All he needs to do is say so. All we need to know is who he is.
With his campaign swing through Iowa and New Hampshire beginning
last Saturday, George W. Bush took his first tentative steps, and
the process of getting to know him is under way.

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Inculcated, that was the word George Bush used.
He said he had the drive to serve inculcated into him by his
father, the future senator from Connecticut, Prescott Bush, who
believed in noblesse oblige, believed it was the solemn obligation
of the elite to serve for the greater societal good. The future
senator inculcated that belief into his second son, the future
president, George Herbert Walker Bush. That son went off to West
Texas, and he raised a family and did some inculcating of his own.
In those days, when the Kennedys reigned as American royalty, the
senior senator's son was on occasion heard to say, ``Just wait till
I turn these Bush boys out.''
</P>
<P>
   The oldest of those Bush boys _ George Dubya, as he is known in
Texas _ is poised to continue the family tradition. After months of
conspicuously not running for president, he finally made it clear
in Iowa last Saturday that he is seeking the office.
</P>
<P>
   The first election of the 21st century then, we currently
assume, may be The Clash of the Scions, Al Gore vs. George W. Bush.
One, Gore, went to Vietnam and didn't fight; the other, Bush, flew
fighter jets and didn't go to Vietnam. One toked a little pot; the
other declines to give a full accounting of his youthful
indiscretions and emphatically considers the matter closed. The
public perceives one as exuding the charisma and warmth of a cheap
Formica countertop; the other is regarded, even by his frustrated
political enemies, as impossible to personally dislike. One has
spent decades being groomed for this moment; the other has
strenuously spent at least the last year not running for president,
listening to the whole world tell him it's his to lose.
</P>
<P>
   From New Haven to Midland
</P>
<P>
   George Walker Bush was born in New Haven, Conn., on July 6,
1946.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bushes moved to Midland, Texas, in 1950, it was still a
small town. Barbara Bush gave birth to John Ellis Bush, the future
governor of Florida whom the family would call Jebbie, in February
1953. (Two other Bush boys, Marvin and Neil, as well as a daughter,
Doro, would follow.) But a family tragedy loomed, too: Pauline
Robinson Bush, George W.'s younger sister, would die of leukemia in
October before her 4th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The elder George Bush was in Houston by the time he ran for the
U.S. Senate against Ralph Yarborough in 1964. Yarborough wouldn't
debate, so Bush and his pal Martin Allday came up with the famous
empty-chair debates, with a tape recording on a chair sitting in
for Yarborough. They got a lot of mileage out of that, but LBJ was
in the White House by then and his coattails stretched from El Paso
to Nacogdoches.
</P>
<P>
   Young George W., when home on break from Andover, sat in on
strategy meetings. And on election night, in the Houston ballroom
his dad had rented for the victory reception that never happened,
young George W. wept.
</P>
<P>
   George W. went to prep school in Massachusetts. He enrolled in
Phillips Academy, which sits atop a long, gradual hill stretching
through Andover. Think of one of those perennially autumnal places,
hundreds of acres of trees and brick and scowling faculty who are
addressed as ``sir.''
</P>
<P>
   Morning chapel was mandatory, as was jacket and tie. The class
work was unrelenting. Fear, intimidation and humiliation were
trusted teaching tools.
</P>
<P>
   Also, no girls. The educational wisdom of the day maintained
that a boy could not have a top-notch education bludgeoned _
inculcated _ into him while in the agitating presence of the fair
sex.
</P>
<P>
   Young George was a social creature, one who went out of his way
to make everybody comfortable. It was here that Bush honed an
essential political skill: getting along with everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Bush roommate John Kidde: ``George and I played sports _ I
played a lot of sports _ and there are some kids at Andover who are
not very outgoing or socially dialed-in, nerds or whatever you want
to call them. I remember two or three of us would be getting lunch
and there'd be Joe Blow, one of the straight-A students who never
talked and nobody socialized with him, and we'd sit down and start
talking and George would make a joke or a comment and always bring
this guy into the conversation, make him a part of the group. He
was real good at that. He always made people feel very comfortable
around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his kind nature, Bush was known as ``Lip'' for his
lightning wit.
</P>
<P>
   ``George was quick with a quip,'' said Jack Morrison, a close
friend from Andover and Yale. ``He always had a twinkle in his eye
and a ready retort in his mouth. He often got the last word in.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior year was when boys found whether they were going to their
first-choice college. Like the old man, George W. Bush was going to
Yale.
</P>
<P>
   The summer of '68
</P>
<P>
   At Yale, where he would earn a degree in history, they all
seemed to love George W. Everybody except John Lincoln, who lived
across the hall from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``George was a member of Deke, the fraternity known to be the
drinking fraternity,'' Lincoln said. Nor did Lincoln, a computer
graphic artist, find the younger Bush's intellect to be formidable.
When word of Bush's White House ambition got out, ``I said to
myself, `You know, he's not all that smart.' Which is maybe what
the job takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and the boys let the good times roll, Morrison says: ``The
things I remember are the times we would go on road trips and just
be weak with laughter,'' said Morrison, a partner in a private
investment firm in Minneapolis. ``We'd pile into a car and head off
to some girls' school up north. Never really got in any serious
trouble at all, but came close a couple of times. There were a
couple of times when you could say we probably consumed more than
we should have, but nothing terribly serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, out in the world, everything was out of the ordinary.
Vietnam, or how to avoid it, was the topic of every other
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   If political ambition beat in George W. Bush's breast at Yale,
it was well-concealed. George's passions, despite his father's
political proclivities, were sports and beer. And fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the Reserves
</P>
<P>
   The document is on Air Force letterhead, dated 7 October 1968.
``The Secretary of the Air Force has directed me to inform you
that, by direction of the President, you are tendered an indefinite
term appointment as a Reserve officer of the Air Force.''
</P>
<P>
   He trained until June 1970, then assumed reserve status in the
Texas Air National Guard, flying F-102 fighters out of Ellington
Air Force Base. George W. Bush was 23, a first lieutenant and a
hotshot.
</P>
<P>
   Young men were getting creative in handling the Vietnam problem.
Hockey saved Morrison. He made the 1968 Olympic team, and the
powers that be decided he'd be better off doing battle on the ice
rather than in the rice paddies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the things that makes me a little uncomfortable,''
said Morrison, who served in a reserve unit. ``I sometimes feel I
should have gone to Vietnam. Because I happened to be a good hockey
player, I was able to avoid that. At the time I was delighted _ I'd
just married and had a young child, so I didn't especially want to
go get shot at. And I think George may feel the same way a little
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   That's probably as close as we'll get to how Bush feels about
Vietnam. Bush has said he did not join the Guard to avoid service
in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush requested a discharge from the Texas Air National
Guard on 5 Sept. 73. It was approved a day later, and he was off to
Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   To the oil patch born
</P>
<P>
   Despite his newly minted MBA, the corporate path was not the way
for George W. Bush. He was young, he was cocky, and he'd had a
pretty good independent streak inculcated into him. He went back to
Midland. And when he saw opportunity, he impulsively went after it:
He surprised a number of friends when he ran for Congress in '78.
</P>
<P>
   His opponent, then-Democrat Kent Hance, had big fun with Bush's
pedigree and Ivy League book learnin' _ and thereafter Bush threw
himself into the oil business. His father's company had been called
Zapata, so Bush continued the tradition by starting Arbusto,
Spanish for ``bush'' and pronounced ``Ar-BOOST-o.'' But the
infrequent success of the company soon had locals calling the
company Ar-BUST-o, and Bush changed the name to the more pedestrian
but less easily ridiculed Bush Exploration.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Bush Exploration folded into Spectrum 7 Energy Corp.,
of Cincinnati, Ohio, and Midland. The move also established a
baseball connection that would in little more than a decade lead to
a big payday for George W. Bush: Spectrum included William DeWitt
Jr., the son of the owner who had built the Cincinnati Reds into
the Big Red Machine.
</P>
<P>
   Although beginning to move in tonier circles, Bush was never
what you'd call a GQ type _ if it matched, it was a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very frugal,'' said Charles Younger, a doctor from
Midland who returned about the same time as Don Evans, now Bush's
campaign finance director. ``He never spent any money. He was
perfectly content in a pair of Levi's and a T-shirt and an old pair
of Chinese house slippers he wore everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   He had one dark suit, which he wore to out-of-town meetings up
East with Spectrum geologist Paul Rea. One morning he was supposed
to meet Rea at the airport before dawn. Bush is late, flies out the
door, leaps into his old Buick and takes off and drives into D
Street, which happens to be full of water. The water's so high he
can't even open the driver's door. So Bush rolls down the window
and strips to his boxers, climbs out the window, wades through the
street and starts running back to his house, past the residence of
an early-rising bank president, who chances to begin his day by
observing young George dashing along in his underwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's impulsive, impatient,'' Younger said. ``He's a man of
action. He's not gonna sit there.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, friends and associates from the Midland days
suggest that the elder Bush, by then the vice president of the
United States, wasn't always delighted with the way the younger
Bush conducted himself. Which is to say nothing of what his mother
thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there were times they'd rather he maybe bit his tongue
or zipped his mouth,'' Younger said. ``He'd just stay right out
there on the edge. He'd never hop over, but he'd lean over.
Mischievous.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also, let us not forget, Midland's most eligible
bachelor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He rarely dated,'' said Joe O'Neill, a friend since preschool.
``He was an early-riser, party-pooper kind of date.''
</P>
<P>
   Younger: ``I doubt if he ever took a girl out more than three or
four times other than Laura. I don't think there was anybody who
caught his attention, to be honest with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Catch his attention she did. The cockiness throttled way back
when he was around Laura, and George W. Bush seemed almost . . .
reserved. They were engaged five weeks after they met, and married
in the First Methodist Church in downtown Midland, Laura's family
church _ right in the middle of W.'s run for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Laura, a calming influence on all those around her, did some
inculcating. George was the same old George, just not cranked all
the way up.
</P>
<P>
   The recrafting
</P>
<P>
   The Oxford English Dictionary, second edition, defines
``inculcate'' thus: ``To endeavor to force (a thing) into or
impress (it) on the mind of another by emphatic admonition, or by
persistent repetition; to urge on the mind, esp. as a principle, an
opinion, or a matter of belief; to teach forcibly.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine this inculcation of the need to serve, something George
W. inherited just as he inherited the grin and the eyebrows from
preceding generations. Imagine that this trait is like any other
genetic propensity. At some point in one's life, a switch flips,
cells begin dividing and before long a fully inculcated George W.
Bush emerges as The Son Who Will Serve the Father, a Sonny Corleone
type whose volatility sometimes gets the best of his judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for the inculcation, he may well have stayed in
Midland, continuing his modestly successful business career. But he
answered the call, and a newer, more mature George W. Bush emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Rough around the edges? Yes and no. Somebody was dressing him
better, but Bush still had plenty of Midland in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was working for him in '87, he was still chewing
tobacco, which is a pretty gross trait,'' said Deborah Dunn, who
worked for two years as Bush's assistant before becoming director
of the White House Visitors Office and, later, helping run George
W.'s upset of Ann Richards. ``I'd bring in his campaign itinerary,
and stacks of material I'd already sorted through. He didn't want
excessive detail. And by noon, three-quarters of the stuff would be
in the trash can. And here he was chewing tobacco and spitting in
the trash can, and when he'd go for his noon jog I'd be picking the
stuff out of the trash can and I'd think, `You couldn't have read
this.' But he had, and picked out the facts and put it somewhere in
his mind and moved on.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember the '88 convention? It seemed like half the delegates
in the hall were Bushes, but it was George W. who gave Texas to the
old man, thereby giving the old man the nomination. A great
dynastic moment.
</P>
<P>
   The Natural
</P>
<P>
   He loved baseball _ always said he wanted to play like Willie
Mays when he was a younger man. After he and Laura and the girls
moved to Dallas, darned if he didn't jump in on a deal to buy the
Texas Rangers. He put up $606,000 _ chump change compared with the
other partners _ but he'd get 20 times that on the back end in a
few years. They make him general manager, and there he is running
the team. This is the best job in the whole world for George W.
Bush, who gets along with everybody, knows the office people and
the groundskeeper and the hot-dog vendor, signs autographs and
chats up fans and players. A $200,000 salary (what the president
pulls down) and part ownership in the team _ to watch baseball!
</P>
<P>
   Former Spectrum 7 partner Rea: ``George felt like to get into
politics you needed some personal money, and that was his goal _ to
make enough money where his family would be comfortable and he
wouldn't be beholden to special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   There was quiet talk of running George W. Bush against Richards
in '90 _ Richards went after Dad with that ``poor George'' riff at
the '88 convention, about how ``Poppy'' Bush was ``born with a
silver foot in his mouth.'' Wouldn't it be nice to step up and boot
her out of the governor's office? But George W. didn't run _ told
Rea his mother didn't want him to, for one thing.
</P>
<P>
   When the first son did take on Richards, in '94, she let him
have it. Dubya took the jabs and kept smiling. Richards would say
Bush was a failed businessman; Bush would mourn the governor's
compulsive use of ``personal attacks.'' Richards noted Bush had
never before held elected office; Bush wore his inexperience as a
badge of honor. Morrison says Bush's conduct in the campaign
against Richards showed maturity and clarity of purpose: ``She just
savaged him, and he just killed her with kindness.''
</P>
<P>
   So when he was young and irresponsible and cocky, he was young
and irresponsible and cocky. Now he's mature and responsible and,
well, his friend and former business partner K. Michael Conaway
uses the word ``mercurial,'' meaning volatile. Hot-headed.
</P>
<P>
   He does not suffer fools. He has little time for dissent, and
none whatsoever for disloyalty. He was the loyalty enforcer for his
dad and has continued, as governor, to demand tributes from his
allies, who are expected to cough up money and salute smartly.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's the characterization of Tom Pauken, a onetime
state Republican chairman whose run for attorney general was
derailed by Bush loyalists _ and one of the few Texas Republicans
publicly critical of the popular governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't know what moves the governor,'' Pauken said.
</P>
<P>
   So why's he running?
</P>
<P>
   Pauken: ``I guess to follow Bill Clinton after Clinton defeated
his father would prove something.''
</P>
<P>
   The assumption of George W. Bush
</P>
<P>
   A second President Bush seems to be a foregone conclusion. The
belief that the 2000 election has an inevitable conclusion _ let's
just go ahead and call it manifest destiny _ has been thoroughly
inculcated into the electorate and the media.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody can catch him, the media seem to be saying, and he hasn't
even officially declared.
</P>
<P>
   All he needs to do is say so. All we need to know is who he is.
With his campaign swing through Iowa and New Hampshire this month,
George W. Bush took his first tentative steps, and the process of
getting to know him is under way.

 &HT;    Black Seminoles: 2 cultures forged new life in Texas
 &HT;    By Norma Martin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It was an archaeological project in a South
Texas town that led University of Texas anthropologist Shirley Mock
to a little-known community.
</P>
<P>
   A golf course and houses were being planned in a section of
Brackettville, but before construction could start, the land had to
be excavated excavation for any culturally significant items. And
as part of the project, Mock was hired to interview the older
people who lived near the site. Those initial talks led to more
in-depth ethnological interviews and years of research into the
black Seminoles of Texas and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Singing to the Ancestors: Black Seminoles on the Border'' is
the culmination of Mock's five-year scholarly investigation. The
multimedia exhibit explores the search for freedom and the building
of a culture among a group that formed in the early 1800s, when
runaway slaves took shelter with the Seminole Indians in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the black Seminoles _ the descendants of those
African slaves and the Seminoles _ moved to Oklahoma along with
other Native American tribes as part of the historic Trail of
Tears. But slave bounty hunters were a constant threat forto the
group, and its members headed for Mexico by way of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of them crossed the Rio Grande and that's where Mock, an
anthropologist at the Institute of Texan Cultures, picked up their
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not aware of them being in Texas, but I knew they had a
story that had not been told,'' said Mock, who paid for her
research in South Texas and northern Mexico with a variety of
grants. ``They are forged by the ethnic diversity of their
background and bound together by their dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Many black Seminoles came to Texas as scouts for the U.S. Army
and became legends in Texas and American history for their skills.
But when the land treaties between the United States and Native
American nations were signed, the black Seminoles didn't get the
one they'd been promised, said Mock.
</P>
<P>
   Some went to Mexico to ranch and farm. Others became cowboys,
domestics and migrant workers working in Texas and throughout the
West.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit combines video footage and photographs to tell the
black Seminole story in Texas and Mexico. Mock said she wanted the
black Seminoles to describe their history, traditions and culture
themselves. In part of the video, the group's elders speak in what
they call the ``broken language,'' said Mock. They speak a form of
Gullah, which has Creole origins and uses English, African, Spanish
and Native American words.
</P>
<P>
   Like their language, the black Seminoles' religious traditions
are a blend of their cultural influences. ``They are a very
spiritual people,'' said Mock. One of their most honored religious
traditions is elder women who are called ``dream readers'' _ a
person's dreams and their meaning were taken very seriously among
the black Seminoles, Mock said.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the richness of the black Seminole culture, it is
dying out, said Mock. The language is only spoken by the oldest
elders.

 &HT;    Florida's 'Crime of the Century': More than just a murder story
 &HT;    By Michael Browning
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The voice of the murdered man can be
heard today, rising as if from the very depths of the silent ocean.
What are perhaps the victim's last written words are hastily
scribbled in pencil, on the back of a legal brief, which lies this
morning on a table under lamplight at the Palm Beach Historical
Society.
</P>
<P>
   It is the voice of Judge C.E. Chillingworth, abducted with his
wife 44 years ago, June 15, 1955, from a seaside bungalow in
Manalapan. The judge, 58, and his wife, Marjorie, 47, were bound,
weighted and forced overboard, alive, two miles out to sea, by two
assassins hired by a fellow judge who hated and feared
Chillingworth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the crime of the century, at least as far as Palm Beach
County is concerned,'' said Clemmer Mayhew III, archivist at the
Historical Society of Palm Beach County. ``But for us, it's more
than just a crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Chillingworth was our founding president. He served for
more than a dozen years. His father was the first sheriff and the
first judge in the county, and his grandfather was a pioneer here.
The Chillingworths were Palm Beach County. They were the
cornerstone. There is much more to his life than his death.''
</P>
<P>
   With this in mind, Mayhew wrote last month to Chillingworth's
daughter, Anne Wright, who lives in Gainesville, asking if she had
any material on her father she would be willing to donate to the
historical society.
</P>
<P>
   He struck gold. Wright sent a large box of material, including
voluminous clippings about the case, a family scrapbook going back
to World War I, family portraits and, most fascinating of all, a
scribbled pencil note on the back of a legal brief in which Judge
Chillingworth announces his desire to retire from the bench on June
16, 1955 _ the very day after he was murdered. The draft is
addressed to then-Florida governor Leroy Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The date appears to be erased and changed to July 1, why we
don't know, but it's a fascinating document,'' Mayhew said. ``It
shows the judge was plainly planning to retire. If the men who
killed him had known this, it might have saved his life. Who knows?
These may be the last words the judge ever wrote.''
</P>
<P>
   The draft reads:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Governor Collins:
</P>
<P>
   ``For over thirty-four years, I have served as a Judge, the last
thirty two years as a Judge of the Circuit Court of the Fifteenth
Judicial Circuit of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of my health and for several reasons, I feel I should
retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having in 1939, elected to take the benefits of F.S. 38.14 and
since then complied with FS 38.17, I now elect to retire, with
compensation, as a Circuit Judge, under existing law and Florida
Constitution Article V Section 49 (46), the retirement to be
effective 16 (erasure) July 1, 1955.
</P>
<P>
   ``With my respect and best wishes, I remain, Sincerely Yours.''
</P>
<P>
   There follows a short annotation, saying a signed copy is to go
to the state comptroller, then another instructional memo at the
bottom of the page:
</P>
<P>
   ``Before sending letter _ correspond with (comptroller) Gay to
ascertain whether $10416.66 per annum will be available etc.''
</P>
<P>
   The erased date is intriguing _ Mayhew says Chillingworth might
very well have written 16 June first, as he was first appointed a
circuit judge on June 15, 1923. The number 16 seems to ghost
through the erasure. In any case, he was plainly planning to step
down from the bench in mid-summer 1955.
</P>
<P>
   ``June 15 is a date that echoes throughout his life,'' Mayhew
observed. ``He was appointed judge on June 15, and he was murdered
on June 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``JUDGE CHILLINGWORTH, WIFE, BELIEVED KIDNAP VICTIMS,'' screamed
The Palm Beach Times in its June 16 afternoon edition, the day the
judge and his wife were discovered missing by a handyman at the
Manalapan cottage. Papers all over the state picked up the story,
and the front pages can still be read in the historical society's
archives:
</P>
<P>
   ``SUSPECTS CHECKED AS HUNT FOR CHILLINGWORTH WIDENS'' (June 16).
</P>
<P>
   ``JUDGE AND WIFE BELIEVED ALIVE'' (June 17).
</P>
<P>
   ``CHILLINGWORTH CASE REACHES DEAD END'' (June 20).
</P>
<P>
   ``$113,000 REWARD'' (June 21).
</P>
<P>
   ``FATE OF JUDGE, MRS. CHILLINGWORTH, CONTINUES MYSTERY'' (June
23).
</P>
<P>
   Years passed. In 1959 the Florida legislature voted to keep the
$100,000 reward it had earlier voted on the books ``for eternity''
or until the case was solved. Finally, after five years, it was.
The solution proved nearly as shocking as the crime itself.
</P>
<P>
   Chillingworth had been ordered killed by a fellow judge, Joe
Peel Jr., who served on the municipal court bench and who was
suspected of shady dealings with moonshiners and bolita racketeers.
</P>
<P>
   Peel was due to appear before Chillingworth on charges of sloppy
law practice. Two divorce cases he handled as a private attorney
had been bungled badly. Peel also had ties to a hoodlum named Floyd
``Lucky'' Holzapfel, who had been in and out of trouble for years
and was hiding in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   One of Holzapfel's buddies, insurance agent James Yenzer, told
police Holzapfel had boasted to him he knew who had killed the
Chillingworths. Yenzer volunteered to lure Holzapfel back to the
U.S. and get him to talk about his crimes into a hidden microphone.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme worked. Yenzer lured Holzapfel to room 127 of the
Holiday Inn in Melbourne where, during a three-day drinking binge,
Holzapfel gradually revealed details of the murders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, there's a hole out there in the ocean nobody's found the
bottom of,'' Holzapfel said darkly. Everything he said was recorded
by agent Henry Lovern of the Florida Sheriff's Bureau, on 30 reels
of tape. Lovern was sitting next door in room 129.
</P>
<P>
   Most damning of all, Holzapfel named his accomplice, Bobby
Lincoln, a black man from Riviera Beach who was serving time in a
federal prison for moonshining. Lincoln had run a numbers racket in
Palm Beach County at the time of the murders.
</P>
<P>
   Persuaded to talk in exchange for immunity from all prosecution,
Lincoln finally revealed exactly what had happened in Manalapan on
the night of June 15, 1955. Confronted with Lincoln's story,
Holzapfel broke down and confessed, too. Hearing of their
confessions, Peel fled to Tennessee where he was arrested in
Chattanooga.
</P>
<P>
   The two killers told how, in exchange for $2,500 from Judge
Peel, they had bought a boat and weighed anchor at the Blue Heron
Docks in Riviera Beach and had come ashore right outside the
judge's cottage. There they knocked on the door. The judge
answered, clad in his pajamas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked the man, `Aren't you Judge Chillingworth?' and he
answered, `Yes, I am.' I immediately drew the pistol from under my
shirt and said, `This is a holdup.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The hitmen tied the couple up with tape and marched them across
the empty beach. The nearest neighbor was 700 yards distant.
Marjorie Chillingworth screamed. Lincoln hit her on the head with
his gun, opening a gash. Droplets of her blood were found on the
sand by bloodhounds the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   Two miles offshore, in the Gulf Stream, Holzapfel cut the motor.
The judge tried to bargain for the couple's lives, promising
Lincoln he would ``never have to work again'' if he let them go.
</P>
<P>
   But he may have made a fatal mistake. He addressed Lincoln as
``boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln and Holzapfel then strapped weighted army web-belts onto
Mrs. Chillingworth. The doomed couple's last words to each other
were, ``I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Ladies first,' and pushed her in,'' Holzapfel
testified later. ``She went down with a few bubbles.''
</P>
<P>
   Weighted with a boat anchor, Chillingworth jumped of his own
accord. A Navy veteran and a graduate of Annapolis, he swam
strongly, keeping his head above water despite the anchor, despite
being bound. Lincoln leaned over the side of the boat and smashed
the stock of a shotgun on the judge's head. Chillingworth finally
sank.
</P>
<P>
   Peel was tried first. Holzapfel testified the judge had told
him: ``There's a man who is trying to mess up our business and I
want to kill him.'' The former judge got off with a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``PEEL GUILTY BUT CHEATS CHAIR,'' The Palm Beach Post announced.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln had immunity. Holzapfel cooperated fully, hoping to
escape the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   State attorney Phil O'Connell demanded it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ghost of Judge Chillingworth will not rest until his
killers are shoveling coal in the fires of hell and damnation,''
O'Connell told the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Russell O. Morrow agreed. ``You and your cohorts
participated in a crime or crimes which were gruesome, vicious,
cold-blooded, premeditated in design, and the likes of which the
history of Florida has not seen,'' he told Holzapfel just before
passing sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not just a man's life that was taken. It was Judge
Chillingworth that was taken ... He was a man of honor and, in a
sense, a bulwark in this county and state against the unlawful.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrow sentenced Holzapfel to death. The sentence was commuted
to life imprisonment in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Holzapfel remained in prison until his death on Oct. 12, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln went to Chicago, became a black Muslim and later
returned to Palm Beach County, where he still lives.
</P>
<P>
   Peel served 21 years behind bars, a model prisoner who attended
church regularly and worked on the prison newspaper. He was paroled
in 1982 and died nine days later of cancer. In a deathbed
interview, he said, ``There's no one to blame but myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Judge C.E. Chillingworth and Marjorie
Chillingworth were never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   An empty double grave with a twin headstone bears their names
today in the Chillingworth family plot in West Palm Beach's Oak
Lawn Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   There is a Chillingworth Drive off Okeechobee Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   And there are now boxes of material on the judge's life at the
Palm Beach Historical Society, thanks to Anne Wright's generosity
and the historical society's polite persistence.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's military career, his activities in the community,
old addresses to the Rotarians, social engagements, honors,
recognitions of service, family photographs from his boyhood
onward, hunting and fishing pictures, all are preserved now in the
society's archives _ and with them the early history of Palm Beach
County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Together with the murder clippings, they will remind people
that Chillingworth was more than a headline. He was a man,'' Mayhew
said.

 &HT;    Only in today's society....

   DAYTON, Ohio _ ``How low can you get?''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Dennis Faughn of Enon thought when he learned that
two teen-agers had robbed his 9-year-old son's lemonade stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``How low can you get?''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Detective Debby Branigan of the Butler County
Sheriff's Office thought when she heard about it. ``Here's a kid
willing to go out and work and earn his own money, and other kids
take advantage of him because they're too sorry to work,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there were a
today's-youth-is-going-to-hell-in-a-handbasket crime, this would be
it. But neither the detective's nor Aaron's faith in humanity has
been soured.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Aaron thanked me once he thanked me 10 times,'' Branigan
said. ``It makes me remember why I chose to do this job 17 years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The detective's voice mail overflowed with dozens of calls from
irate residents when she came to work Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Has any other $6 theft sparked such an outrcy?
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be it,'' Branigan said. ``People can't believe
thugs would do this to a little boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron wasn't so much heartbroken as indignant that anybody would
do this to his business partners, Jamie Curtin and Billy Holger.
``It was all of our money,'' Aaron said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon was the first day this the boys set up their
poolside lemonade stand at the Lakota Point Town Homes complex in
Butler County, where Aaron lives. (The enterprise kept them in
Pokemon cards last summer.) Around 4:30 p.m., two teen-agers pulled
up to the curbside stand in a red Chevrolet Blazer and asked for
change for $10. ``I let them count the money'' _ ruefulness creeps
into his voice _ ``and they ran off with it.'' The boys lost $6 _
enough for a pack of 11 Pokemon cards.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, the boys set up shop Friday. ``The attitude was,
'We're a business team here and nobody is going to get us down,'''
Dennis Faughn said.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron was prepared for adversity, but not, perhaps, instant
media celebrity. Now a veteran of countless TV and newspaper
interviews, he's a straight-ahead kid with the voice and manner of
one who cannot tell even a polite lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you tired of talking to reporters?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he conceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you as good and polite as Detective Branigan says you
are?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes yes and sometimes not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron garnered an important business lesson: ``Don't give people
your money; ask for their money first.'' He also learned a lot
about people: ``More people are nice than mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Take the response to the lemonade stand the boys set up Tuesday
at a nearby Kroger store. A local radio station did a live
broadcast, and some patrons paid as much as $5 or $10 for a 25-cent
cup of lemonade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to give a dollar amount for what they raised for
fear there will be a rush of lemonade stand robberies reported,''
Branigan said.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron has no such reticence. He said the sale raked in more than
$500.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in part to Aaron's keen eye for detail, two teens _ 16
and 17 _ apprehended Monday have been charged in the theft. It's
hardly the crime of the century, but it's the kind of thing that
makes folks pronounce today's kids the worst generation of
hooligans since Sodom and Gomorrah.
</P>
<P>
   I prefer to take my cue from Aaron Faughn. He has taught us it's
not enough to ask, ``How low can you get?'' about a handful of
rotten kids. He has shown us how beautifully the ordinary, everyday
kid _ the one with the lemonade stand on the corner _ can rise
above it.

 &HT;    Phoners' courtesy disconnects
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Some people I know are worried about Y2K
supplies or cellulite on their upper thighs or getting their
daughter into a good middle school. But I say these people are
self-absorbed and misguided.
</P>
<P>
   I say these people have their priorities all mixed up.
</P>
<P>
   What we all should be worrying about is the millions of
Americans who use cell phones to make calls from the most
ridiculous of places, including bathroom stalls.
</P>
<P>
   By some industry estimates, 26 new cell phone subscribers take
to the street every minute of every day so, yes, there is cause to
be afraid. But remember, these are important, busy people who are
going places, and fast.
</P>
<P>
   These are people who can actually order a pizza from the
interstate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has kind of gotten out of control,'' says businessman Emory
Rayle, 48, in town last week from Greenville, S.C. ``Sometimes I'm
driving down the road and the phone's going and the pager's going
and the radar's going off.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rayle, a true traveling salesman, says he's so much more
efficient, so much more productive, because of his cell phone. It's
made his frantic business life manageable.
</P>
<P>
   If you're thinking about traveling out of the country to escape
the rude madness, forget it. Wireless calling isn't just an
American thing. In Brazil, 1 million people await cell phone
service. So coveted is a cell phone to a Brazilian's self-image
that it has been said that some people actually walk the streets of
Rio de Janeiro talking and chuckling and scowling into a fake cell
phone. In Finland, it's estimated that by the year 2001, there will
be more cell phones than actual Finnish people, although I'm a
little confused about how that whole two-phone-per-Finn theory
works out.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some growth figures from the Cellular
Telecommunications Industry Association in Washington, D.C.:
</P>
<P>
   _ 10 years ago, 2.6 million Americans used cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1996, the number was estimated at 33 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ And today, an estimated 75 million people use cell phones _
probably at a movie theater or restaurant near you.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Nelson, the association's spokesman, explains the
industry's growth like this: In the mid-1990s the Federal
Communications Commission ``auctioned off additional wireless
licenses, PCS services and other digital . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   I'm sorry, but it was at this point that I began to hear nothing
but: blah, blah, money, blah, blah, more money, blah, money, money,
money.
</P>
<P>
   I thanked nice Mr. Nelson and hung up.
</P>
<P>
   Now, before you pick up your cell phone to call and say that I'm
the misguided one. Before you call to say that a cell phone
literally saved your life one night when you were stranded with a
busload of nuns and blind orphans on a hot, dusty road somewhere,
relax.
</P>
<P>
   I realize they're time efficient. I realize they're a business
executive's godsend. I know they're much-needed security for people
with epilepsy and diabetes and heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   But what's bothering me, what's out of control, what's downright
rude, is the way all these people are using their cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   It's like the rest of us didn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   A true story:
</P>
<P>
   There I was, using the facilities at a local restaurant, when I
heard this woman chatting away in her little stall. Now, that part
is not that unusual because when a woman is stranded without tissue
in a public restroom she will wail and scream and talk to just
about anyone who strolls in. I figure she needed help, so I shoved
a wad of white fake Charmin under the stall wall.
</P>
<P>
   No reaction, mainly because she was too busy talking to a loved
one on her wireless telephone. This was not a woman in need of
medical assistance, I can assure you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey,'' she was saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come meet me down here. I'm going to have a few beers and I'll
wait for you and. . . .'' Then, silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, don't be mad,'' she pouted. I threw my spare wad of white
tissue in the trash, and left.
</P>
<P>
   I watched her come out; recognized her from the shoes. She
walked up to the booth where she and her girlfriend were sitting.
Then her phone rang and she started to talk and then her
girlfriend's phone rang and she started to talk, too, and then they
both talked, but not to each other, and I watched the whole thing
from two booths over as though they were characters in some weird,
new MTV mini-series, ``Women who go out for beers but never speak
to one another.'' And that's when I realized we've all lost our
minds.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of cell phone manners has caught the eye of Judith
Martin, aka syndicated columnist Miss Manners, who is surprisingly
forgiving:
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who wants to work in an airplane, a hairdressing
establishment or while standing in line at the bank has Miss
Manners' blessing. The offense is not talking on the telephone,
much less in owning the equipment with which to do so. It consists
of intruding on others, or neglecting others, in order to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   I love that woman.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, the industry expert in Washington, says people are only
as polite with their cell phones as they are in other aspects of
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rude people are rude,'' Nelson says. ``And if you put a new
device in their hand with which to be rude, they'll use it.''
</P>
<P>
   But leave it to Californians to put it all in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent survey done by Pacific Bell, 60 percent of
Californians would rather go to the dentist _ the dentist! _ than
sit next to someone talking on their cell phone at the movies. I
rest my case.

 &HT;    The language of Saturday bargaining
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The yard sale begins at 8, but three
women dressed in cottony bright island colors show up before 7 in
the bleakest of Toyotas. They move up the driveway, fan out like a
recon patrol, look over the merchandise, which is still being
lugged out of the garage by the bleary-eyed homeowner.
</P>
<P>
   One of the early shoppers spies a small cast-iron garden pot
bearing a $10 price. She lifts the pot, turns to the hostess of the
yard sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty-cent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty-cents?'' says the homeowner, her tone saturated with
incredulity. ``It's marked ten dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty-cent.''
</P>
<P>
   The homeowner shrugs. Her posture and facial expression say ``no
dice.'' She turns to another early customer. The lady with the pot
says nothing, puts the pot down, moves on to a pile of children's
clothes. She picks up a little dress, marked $2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty-cent,'' but nobody's listening.
</P>
<P>
   Why is no one listening? A Haitian made the bid, and frankly,
there is an uneasy truce between newly arrived immigrant shoppers
and longtime area residents who hold garage sales.
</P>
<P>
   It's simple, really. One culture's buying customs clash with the
selling customs of another.
</P>
<P>
   Haitians often arrive first at sales, frequently way before the
sale is to begin. Their approach to merchandise procurement is
simple: Shop till you drop _ the price, that is. Haitians are known
for driving hard bargains. Politely, but insistently.
</P>
<P>
   They are part of an astute Saturday morning shopping swarm where
English is a second language, merchandise is second-hand and
bargaining is second nature. The swarm also comes from far-away
places unfamiliar to many South Floridians, places such as Belize,
El Salvador, Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   They join other shoppers, many retired, who after 30 years on
the Ford line in Detroit or hanging Bell wire in the Northeast know
the value of a dollar.
</P>
<P>
   So join in, meet your neighbors. Bring your wallet, but credit
cards are not accepted. And don't leave home without your
foreign-language phrase books. A yard sale in Palm Beach County can
sound like a debate at the U.N.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was dawn, and the Haitians are already out in the yard,''
says Barbie Rener, 32, of West Palm Beach, host of another yard
sale. ``They always show up early. And they always make ridiculous
offers. I don't mind haggling over price, that's part of the fun of
a yard sale. But no matter what price I put on anything, it's
always the same _ `fifty-cent, twenty-five-cent, ten-cent.' Hey,
this is America, sure. Everybody comes from somewhere, but when
they pull into the driveway I prepare for anything. One lady bought
a mirror, dropped it, broke it. She wanted her money back.''
</P>
<P>
   While she's talking, a white guy maybe 30 or 35 walks right up,
dressed nattily in loose blue silk shirt, pleated linen slacks,
soft boat shoes. But he looks seedy _ bloodshot eyes, two-days'
beard. Sort of like Brad Pitt after a really bad night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got any old booze you don't drink?'' he asks. ``Sometimes I
find a case of booze. Cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No booze for sale here,'' says Rener.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got any old guns you don't shoot?'' asks the guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Noooo,'' says Rener, taking a closer look now at the guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK. Bye now,'' and he's gone, off to greener pastures in a van
full of stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Haitians are direct, sometimes a pain,'' Rener says. ``But
they're not nuts. Guatemalans are polite, don't drive a hard
bargain, and you don't see near as many. Then you get the rich
women. White. Big car, big hair, big money. Fight you for every
dime, but they'll pay sooner or later.''
</P>
<P>
   The Southeast Florida Center on Aging at Florida International
University projects 13,500 Haitians and 132,500 Hispanics,
including 30,000 Guatemalans, will live in Palm Beach County by
2000, when FIU projects a total county population of 1,066,959, up
from 863,500 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday mornings, many of Palm Beach County's newcomers take
to the yard-sale circuit, repair to the flea market behind Lake
Worth High School, browse the Goodwill store in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Jeantinoble is in the clothes racks at a sale. He's 42,
married with three kids. He left Haiti 11 years ago, lives now in
Lake Worth. He's looking for clothes for his children. And he's
looking for ``tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennis?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, tennis. Michael Jordan.'' He lifts his foot, wiggles his
shoe.
</P>
<P>
   Does he resell the clothes he buys?
</P>
<P>
   ``No. When my children grow too big for the clothes, I give them
away.''
</P>
<P>
   He's shopping in the front yard of Ernesto Rodriguez, 72, former
taxi driver in Havana, and U.S. resident for 41 years. Rodriguez
runs a sale every few months. He gets children's clothes from his
sister-in-law. His yard is better stocked than a Havana dollar
store.
</P>
<P>
   Dinis Martins, 43, is looking the goods over. He's from
Portugal. He's been in Palm Beach County for . . . one day.
</P>
<P>
   One day, and he's at a yard sale? What's he looking for?
</P>
<P>
   ``A wife,'' says Martins.
</P>
<P>
   At a yard sale?
</P>
<P>
   ``My friend said many women go to these sales. Maybe I'll visit
Cuba if I don't find a woman here.''
</P>
<P>
   A while later, at a Lake Worth yard sale, Saincius Martin shows
up with two roommates. They're furnishing a house. Martin has been
in the U.S. three weeks. He was a musician in Haiti, played piano
at churches and religious festivals. Already, he's learned to grab
bargains and resell them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can buy a stereo for $20, sell for $100,'' he says. ``You
must buy for a low price, then sell for high.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to America.
</P>
<P>
   What else does he want to buy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Connie Drosakis, the homeowner, tells Martin a couch in the
living room is for sale. Martin goes into the house. There's a
piano inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much for the piano?'' he yells to Drosakis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not for sale,'' she calls back.
</P>
<P>
   A pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much for the piano?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin exits. ``I need a piano for my work,'' says Martin, but
nobody is listening.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Jeantinoble arrives seeking kids' clothes. Mr.
Booze-and-Guns arrives seeking alcohol and firearms. The homeowner,
Ms. Drosakis, a music teacher, is thinking maybe there's a lesson
here for someone.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Martin and his pals depart in search of a piano. They won't
find a piano at the flea market in Lake Worth, but they could
furnish a house with the goods for sale in the dusty parking lot
under a bridge behind the high school. Thing is, at this bazaar
it's cash-and-carry, the merchandise is not under warranty and most
of it looks like knock-offs of knock-offs.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Gonzales, 30, is a vendor, one of 60 or more who sell out
of vans, tents and from fold-up tables. He works construction
during the week, tries to supplement his income on weekends by
selling straw hats, Latin American flags and soccer balls. He came
here from Guatemala three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Does he dream of becoming a retail magnate?
</P>
<P>
   ``I dream of going home, to Guatemala, to a farm. Someday I'll
go home,'' he says. ``When I sell enough hats.''
</P>
<P>
   His hats are made in Mexico, sell for $8. His soccer balls sell
for $18, made in Argentina. Not much here is made in the U.S.A.
There are religious icons, Jesus of the Sacred Heart paintings,
hair nets, Roma detergent, Dial Oro soaps and lotions and esponges
delux, all with labels in Spanish. For the collector there are
stamps, coins and Beanie Baby knock-offs. Table fans for those
without AC. Fresh produce is arranged on carts, but the prices are
high. One vendor sells license plates, including one that states:
I'd rather be shopping at Wal-Mart. Victor has never been to a
Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   On a good Saturday he makes $50, Gonzales says.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty dollars will buy much at the Goodwill store on Dixie
Highway in West Palm Beach. This is where yard-sale shoppers end up
when they can't find the right size kids' clothing at any price,
even 10 cents. Many of the customers are young Guatemalans who live
nearby and can't do the yard-sale circuit because they don't own
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the clothing at the Goodwill store is priced between
$1.65 and $2.85, with a couple of racks of ``reduced'' prices. The
store is clean, air-conditioned, full of freshly laundered, used
clothing. And couches, dining tables, high chairs. And Mitch Miller
and Chubby Checker records and old Easter baskets and mini-vacs,
Mr. Coffees and Mr. Teas. But no pianos.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, a bunch of young Guatemalan farmworkers wait
near a lone pay phone, wait for their turn to call home with
calling cards bought at the Cuban restaurant up the street. They

 &HT;    E-therapy: Affordable advice is now a click away
 &HT;    By John Keilman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you've got a personal problem, a computer and
a credit card, Susan Wright is ready to help.
</P>
<P>
   Just head to her web site _ www.advicelink.com _ fill out a
12-question survey about your troubles and offer up your credit
card number. For $25, Wright, a licensed independent social worker
in Cleveland, will e-mail her counsel back to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been an avant garde person, so I got in (on the
Internet) very early,'' Wright says of her service, which appears
to be the only one of its kind in Ohio. ``I knew what was going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened was the birth of a service known as e-therapy or
webcounseling, the delivery of mental health services over the
Internet. Its methods, many believe, will lead to permanent changes
in the field.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether that will be for the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt in my mind that this will become a big area
in the future, (but) the level of involvement psychologists should
have, I don't know,'' says Cheryl Meyer, an assistant professor at
Wright State University's School of Professional Psychology.
</P>
<P>
   E-therapy is virtually unstudied and unregulated. There is
little research on its effectiveness. No licensing requirements
exist. Anyone, regardless of his qualifications, can set up a web
site and charge for his advice.
</P>
<P>
   That makes many professionals nervous. Yet for now, the boards
that license psychologists, social workers and counselors in Ohio
are leaving e-therapy alone, waiting for groups like the American
Psychological Association to decide upon standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``(E-therapy) is moving so rapidly that no one knows where we
stand at this point,'' says Barbara Garwood, a member of the Ohio
State Board of Psychology. ``It's a freedom of speech issue, it's
an interstate commerce issue, it's a restraint of trade issue, it's
a protect the public issue. Holy cow, it's complex.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, New Albany, Ind., counselor Ed Needham was
dropping into chat rooms on topics from computers to coffee when he
noticed a curious phenomenon: Any time he mentioned his profession,
others immediately wanted to chat privately about their problems.
</P>
<P>
   That convinced him there was a desire for web-based counseling.
He built a site and ran it for free at first, though he later
decided to charge $15 a session. He guesses he had about 50 clients
until insurance worries prompted him to end the service a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a unique dynamic,'' he says. ``... You pick up on
something that's different (from office counseling) in that it's
more focused. It's definitely more intense at times ... You're
looking at a screen, and everything else tends to blend into the
background.''
</P>
<P>
   Needham believes he was one of the first mental health
professionals to use the web for treatment, and so far, he doesn't
appear to have a great deal of company. Only 162 practitioners of
Internet counseling are listed at www.metanoia.org/imhs _ a web
site dedicated to the activity. That compares to more than 28,000
credentialed counselors in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The method appears, however, to be gaining more acceptance.
Recovery Services of Warren and Clinton Counties, a public
behavioral health services provider in Lebanon, plans to put an
automated test on its web site to help people screen themselves for
alcoholism, depression, attention deficit disorder and anxiety
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   E-therapy practitioners acknowledge that their techniques are
limited. A counselor can't read body language or hear the tone of a
person's voice, and some experts say those are crucial failings.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of (counseling) isn't necessarily what people are
saying, it's how they're saying it. You need to look at their
non-verbal communication, and you just don't get that with
e-therapy,'' says Dr. Peter Zafirides, a professor at Ohio State
University's department of psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
   E-therapy practitioners and proponents respond that e-mail and
chat rooms have their own strengths.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Schwambach, who does e-mail counseling from her office in
Evansville, Ind., says the form inspires focus and efficiency.
What's more, it can be less expensive for patients: They don't need
to pay for a $200 hour of counseling when all they want is a brief
answer to a single question (Schwambach, who also writes a column
for newspapers, charges $1.50 a minute for her time through her web
site, www.drjudith.com).
</P>
<P>
   She also allows her Internet clients anonymity. While that's
something she says many patients desire, Zafirides says it is a
questionable virtue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the whole premise of therapy itself, there
needs to be a human connection,'' he says. ``Some of the problems
today come from people who feel more and more alienated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel I have to know the person to respond to them,''
Schwambach retorts. ``If I came upon someone having an accident, I
would not feel I have to know them to be able to help them.
</P>
<P>
   `` ... I'm more of a bottom-line person. Let's deal the matter
at hand. We have to deal with what's happening right now. And I
think most people are the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics also point to the lack of research on the subject and
the dearth of laws in place to govern it. A person does not need
any special qualifications to hang out a virtual shingle, and given
the Internet's fluidity and secrecy, that's a situation some
believe will never change.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I have told thousands of people, you're never going to cure
the problem, because so much of it is off-shore,'' says Randolph
Reaves, general counsel for the Association of State and Provincial
Psychology Boards. ``You can't do a damn thing about people who are
sitting on an oil rig in the middle of the ocean who wants to
practice psychology.''
</P>
<P>
   While some web counselors fear national or state regulations
could hurt their competitiveness, others say they would welcome new
rules. In the absence of such guidelines, John Grohol, who runs a
Columbus-based mental health web site, says potential patients
should exercise caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it works best for milder kinds of problems,'' he
says. `` ... I think given the seriousness of some problems,
there's too much potential for danger and negative outcomes when a
person turns solely to the Internet for intervention for serious
mental disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I think we're at the point where they require
face-to-face interaction. At this time, it's better to be safe.''

ABA SPIRIT EN DURES  
 SPURS PROUD OF ROOTS IN INNOVATIVE LEAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By AL TOBY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cumulus cloud-size Afros of Artis Gilmore and Darnell
Hillman have been replaced by the braids of Latrell Sprewell and
Allen Iverson.
</P>
<P>
   Julius Erving's assault on the laws of gravity in professional
basketball's first slam dunk contest paved the way for Michael
Jordan's Air-obatics 12 years later.
</P>
<P>
   The bikini-clad ball girls of the Miami Floridians are today's
Laker Girls.
</P>
<P>
   The American Basketball Association is a bygone league long
forgotten by today's generation of professional players. All that's
left of the league are scattered bits and pieces of nostalgia,
bordering between fact and myth.
</P>
<P>
   But every now and then, the ABA will creep back into the
national sports consciousness. This year, it has horned its way
onto the biggest stage in professional basketball, the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio Spurs made history when they became the first
team that merged from the ABA to reach the NBA Finals. Visions of
an all-ABA final were shattered when the New York Knicks defeated
the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference finals, much to the
chagrin of former San Antonio Spur and NBA Hall of Famer George
Gervin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really wanted an all-ABA Finals with Indiana,'' Gervin
said. ``Wouldn't that have been something special? But I'm glad
that my guys are in it. It took me 26 years to finally see this.''
</P>
<P>
   Gervin, who works as a community relations representative for
the Spurs, represents a fierce pride that ABA players feel about
their league today. It is a pride that Gervin says is rooted in
today's Spurs, even though they're a generation removed from the
red, white and blue basketball era.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of them guys give me nothing but props,'' Gervin, said.
``All they talk about is winning the championship for the Iceman.
We're the foundation for the franchise. They know without us they
wouldn't have the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Gervin is halfway right in crediting the ABA for setting the
foundation of basketball in San Antonio. He should have added that
the ABA was part of the foundation that improved the NBA. &QL; 
Vanilla vs. rainbow swirl
</P>
<P>
   If the two clashing basketball leagues were characterized by ice
cream, the NBA would be a scoop of vanilla in a crystal-clear glass
bowl. The ABA would be a scoop of rainbow swirl topped with hot
fudge, in a Dixie cup.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA was rooted in its traditional center-oriented game, do
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the major difference was the NBA had more big
people,'' said Al Bianchi, former coach of the Virginia Squires and
current scout for the Phoenix Suns. ``The ABA had more of the
little guys who could shoot and run up and down the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Those guards and forwards created a style of play that kept the
scoreboards moving at a pace that sickened staunch NBA
traditionalists. The game featured more dunks, the three-point shot
and fast breaks.
</P>
<P>
   In the ABA's first game in 1967, the Oakland Oaks defeated the
Anaheim Amigos, 132-129. Scores like these kept a modest interest
in the rag-tag league that throughout its existence was hanging on
by threads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our marketing strategy was to play good basketball for people
in the stands to talk about,'' Gervin said. ``So we had to play run
and gun. We didn't have the paper or the cable TV like they do
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The free-flowing game allowed ABA players to showcase their
personality through basketball as seen by the colorful style of
Erving, Gervin, David Thompson, Connie Hawkins, Fatty Taylor,
Lavern ``Jelly'' Tart and Louie Dampier.
</P>
<P>
   It mirrored the counterculture generation's freedom of
expression, says Dan Pattison, former vice president of the ABA
sportswriter's association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ABA gave the players a chance to express their feelings
through their motor skills, like what Dr. J did,'' Pattison said.
``The NBA would've put a stop to the free flowing of their
skills.''
</P>
<P>
   The personalities that shaped the mystique of the ABA played a
significant role in the revival of the NBA after the Pacers, Spurs,
Denver Nuggets and New York Nets were merged into the league in
1976. It supplied the NBA with the star power it had lost once the
careers wound down for Hall of Famers Wilt Chamberlain, Bill
Russell, Jerry West and Elgin Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   Sports columnist and author Terry Pluto, whose book ``Loose
Balls'' is heralded as one of the best works on the ABA, said the
merger helped save a league that was in desperate need of stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really was the dark ages of the NBA,'' Pluto said. ``At the
time, people just didn't care about basketball. It was the third
sport at the time. I would go so far as to say it was the fourth
sport behind boxing because of Muhammad Ali.''
</P>
<P>
   The infusion of ABA talent in the NBA was evident after the
merger. In the 1977 NBA All-Star game, 10 of the 24 players were
from the ABA. The Denver Nuggets had the second-best record in the
league (50-32). Half of the starting lineups in the NBA Finals
between Portland and Philadelphia were from the ABA.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-ABA head coach Tom Nissalke was the NBA Coach of the Year.
The ABA brought Stan Albeck, Bianchi, Hubie Brown, Larry Brown,
K.C. Jones, Kevin Lougherty and Doug Moe into the NBA coaching
fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   NBC broadcaster Bob Costas, who began his career doing radio for
the Spirits of St. Louis, said it was impossible for the NBA to
avoid the ABA's star influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually the NBA absorbed some of the style of the ABA,
looking at the slam dunk contest, which today has run its course,
the three-point shot and the influence of Dr. J,'' Costas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here was a guy who could be flamboyant and still be a
winner.'' &QL; 
Selling the game
</P>
<P>
   The Suns Gorilla. Halftime dance shows. Hip hop and R&AMP;B music
blasting in arenas during timeouts.
</P>
<P>
   All of these are entertaining fixtures in today's NBA. During
the league's ``dark days,'' they were non-existent.
</P>
<P>
   But in the ABA, they were a source of survival.
</P>
<P>
   According to one former ABA promotions director and current NBA
marketing official, the ABA's creative and at times outrageous
stunts set the tone for today's marketing in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Hanson, senior vice president for NBA Team Services, which
oversees the marketing strategy for 29 teams, saw firsthand how
influential the ABA was as a promotions director for the Denver
Nuggets in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really did a lot of the stuff the NBA wasn't doing,''
Hanson said. ``Back then the NBA was very traditional. We had to
try a lot harder because of the situation we were in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana Pacers had a halftime show where fans and local
media could wrestle a bear named ``Victor.'' The Kentucky Colonels
became the first and only team in ABA history to have a woman play.
Penny Ann Early passed the ball to Bobby Rascoe, who called a
timeout after her in-bound pass. The play that lasted less than
five seconds drew widespread publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Hanson said that once the NBA saw the attendance figures of the
four ABA teams that merged into the league, they took notice of the
ABA's marketing strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider the game to be the centerpiece of the action, but
we wanted to be able to appeal to families,'' Hanson said.
``Everyone isn't into the X's and O's. We wanted in some respects
to do what the ABA did.'' &QL; 
Redemption, recognition
</P>
<P>
   The ABA can take credit for giving players like Gervin a chance
at not just honing their skills, but at redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Before Gervin became the Iceman, he developed a reputation as
someone who couldn't keep his cool. While playing at Eastern
Michigan in college, Gervin punched an opposing player. His actions
resulted in the end of his career at Eastern Michigan and no
possibility of making the NBA. His only chance at professional
basketball was through the ABA.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The ABA) gave me a quick opportunity to play pro ball because
of the situation I was in,'' Gervin said. ``The ABA was there for
me, and I took advantage of it. I just wanted to play pro ball.
Back then, my opportunities were scarce.''
</P>
<P>
   Gervin took advantage of his opportunity. He averaged 21.9
points per game, which is fifth on the ABA all-time scoring list.
After the merger, Gervin won four NBA scoring titles. Only Jordan
and Chamberlain have more scoring titles.
</P>
<P>
   Another noted case involved Connie Hawkins. The New York
playground legend was blackballed by the NBA because of gambling
allegations that were unsubstantiated in court.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to compete in the NBA, Hawkins played two years for the
Pipers franchise, which moved from Pittsburgh to Minneapolis during
Hawkins' second year in the league. Hawkins was the league's first
MVP and led his team to the first ABA championship. He filed an
antitrust suit against the NBA, which was settled out of court
before he signed with the Suns in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Gervin's respect for the ABA comes from the league's willingness
to give him a chance. Gervin said the league deserves more respect
from the NBA hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, they don't even like to talk about us,'' Gervin said.
``They don't want to recognize us and our productions if you look
at the records.''
</P>
<P>
   But the history books are written by the winners, and it was the
NBA that won the basketball war, said former Indiana Pacer Len
Elmore, now a commentator for CBS-TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take a look on a league-wide basis, the NBA is
essentially part of the revisionist history,'' Elmore said. ``None
of the ABA stats are recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Gervin, ``I think it's sad that they don't recognize that
part of our careers.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Famer Rick Barry, the first NBA player to jump to the
ABA in 1967, stands on the other side of the fence. Barry, who
currently coaches the New JerseyShorecats in the USBL, described
his stint in the ABA as ``difficult'' because of the numerous
lawsuits involved with his signing with the Oakland Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   But Barry said he isn't demeaning the league, even though it had
its share of shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was what it was, no more, no less,'' Barry said. ``I
could've done without all the bush league and Mickey Mouse stuff.''

   GARAGESALE-CLASH _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The yard sale begins
at 8, but three women dressed in cottony bright island colors show
up before 7 in the bleakest of Toyotas. They move up the driveway,
fan out like a recon patrol, look over the merchandise, which is
still being lugged out of the garage by the bleary-eyed homeowner.
One of the early shoppers spies a small cast-iron garden pot
bearing a $10 price. She lifts the pot, turns to the hostess of the
yard sale. ``Fifty-cent.'' ``Fifty-cents?'' says the homeowner, her
tone saturated with incredulity. ``It's marked ten dollars.''
``Fifty-cent.'' The homeowner shrugs. Her posture and facial
expression say ``no dice.'' She turns to another early customer.
The lady with the pot says nothing, puts the pot down, moves on to
a pile of children's clothes. She picks up a little dress, marked
$2. ``Fifty-cent,'' but nobody's listening. Why is no one
listening? A Haitian made the bid, and frankly, there is an uneasy
truce between newly arrived immigrant shoppers and longtime area

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Q: I read an article about a Kenneth Russell of Louisville,
Tenn., identifying him as the World War II parachutist who hung on
the roof of a church in Sainte-Mere-Eglise, France, while German
gunners shot at him. According to a postcard I bought at that
church in 1996, the soldier's name was John Steele. Can you
explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: As many as 13,000 paratroopers were dropped near Sainte-Mere
Eglise and Pegasus Bridge in the early hours of June 6, 1944, so
it's possible that more than one became entangled on a church
steeple. But, as your postcard indicates, Steele is the person whom
most people associate with this incident.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who saw the movie ``The Longest Day'' will recall the
dramatic scene in which Pvt. John Steele was hanging from the
church steeple by the entangled harness of his parachute. From
there, he watched the wholesale murders of his buddies by German
soldiers in the town square below. Actor Red Buttons, in a reversal
from his usual comedy roles, portrayed Steele.
</P>
<P>
   The real Steele, of the 82nd Airborne Division, F Company, got
caught on the steeple just as the movie scene depicted. He tried to
cut himself down, but dropped his knife. Germans using machine guns
were firing at other paratroopers hung up in the trees, so Steele
played dead. Even so, a German saw him and shot upward, hitting
Steele in the foot. His foot kept bleeding, and as a fellow
paratrooper recounted later, Steele was petrified that an enemy
solider would see he was bleeding and shoot him again.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans took Steele prisoner after two hours, but he was
released four days later when the town was liberated by the Allies.
Steele died in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I think Jerry Falwell has really compromised his intellectual
integrity, and I want to write to tell him so. What is his address?
</P>
<P>
   A: Friends and foes alike can contact him by regular mail at
this address: The Rev. Jerry Falwell, Thomas Road Baptist Church,
701 Thomas Road, Lynchburg, VA 24502. Or by e-mail:
jerryfalwell(at)trbc.org
</P>
<P>
   Q: Not long after the movie ``Titanic'' came out, there were
several articles about plans to build one or more replica ships.
What is the status of these projects?
</P>
<P>
   A: Both seem to have sunk. Two competing firms, one with Swiss
and Las Vegas connections, the other based in South Africa, had
said they would build ships identical to the Titanic externally,
but with modern innards. One was to set sail in April 2002 on a
maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York, precisely 90
years after the original. The other was to make its initial voyage
this coming Dec. 29, which its backers called ``the eve of the new
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Not much has been heard since the projects were announced last
year, and for a good reason, according to Fran Golden, a senior
editor for Travel Weekly, a publication for travel agents. No
contracts for either replica vessel ever were signed with major
shipyards. She added that she didn't think the projects for the
replicas ever were taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Another project, calling for construction of the world's largest
oceanliner, has a better chance. But it has nothing to do with the
Titanic. That vessel, if built, would be operated by Cunard, a
subsidiary of Carnival Corp., Golden said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why did the most recent space shuttle land in total darkness?
It seems like daylight hours would be safer.
</P>
<P>
   A: Safety is a primary concern, said NASA spokesman John Petty,
but the timing was mandated by Discovery's orbit, which takes it
around Earth every 90 minutes. Not every orbit puts it within range
of landing at the Kennedy Space Center, which NASA prefers so that
the shuttle doesn't have to be transported back to Florida from
California, the alternate landing site.
</P>
<P>
   There are only a few opportunities to land the shuttle each day,
Petty said, and of the two on June 6, when Discovery came down,
both were at night. The first landing opportunity _ the one
Discovery actually used _ was an ``ideal path'' bringing the
astronauts across Costa Rica, Cuba and then almost straight up
Florida's east coast to the landing site. If it had waited just one
more orbit, Petty said, the path would have shifted to a ``less
ideal'' one taking the orbiter northbound across the Yucatan
Peninsula and across Florida just north of St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   This was the 11th time in 94 flights, by the way, that a space
shuttle has returned to Earth in darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I attended the start of the History Channel's Great Race for
vintage cars. How can I keep up with its status?
</P>
<P>
   A: Fans can keep pace with the event on The History Channel.
Each weeknight the network is presenting exclusive daily updates
along the route. Competitors in the 17th annual cross-country
event, which began June 6 in Marietta, Ga., will take about 14 days
to reach California, where the final destination is Anaheim. An
Internet site _ www.greatrace.com/ _ has general information about
the event.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I want to begin stocking water in case we run into Y2K
problems at the end of the year. How long is store-bought bottled
water good? If I put water into my own bottles or jugs, how long
will it keep?
</P>
<P>
   A: All bottled water carries an expiration date on the
container, so that should be your guide. Most bottled water is good
for up to two years; what is on store shelves now has an expiration
date of 2001. Bottles shouldn't be opened and then resealed,
because bacteria can contaminate the contents. Store the bottles in
a cool, dry place away from sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to bottle your own water, use clean containers _
just run them through the dishwasher first, with no other
sanitizing required _ and label them with the date. The water can
be kept for six months in a cool, dry place. As with the
store-bought product, don't open the bottles and drink from them
and replace the cap.
</P>
<P>
   A general rule for stocking water is to have a gallon of water
per person, per day.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where have the hummingbirds gone? In years past we have had
several birds at the feeders from April to late October. This year
we have rarely seen any.
</P>
<P>
   A: Hummingbirds nest and hang around the yard in response to
steady food sources, good nesting habitat and feasible living
areas, said Paul Thomas, a University of Georgia horticulturist. He
added that he knows of no disease or population problem. Perhaps
there has been a change in your area such as fewer trees, more
development, drought-reduced flowering of garden plants or some
other factors that made staying in that area less desirable for the
hummers.
</P>
<P>
   These tips may help you attract the birds back. Have three or
four feeders for the birds to choose from, and keep them clean and
filled. Plant phlox paniculata, Salvia guaranitica, Vitex ``Agnes
Castus,'' Nicotiana and red annual Salvia bedding plants, as well
as Impatiens. ``These are very good attractors and nector plants
that will encourage hummingbirds to stay all summer,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've heard about a spat between Rosie O'Donnell and Tom
Selleck. What happened?
</P>
<P>
   A: It had to do with guns and was but one of several incidents
involving talk show host O'Donnell. When Selleck appeared on her
program May 19, she launched into a vehement attack on the National
Rifle Association, sending the two into a heated on-air discussion.
Selleck, who said he thought he would be discussing his latest
movie, instead was asked to talk about the gun issue because he's
an NRA member and because he had participated in an ad for the
organization. O'Donnell later said she did ``not apologize for my
feelings,'' but regretted embarrassing or offending Selleck.
</P>
<P>
   After that incident, O'Donnell reportedly asked the cast of
Broadway's ``Annie Get Your Gun'' to change a song lyric in
``Anything You Can Do'' before taping her show, but the performers
refused. Representatives of O'Donnell's program and the musical
subsequently denied the report.
</P>
<P>
   And then Howard Stern accused O'Donnell of being hypocritical by
fighting for gun control while at the same time being a commercial
spokeswoman for Kmart, which sells guns. She responded by saying
Kmart is a responsibile seller of hunting rifles, which are legal
to own.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I haven't seen an update on Charismatic, the horse that broke
its leg at the Belmont Stakes. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: Charismatic broke a cannon bone, between the knee and the
ankle in his left foreleg, and the sesamoid bones in the back of
the ankle. Dr. Stephen Selway, who performed surgery for 2 1/2
hours on June 6, the day after the race, proclaimed it a success.
He added that the injury ``was not the worst of this kind I've ever
seen, but it was a nasty one.''
</P>
<P>
   Selway said he believed the colt's cannon bone fractured in the
final furlong, which is where Charismatic was passed, and the
sesamoids fractured as he tried to go on. Three screws were
inserted into the cannon bone, but Charismatic's cracked sesamoid
bones were deemed too fragile for any screws. Selway added,
however, that they would heal naturally, and ``he'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you know anything about a man in a newspaper article who
builds and repairs windmills? If so, how can I contact him?
</P>
<P>
   A: Write or call Ken O'Brock at O'Brock Windmills, 9435 12th
St., North Benton, Ohio (330-584-4681). O'Brock said he's very much
in demand from people wanting to draw their own water in case of
Y2K water system failures. A 36-page catalog about his company's
products costs $2.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have received three e-mails recently warning that Congress
is about to pass a bill allowing charges for each e-mail. Could
this be true? The bill is 602P, according to one person.
</P>
<P>
   A: Whoever is sending these e-mails is perpetuating a hoax that
seems to have started in Canada, then spread to the United States.
The usual message claims that a ``Congressman Schnell'' has
introduced ``Bill 602P'' to allow the federal government to impose
a 5-cent surcharge on each e-mail message delivered over the
Internet. The money would be collected by Internet service
providers and then turned over to the U.S. Postal Service, the
messages say.
</P>
<P>
   It's a ``completely false rumor,'' the Postal Service says. No
such proposed legislation exists, and in fact ``Congressman
Schnell'' doesn't exist, either. That alone should be a clue that
this whole scheme is a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service addressed the issue with a news release dated
May 21. The release said USPS has no authority to surcharge e-mail
messages sent over the Internet, nor would it support such
legislation. To read the release online, check the Postal Service's
Web site at www.usps.gov and click on the icon titled ``E-mail
rumor completely untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever became of O.J. Simpson's good friend who was
involved in the infamous car chase. Does anyone know what he is
doing now?
</P>
<P>
   A: Al ``A.C.'' Cowlings was the driver of the Bronco during the
famed June 17, 1994, Los Angeles freeway chase, which was televised
live from helicopters hovering overhead. A friend of Simpson's and
a college and professional football colleague, Cowlings most
recently was reported to be working as a sales representative for a
shoe and handbag company. No other details were available.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A friend lost his DD 214 discharge papers from the military.
How can he go about getting a replacement?
</P>
<P>
   A: Duplicate copies of discharge or separation papers can be
obtained by writing to the National Personnel Records Center,
Military Personnel Records, 9700 Page Blvd., St. Louis, MO
63132-5100.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran's full name should be printed clearly or typed. The
request also must contain the signature of the veteran or, if the
veteran is deceased, that of the next of kin. Include the branch of
service, service number or Social Security number, and exact or
approximate dates and years of service.
</P>
<P>
   Use Standard Form 180, ``Request Pertaining to Military
Records,'' available online at www.nara.gov/regional/mprsf180.html
or from Department of Veterans Affairs offices.

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about the person who replaced
former Atlanta resident and businessman Edward Elson as U.S.
ambassador to Denmark?
</P>
<P>
   A: Elson's successor is Richard Swett, who was nominated by
President Clinton in April 1998 and confirmed by the Senate three
months later. He presented his credentials to Denmark's Queen
Margrethe Sept. 8, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Swett was born May 1, 1957, in Lower Marion, Pa. He received a
degree in architecture from Yale University in 1979 and is a member
of the American Institute of Architects. A Democrat, he was elected
to the House in 1990. He was re-elected in 1992, but in 1994 lost
his re-election bid to Republican Charles Bass.
</P>
<P>
   Internet users can check www.usembassy.dk for detailed
information about Swett's background.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know the deadline for the lottery for Super Bowl 2000
tickets has passed, but I've been told that people who use
wheelchairs have a separate lottery with a later deadline. Is that
so?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The Super Bowl XXXIV Host Committee says the deadline
for entering the random drawing for wheelchair section tickets is
Sept. 1 (the deadline for the random drawing for regular tickets
was June 1). To request the seats, send a letter, accompanied by
proof of disability, to: Ms. Sunday Billings, Special Events
Coordinator, National Football League, 280 Park Ave., New York, NY
10017. Applicants will be notified of the results in October, with
winners receiving an invoice for one wheelchair seat and one
companion seat.
</P>
<P>
   The Host Committee emphasizes that this drawing is only for
guests using wheelchairs, with disabled guests using other forms of
assistance not eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm sorry Charismatic was injured in the Belmont Stakes, but
I'd like some information about the winner, Lemon Drop Kid. Who is
his owner, trainer, and jockey?
</P>
<P>
   A: The owner is Jeanne Vance, who husband, Laddie Dance, is a
former auctioneer at Keeneland, a track near Lexington, Ky. The
trainer is Scotty Schulhofer, and the jockey is Jose Santos. The
colt, a son of Kingmambo, was named by Vance in honor of a champion
show horse from years back. That horse, incidentally, took its name
from a Damon Runyon character.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon Drop Kid had won only once this year, at Florida's
Gulfstream Park in February. He finished ninth in the Kentucky
Derby and passed on the Preakness. He then ran in the Peter Pan
Stakes at Belmont, finishing third. It's expected that he will get
a break now, probably to surface in several months at Saratoga Race
Course in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   It was jockey Santos' first win in 17 tries in a Triple Crown
race. It was trainer Schulhofer's second Triple Crown victory, the
first coming in the 1993 Belmont with Colonial Affair.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your response to the reader's question about the number of
executive orders signed by President Clinton raises another
question. How many executive orders were signed by recent previous
presidents?
</P>
<P>
   A: According to the National Archives and Records Administration
Federal Register, President Kennedy signed 214 executive orders
between 1961 and 1963; Johnson, 324 (1963-69); Nixon, 346
(1969-74); Ford, 169 (1974-77); Carter, 320 (1977-81); Reagan, 381
(1981-89); Bush, 166 (1989-93). And Clinton has signed 289 from
1993 to the present.
</P>
<P>
   Executive order tables can be viewed online at
www.nara.gov/fedreg/eo.html
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened in the Synthroid class action suit? I sent
in my paperwork about this time last year, but I've never heard
anything one way or the other.
</P>
<P>
   A: There has been no settlement yet. The suit contends that the
drug's manufacturer suppressed for more than seven years the
publication of a medical study whose conclusion was that the drug's
generic equivalent worked just as well in the treatment of thyroid
problems.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 10, 1998, Judge Elaine Bucklo of the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of Illinois held a status conference in
this litigation. The court scheduled further proceedings in the
litigation through October 1999. No trial date has yet been set.
And no money will be paid to any class members unless and until a
class is certified by the court, and the class obtains a final
judgment in its favor after trial or a further settlement is agreed
upon and approved by the court. The safety and effectiveness of
Synthroid isn't involved, by the way.
</P>
<P>
   An Internet site on the subject _ www.synthroidclaims.com _
advises people who already have filed a claim form that their name
and address will be maintained by the settlement administrator, and
no further action is required. Information: 1-800-853-4853.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the origin of the dollar sign?
</P>
<P>
   A: Some people think it evolved from the letter S over the
letter U, with the bottom part of the U dropped off. But that's not
so, according to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing and World
Book Encyclopedia. They explain that $ most likely evolved from the
Mexican or Spanish Ps, for pesos or piastres. The S gradually came
to be written over the P, developing a close equivalent to $. It
was widely used before the adoption of the U.S. dollar in 1785.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I keep seeing ads on TV, usually featuring celebrities, for a
book titled ``Power for Living.'' Do you have any information about
the sponsoring organization?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Arthur S. DeMoss Foundation, established in 1955 by
Arthur DeMoss, a Philadelphia businessman known for his funding of
evangelical causes, is behind the book, which is described as a
Christian self-help guide. The foundation, now based in West Palm
Beach, Fla., is headed by DeMoss' widow, Nancy, and continues to
support evangelical outreach efforts such as Campus Crusade for
Christ.
</P>
<P>
   The book is free (1-800-341-2000), and foundation literature
says those who respond will not be called or solicited for money.
</P>
<P>
   An article in The Washington Post reported that the ad campaign
has drawn some concern because of its characterization of religion
as an antidote for depression. But Michael Cromartie of the Ethics
and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank, defended it.
``There is nothing sinister about it,'' he told the Post. ``This is
a genuine effort to get people to consider the claims of the
Gospel.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the reasoning behind New Hampshire's taking so long
to adopt the Martin Luther King Jr. national holiday?
</P>
<P>
   A: New Hampshire for years has been observing what it called
Civil Rights Day, but until Monday it didn't have King's name
attached. The change to Martin Luther King Jr. Civil Rights Day,
which will be observed for the first time next Jan. 17, ends two
decades of attempts to honor the slain civil rights leader.
Opponents had argued that singling out King would detract from
other American heroes, such as George Washington and Abraham
Lincoln. The Nashua (N.H.) Telegraph also reported that legislative
and other critics had opposed a holiday named for King because of
his vocal opposition to the Vietnam War, allegations of ties with
Communist leaders, and unsubstantiated stories about King's
personal life.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who are the members of Congress who filed a lawsuit to
declare the U.S. bombing of Yugoslavia illegal?
</P>
<P>
   A: Initially there were 17 plaintiffs seeking ``declaratory
relief'' against President Clinton, saying he was
unconstitutionally continuing a military attack against Yugoslavia
without obtaining a declaration of war from Congress. The suit,
filed April 30, was amended later to include 26, then 31, members
of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Those initial 17: Reps. Tom Campbell (R-Calif.), Dennis Kucinich
(D-Ohio), Bob Barr (R-Ga.), Roscoe Bartlett (R-Md.), Dan Burton
(R-Ind.), John Cooksey (R-La.), Philip Crane (R-Ill.), Walter Jones
(R-N.C.), Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio), Donald Manzullo (R-Ill.), Charlie
Norwood (R-Ga.), Ron Paul (R-Texas), Thomas Petri (R-Wis.),
Marshall Sanford (R-S.C.), Joe Scarborough (R-Fla.), Bob Schaffer
(R-Colo.) and Thomas Tancredo (R-Colo.).
</P>
<P>
   Those joining: Reps. Richard Baker (R-La.), Christopher Cannon
(R-Utah), Terry Everett (R-Ala.), Jack Metcalf (R-Wash.), John
Doolittle (R-Calif.), Rick Hill (R-Mont.), Greg Ganske (R-Iowa),
Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), John Duncan Jr. (R-Tenn.), Pat Danner
(D-Mo.); Fortney ``Pete'' Stark (D-Calif.); F. James Sensenbrenner
Jr. (R-Wis.); Van Hilleary (R-Tenn.) and Curt Weldon (R-Pa.).
</P>
<P>
   The suit was dismissed June 8 by a federal judge in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happens when an airport closes during a storm?
Presumably, planes aren't allowed to land and take off. If all
airports closed during storms, wouldn't that help prevent crashes
such as the one that occurred at Little Rock, Ark.?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're right to say that when an airport closes, planes don't
land or take off. But there's no universal rule saying all airports
must close during storms. It's up to the individual airport
operators to make that decision. During periods of bad weather, the
Federal Aviation Administration can institute traffic management
procedures that could result in no arrivals and departures for a
period of time, but the FAA itself cannot order any airport to
close. When an airport is open, the FAA gives the pilot information
about the weather when he or she requests clearance to land. Then
it's up to the pilot to make the ultimate decision, said FAA
spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen.

   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at

<P>
   Q: I read an article about a Kenneth Russell of Louisville,
Tenn., identifying him as the World War II parachutist who hung on
the roof of a church in Sainte-Mere-Eglise, France, while German
gunners shot at him. According to a postcard I bought at that
church in 1996, the soldier's name was John Steele. Can you
explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: As many as 13,000 paratroopers were dropped near Sainte-Mere
Eglise and Pegasus Bridge in the early hours of June 6, 1944, so
it's possible that more than one became entangled on a church
steeple. But, as your postcard indicates, Steele is the person whom
most people associate with this incident.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who saw the movie ``The Longest Day'' will recall the
dramatic scene in which Pvt. John Steele was hanging from the
church steeple by the entangled harness of his parachute. From
there, he watched the wholesale murders of his buddies by German
soldiers in the town square below. Actor Red Buttons, in a reversal
from his usual comedy roles, portrayed Steele.
</P>
<P>
   The real Steele, of the 82nd Airborne Division, F Company, got
caught on the steeple just as the movie scene depicted. He tried to
cut himself down, but dropped his knife. Germans using machine guns
were firing at other paratroopers hung up in the trees, so Steele
played dead. Even so, a German saw him and shot upward, hitting
Steele in the foot. His foot kept bleeding, and as a fellow
paratrooper recounted later, Steele was petrified that an enemy
solider would see he was bleeding and shoot him again.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans took Steele prisoner after two hours, but he was
released four days later when the town was liberated by the Allies.
Steele died in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I think Jerry Falwell has really compromised his intellectual
integrity, and I want to write to tell him so. What is his address?
</P>
<P>
   A: Friends and foes alike can contact him by regular mail at
this address: The Rev. Jerry Falwell, Thomas Road Baptist Church,
701 Thomas Road, Lynchburg, VA 24502. Or by e-mail:
jerryfalwell(at)trbc.org
</P>
<P>
   Q: Not long after the movie ``Titanic'' came out, there were
several articles about plans to build one or more replica ships.
What is the status of these projects?
</P>
<P>
   A: Both seem to have sunk. Two competing firms, one with Swiss
and Las Vegas connections, the other based in South Africa, had
said they would build ships identical to the Titanic externally,
but with modern innards. One was to set sail in April 2002 on a
maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York, precisely 90
years after the original. The other was to make its initial voyage
this coming Dec. 29, which its backers called ``the eve of the new
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Not much has been heard since the projects were announced last
year, and for a good reason, according to Fran Golden, a senior
editor for Travel Weekly, a publication for travel agents. No
contracts for either replica vessel ever were signed with major
shipyards. She added that she didn't think the projects for the
replicas ever were taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Another project, calling for construction of the world's largest
oceanliner, has a better chance. But it has nothing to do with the
Titanic. That vessel, if built, would be operated by Cunard, a
subsidiary of Carnival Corp., Golden said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why did the most recent space shuttle land in total darkness?
It seems like daylight hours would be safer.
</P>
<P>
   A: Safety is a primary concern, said NASA spokesman John Petty,
but the timing was mandated by Discovery's orbit, which takes it
around Earth every 90 minutes. Not every orbit puts it within range
of landing at the Kennedy Space Center, which NASA prefers so that
the shuttle doesn't have to be transported back to Florida from
California, the alternate landing site.
</P>
<P>
   There are only a few opportunities to land the shuttle each day,
Petty said, and of the two on June 6, when Discovery came down,
both were at night. The first landing opportunity _ the one
Discovery actually used _ was an ``ideal path'' bringing the
astronauts across Costa Rica, Cuba and then almost straight up
Florida's east coast to the landing site. If it had waited just one
more orbit, Petty said, the path would have shifted to a ``less
ideal'' one taking the orbiter northbound across the Yucatan
Peninsula and across Florida just north of St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   This was the 11th time in 94 flights, by the way, that a space
shuttle has returned to Earth in darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I attended the start of the History Channel's Great Race for
vintage cars. How can I keep up with its status?
</P>
<P>
   A: Fans can keep pace with the event on The History Channel.
Each weeknight the network is presenting exclusive daily updates
along the route. Competitors in the 17th annual cross-country
event, which began June 6 in Marietta, Ga., will take about 14 days
to reach California, where the final destination is Anaheim. An
Internet site _ www.greatrace.com/ _ has general information about
the event.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I want to begin stocking water in case we run into Y2K
problems at the end of the year. How long is store-bought bottled
water good? If I put water into my own bottles or jugs, how long
will it keep?
</P>
<P>
   A: All bottled water carries an expiration date on the
container, so that should be your guide. Most bottled water is good
for up to two years; what is on store shelves now has an expiration
date of 2001. Bottles shouldn't be opened and then resealed,
because bacteria can contaminate the contents. Store the bottles in
a cool, dry place away from sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to bottle your own water, use clean containers _
just run them through the dishwasher first, with no other
sanitizing required _ and label them with the date. The water can
be kept for six months in a cool, dry place. As with the
store-bought product, don't open the bottles and drink from them
and replace the cap.
</P>
<P>
   A general rule for stocking water is to have a gallon of water
per person, per day.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where have the hummingbirds gone? In years past we have had
several birds at the feeders from April to late October. This year
we have rarely seen any.
</P>
<P>
   A: Hummingbirds nest and hang around the yard in response to
steady food sources, good nesting habitat and feasible living
areas, said Paul Thomas, a University of Georgia horticulturist. He
added that he knows of no disease or population problem. Perhaps
there has been a change in your area such as fewer trees, more
development, drought-reduced flowering of garden plants or some
other factors that made staying in that area less desirable for the
hummers.
</P>
<P>
   These tips may help you attract the birds back. Have three or
four feeders for the birds to choose from, and keep them clean and
filled. Plant phlox paniculata, Salvia guaranitica, Vitex ``Agnes
Castus,'' Nicotiana and red annual Salvia bedding plants, as well
as Impatiens. ``These are very good attractors and nector plants
that will encourage hummingbirds to stay all summer,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've heard about a spat between Rosie O'Donnell and Tom
Selleck. What happened?
</P>
<P>
   A: It had to do with guns and was but one of several incidents
involving talk show host O'Donnell. When Selleck appeared on her
program May 19, she launched into a vehement attack on the National
Rifle Association, sending the two into a heated on-air discussion.
Selleck, who said he thought he would be discussing his latest
movie, instead was asked to talk about the gun issue because he's
an NRA member and because he had participated in an ad for the
organization. O'Donnell later said she did ``not apologize for my
feelings,'' but regretted embarrassing or offending Selleck.
</P>
<P>
   After that incident, O'Donnell reportedly asked the cast of
Broadway's ``Annie Get Your Gun'' to change a song lyric in
``Anything You Can Do'' before taping her show, but the performers
refused. Representatives of O'Donnell's program and the musical
subsequently denied the report.
</P>
<P>
   And then Howard Stern accused O'Donnell of being hypocritical by
fighting for gun control while at the same time being a commercial
spokeswoman for Kmart, which sells guns. She responded by saying
Kmart is a responsibile seller of hunting rifles, which are legal
to own.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I haven't seen an update on Charismatic, the horse that broke
its leg at the Belmont Stakes. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: Charismatic broke a cannon bone, between the knee and the
ankle in his left foreleg, and the sesamoid bones in the back of
the ankle. Dr. Stephen Selway, who performed surgery for 2 1/2
hours on June 6, the day after the race, proclaimed it a success.
He added that the injury ``was not the worst of this kind I've ever
seen, but it was a nasty one.''
</P>
<P>
   Selway said he believed the colt's cannon bone fractured in the
final furlong, which is where Charismatic was passed, and the
sesamoids fractured as he tried to go on. Three screws were
inserted into the cannon bone, but Charismatic's cracked sesamoid
bones were deemed too fragile for any screws. Selway added,
however, that they would heal naturally, and ``he'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you know anything about a man in a newspaper article who
builds and repairs windmills? If so, how can I contact him?
</P>
<P>
   A: Write or call Ken O'Brock at O'Brock Windmills, 9435 12th
St., North Benton, Ohio (330-584-4681). O'Brock said he's very much
in demand from people wanting to draw their own water in case of
Y2K water system failures. A 36-page catalog about his company's
products costs $2.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have received three e-mails recently warning that Congress
is about to pass a bill allowing charges for each e-mail. Could
this be true? The bill is 602P, according to one person.
</P>
<P>
   A: Whoever is sending these e-mails is perpetuating a hoax that
seems to have started in Canada, then spread to the United States.
The usual message claims that a ``Congressman Schnell'' has
introduced ``Bill 602P'' to allow the federal government to impose
a 5-cent surcharge on each e-mail message delivered over the
Internet. The money would be collected by Internet service
providers and then turned over to the U.S. Postal Service, the
messages say.
</P>
<P>
   It's a ``completely false rumor,'' the Postal Service says. No
such proposed legislation exists, and in fact ``Congressman
Schnell'' doesn't exist, either. That alone should be a clue that
this whole scheme is a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service addressed the issue with a news release dated
May 21. The release said USPS has no authority to surcharge e-mail
messages sent over the Internet, nor would it support such
legislation. To read the release online, check the Postal Service's
Web site at www.usps.gov and click on the icon titled ``E-mail
rumor completely untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever became of O.J. Simpson's good friend who was
involved in the infamous car chase. Does anyone know what he is
doing now?
</P>
<P>
   A: Al ``A.C.'' Cowlings was the driver of the Bronco during the
famed June 17, 1994, Los Angeles freeway chase, which was televised
live from helicopters hovering overhead. A friend of Simpson's and
a college and professional football colleague, Cowlings most
recently was reported to be working as a sales representative for a
shoe and handbag company. No other details were available.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A friend lost his DD 214 discharge papers from the military.
How can he go about getting a replacement?
</P>
<P>
   A: Duplicate copies of discharge or separation papers can be
obtained by writing to the National Personnel Records Center,
Military Personnel Records, 9700 Page Blvd., St. Louis, MO
63132-5100.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran's full name should be printed clearly or typed. The
request also must contain the signature of the veteran or, if the
veteran is deceased, that of the next of kin. Include the branch of
service, service number or Social Security number, and exact or
approximate dates and years of service.
</P>
<P>
   Use Standard Form 180, ``Request Pertaining to Military
Records,'' available online at www.nara.gov/regional/mprsf180.html
or from Department of Veterans Affairs offices.

FEW OPTIONS REMAIN IN BULLPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It's official, the Diamondbacks' bullpen situation is
a complete mess, not just a minimal one.
</P>
<P>
   If this were a wreck on the Squaw Peak Freeway, the DPS boys
would have the dang thing shut down for 16 hours, not knowing what
to make of it.
</P>
<P>
   Buck Showalter, the favorite target of the backseat managers at
Bank One Ballpark and the airwaves, has, plain and simple, run out
of options and must be at his wit's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see what tomorrow brings,'' he answered when asked
whether his ninth-inning situation is any closer to being cleared
up.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Olson, who started the season as the closer, seems to have
lost all remnants of any confidence he once possessed. Even though
he managed to save Tuesday's victory over the major league-worst
Florida Marlins, it couldn't come without the usual drama.
</P>
<P>
   Olson gave up an RBI single and hit a batter before the very
dangerous Cliff Floyd grounded out while swinging at the first
pitch he saw. Olson did register his third consecutive save, but
his saves seem to come prepackaged with loads of anxiety, and that
simply is not a good mix for a closer.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Nunez, whom Showalter badly wanted to see nail down the
save Tuesday, couldn't deliver, issuing a single and a four-pitch
walk after retiring the first batter in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Nunez was replaced by left-hander Dan Plesac, who struck out
pinch-hitter Mark Kotsay before being replaced by Olson. Plesac has
now retired all five batters he has faced since being acquired from
Toronto and is doing exactly what the Diamondbacks envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   Plesac's role, though, will be that of a situational reliever,
primarily facing left-handed batters and heading to the dugout at
the first sign of a right-hander. At this stage of his career,
Plesac has come to grips with that role, for which he is highly
suited.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Holmes, the best set-up pitcher the club has on its
roster, once again turned in a fine effort. After allowing a
run-scoring single, he struck out Floyd on a nasty split-fingered
fastball and then got the final two outs in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes has lowered his ERA to 2.77 and is set up perfectly in
his current role. There is no need to meddle with him. Anyone
thinking Holmes should be moved to closer would be wise to think of
the club's needs in the seventh and eighth innings first.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Swindell, the other left-hander, hasn't pitched since
Saturday and is suffering from soreness in his rib cage. He has not
been available the past three games and will probably won't be
available tonight. If his condition does not progress by Friday,
the club will probably place Swindell on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Byung-Hyun Kim is an intriguing piece to the puzzle but has had
problems pitching consecutive days. He may be best suited as a
setup man or a possible starter down the line.
</P>
<P>
   In order for the Diamondbacks' bullpen to work best, the closer
must emerge from between Olson and Nunez. A bullpen by committee
simply does not work.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping Swindell and Plesac as the left-handers, to be used
interchangeably at different stages of the game, is the best
scenario from that standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping Holmes in his role is definitely in his and the club's
best interest. That leaves Olson and Nun ez to battle it out for
the closer's role.
</P>
<P>
   The bad karma surrounding Olson these days has too many negative
vibes for him to work at this juncture. The mere fact that he hears
boos drowning out his name over the loudspeakers at his home
stadium puts him in a negative state of mind before he delivers his
first pitch. You can bet it also puts the opposition in a positive
state.
</P>
<P>
   Nunez could be the man. The opportunity is his for the taking
right now, but repeating what he did Tuesday night will not endear
him to the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the closer's job with all my soul,'' Nunez said before
Tuesday's game. ``There is no comparison to how I feel now and when
I came up for the first time last year. I now know I can do the
job.''
</P>
<P>
   All he has to do is seize it and it's his. Showalter is
desperately searching for someone to step forward. &QL;

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: In two takes _ take 2)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about the person who replaced
former Atlanta resident and businessman Edward Elson as U.S.
ambassador to Denmark?
</P>
<P>
   A: Elson's successor is Richard Swett, who was nominated by
President Clinton in April 1998 and confirmed by the Senate three
months later. He presented his credentials to Denmark's Queen
Margrethe Sept. 8, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Swett was born May 1, 1957, in Lower Marion, Pa. He received a
degree in architecture from Yale University in 1979 and is a member
of the American Institute of Architects. A Democrat, he was elected
to the House in 1990. He was re-elected in 1992, but in 1994 lost
his re-election bid to Republican Charles Bass.
</P>
<P>
   Internet users can check www.usembassy.dk for detailed
information about Swett's background.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know the deadline for the lottery for Super Bowl 2000
tickets has passed, but I've been told that people who use
wheelchairs have a separate lottery with a later deadline. Is that
so?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The Super Bowl XXXIV Host Committee says the deadline
for entering the random drawing for wheelchair section tickets is
Sept. 1 (the deadline for the random drawing for regular tickets
was June 1). To request the seats, send a letter, accompanied by
proof of disability, to: Ms. Sunday Billings, Special Events
Coordinator, National Football League, 280 Park Ave., New York, NY
10017. Applicants will be notified of the results in October, with
winners receiving an invoice for one wheelchair seat and one
companion seat.
</P>
<P>
   The Host Committee emphasizes that this drawing is only for
guests using wheelchairs, with disabled guests using other forms of
assistance not eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm sorry Charismatic was injured in the Belmont Stakes, but
I'd like some information about the winner, Lemon Drop Kid. Who is
his owner, trainer, and jockey?
</P>
<P>
   A: The owner is Jeanne Vance, who husband, Laddie Dance, is a
former auctioneer at Keeneland, a track near Lexington, Ky. The
trainer is Scotty Schulhofer, and the jockey is Jose Santos. The
colt, a son of Kingmambo, was named by Vance in honor of a champion
show horse from years back. That horse, incidentally, took its name
from a Damon Runyon character.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon Drop Kid had won only once this year, at Florida's
Gulfstream Park in February. He finished ninth in the Kentucky
Derby and passed on the Preakness. He then ran in the Peter Pan
Stakes at Belmont, finishing third. It's expected that he will get
a break now, probably to surface in several months at Saratoga Race
Course in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   It was jockey Santos' first win in 17 tries in a Triple Crown
race. It was trainer Schulhofer's second Triple Crown victory, the
first coming in the 1993 Belmont with Colonial Affair.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your response to the reader's question about the number of
executive orders signed by President Clinton raises another
question. How many executive orders were signed by recent previous
presidents?
</P>
<P>
   A: According to the National Archives and Records Administration
Federal Register, President Kennedy signed 214 executive orders
between 1961 and 1963; Johnson, 324 (1963-69); Nixon, 346
(1969-74); Ford, 169 (1974-77); Carter, 320 (1977-81); Reagan, 381
(1981-89); Bush, 166 (1989-93). And Clinton has signed 289 from
1993 to the present.
</P>
<P>
   Executive order tables can be viewed online at
www.nara.gov/fedreg/eo.html
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened in the Synthroid class action suit? I sent
in my paperwork about this time last year, but I've never heard
anything one way or the other.
</P>
<P>
   A: There has been no settlement yet. The suit contends that the
drug's manufacturer suppressed for more than seven years the
publication of a medical study whose conclusion was that the drug's
generic equivalent worked just as well in the treatment of thyroid
problems.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 10, 1998, Judge Elaine Bucklo of the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of Illinois held a status conference in
this litigation. The court scheduled further proceedings in the
litigation through October 1999. No trial date has yet been set.
And no money will be paid to any class members unless and until a
class is certified by the court, and the class obtains a final
judgment in its favor after trial or a further settlement is agreed
upon and approved by the court. The safety and effectiveness of
Synthroid isn't involved, by the way.
</P>
<P>
   An Internet site on the subject _ www.synthroidclaims.com _
advises people who already have filed a claim form that their name
and address will be maintained by the settlement administrator, and
no further action is required. Information: 1-800-853-4853.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the origin of the dollar sign?
</P>
<P>
   A: Some people think it evolved from the letter S over the
letter U, with the bottom part of the U dropped off. But that's not
so, according to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing and World
Book Encyclopedia. They explain that $ most likely evolved from the
Mexican or Spanish Ps, for pesos or piastres. The S gradually came
to be written over the P, developing a close equivalent to $. It
was widely used before the adoption of the U.S. dollar in 1785.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I keep seeing ads on TV, usually featuring celebrities, for a
book titled ``Power for Living.'' Do you have any information about
the sponsoring organization?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Arthur S. DeMoss Foundation, established in 1955 by
Arthur DeMoss, a Philadelphia businessman known for his funding of
evangelical causes, is behind the book, which is described as a
Christian self-help guide. The foundation, now based in West Palm
Beach, Fla., is headed by DeMoss' widow, Nancy, and continues to
support evangelical outreach efforts such as Campus Crusade for
Christ.
</P>
<P>
   The book is free (1-800-341-2000), and foundation literature
says those who respond will not be called or solicited for money.
</P>
<P>
   An article in The Washington Post reported that the ad campaign
has drawn some concern because of its characterization of religion
as an antidote for depression. But Michael Cromartie of the Ethics
and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank, defended it.
``There is nothing sinister about it,'' he told the Post. ``This is
a genuine effort to get people to consider the claims of the
Gospel.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the reasoning behind New Hampshire's taking so long
to adopt the Martin Luther King Jr. national holiday?
</P>
<P>
   A: New Hampshire for years has been observing what it called
Civil Rights Day, but until Monday it didn't have King's name
attached. The change to Martin Luther King Jr. Civil Rights Day,
which will be observed for the first time next Jan. 17, ends two
decades of attempts to honor the slain civil rights leader.
Opponents had argued that singling out King would detract from
other American heroes, such as George Washington and Abraham
Lincoln. The Nashua (N.H.) Telegraph also reported that legislative
and other critics had opposed a holiday named for King because of
his vocal opposition to the Vietnam War, allegations of ties with
Communist leaders, and unsubstantiated stories about King's
personal life.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who are the members of Congress who filed a lawsuit to
declare the U.S. bombing of Yugoslavia illegal?
</P>
<P>
   A: Initially there were 17 plaintiffs seeking ``declaratory
relief'' against President Clinton, saying he was
unconstitutionally continuing a military attack against Yugoslavia
without obtaining a declaration of war from Congress. The suit,
filed April 30, was amended later to include 26, then 31, members
of Congress.

</P>
<P>
   The suit was dismissed June 8 by a federal judge in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happens when an airport closes during a storm?
Presumably, planes aren't allowed to land and take off. If all
airports closed during storms, wouldn't that help prevent crashes
such as the one that occurred at Little Rock, Ark.?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're right to say that when an airport closes, planes don't
land or take off. But there's no universal rule saying all airports
must close during storms. It's up to the individual airport
operators to make that decision. During periods of bad weather, the
Federal Aviation Administration can institute traffic management
procedures that could result in no arrivals and departures for a
period of time, but the FAA itself cannot order any airport to
close. When an airport is open, the FAA gives the pilot information
about the weather when he or she requests clearance to land. Then
it's up to the pilot to make the ultimate decision, said FAA
spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen.

 &HT;    'AMC' star wouldn't trade his soap life
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ You may've finally nailed an Emmy, Erica
Kane, but I got the real trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Montgomery all to myself!
</P>
<P>
   Sweat flies as we flail, almost in unison, sharing a common
goal. I see bright colors, I hear bells ring. And then ... cries of
bliss! He finishes first.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Willey whipped me at Whack-a-Mole, 220 to 160.
</P>
<P>
   Willey, who plays dashing attorney Jackson Montgomery on All My
Children, joined me in the arcade at Pete Rose's Ballpark Cafe in
Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   The mission, you see, is to crush metal critters with a mallet
as they randomly pop in and out of holes. ``Anticipate the mole,''
Willey coaches, his face comically stern. ``You're not anticipating
the mole!''
</P>
<P>
   Let's play Skeeball already.
</P>
<P>
   The actor, who also does stand-up comedy, was in town last
weekend for a gig at Bocanuts and an appearance at the Downtown
Uptown Flea Market.
</P>
<P>
   Today, though, it's all about game tokens, conch fritters, fried
grouper strips and ... his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marie's the antithesis of myself in a very complementary
way,'' he gushes. ``She's very centered, she's very calm, and I've
never heard her raise her voice. You know, come to think of it,
she's my mother!''
</P>
<P>
   The couple wed in 1994, seven years after Willey landed the role
of Jackson Montgomery, Pine Valley's beefcake barrister with a
voice so deep you could dive in it.
</P>
<P>
   But Marie thought Willey was a cop. Really a cop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jersey City police gave me an honorary badge because I've
been grand marshal of the town's St. Patty's parade for, like, 13
years,'' he recalls. ``I guess I had the badge in my bag or
something, and it fell out when I was at this tanning place. Marie
was working there, and she found it and tracked me down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next time I went in, I asked her out. Eventually, she came
to work for me as a personal assistant. Hey, I gave her health
insurance!''
</P>
<P>
   He wooed her with a deductible?
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways the whole thing couldn't have been less romantic,
but at the same time, I'm so in love with this woman. There's no
doubt in my mind in any way, shape or form that we'll be together
for the rest of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   She's his third wife.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Montgomery and Erica Kane, however, aren't so tight. After
the lustful lawyer ventured to Pine Valley in 1987, he swiped Erica
from his brother, Travis. But they couldn't wed because Bianca _
Erica and Travis' daughter _ was dying and wanted her parents back
together.
</P>
<P>
   Long story short, there remains A Thing between Jack and Erica.
You know, simmering beneath the surface.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the first time he kissed Susan Lucci, who plays
Erica, Willey replies: ``I honestly don't remember, if you can
believe it. My blood pressure sent the memory right out of my
head.''
</P>
<P>
   Willey's earliest memories are from Ottawa, Ill., a rural town
about 60 miles southeast of Chicago. His dad worked the swing shift
at a glass factory (``for 40 years and never complained''), and his
mom, also employed at the plant, became a homemaker after Willey
and his younger sister came along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a half-brother, Billy, a grandmother, Millie, and I'm
Wally Willey. Can you just get over that?!''
</P>
<P>
   Willey, now 48, went on to major in sculpture at Southern
Illinois University, where he dabbled in theater. He worked for a
while at a toy company, then chucked it all for New York at age 30.
</P>
<P>
   After stints on Another World and Ryan's Hope, he became what he
calls ``a breathing prop'' on AMC. And then Jack Montgomery came
along _ and 260 shows a year.
</P>
<P>
   Willey lives in Jersey City, N.J., during taping in New York,
then zips home to Santa Fe, N.M., where his wife runs a bed and
breakfast on a 60-acre farm (complete with pygmy hedgehogs, no
less). They have a son and daughter: Chance, 4, and Merit, 7
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I end up spending more time with my family this way
than if I left at 6:30 a.m. to drive into the city and got home at
9 at night just in time to kiss the kids good night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Waltster is aware that soap stars often get razzed as the
Rodney Dangerfields of acting. You know, no respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't find me complaining,'' he says. ``Yeah, we work
really long hours, but there are people working really long hours
at Burger King, too. So no, I don't have any plans to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, the way I see it, they can carry me out of Pine
Valley in a pine box.''
</P>

 &HT;    Nickelodeon, at 20, is good and fun
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Television's loudest, wildest kid turns 20 this
month and has absolutely, positively NO plans to grow up. No way.
Green slime forever!
</P>
<P>
   The kid in question is Nickelodeon, the first-ever kids'
network, which is celebrating its two-decade birthday throughout
June. For the uninitiated, this is the cable network that gave us
``Blue's Clues,'' the highest-rated children's show on TV; the
wildly popular ``Rugrats''; and Linda Ellerbee's acclaimed weekly
newsmagazine, ``Nick News.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon is the reason a whole generation of viewers don't
distinguish between cable and broadcast channels. They just watch
TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``For that generation, Nickelodeon legitimized non-network TV,''
said Jennings Bryant, a University of Alabama professor and
nationally recognized scholar on children's TV. ``It took down the
barricade that labeled programming network, PBS, cable or something
else. Children recognized that Nickelodeon is for them, and it came
at a time when the networks were forsaking children's
programming.''
</P>
<P>
   After debuting on a single cable system in Buffalo, N.Y., with
an educational magazine for pre schoolers called ``Pinwheel,''
Nickelodeon became the No. 1 kids' network a decade later. Along
the way, it revolutionized the way children's programming is
produced and the way children watch television. For better or
worse. Besides the lovely ``Blue's Clues,'' Nickelodeon also gave
us the gross-out, bodily-function-prone cartoon ``Ren and Stimpy.''
</P>
<P>
   PBS may be home of the top-of-the-line educational shows, but
Nickelodeon hooks kids with guffaws and goo. Which is not to say
the cable network doesn't also do good deeds. It does, but nobody's
going to confuse Nickelodeon with PBS.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly been an influential force in television,'' Bryant
said. ``It hasn't been entirely good or entirely bad. One thing it
does better than anyone else is to put themselves into the kids'
perspective. Part of what they do is make sure everything they do
taps into children's psyches in ways others haven't.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence ``Double Dare,'' the game show that celebrated mess in a
big way with lots of lumpy green slime dumped on kid contestants.
The series was a mega-hit when it debuted in 1986. And ``Rugrats,''
with the emotional and physical perspective of a toddler bumbling
through an adult world, is often cable's most popular program.
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon started out as a marketing tool to entice families
to subscribe to cable. Early programming was strictly educational.
But kids didn't really pay attention until 1982, when green slime
was introduced on the sketch comedy series ``You Can't Do That on
Television.'' Word of mouth spread faster than a marble on glass,
spread, and kids started flipping to Nickelodeon.
</P>
<P>
   By 1985, when the network merged with MTV, the focus shifted
from education to enjoyment. Programmers in the network's bright
green and orange studio in Los Angeles decided to give kids what
they wanted, not what grown-ups thought was good for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've done a lot of research to find out about the needs,
wants and wishes of kids,'' Bryant said. ``It was the first
commercial TV entity to engage in research to create a
curriculum-based program with specific child goals in mind. PBS has
done this for many years, but Nickelodeon realized if they were
going to reach young children, they needed to do so with their
parents' approval.''
</P>
<P>
   The most positive impact has been the early-morning
preschoolers' block dubbed Nick Jr. ``Eureeka's Castle,'' which
taught social skills and imaginative play, was the flagship show in
'89. ``Blue's Clues'' is part of the package now, as is the
landmark ``Gullah Gullah Island.'' The former was designed to help
preschoolers develop thinking and social skills through ``flexible
thinking.'' ``Gullah Gullah Island'' is the first little-kid show
set in an African American nuclear family.
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon also scores big with hard-to-satisfy older kids in
the 6- to 11-year range. A lot of the shows are smart and
innovative, as well as fun. Nickelodeon's hip-hop, sketch comedy
``All That'' is often way funnier than ``Saturday Night Live'' and
has better musical guests, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We debunked a lot of myths about kids' television _ that boys
wouldn't watch shows starring girls, that you couldn't make scary
shows without delving into a lot of violence,'' said Nickelodeon
president Herb Scannell. ``And we did it by knowing our audience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clarissa Explains It All,'' starring Melissa Joan Hart, was an
instant hit with boys and girls, and ``Are You Afraid of the
Dark?'' spins scary mysteries without a drop of blood.
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon's edgy cartoons sparked the animation renaissance of
the '90s. Besides ``Rugrats'' and ``Ren &AMP; Stimpy,'' there are
``Rocko's Modern Life,'' ``Aaahh!!! Real Monsters,'' ``Hey,
Arnold'' and ``Angry Beavers.'' The titles aren't just clever; the
shows are, too.
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon is one of the good things that's happened to
children's television at a time when kids don't have much (besides
PBS) to look forward to. Kids have always gotten short shrift in
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a big advertising sector _ only about a $1 billion
business versus about $25 billion for adult programming,'' Scannell
said. ``It's not easy to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nickelodeon has succeeded big-time because kids love it. It
may not be broccoli TV, with only nutritious fare, but it's not
junk food, either. Think of it as a hot dog with salad.

   RECLINERS _ Five fathers ``test drive'' the latest styles of

   INTERNET-THERAPY _ DAYTON, Ohio _ If you've got a personal
problem, a computer and a credit card, Susan Wright is ready to
help. Just head to her web site _ www.advicelink.com _ fill out a
12-question survey about your troubles and offer up your credit
card number. For $25, Wright, a licensed independent Cleveland
social worker, will e-mail her counsel back to you. Witness the
birth of a service known as e-therapy or webcounseling, the
delivery of mental health services over the Internet. Its methods,
many believe, will lead to permanent changes in the field. The
question is whether that will be for the better. (Keilman, Dayton

   GARAGESALE-CLASH _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The yard sale begins
at 8, but three women dressed in cottony bright island colors show
up before 7 in the bleakest of Toyotas. They move up the driveway,
fan out like a recon patrol, look over the merchandise, which is
still being lugged out of the garage by the bleary-eyed homeowner.
One of the early shoppers spies a small cast-iron garden pot
bearing a $10 price. She lifts the pot, turns to the hostess of the
yard sale. ``Fifty-cent.'' ``Fifty-cents?'' says the homeowner, her
tone saturated with incredulity. ``It's marked ten dollars.''
``Fifty-cent.'' The homeowner shrugs. Her posture and facial
expression say ``no dice.'' She turns to another early customer.
The lady with the pot says nothing, puts the pot down, moves on to
a pile of children's clothes. She picks up a little dress, marked
$2. ``Fifty-cent,'' but nobody's listening. Why is no one
listening? A Haitian made the bid, and frankly, there is an uneasy
truce between newly arrived immigrant shoppers and longtime area
residents who hold garage sales. It's simple, really. One culture's
buying customs clash with the selling customs of another. (Reid,

ostrich is cooked with dried dates and service alongside yucca root

 &HT;    Reds glad to have Mighty Casey's bat
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Sean Casey's deep blue eyes flash under his tousled
hair and he speaks in his gee-whiz conversational tone no matter
where he is, what he is doing or to whom he is talking.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after his 34-inch, 32-ounce bat tore a path of
destruction through Kansas City for two days _ 10 hits that
included two home runs, a double and seven RBIs _ Casey thought
about last weekend's series against the Cleveland Indians and it
was as if somebody dropped a concrete block on his size 12 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you realize that if I were still in the Cleveland
organization I'd still be playing at Triple-A Buffalo?'' Casey
said. ``That's the truth. Since I can only play first base and they
wouldn't let me be a designated hitter, I'd still be playing in the
minor leagues because they have Jim Thome and Richie Sexson.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Casey and the Cincinnati Reds, the Indians
needed a starting pitcher and reluctantly traded the 24-year-old
first baseman for Dave Burba less than 24 hours before Burba was to
pitch Opening Day 1998 for the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of shuffling off to Buffalo, Casey is dealing in
Cincinnati _ a league-leading batting average.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were criticized for the trade and ripped for giving up a
guy like Burba for a rookie,'' manager Jack McKeon said. ``But you
have to know what you are getting and we knew.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Jim Bowden drew laughter when he said the day of
the trade, ``This may go down as the best trade the Reds have made
since we got Joe Morgan from Houston (1972). Then he put Casey in
the same playing class as Tony Gwynn, Robin Ventura, Jeff Bagwell
and David Justice.
</P>
<P>
   And now? It may go down as the best trade the Reds ever made,
The Trade of the Century.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't come around often like this guy,'' McKeon said.
``We were fortunate to get him and I'm fortunate to get to manage a
guy like this. I've had some good hitters in my time _ four real
good ones in Tony Gwynn, George Brett, Tony Oliva and this guy and
they all rank right up there. I can't separate them because they
all have their strong points.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that I don't know where we'd be without him,''
McKeon said.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins when Sean Casey was a pudgy 14-year-old kid and
a freshman in high school. Casey, always a star in youth leagues,
found himself sitting on the bench his freshman year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't understand it,'' Casey said. ``I thought, `Am I not
good enough to play high school ball?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The message registered later. The baseball coach also was the
wrestling coach. The kid who played first base ahead of Casey was a
wrestler. Casey didn't wrestle, so he found himself pinned to the
bench, but not down-and-out on the mat.
</P>
<P>
   A chat with his father, Jim, changed his life. Hard work, dad
said, was the answer.
</P>
<P>
   He purchased his son packets of 40 tokens, fifty cents a token
for 12 baseballs at the Grand Slam, USA batting cages in Bethel
Park, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit every day after school, every day. Never missed,'' Casey
said. He and a friend, Tony Raspanti, wore out the machines.
Raspanti took it a step farther and began seeing a batting
instructor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me? I already knew it all. I'm a man of the world,'' Casey
said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   His mind changed three weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, Tony couldn't hit worth a dump, he was awful,'' Casey
said. ``Three weeks after his first lesson, Tony came out raking,
hitting missiles. I was stunned.''
</P>
<P>
   It was time to see dad, again, because if batting instructor
Frank Porco could work miracles with Tony Raspanti, what could he
do for Sean Casey?
</P>
<P>
   Jim Casey gave his son $15 for a trial half-hour lesson to see
if Sean liked it and if it worked. It was a $15 investment in one
huge future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned more about hitting in that half-hour than I had
learned my entire life,'' Casey said. ``Without Frank Porco, I may
have played in college, but that's it. It was all about using your
hands to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Every Monday, 7 to 7:30, Casey worked with Porco, $15 a pop.
``Then I'd take what I learned from him and hit at Grand Slam, USA
in the cages for seven hours,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Casey consults with Porco often and he knows Casey's swing by
rote.
</P>
<P>
   ``One look and he knows if anything the least little bit is out
of whack,'' Casey said. ``Dad was right. Hard work paid off, but
hard work with Frank Porco paid off even more.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, there have been no slumps _ a three-month odyssey of
line drives that avoid defensive players as if radar is stitched
inside the baseballs.
</P>
<P>
   The effervescent, gregarious Casey loves people as much as he
loves the sweet feel of a double reverberating off his bat.
</P>
<P>
   He never says no to a writer, a broadcaster, a fan or a parking
meter. He'll talk to anybody and smile as he does it.
</P>
<P>
   Every media person wants large chunks of his time and the aim is
to explain The Sean Casey Phenomenon. One writer said she was in
town to do the, ``The definitive Sean Casey story.'' Can't be done.
There is too much to this guy.
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Aaron Boone listens to the interviews and puts his own
twist on Casey. ``Great personality, can really rake, end of
story,'' Boone said.
</P>
<P>
   On the field, in the batters box, in the dugout, Casey talks and
talks and talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to holler at him to get his attention,'' McKeon says.
``He'll have conversations with umpires, runners at first base. I
yell at him from the dugout, `Just take the guy out to dinner and
talk to him.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Captain Barry Larkin isn't one to spread praise easily. Show
him. Earn it. It didn't take Casey long and the attention Casey
soaks up brings no jealousy out of Larkin, who merely sees a
germinating superstar who makes the Cincinnati Reds dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Casey is successful at such a young age because he gives
himself a chance on every pitch,'' Larkin said. ``A lot of guys
give a half-hearted swing and when you ask them what they were
thinking, they say, `I was thinking fastball away and it was a
fastball in and I still swung.' I couldn't do at his age what Casey
does.''
</P>
<P>
   Examples of Casey's zest for major-league life and his unforced,
honest aw-gee demeanor abound.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon believes before Casey leaves Cincinnati he'll leave the
impact and the imprint of Pete Rose, without the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be the most popular guy outside of Pete Rose in
Cincinnati and he has a chance to supplant Rose,'' McKeon said.
``He has charisma, personality, attitude . . . he is a fan favorite
already. He is always smiling, always having fun. He is like an
All-American Boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He outwardly enjoys the game, you can see it,'' McKeon adds.
``He never comes to the park grouchy or mad at the world. Nothing
bothers him.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey is just a big kid _ a big kid with a big bat, a big heart
and a giant future. Everything seems a delight to him. Even a
children's Reds jersey with his name on it.
</P>
<P>
   He and fiance, Mandy Kanka, were walking in a Cincinnati mall
when they passed a shop with a display of children's Reds jerseys
in the window, C-a-s-e-y on the back.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a thrill,'' Casey said. ``Mandy said, `Hey, look at
those.' We went in and bought some for Mandy's nephews and nieces.
I'll tell you what, that was one of the biggest thrills of the
year.''
</P>
<P>
   And he meant it.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, another mall. This one in Phoenix when he and
Mandy spotted Tony Gwynn eating lunch. Said Casey, playing in the
Arizona Fall League at the time (1997, a couple of months before
his trade to the Reds), ``I know people don't like to be bothered,
so I waited until he was done eating and told him, `Mr. Gwynn, I
play in the Arizona Fall League. I really enjoy watching you play.
I really admire you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn didn't know Casey from a hot tamale that day in Arizona,
but after watching him go 4 for 4 with a home run in the first game
against the Padres this year, Gwynn knows who he is, ``A kid who
can really hit and knows what he is doing up there. I like him, but
I'll like him a lot better when he isn't playing against us.''
</P>
<P>
   He reads his Bible every day and even though there is Sunday
chapel in the clubhouse, home and away, he rushes from the hotel
for the nearest cathedral on the road.
</P>
<P>
   His strongest epithet is, ``Dang it.''
</P>
<P>
   He is a turn-the-other-cheek guy and a
do-unto-others-as-you-want-them-to-do-unto-you person.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father impressed in me that I should always treat people
the way I want them to treat me,'' Casey said. ``And he always told
me a man is only as good as his word, but those were on days he
wanted me to mow the lawn.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Eddie Taubensee is a devout man, a guy capable of
spotting a phony like a bank clerk checking a $100 bill for red and
blue threads. He says Casey is the real deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see and hear is real, nothing fake, nothing phony,''
Taubensee said. ``I liked him from the start and the more you see
and hear from him, the more you like him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds like what they see and hear, especially for the
$220,000 it cost. It's a price that will rise quickly and
dramatically and Sean Thomas Casey is one baseball player who
almost will be worth every quarter.

 &HT;    Spurs' Johnson a USBL (Sting)ray of hope
 &HT;    By Dave George
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Go back exactly 11 years. It is
mid-June, so steamy that birdbaths bubble. In a Palm Beach County
motel room sits a pro basketball player, his eyes on the NBA
playoffs, his dream captured inside a 19-inch TV screen. Truly the
United States Basketball League, a summer option for players who
just won't quit, is death by disassociation.
</P>
<P>
   No one back in 1988 would have associated Avery Johnson with the
NBA Finals. Then he was a sometimes-starter for the USBL's Palm
Beach Stingrays. The leap was just too far, the concept of playing
before 100 somber spectators at the West Palm Beach Auditorium too
bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   No one back in 1988 would have associated Avery Johnson with
Magic Johnson, three times an NBA Finals MVP. Same surname,
different galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when the San Antonio Spurs take the court Wednesday for Game
1 of the NBA Finals, it will be Avery Johnson pounding the ball up
the court as a trusted associate of Tim Duncan and David Robinson.
It is mid-June in 1999 and everything has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Everything except the heat and the humility.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this profession, people have mistreated me but I still love
them,'' said Johnson, who came to the Stingrays as an undrafted
free agent who played at three colleges and rode the bench in high
school. ``I don't hold grudges against people who made those
decisions. Those decisions benefited me.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, too, to the coaches and personnel people who kicked
Johnson around the NBA. At the conclusion of that one glorious
Stingray summer, the skinny 5-foot-11 kid with the squeaky, cartoon
voice went from Seattle to Denver to San Antonio to Houston to San
Antonio again to Golden State and to San Antonio once more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy for him,'' says a voice you would never associate
with the glory of San Antonio's current post-season run. ``He had
to take a lot of roads to get where he wanted to go, just like a
lot of athletes have to do. That's the main thing, to stay busy, no
matter what the league is, no matter what the money is. Hopefully
it will pay off.''
</P>
<P>
   The voice belongs to George Banks, a second-round draft pick of
the Miami Heat in 1995. Since then he has played professionally in
Italy and Greece and Israel and the CBA, too. Today Banks lives in
a Howard Johnson motel near Lake Worth beach, passing the time
between games with the Florida Windjammers of the USBL.
</P>
<P>
   The Windjammers' offices are in St. Petersburg and their games,
advertised by word-of-mouth alone, are played at the Palm Beach
Community College gym. Twelve home games have come and gone very
quietly since the season opener on May 1 and one remains, June 23,
against the dreaded Kansas Cagerz. Banks will be there, regardless
of whether anyone else is. He is one of just four players who have
been with the Florida team all season.
</P>
<P>
   This is the hiccuppy history of the USBL, yet Banks prefers to
focus on the fact that Avery Johnson played his first pro games in
Palm Beach County. New York Knicks' Charlie Ward and Chris Childs,
they're USBL veterans, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see anything as being all that bad,'' Banks said. ``I
see all this as a learning experience for me, learning how to play
pro-style, having fun every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell him you can't get there from here. Don't tell him
anything at all. It's mid-June and Avery Johnson, who once sweated
out a seemingly pointless summer with the Palm Beach Stingrays, is
in the NBA Finals.

TKACHUK GIVES THUMBS UP TO SMITH'S PICK FOR COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Everybody take a chill pill and relax.
</P>
<P>
   That was Coyotes captain Keith Tkachuk's advice Tuesday, a day
after it was learned a relatively unknown NHL assistant will become
Phoenix's new head coach.
</P>
<P>
   His name is Bobby Francis and he'll be introduced as the
Coyotes' coach at a 1 p.m. news conference Wednesday in Scottsdale.
Terms have not been disclosed, but it is believed Francis has
agreed to a three-year deal worth at least $350,000 a season.
</P>
<P>
   Like most players, Tkachuk didn't have the foggiest idea that
General Manager Bobby Smith would settle on Francis, 40, who has
spent the past four seasons in the Boston Bruins' organization, the
past two as an assistant to Coach Pat Burns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard something was going on yesterday, but Bobby (Smith)
called me this morning and told me who he was bringing in,''
Tkachuk, the team's three-time All-Star left wing, said Tuesday
from his summer home near Cape Cod, Mass. ``I don't know much about
him, but he's been around for a while and if Bobby (Smith) thinks
he can do the job, he must be a good coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, he's worked for Pat Burns and Pat Burns is one of the
greatest coaches in the world, so the guy's got to be decent.''
</P>
<P>
   Some players, however, privately seemed to be pulling for
Coyotes assistant John Tortorella to get the job. And more than a
few indicated they expected to be somewhat consulted by Smith
before a final decision was made, mostly just to gauge their
interest and opinions.
</P>
<P>
   When they were not, some were disappointed. A few were upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should they be upset?'' Tkachuk said. ````I'm'' not upset.
Look, they don't make the decisions. That's Bobby Smith's choice
and he's got the hardest job in the world. I've got no problems
with the way he's gone about things. You know, sometimes players
get too involved anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Why Smith earmarked Francis, who has only his two years with the
Bruins as experience behind an NHL bench, remains a mystery that
will begin to unfold during today's press conference. For now, both
Smith and Francis are declining interview requests.
</P>
<P>
   After it was confirmed Monday that he had the job, Francis still
sidestepped the issue when contacted by the ``Boston Globe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they've expressed some interest,'' he said of the
Coyotes. ``I talked with Bobby a couple of weeks ago and he
suggested that I was a candidate, but I haven't heard anything
beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he had to have some idea he was about to become the
Coyotes' third head coach in four years because he finalized
contract negotiations earlier that same day.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins backup goalie Rob Tallas, who played for Francis for two
seasons at Providence, R.I., in the American Hockey League, when
Francis was the head coach there, didn't play dumb when asked about
his friend's future in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so happy for him,'' Tallas told the ``Globe.'' ``That's
excellent. I'm really fond of him.''
</P>
<P>
   So must be Smith, or he wouldn't have tossed Tortorella from
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate about John,'' Tkachuk said, ``because John's
a great guy and all along, after (Jim Schoenfeld) got fired, I
thought they were going to name Tortorella. A lot of us did, I
think. But players can wish and want all they want, but ultimately,
it's not the players' decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is important what the players think, especially about the
direction their club is heading. To many in the NHL, the Coyotes
are a nice, little hockey team with a pretty good roster that can
compete, but not really challenge for a Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that is because the club operates in the bottom third of
the league in payroll and is generally perceived as still being a
few talented players away from competing with teams like Dallas,
Colorado and Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're heading in the right direction,'' Tkachuk said.
``We made a lot of positive strides last year. We're going to have
a new coaching staff again and obviously, it's going to take some
time to adjust, but we'll be ready. It depends on the situation,
the players, some contract stuff that usually surfaces during the
summer, but I'm looking forward to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we were still playing.''
</P>
<P>
   If they were, Schoenfeld would still be coaching. &QL;

   About a year ago, a judge in Texas issued a summary judgment to
stop the distribution of Quicken Family Lawyer '99 in that state.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can quote me: This is sick,'' said Ann Stephens, president
of PC Data, a company that tracks the sale of software for personal
computers. ``Boy, these lawyers are sticking up for their own,
aren't they?''
</P>
<P>
   The battle is still going on, although not all lawyers are
``sticking up for their own.'' Rulings banning legal-help software
have been overturned on appeal. And about two months go, the
Supreme Court of Texas told the state bar's grievance committee,
which has been trying to run legal self-help software out of the
state, to stop hiding behind secretary rulings that no longer
apply.
</P>
<P>
   Nolo Press, a company that distributes self-help books and
software, said the ruling was a major victory and something it had
requested in previous pleadings.
</P>
<P>
   While lawyers argue, legal software keeps getting better and
better. Software companies have been producing such programs for
about a decade now, and they're building on experience.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't to say that you shouldn't consult with an attorney.
Nor does it mean that all wills can be drawn up using $30 software
and be able to withstand the attack of an irate nephew cut from the
inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   Quicken Family Lawyer 2000 Deluxe goes beyond simple will
making. It contains thousands of documents, but narrows down the
ones needed through a series of interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The program ($30; Windows) has an estate-planning section and a
``plain language'' law dictionary with more than 7,000 legal terms.
A book, ``The Complete Idiot's Guide to Wills and Estates,'' is
also included. The program also has a multimedia section where
Harvard Law School Professor Arthur Miller answers frequently asked
legal questions.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the documents included are: wills (eight basic
circumstances, including with or without children); consumer
(complaint letters to companies, credit card lost or stolen, small
claims worksheet); landlord/tenant; credit; health and medical
(living wills, organ donation, Medicare peer review); family and
personal; and government letters.
</P>
<P>
   An estate planning section allows custom plans tailored to
specific needs. Estate planning tips pop up each time a user goes
to the estate-planning section.
</P>
<P>
   It provides additional suggestions on which documents may be
helpful in protecting an estate, gives advice on how to avoid
probate expenses and has a guide for calculating net worth.
</P>
<P>
   For those with a small business, Quicken Business Lawyer 2000
Deluxe ($40; Windows) offers both legal documents and more than
1,000 business letters for business owners.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM contains business and marketing plans, cash-flow
projection work sheets, and lease agreements. (If all these don't
help out enough, there's a bankruptcy work sheet available, too.)
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Broderbund, the company that acquired the
Quicken line, said there were 11.6 million people in the United
States who reported self-employment earnings in 1995; the average
small business spends between $5,000 and $15,000 a year in legal
fees.

<P>
   WOODINVILLE, Wash. _ Wilbur ran away one day last summer.
Distraught, Debbie and Jim Pittman tried everything to find him.
They put up ``lost dog'' fliers on hundreds of telephone poles, and
they checked with nearly every pound around Puget Sound. Nothing.
``But we never gave up hope,'' said Mrs. Pittman. ``We knew he had
his microchip.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, out of the blue one recent day, 11 months after the black
Labrador disappeared, a call came. ``My heart leapt,'' said Mrs.
Pittman. ``I 911'ed Jim on his beeper right away. I told him,
`Honey, Wilbur's coming home.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Pittmans' dog had been found, and a scan by Hooterville, a
local pet shelter, turned up the tiny microchip that had been
implanted inside Wilbur when he was a puppy. Embedded in the chip
was a 10-digit number linked to a national database with
information about the dog, including the Pittmans' telephone
number.
</P>
<P>
   The microchip involved in Wilbur's high-tech, homeward-bound
journey is not new gadgetry _ as far back as 10 years ago, the
Marin Humane Society in Northern California became the first
shelter in the country to implant the chips in all animals put up
for adoption and since then, the technology has reunited more than
1,000 pets _ 820 dogs, 340 cats and one rabbit, to be exact _ with
their owners there.
</P>
<P>
   But the practice has taken off in recent years, as the three big
manufacturers have tried to overcome proprietary squabbles and move
toward an industry standard, and as many humane societies and
veterinarians have urged pet owners to implant their pets with the
identification devices.
</P>
<P>
   At least 1.6 million American pets now have these chips in their
shoulders and dozens of shelters, including the n one in Manhattan
run by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, have them automatically implanted when animals are
adopted.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who see all this microchipping of pets as a sign
of premillenial excess, and the Whole Dog Journal, a newsletter for
holistic dog care based in Greenwich, Conn., reported late last
year that many pet owners were bothered by the creepy `` `Big
Brother' aspects'' of the practice and refused to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is an ethical problem posed by the fact that the
microchip technology, which operates roughly like a grocery market
scanner, actually works extremely well.
</P>
<P>
   The chips, the size of a grain of rice, implanted painlessly and
within seconds, could be used in humans, posing obvious
invasion-of-privacy issues versus some very real benefits: no more
baby mix-ups in the hospital, a powerful new tool to track down
kidnapped children, runaway teen-agers, or even deadbeat dads.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pittmans are just happy to have Wilbur home.
</P>
<P>
   Just what happened to the dog in the past year, and to the
old-fashioned dog tags that had been around his neck, remains a
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Wilbur seems to have been well-cared for. A few weeks ago,
Wilbur apparently ran away again, and he was found wandering around
a park-and-ride station in Bothell, which, like Woodinville and the
Pittmans' hometown of Redmond, is just east of Lake Washington in
the Seattle area.
</P>
<P>
   Two youngsters who found Wilbur took him home. ``The kids said,
`Maybe there's a microchip inside, let's have him scanned,' '' said
Mrs. Pittman, a nail specialist for a salon in Kirkland, Wash. `The
mother said, `I've never heard of it, but OK' ''
</P>
<P>
   Many shelters now implant the chips for free or a nominal fee.
They still recommend traditional identification tags as part of a
``belt and suspenders'' approach to pet protection, said Stephen
Zawistowski, senior vice president and science adviser at the
ASPCA.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike tags, which can fall off or be removed, or tattoos, which
can fade or be covered up as hair grows, the microchips are
virtually unalterable.
</P>
<P>
   The chip technology was first used in this country to monitor
salmon, and has been used for wildlife research and to counter
ostrich rustling. But it has caught on for domestic pets, spurred
in part several years by a bizarre epidemic of kidnappings of pets
for ransom that garnered wide attention in Southern California. In
one 1993 case, a widow in Corona del Mar agreed to leave $2,500 in
a phone booth for the safe return of her toy poodle, Ginger.
</P>
<P>
   Early last year, the Los Angeles Department of Animal Services
announced that it would like to see every pet in the city
microchipped as part of a campaign to reduce the 60,000 times a
year when it had to euthanize stray or lost animals, although
officials said they would not require the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something spooky about it,'' a senior official said
at the time, ``and everyone realizes it.''
</P>
<P>
   The implants so far are still in just a fraction of the 120
million domestic dogs and cats in the country. But spokesmen for
the companies that make the three main products in use _ HomeAgain,
Infopet, and Avid (for American Veterinary Identification Device)
_- say they believe use of the chips will take off as more and more
people become aware of them and scanning of lost animals becomes
standard practice.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every day, somewhere in the country, pets are reunited
with their owners because of the chips. In Marin County, where all
field services trucks are equipped with hand-held scanners,
``people are so grateful, they'll say this saved my cat or my dog's
life,'' said Jason Willett, a spokesman for the humane society.
</P>
<P>
   Wilbur, for one, is back home at the Pittmans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take him to the dog park, and he won't go 20 feet without
turning around and looking for us,'' said Mrs. Pittman of her dog,
who will soon be 2 years old. ``He's always checking. Now he
doesn't want us to leave his sight.''

MORE VIRUS ATTACKS EXPECTED AS WORLD GROWS MORE CONNECTED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By ANDREW J. GLASS  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A new generation of destructive computer viruses
like the ExploreZip ``worm'' that struck last week exposes the
vulnerability of an increasingly networked society.
</P>
<P>
   While diligent computer users can protect their data, experts
said, the prospect is for more widespread and frequent disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   The new virus, which is spread through e-mail attachments, is
the third major bug to sweep through cyberspace since late March,
when the Melissa virus overwhelmed systems with floods of messages.
An even more damaging virus named Chernobyl struck in late April,
but it did most of its harm overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ExploreZip, experts say, combines Melissa's propensity to spread
easily with Chernobyl's vicious payload. It may have infected
hundreds of thousands of personal computers, forcing many firms to
unplug their Web servers from the Internet and disrupting
communications and commerce across the planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a proliferation of these viruses,'' said Tommy Wald,
president of Netforce Technologies Inc. in Austin, Texas, which
specializes in data recovery. ``What's complicating it even more is
that they're getting even more sophisticated. They're hard to
recover at times, and it seems they're getting harder to detect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's literally hundreds of viruses being created every
month,'' Wald said. ``A lot of it is the hacker-types that have
nothing else to do with their time and just want to see how good
they are. The biggest reason behind it is notoriety and ego.''
</P>
<P>
   With the rapid spread of computer technology through the
business world and into American homes, the number of virus writers
has grown dramatically. Anyone who has taken a basic computer class
can adapt a virus and add his _ or rarely, her _ name to it.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of people write such software bugs, and why do they do
it?
</P>
<P>
   Virus writers ``are in love with doing harm for its own sake,''
said Bruce Sterling, the author of ``Hacker Crackdown,'' a study of
the subculture. ``They poison the digital wells and the flowing
rivers. They believe that information ought to be poisonous and
should hurt other people. Internet people build the networks for
the sake of the net, and that's a fine and noble thing. But virus
people vandalize computers and nets for the pure nasty love of the
wreckage.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet not every virus writer can be labeled as an evil,
technophobic prodigy.
</P>
<P>
   The author of the Melissa virus turned out to be David L. Smith,
30, of Eatontown, N.J., a highly regarded programmer for an AT&AMP;T
subcontractor.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Altman, Smith's attorney, says his client never intended
to do harm, and that he has been wrongfully portrayed as a
dangerous computer hacker and has been victimized by Washington's
crackdown on high-tech crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The computer world is a world where people do things,
experimental things, just about every day,'' Altman said. ``Nothing
he did, or intended to do, had a premeditated or wrongful intent.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not a crime to write a virus. Rather, the criminal offense
is to damage someone else's computer or the data stored on it, or
to incite others to spread viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Gordon, a British researcher who has written extensively
on the subject, said that ``while many virus writers are motivated
by bad or even criminal intentions and desires, it is dangerous to
assume that this is true of every person who ever writes a program
that can be classified as a virus.''
</P>
<P>
   However diverse the group of virus writers may be, the rapid
rise of the Internet has vastly enlarged their ability to cause
serious damage. Even some of the Internet's greatest champions now
question whether this increasingly powerful tool is truly safe.
</P>
<P>
   In the pre-networked era of the early 1980s, many stand-alone
users of personal computers failed to take software viruses very
seriously. One computer pioneer argued at the time that most
reported virus incidents were an urban myth, like alligators in New
York City sewers.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when most computers were self-contained universes, one
simply rebooted the machine to execute an anti-virus program that
searched for bugs and quashed them.
</P>
<P>
   But in the networked world, protection is more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Modern computer viruses can attack your computer without your
even knowing it, warned Jeff Carpenter, team leader at the Computer
Emergency Response Team, at Carnegie Mellon University's Software
Engineering Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are introduced,'' Carpenter noted, ``when you take some
action, such as opening up a document, executing a file or a
program you obtained somewhere ... when you double-click on an
E-mail attachment or on an infected floppy disk.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ExploreZip incident, the FBI issued a warning against
opening any suspicious E-mail attachments.
</P>
<P>
   Like common cold germs, today's Internet-borne computer viruses
come in many mutations. Some are simply annoying, while others can
be embarrassing or highly destructive.
</P>
<P>
   Software experts sort malicious bugs into categories known as
Trojan horses, viruses and worms. ExploreZip has hit the jackpot by
showing characteristics of all three.
</P>
<P>
   Like a Trojan horse, it masquerades as an innocent program: a
self-extracting compressed-document file that relies on a user to
launch it. Like a virus, ExploreZip finds a home on a target
system, restarting itself whenever the system reboots. And like a
worm, the program uses network facilities to propagate itself
without relying on further user action.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The best way users can protect themselves from Internet bugs
like ExploreZip is to quash them before they can do any real
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Howard, an anti-virus expert for Ziff-Davis, a computer
magazine publisher, lists some essential precautions that should be
followed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Always be suspicious of E-mail attachments. Do not open them
without first scanning them for viruses.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you own anti-virus software, make sure it is up to date.
Most software houses are able to issue remedies within days of a
new major attack.
</P>
<P>
   _ With the latest program installed, run a full virus check of
your computer every time you turn it on.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stay informed about the latest developments. Since major virus
strains are often quickly copied, the name of the infected
attachment might readily change.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens when all these precautions fail, and another
undetected agent strikes from cyberspace?
</P>
<P>
   As a comment posted on an Internet chat group last week put it:
``If you make it idiot-proof, they will make a better idiot.''
</P>

University of Nevada, Las Vegas, is by almost any standard an
outstanding young scholar. His dissertation adviser at Columbia
University, Isser Wolloch, called him ``certainly one of the very
best students I've had.'' The dissertation committee, Wolloch said,
judged Brown's thesis on the status of French writers during the
Enlightenment ``extremely original, creative, insightful.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brown is in trouble. His pioneering monograph, based on new
sources, has been turned down for publication by several university
publishers because, they said, its focus is too narrow and it would
not sell.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is not alone. Caught between growing pressures on
university publishers to make money and shrinking library budgets,
young professors in fields ranging from military history to ancient
Near Eastern studies can't get their work turned into books.
</P>
<P>
   Now help is on the way. Over the last five years, the New
York-based Andrew W. Mellon Foundation has spent $20 million and
teamed up with university presses, colleges and influential
scholars to try to publish monographs on the Internet as a way of
disseminating research and provide a place for young scholars to
publish so they can get tenure.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation awarded $744,000 to the American Historical
Association this year to publish prize-winning history
dissertations. Columbia University Press will administer and
publish the books on a Web site. The project, dubbed Gutenberg-e,
is aimed at expanding the definition of scholarly publishing. For
the first time thousands of pages of source material and archives,
upon which the dissertations are based, would be available to
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the AHA plans to award six $20,000 fellowships to
recent Ph.D's in endangered fields, like African or South Asian
history, European history before 1800, military history outside the
United States and colonial Latin America, so they can revise their
dissertations into books and put them on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to, I hope, create a new kind of scholarly
book,'' said AHA president Robert Darnton, a leader in the effort
to publish books on the Web.``The whole landscape is being
transformed, the landscape of scholarly life in general.''
</P>
<P>
   Unpublished monographs mean more than a disappointed author. The
monograph is the cultural capital of scholarship. It is, by
definition, original research, usually on a narrowly focused area,
to make a significant contribution and stimulate further study by
other scholars. It is essential for obtaining tenure and as a
building block for future research.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most serious obstacle to online monographs is
legitimacy. Scholars need to distinguish between a book that is put
on the web by the geeky boy next door and one that is judged worthy
by a committee of scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Hopeful that publishing big-name scholars on the Web will help
gain acceptance for online publishing, the American Council of
Learned Societies, an umbrella group that oversees scholarly works,
has applied to Mellon for $3 million to publish works by senior
scholars on the Internet. The council hopes its proposal will be
approved at June's board meeting of the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good idea, almost a necessary idea,'' Edmund
Morgan, a professor of history at Yale University, said of the
project. He is writing an introductory essay to the papers of
Benjamin Franklin, which are being published on CD ROM. ``I
wouldn't have any objection to it going online.''
</P>
<P>
   One well-known historian who is also considering publishing a
work with the council's project is Bernard Bailyn, a professor at
Harvard. ``I am proposing to publish the Jefferson lecture I gave
in Washington in that form,'' he said. ``I'd like to see what you
can do with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Darnton said he intended to publish a book and archival material
on 18th-century France online as part of the council's project.
Princeton University, where Darnton teaches, has contributed some
money to putting his research on the Web. ``What I think is crucial
is for scholars to take the initiative in setting standards and
basically mastering this new medium so that it works to the general
advantage of scholarship.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anyone suggests that electronic publishing will replace
academic presses. Even Darnton plans to publish a shortened form of
his work in hardcover. But advocates say it could supplement
traditionally published books and relieve some of the pressure on
scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the Mellon projects suggests that online
publishing may increase hardcover sales. The Mellon Foundation gave
an additional $360,000 to Columbia University Press in 1997 to put
works on international affairs online. Columbia International
Affairs Online (ciaonet.org) has 40,000 pages of conference
proceedings, papers and books online, with 2,000 pages of material
being added monthly. The service has 170 subscriber institutions.
Columbia expects it to be self-supporting with 200 subscribers by
September, said Kate Wittenberg, the editor in chief of the press.
``We have seen no decline in hard sales,'' Ms. Wittenberg said.
``In fact there's been a slight increase. We think people are
browsing and then purchasing.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of Pennsylvania, in conjunction with Oxford
University Press, is also using $218,000 of Mellon money to try to
create a digital library of history books for use on the
university's internal network, to see whether digitalization
affects sales of hardcover books.
</P>
<P>
   Young scholars have been caught in a double squeeze. On one side
are the struggling university presses, which are losing their
university subsidies at the same time they're being pressured to
make a profit. Originally established solely to publish
dissertations, more and more of these presses are picking up books
that have been rejected by commercial publishers, who prefer to
focus on potential blockbusters.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many university presses have stopped publishing books on
certain subjects that aren't big sellers. ``There are whole periods
of European history we don't do at all anymore,'' said John
Ackerman, the director of Cornell University Press. ``We don't do
political and diplomatic history. We focus on women's history,
psychoanalysis, intellectual history. Those still do OK
</P>
<P>
   ``Across the board we try to do fewer and fewer of this kind of
book, first books, revised dissertations,'' Ackerman said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side are the libraries that have traditionally
bought scholarly books. A generation ago, libraries might have
guaranteed a sale of 1,000 copies of Brown's book. Today they would
probably only ask for a few hundred copies. Although budgets at
many university libraries have stalled, the price of scholarly
journals has not. An annual subscription to the Journal of Brain
Research, which comes only with a package of other journals about
the brain, costs $15,203, for instance, up nearly 50 percent from
1995. The Journal of Comparative Neurology cost $13,900. Fifteen
years ago the typical university library spent 50 percent of its
budget on monographs and 50 percent on journals. ``Now it's about
35 percent for monographs versus 65 percent,'' said Peter Givler,
president of the Association of American University Presses.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Association of Research Libraries, library
purchases of monographs have declined 25 percent since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Of course that doesn't mean younger scholars have given up
trying to attract a traditional publisher. ``Most graduate students
don't think about what's sexy,'' said Joshua Landis, an assistant
professor at the University of Oklahoma, whose book on why Syria
failed as a democracy after independence won the Malcolm Kerr Award
from the Middle Eastern Studies Association, the top award in his
field. Landis has had little difficulty getting a contract with
Oxford University Press to write a general history of Syria. But it
is his monograph that is giving him trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Landis said his monograph is being considered by a press and he
is making revisions to try to broaden its scope. He said: ``My
publisher's immediate reaction was how do we justify such a short
time span? Can't you make it bigger?''
</P>
<P>
   Brown complained, ``We have been playing by the rules all along,
and now the rules have changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not confined to junior scholars. Carla Hesse, a
professor of French history at the University of California at
Berkeley, is the author of one scholarly work, ``Publishing and
Cultural Politics in Revolutionary Paris,'' and the editor of
another, a volume of essays. She is co-director of the editorial
board of the University of California Press. ``I've always had a
fantasy of writing a little monograph on French revolutionary
editions of Rousseau,'' Ms. Hesse said, ``but I know I would never
find a publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I haven't done it.''

WEB LANGUAGE CAN SPELL TROUBLE IN HTML
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: When I send e-mail to someone on America Online, they tell me
they get strange markings and the sentences are broken up. ``BSP''
is at the end of each sentence. Question: Do I have to do something
different when sending e-mail to someone on AOL? I use Netscape
Communicator as my browser and e-mail program.
</P>
<P>
   A: Newer e-mail programs such as Netscape Messenger _ the e-mail
module that comes with Communicator _ and Outlook Express from
Microsoft all have the ability to compose and send e-mail in HTML,
or Hypertext Markup Language. That's the language that Web pages
are written in. So, when you send an e-mail using that feature, you
are essentially sending a Web page to the recipient.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a problem here. Many other e-mail programs can't see
HTML pages. That includes the one used by America Online and its 17
million subscribers, as well as the freeware version of Qualcomm's
Eudora, which is generally considered to be the most popular e-mail
program used on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that these programs end up showing their
recipients lots of control codes that may get in the way of what
you are trying to say. Generally, if you don't know whether or not
someone can see an HTML-based piece of e-mail, send the message in
text-only format.
</P>
<P>
   To change to text-only in Communicator 4 and later, go to Edit,
then Preferences, then Mail &AMP; Newsgroups, then Formatting. Click
the box that lets you use the plain text editor, then click OK.
</P>
<P>
   In Outlook Express 4 and 5, click on Tools, Options, Send. Click
the Plain Text option.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial version of Eudora, Eudora Pro, handles this
beautifully. You can have Eudora ask you each time whether you want
to send plain or, as this software terms it, ``styled'' text. To
enable this feature in Eudora Pro 4 or later, go to Tools, Options,
then Styled Text. Make sure the Ask Me Each Time box is checked.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Each time I compose a letter in Microsoft Publisher, I give
it a name. When I press my print key I get a box that indicates
that my printer name is ``MS Publisher Color Printer.'' If I do not
change this to the name of my real printer _ Canon BJC-250 _ I get
a box called ``Print to File'' with a file name of .prn. How can I
get my current printer to automatically be listed in the name
section instead of ``MS Publisher Color Printer''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Open My Computer, then the Printers folder. Find your Canon
printer, right-click on it and choose Set As Default.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Re: the Help Line ``turning off the modem sound'' on May 28.
Instead of turning the volume down, you can turn it off. Navigate
to: Control Panel, then Modems, Properties, Connection, Advanced
and add ATM0 to the ``Extra Settings.'' Most modems support the AT
commands.
</P>
<P>
   A: Thanks for the tip. Several readers reported that with the
steps printed in that Help Line, they still couldn't turn the modem
sound off. This should help most of them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My modem was working fine. I decided to upgrade to Windows 98
from Windows 95, and now it will not work. I've tried everything I
know. Is it possible that it will never work again with 98?
</P>
<P>
   A: Quite a few modems ``broke'' when Windows 98 was introduced,
but it was simply a matter of acquiring new drivers for them. By
now, most manufacturers have updated their drivers, so check at the
Web site of your device's manufacturer. Download the drivers and
install them. That should fix your problem.
</P>
<P>
   You can find out who made your modem by looking in the Windows
Device Manager. Right-click on My Computer, then Properties, then
Device Manager. Double-click on the Modems item to see what kind it
is.

COREL'S OFFICE SUITE A TOUGH COMPETITOR
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you believe the conventional wisdom, then the office suite
war _ like the operating system war and the browser war _ is over,
and Microsoft has won. But a funny thing happened while Bill Gates
&AMP; Co. were celebrating another victory.
</P>
<P>
   Corel Corp. has just released the slickest version yet of its
office suite. WordPerfect Office 2000 Professional nearly matches
Microsoft's latest entry, Office 2000, feature for feature, and
certainly beats it in one key area: the price.
</P>
<P>
   While WordPerfect may never dominate the office productivity
market like its DOS-based word processor once did, this new version
will do a lot to hold the line against the Microsoft onslaught, and
may win back some who've strayed from the fold.
</P>
<P>
   First, the obligatory caveat: My name is Dwight, and I am a
WordPerfect user. I've used it since DOS version 4.2, and I still
find it to be easier to use and more intuitive than Word. However,
I prefer the other components of Microsoft Office, particularly
PowerPoint and Excel, to the other applications in Corel's suite.
</P>
<P>
   Previous versions of the WordPerfect suite suffered from a
varied lineage. The Quattro Pro spreadsheet and Paradox database,
for example, came from Borland. As a result, the look and feel of
the programs were not always homogeneous.
</P>
<P>
   That's been dramatically fixed with the 2000 version. The
primary applications finally feel like they are part of a cohesive
package.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A SLEW OF APPLICATIONS
</P>
<P>
   Along with WordPerfect, Quattro Pro and Paradox, Office 2000
Professional comes with a slew of other applications. They include
Trellix 2.0, a program designed for creating documents to be used
online; Corel Print Office, for specialized printing and graphics
projects; NetPerfect, an HTML conversion program; and Dragon
NaturallySpeaking 3.0, for voice recognition.
</P>
<P>
   That last component is a key differentiator difference between
the Corel and Microsoft products. Corel is aggressively touting
voice recognition as a key part of its top-of-the-line office
suite. Yet, even though Microsoft has a close relationship with
Lernout &AMP; Hauspie, one of the premier makers of voice-recognition
software, that feature is nowhere to be found in its Office 2000
suite.
</P>
<P>
   WordPerfect Office 2000 Professional, as with the Microsoft
product, has a handy feature that lets you install only the options
you need for each application. This is good, because the
``typical'' installation is almost 300 megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   With this feature, called Install-As-You-Go, only the most-used
options are placed on your hard drive. However, all the possible
options are available via the menus. If you try to use a feature
that's not installed, you're prompted for the CD. Or, if
WordPerfect Office is installed via a network, the component can be
pulled off a server.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean that the main programs in this suite are lean
and mean. WordPerfect in particular remains a hog of memory and
Windows resources _ but it's better.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the program launches faster, loads documents faster,
saves files faster and converts between formats faster.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CONVERSIONS IMPROVED
</P>
<P>
   It also does a much better job of converting to Microsoft Office
file formats. Previous versions of WordPerfect and Quattro Pro did
a less-than-stellar job of converting to Word and Excel, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   I tried converting a variety of spreadsheet, word processing and
presentation documents. The spreadsheet and word processing files
converted flawlessly every time, and I found only minor, easily
corrected animation glitches with the presentation documents.
</P>
<P>
   One of the new features I like the best in the WordPerfect Suite
is called the Real Time Preview. As you make various changes _ font
types, margins, backgrounds, etc. _ you're shown how the document
will look before you lock in the formatting. For folks who don't
consider themselves whizzes at document design, it's a godsend. You
can see what works and what doesn't in an instant.
</P>
<P>
   Corel got its start as a graphics application company, and that
strength has finally shown up in the suite. Yes, the Professional
edition comes with the aforementioned Corel Print Office, but more
importantly the built-in graphics components of the applications
have been beefed up.
</P>
<P>
   For example, WordPerfect, Quattro Pro and Presentations all come
with the ability to search through an on-disk library for specific
images, displaying the results as thumbnails in a feature called
the Scrapbook. If you work with a lot of clip art, it eliminates
the need for a separate media-management program.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that both the Microsoft and Corel suites do is try to
make it easier to save documents as HTML files for use on the Web.
Microsoft has the edge here; it's built into each component
program. While the Corel programs will save as HTML, it's not a
perfect conversion. The NetPerfect program that comes with
WordPerfect Suite 2000 is designed for just-right conversions.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and Corel have several different configurations for
their suites, and doing an apples-to-apples price comparison of the
two up and down the line can be tough. But if you look at the
high-end versions _ Microsoft Office 2000 Premium and WordPerfect
Office 2000 Professional _ you'll see that the WordPerfect package
is a better buy. First-time users pay $499 for WordPerfect,
compared to $799 for the Microsoft product. Those who are upgrading
from a previous version pay $209 for WordPerfect vs. $449 for
Office.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, I'll take a detailed look at Microsoft Office 2000
Premium.

`Official site' too often means `corporately dull' 
By Frances Katz  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Let's talk about the Backstreet Boys and the Web.
According to a study released by the Web measurement gurus at Media
Metrix, visitors to the Backstreet Boys' official Web site at www
</P>
<P>
   .backstreetboys.com are 86.9 percent kids. Based on no
scientific knowledge whatsoever, I would venture to guess that this
86.9 percent is probably preteen, teen-age and twentysomething
female fans looking for the latest official news and gossip about
these very cool and very cute pop sensations.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking as a former teen-age girl, I have to say the Backstreet
Boys' official site isn't really all that good, and this probably
has nothing to do with the guys themselves. The fault is with the
designers, the record company and everybody who had input into the
official site.
</P>
<P>
   An official Web site for anything, whether it's the new ``Star
Wars'' movie or a NASA mission, is usually the first place people
go to when searching for something. The innocent assumption is that
an official site will be the place where fans can get the real
inside news, look at the best photos, listen to officially
sanctioned clips and, in this case, have generally a really great
time staring at pictures of cute guys and listening to their cool
songs.
</P>
<P>
   However, the folks who run the Backstreet Boys' Web site clearly
have never met any teen-age girls. For one thing, the home page
plugs the guys' latest CD, ``Millennium.'' You don't have to have a
Ph.D. to figure out that most of the girls hitting the site already
own the CD and are looking for more detailed and personal
information, maybe some pictures. Really big, really cute pictures.
Or how about interviews with the band, or something that would take
advantage of the site's official status to show fans pictures they
haven't seen and tell them things they might not otherwise know?
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Irish alternative band, The Cranberries, used
its official site as the exclusive place to buy concert tickets
online. That's pretty cool. No boring Ticketmaster sites for
Cranberries fans; they get to check out a fan page when ordering
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nobody expects the Backstreet Boys to post their home
phone numbers on the Web site, and the server would probably crash
if they even thought about offering tickets on their site. Still,
it would be nice if sites like this one, which clearly know who
their audience is, would do a better job of giving fans what they
want. The Backstreet Boys, Brittany Spears, Ricky Martin and other
pop idols ought to have figured out by now that official Web sites
are to the Internet what music videos are to MTV _ an incredible
promotional vehicle if used right.
</P>
<P>
   The Backstreet Boys' official site has chintzy pictures (too
small, too hard to see and not labeled, so you can't even tell
where the guys are performing). Hard copy teen magazines do an
incredible job of describing every move, every twitch and every
last harmless detail of teen stars and celebrities, and they sell a
lot of magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The Backstreet Boys don't need to reinvent the wheel, they just
need to understand what their fans want to see. Alison's Backstreet
Boys Wonderland (www
</P>
<P>
   .geocities.com/SunsetStrip
</P>
<P>
   /Backstage/1823), a site built by a loyal fan, is a far better
site. Organized Yahoo!-style by various topics, including
biographies, song lyrics, the latest news and, best of all, really
big pictures, it has a ``gee aren't these guys cool'' tone that
really captures how much fun it is to read about your favorite
stars and stare at their pictures.
</P>
<P>
   What can be learned from a very brief tour of Backstreet Boys
Web sites is that the official site isn't always the best site.
When it comes to entertainment on the Web, sometimes fans can do a
better job of giving other fans what they want than the corporate
entities often responsible for the ``official'' sites.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, there was a woman named Bonnie, I think, who
was a huge fan of MTV's ``The Real World.'' For the uninitiated,
``The Real World'' is a popular series that throws seven strangers
into a very snazzy, trendy house in a trendy city, turns on the
cameras and lets the roommates go at each other. Bonnie's site had
cast photos, weekly plot summaries, ``where are they now''
information, bits of gossip almost always verified before they were
posted and an archive of past seasons. For ``Real World'' fans, it
was a wonderful site. However, as the years wore on, Bonnie's
interest in the show waned, and she decided not to keep up with
``The Real World'' any more.
</P>
<P>
   MTV decided to pick up the slack and offers a ``Real World''
area on its Web site that looks a bit like Bonnie's but is much
more corporate. The focus is less on the fun and more on promoting
the show so more people will watch it. That's where fan sites are
far superior to official sites in many cases. They don't have to be
told that TV shows, movies and rock stars are entertainment with a
focus on fun.
</P>
<P>
   If a user comes to a Web site called Backstreet Boys.com or
StarWars.com, they are clearly looking for fun. Publicity is nice,
but people will turn up at the concert, the movie theater, the
record shop and the toy store if the corporate types who build
official Web sites could remember that entertainment is meant to be
just that_ entertaining.

Computer adventure: Wiring a home network 
By Gerry Yandel  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When's the last time you found yourself installing
computer hardware with a drill?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I was using a 3/4-inch router bit, which does a great
deal more damage than a normal drill bit. Of course, I wasn't doing
anything inside my computer. Instead, I was standing in the frame
structure of my soon-to-be house with several boxes of Cat 5 cable
preparing to wire an ethernet network in the walls. I had done my
homework.
</P>
<P>
   I talked with one of the LAN pros at the AJC, who assured me
there was nothing to worry about as long as I kept my cables 6
inches away from the electrical wiring and didn't have any cable
runs longer than 300 feet. I also conferred with my father-in-law,
Bill, who sells telephone systems. He cautioned me not to make any
sharp turns, angles or bends in the wire as I laid it out through
the house, and he suggested following the phone lines as much as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   I chatted up the brother-and-sister team that was wiring almost
everything else in my house _ phones, alarm system, electricity,
cable TV, thermostats _ and I picked up a few pointers while
watching their technique. To be in the proper frame of mind, I had
even gone back into the Wired magazine archives online and dug up
Neal Stephenson's mesmerizing 56-page epic about the world history
of wire and the huge backbone cables lying across ocean floors that
make the Internet possible.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, nobody told me to bring a ladder.
</P>
<P>
   So I'm not Bob Vila.
</P>
<P>
   There are many good reasons _ among them the ability to share
files and programs, hard drive space, printers and Internet access
_ for using a network inside your home.
</P>
<P>
   My motives were a little more pedestrian: I initially decided to
put the network in so I wouldn't have to put cable modems, at $40 a
month each, on three computers.
</P>
<P>
   As I did my research, other benefits became obvious. With a
network, I wouldn't have to put a bunch of new hardware into the
old 486/SX2 that my daughter got from her grandparents _ she could
just use devices across the network. (Of course, using the CD-ROM
would mean she'd have to run between rooms to pop discs in and out
of the drive. But she's young and full of energy.)
</P>
<P>
   So _ with my ladder _ I was physically and mentally ready.
</P>
<P>
   While re-reading Stephenson's excellent article, my own wire
adventure began to take on a more profound and meaningful purpose,
like it was a metaphor for the infrastructure of life. But, after
sweating it out for a couple of hours in 90-degree heat, crawling
among the rafters, pulling cable, banging my shins and wiping
sawdust out of my eyes, I didn't care if it was the key to the
universe as long as I finished before dark.
</P>
<P>
   The process is really quite simple. In fact, a large part of it
is just mapping the network through your house. I tracked the paths
of my wires beam by beam to each room in the house, which avoided
dozens of nasty little surprises and tricky maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
   One good tip: No matter if you are wiring a house frame or an
existing house, start in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Decide where your hub is going to be and work outward. Surfing
some Web sites with how-to pages on network wiring, I found there
are two kinds of networks and two primary network layouts. Either
type of network _ peer-to-peer or client-server _ works for home
networks, but that's a topic for a future column.
</P>
<P>
   A ``backbone'' network layout, a straight line of coaxial cable
with computers coming off the sides, is more suited for businesses
with a lot of terminals. Home networks typically use a ``star''
layout, which has a hub and terminals radiating outward on
telephone-type wires. (Actually, I may have created a third
configuration called the ``Silly String'' layout.)
</P>
<P>
   The cable comes in various categories, based on the data they
can push. Ordinary telephone wire is Cat 2 and has two pairs of
wire inside the cable. Cat 3 cable can also be used for an ethernet
and is capable of up to 10 megabytes, and Cat 5 cable _ which is
four pairs of wire _ is capable of up to 100 megabytes. (The plugs
for my Cat 5 cable ends are basically the same as phone jacks, only
bigger, and will require different wall plates.)
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the two ethernet speeds aren't interchangeable. And
mixing them requires special switching hubs that are, naturally,
more expensive. But 10 megabytes should be plenty fast for a home
network. Don't forget that cable modem access, the speediest
available, hits only 3 megabytes _ although I've heard from plenty
of cable modem subscribers who say actual and advertised speeds
vary greatly.
</P>
<P>
   Putting the hub near your source of Internet access _ a
telephone jack or cable TV outlet _ should make things easier. I
added an extra cable jack about 6 feet up on the laundry room wall,
after some alert readers sent e-mail about possible moisture and
temperature extremes in the garage, my original location. I'm also
putting in a shelf for the cable modem, the hub and a small
computer to use as a server, if I need it.
</P>
<P>
   I did end up finishing my job before dark. My eight cables came
together in a beautiful thick bunch that follows one of the big
pipes through the upstairs bathroom floor along the ceiling over
the washing machine.
</P>
<P>
   The Monday after my wiring job, my wife stopped by the house to
check its progress. A new subcontractor, who was wiring my light
fixtures, asked if we were doing some of our own wiring work. When
she told him I had wired up a computer network, he said, ``Well, he
sure knew what he was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's profound enough for me.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   Screwdriver PC postscript: According to my e-mail _ which was
filled with tales of frustration _ many readers have been victims
of shoddy service from screwdriver PC shops. Surprisingly, almost
every person's problem was with the same outfit. My advice still
stands, no matter which one you buy from: Buyer beware.

World Book on DVD fails to forge proper links 
By Jack Warner  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ IBM's venture into the world of DVD, the 1999 World
Book Family Reference Suite, is a pretty good tool hampered by
exceptionally poor organization.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than simply expanding upon the entries contained in the
paper version of the World Book Encyclopedia, IBM opted to fill out
the vast space afforded by DVD-ROM with the Merriam-Webster
Dictionary and the latest Information Please almanac.
</P>
<P>
   This was a pretty good decision _ especially for kids struggling
with homework. The Merriam-Webster dictionary is always active, and
one need only double-click on any word in an article in the
encyclopedia to get a complete explanation of it.
</P>
<P>
   There is lots of multimedia, including especially good movie
clips in fairly large format. Strangely, every last one of them
seems to be silent. There are lots of sounds, just not moving
picture sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Musical illustrations for the great composers are adequate in
number, although disappointingly brief. They are, however,
presented by the appropriate instruments rather than a synthesizer
or MIDI translation.
</P>
<P>
   I checked my usual out-of-the-way articles and found them
accurate, if not very enlightening. Longer, more mainstream
entries, such as that for Australia, are quite adequate for most
purposes, including homework, and well-written.
</P>
<P>
   There was even a brief separate entry under didgeridoo,
explaining that it is a musical instrument of the Australian
Aborigines. This is good, because only a few electronic
dictionaries include it. I was disappointed not to find a musical
example linked to it, which leads to my chief complaint about World
Book.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever branch of the publisher charged with organizing the
material and providing cross-links appears to have been permanently
out to lunch. There is, in fact, a musical example of the
didgeridoo. You can find it in the general article on Australia. I
can think of no reason why it wasn't also included with the brief
article on the instrument itself.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of thing abounds. The article on flamenco offers no
examples. Yet the article on Spain, under arts, provides two aural
examples, portions of a fandango de Huelva and tientos. The former
is listed as a ``traditional fandango'' (it is not) and the latter
as a ``traditional dance.'' I supposed that whoever put together
the section simply didn't know much about it, but this sort of
thing is far too endemic throughout the book to be accounted for
that way.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if you ask for information on the Second Amendment
to the U.S. Constitution, World Book provides the text of it and a
discussion of the controversy surrounding it. If, however, you ask
for the Fourth Amendment, all you get is an article on wiretapping
which mentions the amendment in passing without giving its text.
</P>
<P>
   All the articles are signed, which is good. Some are written by
big-time experts in the field at issue; most are relatively
obscure.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, navigation is simple, although if you have
been browsing through articles and decide you want to look at a
list of videos on the disc, you're going to find you can't get
there from here. At least I couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to go through the ordeal of ``teaching'' the
software how you speak, or if you have difficulty typing, you can
even navigate with IBM's ViaVoice technology and a provided
microphone.
</P>
<P>
   The search list hides the icon that indicates what multimedia
items, if any, are associated with an article. You wouldn't even
know it's there unless you look.
</P>
<P>
   There are ``wizards'' to help with things like Web pages and
homework, and a timeline feature which most users will find next to
useless because of its lack of organization. There is the
obligatory online link, but in this case obligatory is quite apt.
Unlike Microsoft Encarta, for instance, relatively few articles are
linked to Internet information, even when a wealth of it is
available.
</P>
<P>
   Information Please is a useful almanac for lists and records and
so forth, as well as 1998 events.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot to like about World Book. The pity is that if it
had been given the kind of organizational attention that every
other electronic encyclopedia has, it would be outstanding.

MORE OF THE SAME FOR DISNEY ONLINE CHIEF  
 A BIT OF FLAMBOYANCE FOR AN INTERNET CONFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LAURIE J. FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After seven years at Walt Disney Co. developing new Internet
businesses, Jake Winebaum has decided to call it quits to do
something different. His goal? To develop new Internet businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The 39-year-old head of Disney's Buena Vista Internet Group
resigned last week to form a start-up incubator, Ecompanies, along
the lines of the entrepreneur Bill Gross' Idealab, which has
overseen the creation of dozens of thriving Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Winebaum, along with Sky Dayton, the 27-year-old founder of
Earthlink Network Inc., said that at Ecompanies he would focus more
on the start-up and operations of the businesses rather than the
initial ideas.
</P>
<P>
   There are currently at least 150 Internet start-ups, operating
on venture capital, that are seeking chief executives, Winebaum
said. He suggested that the number of ideas had outpaced the
availability of management skill.
</P>
<P>
   While Idealab, which started Citisearch and Goto.com, casts a
wide net in its search for start-ups, Winebaum said Ecompanies
would focus its activities more narrowly.
</P>
<P>
   Winebaum and Dayton met at an industry conference two years ago
and discovered they had something in common besides a passion for
start-ups: extreme snowboarding.
</P>
<P>
   They have been snowboarding together ever since, often
discussing start-up ideas on trips.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks ago, Winebaum called Dayton to say he was
thinking of quitting Disney to focus on one of his ideas. Like
Winebaum, Dayton was ready to start all over again, having seen
Earthlink, an Internet access provider, grow to $176 million in
revenue last year.
</P>
<P>
   Winebaum and Dayton hold majority stakes in Ecompanies, while
Disney and Earthlink are investors, an arrangement that will give
the two entrepreneurs the kind of control they both miss. The next
step is to find someone to oversee the company's venture-capital
fund. ``Sky and I both really like the start-up phase,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Winebaum joined Disney in 1992 when it acquired his magazine,
Family Fun. From there, he started several online ventures for
Disney, including Disney.com.
</P>
<P>
   A Bit of Flamboyance for an Internet Conference
</P>
<P>
   What has Dennis Rodman got to do with the Internet industry?
Until this week, almost nothing. But on Thursday, the flamboyant
professional basketball star will take the microphone at the Web
Attack Internet marketing conference in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tchong, producer of the conference, said he hoped to get
Rodman to talk about his coming electronic commerce venture, which
Tchong stumbled upon in the course of a trademark search on the
term Webzilla.com. The search turned up Rodman's venture,
Rodzilla.com.
</P>
<P>
   The point of inviting Rodman to the conference, Tchong said, is
to illustrate to Web marketers that they need to be outrageous to
be heard above the noise. ``There's got to be hundreds of pro
basketball players today, but ask anybody to name two and they'll
say Michael Jordan and Dennis Rodman,'' Tchong said. ``Now that's
brand marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman has not been asked by the conference organizers to make
any prepared remarks. But he has been instructed on precisely what
to wear. The contract for his appearance requires Rodman _ who
apart from his hair color is perhaps best known off the court for
donning a wedding dress and other outrageous attire _ to wear a
T-shirt bearing the logo of Iconocast, the Web marketing consulting
company that is sponsoring the conference.

SEEKING WAYS TO CUT THE WEB-PAGE WAIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In high-tech business circles, people often talk about how
things happen faster in ``Internet time'' _ deals are made faster,
technology changes more rapidly and companies succeed or fail in a
much shorter time frame.
</P>
<P>
   But for most consumers, ``Internet time'' is a much slower
concept _ the often interminable wait for a Web page to show up on
a computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   The bottleneck is bandwidth _ the capacity of Internet services
to deliver Web pages and other data to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce companies, while constantly adjusting to operating at
lightning speeds to keep pace with Internet technologies, must
reconcile themselves to the fact that their customers are living in
what amounts to slow motion on the other end of the line. As a
result, these businesses have to make difficult decisions about how
to attract and keep customers within the limited bandwidth
available.
</P>
<P>
   For all the growth experienced by e-commerce sites in the last
year, ``speed is still clearly a limitation,'' said Cliff Sharples,
founding chairman of Shop.org, an e-commerce trade group, and chief
executive of Garden.com, a gardening supplies site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to quantify the business we're not doing because of
it, but I'd have to say it's pretty significant,'' Sharples said.
</P>
<P>
   Cable and telecommunications companies are working furiously to
deliver high-speed connections to more consumers, but in the
meantime, Internet retailers are not sitting idly by.
</P>
<P>
   For one, they have put an emphasis on designing pages that load
quickly. E-commerce executives and site designers say they
generally try to adhere to the eight-second rule _ after eight
seconds of waiting for a Web page to load, consumers become much
more likely to abandon the effort. But no matter how strenuously
online businesses work to reach or exceed that goal, they often
fail, especially with users who connect at home through dial-up
modems.
</P>
<P>
   According to Nielsen/Netratings, which measures Internet
audiences, home users had to wait an average of 28 seconds to load
Web pages of the 109 most visited e-commerce sites last month. And
Keynote Systems Inc., an Internet performance measurement firm,
reported that business users wait an average of eight seconds to
load each page, typically through faster T1 lines.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce executives across all categories know they must beat
those times or face an exodus of customers. Jonathan Morris,
executive vice president of Bluefly, a discount apparel retailer,
said the need for a fast site forced the company to change or delay
the development of certain features. ``There are things we could do
that we're holding off on because it might adversely affect the
consumer's experience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the company had a zoom feature, which allowed
customers to look more closely at a product's fabric _ an important
capability, because a computer screen cannot convey fabric texture
nearly as well as a catalog can. However, Morris said users
``didn't love the feature, as it did put an additional strain on
our servers'' and subsequently slowed the service.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting such features, he said, gives the company more chance to
employ a sophisticated database that can track inventory as a user
enters the site and can serve registered customers images of items
they might like. On a site already heavy with graphics, such a
system could slow page loads long enough to lose a customer. ``It's
a balancing act, maybe more in our category than others,'' Morris
said.
</P>
<P>
   That balancing act applies to other aspects of Web design as
well, said Andrew Sather, senior vice president of Sapient, an
Internet design and consulting firm. Bandwidth concerns, he says,
force Internet companies to make hard choices about optimizing
their sites to appeal to certain customer groups, such as those
with higher-speed connections, while possibly alienating users who
connect at lower speeds.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Sather says that Sapient recently designed the
Virgin Megastore Web site (www.virginmega.com), ``and we optimized
it for a higher-end user.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We made assumptions _ about things like screen resolutions,
browser, modem speed _ that were pretty ambitious,'' he said,
``because the company wanted to push the envelope with what they
could do on the site.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the site is heavier on graphics than, say,
E(ASTERISK)Trade, another site Sapient designed. ``With
E(ASTERISK)Trade, you want to cater to the super high-tech day
trader,'' Sather said, ``but also the older couple who are dialing
in with an antiquated laptop from an RV somewhere in the Grand
Canyon.''
</P>
<P>
   Sather said that among the e-commerce categories hurt by slow
connection speeds are those that are ``more lifestyle-intensive,
such as anything trying to target the youth culture with moving
images _ that sort of thing.'' In such cases, he said, ``there's
more competition for bandwidth between product presentation and
lifestyle presentation, but at some point you have to be King
Solomon, and split the baby and decide.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For other e-commerce categories, too, a sluggish Web ``can have
serious economic impact,'' said Jack Staff, chief economist at Zona
Research, an Internet research firm. ``Those most at risk are the
sellers of apparel, where visual presentation is so important, and
technology products that require more explanation on the pages,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce sites willing to spend money can, however, find ways
to increase speed without making compromises on site design. For
instance, through applications developed by companies like Akamai
Technologies, Staff said, sites can cut the time it takes to
download a page to a range of half to a tenth of the usual time.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai generates a global map of Web traffic conditions and
serves the pages of client Web sites over the most efficient route,
using more than 600 servers on 25 networks in Europe, the United
States and the Pacific Rim. David Goodtree, an Akamai spokesman,
said the service cost between ``a couple of thousand and tens of
thousands of dollars'' a month, depending on the traffic served,
and its clients include Yahoo and Apple Computer, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Such technologies may be crucial even if companies like
Motorola, Sun Microsystems, Cisco Systems and AT&AMP;T succeed in their
quest to deliver faster connection speeds to Internet users using
digital subscriber telephone lines and cable modems within the next
few years.
</P>
<P>
   But even if they do, the increase in bandwidth may continue to
be canceled out by an equal or greater increase in the number of
Internet users, cautions Fritz Mueller, director of product
marketing for Keynote Systems. That, in turn, could leave
e-commerce companies precisely where they are today: hoping for new
technological breakthroughs as they scramble to make the experience
worth the customer's effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like disk space,'' Mueller observed. ``No matter how much
you get, you use it up.''

DATA `BROKER' DEFENDS USING FALSE PRETEXTS TO GET PRIVATE
INFORMATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When he entered the private investigation business
nearly 20 years ago, James J. Rapp opened a company to do
surveillance and other things that he did not want to talk about,
particularly because its name, Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, aptly
described its operations.
</P>
<P>
   Now Rapp, a 39-year-old investigator who used to promise on his
Web page that he could quickly get anyone's private telephone
records or bank account balances for as little as $100, is in the
middle of legislative, regulatory and criminal battles over how
much privacy millions of Americans should enjoy when they go to the
bank or make a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp has made a career of posing as the person whose records he
is trying to uncover, to trick banks, telephone companies and other
institutions into revealing confidential information sought by his
clients. The practice is known in the trade as pretexting, and it
has drawn a lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission that names
Rapp, his wife, Regana, and their company, Touch Tone Information
Inc. A trial date has not been set, although Touch Tone has agreed
to honor a preliminary injunction barring the investigative
practices that are at issue in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is billed by both sides as a landmark case, and Rapp
is receiving significant support from a coalition of information
brokers and debt collectors who see the government's action as a
potential threat to their livelihood. But even some of his allies
are uneasy about using Rapp as the vehicle to avoid new and tougher
government privacy rules, because he has a criminal record and
served a four-year prison sentence for theft.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Rapp has also been discussed in Congress as
lawmakers in both the House and Senate, with the support of the
Clinton administration, are trying to make such investigative
techniques a federal crime and impose new civil liabilities on
practitioners of the art of deceiving banks. He is being
investigated by a grand jury in Colorado under a new state law that
makes it a crime to use deceptive practices to obtain private
information.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate lawsuit filed in 1996, he was alleged to have
helped a client, the International Beverage Corp., obtain telephone
records of a competitor, Saybrex International, from AT&AMP;T as part
of an effort by International Beverage to learn who Saybrex's
customers were. Saybrex, a family-run liquor exporter in Beverly
Hills, Calif., ultimately successfully sued the competitor _ though
not Rapp, who was not named as a defendant in the suit. Saybrex,
however, was unable to force AT&AMP;T to tighten its procedures for
handing out customer records.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent series of interviews, Rapp and his lawyers said
there was nothing inherently wrong with using trickery to get
confidential information, particularly since that information is
often not otherwise obtainable. They also said that Rapp had
cracked many cases in which deception was the only way to find
money for victims of crimes and neglect, like abandoned spouses and
children, and for plaintiffs in lawsuits who were unable to collect
judgments, and for insurance companies and banks that had been
defrauded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message that the government is sending in its case is that
if you're a deadbeat dad, you don't have to worry any more,'' Rapp
said. ``After all, how else are you going to get at this
information?''
</P>
<P>
   Rapp has his defenders, and is even cited as an exemplar by an
industry group of investigators and debt collectors who so far have
been moderately successful in watering down proposed legislation
and obtaining significant loopholes for certain kinds of cases,
such as tracking down assets for child support payments. The group,
the Coalition to Amend the Financial Information Privacy Act, is
paying for Rapp's legal defense in the FTC case _ and using him to
help raise money for its lobbying efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition's members maintain that the practice of pretexting
is no different from what police officers or some journalists do
when they go undercover or assume false identities in the course of
doing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the information brokers say that publicly available
data bases and computer services offer a variety of information
about people and their finances, including their Social Security
numbers, the prices they paid for their homes and any existing
liens. They note that other information, like bank deposits, can be
obtained when necessary through a court subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   But Rapp and his supporters say that information like bank and
telephone records is generally not publicly available, that it can
change quickly during the time it takes to get a judge's order, and
that the only way money can be recovered in many instances is by
duping a financial institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``What our clients are trying to do is even the odds,'' said
Stephen C. Leckar, a lawyer at the Washington firm Butera &AMP;
Andrews, which is representing both the coalition and Rapp. ``If
some people don't pay their bills, investigators like Rapp are just
leveling the playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   But the FTC sees it as privacy issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Touch Tone's pretexting is a particularly pernicious invasion
of consumers' privacy _ using deception to gain access to
sensitive, private financial information,'' Robert Pitofsky, the
FTC's chairman, said. ``This case should send a strong message to
information brokers that the FTC will pursue firms that use false
pretenses at the expense of consumers' privacy and also create
opportunities for economic injury to consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The banking industry is caught in the middle. On the one hand,
it has publicly denounced the deceptive techniques and called for
some new legislation, although it has also tried to make sure that
any new laws do not create new liabilities for the banks that might
be too quick about turning over confidential information. On the
other hand, many of the clients of investigators like Rapp have
been banks seeking to collect delinquent loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's little question that some banks will hire information
brokers,'' said John Byrne, a senior counsel at the American
Bankers Association and an expert on privacy issues. ``We have
tried to emphasize that banks should ask questions about how they
are getting information and that there are legitimate means of
getting at the same stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Court papers in both the Saybrex and FTC lawsuits describe Rapp
and his employees as using fake telephone numbers and phony
corporations to deceive banks or telephone companies into turning
over confidential information.
</P>
<P>
   In the FTC case, transcripts of calls to banks that were
recorded as part of the government's surveillance revealed Touch
Tone employees pretending to be doddering customers in order to
obtain Social Security numbers and other information, like the
maiden name of an account holder's mother. In some cases, bank
representatives declined to help. But in others, they guided the
Touch Tone employee to the correct answer and even supplied
information like account balances.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Private investigators familiar with the deceptive practices of
information brokers say another common technique is the ``Trojan
check.'' The broker sets up a dummy corporation and sends a check
for a small amount of money to the target of the investigation
either as a supposed rebate or award. When the target deposits or
cashes the check, information about the target's bank account is
imprinted on the canceled check. The broker can then use that
information to approach the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation and legal fights come as Washington has become
captivated by privacy issues and the rights of consumers and the
businesses that hold their confidential records, from insurance
companies and hospitals to banks and telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, the House Commerce Committee inserted a variety
of consumer privacy protections into the latest version of
legislation to overhaul the nation's banking system. Those
proposals, which were endorsed by consumer groups and include a new
right to sue companies that violate their customers' privacy
rights, threatens to undermine broad industry support for the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say it is not clear whether the broadly worded existing
federal fraud laws would permit the criminal prosecution of a
person who deceives an institution to gain access to private
information, which is why Congress may act this year to make the
law more explicit.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On the Web pages and court papers of the coalition supporting
Rapp, he is portrayed as a victim of an overzealous federal agency,
an agency that if it prevails will make it more difficult for
abandoned wives and their children to find desperately needed
assets of their deadbeat dads.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Rapp has become the industry's poster boy for what
the coalition has called a ``witch hunt'' by federal regulators, it
turns out that he has had his own more serious difficulties with
the law.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp served four years in prison in the 1970s and  &UR; ' &LR; 80s in
Colorado for theft, which was a violation of his probation on an
earlier conviction for auto theft. State records in Denver show
that in 1992 he pleaded guilty to impersonating a peace officer. He
and his wife have had more than $38,000 in tax liens imposed by the
federal government for failing to pay taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's using him as their symbol ``is like bankers
embracing Jesse James,'' said Marshall B. Grossman, a Los Angeles
lawyer who represents Saybrex.
</P>
<P>
   Because he is a man who has made a career out of deception, it
can be difficult to sort through the substance of many of Rapp's
claims.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He said in an interview that the investigations and the poor
health of his parents had driven him out of business in recent
weeks, a business that he said had annual revenue of about $1
million for the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   He said there was nothing wrong with employing deception to get
at private information and that his clients over the years had
included banks, tabloid newspapers and television programs. He
asserted that he had probably trained half of the nation's
information brokers, had solved ``over 100 cases a day'' and that
he worked for private investigators hired to get information for
news organizations about the families of the victims of the
Columbine High School shootings in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he had done work for agents at two field offices of
the FBI, but he refused to provide any references or say anything
more about the work.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his assertions could not be verified.
</P>
<P>
   He also asserted that he had received an ``associate's degree''
in criminal justice from Metropolitan State College in Denver. But
Carrie Schafer, the communications director for the college, said
school records showed that Rapp had attended the school but did not
complete enough courses to earn a degree.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And while Rapp has had no qualms about using trickery to obtain
confidential information on behalf of his clients, he so values his
own privacy that he was hesitant to be photographed for this
article.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live way out in the county and no mail comes here,'' he
said. ``Everything is quiet. That's the way I like it. Nice and
quiet and easy.''

A HIGH-TECH STRATEGY FOR ROLLING WITH THE PUNCHES

 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As high-technology business strategies go, it was a classic,
perfectly executed: find a technological ``discontinuity,'' race a
new product to market and dislodge an entrenched competitor.
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely what Greg Galanos, the founder of the tiny
software company Metrowerks Inc., did in 1991. Realizing that Apple
Computer and Motorola Corp. were allying with IBM to shift to a new
microprocessor chip called the Power PC (the discontinuity), he
quickly developed a type of software tool known as a compiler (the
new product) for use by programmers writing software for Apple
Macintosh Power PC computers.
</P>
<P>
   When the dust settled, Galanos found that his Code Warrior
compiler software had a 95 percent share of the market for Apple
Macintosh programming tools. The dislodged competitor in this case
was the larger, less nimble Symantec Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately there was just one flaw in the strategy:
Metrowerks had seized the commanding lead of a shrinking market.
The grand alliance that Apple and IBM envisioned never jelled, and
Apple's share of the personal-computer market began to collapse
from a peak of about 13 percent to around 3 percent, where it
bottomed out last year.
</P>
<P>
   Metrowerks' compiler software continued to play a crucial role,
enabling programmers who designed applications for the Macintosh to
convert their instructions to machine language. Trouble was, fewer
programmers were interested in creating new Macintosh applications.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, Galanos scanned the horizon for the next big
technological discontinuity. And the 41-year-old Metrowerks
president may have found it: the increasing fragmentation of
computing from its desktop-PC foundation to a new, pebbly terrain
of digital consumer-electronics devices that include video-game
machines and ``smart'' voice and data cellular telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with three years ago, when Metrowerks was developing
software entirely for the Macintosh, 60 percent of the company's
projected $30 million in revenue this year will come from sales for
software tools used to program the processor chips that are at the
heart of the consumer electronics market.
</P>
<P>
   This coming post-PC era, as it has been called, does not play to
the strengths of the software giant Microsoft, which currently
leads the esoteric but crucial market for software tools _ the
programs that programmers themselves use when creating software.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, with more than $200 million in annual tool sales, is
the leader in this field because it sells the primary tools used in
making programs for the industry-dominating Microsoft Windows PC
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   But the post-PC shift toward computerized consumer electronics
products _ which employ many different operating systems and so
require many different kinds of programming tools _ is creating a
new opportunity for a raft of smaller software tool makers.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Metrowerks, the noteworthies include Cygnus, Greenhills
Software, Imprise, Integrated Systems and Wind River Systems. But
none of these other companies offer the range of products across
different chip families that Metrowerks does.
</P>
<P>
   And Metrowerks has distinguished itself by making significant
inroads in the market for hand-held computing and wireless devices.
The company is the leading software tools vendor for the popular
Palm Pilot organizer. And Metrowerks recently struck a deal with
Motorola to provide software tools for Motorola's new Mcore
microprocessor family of chips for digital cellular phones and
similar computerized communications devices.
</P>
<P>
   Metrowerks' biggest coup, though, has come in the video-game
field. All three of the major game makers _ Nintendo, Sega and Sony
_ have announced that their next generation of game machines
scheduled for release later this year will use chips and operating
systems that rely on Metrowerks software development tools.
</P>
<P>
   Having a single software development environment is something
that is highly prized by video-game developers, who must gamble on
which system will be most popular and then be prepared to quickly
rewrite, or ``port,'' their programs to a competitor's gaming
system.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, it also means that any developer creating games
for these new machines will have to use Metrowerks tool kits. It is
perhaps the most valuable validation yet for the strategy that
Galanos and Metrowerks are now pursuing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the business of creating developer communities around
post-PC devices,'' Galanos said in his office in Cupertino, Calif.
``The games business is defining the software industry today.''
</P>
<P>
   Metrowerks' strategy is a concept akin to Microsoft's practice
of offering outside programmers the company's applications
programming interfaces, or APIs _ computer-code pathways into and
out of the operating system to which programmers connect their
software.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying this idea to consumer electronics, Metrowerks is now
finishing work on a tool kit _ called Powerparts _ that is supposed
to make it simple to adapt programs for one type of device for use
on another device, as well as offering programmers a library for
quickly creating visual control panels for consumer devices. A
scheduling program created for a hand-held electronic organizer,
for instance, might be easily translated to a version used on a
smart cell phone with a screen.
</P>
<P>
   With Metrowerks having established its bona fides in the
Macintosh tools market, and now gathering steam in the post-PC
market, Galanos is finding enthusiastic supporters from many parts
of the computer industry _ particularly among executives who like
nothing better than to see upstarts flying successfully beneath
Microsoft's radar.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's managed to build a software developer business in spite
of all the Microsoft positioning,'' said Eric Schmidt, chairman and
chief executive of Novell Corp., a leading network software company
and Microsoft competitor. ``And he's done it with good products in
a difficult market.''
</P>
<P>
   Although compilers are remarkably complex programs that are
largely invisible to typical computer users, they play a crucial
role in the computing world. The quality of a compiler can
determine how quickly programs run, how easy is it to write
programs and whether those programs are more or less error free.
</P>
<P>
   And a fast compiler can sharply improve a programmer's
efficiency _ no small consideration, since complex programs might
contain millions of lines of programming instructions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you impact the efficiency of software development, then you
impact time to market,'' Galanos said. ``And time to market is
everything today.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, the company's forward momentum has not carried
over to its balance sheet or stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Although revenues have followed an upward trend, Metrowerks,
which ends its financial year in July, has eked out profits in only
four financial quarters since the beginning of fiscal 1996. And any
gains have been more than offset by the losses during that stretch,
as the company has invested heavily in its new strategy. Investors,
meanwhile, have shown little appetite for Metrowerks' shares, which
were trading above $9 in early 1998, but closed last Friday at $3.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The market hasn't been good for small and micro-cap stocks,''
said David Kaminer, an analyst at RBC Dominion Securities in
Montreal. ``But now their strategy is paying off in market
positioning,'' he said of Metrowerks, ``and I expect profitability
to return soon.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to many other software wunderkinds like Bill Gates
and Steve Jobs, who embraced computers as teen-agers, Galanos came
relatively late to this line of work. At age 17, after dropping out
of high school, Galanos left his native Australia in 1974, and for
the next two years traveled by foot, bus and car in Asia and
Europe. His adventures included encountering unfriendly Khmer Rouge
soldiers in Laos in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Vientiane, and American tourists were the targets for
roaming soldiers,'' he recalled. To ease his discreet withdrawal
from Laos, he said, ``I quickly added an Australian flag to my
backpack and threw greenbacks at the soldiers at all the
roadblocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, his wandering took him to Montreal, where he settled
in 1976 and became a self-taught programmer working for the
electric utility Hydro-Quebec. While there, he became manager of
the environment department, where despite a a ban on the use of
non-IBM personal computers he orchestrated the covert rental of
Macintosh computers by the department's scientists.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the accountants discovered his ploy in early 1985,
the group had one of the largest Macintosh networks then in
existence _ some 60 of the machines.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until the age of 28 that Galanos started college,
studying computer science at the University of Quebec, in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   He became intrigued with the work of Nicholaus Wirth, a Swiss
computer scientist who invented the Pascal and Modula programming
languages, and after graduating, Galanos founded Metropolis
Computer Networks in 1986 as a company that sold a Modula compiler
to colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   The modest success of that business attracted the interest of a
French venture capitalist, Jean Belanger, who supplied $100,000 of
financing in 1989 that helped Galanos found Metrowerks as a more
broadly based tools provider _ a relationship that eventually
resulted in Belanger's becoming chief executive three years ago,
freeing Galanos, still president, to also become chief technology
officer.
</P>
<P>
   As the Macintosh tool kit started taking off, Galanos took the
company public in 1994 and subsequently moved Metrowerks to Austin,
Texas, to be closer to the locus of Power PC chip development and
to take advantage of the engineering labor pool in that emerging
technopolis.
</P>
<P>
   Several years later he set up an office for himself and a small
group of the company's best programmers in Cupertino, in Silicon
Valley, to be close to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Galanos acknowledges that the software tools market is a
difficult one. But he says he is confident that Metrowerks will
return to profitability this year, now that its new business model
is taking hold.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for his optimism has been Metrowerks' ability to
raise prices for the software tools it sells to its 150,000
licensees.
</P>
<P>
   Price pressures had been tremendous in the desktop computer
market, given Microsoft's commanding market share in both operating
systems and tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Operating-system vendors want to give away compilers to
encourage people to write applications for their operating
system,'' said Richard Smith, a software industry executive who is
president of Phar Lap Software in Cambridge, Mass. ``But Metrowerks
has a good technology philosophy of being able to build good
software and retarget to many different chips.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Galanos, having spotted the next big discontinuity, is
banking on his Powerparts strategy to turn Metrowerks into a major
player in the post-PC world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a very long and arduous task to transition from
being a Mac company,'' he said. ``You suck it in, invest a lot in
R&AMP;D, and push to make sales catch up.''

HIGH-TECH EXPORTS HIT ANTIQUATED SPEED BUMPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bad news for Chinese generals: The U.S. Commerce
Department has just determined that the new Sony Playstation II,
available later this year, is powered by an American-made chip so
powerful that Washington would have to be notified before it could
be shipped to China.
</P>
<P>
   If the final destination were a company, institute or household
linked to the Chinese military, a lengthy review would be required
to make sure America's most sophisticated technology does not fall
into the hands of bomb makers.
</P>
<P>
   But any Chinese officer determined to play out his fantasies on
a state-of-the-art Sony _ perhaps simulating a naval attack to
retake Taiwan? _ has other options. He could simply send his
teen-agers over to shop at any of the five Toys ``R'' Us stores in
Hong Kong, which is still considered a safe place to send advanced
technology even though it reverted to China two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of the Playstation is bandied about a lot in
Washington these days as one more example of how disconnected the
politics of controlling high-tech exports is from the realities of
a marketplace that reinvents itself every six months.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the disclosures about Chinese espionage, there
has been daily talk on Capitol Hill about crackdowns on the export
of American technology, not only nuclear secrets from the labs,
which everyone agrees must be locked up, but also the computing
power that would help the Chinese simulate nuclear explosions.
</P>
<P>
   The Playstation is only the tip of the chip. Over the next 12
months American computer and semiconductor makers are planning to
roll out a series of new products, with code names like Willamette
and Merced, that blow wildly past the limits Washington has used to
define a supercomputer that needs to be guarded.
</P>
<P>
   By year's end, says Andrew Grove, chairman of Intel Corp.,
``You'll be spending $1,200 at CompUSA for a computer that, if the
rules aren't changed, we may not be able to ship to China.'' Or to
Israel, Russia, India or 50 other nations subject to strict
controls.
</P>
<P>
   This leaves the Clinton administration in a bind. Just as it is
defending itself against charges of letting technology out the
door, the computer industry's top executives were visiting Capitol
Hill and the White House last week asking for a relaxation of the
export rules.
</P>
<P>
   Under their proposal, the definition of a high-performance
computer requiring government approval for export to those 50
countries would be increased sixfold to 12,300 MTOPS (millions of
theoretical operations per second) from 2,000 now. Otherwise, they
warn, Europe and Japan will eat their lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the Clinton administration agree that the current limits
are too strict given today's technology. The president could ease
the restrictions with a stroke of his pen, but he must give
Congress six months to review the decision. Nowadays, though, one
White House official lamented, ``We'd be giving ammo to anyone who
believes that we are helping arm potential enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   What the computer industry seeks is a fundamental rethinking of
what kind of technology it makes sense to control. During the Cold
War that issue seemed relatively straightforward: The most powerful
Cray supercomputers and their Japanese rivals were clearly off
limits for shipments to the likes of the old Soviet Union and
China.
</P>
<P>
   But Crays were produced in limited numbers, and when they were
sold to countries whose intentions might be less than honorable,
part of the deal was that they would be accompanied by a full-time
technical expert who, in theory, also served as a monitor.
</P>
<P>
   But the motto of last week's Silicon Valley visitors, who
included some big donors to Democratic and Republican causes, is
``Yesterday's supercomputer is today's laptop.'' They have a point:
A $20 million Cray X-MP, state of the art in the mid-1980s, had
about the power of a 1999 personal computer equipped with a
relatively fast version of Intel's Pentium II chip.
</P>
<P>
   That Pentium is, of course, passe. By the end of this year Intel
projects that a high-end Pentium III chip will perform 1,600 MTOPS,
well above the current limit for microprocessors that can be
shipped to China and similar countries.
</P>
<P>
   Then come Willamette and Merced, chips that Dell, Compaq, IBM
and others plan to put in clusters of two or four in forthcoming
machines. These computers would operate at upward of 12,000 MTOPS,
or more than six times the current threshold for export controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that there are going to be millions of these
computers produced,'' said Lewis Platt, the president and chief
executive of Hewlett-Packard, who led the lobbying effort here.
``There comes a moment when a technology is so widely available
that the kind of limits that we put in place just a few years ago
simply don't make any sense anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The two main authors of the report on China's espionage efforts,
Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., and Norm Dicks, D-Wash., sympathize
but insist it is time to revive the Cold War organization that
limited exports, the Committee on Multilateral Export Controls. It
went out of business in 1994, replaced by a weak accord that allows
most countries to ship whatever they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``Export controls remain essential because even as China has
stolen some of our most important secrets, it has not yet obtained
everything it needs to exploit them,'' Cox and Dicks wrote last
week in The Wall Street Journal. Europe and Japan, however, see the
threat differently; they worry more about America's technological
supremacy than about what happens when China gets the Merced. They
are reluctant to re-institute cold-war controls.
</P>
<P>
   That's understandable. The Gartner Group, a computer industry
consulting group, projects that within three years the Chinese will
be buying nearly 400,000 multi-processor personal computers a year,
to say nothing of Sony Playstations.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The implications of the malicious software
program that wove its way around the globe last week struck home
for Bernardo Huberman, a physicist at Xerox, in the form of a terse
voice mail he received at work on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our computer system administrators sent me a message saying,
`The worm has hit Xerox, but we've hunted it down and killed it,'
'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   To Huberman, a researcher who has studied the behavior of
computer networks for more than a decade, the biological allusions
were an apt and perhaps chilling reminder that the explosive growth
of the Internet has numerous parallels to natural systems _ and
many are not reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that we are indeed living in a computational
ecosystem which is more and more globally cross-linked,'' he said.
Or to put it more simply, ``It's an amazing system, and it's very
vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   In a world where computers, once isolated work tools, are
increasingly the very engine driving modern business life, computer
researchers say they are detecting an ominous trend toward programs
that mimic viruses and pestilence in the physical world.
</P>
<P>
   The latest focus of concern is a program known among computer
researchers as a worm. The recent one was apparently conceived in
Israel and quickly spread to Europe and the United States, mailing
itself from computer to computer and destroying its victims' files
along the way. Called Explore.exe _ for the name of the file it
contained that set off the damage _ the worm has affected thousands
of computers worldwide and forced a number of corporations to
abruptly shut their e-mail systems, in a frantic effort to control
the spread of the infection.
</P>
<P>
   Like biological diseases, which exploit the most basic mechanism
of life _ the power of DNA to replicate itself _ a subculture of
modern virus-writing now manipulates that same power of replication
within the world of interconnected computers.
</P>
<P>
   While the dominance of a single computing environment _ the one
powered by Microsoft software and Intel chips _ offers the benefits
of compatibility among machines, some say it may share the
vulnerabilities of fields planted with just one crop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The analogies are extremely close,'' said Richard Dawkins, a
biologist at Oxford University. ``When you make machines that are
capable of obeying instructions slavishly, and among those
instructions are `duplicate me' instructions, then of course the
system is wide open to exploitation by parasites.''
</P>
<P>
   Some computer scientists believe that in the rise of the
Internet and the World Wide Web, society has struck a Faustian
bargain _ gaining the potential of robotic software agents, which
can flit from computer to computer to do their masters' bidding
almost intelligently, but accepting as well the darker prospect of
software infections that can sow the destruction of cybernetic
plagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may simply be the price you will have to pay for having
the flexibility, adaptability, autonomy of this new networked
world,'' said Kevin Kelly, author of ``Out of Control: The New
Biology of Machines, Social Systems and the Economic World''
(Addison Wesley, 1994).
</P>
<P>
   Biological metaphors used to describe the hostile software are
only that, and the analogies do break down because the so-called
computer viruses are man-made, not natural, and are frequently
designed to be destructive.
</P>
<P>
   But some researchers assert that such diseases are a direct
outgrowth of the remarkable complexity emerging in the realm of
networked computers. Increasingly, they say, Internet viral issues
will come to resemble the modern world's perpetual public health
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to look at this the way the Centers for Disease
Control approach things,'' said Vernor Vinge, a computer scientist
at San Diego State University. ``There are always new problems on
their threat board.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer scientists have known about these risks since the first
worm programs were written by researchers at the Xerox Corp.'s Palo
Alto Research Center in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Experimenting with the power of networked computers, scientists
fashioned a wide variety of helpful programs, ranging from
``vampire'' worms that kept the network's computers laboring late
at night to ``diagnostic'' worms that efficiently spread software
repairs around the research center.
</P>
<P>
   But a software error in one of the lab's early worms caused the
program to run amok, crashing computers everywhere in the building.
</P>
<P>
   Today computer researchers debate what distinguishes worms from
viruses, both metaphors drawn from science fiction. The term
``worm'' first appeared in John Brunner's 1975 novel ``Shockwave
Rider'' (Del Rey Books) while ``virus'' first appeared in a
computer context in David Gerrold's ``When Harley Was One''
(Ballantine, 1972).
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the term ``virus'' has been used to describe
software codes that infect computers by attaching themselves to
documents or programs that are passed along. ``Worms,'' by
contrast, have been self-propelling, that is, a program sent within
the attachment can then send itself along without any action by the
person who receives it.
</P>
<P>
   But the most recent generation of malicious programs _ like the
Melissa virus, which spread rapidly around the world in late March,
and Explore.exe, the worm that emerged in Israel last Monday _
blend aspects of both.
</P>
<P>
   The world of computer networks has not yet produced the most
telling biological analogy _ evolution. But a particular class of
hostile programs known as polymorphic viruses has been designed
since 1993, with the ability to mutate to evade the pattern
detection capabilities of modern antivirus scanning programs.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, antivirus researchers are also turning to
biological solutions to face down hostile software codes. For
example, last month the Intel Corp., IBM and the Symantec Corp.
jointly released a new antivirus software technology they call a
``Digital Immune System.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as a biological immune system offers a systemic approach to
illness, the new software shifts the antivirus response from the PC
to an entire corporation's network, automatically relaying suspect
programs for inspection and directly immunizing individual
computers.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other attempts to build systems that are immune
from security threats. For example, the original intent of the Java
programming language was to prohibit the kind of file destruction
wreaked last week by creating a ``sandbox'' that limits a program's
destructive capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly, the rapid spread of last week's outbreak was made
possible because most of the world's users of personal computers
now run Microsoft software. The destructive program was written to
destroy documents written in widely used Microsoft applications
like Word, Excel and Power Point and certain programming files.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the classic result of a computer monoculture,'' said
W. Daniel Hillis, a computer scientist at Walt Disney's
Imagineering unit. Like agricultural ecologies that become fragile
and unstable when relying on only one or a few different crops, so
the modern computer world is vulnerable to the degree it relies on
Microsoft's software.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the worm had attacked large American military
contractors, including Boeing and General Electric, Art Amolsch,
editor of FTC Watch, a Washington policy newsletter, suggested that
the government should insure software diversity among its agencies
and contractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I propose that no government agency be allowed to run more
than 34 percent of its personal computers on one proprietary
operating system by a date certain,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To Hillis, who in the 1980s experimented with advances in
software programs using ``evolutionary'' techniques in which the
programs adapt to their environment, a transition is under way in
which computers will be viewed less like mechanical devices and
more like biological organisms, which more easily accommodate
imprecision and failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we have the fragility of an engineered system where
every part works'' but the system itself can fail, he said. ``But
in the future we're going to engineer systems with the expectation
that everything is broken all the time. That's how we treat
biological systems today.''

SENATE SUPPORTS BILL LIMITING Y2K LAWSUITS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After months of partisan squabbling, the Senate
approved legislation Tuesday that would limit lawsuits arising from
Year 2000 computer failures.
</P>
<P>
   But the 62-37 vote fell short of the two-thirds majority needed
to override President Clinton's promised veto. That means further
negotiations with the White House will be needed for the measure to
become law, as is considered likely.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would place a ceiling of $250,000 on the punitive
damages that could be assessed against companies with fewer than 50
employees, and would give all companies 90 days to solve Year 2000
computer problems before they could be held liable.
</P>
<P>
   The debate coincided with a three-day ``high-tech summit'' on
Capitol Hill, in which Republicans are eagerly trying to win
friends in Silicon Valley by pressing the case for getting the
government off the Valley's back.
</P>
<P>
   Most important for the large and wealthy computer companies, the
legislation specifies that all the companies responsible for a
computer failure would share the legal liability and that no
company could be assessed damages greater than its proportional
responsibility for a breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   This would prevent a wealthy company like Microsoft that was
marginally at fault from bearing all the damages when smaller
companies with fewer resources were mostly responsible for a
breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   What is called the Y2K problem results from the reliance of some
computers on programs that use only the last two digits of years.
Those that are not properly updated could misinterpret the year
2000 as 1900, causing the computers and electronically controlled
machinery to fail.
</P>
<P>
   While the specific legislation involves computers and the Year
2000, the underlying politics reflects the longstanding division
between business interests, which are the largest financial
supporters of Republicans in Congress, and trial lawyers, who are
among the biggest Democratic donors.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties are also fishing for political support from the
ocean of money in high-technology companies. Democrats, torn by the
conflicting claims of trial lawyers and cyberspace magnates,
insisted Tuesday that legislation would soon be enacted to protect
the computer companies from unnecessary litigation.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Republicans, at the ``high-tech summit,'' had
nothing but praise for the chairman of Microsoft, Bill Gates, and
other computer luminaries.
</P>
<P>
   Business lobbies like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the
National Association of Manufacturers have spent millions lobbying
and advertising for the legislation. The chamber made the issue the
organization's biggest legislative priority of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, big technology companies like Intel and Compaq, as
well as small ones from Silicon Valley, worked for the measure. ``I
cannot tell you the depth of passion that the high-tech industry
feels for the bill in California,'' said Sen. Dianne Feinstein,
D-Calif., one of 12 Democrats who joined 50 Republicans in voting
for the bill. Voting against it were four Republicans and 33
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing it, along with the trial lawyers, were many
organizations representing consumers, like the Consumer Federation
of America and Public Citizen.
</P>
<P>
   In the final debate, both sides painted horrific pictures of
what would happen if they did not get their way.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the chief sponsor of the bill, said
its purpose was to prevent ``an avalanche of frivolous lawsuits''
that could ``stymie the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Litigation has become big business for a segment of the trial
bar,'' he declared. ``That small group is eagerly anticipating the
bonanza that Y2K problems present in litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Without restraints, McCain said, ``the legal costs associated
with Y2K will exceed that of asbestos, breast implants, tobacco and
Superfund combined.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading the opponents was Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., who was
a trial lawyer before going into politics and who has long been the
lawyers' champion in the Senate. ``We're now going to legalize
fraud,'' he asserted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This town loves lawyers _ office lawyers,'' said Hollings, 77,
one of the few remaining senators who always speaks
extemporaneously, as old-timers did, rather than reading his floor
speeches. But Republicans, he added, have made a political sport
out of demonizing ``working lawyers _ trial lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he said, in the United States, business sets the
standard for safe products, and the reason is fear of lawsuits over
faulty products.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved a similar bill last month, 236-190, also well
shy of a two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
   Now, representatives of the White House are likely to join
negotiators from the Senate and House in the conference committee
to work out the differences between the Senate and House versions
of the legislation. A bill is likely to emerge before long,
lawmakers said, that will satisfy most of Clinton's objections.
</P>
<P>
   Among those objections are these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Hurdles intended to prevent frivolous lawsuits by companies
would also apply to individuals, making it more difficult, for
instance, for a person to collect legitimate damages if his house
were burgled after a computer problem caused his alarm system to
fail.
</P>
<P>
   _ Class-action suits would be forced into federal courts, where
the rules are generally more favorable to defendants than they are
in state courts.
</P>
<P>
   _ The proportional liability requirement could be burdensome to
plaintiffs who could not afford multiple lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, McCain seemed prepared to make concessions. ``We
will do what we can to avoid a presidential veto of this important
legislation,'' he said.

SILICON VALLEY STARTS TO WONDER WHEN THE BUBBLE WILL BURST

 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ In Silicon Valley, these are the days of
miracles and wonder.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the longest sustained boom in the nation's
high-technology heartland, there is a palpable air of unreality
that has come to color the outlook of the computer engineers,
venture capitalists and software hackers who make up the valley's
rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   Wage rates in the region are about 60 percent above the national
average and are growing far more quickly than average. Driven by
the vast new wealth created by a wave of Internet-related start-up
companies and the increasingly vast inflows of venture capital,
good times have arrived with a vengeance and have stayed longer
than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   The good times have led so many valley workers to sports car
showrooms that Raymond Lane, the president of Oracle, the giant
data base company, complained recently that he could not find the
new Porsche he wanted in Northern California; one local dealership
had a six-month waiting list. (He ordered one from a Southern
California dealer through the Internet.)
</P>
<P>
   And in meetings at power breakfast spots in Palo Alto like Il
Fornaio or Bucks in Woodside, executives shake their heads over
stories such as the one about the home in a comfortable Palo Alto
neighborhood that sold in April for $1 million more than the $2.4
million asking price.
</P>
<P>
   But indicators like those have in turn led to a growing sense of
unease among many valley longtimers who oscillate between a faith
in what has been called the ``long boom'' and the knowledge that
each of the valley's booms in the last half-century has inevitably
been followed by a bust.
</P>
<P>
   ``The valley is now divided into two camps,'' said John Shoch, a
partner at Alloy Ventures, a venture capital firm based in Palo
Alto. ``There are those people who are firmly inside a
reality-distortion field and there are the rest of us who realize
that this is going to end but who can't help going along for the
ride.''
</P>
<P>
   The talk at the restaurants and sports clubs is frequently of
the power of ``Yahoo dollars'' or ``Weimar currencies,'' the fruits
of a stock market that seems to have a bottomless appetite for
Internet start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, stock certificates have in many ways become the
currency of the valley _ to such an extent that the Menlo Park
Presbyterian Church receives a significant share of its tithing in
stock instead of money. And St. Joseph's, a Roman Catholic school
in Atherton, devotes part of its endowment to its own venture
capital fund.
</P>
<P>
   While the booming stock values have allowed companies to attract
and retain the best and brightest employees and acquire other
companies, there is also a growing perception that the excesses of
the Internet commerce boom may have permanently undermined the
valley's traditional no-nonsense, utilitarian, engineering-driven
culture.
</P>
<P>
   At the Palo Alto office of R.R. Donnelley, the venerable
printing company that publishes the financial documents known as
``red herrings'' that are a key part of the rite of going public,
the valet parking, the pool table and the cigars in a thermidor
occasion more than one raised eyebrow.
</P>
<P>
   And such is the cash rattling around that an editor at the
high-speed Internet service At Home recently purchased a new
$625,000 home on his debit card.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one consensus is that this unrivaled wealth creation has
led to a stock market bubble that will certainly end, but nobody
knows when or how.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people who are making the case that the
Internet has changed the law of physics,'' said Fred Hoar, a
longtime Silicon Valley publicist. ``But this is still a Newtonian
world, and when you throw something up in this world, it's going to
come down.''
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring that point, the book that is on everyone's lips is
not a Silicon Valley best seller like Geoffrey Moore's ``Crossing
the Chasm,'' but rather Charles MacKay's 1841 book ``Extraordinary
Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds,'' which among other
events described the Dutch tulip speculative craze of the 1600s, a
legendary example of a market mania.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, what has made the current boom so unusual is that it
has gone on for so long. It has been more than six years since the
valley has seen tough times, a fact that has caused memories here
to grow hazy and has led some longtimers here to look for ways to
cling to a past that seems increasingly distant.
</P>
<P>
   Roger McNamee, a fund manager at Interval Partners in Menlo
Park, has followed the valley's ups and downs since the beginning
of the PC era. Now he points across a parking lot at his Toyota
Camry, a modest car contrasting with the more typical turbo-charged
luxury cars. He says he hangs onto the car as a touchstone to a
world he is in danger of losing contact with.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and researchers who are trying to understand the
apparent disappearance of the valley's boom-and-bust cycle point to
the convergence of two separate trends that set the economy into a
sustained period of overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   The semiconductor industry, which has long been the bedrock of
the Silicon Valley economy, was just beginning to recover in 1993
when the demand for Internet communications gear started its rapid
acceleration. Then in 1995 the Web economy kicked in, creating a
remarkable business spiral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of it was coincident with the commercialization of the
Internet,'' said Douglas Henton, president of Collaborative
Economics, a consulting firm in Palo Alto. ``But the real growth in
jobs has been in computer networking.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, although there have been booms before, this one has
permanently altered the valley's entrepreneurial culture, in ways
that are viewed as negative by many of the region's longtimers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a corrosive effect on the valley parallel to Wall Street
in the mid-1980's,'' said Eric Schmidt, who was the chief
technology officer at Sun Microsystems before decamping to Utah two
years ago as president and chief executive of Novell. ``The level
of expectation is well beyond the norm, even in Silicon Valley.
People have very short attention spans when it comes to their
careers. It is a youth phenomenon, a new generation of
entrepreneurs who have not had to concentrate on building
institutions that endure. Moreover, the venture industry has no
longer had to build a long-term business. The corrosive effect is
in creating a short-term versus long-term way of thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   And the wild successes of Stanford students like Jerry Yang of
Yahoo or Joe Kraus of Excite have now made it common for graduates
to choose Silicon Valley start-ups first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today 75 percent of my students are joining emerging
companies,'' said John Hennessey, the dean of the school of
engineering at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   That is a sharp turn from the days when the normal career
pattern was to join an established high-technology company like
Hewlett-Packard or Intel before setting out on a start-up venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got this funny psychology in which the reality and the
unreality coexist,'' said Michael Borrus, a managing director at
Petkovich &AMP; Partners, a San Francisco investment firm. ``These kids
really believe they're going to get wealthy and this youthful
optimism is overriding the fact that maybe 9 out of 10 of them
won't have an IPO in their lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, however, an economy in which several generations of new
workers have never known anything but explosive growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the semiconductor, we've known historically that every four
years we get hit cross the lip,'' said Hoar, the publicist, who was
an early employee at Fairchild Semiconductor, a pioneering chip
maker. ``There is one group that has seen it all and they have the
scars. On the other hand you have this group that says, `Every
breath I take is golden.''' That latter view rankles some valley
pioneers like Andrew Grove, a founder of Intel, and Steve Jobs,
Apple Computer's co-founder.
</P>
<P>
   Grove said that only in the recent past had he begun to hear the
phrase ``exit strategy'' _ do we want to be acquired or aim to go
public? _ which is now routinely part of the planning for tiny
start-up ventures that may not yet have sold their first product.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not reality,'' Jobs said. When Apple started, he said,
his role models were William Hewlett and David Packard, who had set
out to build an institution rather than an overnight gold mine.
</P>
<P>
   And ignoring that reality will ultimately bring its own
reckoning, Hoar said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is one chapter that keeps repeating itself in this
valley, and that's Chapter 11,'' he said.

WITH GATES ON THE HILL, THE GOP IS ON THE MAKE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Al Gore may not have invented the Internet, but he
and President Clinton clearly perfected the skill of extracting
political contributions from Silicon Valley. Now, in a three-day
``High-Tech Summit'' on Capitol Hill, Republicans are trying to
show that they have the capacity to be even better friends of Bill
Gates and his competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning Gates, his once-sharp barbs about Washington
lawmakers replaced with deferential comments like ``you've raised
an interesting issue, Senator,'' was filled with prognostications
about how the Web, wireless networks and electronic commerce would
turn ``consumers into big winners.''
</P>
<P>
   And the members of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee,
led by Republicans, were so filled with praise for Microsoft Corp.
and its entrepreneurial ilk that they only once, and then only
obliquely, raised the uncomfortable question of how antitrust laws
were applied to the world's most powerful software company. Left
unsaid, but understood, was that it is President Clinton's Justice
Department that is pursuing Microsoft in court a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the subtext of the three days of hearings, which began
with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and ended Tuesday with
Gates' appearance, is that Republicans are eager to get the
government off the Valley's back. Sure, many actual denizens of
Silicon Valley would be happy to see Microsoft get its hand slapped
by the government. But that didn't stop heads from nodding Tuesday
when Gates talked about how keeping ``a light hand'' on regulation
of technology industries ``is working very, very well.''
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had Gates finished talking than the Senate voted to
lighten the touch even more: Over the administration's objections,
on Tuesday it approved a bill that would limit the liability of
high-technology companies for any damage by the Year 2000 bug.
President Clinton has pledged to veto the legislation, a version of
which has already passed in the House, giving yet another wedge for
Republicans who argue that the White House is the Valley's
fair-weather friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two things going on here,'' a Republican member of
the committee said after Tuesday's hearings, asking not to be
further identified. ``There are real issues we'll have to deal
with,'' he said, among them congressional hearings on Internet
privacy, data encryption, support for basic research. ``And there
are questions of political funding. Which of those goes first, that
will depend on how cynical you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates once reveled in his apolitical nature. Until a few years
ago, Microsoft maintained only a small presence in Washington,
eschewing professional lobbyists and suggesting that the importance
of what happens in hearing rooms pales in comparison to what
happens in software labs. Meanwhile the Republican leadership, or
at least those leaders without significant high-technology
constituencies, largely ceded the territory to Clinton and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday they see an opportunity. Software makers are still
haggling with the administration, and Gore in particular, over U.S.
rules limiting the export of programs that offer high-level
encryption of data _ which U.S. intelligence agencies fear will be
exploited by potential enemies. At Tuesday's hearings, Network
Associates Inc. president William Larson described how the company
is about to lose ``a seven-figure deal'' to provide such software
to Chrysler, after its new parent,  &UR; DaimlerChrysler &LR; , insisted on
purchasing programs that could be shipped around the world. The
business is likely to go to a German competitor, Larson said.
</P>
<P>
   Others used the moment to lobby for an extension of the research
and development tax break. Charles Vest, the president of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, warned against what he
termed ``growing complacency'' about U.S. high technology
superiority, noting that federal funding for basic research and
development was declining. He said that at this point ``the United
States is living off of historical assets that are not being
renewed.'' The Internet's origins lie in a system developed by the
Pentagon and used for years, largely in obscurity, by academics.
</P>
<P>
   But clearly the big draw Tuesday was Gates, who received the
gentlest of handling all around. There were no tough questions
about charges that have arisen during the antitrust trial. In fact,
there were no tough questions at all _ either from the senators or
from students who were asking questions, via an Internet link, from
university and high school projects that Microsoft is backing.
</P>
<P>
   While it was never discussed, the Republican-dominated panel was
clearly aware that Microsoft greatly increased its giving to
political causes in the 1997 and 1998 election cycles, and the
expectation is that the sum could increase dramatically for the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   The company and its employees gave about $1.3 million in
unregulated ``soft money'' over the last two years, putting them
among the top dozen or so in this category.
</P>
<P>
   It was listed as a ``table sponsor'' for the Republican
Congressional Committee dinner last week. While tables sell for
only $25,000, the move was viewed as a sign of things to come as
Republicans seek to exploit Microsoft's unhappiness with its
treatment by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has increased its permanent lobbying staff in
Washington and has also reached out to some of the capital's
longtime consultants. Among the lobbyists under contract to
Microsoft is former Republican National Committee chairman Haley
Barbour.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly two-thirds of Microsoft's political spending already
goes to Republicans, a figure that a senior employee at the
company's Redmond, Wash., headquarters said ``would probably come
as a surprise to most Microsoft employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates did everything he could Tuesday to steer clear of
controversy. He talked about forthcoming inventions that would help
members of Congress in their work, including new types of portable
digital devices that would help them ``access your own `digital
dashboard' '' even when they are out of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He banished from his vocabulary almost all his usual tech-speak,
talking as if he was giving a speech to an interested but somewhat
unsophisticated chamber of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Invited to give his views on the state of U.S. antitrust laws,
he said that ``the laws as they are currently written are fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The implication he left is that they are being wrongly
interpreted in Microsoft's case. But he carefully dodged specific
mention of the litigation, other than to say ``things like
integration of new features are one of the freedoms companies
have'' under those laws.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Microsoft case hinges on the question of whether the
company is integrating its Internet browser into the Windows
operating system in a way that undercuts the ability of competing
browsers to operate.

DIRECTOR VIEWS COMPUTER RIVALRY AS CLASSIC STRUGGLE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Pizza boxes and caffeine, bad hygiene, ill-fitting
suits and screaming fits, all bathed in the soft cathode-ray glow
of computer screens hardly seems the stuff of a classic yarn.
</P>
<P>
   Except to Martyn Burke, who thinks a certain much-celebrated
bard might have written about Apple Computers' Steve Jobs and
Microsoft's Bill Gates, had the rise of the personal computer
happened when Elizabeth I, not Elizabeth II, was queen of England.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Shakespearean nature of the story of these two men,''
said Burke, who wrote and directed TNT's ``Pirates of Silicon
Valley'' about the two ubergeeks of the computing world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's `Hamlet,' `Macbeth' and `Richard III' combined,'' Burke
said. ``There's a scene in `Richard III' where his enemies have
laid siege to all around, and he says, `My kingdom for a horse.'
That's what I thought of when I read about Steve Jobs' 30th
birthday party. Jobs is basically Richard III to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Burke is too much the veteran of Hollywood features
and documentaries to try to sell the story to development execs
without a more modern conflation of reference points.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a story that transcends all the boundaries,'' Burke
said. ``In that kind of Hollywood shorthand, it was `Diner' meets
`Citizen Kane.' There was more drama in this than I've seen in a
lot of other stuff. That was what attracted me.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the movie traces the somewhat similar upward trajectory
of Jobs and Gates from the early 1970s through the mid-1980s, Burke
said the two are substantially different kinds of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no particular ax to grind when I came to this story,''
Burke said. ``I let the story write itself on the basis of
research. Gates emerged as a guy who's completely different from
Jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The research is partly based on the Paul Freiberger book, ``Fire
in the Valley,'' as well as much other material compiled by Burke
and the film's actors, particularly Noah Wyle, who became
passionate about the role after Burke sent him a documentary cued
to Jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched 10 seconds and knew I'd kick myself for the rest of
my life if I didn't play the part,'' said Wyle, who worked
seven-day weeks to finish both the film and his starring role on
``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Michael Hall, the long-lost Brat Packer who played
Gates, called his part ``the role of a lifetime. Gates is like the
Henry Ford or John Rockefeller of our generation.''
</P>
<P>
   The portraits that emerge are of extraordinarily intense people
who through luck, brains, insane work habits, smart friends and
stupid competitors changed American business.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs is a charismatic seeker trying to fill some existential
hole in himself and driving those around him mercilessly, exhorting
them to be ``insanely great.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(Jobs) has these furies he's coping with all the time,'' Burke
said. ``He was always at a remove from everyone around him. Gates
did not personalize his furies the way Jobs would do.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke shows Jobs _ an adopted child who hires a private
detective to find his natural mother _ trying LSD and many Eastern
religions and alternative spiritual practices.
</P>
<P>
   Later, still driven but bolstered by fabulous success, his
almost classically Greek hubris nearly undid him _ and his company.
</P>
<P>
   ``As he got more power and became more of a guru in his own
right, whatever the brakes were on his behavior fell away,'' Burke
said. ``He went crazy on his employees all the time. The thing that
created the success of Apple was also the source of its problems.''
</P>
<P>
   In one particularly painful scene, the movie shows Jobs verbally
savaging a job applicant who wears the virtual uniform of IBM:
pressed white button-down Oxford shirt, conservative tie, slacks
and close-cropped hair. The man doesn't belong and will never fit
in, Jobs says.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, on the other hand, comes across as the consummate poker
player, literally and figuratively. Anthony Michael Hall, like Wyle
a ringer for his subject, plays Gates as a Machiavellian snake who
uses whatever advantage he can to win a card game _ or a business
negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he's far goofier than Jobs, having ``dates''
with venture capitalist/longtime buddy Anna Winblad where they
simultaneously would attend a movie and then, because they happened
to be in different cities, talk about it on the phone afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Gates comes off as classic nerd, but how many nerds do
you know who steal bulldozers in the middle of the night, as he did
in Albuquerque?'' Burke said. For that matter, how many geeks
commandeer their buddy's new car, go speeding through the night and
wind up in jail?
</P>
<P>
   But it's Gates' high-stakes poker mind that is most distinctive
in the film, as Gates tells his college buddies (and Microsoft
colleagues) Paul Allen and Steve Ballmer that the key to successful
negotiating is getting a person to believe they want what you have,
and only you can provide it to them.
</P>
<P>
   We see him squeeze his first computer maker to double the
nascent Microsoft's royalty payments for the operating system he
and Allen had hurriedly written in their Harvard dorm room. Without
the operating system, he tells the hardware maker, his
``brilliant'' machine is just a bunch of blinking lights in a box.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of argument worked on the big boys, too, as IBM agreed
to buy an operating system for the IBM PC that Gates and Allen
hadn't yet created. The result, MS-DOS, became the dominant system
for running personal computers, thanks to IBM's still-magic name in
the business world.
</P>
<P>
   And ultimately, Gates talked Jobs into giving him three
prototypes of Apple's crown jewel, the paradigm-shifting Macintosh.
The result was Microsoft's Windows, a new operating system that
made ugly old PCs run like a Mac without needing to be one.
</P>
<P>
   Though it took several tries (and a successful fending off of
Apple's ``look and feel'' technology infringement lawsuit),
Windows' latest versions run more computers than any operating
system in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Windows came out, that's what absolutely floored Jobs,''
Burke said. ``The one person he had trusted came back to haunt him.
Jobs had this kind of Achilles heel. He had this one area of
weakness and was looking for something. Gates, for some reason,
understood Steve Jobs better than anybody, consciously or
unconsciously.''
</P>
<P>
   Roughly $50 billion later, Gates is the world's richest man,
while Jobs first had to humiliate himself on stage before Apple
faithfuls, declaring in 1997 that the age of competition with
Microsoft was over, then trying to save the lurching company he'd
left a dozen years earlier from bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Burke doesn't admire his subjects in many ways, for all
the warts his movie shows on their public portraits.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, after a massive underestimation of the Internet's impact,
has spent billions positioning his company to dominate that area,
too. And Jobs has not only returned Apple to profitability and
hipness as its interim CEO but also owns computer animation studio
Pixar, which produced Disney's ``A Bug's Life'' and ``Toy Story''
to huge acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, he's one of the more amazing characters in American
public life,'' Burke said of Jobs. ``He proves that (F. Scott)
Fitzgerald was wrong when he said there were no second acts in
American lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft spokesman John Pinette said the movie's makers took
some substantial liberties with the historical record in making
``Pirates,'' but that the company would let viewers make their own
decision about what to believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our reaction is this is a made-for-TV movie, and that says
enough,'' Pinette said. ``In the end, it's a movie about the
graphical user interface, and you have to take some liberties to
make that interesting. We're basically going to let other people
decide its merits.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple did not return calls seeking comment on the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Burke has one final metaphor for what Gates and Jobs wrought:
Vietnam, and the American combat involvement there that was ending
just as the personal computer revolution was starting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the old days of the student radicals who were
determined to overthrow the power structure, they failed,'' Burke
said. ``And these guys, who were ignored by everybody, succeeded.
The techies, the nerds, basically undermined the way business was
done in America.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more engaging parts of ``Pirates of Silicon Valley''
is the series of culture clashes between execs of major technology
corporations such as IBM, Xerox and Hewlett-Packard in the early
days of Apple and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Where those companies (much like the American military of that
day) were heavily bureaucratic, top-down and unable to envision any
personal use for the computer, the then-tiny Microsoft and Apple
were agile and forward-thinking enough to outstrip the big
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't care about structure and hierarchy,'' Burke said.
``It was almost a metaphor of what was going on in Vietnam.
American business is kind of small-scale guerrilla warfare all the
time. HP (Hewlett-Packard) and Xerox and IBM were actually missing
the boat.''

   Stop me before I double-click again.
</P>
<P>
   My eyes are bloodshot, my wrists are sore and my back aches. But
I'm so entranced, I can't stop.
</P>
<P>
   My husband's car breaks down, and he has to walk three miles in
90-degree heat because he can't call home, the line is busy. I'm
making a buy.
</P>
<P>
   It started, like most habits do, with curiosity. One online
purchase certainly wouldn't be a gateway to sin. One hundred
personal checks later proves otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   I'm an eBay junkie _ addicted to an auction house in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Software engineer Pierre Omidyar had only the sweetest
intentions when he started eBay three years ago. He set up a
personal World Wide Web page as a forum for his girlfriend to trade
the Pez dispensers she collected.
</P>
<P>
   Now his simple page has morphed into a 2.25 million-item
inventory covering 1,627 categories with 3.8 million registered
users. The beauty of the system is that the company does not own
the inventory _ it belongs to the sellers who pay eBay a listing
fee and a percentage of the sales price to offer their goods
through the whiz-bang of computer land.
</P>
<P>
   The result is garage-sale heaven. Just a five-minute perusal of
the site clicks up 135 listings of Mexican pottery, 1,563 of
Depression glass, 3,858 dolls, 484 African-American art objects,
and, heaven help us, 8,572 Beanie Babies.
</P>
<P>
   A woman in Idaho is offering gently worn cowboy boots, a
Hawaiian seller is selling earrings made in India and a woman in
England is advertising toast forks. And you can see what you buy _
most of the listings include one or more color photographs of the
item, pointing out flaws or details.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't QVC, where you buy a cubic zirconium that you'll see
coming and going at Wal-Mart. No sir, these are genuine,
one-of-a-kind ``objets.''
</P>
<P>
   No more pawing through formula-stained Onesies, Dallas Cowboys
coozies and lidless crockpots to get to the Steuben vase. No more
Saturday mornings of crack-o'-dawn alarms to beat out the other
garage-salers. No more trying to juggle the children, the traffic
and the marked-up classifieds.
</P>
<P>
   And the eBay facilitators make the shopping as pleasant as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   The system is set up like any live auction. Items are offered in
categories, shoppers click on entries that catch the eye
``GENUINETURKISH VASEHAND PAINTED'' and look at the description as
well as the photograph.
</P>
<P>
   If you care to bid, look at the last bid, figure what you'd like
to pay, enter the amount and submit the bid. When the auction is
completed (most are scheduled to run five days) the high bidder is
notified by e-mail from eBay. Seller and buyer have three days to
get in touch by e-mail, and the buyer sends off a check or money
order, including the purchase price and usually, postage.
</P>
<P>
   Like a real-deal auction, there is technique to be learned. Most
heavy bidding seems to occur within an hour or two of the item's
close time. Sometimes the seller sets a reserve price, meaning it
won't sell unless a certain price is met.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   I blame my addiction _ as many people do _ on the stress of my
job. I was compiling information for a yearlong ``food through the
century'' project. I needed old recipes, old photographs, just
plain old stuff to help me get a handle on the way we've been
eating for the past 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   After tackling the local libraries and my own collection of
cookbooks, on the advice of a co-worker, I turned to eBay.
</P>
<P>
   My first purchase was Item 887792861: Jell-O Recipe Booklet _
Work of Art!!! 1925 (I was the high bidder at $6). I followed that
with Item 88541687: RECIPES The House of Chan Cookbook 1952 ($3).
Then came Item 88282989: 500 Delicious Salads (recipes) Cookbook
OLD ($2). This, I've gotta say, rocks.
</P>
<P>
   By now I was a regular. I knew my way around the site. (''It's
like crack,'' said one co-worker. ``Walk away and just say no.'')
Now I could peck around for things I used to buy at flea markets
before I had a house payment and a child and a college fund to
build.
</P>
<P>
   First I bought treasures for myself. Item 88911475: Gorgeous
Colors! _ Bakelite (?) Old Jewelry Box ($10.49). Then came Item
90691226: Old Dip Bowl w/ Recipes on Outside Gold Trim ($1.50). I
followed that with Jade/Jadite lamp No Reserve ($29.52).
</P>
<P>
   It got to the point that I was firing up the laptop as soon as I
walked in the house after work. Dinner was left to the boys to
perform. I had tchotchkes to track down. But a little guilt did
start to seep in around the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Item 96695543: SOAP ``MADE IN SPAIN'' (3) SEE PIC!!! ($4.99)
will send my mother-in-law over the moon come Christmas. She loves
Macedonia glycerin soap and hasn't been able to find it since a
trip to Europe 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Item 95919386: WOW 3 MINT HESS TRUCKS 1992/93/94 IN BOXES
($74.95) filled in the holes in my son's green-and-white truck
collection.
</P>
<P>
   But my sacrificial buys didn't help my case _ the phone became
an issue. My son's friends couldn't get through, my husband's
office couldn't reach him, my parents wondered whether Fort Worth
had been hit by another hailstorm.
</P>
<P>
   My husband insisted on a cable modem to free up the phone. Add
$30 a month to the household budget. My 6-year-old knew to tell a
playmate that a word processor ``doesn't get eBay.'' The household
schedule was being affected. Lots of the auctions end around 7-9
p.m. Pacific time _ two hours later here _ time I should be using
to get ready for the next day.
</P>
<P>
   But all will be forgiven. Wait until next week when the mailman
drives up with Item 111100650: Wooly Mammoth Skull with Ivory
Tusks.

<P>
   GETTING STARTED: THE EBAY ESSENTIALS
</P>
<P>
   Getting started on eBay is frighteningly simple.
</P>
<P>
   Type www.ebay.com to get the site. If you want to window-shop,
simply type your particular interest in the Search bar and press
Enter.
</P>
<P>
   For a full explanation of the site, go to the New User section
and click. If you want to bid, you'll have to go to the Register
area, also on the home page.
</P>
<P>
   To register, you must be at least 18 years old. The form will
ask for your e-mail address, your name and street address. A
primary phone number is also required. No credit card information
is required.
</P>
<P>
   If you wish, you can supply such information as your sex, age,
education and income level.
</P>
<P>
   Within 24 hours, eBay will e-mail you a confirmation code, and
you're ready to bid dot com.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Safety first
</P>
<P>
   A 13-year-old New Jersey boy had his Internet privileges yanked
after he racked up almost $3 million in eBay bids on a red 1955
Ford convertible, a van Gogh painting, an antique bed, a copy of a
Viking ship and a Superman comic book.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a stern ``You must be 18 years old'' reminder (in red)
on the top of the auction site's registration form, he went ahead
and registered. And bid, and bid, and bid.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Pursglove, eBay spokesman, said the company has a strict
policy against bidding by anyone younger than 18. But he said eBay
mostly works on the honor system; it's up to users to report
deadbeat bidders.
</P>
<P>
   The number of consumers complaining that they were defrauded
online went from 1,280 in 1997 to 7,752 in 1998, according to
Internet Fraud Watch, an online fraud reporting system created by
the National Consumers League.
</P>
<P>
   But as e-commerce mushrooms, the Internet companies are coming
up with options to protect the mostly honest shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   On eBay, there's payback if buyer or seller is less than honest
or prompt. The ``Feedback'' forum allows buyers and sellers to
leave messages about their transactions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company offers i-Escrow, a service that acts as
the third-party agent in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works. The buyer and seller agree on a price. The
buyer sends credit-card information (MasterCard, Visa, American
Express, Discover, Diners or Carte Blanche) or a check or money
order, to i-Escrow. Meanwhile the seller sends the item to the
buyers. When the buyer lets i-Escrow know the item has arrived and
is as advertised, i-Escrow forwards the money to the seller.

   This service costs the buyer 5 percent of the purchase price
(with a $5 minimum) for objects up to $5,000. Items priced at more
than $5,000 get a discount rate.

FCC SAYS IT SHOULD REGULATE HIGH-SPEED ACCESS TO INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anxious cable companies got a boost Tuesday when the chairman of
the Federal Communications Commission, William Kennard, said his
agency, not local governments, should regulate high-speed Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the FCC and Congress have declined to regulate cable
Internet services. Kennard, in a speech to the National Cable
Television Association in Chicago, was responding to a federal
court ruling in Portland, Ore., two weeks ago affirming the
authority of local governments to require AT&AMP;T Corp. to allow
competing Internet service providers onto the cable system it
acquired in its purchase of Telecommunications Inc. this year.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has said it will appeal the decision, but cable executives
want assurance that if they spend billions upgrading their cable
systems, they will be able to use their own high-speed Internet
access providers. AT&AMP;T is a majority owner of the cable-Internet
service Excite(at)Home, while Time Warner Inc. owns the Roadrunner
cable modem service.
</P>
<P>
   America Online and other Internet service providers are lobbying
the FCC and local governments to force the cable companies to open
their systems to them.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard said he was studying his options for getting involved in
the Portland case. Cheryl Leanza, deputy director of Media Access
Project, a nonprofit telecommunications law firm, said that
generally courts had tended to defer to the FCC in complex
regulatory matters.
</P>
<P>
   The Portland case was widely followed because it set a precedent
for how other local governments might behave.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have here is a power struggle that goes back to the
Civil War,'' said Howard Anderson, president of Yankee Group, a
consulting firm. ``It is a question of whether the federal
government or the state government will have control. For the cable
operators, it is not so much about money, as about power. What they
want to do is to exclude the other Internet providers.''
</P>
<P>
   News that the FCC might intervene in the matter sent stocks of
cable operators up Tuesday. Time Warner shares rose $4.625 to close
at $66.687, Comcast rose $1.93 to close at $32.875 and Adelphia
jumped $6.875 to close at $62.875.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner stock also benefited from its bid to focus attention
on its Internet-related business. Yesterday it named Richard
Bressler, who has been the company's chief financial officer since
1995, head of its new online unit, Time Warner Digital Media, which
includes all the company's Internet presence, including electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's chairman, Gerald Levin, described the new entity
as the company's ``single most important growth area.''

RELIGIOUS LEADERS EXPAND THEIR MINISTRIES TO THE INTERNET
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By TARA DOOLEY  
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ From the front bedroom of his Fort Worth
home, Brian Oakes can enter a Christian mission field.
</P>
<P>
   With the flip of a switch on his computer, Oakes can join a
gathering of about 300 Christians from a registration list of
15,000 to discuss everything from Jesus Christ to the latest trends
in Christian music to the politics of a church youth group.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't think this type of ministry is relevant,'' said
Oakes, 23, a self-described computer geek and founder of the
Christian Chat Network. ``But let's look at people's lives. What do
people do? They spend most of their time on the Internet. If the
church is not willing to embrace it, then the church is going to
get left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Though perhaps not a place where people spend ``most of their
time,'' the Internet has affected how many people do business, and
the business of religion is increasingly no exception. More
Christians are going online, changing the ways that spiritual
communities interact and discuss matters of the soul.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders are e-mailing congregation members, preachers are
broadcasting sermons, peddlers are selling their religious wares,
and individuals, such as those gathered by Oakes, are reaching out
to one another for solace and inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it is as significant a new medium as the printing
press was, and we know now what the printing press did,'' said Fran
Maier, chancellor of the Catholic Archdiocese of Denver, making
reference to the Protestant Reformation that was propelled by the
printed word. ``We want to be ahead of the curve rather than behind
it the next time.''
</P>
<P>
   As Christians strive to stay ahead of the curve, however, many
religious leaders are concerned that widespread Internet use could
erode the church's calling to bring people together, physically and
spiritually.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we try to say is, `If you use the Internet, you need to
use it as a tool to move people toward embodied relationships,'''
said Robert DeVargas, an assistant professor at Southwestern
Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, who is creating an
ethics and technology course on the Internet and ministry. ``That
means first in a relationship to God, to the church, and in a
relationship with friends and family.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, there appears little danger that disembodied multitudes
will forsake the pews for their computers, according to a 10-month
survey of religion online conducted for a division of the United
Methodist Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a lack of people saying, `Oh good, I don't
have to get up and get dressed and go to church. I can log onto the
Internet and go to church,' '' said the study's author, Ken Bedell,
vice president of the Forum Foundation in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Internet users, those using the technology for
religious matters log on to improve communications and find
information, according to the study, which was completed last year.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the movement toward the Internet is part of a
progression starting with radio and television that has led
religion away from the pulpit or the camp meeting ground and into
the home. But the difference now is that the Internet also allows
for more individual autonomy and privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not unique to the Internet but, because of the
interactive nature, it is more compelling to be disembodied,''
DeVargas said.
</P>
<P>
   The flip side is that it allows users the chance to attend an
online Bible discussion or hear a sermon that a child's soccer
practice or other commitments might have pre-empted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can sit down at your computer once the kids are in bed and
everyone is settled down ... and listen to it while you are paying
your bills,'' said Paula Golway, marketing manager for the
Dallas-based Lightsource.com, which provides Christian programming
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Lightsource.com, run by an advertising agency that specializes
in Christian ministries, funnels popular Christian radio programs
such as Focus on the Family onto the Internet and broadcasts
services from churches such as Preston Hollow Presbyterian Church
in Dallas onto the personal computer, making it available for
consumption at the user's discretion.
</P>
<P>
   The number of possible people accessing the programming has also
expanded. Since January 1997, Lightsource.com has had an exclusive
contract to provide Christian programming for Broadcast.com, which
was recently bought by Yahoo!. And that will provide an
evangelizing link to one of the busiest sites on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back when Christ walked the Earth, he did it via himself and
12 disciples,'' Golway said. ``Now we have a way of expanding it
around the world in milliseconds. It's a very interesting and very
hip way of doing what people have been doing for 2000 years.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, the possibility that the technology will not
only enhance but alter what people have been doing for 2000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Archdiocese of Denver sponsored a four-day
seminar examining how emerging technologies will affect the ways
faith is communicated in the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   It included computer industry professionals, theologians and
church leaders who looked at how to use technologies such as the
Internet to ``make disciples of all nations.'' But it also looked
at the social implications of the new technology, Maier said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology has to do with how we deliver the message,'' he
said. ``The psychological implications have to do with who it is
that we are reaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet use at Calvary Lutheran Church in Richland Hills is
probably most typical of how the technology is used by churches to
reach people.
</P>
<P>
   The church's leaders use e-mail to keep in touch with
denominational leaders and congregation members and to reach
potential newcomers. The church's Web site provides basic
information through its online newsletter and listings of weekly
services and events such as The Calvary Cafe, a weekly dinner
prepared by the Rev. Phil Heinze, the church's associate pastor.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, church members and Web site visitors can e-mail
prayer requests, read devotionals and join a discussion board where
topics range from a sick child in the community to a recent sermon.
</P>
<P>
   For example, by logging onto the Web site, congregation members
can keep up with the progress of 4-year-old Mason Renner, who has
leukemia, and send prayers for the child and his family.
</P>
<P>
   Though his use of the Web site has slowed since Mason's illness,
the child's father, Dan Renner, said he had participated in an
online discussion group that tackled topics such as Thomas the
Doubter and Lazarus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is somewhat different because people generally have to
gather their thoughts together instead of rambling on and on,''
Renner said. ``I think you get more concise thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   The church's Web site also provides links to online resources
such as the Internet Christian Library, a selection of Bibles and
Bible tutorials, and The Desperate Preacher,' a lectionary
discussion site for preachers preparing sermons.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have at Calvary is a Web site, and it's a reflection
of our real community at Calvary Lutheran Church,'' said Michael
Middleton, a computer professional and congregation member who
helped design the Web site. ``It's an invitation for people to join
us. It wouldn't exist if we didn't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Oakes' Christian Chat Network has produced
Christian relationships that exist because of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Oakes steers clear of calling those who enter the network's chat
rooms a community, he said, because he believes that term should be
reserved for gatherings in rooms with pews.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what term he uses, Oakes has created an Internet
assembly that allows Christians to discuss religious convictions
and secular concerns while offering a way to forge friendships.
</P>
<P>
   The user can enter the network by signing on with a self-chosen
name. The user enters a ``lobby'' and can stay there and talk for a
while or head into specialty sections for teen-agers, single adults
or women, Oakes said. Some users will schedule times to meet online
and chat.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, it is not the most outgoing person on the
computer,'' Oakes said. ``With the anonymity, that baggage can be
taken away.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakes also rebroadcasts a Christian music radio show online and
broadcasts a call-in show that he moderates over the network.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Lee, a divorced mother of four from Cedar Lake, Ind.,
found out about Oakes' network from a friend.
</P>
<P>
   In the confines of chat rooms protected by a filtering system
that will eject any user that contributes inappropriate material,
Lee said she has spent many evenings discussing spiritual issues
online and has made friends. She is now a monitor for two All
Singles Believers chat rooms on the network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of fun,'' she said. ``But some of it is serious.
Sometimes people come in and have a problem, and they want to talk
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Enhancing the virtual with the real, Lee has physically met and
made friends with chat network users in Michigan and Illinois, she
said. A group of the users is planning to gather in Florida in
August.
</P>
<P>
   Bedell found that the people he surveyed believe that the
Internet will likely play an even more important role in religious
life in the future.
</P>
<P>
   But how it will change and help shape spiritual matters is
unclear, said Bedell, a sociologist and ordained United Methodist
minister.
</P>
<P>
   The potential exists for meaningful theological discussion to
take place on the Internet, he said, especially because it is a
means of communication worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Viewing it simply as a tool for the local church may be to
underestimate its effects and potential, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real possibility that the future of spirituality
and religion will get worked out on the Internet,'' Bedell said.
</P>
<P>
   But even enthusiasts approach that era cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   Taking into account concerns about disembodied spiritual
communities, Oakes said he personally makes sure that he doesn't
become mesmerized by his computer screen and forsake the rest of
life.
</P>
<P>
   Oakes said he spends a chunk of most weekday evenings online,
but he also has a demanding job as a protocol engineer for a
computer company, a fiance and Kruger, his attention-hungry hound.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Chat Network operates through donations and the
fees Oakes collects for hosting Web sites, mostly for Christian
ministries and bands.
</P>
<P>
   Some months, it breaks even. Some months, Oakes uses part of his
paycheck from his regular job to pay the network's bills, which run
about $1,200 a month, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, the network is Oakes' contribution to Christian
ministry, his way to give something back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is truly the last open mission field,'' Oakes
said. ``I can get past the door into the bedroom and tell people
about Christ.''

Y2K CONSULTANT NO LONGER ALARMED ABOUT DATE CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN WECHSLER  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALTAMONT, N.Y. _ Barry Pardy went all out when he first heard of
the Y2K bug two years ago. The computer consultant and his wife
bought a year's worth of food _ long-term storage stuff like
unground wheat, powdered milk and food specially canned by Mormons.
</P>
<P>
   They bought a water purifier good for 13,000 gallons, and bleach
in case they needed to treat more. They installed heavy-duty locks
on their house to keep out rioters, put in a generator, and are now
looking for a wood burning stove. All in preparation for the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Pardy is still worried about the Year 2000 (Y2K) computer
glitch. But now, he's more realistic about its impact. Today, he
doubts he'll be touching his drums of wheat, although he doesn't
regret buying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still many unknowns,'' he said. ``But because so many
people are doing good work, I feel more optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Months after the millennium computer bug began to make news all
over the country, much has been done to fix the problem. Companies
are spending billions of dollars to reprogram computers or replace
them. Government offices have made citizens aware of how much work
they're doing to solve their problems. Banks say money is safe;
utilities say power will stay on after midnight on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   While some still think New Year's Eve will bring disaster, many
others _ even those who were once terrified of Y2K _ are beginning
to relax. Whatever computer problems the new year may bring, they
don't seem as bad as they did only a short time ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K bug, of course, refers to a computer's inability to
understand that next year is the 2000. When many date-sensitive
computers or their programs were built, only the last two digits of
the year were used. So some computers may read the ``00'' in 2000
as ``1900,'' causing them to crash or spew out incorrect data.
</P>
<P>
   When 1999 was three decades away, that didn't seem like a
problem _ especially since programmers thought their programs and
clattering equipment would eventually be replaced, long before the
turn of the century. Only, in most cases, it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Some programmers tried to warn others early, but most didn't
take Y2K seriously until the early 1990s. That was when major
government agencies like Social Security and the Department of
Defense began to do their own Y2K remediation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a few people began to look at the worst-case scenario
of what Y2K could do. They called it The End of the World As We
Know It, or TEOTWAWKI. And using the World Wide Web, people like
Gary North _ a historian, economist and Christian reconstructionist
who has written several books about the end of the world _ began to
preach the death of civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Word was that Y2K problems could cause planes to fall out of the
sky, could cause cars to stop working, could shut down pacemakers
and ATM machines and every other facet of modern civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Pardy, a consultant from Altamont who helps companies prepare
for Y2K, started researching the millennium bug 2 1/2 years ago. He
scrolled through Web sites and talked to experts, and began to
realize that a widespread computer failure would be disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I immediately thought about all of the computers I'd worked on
over the years,'' he said. ``And the time I'd seen businesses be
flat down because of one simple problem on the computer.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been evidence since then that the problems may have
been exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, some Y2K-related failures that were to have
happened _ so-called ``trigger dates'' _ were rather anticlimactic.
April 9, 1999 was supposed to have been a big bump in the road. The
concern was it might be seen by some computers as the code
``9999,'' which many programmers have used to signal a program to
end. But few problems were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the embedded chip problem. The concern was that
modern computer chips used in all sorts of machinery might include
a date-recognition code that could cause it to stop working. As it
turned out, problems of this sort are very rare.
</P>
<P>
   Many concerned about Y2K were most concerned about panic. Panic,
they say, is more likely than computer glitches to cause bank runs,
food hoarding and even riots.
</P>
<P>
   Today, while it's still a concern, it seems unlikely that people
could panic over something that's been discussed over and over
again for so long. Some people even say the media is paying too
much attention to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's happening is just about everybody's made up
their minds already,'' said Dick Mills, a computer consultant and
head of a Y2K interest group in upstate New York. ``Either they've
fixed the thing and they think they're ready, or they don't want to
do anything anymore.''

   Computer experts fear that computers and other electronic
equipment originally programmed to recognize only the last two
digits of a year will fail or malfunction on Jan. 1, 2000, when the
machines will assume it is 1900. This is known as the Year 2000
(Y2K) problem or the millennium bug.

MAC USERS HAVE FEWER WORRIES AS 2000 APPROACHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM M. DOWD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Forget the workplace equipment. Who among
individuals should worry about making sure their personal computers
and software are Y2K compliant?
</P>
<P>
   If you're a Macintosh user, rejoice. Macs are in sync with the
date change, although there can be software problems.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the date and time utilities that Apple Inc. has used in
its Macs since 1984 should work right up to 6:28:15 a.m. on Feb. 6,
2040 _ although it never hurts to have the latest version of
operating system software (now Mac OS 8.5) just to play it extra
safe.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else should be wary.
</P>
<P>
   The calendar progression from Dec. 31, 1999, to Jan. 1, 2000,
will create a double whammy for date-dependent programs.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will some not know the difference between 1900 and 2000
because they rely on reading only the two final digits of the year,
they'll be all bollixed up because of the day-of-the-week problem:
Jan. 1, 1900, was a Monday. Jan. 1, 2000, will be a Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In checking your vulnerability quotient, look at three basic
areas to see if your equipment and software (particularly
date-reliant programs such as accounting and spreadsheet programs)
can display a four-digit year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hardware: More than 90 percent of PCs with a basic input-out
system (BIOS) built before 1996 are not Y2K compliant. That
non-compliance drops to only about 10 percent of those built from
1998 to now. To find out if yours is a bad one, match your PC's
model number and BIOS version (as listed in your owner's setup
manual) with the Y2K compliance list the manufacturer will have on
its Web site. You should be able to obtain BIOS upgrades from the
PC maker.
</P>
<P>
   You can get free utilities for checking your PC from
http://inflorida.net/y2k/download.htm, a good Web page with plenty
of site names and direct links.
</P>
<P>
   _ Software: Y2K compliance can be a problem with both Macintosh
and PCs. In a massive effort to keep from alienating the market,
most major software companies already have issued upgrades or
patches to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest problems, however, may be with freeware or
shareware. Those, for the most part, are programs created by
independent programmers and distributed for free or at minimal
charge over the Internet. They are so varied it's a virtual
certainty many of them will go haywire. But for mainstream
``store-bought'' programs, contact the software company for
compliance information if you haven't yet seen a fix being issued.
</P>
<P>
   _ Operating Systems: The Mac systems are OK. Microsoft has a
variety of operating systems: MS-DOS, Windows 3.x, Windows 95,
Windows 98, Windows NT. Compliance varies.
</P>
<P>
   Win 3.x and Win 95 require fixes or patches. Users of MS-DOS
will have to set the systems for a four-digit year display. How you
do it will vary from one PC manufacturer to another; some will let
you access it through ``tools,'' some through ``date and time'' in
the control panel _ check your user's manual. (When you do that,
the date may look garbled for Windows 3.1, 3.1.1 or 95 users.
That's only cosmetic; you can download a patch from the Microsoft
Web site to fix it.)
</P>
<P>
   Even if you have Win 98, there could be a problem. Microsoft has
already released a patch for it because of a garble problem that
may not affect data but can make some operations confusing. You can
download a patch from the Web site
(http://www.microsoft.com/ms.htm) or order a free CD (with a 4- to
6-week wait) by calling 800-363-2896.

HIKING THE ADIRONDACKS, PEAK BY PEAK 
</HEADLINE>

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN WECHSLER  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ADIRONDACKS PARK, N.Y. _ Few hikers ever attempt Blue Ridge in
the Central Adirondacks, a 3,820-foot mound that requires a
bushwhack of several miles. After ducking under fallen trees,
crossing a muddy marsh and then climbing 500 feet of steep woods,
hikers find slim reward: a stand of trees so thick as to almost
obscure the sky.
</P>
<P>
   But on a recent sunny Sunday, Al Peters, his wife Joan and their
friend Walt Hayes set out on the 8-mile journey. The reason: Blue
Ridge is number 56 of the 100 highest peaks in the Adirondacks, and
the three are trying to climb them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really do it for sense of accomplishment,'' Peters, who is
from Charlton, said before starting out. ``There's almost never any
reward, in terms of a view.''
</P>
<P>
   For an increasing number of people, just heading into the woods
isn't enough. Better, it seems, to have a list to complete,
something to tick off after a hard day's journey.
</P>
<P>
   What began in the 1920s with the 46ers _ people who have climbed
the 46 High Peaks of the Adirondacks, all over 4,000 feet in
elevation _ has expanded around the Adirondacks, New York, New
England and, depending on climbers' skills, the world. (Several of
the peaks have been determined to actually be below 4,000 feet, but
remain on the list for historical reasons.)
</P>
<P>
   In the Adirondacks, beyond the 46ers, there are the winter
46ers, those who have climbed the 100 highest and the fire tower
peaks _ mountains that have or at one time had fire towers on the
summit. One group is climbing every peak surveyed by Verplanck
Colvin, who measured the height of hundreds of mountains in the
late 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   Some put their own spin on hiking, like the man who is currently
doing the 46 barefoot. Others are legendary. Fred Hunt, a retired
college professor now living in Vermont, has climbed all 46 peaks
at night, and, in the early 1970s, during every month of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a way to keep me from going mad when the four walls
began to close in on me,'' said Hunt, now 75, who was known as
``Cat Eyes'' and ``Moonlight Mountaineer.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's John E. Winkler, who bushwhacked up all 46 peaks
from the late 1970s to the early '80s after climbing them on the
normal routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kinda complicated,'' said Winkler, author of two books
about the Adirondacks. ``But it was a good thing. As far as I know,
I'm the only person who's ever done it.''
</P>
<P>
   This nature-by-numbers approach has some hikers shaking their
heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hike for lists,'' said 67-year-old Barbara McMartin,
author of the 11-book ``Discover the Adirondacks'' series, who
purposely never became a 46er because some of the mountains have no
views.
</P>
<P>
   The ever-increasing popularity of such lists as the 46 worries
some. The number of those who have climbed the High Peaks 46 has
nearly doubled in 10 years, from 2,582 in 1988 to 4,447 in 1992,
according to the Adirondack 46ers, hikers who volunteer to keep
track of such things. And the number of hikers who visited the area
doubled as well in that time, to 140,000.
</P>
<P>
   So many hikers flock to the 46 that the state last month adopted
new rules for the area.
</P>
<P>
   The High Peaks Unit Management Plan limits group size and the
number of cars parked at various trailheads. It also approves, for
the first time, the marking of routes up ``trailless peaks.'' Such
peaks had numerous ``herd'' paths carved by hikers trying to find
the best route to the top. Beginning this summer, volunteers will
flag the correct route and block off false paths to keep erosion to
a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question in my mind the idea of climbing all 46
peaks is motivation for some people to climb mountains,'' said Stu
Buchanan, director of Region 5 of the New York Department of
Environmental Conservation. ``Our hope is to get some control on
visitor use in the High Peaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter the relatively new lists, like the Adirondacks 100.
Meeting that goal is a reason for hikers to get away from the High
Peaks, and visit mountains few have even heard of. And that's a
good thing, some say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 46 are just too popular,'' said Jack Freeman, an avid
hiker and spokesman for the Adirondack Mountain Club. ``There are a
lot of unused areas, outside the High Peaks. We wish people would
really explore and discover these nice, wild areas.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Adirondacks were at first ignored by New York state and then
exploited for its timber and iron ore in the late 1800s. In the
tail end of that century, the peaks were first climbed by surveyors
and mountain guides taking rich tourists on hikes into the
backcountry.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until the 1920s that hikers thought of completing the
challenge of summiting all 46 peaks.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1930s, members of a church organized the first group
dedicated to climbing the 46. A few years later, the club ``Troy
46ers'' was born. By the end of World War II, more than 40 people
had completed the 46.
</P>
<P>
   Trails have improved much since those days, as has technology
useful for bushwhacking.
</P>
<P>
   The Peters and Hayes, who is from Glenville, never head off
trail without taking a satellite-based Global Positioning System
unit with them. Using the cellular-phone-sized piece of equipment
and a topographic map, bushwhackers can find their position
anywhere on the globe, down to a few hundred feet.
</P>
<P>
   While GPS has made it easier for hikers to find their way to the
right peak, hiking off-the-beaten-track mountains like the
trailless Adirondack 100 will always be an adventure. Al Peters
discovered that firsthand last fall, when he took a tumble two
miles from the road and dislocated his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Five hours after starting out, Hayes, Peters and his wife
reached the flat summit of Blue Ridge. With some difficulty, they
found a summit marker, a plastic peanut-butter jar left in 1992.
Inside was a tiny log, which included the names of fewer than 10
visitors who have arrived since then.
</P>
<P>
   On the peak, the trees were so thick that when the three walked
a few yards to the side of the mountain to search for a view, it
took them 10 minutes to retrace their steps to the top. Mosquitoes
and several types of biting flies swarmed by the hundreds, landing
on backpacks and the hikers' hair. Peters and his wife quickly
donned headnets. Hayes just brushed them away.
</P>
<P>
   Peters and his wife have 21 peaks left to do. Hayes has 22, and
he's already planning what he'll do next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to keep climbing,'' he said. ``I've got a list of
150 more peaks I'd like to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters is more pragmatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``After this,'' he said, ``we're gonna do fun things.''

GAY FILM FESTIVAL OPENS IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There's a host of things scheduled to happen
during the 10 days of the 23rd Lesbian and Gay Film Festival, which
runs June 17-27 at the Castro, the Roxie and the Victoria theaters
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Breakups. Breakdowns. Break-ins. Breakthroughs. Cloudbreak,
heartbreak, broken skin, broken records, broken bones. But only one
image breaks like the dawn.
</P>
<P>
   It's a smile _ one of the truest, most sincere expressions of
joy you'll ever see _ and it belongs to Christian Campbell who
stars in ``trick,'' Jim Fall's opening-night feature, Thursday at
the Castro. It's a great way to jump-start a festival, particularly
one accentuating the positive, exhilarating aspects of an
international lesbian-gay cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Fall's debut is a wholly conventional boy-meets boy,
boy-looks-for-place-to-shag-boy love story with an assortment of
robust caricatures trying to abet and deter Campbell's love-struck
showtune composer from getting it on with a go-go stripper (John
Paul Pitoc), including an interestingly human Tori Spelling who
wanders out of self-parody and into a performance as Campbell's
self-obsessed pal. But alas it's that blazing smile that could make
the sun jealous and captures the contagious ecstasy of a
reciprocated crush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trick'' is but one of an overwhelming number of films feasting
on gays, lesbians and bisexuals way below a certain age.
</P>
<P>
   Sweden's sophisticated, excited ``Show Me Love'' (June 27,
Castro), which closes the festival, takes its title from Nordic
soulthang Robyn's demand that she be shown ``what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   That's precisely what high-schooler Agnes (Rebecca Liljeberg)
does for punky, prissy fellow pupil Elin (Alexandra Dahlstrom), who
equates being a lesbian with choosing a major. The film has that
shot-on-Hi-8, Dogma '95 look that a handful of Danish filmmakers
are crazy about that says you-are-there, and when the girls have
their sweet first kiss to a Foreigner tune you're kinda glad you
were there _ to chaperon, of course.
</P>
<P>
   In the nine days between opening and closing night, young gay
hormones are raging in films like the Canadian ``Better Than
Chocolate'' (Friday, Castro) and Spain's ``Don't Tell Anyone''
(June 26, Castro) with the reckless facility of their straight
teen-age peers.
</P>
<P>
   You know being young and gay (or at least ``bi'') has gotten
out-of-control hot when none other than Jonathan ``JTT'' Taylor
Thomas makes a few home improvements of his own when he dims his
sunshine act to play a hustler in the occasionally surging
``Speedway Junky'' (June 22, Castro). But in this comprehensive,
masterfully programmed festival, nearly every sexual experience is
substantially represented, and there are plenty of offerings from
filmmakers of color.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to rally around the festival's youth bent, perhaps
because it signals some gradual normalization or acceptance that
begins between classes in high school. Still, there's an impressive
array of films either about or featuring a wiser, less
reckless-and-charged perspective (if not in age, then in
experience) _ from ``Living With Pride'' (June 25, Victoria), about
centenarian activist Ruth C. Ellis, to the poignant double bill of
``Golden Threads'' and ``I Know a Place'' (Sunday, Victoria).
</P>
<P>
   All three films, plus several others _ including the torpid,
inert ``Beloved/ Friend'' from Spain _ assert a more vital place in
the lesbian-gay spectrum than condescending ``twilight-years''
retrospection.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous films in the festival line-up handle sexuality with
care, just as others simply revel in sensation. But AIDS is rarely,
if ever, used as a narrative subject or a plot point.
</P>
<P>
   While none of the features or the programmed shorts would
purport to be post-AIDS or HIV, taken as a whole they also manage
to take homosexuality into more fantastic, experimental,
transcendent realms that refuse to give in to the disease and would
rather be spooked by more cinematic (or literary) ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   But when sex isn't enough, or when it gets old _ as it
intermittently does throughout the non-stop,
must-be-seen-to-be-believed British soap party ``Queer as Folk''
(June 21-24, Victoria), for example _ there's love. The plausible
kind.
</P>
<P>
   Nisha Gantara's dismally titled, wonderful to watch ``Chutney
Popcorn'' (June 25, Castro), about a New Yorker who upsets her
girlfriend by agreeing to have her infertile sister's baby, has a
likable ease _ while entertaining the suspicion that love may be as
temporarily beautiful as the henna tattoos its conflicted Indian
paints on anonymous bodies. It also touches on the dilemma of being
an Indian lesbian with a white girlfriend and stubborn mom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Popcorn'' highlights the upside of establishing an indie-rock,
sitcommish rapport between characters and contains some of the
freshest throwaway retorts you'll hear. (``Oh please. That
bi-phobia thing is so '95!'')
</P>
<P>
   Gantara also offers the comic realization that the border
distinguishing heterosexual values and relationship traits from
homosexual ones has begun to erode as if the difference had been a
construct all along. That suspicion is expressed in a surprising
number of films that don't warp genders so much as they question
the very idea of a single orientation.
</P>
<P>
   If Monica Treut's film ``Gendernauts'' (Sunday, Castro) looks
into the elimination of gender, then Rose Troche's quizzical, funny
``Bedrooms and Hallways'' (Saturday, Castro), manages to make a
quiet farce of the malleability of sexual orientation when love is
the drug and not the libido.
</P>
<P>
   For non-white members of the gay community, finding any visual
representation is a challenge that not even the progressiveness of
a grown-up gay cinema has done much to enhance.
</P>
<P>
   A series of panels and programs will seek to address those
concerns while bellowing a heartfelt shout-out to the late Marlon
Riggs _ whose ``Tongues Untied'' (Sunday, Castro) turns 10 years
old _ and bestowing the Frameline Award for ``outstanding
achievement in lesbian and gay media arts'' (Sunday, Castro).

 &HT;    Game for something good? Try low-fat meats
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Game tastes good, hasn't been commercially available in 100
years and is nutritionally impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Cookbook author Janie Hibler says these reasons are driving a
resurgence in game cooking that is bringing game into supermarkets
and has helped sell 20,000 copies of her James Beard Award-winning
book ``Wild About Game'' (Broadway, $30).
</P>
<P>
   While promoting the book, Hibler said she found two kinds of
game eaters: Those who grew up eating wild game and now prefer its
stronger taste; and people just being introduced to game, who
should start with the milder taste of farm-raised meat from New
Zealand or America.
</P>
<P>
   Besides taste, the main difference between domestic meats and
game is fat content.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fat in domestic meat is marbled and in game it's around
the muscle. That's why, when you buy game, you won't see any fat or
if you do it's only on the outside,'' Hibler said.
</P>
<P>
   That means game cooks quickly.
</P>
<P>
   And even though their nutritional profiles may beat those of
traditional red meats, bison, venison and ostrich are treated like
any other lean red meats by the American Heart Association. It
recommends adults should eat no more than three 3-ounce cooked
portions a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red meat is a healthy part of an adult's diet, and it should
be the complementary part of the meal, not the main part,'' says
Leslie Stewart, nutrition educator for the Fuqua Heart Center at
Piedmont Hospital and spokeswoman for the AHA.
</P>
<P>
   What game meats offer is a healthy alternative _ a way to stick
with red meats while shaking up menus in restaurants and at home.
</P>
<P>
   So if you're game for cooking game, try one of the recipes below
from local chefs who created them with you in mind.

<P>
   It's rich _ not gamey _ lean and sturdy, best served pink in the
middle. Canadian Vern Jackson, who once organized a traveling bison
barbecue, is quoted in the book ``Barbecue America'' as saying
bison tastes like beef wishes it did.
</P>
<P>
   If you can cook beef, you can cook bison, insists Richard
Lindamood, chef at Buckhead Beef.
</P>
<P>
   To enjoy bison for the first time, keep it simple and don't
overcook it. This meat is often so lean it will dry out easily if
cooked too long. A bison steak the same size as a beef steak will
cook far more quickly, because the additional fat in the beef acts
as insulation. Because bison is denser, it will fill you up more
quickly, too.
</P>
<P>
   The National Bison Association recommends these grilling or
broiling ideas for steaks and ground bison:
</P>
<P>
   Grilled bison steak: Rub a 6-ounce cut (1 inch thick) with a bit
of garlic salt, cooking oil and lemon pepper. Grill 4 to 6 inches
above medium-hot coals 6 to 8 minutes for rare or 8 to 10 minutes
for medium.
</P>
<P>
   Bison burger: To make 4, shape 1 pound of lean ground bison into
four 1/2-inch-thick patties. Grill, covered, 4 to 6 inches above
medium-hot coals, turning once. (U.S. Bison recommends cooking to
160 degrees, the same temperature recommended for beef, but
recognizes that may be too well-done.) Season with salt and pepper
to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Bison franks: Hot dogs, just like those served at Turner Field,
will soon be available at Publix markets in the Atlanta area. Grill
as you would any hot dog _ until heated through.
</P>
<P>
   VENISON FACTS
</P>
<P>
   The USDA recommends cooking to 160 degrees, but recognizes
``tenderness issues'' and says cuts like racks, steaks, chops and
roasts may be cooked to 145 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Several cuts of fresh venison are available at Harry's Farmers
Market in Alpharetta, Whole Foods Market, Harris Teeter and other
well-stocked supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   OSTRICH FACTS
</P>
<P>
   Ostrich meat is so low in fat (see chart), it's becoming popular
for athletes in training and fitness enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   Because all the meat comes from thigh muscles, some cuts don't
look like traditional red meat cuts. For that reason, you should
always buy from a reliable source.
</P>
<P>
   The only trick is remembering that they are very lean and should
cook very quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Ostrich, fresh or frozen, is available in many major
supermarkets including Harris Teeter, Harry's Farmers Markets and
Whole Foods. For more information, contact the American Ostrich
Association, 817-232-1200. E-mail aoa(at)flash.net; ask for meat
suppliers' list or restaurant and market list.
</P>
<P>
   GENERAL INFORMATION
</P>
<P>
   For any particular cut, it's best to call your market first to
see if it's in stock. If not, many will order for you from Buckhead
Beef for delivery the next business day. Or search the Web. Most
kinds and cuts of game are available fresh with one- or two-day
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Mail delivery is available from Broadleaf Venison,
1-800-336-3844, Ext. 101; D'Artagnan, www.dartagnan.com; and

   MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   Ostrich Panang
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings Preparation time: 10 minutes Cooking time: 30
minutes
</P>
<P>
   Served with a pot of rice, this recipe from Thai Chili chef
Robert Khankiew makes a full meal. If you can't get fresh ostrich
steaks, you can use frozen filets. Remember to cook quickly and
slice thinly.
</P>
<P>
   1 pound ostrich steaks, cut in 4-ounce portions
</P>
<P>
   14 ounces coconut milk
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons panang curry paste
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons fish sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 tablespoons granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons finely chopped Kaffir lime leaves
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup roughly chopped sweet basil leaves
</P>
<P>
   Grill ostrich steaks over medium-high heat until medium-rare.
Slice meat thinly, as with London broil, and serve on top of sauce.
Garnish with basil leaves.
</P>
<P>
   To make the sauce: Heat a saucepan or wok over high heat until
it is nearly smoking. Dip the solidified coconut milk off the top
of the can and toss in skillet, stirring constantly. Add the panang
curry paste, and continue stirring to combine. Reduce heat to
medium, and cook about 5 minutes. Slowly add the remainder of the
coconut milk; then the fish sauce and sugar. Stir well. Cook until
sauce thickens, about 10 to 15 minutes; add the Kaffir lime leaves
and cook 2 to 3 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings, adding salt,
sugar, fish sauce or curry paste to taste (more curry paste will
make it spicier).
</P>
<P>
   When you're ready to serve, toss basil leaves into sauce, remove
from heat and stir.

   Mustard Seed Grilled Bison Filet
</P>
<P>
   With Mango-Orange Vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings Preparation time: 20 minutes Cooking time: 15
minutes Also a consultant for U.S. Bison, Kevin Rathbun developed
this easy recipe for backyard grilling. Try to save as much of the
seeded rub as possible from falling through the grill _ it adds a
crunchy bite to the tender filet. For more heat, add extra jalapeno
pepper to the rub. It will be well-balanced by the sweet-sour
Mango-Orange Vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   4 (6-ounce) bison filets
</P>
<P>
   For the mustard rub:
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons yellow mustard seeds
</P>
<P>
   3 teaspoons whole coriander seeds, cracked
</P>
<P>
   3 teaspoons dried cumin powder
</P>
<P>
   3 teaspoons paprika, ground
</P>
<P>
   3 teaspoons dried thyme
</P>
<P>
   3 teaspoons ginger powder
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons coarse salt
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons fresh garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 jalapeno, seeded and minced
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
</P>
<P>
   For the vinegar:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup fresh mango, peeled and chunked
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup distilled vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup fresh squeezed orange juice
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon coarse salt
</P>
<P>
   Cut bison into portions and reserve.
</P>
<P>
   For the mustard rub: Place all ingredients in a food processor.
Pulse until well-macerated but not completely smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Coat bison medallions generously with spice mixture and let
marinate in refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours until ready to grill. (Do
not marinate too long, as the salt in the rub will draw out too
much moisture.)
</P>
<P>
   Prepare grill to medium heat. Grill bison to desired
temperature, preferably medium-rare or 145 degrees. This will take
5 to 7 minutes per side, depending on thickness of the filets.
</P>
<P>
   For the Mango-Orange Vinegar: Place all ingredients in a small
pot over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Transfer to a
blender and blend until smooth. Serve 2 tablespoons sauce with each
portion of steak.

   Horseradish Bison Burger
</P>
<P>
   With Black Pepper Boursin Cheese
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings Preparation time: 10 minutes Cooking time:
about 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's best to add fat to lean game, but Kevin Rathbun
adds only an egg as a binder here. If you overcook this burger, it
will crumble. After three attempts, our best advice is to measure
carefully, take extra care to turn them only once on the grill and
remove them when medium-rare. If you want them cooked further for
those who like their burgers brown, try heating for a minute in the
microwave. It worked for us.
</P>
<P>
   For the burgers:
</P>
<P>
   24 ounces ground bison
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons prepared horseradish
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons ketchup
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon green Tabasco
</P>
<P>
   1 small egg
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons coarse salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   For assembly:
</P>
<P>
   4 sourdough buns
</P>
<P>
   1 red onion, sliced thin
</P>
<P>
   1 tomato, sliced thin
</P>
<P>
   1 package black pepper boursin cheese (see note)
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl, mix bison, horseradish, ketchup, garlic, green
Tabasco, egg, salt and pepper. Separate into 4 equal portions of 6
ounces each. Lightly oil burgers to prevent sticking on grill. Heat
grill to medium-hot. Grill bison burgers on both sides to desired
temperature, medium-rare or medium. This will take 5 to 6 minutes
per side. Warm boursin cheese in microwave or place on top of
burgers for 1 minute or until warm. Serve on buns with onion and
tomato.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Boursin cheese is available in supermarkets with
well-stocked cheese departments. If you have trouble finding it, a
good substitute is Alouette with garlic and herbs.

   Richard Lindamood, chef at Buckhead Beef, offers this recipe for
beginning game cooks. He says if you can cook a rack of lamb, you
can cook a rack of venison. Don't let the long list of ingredients
put you off _ it's worth every step.
</P>
<P>
   1 venison rack (8 bones, about 3 1/2 pounds)
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Preheat grill to high and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Open the
Cervena rack package and let rest 10 minutes. With a very sharp
knife, remove silverskin from meat. Mix pepper, coriander, chili
powder, cumin, cayenne, salt and thyme in a small bowl. Heat grill
to high, rub rack with olive oil and coat with seasoning mix. Cover
bones with aluminum foil. On hot grill, sear meat well on all
sides.
</P>
<P>
   Remove rack from grill and place in roasting pan in oven for 15

 &HT;    Will home cooks sink teeth into ostrich, bison and venison?
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Listen.
</P>
<P>
   That rumble is a herd gathering from the far reaches of Montana
and Utah, New Zealand and Arkansas, and it's headed straight for
your supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Fitted with marketing campaigns touting their hearty red-meat
taste yet remarkably low fat content, once exotic-sounding products
like bison, ostrich and venison are poised to stake a substantial
claim on the American dinner plate.
</P>
<P>
   Farm-raised to tame their wild reputations, these game meats
already have won the hearts of restaurant chefs _ from the top of
the Atlanta Hilton at ultra-plush Nikolai's Roof, where ostrich is
cooked with dried dates and served alongside yucca root puree and
poached leeks, to the ground floor of CNN Center, where at sports
bar Jocks &AMP; Jills you can opt for bison burgers instead of chicken
wings with your beer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the time has come to see whether home cooks will bite. And
just in time for Father's Day _ providing a healthier way for Dad
to have his steak and eat it, too.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the fledgling company U.S. Bison enters the big leagues
as 64 area Publix supermarkets begin selling its fresh ground
bison. And bison franks, the kind previously available only by
special order or on a game day at Turner Field, will appear in the
next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Bison products from other suppliers are available sporadically,
but this is a first on such a scale. The company Ted Turner founded
in 1997, that's headed by son R.E. ``Teddy'' Turner IV, moves into
the supermarket arena with products from North American Bison
Cooperative, with access to the senior Turner's 15,000 bison and
the herds of other members.
</P>
<P>
   Many Braves fans have already sampled a bison frank at a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become a very popular item and draws a lot of
attention,'' Braves vice president and director of marketing and
broadcasting Wayne Long said.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Atlanta, U.S. Bison also has signed the services of
well-known Atlanta chef Kevin Rathbun of Nava to develop recipes
and offer culinary advice to chefs and home cooks on using the
unfamiliar products.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just bison closing in _ there's venison and
ostrich, too, each offering a different taste of red meat, all with
fewer calories, far less fat and, often, less cholesterol and more
nutrients than beef. They may still sound exotic _ but then, so did
kiwi fruit a couple of decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wonderful that health-conscious Americans are
being encouraged to raise these leaner meats and give us more
options,'' says Kathleen Zelman, Marietta dietitian and spokeswoman
for the American Dietetic Association.
</P>
<P>
   The nutritional numbers sound too good to be true: A 4-ounce
serving of ostrich, for example, has 112 calories and 1 gram of
fat; the same size serving of bison has 124 calories and 2 grams of
fat. Compare that to a similar beef tenderloin serving, which
weighs in with 179 calories and 8 1/2 grams of fat.
</P>
<P>
   Healthy numbers, though, may not be enough to convince us to
shell out $15 or more for a 1-pound package. It has to taste good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled to see it become more readily available to the
public. The fact that it's also incredibly delicious, that's what's
exciting,'' says Janie Hibler, author of ``Wild About Game''
(Broadway, $30), a James Beard single-subject award winner
published in October that has already sold 20,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   But folks want to know what it tastes like before they attempt
to cook it, says Kirk Halpern, chief operating officer at Buckhead
Beef, which supplies game in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   And restaurants aren't the only ones offering a sample. Even the
World Wrestling Federation has jumped in, signing its name over to
a new ostrich meat snack stick to be available to a mass market in
August.
</P>
<P>
   After restaurant introduction, the usual route is to magazine
stories, Halpern said. That, too, is happening. The December issue
of Saveur included a major story on venison, the April edition of
Cucina Italiana featured ostrich, and bison recipes roam the pages
of the current Food &AMP; Wine.
</P>
<P>
   If the marketing doesn't fizzle, as it did with buffalo a decade
ago, ``somewhere in the next few years these three will be
everywhere in retail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So what does it taste like? Well, for once, not chicken. Even
ostrich _ the only bird in the group _ is considered a red meat.
Ostrich Panang is the current ``healthy alternative'' chef Robert
Khankiew rotates on his menu every few months at Thai Chili. It has
all the substance and even the look of London broil served with a
highly spiced curry sauce.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like it very much,'' Khankiew said, adding he sells at
least 10 orders a day.
</P>
<P>
   Because it's a bird, ostrich is the most often misunderstood of
the lot. The meat comes from the animal's thigh area, and cuts do
not correspond to either poultry or livestock cuts. That makes it
the most difficult of the three for home cooks to buy and prepare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may seem the most intimidating because it seems so
foreign,'' Hibler said. There are simple cooking techniques, she
added, that can be applied for all game:
</P>
<P>
   ``Either cook it hot and fast or slow and low. The way you know
which is the most tender meat _ farthest away from the antlers and
hooves like the backstrap or chops or steaks _ would be hot and
fast like grilling or sauteeing; and the tougher cuts _ the
shoulder, neck and shank _ need slow and low braising and
stewing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ostrich, except when ground, falls into the hot and fast
category, she said. It contains so little fat, which acts as an
insulator, that cooking time is reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Even chefs who know something about the product still sometimes
have a hard time finding what they need, but suppliers are picking
up on the weak spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to visit purveyors and taste new things,'' Louis Spost,
executive chef for the Atlanta Hilton, said. Last week he attended
a show on international food concepts and found a supplier offering
to sell just an ostrich cut called the fan, one that many chefs
agree is the most tender. ``A lot of times you have to buy a pack
with different cuts, and a lot of chefs don't like that,'' Spost
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bison and venison will be more familiar to home cooks, though,
because a bison filet looks like a beef filet and a strip steak is
a strip steak. ``Anyone who's cooked a rack of lamb can cook a rack
of venison,'' insists Richard Lindamood, chef at Buckhead Beef,
which sells fresh Cervena venison from New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   The big secret? Don't overcook.
</P>
<P>
   After working with bison, venison and other game, Spost has
altered his technique.

   ``Years ago most chefs were taught to sear meats at high
temperatures until they were crusted on the outside. Now chefs are
learning to cook slower, so it's not so rare in the middle like a
bull's eye,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For him, and most chefs, optimum is medium-rare.
</P>
<P>
   The USDA Meat &AMP; Poultry Hotline recommends cooking ostrich
roasts, steaks and chops to at least an internal temperature of 145
for medium-rare. For venison and bison, the official recommendation
is to cook to at least 160 degrees. Even so, Bessie Berry with the
hotline office said there are some ``tenderness issues'' with large
cuts and in those cases 145 degrees is acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Still other chefs prefer leaving the red meats redder but will
honor diners' preferences, Spost said.
</P>
<P>
   Buckhead Beef's Halpern points out that the safety concerns with
rare steak are minimal. ``Bacteria is on the outside, so when you
throw that steak on the grill, that temperature will kill the
bacteria. Where you run into problems is with ground products.''
</P>
<P>
   Hansell Roddenberry, president and CEO at U.S. Bison, has
quickly become the Bisonic Man _ eagerly working with chefs until
he is satisfied the product is being handled safely and can be
offered medium-rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've found the product basically speaks for itself, but with
it being as lean as it is, it requires proper preparation. In other
words, it really does not need to be overcooked,'' Roddenberry
stresses.
</P>
<P>
   Could Bisonburger Helper be in our future?

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Both Betty Marion and Kevin Owens e-mailed this easy
icebox pie in response to Sally Angevine's request for something
like lemon and chocolate icebox pies served at the former Char
House in Sandy Springs (Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   The day her request was published, Angevine called to say that a
man whose family had owned the restaurant called her to say that
while he wouldn't divulge any recipes, he would make her a pie.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if anybody sends in a recipe, I would love for you to
publish it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This pie, which can be chilled several hours or frozen, is
undoubtedly not like the restaurant's. But it is quick, easy and
satisfying _ if you're a fan of whipped topping.

 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Producing opera is a notoriously expensive
undertaking. The biggest budget item, especially for smaller
companies, is hiring union orchestra musicians for rehearsals and
performances. Many fledgling companies have been sunk by the
expense.
</P>
<P>
   This nearly was the fate of Operaworks, a small but determined
company founded in 1983 by David Leighton, a conductor and coach
who began his career in the 1970s as an assistant chorus master and
assistant conductor at the Metropolitan Opera.
</P>
<P>
   But for the last 10 years, while other companies have been
struggling to raise money to pay musicians, Operaworks has been
bypassing the cost with a controversial technological alternative,
the ``virtual orchestra,'' as the company's publicity materials
call it: in effect, a computer-realized electronic substitute.
</P>
<P>
   An artistic travesty? No doubt many opera fans and critics will
be appalled by the very idea of a virtual orchestra and dismayed by
its oddly processed sound. But Leighton, 48, says that his little
company is blazing a path to the techno-musical future and that
other smaller companies will soon be following suit.
</P>
<P>
   And although Operaworks is making scant money, the company
manages to present 8 to 12 staged productions a year, often of
unusual repertory, for modest-sized but seemingly loyal audiences.
The curious can hear for themselves when the company concludes its
current Strauss festival with a performance of ``Ariadne auf
Naxos'' on Friday night at the West-Park church on Amsterdam Avenue
and 86th Street.
</P>
<P>
   So how does the virtual orchestra work? And more important, how
does it sound? To find out, I attended a recent Operaworks
performance of ``Salome'' and afterward visited with J. Patrick
Casey, the company's general factotum, who directs the productions,
designs the sets, sometimes translates librettos into English, and
programs and runs the virtual orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   During performances Leighton stands before the stage to conduct
the singers. There is no orchestra pit at West-Park church; that
does not matter, since the company uses no orchestra. The virtual
equivalent is in the rear balcony where Casey mans a computer,
following the performance by watching Leighton. But the real work
has been done already.
</P>
<P>
   The actual sounds of the instruments are taken from a series of
CD-ROMs _ samplers, as they are called. One CD will contain nothing
but, say, the digitally recorded sounds of a clarinetist playing
long, sustained expression-neutral pitches, right up the chromatic
scale. These disks cost about $300 to $400 each, though more
expensive ones are available.
</P>
<P>
   A standard $4,000 sequencer, a mixer with 16 tracks, and of
course the computer are the essential components of the orchestral
music. Basically, Casey enters every single note, every line of the
complex Strauss score into the computer by playing it on a silent
keyboard which borrows sounds from the sampler CDs. So, for
example, the slinky, insinuating solo clarinet line that ``Salome''
begins with is performed by Casey at the keyboard with the desired
tempo, dynamics, articulations and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a bank of about 30 sounds,'' Casey explained,
``strings, strings playing pizzicato, flute, trumpet, cymbal
crashes, whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering the information into the computer is a time-devouring
process. Casey estimates that he must spend on average three or
four hours for each minute of music. So ``Salome,'' a two-hour
opera, could take anywhere from 360 to a staggering 600 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Once completed, Casey ``performs'' the score by simply sitting
at the computer, punching keys and controlling the flow as the
music emits from speakers placed discreetly around the stage. Casey
and Leighton make much of the fact that tempos, phrasing and shape
in the virtual orchestra are worked out carefully during rehearsals
with the singers and that tempo, at least, can be adjusted by Casey
during a performance. But to do more than slight adjustments on the
spot is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   And dynamics, once set, are fixed. Gone, it would seem, is the
possibility for a singer to shape a phase in performance with a
slightly different inflection from what she did in rehearsal,
trusting that an alert conductor and sensitive orchestra players
will catch the difference and respond accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   As for the sound of the virtual orchestra, those listeners
accustomed to hearing orchestra tracks on pop and rock records and
in film scores, where this computer audio technology is most
common, will probably have an easier time accepting a virtual
orchestra's performance of ``Salome.'' I found it weird.
</P>
<P>
   Even when, say, a clarinet sounded sort of like a clarinet, the
tone seemed synthetic. The strings have an accordionlike quality.
Crescendos have a way of leaping out at you. One reminded me of
when the organist at Yankee Stadium gives an unintended extra nudge
to the swell pedal and a clipped chord jumps out of a melodic line
in an odd place (``Take me out  &UR; to &LR;  the ball game'').
</P>
<P>
   At full volume, Strauss' low brass and horns had a buzzing
quality, like the rude, blasting sounds made by the alien spaceship
in ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind'' when it answers the
earthlings' five-note musical greeting. And because the sound emits
from speakers, the spatial separation of instruments that is the
hallmark of a live orchestra is gone. Admittedly ``Salome,'' with
its famously voluptuous orchestration, is particularly hard to
replicate virtually. But Operaworks chose it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Leighton says that once composers get accustomed to the virtual
orchestra, they will start to compose for it, or at least
incorporate its resources into the standard orchestra. But
composing new music for this new technology is one thing. Trying to
recreate the sound of a Mozart or Strauss orchestra with
computerized, rhythmically constricting high-tech resources, no
matter how sophisticated, will always be frustrating, like getting
a kiss over the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the musicians' union, Local 802, which is fiercely
protective of its members' rights and the status quo, has paid
little attention to Operaworks productions. The virtual orchestra
must seem an unlikely threat to the livelihood of classical
musicians. But that's what pop musicians once thought. Orchestras
were once used regularly for everything from soaring string tracks
on Motown songs to disco. Nowadays, if the sound of an orchestra is
desired in pop, it is as likely provided by digital keyboards and
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Operaworks would seem for now to be almost alone among classical
organizations in adopting this technology. Expect virtual
instruments to invade the Broadway orchestra pit, already the
domain of digital keyboards and ear-numbing amplification systems.
</P>
<P>
   Leighton is quick to compare his use of a virtual orchestra
favorably to the occasional use by many ballet companies of
recordings in place of live musicians. ``We are one step up from
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not entirely a fair comparison. For example, during
the recent two-week Stravinsky festival at the New York City
Ballet, the company's fine orchestra had to prepare 18 difficult
Stravinsky scores. In two additional cases the company used
recordings: the complex ``Movements for Piano and Orchestra'' and
``Les Noces,'' with a cumbersome scoring involving full chorus and
four pianos, far too cumbersome for an orchestra pit. Most critics
would say this represented a fair compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Casey says the high cost of hiring union orchestras is
``strangling opera in America.'' Actually opera is thriving in the
United States as never before, and a lot more can be accomplished
if smaller companies concentrate on less well-known or small-scale
works and let the major houses take care of ``Parsifal'' and
``Salome.''
</P>
<P>
   Leighton maintains that, by using a virtual orchestra, his
company can focus on developing a close ensemble of singing actors.
But the Operaworks performance of ``Salome'' was woefully uneven
vocally, with a gifted soprano in the title role who probably
should not have been attempting this famously taxing music and a
couple of singers in supporting roles who were undone by the vocal
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   It may be hard to recruit solid singers into something that
looks so gimmicky. Leighton should consider whether in his desire
to direct a company he is giving young singers chances or leading
them astray.
</P>
<P>
   As opera becomes more popular, there will be increased pressure
to make it less expensive and more accessible. As in pop music, the
virtual orchestra may creep into the field.
</P>
<P>
   What's the harm? My unscientific polling after a ``Salome''
performance found many people either intrigued by the virtual
orchestra or blase about it. One man who professed enthusiasm
claimed to be an avid operagoer.
</P>
<P>
   We have virtual special effects in the movies, virtual
simulations of space travel at science parks and now the virtual
orchestra. What next? A virtual soprano to sing Salome? Don't
laugh. It may be coming. &QL;

THE OTHER DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE COURTS VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ While Vice President Al Gore launched his
presidential campaign Wednesday from his hometown in Tennessee, his
rival for the Democratic nomination was in California trying to get
noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, the former New Jersey senator and New York Knicks
basketball star, is using a 10-day trip through California to draw
attention to his uphill bid for the Democratic Party's presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Gore holds a strong edge in early polling. The most recent
Time/CNN poll showed that 71 percent of Democrats expect Gore to be
their nominee, while 13 percent said Bradley would win the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, the nomination is Al Gore's to lose,'' said
Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley has a strategy he believes could upset the vice
president: connecting one-on-one with Democratic voters in an
empathetic style reminiscent of Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was in San Francisco on Tuesday talking to two groups
that traditionally have been Democratic stalwarts _
environmentalists and advocates of abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does anyone have a particular story they want to share with
me?'' Bradley asked a dozen staff members at Planned Parenthood in
San Francisco Tuesday afternoon, an event where reporters and
photographers outnumbered participants.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a circle of chairs next to his wife, Ernestine, the
6-foot-5-inch former senator listened as Planned Parenthood staff
members told of almost daily protests by anti-abortion rights
activists outside their clinics, threats of violence against
doctors and lawsuits filed against employees for alleged civil
rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``So basically what you're facing are multiple levels of
assault,'' said Bradley, a supporter of abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   He used a similar approach in a morning session with
environmentalists on how to divide California's limited water
supply between competing factions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are your thoughts?'' he asked a larger circle of three
dozen, mostly members of local conservation groups who were invited
to the event.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley largely avoided bashing the vice president. Pressed by
reporters on what made him different from Gore, Bradley would say
only that he had ``a more varied life experience'' than the vice
president, who has spent most of his career in government in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He also pointed to a difference in leadership style. While the
two men were in the Senate, Bradley said he tackled the
controversial issues of tax reform and international trade. Gore,
he said, ``has been more cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   The perception that Gore, 51, has been stumbling as he launches
his campaign has helped Bradley, Jeffe said. But while Bradley, 55,
has a ``celebrity aura,'' he cannot match the vice president's
party ties and prodigious fund-raising ability, she said.
</P>
<P>
   For Bradley to win the nomination, Jeffe said, it would take ``a
really dramatic stumble on the part of Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Gregory, a board member of the Save San Francisco Bay
Association, said she would be pleased with either of the two
Democrats as the party's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both strong on the environment,'' Gregory said. ``It's
a tough one.''
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates will be in California on Friday, and will be
plowing similar thematic ground.
</P>
<P>
   Gore flies to Los Angeles that morning for a summit on guns and
school violence at a high school gym. Bradley will be in San
Francisco that day for speeches, also addressing guns and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley represented New Jersey in the Senate for three terms,
from 1979 to 1996.

MORE AT STAKE THAN EVER FOR DUNCAN, CAMBY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Want to know about the most intriguing matchup in the NBA
Finals? Ask John Calipari. Surely the former New Jersey Nets and
University of Massachusetts coach won't be a casual observer when
the New York Knicks meet the San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   Not when you consider that he coached budding Knicks star Marcus
Camby in college and helped him prepare to face then-Wake Forest
star Tim Duncan in a Dec. 5, 1995, contest that was one of the most
eagerly anticipated big-man matchups in college basketball history.
</P>
<P>
   That game showcased what many figured to be the future of the
NBA post game. And here they are, meeting in the Finals. Calipari,
who also coached against both players while he was with New Jersey,
is not surprised that they meet again with basketball's biggest
prize on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim Duncan is one of the best strong-side players in the
game,'' said Calipari. ``He is the kind of player you get the ball
to and he scores and he blocks shots at the other end and makes
everyone around him better. He is better on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marcus is better off the ball. I thought the last two years in
the NBA that Dennis Rodman was the best weak-side player. When it
came to rebounding, defense, scoring, he was ridiculous. But now
he's gone, and now Marcus Camby is the best weak-side player in the
NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Knicks ran no plays to him and he had 36 points against
Indiana last week. Everything the Pacers did, they had to keep
looking around, going, `Where's Camby?' The Knicks were getting
their butts handed to them by Indiana, and then Marcus would come
in and the Pacers started getting their butts handed to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Question is, who will have the upper hand? Back in 1995, Camby
emerged the victor. Bolstered by a partisan sellout crowd at
Amherst, he led the third-ranked Minutemen to a 60-46 victory over
10-ranked Wake Forest.
</P>
<P>
   It was billed as the biggest big-man matchup in the regular
season since Virginia's Ralph Sampson faced Georgetown's Patrick
Ewing on Dec. 11, 1982.
</P>
<P>
   According to UMass players, Camby downplayed the matchup, at
least on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he was excited to play against Tim Duncan, but he just
was telling guys to just go out there and play and not feeling any
pressure,'' said former UMass forward Donta Bright, who was the
game's leading scorer with 22 points. ``He didn't worry about the
matchup between him and Duncan. He just went out there and let
everyone judge for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   While Camby might have been telling his teammates it was just
another game, he didn't approach it that way, according to
Calipari.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he prepared for that game well,'' said Calipari. ``He
knew how important it was for him to play well against Duncan.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither player was spectacular. Duncan scored 9 points on
4-of-18 shooting from the floor, though he did grab 12 rebounds and
block 4 shots, and even sank a trey. But he struggled in the one
area many people were wondering about before the game: intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Not so for Camby. Though he wasn't much better numberswise (17
points on 6-for-19 shooting, 9 boards, 3 blocks), he was emotional
and energetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I remember, Camby played with more bounce _ his legs were
more alive,'' said Wake Forest coach Dave Odom. ``For Tim, it was a
great learning experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Odom noted that Duncan had faced other dominant centers in the
Atlantic Coast Conference, including North Carolina's Rasheed
Wallace. But the contest against Camby was different because of the
media attention and because it marked the first time a Duncan-led
team headed to the Northeast for a major game.
</P>
<P>
   Odom said he stayed with Duncan in the locker room following the
contest until everyone else had left.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was extremely disappointed with his performance after the
game, and I was disappointed we didn't get ball to him more,'' said
Odom. ``I remember we sat in chairs in the locker room and we both
had our heads down. And then we both raised our heads at the same
time and looked at each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'll never forget this as long as I live: He said, `Do you
still love me?' And I said, `I think I would have loved you more if
you had played better and we won, but yes, I still love you.' Then
we laughed and got ready to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The career paths of Duncan and Camby were different. Duncan
stayed in college for four years and was the first overall pick in
the 1997 NBA draft, by the Spurs. He was named Rookie of the Year
last season and was a finalist for Player of the Year this season,
helping San Antonio reach the Finals for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Camby led UMass to the Final Four of the 1995-96 season, then
left school early and was the second overall pick in the 1996 draft
by Toronto. The Raptors hoped he would be a building block, and he
showed occasional glimpses of greatness, but he had many detractors
in his first two injury-plagued seasons. Toronto traded Camby to
New York last offseason, and after a sluggish start he has returned
to the form that helped bring unprecedented success to UMass.
</P>
<P>
   This has left Calipari wondering what would have happened if the
Nets brass had listened to his pleas to acquire Camby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to trade for him 10 times,'' said Calipari, who was
fired by the Nets during the regular season. ``The people in the
Nets organization kept saying, `He's not good enough. You're
putting yourself on the line. You just want to bring in your former
players.' And I kept telling them, `You're nuts.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Duncan found a good team coming out of college. Camby went to
an expansion team. And at that time, I told Isiah (Thomas, then the
Raptors general manager) that you can't expect him to be a
dominating center, but if you put him with good other good players,
he'll make it an outstanding team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy for him, because when he first arrived here,
everyone was so down on him, and it seemed as if I was the only one
saying he was going to be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, many people are echoing Calipari's sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   According to Odom, Camby, Duncan, Wallace (now with Portland),
and Kevin Garnett of Minnesota represent the future of the NBA post
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a matter of circumstances, and both continue to
amaze me,'' said Odom. ``I don't think you would be talking about
Camby if Patrick Ewing or Larry Johnson were healthy. Even though I
think Camby is better than both, (Knicks coach) Jeff Van Gundy
would have to play Ewing and Johnson ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim's situation was drawn out from a cluster of Ping-Pong
balls and then he fit into the situation. But I think those four
centers have 10 good years each ahead of them if they just
concentrate on the game and winning and don't worry about the money
and endorsements and everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Calipari had a better supporting cast around Camby in college,
and if he were Van Gundy, he would play Camby only on Duncan, with
the hopes that the two would negate each other and the Knicks would
win the matchups at the other positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say to Marcus, `We don't want to double-team Duncan;
you have to play him alone,' '' said Calipari. ``I would get the
other big guys to beat up David Robinson. And then I would hope
that Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston would bet the better of
Mario Elie and Sean Elliott.''

GOATS CHOMP AWAY AT FIRE HAZARDS IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGUNA BEACH, Calif. _ To the untrained eye, the hilltops
offering spectacular ocean views are an empty, ugly yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Fire prevention specialist Michael Phillips sees safety in the
barren spaces between the soaring houses with floor-to-ceiling
windows.
</P>
<P>
   The goats see only their last meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could do worse in this world than be a Laguna goat,'' said
Phillips, who works for the city's fire department. ``Some people
say the goats leave the land looking kind of desolate. I say the
goats are going to save lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Devastated by wildfires that leveled 286 homes and partially
damaged 35, destroyed more than 16,500 acres and forced the city's
evacuation in 1993, Laguna Beach set out to find a way to contain
future fires without bankrupting its budget. The city settled on
goats, an all-natural firefighting techique so effective that Los
Angeles County to the north is shopping for a herd of its own.
</P>
<P>
   In Laguna Beach, the 700 or so goats that munch on city grass
and brittle brush 365 days a year are so beloved that some
homeowners time parties to coincide with their arrival in the
neighborhood. From their balconies, they sip wine and watch the
herd work. Others in this beachside city of 24,500 have urged the
city to put the goats to full use and turn their milk into
marketable feta cheese.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love it when the goats come around,'' said homeowner
Jane Eastman, who a year ago moved into a Laguna Beach neighborhood
that was flattened by the 1993 fires. ``You've taken the coyotes
away with all this building. You've taken a lot of the charm away.
The goats give us back a little bit of the country feel.''
</P>
<P>
   As southern and northern California cities head into fire
season, which starts in May and can run through December depending
on the amount of rainfall, the ambiance that the goats offer is
secondary to the security they provide. Since 1995, the goats have
helped clear 1,500 acres a year in Laguna Beach alone, creating
breaks in the fire line and making it harder for flames to spread
from one spot to another. The cost: $196,000 a year, or about $140
per acre.
</P>
<P>
   ``An advantage of using goats is that they can work in steep and
difficult terrain,'' said Phillips. ``And they're more
cost-effective because after 5 p.m. they're still working and
eating and you don't have to pay them overtime or haul any brush
out. They're an all-purpose piece of equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``equipment'' is owned by a rancher who lives just outside
Laguna Beach. His herd, however, lives wherever the work is, penned
in by movable electric fences. So do the two Peruvian herders who
transport them around town _ usually with dogs, sometimes in trucks
_ and who stay nearby in trailers.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day, one of the trailers was parked high above the
city, in a neighborhood where only a handful of houses survived the
1993 fires. Since then, almost everyone has rebuilt or is in the
process of rebuilding homes that are intended to be as fireproof as
buildings can be. That means lots of glass and steel and concrete _
and the sound of goats chomping away, almost in their backyards,
several weeks a year. Once a year, the goats can also be spotted
downtown, on the browning hill above City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   As resident Chris Mattingley recently put it, ``It's like living
on a farm for a month. They've got to cut down the weeds somehow,
and it's either the goats or loud tractors.''
</P>
<P>
   Laguna Beach, which got the idea for the goats from the Berkeley
Hills area in northern California, has long since shelved its
tractors. Hand crews, which can cost three times as much to clear
the same land as goats, have also been eliminated. Residents who do
not keep their private property free of brush are threatened with
the goats and a tax lien to pay for their dining.
</P>
<P>
   Now Los Angeles County is considering doing the same on some of
its more fire-prone property, a proposal that would bring goats to
a 113-acre firebreak in Malibu's Santa Monica Mountains as well as
to 120 acres of open space in the city of Claremont. If the herd
proves effective, it could be expanded countywide.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Spitzer, assistant chief of the LA County Fire
Department's forestry division, said the goats would be part of an
effort to fight fire creatively, although they would not eliminate
the need for other procedures such as controlled burns, bulldozing
or hand crews. Still, he added, the county is confident enough of
the goats' ability to eat away at fire hazards that it has applied
for a $161,360 grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency
to pay for the demonstration project.
</P>
<P>
   Approval of the county's environmental impact study is pending.
In the meantime, the grass and other brush in the test area are
being allowed to grow wild, just the way the goats like it. The
still-to-be-hired herd is not expected to be on the job before next
year, too late to chew into this year's fire season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't want the goats eating up landscaping or doing
environmental damage, but when we looked at Laguna Beach's program,
we saw that it could be done,'' said Spitzer. ``It's an interesting
project, and we think it will work.''
</P>
<P>
   The county is convinced of the goats' cost-effectiveness. A
fiscal impact study prepared for FEMA put the cost of hand crews at
$1,750 an acre. Herbicides, on the wane along with public
acceptance of their use, cost $350 per acre. Heavy equipment, such
as chippers, can run $275 an acre, while prescribed fire costs
$250. The goats come in at $225 to $300 per acre.
</P>
<P>
   County Supervisor Miachel Antonovich, whose district includes
Claremont, has described them as a ``bargain'' for taxpayers. And
taxpayers seem to be responding. His deputy, Jennifer Weston, said
their office has been flooded with callers offering goats.
</P>
<P>
   ``A ton of people have said they have them and we can use
them,'' Weston said. ``I have no idea where people are getting all
these goats. But they do seem to like the idea of using them for
fire prevention.''

TIGER NOW TAMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ It was evident two weeks ago at the Memorial
in Dublin, Ohio, where Tiger Woods won for the second time in three
weeks, that his demeanor has changed. Now his sights are set on the
99th US Open, which begins Thursday over the hallowed No. 2 course
at Pinehurst Resort &AMP; CC. What did Woods do last week? Relax and
practice.
</P>
<P>
   He is at ease in these surroundings, on a course in the
sandhills designed by Donald Ross.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it a lot,'' said Woods. ``The golf course is playing a
little more friendly than I thought it would. I thought the rough
would be higher, the fairways narrower.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, whose best finish in this championship was joint 18th a
year ago, has won twice on the PGA Tour this year and also captured
the Deutsche Bank Open in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my game is definitely better than it was at the
Memorial,'' Woods said. ``I've been doing a little work, and I saw
things that we didn't like.''
</P>
<P>
   He and swing guru Butch Harmon watched tapes of his two straight
wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We analyzed both swings and saw a big difference,'' said
Woods. ``We made those changes, and they're starting to come
together. It's posture, swing plane, the way I was coming down.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not his more relaxed demeanor that has many thinking Woods
is on target to win his second major; there has been a general
improvement in his game, and the Pinehurst course has been softened
by rain the past two days. He can bust it here, something he
couldn't do at the last two US Opens, at Congressional and the
Olympic Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you hit the ball poorly in US Opens, you're not going to be
around,'' said Woods. ``Fortunately I was able to chip and putt and
get it around good enough where I was making cuts, but I wasn't in
contention. That's also one of the reasons I changed my game, to
become more consistent, to shape the shots correctly. When I do
miss it, it's not fairways like it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm learning how to play the game. I'm only 23, and I have a
long way to go. I recognize that. I've come a long way as well, and
I've learned by watching other players play. I'm not afraid to go
out on the golf course and apply what I've learned.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who won a junior tournament on Pinehurst No. 2 when he
was 16, said the course has changed a lot, with new greens, and
strategy will be important.
</P>
<P>
   ``This course from tee to green is very simple,'' he said.
``It's around the greens where it becomes complicated, and because
of that I think you need to spend extra time chipping and putting,
not just on the course but on the practice green, to try to get a
feel of the shots you're going to have to use.''
</P>
<P>
   Wider fairways and rough that at 3 inches seems negligible favor
Woods and the longer hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the wider landing areas, it provides an opportunity for
you to use a longer club,'' said Woods. ``You can use a driver or
3-wood and not necessarily an iron off the tee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fairways are a little softer, so you can hit it out there
and know if the ball lands in the fairway it's going to stay. If
you get the ball in the rough and you have a difficult lie, you've
got to be conservative and leave the ball short so it's not going
to zip over the green. It's not good over the green, and that's the
way it's been designed. Short is fine. You can get up and down from
short of the green.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation that these greens will be similar to
those at Augusta National, where Woods won the Masters in
record-setting fashion two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Augusta is different,'' he said, ``because they have quadrants
to hit to. Their quadrants are smaller, and their slopes are
steeper. Here the greens aren't that severe once you get on the
putting surface.''
</P>
<P>
   In every interview this year, Woods is asked about his
``rivalry'' with David Duval, whom he will meet in a head-to-head
match this summer in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either he's played great and I haven't played so good, or it's
vice versa,'' said Woods. ``We haven't done it together in the same
tournament. It will happen one day. The odds are in our favor.''

WISH THE TV DINNER A HAPPY 45TH, ONLY DON'T CALL IT THAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NATHAN COBB  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the beginning, there were frozen turkeys. There were 10
railroad cars filled with frozen turkeys. Or maybe there were 12.
Or 11. Gerry Thomas really isn't sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is that there were a mess of them and we couldn't
find a home for them,'' the 77-year-old Thomas recalls, referring
to the January day in 1954 when he had a stone cold problem on his
hands. It seems that Thomas's employer, Omaha-based C. A. Swanson &AMP;
Sons, needed to get rid of a passel of turkeys that hadn't made the
holiday cut. His solution: a frozen dinner consisting of turkey,
dressing, gravy, cornbread, peas, and sweet potatoes, all ladled
with ice cream scoops into a partitioned metal tray. His idea for a
name: the ``TV Dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thought I was crazy,'' muses Thomas, who now lives
in Arizona. ``It was a huge gamble, and it never should have
succeeded.''
</P>
<P>
   Success? Only 5,000 to 6,000 of those original 98-cent TV
dinners were produced. Within a year, Thomas recalls, 10 million
more had been shipped. As many as 300 million were annually turned
out in subsequent years. A uniquely American cuisine _ if that's
the right word _ had been born. Swanson dropped the name ``TV
Dinner'' in 1960, but has resurrected it (through the end of June)
in honor of its 45th anniversary, along with the original six-color
packaging that features a wood-grain TV and plastic knobs. In
March, Thomas was rewarded for his contribution when he placed his
handprints in the sidewalk outside Mann's Chinese Theater in
Hollywood, right between those of Ron Howard and Sean Connery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just trying to get rid of turkeys, not build a
business,'' says Thomas. ``It's an incredible story.''
</P>
<P>
   It is incredible, too, that the type of meal Thomas begat is
still a staple of supermarket frozen-food cases 45 years after its
accidental birth. Frozen dinner receipts exceed $1 billion a year,
their sales curve neither rising sharply nor dropping
precipitously. They are just kind of there, quietly selling about
600 million units annually despite the explosive popularity of
fresh, grab-and-go ``home meal replacement'' fare being peddled
over the counter by food stores. Roughly half of us buy at least
one frozen dinner each year, whether we admit it or not. Sales have
been helped considerably through the years by the proliferation of
microwave ovens, the emergence of the working couple, and the
frantic pace of our lives.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the TV dinner _ and who can resist still calling it that?
_ has always had an image problem. Remember the old joke _ that the
best way to consume one of these things was to throw away the food
and eat the package? ``There's been a certain stigma associated
with the trayed meal over the years which is hard to shake,''
points out Warren Thayer, editor in chief of Frozen Food Age, a
trade publication. ``Still, there'll always be a place for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most frozen-dinner processors _ the major players are Nestle
USA, ConAgra Frozen Foods, and Vlasic Foods International (Swanson)
_ would rather discuss trendier products. Mention the D word and
they are likely to change the subject to more upscale frozen
entrees. (A frozen dinner is defined by the US Department of
Agriculture as having at least three components, consisting of
meat, poultry, cheese, eggs, vegetables, fruit, potatoes, rice, or
other cereal-based products. An entree is a principal dish or main
course, and can include a single vegetable.) Few companies actually
label their dinners ``dinners,'' in part because they don't want
the product seen as something that can be eaten only around
sundown. Until this year, Swanson hadn't run a television ad for
its frozen dinners in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do meals, not dinners,'' emphasizes Roz O'Hearn, director
of division and brand affairs for Nestle USA's frozen business,
which includes the Stouffer's and Lean Cuisine lines.
</P>
<P>
   And when they're talking about those frozen meals, executives
such as O'Hearn would prefer to focus on newer products _ such as
``skillet'' meals, ``bowl'' meals that can be microwaved, and
large-portion meals suitable for feeding a whole family _ rather
than the trayed descendants of the TV dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when you meander along the frozen-food cases of your
local supermarket, you won't find a shortage of such reliable
dinners-in-trays as chicken, turkey, and Salisbury steak. (With the
likes of pot roast, beef tips, and meatloaf mixed in.) Ethnicity
tends to run along the lines of lasagna or enchiladas. Exotica
generally involves tinkering with chicken: chicken Dijon, glazed
chicken, herb-roasted chicken, etc. And the taste? ``Generally just
so-so,'' declared Consumer Reports in a recent test of frozen meals
and entrees.
</P>
<P>
   Frozen dinners tend to have broad appeal, but some of us enjoy
heating and eating them more than others do. Least likely to reach
for them are young singles, childless couples, and new families.
They're also less popular with African-Americans than with whites.
Blue-collar families, older couples, and elderly singles are strong
buyers, as well as a group that a recent National Frozen Food
Association survey described as the ``Hectic Have-Tos'':
convenience-dependent folks who lead fast-paced lives. On the other
end of the scale in this study were the ``Frozen Rejectors,''
a.k.a. ``confident cooks.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gerry Thomas concocted his TV Dinner 45 years ago, frozen
foods had already been around for nearly a quarter of a century. A
few airlines had even tried feeding frozen dinners, called
``Strato-Plates,'' to passengers during the 1940s. But it was
Thomas who brought precooked meals to the masses. ``Even back then,
women were working outside the home in greater numbers,'' he says.
``They were looking for something fast to fix for their kids,
something that wouldn't give them a guilt complex. And, of course,
there were no fast-food chains.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales of frozen dinners eventually flattened out during the late
1970s, but rose again in the 1980s with lower-calorie offerings.
And the baby boom kids, who had been trained on TV dinners, liked
them just fine. The dinners persevere today, the vast majority
still in trays, even with innovations such as bowls and bags. They
are an enduring slice of American pie that won't go away, despite
their image problem and an industry that often seems to treat them
like . . . well, like an unwanted guest at the dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I could never find a man that admitted eating a TV
Dinner,'' Thomas says. ``Women would admit it, but not men. My
conclusion was that we had an awful lot of closet TV Dinner
eaters.''

   Now that the air strikes against Yugoslavia have been stopped,
the world community will have to assess the damage and draw lessons
from the events of these past months. We should not allow the
misguided and unwarranted bombing operation to be followed by
hollow proclamations of victory.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the plight of the Kosovars, the destruction of much
of the essential infrastructure in the rest of Yugoslavia and the
tremendous damage to international relations, any triumphalist
statements are jarring. Claims of victory are being made by those,
on either side, who must be troubled by the thought of being held
accountable for what has happened to Yugoslavia. Make no mistake
about it: The outcome is a tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   As president of Green Cross International, a non-government
environmental organization that was among the first to sound the
alarm about environmental consequences of NATO's military action, I
feel duty bound to continue the discussion of this vitally
important subject. Some might now be tempted to ask: Was the threat
perhaps exaggerated? Could nature be much more resilient to the
impact of war than we thought? But this is a dangerous complacency
that could serve all of us badly.
</P>
<P>
   Let us recall the effects of the hostilities that followed
Saddam Hussein's aggression against Kuwait. The data cited at an
International Conference on the Environmental Consequences of War
held in Washington in June 1998 indicate that these consequences
are of a long-term nature. Scientists and environmental experts
estimate that 40 percent of Kuwait's strategic water resources have
been irreversibly polluted with oil. Quite alarming are the reports
of health problems among U.S. and British soldiers who fought in
that war problems that now also affect their children.
</P>
<P>
   I might add that the environmental and medical consequences of
the war in Iraq itself are, for reasons that are well known, not
widely covered by the media or studied by scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Military action against Yugoslavia included extensive use of
weapons containing depleted uranium. Such weapons burn at high
temperatures, producing poisonous clouds of uranium oxide that
dissolve in the pulmonary and bronchial fluids. Anyone within the
radius of 300 meters from the epicenter of the explosion inhales
large amounts of such particles.
</P>
<P>
   Although radiation levels produced by the external source are
quite low, the internal radiation source damages various types of
cells in the human body, destroys chromosomes and affects the
reproductive system.
</P>
<P>
   We are told by officials that depleted uranium components are
harmless and that DU weapons are therefore a legitimate means of
warfare. Let us recall, however, that many military and political
leaders initially believed and some seem to believe even now that
nuclear weapons too are quite ``conventional,'' albeit a more
powerful kind of weaponry. Do we need another, ``slow Hiroshima''
to understand this new mistake?
</P>
<P>
   We must now call for a comprehensive expert analysis of the
environmental situation in Yugoslavia and other countries in the
region and in the Danube basin. This should be a priority task. But
we must do more than just that.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that military conflicts in our time can cause both a
human and an environmental catastrophe makes the task of preventing
them even more urgent and important. Prevention must be foremost in
our thinking and our actions. But, if hostilities break out despite
all our efforts, they must be constrained by certain legal limits.
Such constraints have been laid down by the Geneva conventions and
their protocols. It is now clear that they should be supplemented
by provisions to limit the environmental damage caused by warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, I believe that strikes against certain industries
and infrastructure, such as nuclear power stations and some
chemical and petrochemical plants, must be prohibited. Similarly,
we should prohibit weapons whose use may have particularly
dangerous, long-term and massive environmental and medical
consequences. In my view, weapons containing depleted uranium
should be among the first considered for such a ban.
</P>
<P>
   The time has come to convene a second conference on the
environmental consequences of war in order to discuss thoroughly
and in depth issues of this kind. It could adopt some urgently
needed amendments to international law and create a mechanism to
continue this work. It should also address the need for an
emergency fund to finance measures to deal with the aftermath of
environmental catastrophes. Recent events only underscore the
urgency of this initiative, which I put forward at the Washington
conference in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists, political leaders and public opinion should
now demonstrate that we can learn the right lessons from the
tragedies of the 20th century. The human drama and the drama of
nature should be of equal concern to us. They should sound a call
to responsible action.

CLUB OF QUEENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLAINE, Minn. _ One of Ghana's queens, dressed in her soccer
gear, raises three fingers. She has spent the previous five minutes
laughing and smiling. Not now. This is serious. Her team will play
Australia Sunday at Foxboro Stadium. It's a World Cup game. The
queen says her team will win. She says the team will score a lot,
too.
</P>
<P>
   How much?
</P>
<P>
   ``Three goals,'' says the queen, Vivian Mensah, with fingers
raised. Before she can continue, the assistant coach sitting next
to her interrupts. ``Three goals is the minimum,'' says Jones Nana
Ofosuhene. ``I can't tell you what the maximum is.''
</P>
<P>
   These are strange words, but not for the reasons you might
think.
</P>
<P>
   A soccer-playing queen from Ghana in Minnesota? Nothing unusual
about that. There were several of them here as recently as Tuesday,
practicing at the National Sports Center. Their practice _ in which
they mixed phrases in English, Twi, and, unexpectedly, French _ was
held between a soccer stadium and a bicycle track, a place so
suburban that the only consistent music is provided by birds. They
concentrated with the help of head coach Emmanuel Afranie, a stern
man who once studied ``football'' on both sides of the Berlin Wall.
Afranie is also a proud father of eight children, a father who
notes that Sunday is Father's Day, so ``The girls have promised a
win as a present,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Queens predicting victory? What queen doesn't before a battle?
Not only do they have something for Australia, but Cup co-favorite
China ``is not better than us,'' explains another queen, Alberta
Sackey. ``We can't say they are better until they beat us on
neutral ground. If that happens, we will know they are better.''
</P>
<P>
   What is surprising is that these Ghanaian women from West
Africa, who call themselves the Black Queens, talk so confidently
even when most soccer observers give them no chance of advancing
out of Group D, a group led by the Chinese. Oddsmaker Danny
Sheridan has pegged them with 1,000-1 odds of winning the Cup,
worst of any team in the 16-team field. (The United States is 1-1.)
The Nigerians, who finished ahead of Ghana in the African Women's
Soccer Championships, have 500-1 odds.
</P>
<P>
   None of this bothers the Black Queens or their supporters. A
Ghanaian and four-year Minneapolis resident, Richard Attoh,
suggested they train here for two weeks. He assured Afranie there
would be no distractions since it is 15 miles north of Minneapolis.
Attoh is told about the odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's nice,'' he says. ``We appreciate it. We have no
worries. In our games against China, they won both games on penalty
kicks in the 90th minute. People are looking at Mensah as our best
player, but we have five players who are just as good.''
</P>
<P>
   Attoh has an uncle in Worcester, Mass., so he will travel here
this weekend and watch the Black Queens try to win. He will be with
them when they travel to Portland, Ore., for their match against
the Chinese. He will be in Chicago for the match against Sweden,
the June 26 match that is supposed to send the Ghanaians back to
their capital, Accra.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way that happens,'' says Ofosuhene, the assistant coach.
``Super no way.''
</P>
<P>
   They cannot go back home on June 26 or June 27 because . . .
because, well, have you ever seen a queen sweat? You know, the kind
of sweat that comes when you push your body to its limit; the kind
of sweat when you run through the hills, punishing your calves and
thighs; the kind of sweat when you are on the beach, attempting to
scale coconut trees?
</P>
<P>
   That's why this team cannot imagine going home after three
matches. Long before they kicked soccer balls in Minnesota at the
beginning of this month and before their plane arrived in New
England this morning, the Black Queens were preparing for this Cup.
Sweating for this Cup. They started with six weeks of training,
training in which they did not even see a ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 prerequisite for modern football is a conditioned
body,'' Afranie says. ``In Africa, most of the players are
skillful. But most of them are not physically well-conditioned.''
</P>
<P>
   Afranie, who received a coaching diploma from the University of
Sports and Physical Culture in Leipzig, East Germany, believes
those words. He believed them so much that he told his team to run
through Accra's Macarthy Hills. He then told them to run by the
beautiful waterfronts and take to the trees, testing their
strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ignorant people hear that part, about tree-climbing, and they
might call us monkeys,'' Ofosuhene says.
</P>
<P>
   But Afranie obviously doesn't care about that type of criticism.
The American concept of political correctness is not in his
thoughts when he says, ``Since FIFA has no different set of rules
for female football, we had to condition ourselves to play like
men. It is a game for those who are fit. This is not table tennis,
it is a contact sport.''
</P>
<P>
   No one will disagree with that. The United States and China play
the game at a high level. The tournament pairings are such that the
two are on course to meet each other in the final.
</P>
<P>
   ``To overlook Africa is a mistake,'' Afranie says. ``The good
people of our country have confidence in our team. Therefore, we
are not going to let down the people back home. We'll try our best
to silence the forecasters, the critics.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the critics don't know that the Queens took a trip to
China before Cup play started. They went to play two exhibitions,
traveling through Amsterdam and Milan before finally arriving in
Beijing. Because of the significant time difference between home
and China, they said they requested to push the match back a day or
two so their bodies could recover. ``We traveled all night,'' says
Sackey, the team's captain. ``We asked them to postpone, they
didn't, and they still could only manage a 2-1 victory,'' Afranie
adds.
</P>
<P>
   They are asked if they have seen the United States play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't compare ourselves to teams outside our group,''
Sackey says.
</P>
<P>
   If it sounds as if Queen Sackey has mastered the art of American
sports discussion, she has. This is her first trip to the States,
but she has quickly absorbed some of the subtleties. Asked about
her impression of American life, she says, ``I can't give you a
true opinion because we have only been here in Minnesota, where it
is quiet. We haven't gone out much. We have been here, playing
cards. After we see Portland and Chicago, then I can tell you
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. Team guard Rashid Amah, a pleasant man with a prominent
gold tooth, hasn't had to shield the team much in the past two
weeks. But, he says, there are a lot of distractions in the bigger
cities. The good thing is that his people, Ghanaians, will be
around. The discouraging thing is that large cities bring more
options.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like this one place back home,'' he says with a smile.
``They've got everything there: good guys and bad guys, great
restaurants, great clubs, beautiful people, and not-so-beautiful
people. All in one place.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing can get in the way of winning. Nothing. They say they
are determined to take something memorable back to the
approximately 18 million residents of their country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am hoping that our performance in the tournament paves the
way for female players in Ghana,'' Afranie says. ``I hope there is
a greater interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Afranie spoke those words, he watched the queens kick
during practice. A few fans watched from a nearby hill. They heard
the players chanting in what many must have thought was Twi, Ga, or
English. It wasn't; it was French. They were reciting a chant the
men from France used during the 1998 World Cup. It was the chant of
victory. You see, the French won the Cup in '98. And if a queen is
to follow anyone, that someone had better be a champion.

IN BEIRUT, PONDERING BARAK AS PEACEMAKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT _ On an April night 26 years ago, an Israeli commando in
a brunette wig, blue eyeshadow, and a long dress that concealed a
machine gun snuck into the heart of this city and led an operation
to assassinate three top Palestinian guerrilla leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Long-time residents of the street in the fashionable Verdun
district remember the brazen raid, and are shocked to learn that
the commando in drag who led it will become prime minister of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Ehud Barak's role in one of Israel's boldest undercover
operations was just one of many exploits that would make him the
most highly decorated soldier in Israel's history and help pave his
path to power.
</P>
<P>
   Some people on this Beirut street and others throughout the Arab
world wonder if a man so steeped in war can make the transformation
to statesman. But in a region where often only a fierce fighter is
trusted to make peace, there are many Arabs as well as Israelis who
said they believe Barak will follow the region's other
warriors-turned-peacemakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he's still Rambo, maybe he's not. We can only hope he's
changed,'' said Minhaim Abu Al Muna, who was concierge of the
building when the commandos stormed it in the predawn on April 10,
1973.
</P>
<P>
   During the raid, the Barak-led unit landed under cover of
darkness on a beach in Beirut. The commandos, three of whom were
disguised as women, stormed a block of buildings and killed PLO
political leader Mohammed Al Najjar, whose nomme de guerre was
``Abu Yussef,'' Kamal Adwan, who headed the PLO's West Bank
resistance, and Kamal Nasser, a PLO spokesman and poet.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese officials stated that nine others were killed in the
operation. They included Najjar's wife, two Lebanese policemen, two
Lebanese civilians, three Syrian workers, and an Italian woman.
Some 20 other Lebanese citizens were wounded, according to press
reports.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, Muna, the former concierge, played
backgammon inside his electrical shop on the ground floor of the
apartment building and recounted the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the gun shots. I hid my wife and two children under a
table. There was shooting and screaming and confusion,'' he said.
``After the shooting, I came out and helped bring the wounded out.
There was blood everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For years everyone has talked about the women who were
involved _ a blonde and a brunette,'' said Muna, who said he was
hiding during the raid. ``But I never knew one of these men with
the wig was Barak. It surprised everyone here.'' A report in a
local paper was the first to publish the connection after Barak's
electoral victory in Israel on May 17.
</P>
<P>
   As Barak begins to build a coalition before being sworn in later
this month, Israeli observers said the success of his government
will depend on whether he can forge his military past into the
policies of peace and unity that he promised. They are big
promises. Barak has vowed to withdraw Israel's troops from its
self-proclaimed ``security zone'' in south Lebanon within one year
and to restart the long deadlocked peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Reports that he has chosen three top generals to head his
negotiating team have some analysts concerned that they will be
unlikely to take the bold steps necessary to break the impasse. But
other analysts indicated Barak and his generals can be trusted to
ensure Israeli security while negotiating withdrawal from Lebanon,
a deal with Syria over the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, and the
turnover of more land to the Palestinians under the 1993 Oslo peace
accords.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it is very clear that a person who had a personal
involvement and risk in an operation like the one in Beirut is much
more likely to have the guts and the courage to move forward to end
the conflict,'' said Avshalom Horan, who was a member of Barak's
commando unit on dozens of raids and served alongside him for more
than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can say that he doesn't understand the operations, or
he is removed from the reality on the ground,'' added Horan, now a
high-tech entrepreneur who remains a close friend to Barak and
played a role in his election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a love of the land and fighting for what you believe
is right'' that is ``required to storm a building like that,'' said
Horan, who was not involved in the raid but has discussed it many
times with Barak. ``These values mean a great deal in this region,
to both sides of the conflict. And that is why you find respect for
Barak on the street in Beirut and in Tel Aviv.''
</P>
<P>
   The raid catapulted Barak's military career.
</P>
<P>
   It became the stuff of military legend, and his account of the
incident is featured in a recently published biography under the
chapter heading ``Brunette in the Heart of Beirut.''
</P>
<P>
   The raid was described by Israeli press reports at the time and
by historians today as ``brave'' and ``daring,'' a crushing blow to
the most militant and murderous faction of the PLO.
</P>
<P>
   But Lebanese and Palestinian scribes described the raid as a
glaring example of the Israeli military flouting territorial
sovereignty and international law.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Najjar, the son of Abu Yussef, was 11 years old at the
time. He remembers waking to the gunshots and hearing the front
door of the family home explode off its hinges as six Israelis
stormed in. One commando held a gun to his head while he watched
through a crack in the door as his father was cut down by machine
gun fire. His mother, who tried to protect his father, was also
gunned down.
</P>
<P>
   His 16-year-old brother fled down a telephone pole in the back
of the apartment and spotted a commando in a brunette wig with a
machine gun who shot him twice in the arm. This, Najjar believes,
was Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tells you something about'' Barak's ``character, that he
went inside a home with women and children,'' said Najjar, who is
now the director of the Palestinian Authority's Ministry of
Economic Planning and lives in Gaza. ``The two sides were at war, I
accept that, but there were many opportunities to kill my father in
the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just a macho exercise for the Israelis. That Barak
led it, shows he's part of that macho mindset. I think the way he
was as a soldier will be the way he is as a politician.''
</P>
<P>
   Farouk Nassar, a Lebanese reporter for the Associated Press who
covered the story, found the PLO's Nasser lying on the floor in a
pool of blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bullets were fired into his mouth because he was the
spokesman,'' said Nassar, who later became AP bureau chief in
Beirut and is now retired. ``It was carried out with surgical
precision.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if a leader of such an operation could also pull the
troops out of Lebanon and end the last active war in the Middle
East, Nassar responded, ``Who would have believed that'' slain
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak ``Rabin would make peace and shake
hands with'' Palestinian leader Yasser ``Arafat. . . . Why
shouldn't Barak be in the same footsteps?''
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim Abouhjeili, 57, owns a barber shop on the Beirut street,
and he remembers arriving to open it that morning and seeing the
blood on the street and the chaos and confusion of the Lebanese
police and PLO bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since that incident, we've had 20 years of war, we've had
worse things happen. . . . People change after all those years,''
he said. ``I think Barak has changed. I think he wants Israeli
troops out of Lebanon, and I think he knows it's time for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Gathering around the barber shop, residents began sharing their
memories. The owner of the dry cleaner next door remembered the day
of the raid vividly, but refused to give his name to a reporter,
saying, ``Israel can still come here and kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   The man, in his early 40s, said he was confident Barak would
withdraw the troops and end the conflict in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fighter who goes into battle,'' he said, ``knows the meaning
of peace.''

THE HIDING OVER, COMMUNITY VENTURES FORTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DJAKOVICA, Kosovo _ Tahir Nikolici, like so many victims of the
war in Kosovo, was too weak to escape. The paralyzed 67-year-old
Nikolici was in his wheelchair, at home with his daughter on a
usually quiet, cobblestoned street here, when Serb paramilitary
fighters barged in on April 13 and demanded that everyone leave,
neighbors say.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolici couldn't move without help. His daughter pleaded with
the Serbs to allow her to take out her disabled father. They
refused, she said, and burned the house down with her father
inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was my neighbor. I knew him 50 years. And I buried him here
with my own hands,'' said Fatmir Gola, 61, gesturing to a fresh
mound of dirt in what used to be Nikolici's garden.
</P>
<P>
   The house is demolished, reduced to a pile of red roof tiles and
smashed bricks.
</P>
<P>
   The town of Djakovica was on the front line of the war, and it
looks it. The old section of town _ once a pretty neighborhood of
small cafes, boutiques, and a historic mosque _ is now row upon row
of blackened shells of buildings. Shops are all closed, and there
is little food available.
</P>
<P>
   Only a fraction of Djakovica's structures _ including the
Serbian Orthodox church, and some curtained, now-abandoned Serb
houses _ were left untouched by the killing and arson.
</P>
<P>
   Most houses are roofless, and what wasn't stolen was set afire.
The colorful, well-kept gardens, where old women chatted over thick
Turkish coffee and children played, have commonly become graveyards
for the war dead. Residents were too afraid to take the bodies to a
cemetery for a proper Muslim burial.
</P>
<P>
   After months of hiding in terror inside their houses, ethnic
Albanians came outside this week, some to meet for the first time
since the NATO bombs dropped in March and triggered what they
describe as a Serb siege of terror. Since their cars were stolen,
they have been pedaling around town on bicycles, assessing the
damage in horror.
</P>
<P>
   When they meet, they rush to embrace. They exchange tales of
terror and murder, and they all have the same questions.
</P>
<P>
   Have you seen my husband? Do you know what happened to my sons,
my uncle, my nephew?
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we find this out?'' asked an anguished Selemet Peni,
49. ``Everyone now is asking for their relatives, but who knows
where they are? Are they dead? Are they in prison? How can we even
get the information?''
</P>
<P>
   Local residents estimate that 1,200 people _ mainly young men _
are missing. Some are believed to be dead. No one knows how many.
</P>
<P>
   People here say the modus operandi of the Serbs was to kill
first, then burn. With the evidence often in ashes, it is
impossible to know for certain whether the missing residents of
Djakovica made it to refugee camps, starved in the mountains, were
taken to prison, or were killed and burned by the Serb military.
</P>
<P>
   Afijet Zhuja wants to know what happened to four of her male
neighbors, but she is afraid to find out.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb paramilitary forces came through her neighborhood on
April 9, she recalled, separating out the men and ordering the
women and children to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The house of the Grqari family was burned, and their neighbors
fear that the men _ the father, Sylemon Grqari, and his three sons
_ are still inside, murdered.
</P>
<P>
   On the rare occasions when ethnic Albanians ventured out to find
food, the Serb paramilitaries refused to allow them to walk down
the Grqari's street. But once the Serbs left Djakovica, Zhuja
stepped a few inches inside, then drew back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid of what I would see. I was afraid it is really
true,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She approached the Italian soldiers who make up part of the
peacekeeping Kosovo Force (KFOR), asking their help.
</P>
<P>
   They told her to avoid the house, as it may be booby-trapped. So
now Zhuja waits and wonders.
</P>
<P>
   No one can tell yet how many people escaped Djakovica, and how
many remained out of fear or force.
</P>
<P>
   What diplomats proclaimed as peace meant a final, rage-filled
spasm by the Serb military, who, locals said, stole cars, looted
houses, and burned others in the last days before Tuesday's
deadline for a full military withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   They burst into the back window of the Hasimja family's house on
Saturday, family members said, making physical threats and
demanding money and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   They put a gun into the mouth of a 25-year-old recent medical
school graduate, Delvina Hasimja, she said, and beat her father and
her uncle. Her blind grandmother cowered in fear as the
black-masked Serbs emptied the house of valuables.
</P>
<P>
   There was already another family staying in the house, since the
Serbs had burned the next door neighbor's house weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine that a human being can do that,'' said Delvina
Hasimja, sitting on a carpet in her nearly empty house.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the peace deal came down, they became very angry. They
burned houses, they killed people who were intellectuals,'' she
added. A fellow medical school graduate is missing, and Delvina
Hasimja fears he is dead.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Djakovica appears safe. The Serbs _ civilians as well
as militia _ have largely left, and the city is now patrolled by
KFOR and by uniformed, armed members of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
Both are cheered enthusiastically by people on the street.
</P>
<P>
   But with Djakovica largely in rubble and the whereabouts of many
of its men unknown, residents wonder what comes next.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we are figuring out how to survive and how to build our
future,'' Delvina Hasimja said. ``I had dreams of being a good
doctor. Now, I just want to be alive.''

   LAPLJE SELO, Yugoslavia _ Zika Jovovic is the land, and the land
is Zika Jovovic. That is why the 55-year-old Jovovic rises at 5
every morning to tend to his cattle, his chickens, his
strawberries, and his walnut trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This land means everything to him,'' said his 20-year-old son,
Andrija, as Jovovic showed a visitor the 250-year-old mill that is
powered by a stream that runs through the family farm. ``To leave
this land would be like a slow death to him.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the first time in four centuries, when the Jovovics
began living off these eight acres of rustic land in central
Kosovo, they are seriously considering leaving it. Their bags are
packed for a quick getaway, and every night, Zika Jovovic sits up,
listening for approaching cars.
</P>
<P>
   His great fear is that it will be the rebels of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, bent on exacting revenge for the atrocities
committed against ethnic Albanians by Serb forces. The Serb troops
have pulled out, the last in this area leaving Tuesday from the
local school they were using as a base. A young woman who watched
them pull out before Tuesday's deadline stood on the side of the
road, crying.
</P>
<P>
   The Jovovics' mill is a national heritage site, protected by the
government. The Jovovics, however, are not. Nor can they protect
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no weapons. All I could do is run for the car,'' Zika
Jovovic said, drawing hard on a Malboro. ``I didn't harm anyone. It
would be very unfair if someone slaughtered us.''
</P>
<P>
   Momcilo Trajkovic, leader of the Serbian Resistance Movement,
who is trying to persuade Serbs to stay in Kosovo, runs a farming
cooperative in Laplje Selo. It is the quintessential Serb village,
he says, and if the Serbs of Laplje Selo leave, there is no hope
for any of the 200,000 Serbs left in Kosovo. As Laplje Selo goes,
so go the Serbs in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Just five miles south of the capital of Pristina, Laplje Selo is
a rural village of 450 homes, all of them Serb. The 2,500 people
here have made a pact. Either they all stay, or they all go. So
far, they've stayed.
</P>
<P>
   The raging tug of war between Serbs and Albanians over Kosovo
largely bypassed Laplje Selo, mostly because there were so few
Albanians here. The last two Albanian homes were torched last year.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also no denying that many people here are gentler
than the bellicose Serbian nationalists who get most of the
attention. They do not speak about Albanians in racist terms.
</P>
<P>
   They measure the time in seasons, and when the women are
pregnant for the first time, as 20-year-old Zorica Petkovic is,
they pray for a boy, so there will be a male to inherit the land.
</P>
<P>
   Petkovic's husband, Vladimir, 25, took over the land when his
father died last year. He runs a gravestone workshop in front of
his home and grows crops out back.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family has been here for 400 years,'' Vladimir says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five hundred,'' his grandfather, 73-year-old Miladin Petkovic,
corrects him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't packed,'' Vladimir continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone will leave together, or stay together,'' his
78-year-old grandmother Jelica chimes in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not leaving,'' Vladimir says.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he knows that if KLA gunmen pound on his door, he would have
little choice but to load his grandparents and his pregnant wife
into a car and go.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, as the road north to Pristina was choked with
the overflowing cars and tractors of Serb refugees from Prizren,
the people of Laplje Selo came face to face with their possible
fate, and it chilled them to the bone. The convoy was just 100
yards from the Jovovic house. The Petkovics had a panoramic view of
the exodus from a quarter-mile away.
</P>
<P>
   Trajkovic says at least 30,000 Serbs have fled Kosovo. He said
it is a ``great irony'' that the ability of Serbs to remain in
Kosovo now rests in the hands of foreign troops.
</P>
<P>
   Trajkovic said that with Serb forces withdrawing, and the
government of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic effectively
ceding control of Kosovo to the international community, the fate
of Serbs in Kosovo rests with K-FOR peacekeeping troops.
</P>
<P>
   Here as in other isolated Serb villages, people say they hope
that K-FOR will protect them, but they are uneasy about the cozy
relationship between the KLA and NATO, whose soldiers account for
the bulk of K-FOR peacekeeping troops. They want to see more
evidence of NATO troops disarming and arresting KLA fighters.
</P>
<P>
   No one from the village has yet approached K-FOR troops to ask
for protection. Tuesday, for only the second time, British troops
drove through the village in a Warrior armored vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If K-FOR disarms the KLA, everything will be OK,'' said Zika
Jovovic. ``We used to live with ordinary Albanians. We don't need
weapons here. Most of the houses around here don't have weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, as in other Serb hamlets, perception is reality, and
perceptions are shaped by pieces of information gleaned from the
news, but mostly from the frightening rumors that spread faster
than any fungus on the locally grown produce. Some of the rumors
turn out to be true.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the family living across the street from the Jovovics
found out that one of their relatives was killed by the KLA when it
stormed a Serb apartment block in Pristina, shooting one man dead
and wounding another. K-FOR officials said British troops arrested
five suspected KLA members in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   There have been several kidnappings of Serbs by the KLA in
Pristina, and Zika Jovovic was so worried that he insisted on
accompanying his son to Pristina while Andrija took his music
composition exams Monday.

   ``Personally, I would be very pleased to see K-FOR troops
patrolling on my street,'' said Zika Jovovic. ``They have to
protect everybody, Albanians and Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, word came that the KLA was putting Serb families
out of the Sunny Hill section of Pristina. The last of the Serb
army units were heading out to meet the midnight deadline of
withdrawing from the Pristina area. Fear is spreading among Serbs,
as it spread among Albanians three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Jovovics have survived many wars on this land. A bullet
fired by Ottoman Turks is still lodged in the wooden door to the
mill. Zika Jovovic was born in 1943, as World War II raged. His
14-month-old grandson Nikola's first words, spoken last week, were
``plane, boom boom,'' a sound he learned as the family huddled in a
damp, musty basement through 78 days of NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Squinting in the sun, Zika Jovovic looked up and said, ``This is
my home. I don't want to leave it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the village, Vladimir Petkovic believes he
will be here in November, when his first child is born.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, people didn't believe the land would ever be free
of Turks. But it is. The same goes for today,'' he said. ``You have
to believe.''

MOVIE CHOICES: DUMB &AMP; DUMBER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   I don't embarrass easily, but I was grateful for the dim
lighting in the theater the other night while watching ``Austin
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.''
</P>
<P>
   All around me, pre-pubescent boys were snickering at the bosomy
babes, howling at the bathroom jokes, and elbowing each other
during the bedroom scenes. Two of them were my sons, sneaking a
sidelong glance now and then to see if a less-than-subtle sexual
innuendo had eluded Mom.
</P>
<P>
   New Line Cinema released this sequel to Mike Meyers's 1997
sendup of '60s pop culture the same week President Clinton urged
theater owners to card teenagers to thwart the under-17 set from
sneaking into R-rated movies. If the president thinks troublesome
content is limited to movies with R ratings, if he thinks the
rating system itself is anything other than a sham, then it has
been too long since he visited his neighborhood multiplex.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Clinton last week led one to wonder whether the White
House is hermetically sealed after he ordered the Federal Trade
Commission to investigate ``whether and how video game, motion
picture, and recording industries market to children violent and
other material rated for adults.''
</P>
<P>
   He needs a federal inquiry to determine the obvious?
</P>
<P>
   A trip to the mall should have sufficed. In the window of the
Warner Brothers Store, promotions for ``Austin Powers'' _ the
PG-13-rated adventures of a time-traveling, libidinous spy _ sit
alongside the Tweety Bird and Bugs Bunny merchandise. As best I can
figure, Hollywood rates the movie as relatively inoffensive because
its raunchiness is only a spoof of really raunchy movies.
</P>
<P>
   There's a logic there. Somewhere. The problem is not just
``Austin Powers.'' Mike Meyers, like Jim Carrey, is a comedic
talent. He has a clown's gift for mannerism and physical comedy.
But watching ``Austin Powers'' was a little like imagining Jerry
Lewis overdosing on Viagra _ what begins as naughty but nice
descends rapidly into crude and lewd.
</P>
<P>
   Adults respond to ``Austin Powers'' in much the way parents
respond to ``Sesame Street.'' The writers for ``Sesame Street''
always work on two levels, one aimed at preschoolers, the other at
the parents in the playroom with them. ``Austin Powers'' works that
way, too, with a subtext that appeals to adults and an earthiness
that appeals to kids. My sons missed the sendups of old movies, but
they roared (and I cringed) when the fembot's nipples sprouted gun
barrels. The gerbil joke sailed right passed them, but they hooted
(and I groaned) when the fat bagpiper passed gas.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not that Hollywood is awash in cultural
pollution. It is that it is steeped in corporate greed. ``Austin
Powers'' broke box office records for a comedy its first weekend
because it exploits a winning formula with the middle school crowd
(See ``Ace Ventura: Pet Detective'' and ``Dumb and Dumber.'')
</P>
<P>
   No one _ except perhaps William Bennett _ wants to ban
sophomoric humor from the silver screen. It would just be
refreshing to have the movie industry stop urging parents to steer
their kids away from inappropriate material and to acknowledge that
not much else is out there for young people who are beyond the
Disney cartoon stage. The phrase ``parental guidance'' is
meaningless when Hollywood offers so few alternatives to the
formulaic scripts now aimed at teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that even as moviemakers pander to the lowest
common denominator, more and better fiction is being written for
young adults. Instead of the novels of Sharon Creech or Edward
Bloor or Lois Lowery, Hollywood gives us ``I Know What You Did Last
Summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Political initiatives to protect children from violent or
sexually explicit movies mirror the halfway measures that would
deny them access to lethal weapons. Stationing a police officer
outside every movie theater will stop teenagers from seeing R-rated
movies about as well as stationing security guards in the halls
will stop high school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   If Bill Clinton really wants to challenge the Hollywood movie
moguls whose profits have lined his campaign coffers all these
years, he ought to demand that his friends give our childen the
quality films they deserve.
</P>
<P>
   We don't need more culture cops. We need more consumer choice.

RAISE THE AGE ON BUYING GUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the inexplicable debates in the insensate debacle on guns
is whether the minimum age for handgun possession should go from 18
to 21. There would be no debate if one remembered 1984.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, the political movement against drunken driving forced
the conservative President Ronald Reagan to sign a bill that
threatened states with the loss of federal highway funds if they
did not raise the minimum drinking age to 21.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan, who earlier opposed the bill, said in his Rose Garden
signing ceremony that it was ``a simple measure that will save
thousands of young lives.'' Reagan, who led the GOP assault on big
government, said that drunk driving was ``bigger than the
individual states.'' He said, ``With the problem so clear-cut and
the prudent solution at hand, we have no misgivings about this
judicious use of federal power.''
</P>
<P>
   The statistics behind Reagan's change of heart were undeniable,
even for a conservative. Several states where the legal age had
already been raised to 21 had seen sharp declines in fatal car
crashes. One such state was New Jersey. Tom Kean, then the governor
and a Republican, said, ``When people are going to be killed, when
people are going to be maimed, when people are going to be ruined
for life, then states' rights or any other abstraction is not going
to stand in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Reagan's pen saved lives. In 1994, the Centers for Disease
Control found that alcohol-related traffic fatalities dropped from
25,165 in 1982 to 17,461 in 1993. Fatalities suffered by people
aged 15 to 20 dropped 59 percent between 1982 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC has attributed the drops to a wide range of factors,
society's disdain for intoxicated driving, tougher enforcement of
laws, greater use of safety belts, overall decreased alcohol
consumption, and raising the minimum drinking age to 21.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence was so convincing that in 1994, when Governor
William Weld of Massachusetts signed a law that banned handgun
possession for people under 21 in Boston, his analogy was alcohol.
``That's an easy issue, because if you raise that age to 21, it
will be like drinking,'' said Weld, who was hardly antigun, being a
hunter who owns several rifles. ``You'll make it harder for the
kids 13, 14, 15 16 to get a handgun, and they're the ones who have
them now.''
</P>
<P>
   By coincidence, a year after Weld signed the law, Boston,
riddled with youth murders in the early 1990s, began a
two-and-a-half-year spell without a gun murder of a child under 17.
</P>
<P>
   Little of that history has informed the debate on guns on
Capitol Hill. Current law forbids the sale of handguns from
federaly licensed dealers to people under 21. But the law does not
cover private sales or gun shows. Several of the handguns and
rifles used by teenagers in the nation's schoolyard shootings were
purchased at licensed gun stores or gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   When the Senate passed its mild proposal to restrict gun sales,
there was no mention of raising the limit on handgun possession
from 18 to 21. In the House, there is such a proposal, but nothing
close to a consensus.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton wants to raise the age for buying and
possession of handguns. But the National Rifle Association, which
has sprung back to life after Littleton forced it into a momentary
crouch, has placed its heavy hand on Congress. Republican House
majority leader Dennis Hastert supports raising the age for
purchase but not for possession. Many Republicans and some
Democrats still opposes any rise in the minimum age.
</P>
<P>
   New evidence should end the debate. The Treasury and Justice
Departments this week released a study that found that 18 to 20
year olds, 4 percent of the population, account for 24 percent of
gun murders in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Vice President Al Gore, Justice Deputy Attorney
General Eric Holder and Treasury Undersecretary James Johnson
called for a ban on handgun and assault rifle possession and sales
to people under 21. Holder and Johnson said they found that over 40
percent of crime guns recovered by police from 18 to 20 year olds
had been purchased within the last three years from a licensed gun
dealer. Most of those guns were handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If possession of and access to firearms among this age group
are reduced, deaths from armed crime will likely be reduced,''
Holder and Johnson wrote. ``It is also reasonable to expect that by
reducing access to firearms by this age group, it will also make it
more difficult for their younger siblings, classmates, and friends
to obtain guns illegally, reducing gun violence among juveniles
under 18.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the reasoning Reagan was forced to use in raising the
drinking age. That is the logic that Weld used to sign the handgun
ban in Boston. To borrow from Reagan and Kean, the problem of guns
is clear-cut. The prudent solution at hand.
</P>
<P>
   This is about people being killed, maimed, and ruined for life.
The National Rifle Association should not stand in the way.
Congress should have no misgivings about its judicious use of
federal power. Its hesitation to raise the handgun age to 21 is not
only inexplicable and insensate. It is unconscionable.

GRASS-ROOTS CAMPAIGN TACKLES WEALTH GAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A rising tide lifts all boats. So goes the cliche.
</P>
<P>
   But that's certainly not been the case during the current
economic good times that have fed an explosion of sales of
big-ticket items, from bigger sport-utility vehicles to $200 meals
at fancy French bistros.
</P>
<P>
   While these have been flush years for the wealthy, those at the
bottom of the financial ladder have not only been left out of the
economic surge _ they've actually fallen several rungs.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one solid piece of circumstantial piece: In the 1970s,
the richest 10 percent of the American population controlled 50
percent of the wealth, while the rest of the population divided the
remaining 50 percent, according to U.S. government data.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly the most equitable economic picture, but far better
than what's happened in the ensuing 20 years. During the 1990s, the
percentage of wealth enjoyed by the richest 10 percent has climbed
to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It is this kind of skewed distribution of wealth that is
mobilizing a growing grass-roots campaign to find ways _ by raising
the minimum wage, revamping the tax code, among others _ to create
a more equitable economic system.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend at Boston College, United for a Fair Economy, a
national group based in Boston, hosted a conference designed to
enlist religious congregations _ natural allies, perhaps, given
their moral underpinnings _ in this expanding campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great and wondrous economy,'' said Chuck Collins,
codirector of United for Fair Economy. ``There are some really good
things happening, with low unemployment and exploding stock
portfolios. And if we can't address issues of poverty and
inequality in this economy, when will we? When two big growth
industries in this country are prisons and gated communities, you
have to ask if this really is the kind of economy we want to
create.''
</P>
<P>
   Religious leaders worldwide recently have begun to sound the
alarm bell over the widening gap between rich and poor not only in
the United States, but around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II, the Dalai Lama and the World Council of
Churches have called for international lending institutions,
including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, to
cancel the unpayable debt _ estimated at as much as $300 billion _
of developing countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Burdened by massive loan repayments, many countries have slashed
spending on education, health care and welfare, exacerbating the
already bleak outlook for their poorest populations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The millennium should be something more meaningful than
worrying about our computers and popping champagne corks,'' said
David Bryden, communications and outreach coordinator for Jubilee
2000/USA, a Washington-based group advocating debt forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul has declared next year, the 2,000th anniversary of the
birth of Jesus, a jubilee year and a cause for religious
celebration. But in biblical terms jubilee has a special resonance.
In the book of Leviticus, God instructs the Israelites to celebrate
a jubilee every 50 years by, among other steps, forgiving debts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Roman Catholic Church speaks very clearly on social
justice,'' said Charles Derber, a sociology professor at Boston
College and one of the speakers at this weekend's conference.
``There is a really well-articulated and well-reasoned discussion
of human decency and dignity. These aren't just whimsical
ideological statements. They have concrete implications, if you
take them serious, for the organization of economic systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the conference hope to motivate more religious
congregations to become involved in issues of economic equity by
lobbying Congress members and incorporating themes of the gap
between rich and poor into worship services and religious education
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economists have become secular priests who dictate economic
arrangements in a way that is not senstive to the values of most
religious folks,'' Derber said. ``They have managed to persuade
most Americans that a wide division between rich and poor is the
price that has to be paid for having a prosperous economy. . . . We
have to challenge that theology.''

   Those are the fighting men from the mountain kingdom of Nepal,
whose male antecedents have served in the British Army for 180
years. You'll know them by their short and sturdy stature, their

   Recruited as teenage boys by British officers, the hardy hillmen
and herdsmen of the Nepalese mountains east of Katmandu have left
their mark on foes from the Falklands to Burma. So it was not by
chance that General Michael Jackson, the NATO commander of the
Kosovo liberation force, selected 660 men from the 1st Battalion,
Royal Gurkha Rifles, to join 1,400 British paratroopers for the
initial NATO push into the embattled province.
</P>
<P>
   The infantryman's role is the hardest job in combat. The man on
the ground with a rifle and a bayonet is the ultimate ``sharp end
of the stick,'' in the laconic British diplomatic phrase for what
happens after push has come to shove. When the sharp end of the
stick includes skilled skirmishers packing whetted kukris, Serb
bullyboys had best beware.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs had their way with the unarmed farmers and townsmen of
Kosovo, separating out and from time to time killing the men,
raping women, brutalizing the old, robbing and destroying with
impunity, fearing only retaliation from 15,000 feet up.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's a new game on the ground as well as in the skies.
</P>
<P>
   The audacious move of 200 Serb-sympathizing Russians into
Pristina's airport was a nasty and embarrassing surprise for NATO.
The gambit may not look so funny in January if the West can't seem
to find the paperwork for the next $4 billion transfer of cash to
the wobbly Russian economy. But Battlin' Boris and the Krazy Kops
running the Kremlin can't seem to think beyond next week. When our
Russian friends run short of World Bank credits this winter,
someone may idly mention the sneaky end run into the Pristina
airport.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Russians playing roulette with their Slavic soul
brothers, the Serbs, the tide is now running with the West. A
Chicago Tribune correspondent with NATO forces in Kosovo Saturday
reported:
</P>
<P>
   ``Some NATO troops did more than just move Saturday. Gurkha
soldiers stopped private vehicles in which Serb police were
traveling. They searched the cars, searched the men and, while
cameras rolled, relieved the police of their weapons. Among the
guns confiscated were pistols, Kalashnikov rifles, and Thompson
submachine guns. Asked whether the police had put up a fuss, a
typically reticent Ghurka responded, `Not a worry.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A Dallas Morning News account described Gurkha riflemen ``who
defused land mines found along Route Hawk, the main road into the
province.'' A Gurkha patrol ``moving north had run into a column of
Yugoslav army trucks that wanted to move south to retrieve
equipment hidden in the woods. The Gurkhas, under orders not to let
armed men down the road, blocked the way with three combat
reconnaissance vehicles.'' That incident ended without gunplay.
</P>
<P>
   There will be hundreds of similar encounters as Kosovo gives
over military control from Serbs loyal to Milosevic to NATO forces.
Having the discipline not to shoot, not to be provoked, is what
separates the NATO forces from the Serbs, who had things all their
own way till the first NATO strike signaled the beginning of the
end.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting wars thousands of miles from their homeland is what
sets Gurkhas apart. For details of this century's efforts, see
``History of 7th Duke of Edinburgh's Own Gurkha Rifles,'' by Col.
J.N. MacKay (Wm. Blackwood &AMP; Sons, 1962) and ``East of Katmandu,''
by E.D. Smith, (Leo Cooper, 1976).
</P>
<P>
   Sir Ralph Turner, a Cambridge professor of Sanskrit and a Gurkha
officer, memorialized these ``stubborn and indomitable peasants of
Nepal. Once more I hear the laughter with which you greeted every
hardship. I see you in your bivouacs, shivering with wet and cold,
now scorched by pitiless and burning sun. Uncomplaining, you endure
hunger and thirst and wounds; and at the last your unwavering lines
disappear into the smoke and wrath of battle. Bravest of the brave,
most generous of the generous, never had a country more faithful
friends than you.'' Faithful friends, but pitiless foes.
</P>
<P>
   So, a word to the wise among Serb gunslingers swaggering around
Kosovo: Before the Gurkhas arrive and set up their tents, before
they start patrolling and looking out for troublemakers, point your
nose in the direction of Belgrade and set off smartly in that
direction. Because the quiet soldier who comes to work with jungle
hat and kukri tucked in his belt is not a man to mess with.

MR. FUSSY GOES TO THE BOOKSTORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (With apologies to the late Roger Hargreaves, creator of Mr.
Fussy, Mr. Nonsense, and 42 other delightful children's book
characters.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Fussy's family has sent him to the bookstore to buy a
Father's Day present for himself. Mr. Fussy would rather not have a
Father's Day present. All things being equal, Mr. Fussy would
rather not have Father's Day, when everyone tries to make him
``happy.'' If they wanted him to be happy, they would do away with
these ridiculous ``days.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming to the bookstore was a mistake. Perhaps he should have
settled for a necktie. Or for one of those Brookstone barbecue
forks that tell you the temperature of what you are grilling. Vice
President Al Gore would like one of those. Last year, Mr. Fussy
heard the vice president deliver a stirring July Fourth address on
the importance of grilling red meat to over 160 degrees. Mr. F.
felt his vote sway GOP-ward inside him.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Fussy likes to read, but he is very fussy about books. Most
fathers must be less fussy than he, judging by the many special
shelves replete with Father's Day offerings: books about golf and
barbecuing, two activities Mr. F. cannot abide. Then there were the
usual Grishams and Clancys _ booksellers talk about them as if they
were deli items, like ``turkey'' and ``Swiss'' _ and tales of
Arthurian valor from our not-so-distant past, most of them
springing from the pen of literary Stakhanovite Stephen Ambrose.
</P>
<P>
   How to choose? Mr. Fussy has his own rules for books. Size
matters. Mr. Fussy likes his books the way he likes his voice mail
messages: brief, cogent, and to the point. Twenty seconds into a
voice mail screed, Mr. Fussy puts down the receiver and waits for
the dial tone. He likes short books, the way he likes short
parties. ``Bring the wine, leave by nine,'' he used to tell his
dinner guests. Now that he lives in what passes for polite society,
Mr. Fussy has to keep his feelings about hospitality to himself.
</P>
<P>
   But don't you love a good, short book? Michael Cunningham's
``The Hours,'' 230 pages _ perfect! Dava Sobel's ``Longitude,'' 184
pages _ bingo! The short list could go on and on. They say there
are books so good you never want them to end, although none comes
readily to mind. (The best book ever written, Cecil Woodham-Smith's
``The Reason Why,'' is only 292 pages long.) Locked in short-term
memory is Mr. Fussy's recent slog through Tom Wolfe's ``A Man in
Full,'' which seemed more like assigned reading than fun.
</P>
<P>
   Rule Number Two: Always judge a book by its cover. The most
beautiful book cover Mr. Fussy ever saw was the lovely illustration
for Michael Dorris's ``A Yellow Raft in Blue Water.'' Nowadays,
booksellers seem anxious to cloak their covers in a luxuriant
cerulean color (see Charles Frazier's ``Cold Mountain'' or Chris
Bohjalian's ``Midwives'') that Mr. Fussy calls ``selling blue.''
That Mr. Fussy has neither bought nor read any of these three books
undermines his credibility on this point.
</P>
<P>
   In principle. Mr. Fussy wants to read only good books. Some
people will read only books that have survived for over a century.
But then Mr. Fussy would have to read Walter Scott and ignore
Robertson Davies; what's the point of that? And of course, it all
depends what one means by good books.
</P>
<P>
   Do you mean good-good books, like Paul Auster's ``Mr. Vertigo''?
Or good-bad books, like the gossipy Hollywood tripe that Mr. Fussy
devours? Examples given: Charles Fleming's impossibly awful ``High
Concept,'' or the superb Nancy Griffin-Kim Masters expose of
Columbia Pictures, ``Hit and Run.'' A good-bad book is one that has
no redeeming social value, but is fun to read. Then there are
bad-bad books, which are gruesomely written and hell to read.
That's where Messrs. Clancy and Ludlum come in.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are good books with bad elements, like the Louis
Begley novels, ``The Man Who Was Late'' and ``About Schmidt.''
These are engaging and beautifully written, but reveal the author
to be a dirty old man. Put another way, Begley gets a lot right,
but he gets sex wrong. He should talk to Diane Johnson, author of
``Le Divorce.'' She gets sex right. How does Mr. Fussy know? He'd
rather not say, but he knows.

 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- She ran away from a civil war, but she couldn't flee
the war raging in her mind. She was haunted by the memories _
images of her baby boy suffocating, flashes of men violating her
day and night, recollections of torture and sexual abuse. She lost
all of her documents, but she carried her history with her, from
Liberia to Sierra Leone to Canada to the United States. As time
passed, she kept her story bottled up, shackled by its weight.
</P>
<P>
   But after years of guilt and shame and suicidal thoughts, she
found a safe place to heal at the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center;
she let her story spill out and began to recover. And now she's
telling her tale publicly so survivors of other wars might be
inspired to seek help. She's seen the footage from Kosovo, heard
the stories of violence against women. She is testifying now to
give women from Kosovo a window of hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back, I think I would be dead now if I hadn't found
the (rape crisis) center,''she says quietly. ``The only reason I
decided to tell you this story is because there might be one or two
people out there who have been through what I've been through.''
</P>
<P>
   She asks only that her first name be used. It's Patience _ and
she knows only too well that healing takes time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born in Cameroon,'' she begins, composing her thoughts
slowly yet calmly. She explains that she became politically active
as a high school student in the early '80s; Cameroon is bilingual
and students protested when the government mandated that school be
taught in French rather than English. She was arrested twice and
was whipped and tortured in jail.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of that upheaval, she met a Liberian soldier who
asked her to marry him. Her family objected to the match, but she
listened to her heart and followed him to Liberia in 1986. Back in
Cameroon, her parents disowned her, throwing her belongings in the
public cemetery to signify her death.
</P>
<P>
   That symbolic death was just the beginning. She moved to
Monrovia with her new husband, an elite soldier from the Krahn
tribe who served in the regime of President Samuel Doe. She
desperately wanted children, but had trouble conceiving for several
years. After one ectopic pregnancy, she finally gave birth to a son
in 1989; the couple named him Julius Doe, after the president.
</P>
<P>
   But Doe was overthrown and killed by the rival Manu tribe in
1990, igniting a civil war that left about 200,000 dead and sent
half of the country's 2.5 million people into exile. Patience, now
32, is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   One night when her son was about 3, her husband told her to pack
food and documents and said he was sending a friend to usher his
family out of the country to escape rebel Manu soldiers, who
controlled the area. ``The guy never came,'' she recalls. ``We
could hear firing and gunshots everywhere, so I locked up the house
and hid under the bed. In the early hours of the morning, I
realized the whole house was filled with smoke. We were trying to
go out the door when someone broke in. There were soldiers
everywhere. One of the officers asked me where my husband was, and
I told him I didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers tied up Patience and her son and threw them in the
back of a truck. But young J. D. was screaming, so the officers
gagged the prisoners with dirty newspaper and duct tape. As the
truck drove through a forest, Patience noticed that her son was
gasping for air; his nose was covered with tape. ``He was really
struggling to breathe and I was kicking the side of the truck,''
she recalls. ``I couldn't really help him. My hands and feet were
tied, and I was rubbing my jaw against his jaw. I tried and tried,
but he was getting weaker and weaker. He looked at me and then
closed his eyes and opened them again. He just became limp. I
looked at him and I realized he was dying, so I hit the truck
really hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The truck screeched to a halt. ``An officer came out and felt my
son's chest. He said, `Oh, he died,' and pulled him out of the
truck. I just realized he was going to dump him at the side of the
road, and I tried to make some kind of action to stop him. But he
just kind of dumped him and then the truck started moving.'' Her
voice is cool, almost detached, and the room is quiet. Suddenly, a
breeze blows through a window and the door slams shut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like you bring somebody into this world, and they're in
trouble and you cannot help them,'' she says. ``It's so painful.
Why did I have this child if I cannot help him?''
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers took her to an enclave where they whipped her and
tried to get her to talk about her husband. ``At that point, I
really wanted to die. I told them to just kill me.'' Instead, they
put her in a corner and, over the next few days, raped her
repeatedly. ``It was like I didn't own myself anymore,'' Patience
says. ``I was just there for anyone to rape me.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the commanding officer ordered a soldier to kill her,
but he refused. Another soldier took her into the forest and asked
her to escort his four children out of Liberia into Sierra Leone.
``I said, `No, just kill me.' I refused and refused and refused
until finally I said OK.'' A pause. ``I was numb and I didn't have
any feelings. A soldier who had killed my own child was asking me
to help his children. But he didn't use force to make me do it, and
that's why I said yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The man took Patience to his home where his mother nursed her
for about a week and half. Then she walked through the forest with

crossed the Mano River into Sierra Leone, where they met some
United Nations officials who took them to a refugee camp.

   The story of a woman named Patience speaks for thousands of
women who have been silenced for centuries. ``Rape is one of the
oldest weapons of war,'' says Charlene Allen, executive director of
the Boston rape crisis center. It is only in the last six years,
however, that the international community recognized rape as a
crime against humanity and that US immigration policy accepted rape
as grounds for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until five years ago there was very little that happened
with regard to women,'' says Nancy Kelly, an attorney with Greater
Boston Legal Services and the Women Refugees Project. ``They were
virtually invisible.''
</P>
<P>
   That began to change in 1993, when the United Nations sent a
team to investigate rape in Bosnia and the UN Commission on Human
Rights passed a resolution defining rape as a war crime. That same
year, the US Board of Immigration Appeals granted political asylum
to a woman who had been raped by armed men in Haiti during the
political coup. ``It is hard to believe, but there was no precedent
that said that rape inflicted because of a woman's political
opinions was persecution,'' says Kelly.

<P>
   The Haiti decision was published in 1995, setting a precedent
for immigration law. Soon after, the Immigration and Naturalization
Service issued a set of gender guidelines, establishing sexual
abuse as a form of persecution.
</P>
<P>
   But despite these changes, sexual violence is still extremely
difficult to document in war situations because of the stigma and
shame. In a new study, the Boston-based Physicians for Human Rights
documented only a handful of rape victims out of 1,180 Kosovar
refugees interviewed in Albania and Macedonia. ``There are a number
of reasons why this may be underrepresented,'' says Dr. Vincent
Iacopino, senior medical consultant for the group and leader of the
survey. ``We know that there is a severe social stigma, and that
they are viewed as unmarriable. There is pain and shame. I spoke to
one woman who told me if this had happened to her, she wouldn't be
speaking to me. She would have killed herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Iacopino stresses the battery of abuse against ethnic Albanians
in Kosovo, rather than singling out rape. ``But if it happens once,
it's a serious problem,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   There are few, if any, rape-specific services in the refugee
camps, where privacy is impossible and basic human needs like food
and shelter take precedence. Staff workers from the Boston Area
Rape Crisis Center left Tuesday for a conference in Vienna, where
they will train aid workers in rape counseling skills. ``One of the
things that leads to stability is getting control back,'' says
Allen. ``How can you get control in other issues in your life and
maybe never even talk about the rape? (Counseling skills) can
absolutely make a difference even in the immediate aftermath.''
</P>
<P>
   Patience says she didn't meet any rape counselors in the Sierra
Leone refugee camp, but she doesn't think she was ready to talk
then anyway. ``Healing happens when it happens,'' says Allen. ``But
we're trying to demystify the crime. Whatever we can do to help
people understand that this is a common occurrence in the context
of war will help people come forward when they're ready. They can
get support. They can get control.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It took Patience several years to seek help. ``I was running
away from a war and I didn't want to talk about it,'' she says. In
Sierra Leone, she bribed her way into joining an entourage headed
for a training seminar in Montreal. There, she was befriended by a
Jamaican woman in a traveling carnival who snuck her on a bus bound
for New York. From there, she stayed briefly with a relative in
Oklahoma before joining her brother in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But it took her three years to seek help. She stayed away from
men and small children, who reminded her of her son. She didn't
leave her brother's home. ``I slept for hours and hours and
hours,'' she says of those empty days. ``I didn't go to church. I
didn't go the market. I didn't go anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Her brother provided emotional support, but he died in a traffic
accident in July 1997. His death almost destroyed her. ``He was
everything to me, and I just wanted to kill myself,'' she says. She
planned her own death twice, even wrote a note. ``I bought this
chemical that said fatally harmful or harmfully fatal,'' she
recalls. ``I knew if I would drink it I would die. I kept looking
at it, but then I got up one day and poured it down the sink. It's
like I had this war in me. I'm a Christian and I thought, `What
will I say to God when I meet him? That I killed myself?' When you
get to the bottom, the lowest point, something comes up and you
keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends pulled her through. A rape survivor from Liberia
encouraged her to take charge of her life. She met Tony, a gentle
man from Ghana she plans to marry when her divorce to her husband
in Liberia is finalized. She first walked into the rape crisis
center about a year and a half ago. Today, she has gotten over her
phobia of small children; she even adopted a little girl, Tony's
niece, and named her Alberta, after her brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even now, I'm scared of being alone,'' she says. ``I live on a
busy, busy street with lots of people around. I can't take the
quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   She wants to stay on that street permanently. In February, she
requested asylum from the Immigration and Naturalization Service;
her request was denied because of a problem with her documents,
which she had paid a friend to obtain for her in Liberia. She will
plead her case to an immigration judge in November. ``Of the 50 or
60 asylum cases I've done, hers is the most compelling story I have
ever heard,'' says her attorney, Randy Feldman.
</P>
<P>
   Patience now works as a counselor for the mentally ill, and she
prays for her daughter's future. She says she could never return to
Liberia _ ``I wouldn't be a good citizen, let's put it that way.''
And although she has reconciled with her family in Cameroon, there
is no life for her there. ``No man would want me,'' she says.
``It's like you have a taboo attached to you. You become `that girl
who went to Liberia and got raped.' ''
</P>
<P>
   She's still afraid of being alone; she hasn't completely erased
the images and pain. Someone recently told her that after her long
struggle, she must have some purpose in life: There is a reason she
survived. ``Maybe God has a plan for me,'' she says. ``That's why I
decided to tell this story. Maybe one or two women will read this
at their lowest point. Maybe those people will think, `Well, this
woman made it. How about me?' ''

<P>
   BELFAST, Maine _ There's a story Desmond FitzGerald likes to
tell about the early years of Ducktrap River Fish Farm. It's a tale
about a dowser, a ``water witch'' who uses a divining rod to seek
out underground water, and FitzGerald begins it slowly, easing
himself deeper into his chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``His name was Edgar Libby,'' he says. ``He was 75 at the
time.'' It was 1977, and FitzGerald had called Libby because he
needed more water for his trout farm, then located along Kendall
Brook, a tributary of the Ducktrap River, in Lincolnville, about 7
miles from where the farm is now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pulled up in his Buick Electra and took out a wooden case
lined with velvet. He had a stainless steel divining rod,''
because, he told FitzGerald, the more traditional applewood
``shatters in my hand.''
</P>
<P>
   With the rod, Libby used a chain with a silver pendant, which
circled madly over one spot on the ground. The dowser declared that
FitzGerald would find water there, 150 feet down. FitzGerald had it
drilled, and there was water _ just below 150 feet. Tons of water
gushed out of the 6-inch hole with such force that it reminded
FitzGerald of an old Texas oil-well movie.
</P>
<P>
   Luck, mystery, and a deep connection with the land: The moment
has all the elements that FitzGerald focuses on when he's talking
about Ducktrap River Fish Farm. FitzGerald is self-deprecating in a
way that only someone with real confidence can be. His explanation
of how a small trout farm grew to a $19 million fish-smoking
business is this: ``I wouldn't discount luck.''
</P>
<P>
   The people he supplies would disagree.
</P>
<P>
   He worked and reworked his salmon, they say, then personally
delivered samples around the country. Every Ritz-Carlton hotel menu
in the country offers salmon that Ducktrap smokes exclusively for
Foley Fish Co. of Boston and New Bedford. Owner Michael Foley says
FitzGerald ``had a belief that there's a better product to be made.
And he delivered.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a good company,'' agrees Stephanie Stathe, seafood
coordinator of Bread &AMP; Circus, whose stores have been selling
Ducktrap products for 17 years. Whole Foods, the parent company of
Bread &AMP; Circus, packages Ducktrap smoked salmon under a Whole Foods
house label for national distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Though it began as a farm, Ducktrap is now exclusively a smoking
operation. Its trout comes from Idaho; its mackerel for the popular
smoked-peppered mackerel fillets is flown in from the Shetland
Islands, off the coast of Scotland. Plump mussels come from local
waters (``blue mussels from Maine are the best in the world,'' says
FitzGerald), and succulent cold-water shrimp the size of a pinkie
are fished in Maine, too. White sturgeon from Oregon goes into the
smokers, along with loins of yellowfin tuna from the Pacific.
Ducktrap's smoked trout pate is widely imitated, and among the
latest of the 35 products is smoke-roasted salmon in individual
packages, intended for the microwave and ready for the table in
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the early years, when FitzGerald was trying to raise fish,
his half-sister Frances ``Frankie'' FitzGerald, the Pulitzer
Prize-winning author of ``Fire in the Lake: The Vietnamese and the
Americans in Vietnam,'' came up from Manhattan to visit him. ``This
is absolutely the end of the earth,'' she declared.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all a matter of where you live,'' he answered.
</P>
<P>
   FitzGerald, 47, lives in Maine _ as he has for 20 years. He
wandered up here armed simply with a love of marine biology, a
Harvard degree (class of '74), and a crash course in aquaculture
that he laughingly calls ``Berlitz fish.'' He came for the
lifestyle, he says, and though he has replaced the romantic days of
a rural Maine trout farmer with the hectic schedule of a CEO in a
24-hour plant, the role seems to suit him.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Ducktrap became too big for FitzGerald to
continue pumping money into _ especially, as he says, with four
children ``edging in on boarding school and college.'' So he gave
up his controlling interest in exchange for corporate backing.
Earlier this spring, Ducktrap and its salmon supplier of eight
years, Atlantic Salmon of Maine, formed a holding company,
ContiSea, of which FitzGerald is CEO. The state-of-the-art Belfast
plant has just been renovated to accommodate Atlantic Salmon's
offices, make separate areas for raw fish and smoked seafood (for
sanitation reasons), and expand freezing and cooling areas.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies are part of ContiGroup, formerly Continental
Grain Co. By having his company acquired, FitzGerald thought he was
getting rid of all his financial headaches, but it turns out not to
be quite that simple. ``You can't walk up to the candy man and ask
for money,'' he says. ContiGroup didn't, for instance, sign the
lending agreement for the new facility.
</P>
<P>
   As he explains this, he has one eye on a construction crew about
to dig up some young trees outside his office window. It's so
painful to watch, he has to jump up from his chair and close the
blinds.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company remains essentially the same. ``If you asked
anyone here what has changed, they might say, `Well, Des is in a
better mood.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Desmond FitzGerald and his wife, Lucinda Ziesing, an actress,
live in Camden with four children, ages 5 to 14. When they married,
he says, the wedding announcement in The New York Times was
headlined, ``Fish farmer marries actress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a kick out of that.''
</P>
<P>
   FitzGerald grew up in the fashionable Georgetown section of
Washington, D.C., and attended Potomac School and St. Mark's in
Southborough before Harvard, where he majored in biology. His
father, for whom he was named, was deputy director of the Central
Intelligence Agency. The family connections could have opened
doors, no doubt, but after college, FitzGerald lit out for Alaska,
where he had been a number of times.
</P>
<P>
   On the way, in 1975, he met Richard Mack, who owned a trout
farm. Aquaculture fascinated FitzGerald, so he enrolled at the
University of Washington's College of Fisheries for his crash
course in fish farming. ``I didn't get a degree, I just
cherry-picked graduate courses,'' he says. Soon after, he headed
for Maine. He had summered on Mount Desert Island and had ``fond
childhood memories of Maine,'' he says. ``I moved to Maine as a
lifestyle choice, not to make money. I was more interested in
escaping the city and being in a rural area.''

 BELFAST, Maine: ... a rural area.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The move, not to mention the trout farm he planned, took his
family by surprise. ``This is certainly not what my father expected
me to do,'' FitzGerald says. And Belfast, the town he chose, was
hardly a resort like Mount Desert.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of those charming Maine seacoast towns, east of Augusta
and south of Bangor, where 19th-century white clapboard houses line
the small roads, and restaurants like the Clam Hut announce,
``Today's special: Clams.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a manufacturing town gone fallow,'' explains Dusty
Batley, Ducktrap's production manager. The chicken processors who
thrived here 25 years ago are gone; so are the shoe manufacturers.
To Batley, who joined Ducktrap 15 years ago, that meant ``high
unemployment among people who understand the production world.'' He
hired 150 employees, who work with such precision that they know
there are 28 pin bones to pull out of each fillet of salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Ducktrap began slowly _ and inefficiently, it seems. The way
FitzGerald tells it, he bumbled along, often making the wrong
decisions for the right reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may not work,'' he decided early on, at a moment when he
was feeding fingerling trout for an hour each day. ``I loved the
routine of husbanding these critters along,'' he says now. ``The
farming piece was punctuated by tragedy.'' He kept losing fish.
</P>
<P>
   The smokehouse, now the heart of the business, began as a
sideline. Trout farming alone wasn't making enough money to keep
him going.
</P>
<P>
   He built a 4-by-4-foot smoker from directions in a government
pamphlet. ``It was a little shed with no control.'' In 1981, he
bought a real smoker from England that held 20 sides of salmon.
Ultimately, he gave up trout farming _ but only when Batley
declared, ``You can't expect us to feed trout and smoke fish.''
</P>
<P>
   After a trip to England and Scotland, FitzGerald set his sights
on a product you might see as part of an old-fashioned British
breakfast, along with broiled tomatoes, fried eggs, and dark slices
of buttered toast: a glistening, golden brown, smoky fillet of
trout.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That trout would become Ducktrap's first signature item. But
today salmon has edged out trout, with 65 percent of sales coming
from three grades of salmon. The top of the line is Kendall Brook,
named for the old property in Lincolnville, which Ducktrap left in
1992 because ``it wasn't a place to do manufacturing in any kind of
scale. You've got to be hooked up to city water, be accessible to
roads,'' FitzGerald says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kendall Brook is the most worked product in the system,'' he
says, Atlantic Salmon's fillet trimmed so that slices resemble a
loin; 4 ounces cost about $6. Winter Harbor smoked salmon uses the
same fish, but it's not trimmed as well; it costs $1 less than
Kendall Brook. (Winter Harbor is the salmon used in Whole Foods'
house brand, and it's also the one many chefs use.) A third
product, labeled Spruce Point, is Chilean salmon and costs about $4
per 4 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon production is closely coordinated with fishing. The way
Ducktrap and Atlantic Salmon work is that Ducktrap knows when
Atlantic is pulling the salmon out of the water. ``If the fish is
four days old, it is going to take salt up much faster than
Tuesday's fish,'' says FitzGerald. He really wants fish ``at the
point just on the other side of rigor.''
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturing end of the plant is carefully protected from
contamination. No visitor can enter without donning a lab coat,
hairnet, and knee-high boots. A visitor also has to scrub up and
dip her boots into disinfectant at the entrance to each new area.
</P>
<P>
   A tour begins, as some plant tours do, at the end, with the
finished product. As we watch women at a table, packaging slices of
salmon on pieces of cold, foil-surfaced cardboard, Dusty Batley
outlines the process. ``Most smoking technology comes out of
Europe,'' Batley says. Most of Ducktrap's machinery is European,
and so is the style of smoking for which the company is known.
</P>
<P>
   The fish start out in a brine of salt, spices, and dehydrated
cane juice _ ``Myer's Rum in granulated form,'' jokes FitzGerald.
</P>
<P>
   Then it is rinsed and chilled until a pellicle forms _ a
``skin'' on top of the fish that prevents drying during smoking.
Still on tall racks, the salmon heads for the smokers, called
kilns, which look like stainless steel, institutional refrigerators
with a few more thermostats. The salmon goes through a cold smoke
process _ the temperature doesn't go above 90 degrees _ so the
smoked fish has nearly the same translucent texture as uncooked
salmon, and it's easy to slice thinly on German slicing machines.
FitzGerald likes its ``peach melba'' color.
</P>
<P>
   Trout is given a hot smoke, as are juicy Maine mussels.
</P>
<P>
   A mixture of oak, hardwood, and fruitwood chips fuels the fire,
which circulates through the kilns. Ducktrap's newest kiln is one
of five in the world. ``Instead of air to dry out the kiln, it uses
a refrigeration cooler to pull moisture out of the air and
recirculate it,'' Batley says. The machine cost $180,000 and can
process 2,000 pounds of salmon at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're after is as little flame as possible,'' says
FitzGerald. ``A smoldering fire that gives us a maximum amount of
smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Batley calls it a ``smudge'' fire. ``In the old days, they lit
smudge fires to keep the bugs away,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, FitzGerald left the smoke and salmon behind to attend
his 25th Harvard reunion and catch up with the classmates he calls
his ``outlaw friends.'' The '70s, he says, were a great time to go
to college, ``but you couldn't say we were the most responsible
people in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Like FitzGerald, like his business, and like life in general,
the friends have changed. ``I didn't perceive a whole lot of outlaw
left in them,'' he says.

NO ANSWERS ON `EYES WIDE SHUT' FROM US; NEW YORKER'S STORIES 
</HEADLINE>

 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   Don't take the bait on the cover of the July issue of Us. Over a
photo of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, the magazine asks, ``The
Sexiest Movie Ever?'' as if it has some kind of answer, as if
someone somehow affiliated with the magazine has seen more than the
trailer of ``Eyes Wide Shut'' and is going to tell us something _
anything _ about it. But the story is just regurgitated quotes
about how long the filming took, the close relationship between
among Kidman, Cruise, and ``control freak'' Stanley Kubrick, and
the source of the script, a 1926 novella by Austrian writer Arthur
Schnitzler. Maybe the fictional truths of Cruise's nemesis, the
National Enquirer (``TOM CRUISE &AMP; NICOLE'S SEX FILM SHOCKER''),
would be more fun than this artificially sweetened juice.
</P>
<P>
   The summer fiction issue of The New Yorker for June 21 and 28
looks like a keeper for the beach this summer, despite its silly
concept: ``20 Writers for the 21st Century.'' The 15 men and 5
women who contribute stories (five of which are excerpts of stories
that will appear in their entirety in future issues) include Ethan
Canin, David Foster Wallace, A. M. Homes, William T. Vollmann,
Michael Chabon, and Allegra Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   Fiction editor Bill Buford writes an introduction to the issue
that nicely defuses the absurd idea of choosing 20 of today's
``best'' young fiction writers _ and then offers this very clever
summary of what happened to the novel in the 20th century: ``It
would be politicized, existentialized, modernized, post-modernized,
post-post-modernized, deconstructed, and reconstructed. It would be
paperbacked, mass-marketed, pulped, and Oprahed. It would abandon
narrative, imitate thought, abandon thought, imitate formless
thought, abandon formless thought, imitate formlessness, abandon
formlessness, and rediscover form. It would become exhausted, then
die, and then somehow survive its Wake, and its many imitations. It
would be pinched by Borges, puffed out by Grass, reshaped by
Calvino, and, finally, come to rest, poised on the eve of another
century.'' Bravo!
</P>
<P>
   Will Smith seems like a nice guy, even if he does own four
sports utility vehicles, enough automotive mass to plow down the
army of a small country. (Maybe Steven Spielberg should remake his
renegade truck thriller, ``Duel,'' for the millennium, featuring a
teen on a car phone driving a SUV with tinted windows and chasing
down a sweet little old lady in a new VW bug?) Anyway, the July
Vanity Fair puts Smith on its cover, since he has gained a
reputation as the July man at the box office with summer hits
``Independence Day,'' ``Men in Black,'' and the forthcoming ``Wild
Wild West.''
</P>
<P>
   The upbeat Smith is so popular, it's easy to forget that he has
appeared in only five movies. He portrays himself as a happy family
man and a casual actor except during the making of ``Six Degrees of
Separation,'' when he became too consumed with his role: ``It was
the only film I did that I didn't have fun. Just completely lost
myself _ to the point that when I came back to `The Fresh Prince'
the next year, I wasn't funny. I couldn't tell a joke to save my
life.'' He's more comfortable trying to negotiate mainstream
America through comedy, about which he has some elaborate theories:
``Black people like very real, very raw comedy. Black people like
to find comedy in what is. White people like to find comedy in what
should be or could be or would be. . . . Meaning white people look
more to escape reality in comedy. And I think a lot of it has to do
with people of oppression. Because Jews really appreciate raw, real
comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in VF, there is a long story about Ernest Hemingway
and a married woman named Jane Kendall Mason, with whom he may have
had an affair, and whom he used to create a few of his characters.
The article is written by Mason's granddaughter, based on the
letters she found in an old steamer trunk. Aside from the VF-style
literary porn aspect, which includes a photo of the old man, the
sea, and a very full moon that's not in the sky, the story becomes
increasingly interesting as Mason's therapist writes an article
that trashes Hemingway and as Mason herself ends up a tragic figure
in Greenwich Village, struggling against possession by multiple
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   In the Rolling Stone for June 24, Marilyn Manson offers up an
impassioned defense against accusations that he and his band are
somehow at the root of the youth violence that led to the Columbine
tragedy. He notes that Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were not
Manson fans, that he became a scapegoat in the face of the
irrationality of the murders, and that humans don't need
entertainment to feel murderous. ``The day that Cain bashed his
brother Abel's brains in, the only motivation he needed was his own
human disposition to violence,'' he writes, going on to look at the
value of rock artists to youth and the fact that while two were

EQUALITY ON THE HOMEFRONT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long before gender equality became part of the PC lexicon,
Francine M. Deutsch knew her own marriage would be a full
partnership. As far as she was concerned, there was no other way.
</P>
<P>
   The 51-year-old Mount Holyoke social psychologist had watched
her mother push personal desires aside to satisfy the family's
needs while doing most of the work at home.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsch's mother eventually found a job as a clerical worker and
became part of that second wave of women who descended on the
workplace in the 1960s. Still, the message Deutsch received from
her mother was, ``You can do more. You can have a career. You can
achieve in school. . .'' and manage a family and a home, too.
</P>
<P>
   But Deutsch wasn't sure she wanted to. ``I knew I did not have
it in me to do all the hard work at home,'' she said. ``I just did
not see myself as a super woman.''
</P>
<P>
   The women I knew growing up did not consider themselves super
women, but they were. Those who worked outside the house returned
home eight hours later to work running the home. In some cases,
husbands pitched in.
</P>
<P>
   With images of their mothers still fresh in their minds, the
daughters of those women were bent on having different lives. And
they did. Unlike their own mothers, they grappled with balancing
full-fledged careers with the demands of child care and homework.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the daughters of those super women are remaking the
rules. But role reversals don't happen overnight. And Deutsch, who
has spent 10 years studying how working couples divvy up child care
and homework, can attest to that.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, she began hearing stories about how life had
changed for women. But when she ventured past their work lives and
into their personal lives, she saw how little things had changed.
Working women, particularly middle-class professional women, were
still very much in charge of parenting.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after delving into the lives of 300 middle-class and
blue-collar couples, Deutsch has written a book that shatters some
popular myths. ``Halving It All: How Equally Shared Parenting
Works,'' (1999, Harvard University Press, $24.95), examines various
ways couples in the study chose to handle work, parenting, and
home.
</P>
<P>
   One of her key findings: Among professional, two-career couples,
the woman is still expected to shoulder much of the parenting
responsibilities. Blue-collar couples are ``the people who are
making the real changes in gender equality.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to popular views, she found blue-collar or
working-class couples more likely to equally share parenting than
middle-class professionals, who tend to pay outsiders to care for
their children and their homes. While professionals often have more
autonomy at work, they also spend long hours on the job and at
meetings, conferences, and other career-enhancing activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at men who are responsible for caring for
children under three, it is disproportionately blue-collar men,''
said Deutsch. ``When you look at professionals, you'll find that
nurses very often change their schedules to fit the needs of
children and child care, but other professionals are less likely
to. And, even when you look at nurses, you'll find that very often
they are married to blue-collar workers who are caring for the
children when they are working.'' Nurses and blue-collar workers
are more likely to have the option of working different shifts than
are many professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the blue-collar couples Deutsch talked to were loathe to
leave their children with ``strangers.'' They did not consider day
care an optimal form of care. Instead, they turned first to
relatives. When relatives were not available, they turned to each
other. And men in these families were more apt to change their
hours to meet their children's needs than were professional men.
Many surveyed told Deutsch the cost of day care was not a factor in
their decision to provide care within the family as opposed to
using outside providers.
</P>
<P>
   But regardless of family circumstances or economic standing,
Deutsch found, women tend to do more negotiating with employers for
flexibility than men. And women were still more likely to choose
part-time work as a scheduling option than men.
</P>
<P>
   That disturbed Deutsch. ``When only one parent is doing all the
cutting back, it has long-term negative consequences for women in
the workplace. It spirals. Women end up with worse jobs, making
significantly less money than their husbands, who are taking
advantage of all the opportunities at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result,'' she said, ``his job will be more rewarding, he
will make more money, and, because he has been consistent and has
not taken time off, he will be more likely to move into a better
job.''
</P>
<P>
   In families in which husbands and wives took turns cutting back
in order to spend more time as parents, such uneven job and career
development rarely occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back at her own experience, Deutsch acknowledges that
her career at a women's college and her husband's job as a
professor have made it easier to achieve the flexibility and
equality she wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had very favorable circumstances,'' she said. ``Mount
Holyoke put in a maternity leave policy the year I became a parent,
back in 1986. I not only had family-friendly policies, but my
husband is a professor, too. So he had flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Pausing, Deutsch reflected on her study's findings. ``It is
possible to create a balance,'' she said. ``Yet we often talk about
families in ways that indicate that women are always struggling to
get men to do more. That does not have to be the case, and it isn't
in some families.''
</P>
<P>
   Creating balance and deciding how parenting will be shared is
far more complex than the so-called gender wars. Instead, noted
Deutsch, what happens at work, with our friends, at home, and in
other aspects of our personal lives all influence how easy or hard
it will to be create equality at home.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON -- Mark Levin is a television junkie who likes to
gamble and dress in drag for Halloween; last year he was a French
maid whose off-the-shoulder dress exposed a sea of moles.
</P>
<P>
   He's also the Pied Piper of the biotechnology industry.
</P>
<P>
   A cancer-research director sacrificed a joint appointment at
Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School to follow
Levin to his new company. A Harvard professor led an exodus of nine
graduate students from his lab to work for Levin. One of Abbott
Laboratories' top scientists traded security for Levin's unproven
venture. And no fewer than six members of the National Academy of
Sciences have agreed to sit on his company's advisory board,
including Eric Lander, director of the Whitehead/MIT Center for
Genome Research.
</P>
<P>
   Levin, the founder and chief executive of Millennium
Pharmaceuticals Inc., is an unlikely man to have assembled this
stable of thoroughbreds.
</P>
<P>
   But he has a cult-like following among the pedigreed scientists
streaming into the labs of Millennium, a Cambridge, Mass. company
whose payroll has reached 800 employees in just six years.
</P>
<P>
   What attracts them to Levin is his ambitious plan to build a
company around a yet-unproven technology. They're using discoveries
emerging from the human genome project _ a worldwide research
effort that is near its goal of mapping the 100,000 or so human
genes and billions of DNA building blocks _ to search for drugs
that will treat everything from cancer to obesity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the fundamental change'' that Millennium's research could
bring to ``biotechnology research that brought me here,'' said
Robert Tepper, who left a joint posting at Harvard and Mass.
General to join Millennium as chief scientific officer.
</P>
<P>
   Levin, whose resume includes stints as a shoe salesman, chemical
engineer, and venture capitalist, has used the golden credentials
of his scientific team to attract huge amounts of money from the
world's pharmaceutical giants to share the cost of this expensive,
cutting-edge research.
</P>
<P>
   When most biotech companies are scraping for funds, Millennium
has won commitments for $1.25 billion, spread over several years,
from the likes of Bayer AG, Eli Lilly &AMP; Co., Pfizer, and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millennium is not the only company'' raising money through
such partnerships, said Stephen Pagliuca, managing director of Bain
Capital, a Boston investment firm with no stake in Millennium.
``But they're probably doing it bigger and better than most.''
</P>
<P>
   Millennium, like any new biotech company, is hugely risky. The
company posted $10.3 million in profits last year as a result of
its pharmaceutical deals, but it has no products on the market and
its scientists are burning up $200 million a year on research.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Question unanswered
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate question for Millennium _ and Levin _ is no
different from that for any fledgling biotech firm: Can it one day
produce a drug that will make it onto pharmacy shelves?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been no proof in the pudding yet,'' Pagliuca said.
</P>
<P>
   But Levin's ability to raise so much money, aided by his chief
dealmaker _ Steven Holtzman, a former Rhodes scholar who quotes
Wittgenstein around the office _ has given them the resources they
need to do their work.
</P>
<P>
   At Millennium, scientists say they can do more than they did
working for universities, while being free of the stifling
environment of well-funded US pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not limited at all. Whatever it takes,'' said Jose
Carlos Gutierrez-Ramos, senior director of inflammatory-disease
research, who marvels at his access to some 150 gene-sequencing
machines that run around the clock at Millennium. Harvard Medical
School, his previous employer, had only two.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason spectacular scientists want to come to Millennium
is because spectacular scientists work at Millennium,'' Lander
explained. ``Mark saw that from the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   There is so much adrenaline pumping through Millennium that
employees admit that work can be chaotic.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A series of obsessions
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the hubbub is Levin, the team's inspirational
leader. Levin's mantra _ ``We believe that nothing is impossible''
_ is on every employee's mouse pad.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium's chief executive has a beachcomber persona. Though
the 48-year-old Levin likes to watch television, his life is a
series of obsessions with ever-bigger projects; it took him a
decade to renovate a turreted Victorian mansion in the
Haight-Ashbury section of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   His wit, delivered in a flat Midwestern voice, is disarming. In
a second, he becomes serious. He was determined to win a candlepin
bowling match he entered to raise college money for inner-city
students, and so he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is far more shrewd than he appears,'' said a former
employee.
</P>
<P>
   Levin's life has not followed a straight path. As a youth, he
seemed destined to follow in his father's footsteps as a St. Louis
shoe store owner.
</P>
<P>
   Levin shares his father's passion for shoes and gambling. He
owns dozens of pairs of shoes, and he recently took his wife and
baby daughter, Samantha, to the horse track at Suffolk Downs in
East Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But a painful event when he was a teenager sent his life in a
different direction. At age 16, Levin's mother died of cancer,
leaving him to care for three younger sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid just dug in, went to his books, took care of his
sisters,'' said his father, Martin Levin. ``He took care of
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   After high school graduation, Levin hung around his hometown for
a while, earning a master's in biochemical engineering from
Washington University. He sold more shoes, but not for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time chemical engineers were making $13,000 to
$14,000, and he was paying me, like, $7,000,'' Levin deadpanned.
``I thought maybe this isn't the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Right before leaving his hometown and close-knit family, Levin
met his future wife, Becky Levin, whom his father had hired for the
summer to work in the shoe store.
</P>
<P>
   Levin's first engineering job, in 1976, was working for Eli
Lilly in Indianapolis, but he drove home weekends in his yellow
Triumph TR-7 to see his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a statute of limitations?'' he asked, revealing that
she was 16 when they began dating. He was 24.
</P>
<P>
   At Lilly, Levin worked under William Young, a chief engineer who
would later go to Genentech, a California biotech company. Levin
``interviewed without socks,'' Young recalled, adding that Lilly
executives thought he was ``a little weird.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Good at thinking differently
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Young stood by him. ``Mark _ even then you could see it _ is
good at thinking a little differently about things,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   The Levins moved to Eden, N.C., where he worked for Miller
Brewing Co. and she attended the University of North Carolina. The
move was a success, despite the ill-advised purchase of a doughnut
shop. Next, Levin worked briefly for the Foxboro Co. in Foxborough,
selling computers to the biotech industry. Among the clients he
courted was Young, who had by then moved on to Genentech.
</P>
<P>
   Levin recalled saying to Young: `` `Would you be interested in a
process control system for Genentech?' And he said, `Would you be
interested in joining Genentech?' That's how I got into biotech.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, when Levin moved to the San Francisco Bay area for
Genentech, he found himself at one of the most exciting companies
in the industry's heyday. He was eventually promoted to manager of
various drug projects _ working under David Goeddel, a pioneering
scientist in the early years of biotech _ and he developed a knack
for managing complex projects.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Levin went to the Mayfield Fund, a San Francisco
venture capital firm, where he founded many companies. Millennium
was his last.
</P>
<P>
   His concept was so unusual that his wife, who is an executive
search professional, concluded after a nine-month hunt for a chief
executive that her husband was the only one with the vision _ or
understanding _ to run the company he had created. He took the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear Mark had a vision for this company that wasn't
going to translate well to someone else,'' Becky Levin said over
lunch at the Four Seasons, around the corner from the couple's
apartment on the Public Garden.
</P>
<P>
   After Levin created Millennium, it continued to evolve. The germ
of an idea for the company started with Raju Kucherlapati, who
approached Levin at the Mayfield Fund about financial backing.
Kucherlapati, now chairman of the molecular genetics department at
the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, had already
founded one small company with Levin's help.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, a company that would develop gene-derived
drugs was still a novel idea. Levin became fascinated with
genomics, diving into scientific papers on gene identification. He
organized marathon brainstorming sessions with Kucherlapati,
Lander, and Jeff Friedman, a geneticist who discovered leptin, a
gene linked to obesity.
</P>
<P>
   While the scientists could see the potential for one day
understanding diseases _ and therapies _ in terms of genes, it was
Levin who translated their ideas into a commercial venture,
explained Friedman, a professor at the Howard Hughes Medical
Institute at Rockefeller University. ``I learned an enormous
amount.''
</P>
<P>
   Lander, a world-renowned biologist, was being courted by
numerous biotech firms. Levin won him over.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium's headquarters _ a few blocks from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology _ was chosen to be close to its scientific
founders.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Relentless in pursuit
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once Levin decides he wants a scientist to work at Millennium,
he is relentless. Louis Tartaglia was doing postdoctoral work for
Genentech when Levin decided he wanted him as Millennium's first
scientist. Many companies were in hot pursuit of Tartaglia; he
agreed to take the job after Levin offered the struggling student a
$10,000 signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Tartaglia's work on obesity is among the company's most
promising avenues for delivering a drug for clinical trials,
according to the company. His colleague, Karen Moore, published a
paper in March in the journal Nature reporting that her group had
successfully cloned a gene, mahogany, that suppresses obesity in
mice that overeat.
</P>
<P>
   But obesity research is but one of dozens of research projects
Millennium is pursuing. What has distinguished Millennium from
others pursuing gene-derived drugs is less their products than
their process.
</P>
<P>
   Levin's ultimate goal is to make drug discovery efficient and
productive, much like the industrial beer brewery he built for
Miller in his early career as a chemical engineer.
</P>
<P>
   The glue holding all this together is the ``bioinformatics''
group, which is using computers and data analysis to make sense of
the streams of data Millennium scientists churn out.
</P>
<P>
   Only Levin could have put it all together, say those who have
worked with him. And only Levin may know where it's going.
</P>
<P>
   Said Michael Levinthal, a Mayfield partner, ``Just give him an
office and hire him and see where it goes.''

CSX BUFFS UP RAIL LINES AFTER CONRAIL TAKEOVER  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Since CSX Transportation took over Conrail's 470 miles
of rail lines in Massachusetts 12 days ago, officials have expected
that hundreds of Bay State companies would give rail shipping a new
look. Greg Conigliaro is proving them right.
</P>
<P>
   Conigliaro, president of a 10-year-old Framingham recycling
business that bears his family's name, is so excited about the
prospect of single-line access to the entire eastern United States
that he is arranging to have a rail siding built to his Fountain
Street plant, so he can start shipping by gondola cars, instead of
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Each month, Conigliaro Industries grinds up as much as 200,000
pounds of plastic for reprocessing. That includes old computer
housings that are turned into a pothole-patching material, as well
as huge piles of wood, paper, and cardboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a great way to move huge quantities of freight,''
Conigliaro says of the rail cars he hopes to be parking outside the
plant by year's end, each of which can hold as much as four truck
trailers. ``Anything we can do to remove the trucking aspect of
this business will be great.''
</P>
<P>
   After two years of planning, CSX and Norfolk Southern formally
took over their respective halves of the old Conrail on June 1. The
$10.3 billion takeover of the freight line created in 1976 from six
bankrupt lines in the Northeast has gone smoothly so far.
</P>
<P>
   CSX inherited all the Conrail lines in Massachusetts, including
the main line from Allston to Pittsfield. Norfolk Southern will
have competing access to the region through a connection with the
1,500-mile Guilford Rail System _ which includes the old Boston &AMP;
Maine _ at Mechanicsville, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials say the CSX takeover could revolutionize rail
traffic in the Bay State by offering local shippers for the first
time good single-line north-south service to as far away as Florida
and Louisiana. Conrail focused chiefly on east-west service to
Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see it as a very positive step for Massachusetts,'' said
Michael P. Hogan, head of MassDevelopment, a quasipublic industrial
development corporation that issues bonds and runs a business park
at the former Fort Devens in Ayer. ``It opens up new territory and
allows for greater rail access to the South at much more
competitive prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, there are signs that the CSX takeover could lead to
increased use of the 1,058 miles of rail line in Massachusetts:
</P>
<P>
   --Braintree-based Bay Colony railroad, which runs five branch
lines feeding into CSX, has customers looking into new inbound rail
deliveries from South Carolina and outbound to Alabama, which can
be handled entirely by CSX.
</P>
<P>
   Those deals would have been hard sells if Bay Colony were still
linked to Conrail, because ``its heart was in east-to-west'' and it
had little appetite for attracting shipments requiring transfer to
a southern line, said Bernie Reagan, Bay Colony's senior vice
president for marketing and sales. He declined to identify the
customers, for competitive reasons.
</P>
<P>
   --Guilford, which already offers a ``Press Runner'' train
shipping Maine paper to Pennsylvania and Illinois, has found
enthusiastic response among Maine paper plants and other shippers
looking to move southbound shipments from trucks to rail, said
executive vice president David Fink.
</P>
<P>
   Through its New York connection to Norfolk and links to CSX at
Worcester and Springfield, Guilford customers ``now have two
choices, and all the people we have spoken to are very, very
happy,'' Fink said.
</P>
<P>
   --Several electrical parts handlers and frozen food dealers and
distributors are working to expand or locate at the Myles Standish
Industrial Park in North Taunton. The park is served by a private
spur to CSX and includes 150 as-yet-undeveloped acres open to rail
service, said Richard L. Shafer of the Taunton industrial
development commission.
</P>
<P>
   --CSX industrial development officials are helping Bay Colony
generate interest in trackside parcels along the line in locations
such as Medfield, Middleborough, and Millis, according to Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is a harder market than many other states for
railroads to crack, because there are few big industrial facilities
like chemical plants, paper mills, or auto factories, which are
well suited to train service. Both of the state's big coal-fired
power plants, in Salem and Somerset, which would otherwise be ideal
rail customers, are served by barge.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the last year for which the Association of American
Railroads has statistics, 451,076 carloads of freight moved through
Massachusetts, the equivalent of 24 50-car freight trains every
day.
</P>
<P>
   That figure includes 2.5 million tons of freight originated
within the state _ including scrap metal, containers, and mixed
freight _ and 9 million tons delivered in the state, including
piggyback trailer-on-flatcar trains.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts railroads also handle a considerable fraction of
the 3.3 million tons of pulp, paper, and lumber products shipped
from Maine to US destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation officials say the CSX takeover of Conrail offers
huge possibilities for moving truck trailers off Interstate 95 and
onto intermodal trains of the kind often seen coming to the Allston
rail yard.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Howarth, vice president of commercial operations for CSX in
Selkirk, N.Y., said CSX officials envision new markets for shipping
food, paper, packaging, structural steel, limestone, and basic
chemicals into New England from the Southeast, including clays used
in Maine paper mills.
</P>
<P>
   New outbound markets could develop for hauling scrap metal and
recyclables to Deep South processing, as well as container traffic
and general freight now riding southward in trucks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rail shipping may not turn out to be for everyone, especially
not retailers or high-tech manufacturers, which count on the rapid,
super-dependable delivery trucks can offer.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Abreu, plant manager for Northeast Refrigerated Terminals in
Taunton, a frozen food warehouse that gets deliveries from around
the United States through Bay Colony, said businesses considering
rail can save a lot of money but need to manage inventories and
schedule deliveries more carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes two or three times as long to get product, but if you
plan ahead well, you can save a lot of money,'' Abreu said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether CSX has an estimate for the possible growth of
rail shipping in Massachusetts, Howarth said: ``The truth is, we
don't know. We don't have an internal number.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus is really on converting the long-haul business from
truck to rail,'' Howarth said. Given the huge premium CSX paid for
its half of Conrail after an initial bidding war with Norfolk
Southern, Howarth said, ``We're going to essentially pay for this
merger with new business, and that means providing better service
and better equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   CSX plans what Howarth calls major capital investments locally,
adding switches and spurs and perhaps reinstalling second tracks
that were removed on some mainlines as rail traffic dwindled in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Sedares, general counsel to the 545-mile Providence &AMP;
Worcester railroad, said of CSX: ``They clearly are interested in
growing business in the region. They have a fairly aggressive
marketing strategy, which they have asked us to work on. Overall,
we think it's positive for the region.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the P&AMP;W saw a 9.3 percent increase in container
loads, to 47,000 containers, and a 14 percent increase in
freightcar traffic, to 34,800 carloads. P&AMP;W officials are hopeful
their connection to CSX in Worcester can help boost growth further.
</P>
<P>
   Conrail _ now dubbed ``GoneRail'' by some industry insiders _
earned high marks for creating profitable and reliable service from
once moribund Northeastern lines, such as the Penn Central. But
many see a much more gung-ho attitude toward attracting new
business from CSX.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conrail was a good company with good people, but CSX is
bringing in a whole new level of marketing and expertise,'' said
Conigliaro, the Framingham recycler. Four years ago, he considered
having a siding installed, but Conrail's price was far higher than
CSX is proposing.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Cogley, economic development director for the MetroWest
Chamber of Commerce in Framingham, said area business people were
impressed with the enthusiasm of CSX officials when they held a
rail-shipping conference earlier this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the railroads have kind of woken up and realized they
are in the transportation business, and they better start
competing,'' Cogley said.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Colony's Reagan, who worked for Conrail in the 1970s, said
he already sees from CSX ``a new, fresh look at north-south
traffic, a different attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With Conrail, they'd say, `We'll talk to you after we get
through with the Chicago guys,' but then they never got through
with the Chicago guys and just didn't care'' about shippers looking
to move goods to or from southern destinations, Reagan said. ``It
was just not what they wanted, and they just didn't think it was
what God wanted them to do.''

MELTDOWN OF NET STOCKS DOESN'T DROWN MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since the Internet stocks began their meteoric rise,
investors have lived with one overriding fear: that when the stocks
collapsed, it would be like the assassination of Archduke
Ferdinand, the trigger for much wider carnage. (Think World War I.)
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks haven't totally collapsed, but they have fallen
a long way. Most are down 40 to 50 percent in the past two months.
But guess what? The stock market as a whole has largely ignored the
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the major market averages have dropped since Internet
stocks peaked in early April, but the declines have been modest and
most of the loss can be attributed to rising interest rates. So far
at least, the Internet damage has been confined to the Internet
sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very positive development,'' says Philip Schettewi, a
money manager for Loomis Sayles in Washington. Rather than head for
the hills, says Schettewi, investors have simply moved their money
to other places. Economically sensitive stocks have attracted more
money; so have small and mid-cap stocks; even certain technology
stocks have done better.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've had a whole series of separate games going on in the
stock market,'' says Larry Haverty, senior vice president for State
Street Research. ``It turns out that the Internet game was only one
of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet game has not been much fun to play since April when
reality began to set in. Amazon.com contributed to the mood shift
in late April when it announced it would take longer to achieve
profitability than previously anticipated. Internet investors to
that point had been very tolerant of losses, but the Amazon news
made them wonder whether they had been too trusting.
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates have hurt too. Because Internet companies
will earn their money sometime in the future, higher rates make
those earnings worth less in today's dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the electronic brokerage stocks took a nasty tumble when
Charles Schwab said its on-line trading volume declined in May.
America Online, the closest thing to an Internet blue chip, has
been hurt by suggestions that its membership numbers are not
climbing as fast as they once were.
</P>
<P>
   Put it all together and what you get is a major correction.
Amazon is down 55 percent from its springtime high; America Online
is down 43 percent; CMGI, an Andover company with stakes in a group
of Internet companies, is off 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So why hasn't the stock market collapsed in sympathy?
</P>
<P>
   Ned Riley offers one possible explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet buyer has always been a different breed of cat,''
says Riley, chief investment officer for BankBoston. According to
Riley, Internet stocks have been driven by individual investors,
rather than institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   The amateurs fell in love with the Internet, he says, and they
are the ones who have had their hearts and finances broken while
the professionals have mostly watched from the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The institutions haven't felt the pain,'' says Riley.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Haverty makes much the same argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a certain group of people have been investing in the
Internet area,'' he says. ``You've had some very aggressive funds
and an enormous amount of public speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, big-time investors haven't avoided all the pain.
Statistics gathered by Thomson Financial Securities Data show that
Fidelity Investments has bought its share of Internet stocks. As of
the end of the first quarter of 1999, Fidelity owned 3 percent of
America Online, 8 percent of CMGI, and 2 percent of Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   There's another possible explanation for the market's relative
indifference to the Internet meltdown. Simply put, this is one
awfully resilient stock market. Over the past two years the market
has managed to survive the Asian financial crisis, the Russian
financial crisis, the near-impeachment of a president, a war in
Europe, and several inflation scares.
</P>
<P>
   The market has sagged, but it has never collapsed. Investors
still apparently believe that the US economy can continue to grow
at a decent pace without generating much inflation. That assumption
may yet prove incorrect, but until it does the stock market is
likely to hang around.
</P>
<P>
   Given their lofty valuations, Internet stocks could still fall a
long way from here. If the recent past is any guide, however, the
rest of us won't have to fall along with them.

STUDY TOUTS BAY STATE'S POTENTIAL AS MAJOR DRUG DEVELOPER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- As pharmaceutical companies look past their own
laboratories for breakthrough drugs, Massachusetts _ with its
world-renowned medical research community _ is attracting
significant industry investments and has the potential to become an
international player in drug development, concludes a new report.
</P>
<P>
   Government money has been pouring in as well, according to the
report by Anurag Sharma, an assistant professor of management at
the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. Last year,
Massachusetts received $1.2 billion of the $11.2 billion the
National Institutes of Health awarded nationwide, trailing only
California in funding.
</P>
<P>
   But Massachusetts, relatively weak in drug manufacturing, had
better watch its back, as New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and
North Carolina look to attract major drug firm research and
manufacturing, the report warns.
</P>
<P>
   Titled ``The Economic Impact of the Pharmaceutical Industry in
Massachusetts,'' Sharma's work was funded by industry trade group
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The role that Massachusetts will play in the pharmaceutical
industry of the next millennium will be driven by the strength of
research in its universities and institutions and by the ability of
the general economic infrastructure to support investments,'' the
report concludes. ``Conversely, the economic impact of the
pharmaceutical industry on the Commonwealth will be greatly
influenced by the perception about how attractive it is to make
investments in the
</P>
<P>
   state and local economies.''
</P>
<P>
   That bullish outlook stems from rapid changes within the large
pharmaceutical firms, which have recognized that the next
generation of medicine will come from research-intensive areas such
as Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Already, pharmaceutical giants such as Pfizer Inc. have
established research facilities in Cambridge, while Merck &AMP; Co. is
reportedly looking to build its own laboratories in Boston's Fenway
area, not far from the Longwood Medical Area.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, Amgen Inc., the nation's largest biotechnology firm,
will break ground on an eight-story research center in Cambridge's
Kendall Square, next door to Genzyme Corp., the state's largest
biotech company. And last week, American Home Products broke ground
for a second research facility in Cambridge for its Genetics
Institute subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts, according to Sharma's report, could become ``the
center of gravity for the global pharmaceutical industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, many big US and foreign drug companies have made hefty
investments in local emerging biotechnology firms to gain access to
promising new drugs and collaborative relationships with Boston
area research universities and teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The UMass study _ based in part on a survey mailed to 210
biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms operating in Massachusetts _
noted that of the 32 that responded, nearly all had significant
links to research universities in Greater Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $1.2 billion federal funding Massachusetts received last
year, $630 million went to a wide range of universities, teaching
hospitals, and other research organizations in Greater Boston, well
ahead of the amounts received by New York, San Diego, Philadelphia,
and Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Private industry and venture capitalists also spent a hefty
amount in the growing biopharmaceutical industry, which employs
more than 12,500 in Massachusetts in drug-related commercial
research. Combined with the nonprofit sector, 25,000 people do
medical research-related work in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Bay State's biopharmaceutical community is to
prosper, says Sharma, it must address shortcomings in
biomanufacturing and remain competitive with other states.

NEW CODE FOR MEN OF COLOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VANESSA E. JONES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Kohls makes it his business to look for gaps in the magazine
market. He found one a year and a half ago as he perused men's
fashion magazines at airport newsstands. He saw industry stalwarts
like GQ and Esquire. He spied young upstarts like Maxim, Gear,
P.O.V., and Men's Health.
</P>
<P>
   But when it came to a style magazine focused on the interests
and needs of black men, there was nothing. Zilch.
</P>
<P>
   So Kohls headed back to the Los Angeles office of Larry Flynt
Publications (better known as LFP), where he is president. Soon he
was pitching the idea of launching a black GQ to Flynt, who's best
known for publishing Hustler.
</P>
<P>
   LFP put together an editorial team headed by A.G. Britton, a
magazine veteran who launched Mirabella, Marie Claire, and Mode;
and Quincy Troupe, a poet, writer, and professor. On June 1, Code
began popping up on newsstands nationwide with a dapper Samuel L.
Jackson gazing from its cover.
</P>
<P>
   A glossy monthly style magazine, Code showcases a dazzling array
of chocolate-covered eye candy sporting long nubian locks, short
Afros, and bold baldies. It slaps poetry next to fashion
photographs of Saul Williams, a poet who starred in the recent
indie film ``Slam.'' It pairs luxurious Dolce &AMP; Gabbana suits with
less pricey BCBG shirts. It hilariously delves into the subject of
women stalkers and more somberly explores the relationship between
fathers and sons.
</P>
<P>
   Troupe, Code's editorial director, says it's the kind of
magazine he and other black men have been looking for for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at myself as a barometer for all the ingredients that
should go into this magazine,'' says Troupe, 59. ``I like great
food. I like to travel. I like great art. I like great books. I
like to look at beautiful women. I like style and clothes. I like
really interesting discussions and debates. And I like to talk
about money and health.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's the kind of magazine I'd like to see produced,''
Troupe continues. ``For many many years I've had to go to GQ and
Vanity Fair and Esquire to get what I have not been able to get at
any black magazine. I think there's a lot of men out there like
me.''
</P>
<P>
   A professor at the University of California-San Diego (he's on
sabbatical until September 2000), Troupe spoke about the magazine
from his La Jolla, Calif., home. His enthusiasm was initially
tempered after laser eye surgery for cataracts left a bandage over
his left eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might be a great pirate with a patch,'' Troupe jokes, before
his inner editor takes over. ``I could make a style statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Troupe was hired for his fashion sensibilities. Britton, who
could be a voice double for Fran Drescher, speaks admiringly of
Troupe's ability to mix an ``Armani suit with some fantastic piece
of leather and shells on his wrist just to give it a twist.''
</P>
<P>
   Britton, Code's publication director, also wanted Troupe for his
connections. ``He knows everybody,'' she says. ``And you want an
editor with a big ole fat Rolodex of writers.''
</P>
<P>
   Having been down the black magazine road before, Troupe
initially resisted Britton's advances. In the 1980s, he had tried
to start two fashion magazines for black men. But cutthroat
experiences in New York's magazine industry turned him off, so he
started work on ``Miles: The Autobiography,'' his acclaimed book
about jazz man Miles Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ensconced in LFP's Los Angeles office, Britton and Troupe
have found a magazine world in which they can exhale. As the team
scrambles to shape Code to readers' approval, Britton says she's
happy she's not in New York where editors must parade in Prada
pumps to work the fashion industry. And Troupe rapturously talks
about the ``harmonious'' office where he and Britton make editorial
and style decisions.
</P>
<P>
   While Code is LFP's first upscale lifestyle magazine, it's not
its first mainstream title. About half of LFP's stable of more than
20 magazines focus on subjects such as hip-hop, skateboarding,
video games, boating, and police tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a diverse lineup of focused special-interest
magazines,'' says Tony Silber, editorial director of Folio, a trade
magazine examining the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Now LFP is taking on the tough niche market where
African-American magazines such as Ebony, Black Enterprise, Vibe,
and Essence reign. How tough is it? Five years ago Roy S. Johnson,
an editor-at-large at Time Inc.'s Fortune magazine, pitched the
idea for Savoy, a Vanity Fair-style magazine aimed at affluent
African Americans. The project remains in limbo because Time
executives are worried about finding an audience, says Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of publishers are reluctant to jump into the fray for
whatever reasons,'' he says. ``But there are a lot of younger,
bolder entrepreneurs and publishers who are not afraid to see if
there's a portion of that market that would be interested in
something that they have to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   One such title, Honey, aimed at young black women, debuted in
February. But for every Honey there's an Ebony Man, which ceased
publication last year when Johnson Publishing Company decided to
fold men's features into Ebony, its popular title.
</P>
<P>
   Britton thinks Ebony Man made its own deathbed. ``There are
things you have to pay for in order for consumers and advertisers
to take you seriously,'' she says. ``One is paper, the other is
photography and all that goes into it, meaning the stylist,
location, etc. Ebony Man just did not do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Code definitely does. LFP will spend about $500,000 to $1
million on each issue, says Britton. It's a substantial investment
in a business where a modest start-up may cost $80,000 for six
issues, says Silber.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing African-American magazines don't do is introduce
new editorial talent, says Troupe. ``We wait until the dominant
culture says OK, then we do something with them.'' But Code plans
to introduce new faces (and veteran ones you didn't know about)
before mainstream publications make their moves. In the first issue
Code featured Jesse Allen, a young Los Angeles fashion designer,
and Paris Barclay, an award-winning African-American director and
supervising producer of ``NYPD Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   The approach seems to be working. Although Code officially hit
newstands June 1, some stores put it on display earlier.
</P>
<P>
   At a Borders Books Music &AMP; Cafe in Washington, D.C., which
Troupe visited in May for a poetry reading with Nikki Giovanni, a
woman attending the event discovered Code in the store. ``She said,
`It's beautiful; you have to go see it' '' to others in the
audience, recalls Troupe. ``It started a stampede of people trying
to get this magazine. They bought every one within an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   That enthusiasm seems to be catching. ``Where we got it out
early it either sold out immediately or in a couple of days,'' says
Perry Grayson, LFP's vice president of advertising. ``The magazine
has really been noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   Code has an initial circulation of 500,000. LFP's circulation
powerhouse, Hustler, sells between half a million to a million
copies a month. If Code remains this hot, ``there's a potential
this could be the biggest magazine we publish,'' says Grayson.
</P>
<P>
   But Code still has the fickle male consumer to contend with.
</P>
<P>
   ``While (GQ and Esquire) are successful magazines, none of them
comes close to the typical successful women's books,'' says
Johnson. ``It's a risk whenever you aim your editorial at men that
you won't get to a certain target.''
</P>
<P>
   But Britton believes the style savvy of men of color will keep
them addicted to Code's pages. Both she and Troupe hitch Code's
growth and survival to its editorial content. There's plenty of
talk about bringing Code's writing up to New Yorker and Vanity Fair
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Editorial quality is really critical for us,'' says Britton.
</P>
<P>
   For upcoming issues Troupe has secured exclusive excerpts of new
work by Walter Mosley, Ishmael Reed, and John Edgar Wideman. He's
pulling in young black writers such as Nelson George and Kevin
Powell, and experienced African-American journalists such as the
Los Angeles Times's Sam Fulwood 3d, New York Times sports columnist
William C. Rhoden, and perhaps even syndicated columnist Clarence
Page, who slipped Troupe his business card after flipping through
Code during Troupe's Borders appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Troupe wants to publish stories about the black community not
seen in the mainstream press. For example, a profile of Mike Espy,
the beleaguered former Agriculture Secretary recently acquitted of
corruption charges; and Death Row Records founder Suge Knight's
possible role in the shooting deaths of hip-hop artists Tupac
Shakur and Notorious B.I.G.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to look at every aspect of American life that affects
us critically,'' says Troupe. ``Some of it is not going to cast
(blacks) in a good light. But we want to hang dirty laundry out. I
think we can deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, well-dressed celebrities aren't left out of the mix. The
September issue features an interview and cover shot of Danny
Glover. And Troupe drops the names of film icons, basketball stars,
and politicians _ from Charles Rangel to Allen Iverson _ as
possible Code cover guys.
</P>
<P>
   What happens next year when Troupe returns to the university?
Plans are being made to hire an editor and retain Troupe as
editorial director. ``The three of us will kind of run it,'' says
Troupe, adding tenaciously, ``I'm going to be involved in this
magazine until they kick me out.''

CLINTON AIDE CONCEDES MILOSEVIC MAY GAIN SAFE HAVEN IN SERBIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A White House spokesman Wednesday welcomed the Serbian
Orthodox Church's call for Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
resign but conceded that the indicted war criminal might obtain
safe haven inside his own country if he steps down.
</P>
<P>
   David Leavy, spokesman for President Clinton's National Security
Council, said Milosevic should step aside as demanded by Serbia's
influential Orthodox Church because he remains ``an international
pariah.''
</P>
<P>
   Leavy added that Serbia won't receive international help in
reconstruction as long as Milosevic remains in power. ``The only
question is how far are the Serbian people going to let Milosevic
drag their country down before they replace him,'' Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
   The Holy Synod of the Serbian Orthodox Church demanded
Milosevic's resignation Tuesday ``in the interest of the people and
their salvation.''
</P>
<P>
   The church's governing body said the Serbian people have to
accept that the ``isolation of our country on the international
scene cannot be solved or overcome with this kind of government and
under the present circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   The 15-nation European Union and the 19-nation North Atlantic
Treaty Organization have vowed to withhold all reconstruction
assistance from Serbia until Milosevic steps down. Estimates for
reconstruction costs for the region exceed $50 billion over the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic and his top aides were indicted last month on war
crimes' charges by the International Criminal Tribunal for the
former Yugoslavia (ICTY) headquartered in the Hague, Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal for Milosevic's resignation came as the British-led
Kosovo security force (KFOR) found more suspected mass graves in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The graves are believed to contain the remains of hundreds, if
not thousands, of victims of Yugoslavia's murderous campaign of
``ethnic cleansing'' against ethnic Albanian Muslims who have
occupied Kosovo since the Ottoman Turkish invasion of the Balkans
in the 14th century.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslavs' campaign that began in March uprooted 1.6 million
Kosovars, including more than 800,000 who fled to neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
   NATO under U.S. leadership carried out a 78-day bombing campaign
against Yugoslav forces to force cessation of the ethnic cleansing
and clear the way for the return of ethnic Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Leavy said the 50,000-member NATO force moving into the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo is ``gathering evidence'' of war crimes that
will be presented to the international war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   Troops are assigned as well to arrest indicted Yugoslav war
criminals if they are identified among the retreating troops. No
arrests have been made so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is incumbent on all nations coming into contact with war
criminals to bring them into custody,'' Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House official declined to discuss any plans for
seizing Milosevic or his lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials conceded, however, that NATO
forces operating in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo will not be in
a position to seize Milosevic if he remains inside Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav forces in Serbia remain heavily armed, officials said,
making it virtually impossible for the allies to stage a guerrilla
raid on Belgrade or other Milosevic strongholds to seize indicted
war criminals.
</P>
<P>
   One official conceded: ``I don't see us going into Belgrade to
grab up Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite long-standing indictments against alleged war criminals
from the four-year war in Bosnia, Bosnian Serb leaders Ratko Mladic
and Radovan Karadic remain free inside Serbian-controlled territory
in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Robin Clifford, a spokesman for KFOR in Kosovo, said
Wednesday that allied forces are finding ``a number of burial
sites'' but have not compiled an overall list of suspected graves
or suspected victims.
</P>
<P>
   When suspected burial sites are found, Clifford said, ``We
secure the area to ensure that nobody else can get in there to
disturb any evidence there may well be, but also of course to
ensure that the area is clear of any possible mines or booby traps
there might be there.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea, speaking at alliance headquarters in
Brussels, Belgium, said that ``one of the more harrowing aspects''
of KFOR's deployment has been the discovery of more mass graves
than NATO had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Allied forces also are finding evidence of ``atrocity sites,''
Shea said, referring to buildings where ethnic Albanians were
killed and their bodies left without burial.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said about 300 war crimes investigators are due in Kosovo
in coming days to ``get on the site quickly to gather the evidence
before refugees return or before people have a chance to tamper
with that evidence.''

<P>
   The Federal Bureau of Investigation has joined the effort to
unearth war crimes' evidence in Kosovo. FBI Director Louis J. Freeh
announced in Washington, D.C., that 25 FBI investigators and
forensic specialists are being sent to Kosovo to collect evidence
of war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The team will assess the need for more personnel from the FBI
and the U.S. Armed Forces Institute of Pathology to carry out the
task of proving crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI routinely investigates mass murders in the United
States. FBI agents also took part in war crimes' investigations in
Rwanda and Bosnia, as well as investigations following terrorist
bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

Thursday, June 17:

<P>
   TIFFANY-WINDOWS (New York) _ The colors are warmest in winter,
when the sun's rays are low in the sky and envelop the
stained-glass horizon in amber light. ``This window is certainly
alive,'' Rev. Gerald Johnson was saying the other day, sitting in
the pews of the Sage Memorial First Presbyterian Church in Far
Rockaway, Queens, contemplating the unsung Louis Comfort Tiffany
masterpiece with great gnarled branches. Tiffany designed stained
glass windows such as this ``Tree of Life,'' his largest landscape,
to be sacred. They still are _ not only in distant urban reaches
like Far Rockaway _ but in thousands of quiet corners of the
country. By Patricia Leigh Brown.

   GARDEN-ENTRY (Undated) _ A gateway, or introduction, to a garden
can create a sense of drama or stir curiosity about what lies

by a garden entrance depends on what you want to make it. By Martha
Baker.
</P>
<P>
   OLMSTED-BOOK (New York) _ As boaters clunked their oars on the
lake, Witold Rybczynski folded his big frame onto a little chair by
a tiny cafe table at the boathouse and talked about how he came to
write about the man who created Central Park almost a century and a
half ago. ``I think I thought about the notion of biography
first,'' said Rybczynski, whose new book, ``A Clearing in the
Distance: Frederick Law Olmsted and America in the Nineteenth
Century'' (Scribner), takes an intimate look at the man who first
joined the two words, landscape and architecture, and made it an
art. By Anne Raver.

   DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: Confessions of a second-generation
newspaper addict
</P>
<P>
   (Eds: For Father's Day, June 20.)
</P>
<P>
   (``Dispatches from Dreamsville`` is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox senior writer Joe Murray their
memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or at
least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   By Lois Oller Nasados
</P>
<P>
   Special to Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   An old Strickland Gillilan poem ends with the words, ``I had a
mother who read to me!''
</P>
<P>
   Happily, many of us can also say, ``I had a father who read to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   I remember sitting on my father's knee _ very quietly _ while he
read the Chicago Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   The next-to-last page was my page, the comics. He would read
them to me using a full range of voices and facial expressions that
never failed to delight me.
</P>
<P>
   My mother had her doubts about reading to me from the newspaper,
with all its crime and violence and s-e-x.
</P>
<P>
   But how could she object when her darling daughter was almost
falling off Daddy's lap, laughing at the antics of ``Li'l Abner''
or breathless to learn what new dangers awaited ``Brenda Starr,
Reporter.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, waiting for the comics page to appear, I'd ask about
a picture that caught my eye, usually a photo of a child or an
animal.
</P>
<P>
   My daddy's explanations were, I'm sure, carefully edited, but
there was always an answer.
</P>
<P>
   As I began to learn my alphabet, he would share his adult-sized
pencil, and as he directed, I would carefully enter a capital
letter in a tiny square on his crossword puzzle. Did I feel smart!
</P>
<P>
   In these days of 24-hour newscasts in living color, my day still
includes at least one newspaper, and when I travel there's no
better way to learn about a new community than by reading the local
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   I mourn each time another big-city daily ceases publication, yet
I'm firmly convinced that there are enough newspaper addicts
breeding more newspaper addicts that we needn't worry.
</P>
<P>
   Until someone invents a laptop computer that feels as good in
the hand as unrolling the morning paper, there will always be a
real newspaper to flavor our morning coffee.

BONE DRUG MAY LOWER RISK OF BREAST CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE COSTANTINOU  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A drug given to post-menopausal women to combat
bone disease has been found to dramatically reduce the risk of
breast cancer, according to a study published Wednesday in the
Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   In the international study of 7,705 women with osteoporosis, the
drug raloxifene lowered the risk of all types of breast cancer by
76 percent, said Dr. Steven Cummings of the University of
California at San Francisco. Cummings headed the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The drug was even more effective on the form of breast cancer
common among older women, he said, reducing by 90 percent the type
of cancer associated with estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   ``In medicine, we don't see 90 percent reductions in the risk of
a disease,'' Cummings said. ``The magnitude of the effect has been
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cummings and a Journal editorial cautioned that the drug _ a
designer estrogen that sells under the brand name Evista _ is not a
silver bullet cure and should not be used by the general population
to reduce the risk of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   As with all medicine, there are side effects. And more research
is needed, said Cummings, to determine the drug's effectiveness
over the long term, its impact on menstruating women and on those
not suffering from osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   Medical researchers have long sought ways of reducing breast
cancer _ the most common form of cancer and the second leading
cause of cancer death among women.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 175,000 women in the United States will be
diagnosed with cancer this year, according to the American Cancer
Society. About 43,500 U.S. women died of breast cancer in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Tamoxifen, a drug related to raloxifene, has been approved by
the Food and Drug Administration to fight breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Tamoxifen has been shown to be effective among women who have a
high risk of breast cancer, but most breast cancers occur in women
who are not identified to be at a high risk, according to the
study.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, studies have shown that tamoxifen increases the
risk of uterine cancer, a side effect not true for raloxifene.
Tamoxifen has not been studied for osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   Both raloxifene and tamoxifen can increase blood clots in the
veins, which can be fatal if they travel to the lungs. Like
estrogen, the drugs are therefore not recommended for women with a
history of vein or blood-clotting diseases.
</P>
<P>
   A head-to-head comparison of tamoxifen and raloxifene was
recently launched under the auspices of the National Cancer
Institute. Some 22,000 women are expected to take part.
</P>
<P>
   In the raloxifene study, the women were tracked for a median of
40 months. Twenty-seven of the 2,576 women who were given a placebo
sugar pill were diagnosed with breast cancer compared with only 13
cases among the 5,129 women given raloxifene. The cancer rate among
the raloxifene women was the same whether they received daily doses
of 60 mg or 120 mg.
</P>
<P>
   Hot flashes, flu-like symptoms, water retention and leg cramps
were reported more frequently in the raloxifene group than in the
placebo group. There was also a higher rate of deep vein thrombosis
and pulmonary embolism, clots blocking a vein, (55 cases, or 1
percent) among the raloxifene users than in the placebo group
(eight cases, or 0.3 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The study was originally intended to determine whether a
three-year treatment with raloxifene was effective in reducing the
risk of bone fracture in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.
The results of that study will be published soon, Cummings said.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Lilly &AMP; Co., the drug company that manufactures Evista,
sponsored the study. The 7,705 participants in 180 clinical centers
across the United States and in two dozen European countries were
also monitored for breast cancer as a secondary mission of the
study, Cummings said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the participants were white. Women who had a history
of breast cancer or who were taking estrogen were excluded. The
study will now be extended with the same control group for an
additional four years to track the long-term effects of the drug.

<P>
   From New York, the city that never sleeps, to Los Angeles, the
city that never walks, after-dark shopping _ from about 9 p.m.
until as late as 2 a.m. in some cases _ is becoming more popular.
It seems to be happening in urban locations, apparently among
younger shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, shopping has become part of an evening's
entertainment, something to do between dinner out and club-hopping.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at the nocturnal shopping habits of consumers in
New York, Los Angeles and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NEW YORK &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to stores along lower Broadway like Antique
Boutique, Yellow Rat Bastard, Canal Jeans, Urban Outfitters and
Joyce Leslie, which stay open until at least 9 p.m. during the
week, retailers in surrounding neighborhoods are keeping their
doors open longer.
</P>
<P>
   Purdy Girl Lifestyle, which recently opened on LaGuardia Place
in Greenwich Village, does business until 10 p.m. from Mondays to
Wednesdays and until midnight and later, depending on the traffic,
the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
   The store, which carries apparel, accessories, cosmetics and
home accessories and caters to a young, hip customer, benefits from
its proximity to New York University and does a brisk business with
students, according to owner Corinne Purdy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are really happy to find a cool store that's open after
hours,'' said Purdy, who does much of her business between 9 p.m.
and 11 p.m. ``They are just going out to dinner or are on their way
back from the bars or going to the clubs. They may prefer to shop
at night because it's part of their night out.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdy said she has seen customers walk out as late as midnight
with complete outfits _ the same merchandise people buy during the
day. Top sellers at night are clothes by Hybrid, messenger bags,
Buddha T-shirts and aromatic candles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm working all day, I don't have time to shop,'' said
Yvonne Okoh, 21, a Colgate University physics major who was
visiting an NYU friend, as she eyed a skirt by Hybrid. ``It's great
to be able to stop in a place like this and pick up something for
the club when all the other stores are closed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the East Village and on the Lower East Side, young people
roam the streets at night looking for high-fashion vintage clothes
at the right price.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite nighttime destinations are Village Scandal on East
Seventh Street, Candy Store on Second Avenue and Marmalade on
Ludlow Street, all of which stay open late on weekends _ as long as
there are customers trickling in from neighboring bars or
restaurants. That can be as late as 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something decadent and exciting about shopping at
night,'' said Billie Madley, a co-owner of Marmalade. ``We've seen
this place turn into a sort of nightclub of shoppers.''
</P>
<P>
   Madley said her nighttime clientele is largely young, barhopping
and ready to snap up any trends in fashion. Presently, items from
the late '70s and early '80s are doing particularly well _
reconstructed denim skirts, embroidered hippie tops and dyed slips,
which range in price from $25 to $60.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LOS ANGELES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Diesel USA, located on the hip, happening Third Street
Promenade in Santa Monica, the music is groovy, the decor is cool
(mint and white) and customers are encouraged to shop till they
drop, which can be as late as 11 p.m. on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   According to manager Carol McNairy, shoppers tend to be under
30.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of couples out for dinner. They're pretty relaxed.
They mosey around and take their time. They're impulse shoppers,''
McNairy said. ``Surprisingly, we don't get a lot of returns.''
</P>
<P>
   An average Diesel outfit runs $125 to $155 for something like a
T-shirt and a pair of Walling antique dirty-denim jeans or a pair
of Kannoth cotton cargo pants with drawstrings.
</P>
<P>
   For the more fashion-hungry, there is the StyleLab section,
where a pair of polyurethane-treated linen pants is $199 and a sexy
jersey skirt and top costs $250.
</P>
<P>
   High-end sexy merchandise is the house specialty at Undercover,
another late-night destination. Beneath a chandelier and a replica
of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling is an artful selection of
lingerie, jewelry, shoes, dressy separates and dresses bearing such
labels as Plein Sud, Yigal-Azrouel and Mark Wong Nark.
</P>
<P>
   A typical outfit _ dress and shoes or dress and jewelry _ might
run $500 to $600. But Adam Shaffer, owner of Undercover, is
currently ``trying to appeal to younger girls'' by offering
lower-priced prom dresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are paying an average of $250 for slim, elegant dresses
in beautiful colors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the week his latenight customers are mostly locals _ on
weekends, they're mostly tourists, according to Shaffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's a girlfriends' night out. They've had a glass
of wine or two and it's time to play dress-up,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   One recent evening, the girlfriends were Brenda Roos, a flight
attendant, and Susan Steinman, a medical sales representative.
</P>
<P>
   Roos, an established customer, said she was shopping past
Shaffer's official closing time, which is 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll offer to stay open for me. That's just an awesome
convenience,'' she said. ``I love the atmosphere and walking up and
down the street.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``With the weather being pleasant and with less traffic in the
evening, we're always busy at night,'' according to a manager at
Urban Outfitters on M Street in Georgetown. ``This store always has
a mix of all different kinds of people shopping at night _
tourists, neighborhood people and students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always have people running in at the last minute in the
evening, picking up gifts for a party or birthday,'' the manager
said.
</P>
<P>
   Urban Outfitters is open until 10 p.m. Mondays through Fridays,
11 p.m. on Saturdays and 9 p.m. on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Allen and Kristen Cioffi jetted in from Harrisonburg, Va.,
for an evening in Georgetown. The James Madison University
undergrads made a night of it, visiting Urban Outfitters, Banana
Republic, French Connection and Kenneth Cole.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping in Georgetown at night is spectacular, the two said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nighttime shopping is getting better and better,'' said a
manager at Banana Republic. He said the bulk of customers at night
were students and young professionals who had gone to dinner, but
weren't ready to call it a night.
</P>
<P>
   Banana Republic is open until 9 p.m., Mondays through Thursdays,
until 10 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays and 8 p.m. on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The post-work crew is our prime evening customers,'' reported
a manager at the Ralph Lauren store. ``Usually they know what they
want; they've checked out the market and know what they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauren is open until 9 p.m. Mondays through Fridays and 6 p.m.
Saturdays and Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just get in the mood at night,'' Banana Republic's
manager said, noting Thursdays are traditionally the busiest for
his store, which is on the corner of Wisconsin and M Streets. ``By
9 or 10, the crowd is wall to wall. It's like daytime on Fifth
Avenue in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Huddled outside Georgetown Park Mall, Washington natives Ariel
Sutro and Stephanie Seems weren't quite sure where to head next.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you see something cool in the window at night, you're like,
`Wow! Let's go in,''' Seems explained.
</P>
<P>
   The mall is open until 9 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays and
until 6 p.m. on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Sporting a pair of just-purchased Kenneth Cole open-toed heels,
Sutro noted, ``It's pleasant and convenient to shop at night.
Especially in the nice weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Mana and Maha Yamany said they were ``too sleepy'' during
the day to brave the throngs in Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   ``After dark it's more relaxing and interesting,'' Mana said.
``We look at the clothes we want, think about it and then there's a
reason to go back.'' &QL;

 &UR; Deborah Walters, vice president, divisional merchandise manager for
cosmetics and fragrance. &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; COLOR &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We're very excited about Nars Face Glow shimmer. It makes you
look like you just came out of the sun. Also, the Guerlain
Terracotta Shiny Shine in bronze or gold imparts a healthy,
sun-kissed look. From Stila, Convertible Color tinted cream for
lips and cheeks, All Over Shimmer and Illuminating Powder
Foundation are wonderful. Trish McEvoy's Girly collection features
very natural pinks.
 &UR; SKIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of growth in the mask category, and they're
popular for a wide age group. We like Sisley Radiant Glow Express
Mask with Clays for cleansing and Express Flower Gel for hydrating,
toning and firming. We also see growth hormones as the next vitamin
C. One we especially like is Osmotics Kinetin, which is made with
plant growth hormones. We're having very good response to American
Vitamin Company, Philosophy, Christian Dior Vitalmine and Lancome
Hydra Zen. Interesting and new is Talika, an eyelash treatment
product with liposomes that claims to help grow lashes. There's
also Source Ocean nail and hand care and Danielle Netelle's
AntiDistress Lotion.
 &UR; FRAGRANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lolita Lempicka is unique and the packaging is whimsical and
really appealing. Perfumes Isabell is a huge business. We also like
Anna Sui, both in color and fragrance, and Angel Innocent.
 &UR; HAIR &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hair care is a high-growth area. Especially great is the new
Frederic Fekkai Sun Protectant Spray with shea butter and items
from Phytologie and J.F. Lazartigue.

 &UR; COLOR &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We're seeing a lot of sheer washes of color and a lot of pink. A
good example is Lancome's spring collection, Candide, which
includes trios of pastel eye shadows. We think the blue shade is
very easy to wear. Good lip glosses to try are Bobbi Brown Lip
Shine and Prescriptives Grace Lipgloss.
 &UR; SKIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We're hearing a lot about treating dull, stressed skin.
Prescriptives Vibrant brightens tired skin and gives you a rested
and healthy glow, as does the Shiseido Bioperformance Clarifying
Essence. Lancome Hydra Zen corrects skin imbalances caused by
stress.

</P>
<P>
   The big trend is a blushed and dewy face with natural-toned
lips. Bronzers continue to be very important and our favorite
bronzers include Guerlain Terracotta and Bobbi Brown Bronze Sticks.
For a natural and fresh look, we like Chantecaille Real Skin cream
foundation. As for color, Paula Dorf lip glosses in soft pinks are
nice, as is Laura Mercier's new powder blush in Cedar Rose.
 &UR; SKIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Simple regimes are important for skin, with an emphasis on
products rich in nutrients. We like Estee Lauder Renutriv Intensive
Lift Body Creme, which is chock-full of goodies that firm and
moisturize the body. Others that we like, and that are exclusive to
Bergdorf Goodman, include Jo Malone Skincare and Leanne Hirsh
Skincare with marine extracts.
 &UR; FRAGRANCE &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   Fragrances are becoming more full-bodied. Some that we like
include Geoffrey Beene, S.T. DuPont, Fable and Lucien LeLong, whose
flacon incorporates a working timepiece.

<P>
   One of the strongest messages is the color pink, from pink
mascara to a pink face shimmer from Bobbi Brown that's exclusive to
Neiman Marcus. Versace has a new foundation that's beautiful. It
looks like a really expensive jar of cream. The Versace mascara is
also a really good product.
 &UR; SKIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We're very excited about technology in skin care, especially
from Awake. People are also adding serums to their routines,
particularly from ReVive, La Prairie and Creme de la Mer. Also
important in skin care are Eve Lom Dynamite Lotion, Sisley's masks
and Lancome Oligo Minerale, exclusive to Neiman Marcus in the U.S.
 &UR; FRAGRANCE &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   We're really excited about Fresh, including its Index and Life
fragrances, and about Creed.

   Pink will carry us through the summer, as will shine around the
eyes and around the face. Our Trish McEvoy business continues to
grow, especially her beauty ``planners.'' Laura Mercier's Secret
Camouflage concealer is her best-selling product.
 &UR; SKIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We're so excited about the Mario Badescu skin-care line. It has
minimal packaging and is really basic, but it works. It has an
incredible cult following in New York, and it's our No. 1 requested
skin-care line. Also exciting are Recipes for the Skin treatment
products and the Bliss Spa dine.
 &UR; BODY &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   Bloom products from Natalie Bloom, a young Australian

   Last season's berry thing is gone and the glitter thing is gone.
Instead, there's lots of shimmer, such as the Stila All Over
Shimmer. Nars Galaxy Girl lipstick and Stila Kitten eye shadow are
shot with gold and give a very warm look for summer. A line that I
know will do very well is T. LeClerc. It's very sophisticated and
the packaging is gorgeous. Body &AMP; Soul's lip glosses are amazing _
really shiny, but they don't move around _ and their loose powder
is really nice. Also exciting is the Anna Sui color collection and
Origins As Good As It Gets.

   Even with no new product introductions, Kiehl's never seems to
stop. We're doing incredibly well with the oxygen and sun

 By THE EDITORS OF WWD 
 c.1999 Fairchild Publications  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   From New York, the city that never sleeps, to Los Angeles, the
city that never walks, after-dark shopping _ from about 9 p.m.
until as late as 2 a.m. in some cases _ is becoming more popular.
It seems to be happening in urban locations, apparently among
younger shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, shopping has become part of an evening's
entertainment, something to do between dinner out and club-hopping.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at the nocturnal shopping habits of consumers in
New York, Los Angeles and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NEW YORK &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to stores along lower Broadway like Antique
Boutique, Yellow Rat Bastard, Canal Jeans, Urban Outfitters and
Joyce Leslie, which stay open until at least 9 p.m. during the
week, retailers in surrounding neighborhoods are keeping their
doors open longer.
</P>
<P>
   Purdy Girl Lifestyle, which recently opened on LaGuardia Place
in Greenwich Village, does business until 10 p.m. from Mondays to
Wednesdays and until midnight and later, depending on the traffic,
the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
   The store, which carries apparel, accessories, cosmetics and
home accessories and caters to a young, hip customer, benefits from
its proximity to New York University and does a brisk business with
students, according to owner Corinne Purdy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are really happy to find a cool store that's open after
hours,'' said Purdy, who does much of her business between 9 p.m.
and 11 p.m. ``They are just going out to dinner or are on their way
back from the bars or going to the clubs. They may prefer to shop
at night because it's part of their night out.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdy said she has seen customers walk out as late as midnight
with complete outfits _ the same merchandise people buy during the
day. Top sellers at night are clothes by Hybrid, messenger bags,
Buddha T-shirts and aromatic candles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm working all day, I don't have time to shop,'' said
Yvonne Okoh, 21, a Colgate University physics major who was
visiting an NYU friend, as she eyed a skirt by Hybrid. ``It's great
to be able to stop in a place like this and pick up something for
the club when all the other stores are closed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the East Village and on the Lower East Side, young people
roam the streets at night looking for high-fashion vintage clothes
at the right price.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite nighttime destinations are Village Scandal on East
Seventh Street, Candy Store on Second Avenue and Marmalade on
Ludlow Street, all of which stay open late on weekends _ as long as
there are customers trickling in from neighboring bars or
restaurants. That can be as late as 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something decadent and exciting about shopping at
night,'' said Billie Madley, a co-owner of Marmalade. ``We've seen
this place turn into a sort of nightclub of shoppers.''
</P>
<P>
   Madley said her nighttime clientele is largely young, barhopping
and ready to snap up any trends in fashion. Presently, items from
the late '70s and early '80s are doing particularly well _
reconstructed denim skirts, embroidered hippie tops and dyed slips,
which range in price from $25 to $60.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LOS ANGELES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Diesel USA, located on the hip, happening Third Street
Promenade in Santa Monica, the music is groovy, the decor is cool
(mint and white) and customers are encouraged to shop till they
drop, which can be as late as 11 p.m. on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   According to manager Carol McNairy, shoppers tend to be under
30.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of couples out for dinner. They're pretty relaxed.
They mosey around and take their time. They're impulse shoppers,''
McNairy said. ``Surprisingly, we don't get a lot of returns.''
</P>
<P>
   An average Diesel outfit runs $125 to $155 for something like a
T-shirt and a pair of Walling antique dirty-denim jeans or a pair
of Kannoth cotton cargo pants with drawstrings.
</P>
<P>
   For the more fashion-hungry, there is the StyleLab section,
where a pair of polyurethane-treated linen pants is $199 and a sexy
jersey skirt and top costs $250.
</P>
<P>
   High-end sexy merchandise is the house specialty at Undercover,
another late-night destination. Beneath a chandelier and a replica
of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling is an artful selection of
lingerie, jewelry, shoes, dressy separates and dresses bearing such
labels as Plein Sud, Yigal-Azrouel and Mark Wong Nark.
</P>
<P>
   A typical outfit _ dress and shoes or dress and jewelry _ might
run $500 to $600. But Adam Shaffer, owner of Undercover, is
currently ``trying to appeal to younger girls'' by offering
lower-priced prom dresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are paying an average of $250 for slim, elegant dresses
in beautiful colors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the week his latenight customers are mostly locals _ on
weekends, they're mostly tourists, according to Shaffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's a girlfriends' night out. They've had a glass
of wine or two and it's time to play dress-up,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   One recent evening, the girlfriends were Brenda Roos, a flight
attendant, and Susan Steinman, a medical sales representative.
</P>
<P>
   Roos, an established customer, said she was shopping past
Shaffer's official closing time, which is 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll offer to stay open for me. That's just an awesome
convenience,'' she said. ``I love the atmosphere and walking up and
down the street.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``With the weather being pleasant and with less traffic in the
evening, we're always busy at night,'' according to a manager at
Urban Outfitters on M Street in Georgetown. ``This store always has
a mix of all different kinds of people shopping at night _
tourists, neighborhood people and students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always have people running in at the last minute in the
evening, picking up gifts for a party or birthday,'' the manager
said.
</P>
<P>
   Urban Outfitters is open until 10 p.m. Mondays through Fridays,
11 p.m. on Saturdays and 9 p.m. on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Allen and Kristen Cioffi jetted in from Harrisonburg, Va.,
for an evening in Georgetown. The James Madison University
undergrads made a night of it, visiting Urban Outfitters, Banana
Republic, French Connection and Kenneth Cole.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping in Georgetown at night is spectacular, the two said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nighttime shopping is getting better and better,'' said a
manager at Banana Republic. He said the bulk of customers at night
were students and young professionals who had gone to dinner, but
weren't ready to call it a night.
</P>
<P>
   Banana Republic is open until 9 p.m., Mondays through Thursdays,
until 10 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays and 8 p.m. on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The post-work crew is our prime evening customers,'' reported
a manager at the Ralph Lauren store. ``Usually they know what they
want; they've checked out the market and know what they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauren is open until 9 p.m. Mondays through Fridays and 6 p.m.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   From New York, the city that never sleeps, to Los Angeles, the
city that never walks, after-dark shopping _ from about 9 p.m.
until as late as 2 a.m. in some cases _ is becoming more popular.
It seems to be happening in urban locations, apparently among
younger shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, shopping has become part of an evening's
entertainment, something to do between dinner out and club-hopping.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at the nocturnal shopping habits of consumers in
New York, Los Angeles and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NEW YORK &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to stores along lower Broadway like Antique
Boutique, Yellow Rat Bastard, Canal Jeans, Urban Outfitters and
Joyce Leslie, which stay open until at least 9 p.m. during the
week, retailers in surrounding neighborhoods are keeping their
doors open longer.
</P>
<P>
   Purdy Girl Lifestyle, which recently opened on LaGuardia Place
in Greenwich Village, does business until 10 p.m. from Mondays to
Wednesdays and until midnight and later, depending on the traffic,
the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
   The store, which carries apparel, accessories, cosmetics and
home accessories and caters to a young, hip customer, benefits from
its proximity to New York University and does a brisk business with
students, according to owner Corinne Purdy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are really happy to find a cool store that's open after
hours,'' said Purdy, who does much of her business between 9 p.m.
and 11 p.m. ``They are just going out to dinner or are on their way
back from the bars or going to the clubs. They may prefer to shop
at night because it's part of their night out.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdy said she has seen customers walk out as late as midnight
with complete outfits _ the same merchandise people buy during the
day. Top sellers at night are clothes by Hybrid, messenger bags,
Buddha T-shirts and aromatic candles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm working all day, I don't have time to shop,'' said
Yvonne Okoh, 21, a Colgate University physics major who was
visiting an NYU friend, as she eyed a skirt by Hybrid. ``It's great
to be able to stop in a place like this and pick up something for
the club when all the other stores are closed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the East Village and on the Lower East Side, young people
roam the streets at night looking for high-fashion vintage clothes
at the right price.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite nighttime destinations are Village Scandal on East
Seventh Street, Candy Store on Second Avenue and Marmalade on
Ludlow Street, all of which stay open late on weekends _ as long as
there are customers trickling in from neighboring bars or
restaurants. That can be as late as 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something decadent and exciting about shopping at
night,'' said Billie Madley, a co-owner of Marmalade. ``We've seen
this place turn into a sort of nightclub of shoppers.''
</P>
<P>
   Madley said her nighttime clientele is largely young, barhopping
and ready to snap up any trends in fashion. Presently, items from
the late '70s and early '80s are doing particularly well _
reconstructed denim skirts, embroidered hippie tops and dyed slips,
which range in price from $25 to $60.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LOS ANGELES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Diesel USA, located on the hip, happening Third Street
Promenade in Santa Monica, the music is groovy, the decor is cool
(mint and white) and customers are encouraged to shop till they
drop, which can be as late as 11 p.m. on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   According to manager Carol McNairy, shoppers tend to be under
30.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of couples out for dinner. They're pretty relaxed.
They mosey around and take their time. They're impulse shoppers,''
McNairy said. ``Surprisingly, we don't get a lot of returns.''
</P>
<P>
   An average Diesel outfit runs $125 to $155 for something like a
T-shirt and a pair of Walling antique dirty-denim jeans or a pair
of Kannoth cotton cargo pants with drawstrings.
</P>
<P>
   For the more fashion-hungry, there is the StyleLab section,
where a pair of polyurethane-treated linen pants is $199 and a sexy
jersey skirt and top costs $250.
</P>
<P>
   High-end sexy merchandise is the house specialty at Undercover,
another late-night destination. Beneath a chandelier and a replica
of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling is an artful selection of
lingerie, jewelry, shoes, dressy separates and dresses bearing such
labels as Plein Sud, Yigal-Azrouel and Mark Wong Nark.
</P>
<P>
   A typical outfit _ dress and shoes or dress and jewelry _ might
run $500 to $600. But Adam Shaffer, owner of Undercover, is
currently ``trying to appeal to younger girls'' by offering
lower-priced prom dresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are paying an average of $250 for slim, elegant dresses
in beautiful colors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the week his latenight customers are mostly locals _ on
weekends, they're mostly tourists, according to Shaffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's a girlfriends' night out. They've had a glass
of wine or two and it's time to play dress-up,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   One recent evening, the girlfriends were Brenda Roos, a flight
attendant, and Susan Steinman, a medical sales representative.
</P>
<P>
   Roos, an established customer, said she was shopping past
Shaffer's official closing time, which is 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll offer to stay open for me. That's just an awesome
convenience,'' she said. ``I love the atmosphere and walking up and
down the street.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``With the weather being pleasant and with less traffic in the
evening, we're always busy at night,'' according to a manager at
Urban Outfitters on M Street in Georgetown. ``This store always has
a mix of all different kinds of people shopping at night _
tourists, neighborhood people and students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always have people running in at the last minute in the
evening, picking up gifts for a party or birthday,'' the manager
said.
</P>
<P>
   Urban Outfitters is open until 10 p.m. Mondays through Fridays,
11 p.m. on Saturdays and 9 p.m. on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Allen and Kristen Cioffi jetted in from Harrisonburg, Va.,
for an evening in Georgetown. The James Madison University
undergrads made a night of it, visiting Urban Outfitters, Banana
Republic, French Connection and Kenneth Cole.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping in Georgetown at night is spectacular, the two said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nighttime shopping is getting better and better,'' said a
manager at Banana Republic. He said the bulk of customers at night
were students and young professionals who had gone to dinner, but
weren't ready to call it a night.
</P>
<P>
   Banana Republic is open until 9 p.m., Mondays through Thursdays,
until 10 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays and 8 p.m. on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The post-work crew is our prime evening customers,'' reported
a manager at the Ralph Lauren store. ``Usually they know what they
want; they've checked out the market and know what they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauren is open until 9 p.m. Mondays through Fridays and 6 p.m.
Saturdays and Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just get in the mood at night,'' Banana Republic's

   KOSOVO-MAIN _ MORINI, Albania _ Thousands of Kosovar Albanian
refugees, despite NATO warnings about landmines and boobie trapped
houses, are crossing the border here to return to their homes in
Kosovo. The Yugoslav withdrawal from the zone extending from
Pristina to the southern border was largely completed by its
midnight deadline, except for isolated cases of soldiers in
broken-down vehicles. NATO gave the Serbs anouther 24 hours.
Meanwhile, U.S. and Russian foreign and defense ministers meet in
Helsinki to hammer out Russia's role in Kosovo peacekeeping.

   KOSOVO-MASSACRE _ KORENICA, Yugoslavia _ It is likely the worst
massacre of the Serb ethnic cleansing campaign. Mark Barishe died
because he couldn't drive a tractor. Vengeful Serb troops were
going to let the 68-year-old man get away. But when he told them
that he couldn't drive a tractor, they took him back into his house
with five others, lined them up against the bedroom wall. ``Aren't
you people too,'' he pleaded. But when the Catholic Albanian began
to cross his heart, a Serb soldier said, ``It's too late for you
now.'' And now five charred bodies mark the most gruesome scene
from a rampage in which up to 300 Kosovar Albanians were massacred
to avenge the death of five Serb policemen. (Kaplow, Atlanta

   KOSOVO-DEATHS _ KUKES, Albania _ Peace did not come soon enough
for Halil Emini. He did not get killed by Yugoslav forces or NATO
bombs. He just drowned last Friday while swimming with his children
near their refugee camp. Now, instead of planning a return to his
homeland as many are Tuesday, Emini lies under a mound of dirt on a
plateau with 140 other deceased ethnic Albanians who fled Kosovo
during the Serbs' ethnic cleansing campaign. (Kaplow, Cox News

   COKE-REACT _ GENT, Belgium _ Talk about an image problem.
Coca-Cola Co., the Atlanta-based soft drink giant, couldn't have
picked a worse time to endure the embarrasing exposure of Belgium's
ban on its products because of concerns about its safety. Europeans
are growing increasingly worried about the wholesomeness of the
food and beverages they eat and drink after a series of highly
publicized episodes ranging from mad cow disease to genetically
modified foods _ known in Britain as Frankenstein foods. This

after serving 16 years on a rape charge, rode in a limousine
Wednesday and spent his first day of freedom getting attention from
the media, five to 10 job offers and a solicitation of at least one
date. Johnson appeared Wednesday on a morning TV show and says he
might appear on Johnnie Cochran's talk show. Johnson, who says he's
not bitter, was convicted by an all-white jury. ``Everyone was
white,'' he said. ``It's hard for them to picture me as anything

   HITCHED _ Alabama's chain gangs are gone. But prison hitching
posts _ which trace their history to pillors and stockades _ may be
back. They're not used anywhere else in the country. Endorsed by
Gov. Don Siegelman, Alabama prison commissioner Mike Haley argued
in federal court this week to reinstate the practice of shackling
inmates who refused to work to hitching posts, horizontal metal
bars placed at 50 inches and 45 inches above the ground, to
accommodate inmates of different heights. Today in a conference
call with U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson, attorneys from the
Southern Poverty Law Center, representing five inmates, and the
state corrections department will discuss remaining legal
arguments. While Thompson contemplates his decision, the hitching
posts remain unused. Alabama has had a checked past with its
prisons. Feds took over the system in 1979 after prisoner abuse.

   FLA-CHILLINGWORTH-MURDERS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The voice of
the murdered man can be heard today, rising as if from the very
depths of the silent ocean. What are perhaps the victim's last
written words are hastily scribbled in pencil, on the back of a
legal brief, which lies this morning on a table under lamplight at
the Palm Beach Historical Society. It is the voice of Judge C.E.
Chillingworth, abducted with his wife 44 years ago, June 15, 1955,
from a seaside bungalow in Manalapan. The judge, 58, and his wife,
Marjorie, 47, were bound, weighted and forced overboard, alive, two
miles out to sea, by two assassins hired by a fellow judge who
hated and feared Chillingworth. (Browning, Palm Beach Post) 54

   BLACK-SEMINOLES _ AUSTIN, Texas _ It was an archaeological
project in a South Texas town that led University of Texas
anthropologist Shirley Mock to a little-known community. A golf
course and houses were being planned in a section of Brackettville,
but before construction could start, the land had to be excavated
excavation for any culturally significant items. And as part of the
project, Mock was hired to interview the older people who lived
near the site. Those initial talks led to more in-depth
ethnological interviews and years of research into the black
Seminoles of Texas and Mexico. ``Singing to the Ancestors: Black
Seminoles on the Border'' is the culmination of Mock's five-year
scholarly investigation. The multimedia exhibit explores the search
for freedom and the building of a culture among a group that formed
in the early 1800s, when runaway slaves took shelter with the
Seminole Indians in Florida. (Martin, Austin American-Statesman)

The ``Safe Harbor'' program, which began at Pinehurst No. 2, has

Sandhills _ including nine golf courses _ and is being rolled out
as a national model. (Burritt, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED

   Below, top retailers cite the hottest beauty products on
counters near you _ and they named names. The consensus? Low-key
pretty is the favored beauty philosophy. And don't forget the color
pink and skin care that puts you at ease.

   &UR; SAKS FIFTH AVENUE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; Deborah Walters, vice president, divisional merchandise manager for
cosmetics and fragrance. &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; COLOR &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We're very excited about Nars Face Glow shimmer. It makes you
look like you just came out of the sun. Also, the Guerlain
Terracotta Shiny Shine in bronze or gold imparts a healthy,
sun-kissed look. From Stila, Convertible Color tinted cream for
lips and cheeks, All Over Shimmer and Illuminating Powder
Foundation are wonderful. Trish McEvoy's Girly collection features
very natural pinks.
 &UR; SKIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of growth in the mask category, and they're
popular for a wide age group. We like Sisley Radiant Glow Express
Mask with Clays for cleansing and Express Flower Gel for hydrating,
toning and firming. We also see growth hormones as the next vitamin
C. One we especially like is Osmotics Kinetin, which is made with
plant growth hormones. We're having very good response to American
Vitamin Company, Philosophy, Christian Dior Vitalmine and Lancome
Hydra Zen. Interesting and new is Talika, an eyelash treatment
product with liposomes that claims to help grow lashes. There's
also Source Ocean nail and hand care and Danielle Netelle's
AntiDistress Lotion.
 &UR; FRAGRANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lolita Lempicka is unique and the packaging is whimsical and
really appealing. Perfumes Isabell is a huge business. We also like
Anna Sui, both in color and fragrance, and Angel Innocent.
 &UR; HAIR &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hair care is a high-growth area. Especially great is the new
Frederic Fekkai Sun Protectant Spray with shea butter and items
from Phytologie and J.F. Lazartigue.

   We're seeing a lot of sheer washes of color and a lot of pink. A
good example is Lancome's spring collection, Candide, which
includes trios of pastel eye shadows. We think the blue shade is
very easy to wear. Good lip glosses to try are Bobbi Brown Lip
Shine and Prescriptives Grace Lipgloss.

   The big trend is a blushed and dewy face with natural-toned

For a natural and fresh look, we like Chantecaille Real Skin cream

nice, as is Laura Mercier's new powder blush in Cedar Rose.

   Simple regimes are important for skin, with an emphasis on

Skincare with marine extracts.

   One of the strongest messages is the color pink, from pink

looks like a really expensive jar of cream. The Versace mascara is
also a really good product.

and Lancome Oligo Minerale, exclusive to Neiman Marcus in the U.S.

   Below, top retailers cite the hottest beauty products on
counters near you _ and they named names. The consensus? Low-key
pretty is the favored beauty philosophy. And don't forget the color
pink and skin care that puts you at ease.

   We're very excited about Nars Face Glow shimmer. It makes you
look like you just came out of the sun. Also, the Guerlain
Terracotta Shiny Shine in bronze or gold imparts a healthy,
sun-kissed look. From Stila, Convertible Color tinted cream for
lips and cheeks, All Over Shimmer and Illuminating Powder
Foundation are wonderful. Trish McEvoy's Girly collection features
very natural pinks.
 &UR; SKIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of growth in the mask category, and they're
popular for a wide age group. We like Sisley Radiant Glow Express
Mask with Clays for cleansing and Express Flower Gel for hydrating,
toning and firming. We also see growth hormones as the next vitamin
C. One we especially like is Osmotics Kinetin, which is made with
plant growth hormones. We're having very good response to American
Vitamin Company, Philosophy, Christian Dior Vitalmine and Lancome
Hydra Zen. Interesting and new is Talika, an eyelash treatment
product with liposomes that claims to help grow lashes. There's
also Source Ocean nail and hand care and Danielle Netelle's
AntiDistress Lotion.
 &UR; FRAGRANCE &LR;  &QL;

   Lolita Lempicka is unique and the packaging is whimsical and

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   From New York, the city that never sleeps, to Los Angeles, the
city that never walks, after-dark shopping _ from about 9 p.m.
until as late as 2 a.m. in some cases _ is becoming more popular.
It seems to be happening in urban locations, apparently among
younger shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, shopping has become part of an evening's
entertainment, something to do between dinner out and club-hopping.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at the nocturnal shopping habits of consumers in
New York, Los Angeles and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NEW YORK &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to stores along lower Broadway like Antique
Boutique, Yellow Rat Bastard, Canal Jeans, Urban Outfitters and
Joyce Leslie, which stay open until at least 9 p.m. during the
week, retailers in surrounding neighborhoods are keeping their
doors open longer.
</P>
<P>
   Purdy Girl Lifestyle, which recently opened on LaGuardia Place
in Greenwich Village, does business until 10 p.m. from Mondays to
Wednesdays and until midnight and later, depending on the traffic,
the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
   The store, which carries apparel, accessories, cosmetics and
home accessories and caters to a young, hip customer, benefits from
its proximity to New York University and does a brisk business with
students, according to owner Corinne Purdy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are really happy to find a cool store that's open after
hours,'' said Purdy, who does much of her business between 9 p.m.
and 11 p.m. ``They are just going out to dinner or are on their way
back from the bars or going to the clubs. They may prefer to shop
at night because it's part of their night out.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdy said she has seen customers walk out as late as midnight
with complete outfits _ the same merchandise people buy during the
day. Top sellers at night are clothes by Hybrid, messenger bags,
Buddha T-shirts and aromatic candles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm working all day, I don't have time to shop,'' said
Yvonne Okoh, 21, a Colgate University physics major who was
visiting an NYU friend, as she eyed a skirt by Hybrid. ``It's great
to be able to stop in a place like this and pick up something for
the club when all the other stores are closed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the East Village and on the Lower East Side, young people
roam the streets at night looking for high-fashion vintage clothes
at the right price.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite nighttime destinations are Village Scandal on East
Seventh Street, Candy Store on Second Avenue and Marmalade on
Ludlow Street, all of which stay open late on weekends _ as long as
there are customers trickling in from neighboring bars or
restaurants. That can be as late as 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something decadent and exciting about shopping at
night,'' said Billie Madley, a co-owner of Marmalade. ``We've seen
this place turn into a sort of nightclub of shoppers.''
</P>
<P>
   Madley said her nighttime clientele is largely young, barhopping
and ready to snap up any trends in fashion. Presently, items from
the late '70s and early '80s are doing particularly well _
reconstructed denim skirts, embroidered hippie tops and dyed slips,
which range in price from $25 to $60.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LOS ANGELES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Diesel USA, located on the hip, happening Third Street
Promenade in Santa Monica, the music is groovy, the decor is cool
(mint and white) and customers are encouraged to shop till they
drop, which can be as late as 11 p.m. on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   According to manager Carol McNairy, shoppers tend to be under
30.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of couples out for dinner. They're pretty relaxed.
They mosey around and take their time. They're impulse shoppers,''
McNairy said. ``Surprisingly, we don't get a lot of returns.''
</P>
<P>
   An average Diesel outfit runs $125 to $155 for something like a
T-shirt and a pair of Walling antique dirty-denim jeans or a pair
of Kannoth cotton cargo pants with drawstrings.
</P>
<P>
   For the more fashion-hungry, there is the StyleLab section,
where a pair of polyurethane-treated linen pants is $199 and a sexy
jersey skirt and top costs $250.
</P>
<P>
   High-end sexy merchandise is the house specialty at Undercover,
another late-night destination. Beneath a chandelier and a replica
of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling is an artful selection of
lingerie, jewelry, shoes, dressy separates and dresses bearing such
labels as Plein Sud, Yigal-Azrouel and Mark Wong Nark.
</P>
<P>
   A typical outfit _ dress and shoes or dress and jewelry _ might
run $500 to $600. But Adam Shaffer, owner of Undercover, is
currently ``trying to appeal to younger girls'' by offering
lower-priced prom dresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are paying an average of $250 for slim, elegant dresses
in beautiful colors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the week his latenight customers are mostly locals _ on
weekends, they're mostly tourists, according to Shaffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's a girlfriends' night out. They've had a glass
of wine or two and it's time to play dress-up,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   One recent evening, the girlfriends were Brenda Roos, a flight
attendant, and Susan Steinman, a medical sales representative.
</P>
<P>
   Roos, an established customer, said she was shopping past
Shaffer's official closing time, which is 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll offer to stay open for me. That's just an awesome
convenience,'' she said. ``I love the atmosphere and walking up and
down the street.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``With the weather being pleasant and with less traffic in the
evening, we're always busy at night,'' according to a manager at
Urban Outfitters on M Street in Georgetown. ``This store always has
a mix of all different kinds of people shopping at night _
tourists, neighborhood people and students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always have people running in at the last minute in the
evening, picking up gifts for a party or birthday,'' the manager
said.
</P>
<P>
   Urban Outfitters is open until 10 p.m. Mondays through Fridays,
11 p.m. on Saturdays and 9 p.m. on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Allen and Kristen Cioffi jetted in from Harrisonburg, Va.,
for an evening in Georgetown. The James Madison University
undergrads made a night of it, visiting Urban Outfitters, Banana
Republic, French Connection and Kenneth Cole.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping in Georgetown at night is spectacular, the two said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nighttime shopping is getting better and better,'' said a
manager at Banana Republic. He said the bulk of customers at night
were students and young professionals who had gone to dinner, but
weren't ready to call it a night.
</P>
<P>
   Banana Republic is open until 9 p.m., Mondays through Thursdays,
until 10 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays and 8 p.m. on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The post-work crew is our prime evening customers,'' reported
a manager at the Ralph Lauren store. ``Usually they know what they
want; they've checked out the market and know what they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauren is open until 9 p.m. Mondays through Fridays and 6 p.m.
Saturdays and Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just get in the mood at night,'' Banana Republic's
manager said, noting Thursdays are traditionally the busiest for
his store, which is on the corner of Wisconsin and M Streets. ``By
9 or 10, the crowd is wall to wall. It's like daytime on Fifth
Avenue in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Huddled outside Georgetown Park Mall, Washington natives Ariel
Sutro and Stephanie Seems weren't quite sure where to head next.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you see something cool in the window at night, you're like,
`Wow! Let's go in,''' Seems explained.
</P>
<P>
   The mall is open until 9 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays and
until 6 p.m. on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Sporting a pair of just-purchased Kenneth Cole open-toed heels,
Sutro noted, ``It's pleasant and convenient to shop at night.
Especially in the nice weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Mana and Maha Yamany said they were ``too sleepy'' during
the day to brave the throngs in Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   ``After dark it's more relaxing and interesting,'' Mana said.
``We look at the clothes we want, think about it and then there's a
reason to go back.'' &QL;

Joyce Leslie, which stay open until at least 9 p.m. during the
week, retailers in surrounding neighborhoods are keeping their
doors open longer.
</P>
<P>
   Purdy Girl Lifestyle, which recently opened on LaGuardia Place
in Greenwich Village, does business until 10 p.m. from Mondays to
Wednesdays and until midnight and later, depending on the traffic,
the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
   The store, which carries apparel, accessories, cosmetics and
home accessories and caters to a young, hip customer, benefits from
its proximity to New York University and does a brisk business with
students, according to owner Corinne Purdy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are really happy to find a cool store that's open after
hours,'' said Purdy, who does much of her business between 9 p.m.
and 11 p.m. ``They are just going out to dinner or are on their way
back from the bars or going to the clubs. They may prefer to shop
at night because it's part of their night out.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdy said she has seen customers walk out as late as midnight
with complete outfits _ the same merchandise people buy during the
day. Top sellers at night are clothes by Hybrid, messenger bags,
Buddha T-shirts and aromatic candles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm working all day, I don't have time to shop,'' said
Yvonne Okoh, 21, a Colgate University physics major who was
visiting an NYU friend, as she eyed a skirt by Hybrid. ``It's great
to be able to stop in a place like this and pick up something for
the club when all the other stores are closed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the East Village and on the Lower East Side, young people
roam the streets at night looking for high-fashion vintage clothes
at the right price.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite nighttime destinations are Village Scandal on East
Seventh Street, Candy Store on Second Avenue and Marmalade on
Ludlow Street, all of which stay open late on weekends _ as long as
there are customers trickling in from neighboring bars or
restaurants. That can be as late as 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something decadent and exciting about shopping at
night,'' said Billie Madley, a co-owner of Marmalade. ``We've seen
this place turn into a sort of nightclub of shoppers.''
</P>
<P>
   Madley said her nighttime clientele is largely young, barhopping
and ready to snap up any trends in fashion. Presently, items from
the late '70s and early '80s are doing particularly well _
reconstructed denim skirts, embroidered hippie tops and dyed slips,
which range in price from $25 to $60.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LOS ANGELES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Diesel USA, located on the hip, happening Third Street
Promenade in Santa Monica, the music is groovy, the decor is cool
(mint and white) and customers are encouraged to shop till they
drop, which can be as late as 11 p.m. on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   According to manager Carol McNairy, shoppers tend to be under
30.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of couples out for dinner. They're pretty relaxed.
They mosey around and take their time. They're impulse shoppers,''
McNairy said. ``Surprisingly, we don't get a lot of returns.''
</P>
<P>
   An average Diesel outfit runs $125 to $155 for something like a
T-shirt and a pair of Walling antique dirty-denim jeans or a pair
of Kannoth cotton cargo pants with drawstrings.
</P>
<P>
   For the more fashion-hungry, there is the StyleLab section,
where a pair of polyurethane-treated linen pants is $199 and a sexy
jersey skirt and top costs $250.
</P>
<P>
   High-end sexy merchandise is the house specialty at Undercover,
another late-night destination. Beneath a chandelier and a replica
of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling is an artful selection of
lingerie, jewelry, shoes, dressy separates and dresses bearing such
labels as Plein Sud, Yigal-Azrouel and Mark Wong Nark.
</P>
<P>
   A typical outfit _ dress and shoes or dress and jewelry _ might
run $500 to $600. But Adam Shaffer, owner of Undercover, is
currently ``trying to appeal to younger girls'' by offering
lower-priced prom dresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are paying an average of $250 for slim, elegant dresses
in beautiful colors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the week his latenight customers are mostly locals _ on
weekends, they're mostly tourists, according to Shaffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's a girlfriends' night out. They've had a glass
of wine or two and it's time to play dress-up,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   One recent evening, the girlfriends were Brenda Roos, a flight
attendant, and Susan Steinman, a medical sales representative.
</P>
<P>
   Roos, an established customer, said she was shopping past
Shaffer's official closing time, which is 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll offer to stay open for me. That's just an awesome
convenience,'' she said. ``I love the atmosphere and walking up and
down the street.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``With the weather being pleasant and with less traffic in the
evening, we're always busy at night,'' according to a manager at
Urban Outfitters on M Street in Georgetown. ``This store always has
a mix of all different kinds of people shopping at night _
tourists, neighborhood people and students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always have people running in at the last minute in the
evening, picking up gifts for a party or birthday,'' the manager
said.
</P>
<P>
   Urban Outfitters is open until 10 p.m. Mondays through Fridays,
11 p.m. on Saturdays and 9 p.m. on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Allen and Kristen Cioffi jetted in from Harrisonburg, Va.,
for an evening in Georgetown. The James Madison University
undergrads made a night of it, visiting Urban Outfitters, Banana
Republic, French Connection and Kenneth Cole.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping in Georgetown at night is spectacular, the two said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nighttime shopping is getting better and better,'' said a
manager at Banana Republic. He said the bulk of customers at night
were students and young professionals who had gone to dinner, but
weren't ready to call it a night.
</P>
<P>
   Banana Republic is open until 9 p.m., Mondays through Thursdays,
until 10 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays and 8 p.m. on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The post-work crew is our prime evening customers,'' reported
a manager at the Ralph Lauren store. ``Usually they know what they
want; they've checked out the market and know what they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauren is open until 9 p.m. Mondays through Fridays and 6 p.m.
Saturdays and Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just get in the mood at night,'' Banana Republic's
manager said, noting Thursdays are traditionally the busiest for
his store, which is on the corner of Wisconsin and M Streets. ``By
9 or 10, the crowd is wall to wall. It's like daytime on Fifth
Avenue in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Huddled outside Georgetown Park Mall, Washington natives Ariel
Sutro and Stephanie Seems weren't quite sure where to head next.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you see something cool in the window at night, you're like,
`Wow! Let's go in,''' Seems explained.
</P>
<P>
   The mall is open until 9 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays and
until 6 p.m. on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Sporting a pair of just-purchased Kenneth Cole open-toed heels,
Sutro noted, ``It's pleasant and convenient to shop at night.
Especially in the nice weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Mana and Maha Yamany said they were ``too sleepy'' during
the day to brave the throngs in Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   ``After dark it's more relaxing and interesting,'' Mana said.
``We look at the clothes we want, think about it and then there's a
reason to go back.'' &QL;

   Below, top retailers cite the hottest beauty products on
counters near you _ and they named names. The consensus? Low-key
pretty is the favored beauty philosophy. And don't forget the color
pink and skin care that puts you at ease.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SAKS FIFTH AVENUE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; Deborah Walters, vice president, divisional merchandise manager for
cosmetics and fragrance. &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; COLOR &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We're very excited about Nars Face Glow shimmer. It makes you
look like you just came out of the sun. Also, the Guerlain
Terracotta Shiny Shine in bronze or gold imparts a healthy,
sun-kissed look. From Stila, Convertible Color tinted cream for
lips and cheeks, All Over Shimmer and Illuminating Powder
Foundation are wonderful. Trish McEvoy's Girly collection features
very natural pinks.
 &UR; SKIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of growth in the mask category, and they're
popular for a wide age group. We like Sisley Radiant Glow Express
Mask with Clays for cleansing and Express Flower Gel for hydrating,
toning and firming. We also see growth hormones as the next vitamin
C. One we especially like is Osmotics Kinetin, which is made with
plant growth hormones. We're having very good response to American
Vitamin Company, Philosophy, Christian Dior Vitalmine and Lancome
Hydra Zen. Interesting and new is Talika, an eyelash treatment
product with liposomes that claims to help grow lashes. There's
also Source Ocean nail and hand care and Danielle Netelle's
AntiDistress Lotion.
 &UR; FRAGRANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lolita Lempicka is unique and the packaging is whimsical and
really appealing. Perfumes Isabell is a huge business. We also like
Anna Sui, both in color and fragrance, and Angel Innocent.
 &UR; HAIR &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hair care is a high-growth area. Especially great is the new
Frederic Fekkai Sun Protectant Spray with shea butter and items
from Phytologie and J.F. Lazartigue.

   &UR; NORDSTROM &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; Dale Crichton, executive vice president of cosmetics. &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; COLOR &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We're seeing a lot of sheer washes of color and a lot of pink. A
good example is Lancome's spring collection, Candide, which
includes trios of pastel eye shadows. We think the blue shade is
very easy to wear. Good lip glosses to try are Bobbi Brown Lip
Shine and Prescriptives Grace Lipgloss.
 &UR; SKIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We're hearing a lot about treating dull, stressed skin.
Prescriptives Vibrant brightens tired skin and gives you a rested
and healthy glow, as does the Shiseido Bioperformance Clarifying
Essence. Lancome Hydra Zen corrects skin imbalances caused by
stress.
</P>

   &UR; BERGDORF GOODMAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; Vicki Haupt, senior vice president and general merchandise
manager. &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; COLOR &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The big trend is a blushed and dewy face with natural-toned
lips. Bronzers continue to be very important and our favorite
bronzers include Guerlain Terracotta and Bobbi Brown Bronze Sticks.
For a natural and fresh look, we like Chantecaille Real Skin cream
foundation. As for color, Paula Dorf lip glosses in soft pinks are
nice, as is Laura Mercier's new powder blush in Cedar Rose.
 &UR; SKIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Simple regimes are important for skin, with an emphasis on
products rich in nutrients. We like Estee Lauder Renutriv Intensive
Lift Body Creme, which is chock-full of goodies that firm and
moisturize the body. Others that we like, and that are exclusive to
Bergdorf Goodman, include Jo Malone Skincare and Leanne Hirsh
Skincare with marine extracts.
 &UR; FRAGRANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fragrances are becoming more full-bodied. Some that we like
include Geoffrey Beene, S.T. DuPont, Fable and Lucien LeLong, whose
flacon incorporates a working timepiece.

 &UR; Leslie Faust, vice president, divisional merchandise manager of
cosmetics and fragrances. &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; COLOR &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the strongest messages is the color pink, from pink
mascara to a pink face shimmer from Bobbi Brown that's exclusive to
Neiman Marcus. Versace has a new foundation that's beautiful. It
looks like a really expensive jar of cream. The Versace mascara is
also a really good product.
 &UR; SKIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We're very excited about technology in skin care, especially
from Awake. People are also adding serums to their routines,
particularly from ReVive, La Prairie and Creme de la Mer. Also
important in skin care are Eve Lom Dynamite Lotion, Sisley's masks
and Lancome Oligo Minerale, exclusive to Neiman Marcus in the U.S.
 &UR; FRAGRANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We're really excited about Fresh, including its Index and Life
fragrances, and about Creed.

 &UR; COLOR &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pink will carry us through the summer, as will shine around the
eyes and around the face. Our Trish McEvoy business continues to
grow, especially her beauty ``planners.'' Laura Mercier's Secret
Camouflage concealer is her best-selling product.
 &UR; SKIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We're so excited about the Mario Badescu skin-care line. It has
minimal packaging and is really basic, but it works. It has an
incredible cult following in New York, and it's our No. 1 requested
skin-care line. Also exciting are Recipes for the Skin treatment
products and the Bliss Spa dine.
 &UR; BODY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bloom products from Natalie Bloom, a young Australian
entrepreneur, cover the entire gamut of color, from lip color to
crayons for cheeks. Also great are her travel items and
aromatherapy lip balms and massage oil.
 &UR; FRAGRANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   L'Artisan Parfumeur continues to be our top-selling fragrance
line. The new Comptoir Sud Pacifique fragrance, Kumquat, is a juicy
fragrance that's wonderful for summer.

</P>
<P>
   Last season's berry thing is gone and the glitter thing is gone.
Instead, there's lots of shimmer, such as the Stila All Over
Shimmer. Nars Galaxy Girl lipstick and Stila Kitten eye shadow are
shot with gold and give a very warm look for summer. A line that I
know will do very well is T. LeClerc. It's very sophisticated and
the packaging is gorgeous. Body &AMP; Soul's lip glosses are amazing _
really shiny, but they don't move around _ and their loose powder
is really nice. Also exciting is the Anna Sui color collection and
Origins As Good As It Gets.
 &UR; SKIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even with no new product introductions, Kiehl's never seems to
stop. We're doing incredibly well with the oxygen and sun
protection products from Peter Thomas Roth. Their daily moisturizer
with an SPF of 20 is nonirritating and wonderful. The whole
Philosophy line is doing great.
 &UR; FRAGRANCE &LR;  &QL;

   The Perfect Veil fragrance from Creative Sensualization smells

UNIVERSITY SEEKS TO STOP COMPANY SELLING CLASS NOTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICKI HADDOCK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Taking aim at a growing campus product, the
University of California has gone to court to stop professional
note-takers from infiltrating classrooms and peddling lecture notes
to students.
</P>
<P>
   Some student customers say that without the distractions of
having to scribble down their own notes, buying the notes actually
make them pay closer attention in class. Others simply buy the
notes and skip classes.
</P>
<P>
   The university system's lawsuit, filed in Alameda County
Superior Court, accuses the elusive R&AMP;R Corp. of making
unauthorized use of the university name, trespassing on UC campuses
to ply its trade and violating UC regulations against unauthorized
commercial activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are one very overbearing outfit,'' said Eric Behrens, a
lawyer for the state university system. ``A lot of professors have
complained, and so did the students.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit claims R&AMP;R regularly stiffs its employees and
customers, while attempting to silence critics with legal threats.
</P>
<P>
   The Berkeley and other UC campuses report that complaints began
about four years ago, when the company started taking notes at
assorted classes in the history, anthropology, chemistry, biology,
political science and economics departments.
</P>
<P>
   A judge has rejected UC's request for an immediate temporary
restraining order to halt R&AMP;R's practices. A hearing on UC's motion
for a preliminary injunction to stop R&AMP;R is scheduled for July 6.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the company, which operates under various
names, could not be reached for comment. UC lawyers say they have
been unable to locate R&AMP;R to serve it notice of the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The suit says Berkeley's Student Conduct Code prohibits ``the
selling or distributing of course lecture notes, handouts, readers
or other information provided by an instructor, or using them for
any commercial purposes without the express permission of the
instructor.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit adds that the notes, which cost between $22.95 and
$55.50 per course, are often of poor quality. One professor quoted
in the lawsuit characterized R&AMP;R's notes of his lectures as ``a
pathetic rendition.''

the pews of the Sage Memorial First Presbyterian Church in Far
Rockaway, Queens, contemplating the unsung Louis Comfort Tiffany
masterpiece with great gnarled branches. Tiffany designed stained
glass windows such as this ``Tree of Life,'' his largest landscape,

first,'' said Rybczynski, whose new book, ``A Clearing in the

TOMATO FEST: ALL THE JUICY DETAILS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can you believe it? It seems like just yesterday when it began,
and already the 15th annual Tomato Fest is history.
</P>
<P>
   It happened last weekend in Jacksonville, Texas, and we missed
it. I'm sorry.
</P>
<P>
   But if it makes you feel any better, the Battle of San Tomato
did not take place this year, making me wonder whether the 1999
version of the festival should really count in the record books.
</P>
<P>
   The Battle of San Tomato, you might already know, is when two
sides face off in the Tomato Bowl and throw tomatoes at each other.
The field slowly becomes one big, slushy mess of tomato sauce.
</P>
<P>
   If the event had occurred back at the turn of the last century,
the Battle of San Tomato would have no doubt been called the peach
pit pitch-off. Jacksonville was a leading center of peach
production in the United States. After, say, about 1915, the local
farmers switched over to tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, the town became known as ``the tomato capital of
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, it must be said, the biggest local industry is
``plastics.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the local high school football stadium is really called
the Tomato Bowl. This year, instead of hosting the Battle of San
Tomato, the festival organizers hosted a gospel concert featuring
18 groups. Not quite as exciting, but infinitely cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   The wildest event this year was the ``bucket war.'' It is an
event where the local fire departments turn on their hoses and try
to move a bucket suspended on an overhead line.
</P>
<P>
   Since the football stadium had gospel singers in it, the bucket
war had to be held in the rodeo arena.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a ``power jam.'' This is a noisy event in which
individuals crank up their car stereos to see who could jam the
loudest. A common occurrence on our city streets.
</P>
<P>
   Two TV news personalities from Tyler entered the tomato-eating
contest.
</P>
<P>
   There was, after all this ballyhoo, a tomato contest for the
best home-grown variety. Strangely, the tomatoes are judged on
appearance and size, not taste. Those seem to be the same criteria
the supermarkets use.
</P>
<P>
   The cooking contest is where the taste comes in. It is still too
early to get any of the recipes from this year's contest, but
festival organizers did provide a recipe from the past.
</P>
<P>
   It is a quiche recipe, and don't even start with that ``real
men'' thing. Real men will eat anything.
</P>
<P>
   FRESH TOMATO AND BASIL QUICHE
</P>
<P>
   Yields 6
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable cooking spray
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped onions
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 regular pie shell
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup shredded, part-skim mozzarella
</P>
<P>
   1 cup (1/4-inch thick) sliced tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup shredded fresh basil
</P>
<P>
   1 cup evaporated skim milk
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 egg white
</P>
<P>
   Coat nonstick skillet with cooking spray. Add oil and heat over
medium heat until hot. Add onion and garlic and saute 8 minutes or
until lightly browned. Spread onion mixture on bottom of prepared

<P>
   BAKED ALASKA-BANANA SPLIT PIE
</P>
<P>
   Serves 8
</P>
<P>
   Crust
</P>
<P>
   2 cups chocolate-flavored graham cracker crumbs
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons light brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup finely chopped toasted pecans
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Combine all the ingredients in a medium bowl, then pat onto the
bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate. Bake until
set, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool on a rack; then place in the freezer
for 30 minutes. Filling
</P>
<P>
   1 banana, sliced 1/2-inch thick
</P>
<P>
   2 pints premium strawberry ice cream
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup premium caramel sauce
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup finely chopped ripe pineapple
</P>
<P>
   Place the banana slices in an even layer over the chilled pie
crust. Spread the ice cream evenly over the bananas and drizzle
with the caramel sauce. Top with the pineapple and place in the
freezer until completely frozen, about 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Meringue
</P>
<P>
   3 large egg whites, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   Bring a large pot of water to a simmer over medium heat. Place
the egg whites, sugar, cream of tartar and salt in a large bowl and
whisk to combine. Place the bowl over the simmering water and whisk
until the sugar has melted and the mixture is hot to the touch, 3
to 4 minutes. Remove the bowl from the pot and using a hand-held
mixer, beat until soft peaks form. Add the vanilla extract and
continue beating until the egg whites are glossy and have formed
stiff peaks.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the broiler. Place a rack in the top third of the oven.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the pie from the freezer and, working quickly, spoon the
meringue all over the filling, mounding it in the center and making
sure to spread it all the way to the outer rim, so it touches the
crust. Place the pie on the middle oven rack and bake until the
meringue is golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Freeze the pie for at least 1 hour.

   EGGS McBOSWELL
</P>
<P>
   Serves 2
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces prosciutto, thinly sliced (a little goes a long way)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs
</P>
<P>
   2 slices of Monterey Jack cheese or, if cooking for children, 4
slices of mild Cheddar cheese or mild Italian cheese, like
provolone or mozzarella
</P>
<P>
   2 English muffins, split in half
</P>
<P>
   Mayonnaise
</P>
<P>
   In your nonstick frying pan, fry the prosciutto over high heat,
stirring frequently once the meat starts to sizzle, until crisp, 6
to 8 minutes. Set aside. Remove the pan from the heat to cool
slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Add 1 tablespoon butter to the pan and return to medium heat.
Crack the eggs into the pan and fry until the yolks are set enough
to flip, about 3 to 4 minutes. Flip the eggs and top each with 1
slice of cheese. Cover the pan and cook until the cheese melts,
about 1 minute. With a wide spatula, carefully remove the eggs to a
plate without breaking the yolks.
</P>
<P>
   Melt the remaining butter in the pan. Add the English muffins
and brown on both sides, a total of 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the
muffins from the pan and spread them with mayonnaise to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Place an egg with cheese on top of 2 of the English muffin
halves. Place the prosciutto, evenly divided, on top of the eggs
and cover with the remaining muffin halves to make a sandwich.
Serve while the eggs are still warm.

   SLOPPY JOES
</P>
<P>
   Serves 8
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive or canola oil
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups finely chopped onion
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon chili powder
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds lean ground beef
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup ketchup
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup canned beef broth
</P>
<P>
   10 3/4-ounce can condensed tomato soup
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   8 large premium hamburger buns or sandwich rolls
</P>
<P>
   In your nonstick frying pan, warm the oil over medium heat. Add
the onion and chili powder, cover and cook, stirring once or twice,
for 10 minutes. Crumble the beef into the pan, season with the
salt, and cook, uncovered, breaking up the lumps, until no longer
pink, about 10 minutes. Add the ketchup, broth, soup,
Worcestershire sauce and pepper and bring to a simmer. Partially
cover the pan, lower the heat slightly, and cook, stirring
occasionally, until thick, 30 to 40 minutes. The meat mixture can
be prepared up to 3 days ahead. Refrigerate, covered, and reheat in
the pan just before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Toast the hamburger buns lightly, if desired. Ladle a generous
spoonful of the meat mixture over the bun. It should spill over
onto the plate; do not expect the bun to contain it all. Set the
bun top in place and serve immediately. Provide lots of paper
napkins.

A FATHER'S HOW-TO FOR GETTING FOOD ON THE TABLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY BINGHAM 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's get one thing straight from the start: I'm a dad who can
cook.
</P>
<P>
   And you know what? Like the others, I'm pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   I'll stack my fried chicken against yours any day. My Italian
cream cake will rock your world. My chicken salad? Suffice it to
say that women have begged me for the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   We dads may not all cook the way you moms do, but we believe the
process isn't important _ the product is.
</P>
<P>
   Who cares if we don't always measure spices? If we use whatever
mystery meat is in the freezer? If we start with one ethnic recipe
and swerve across entire continents to fill in the pantry gaps?
</P>
<P>
   I admit that we don't always leave our egos at the pantry door;
the truth is, I have named recipes after myself.
</P>
<P>
   My wife will tell you that Larry's Excellent Chicken is really
chicken marsala, that Larry's Excellent Chicken II is another name
for chicken divan. She knows, after five years of marriage, that
you soak the bird in buttermilk for Larry's Excellent Fried
Chicken.
</P>
<P>
   You see, dads of my generation taught ourselves to saute and
flambe, so forgive us if we're an arrogant lot. We overcame
stereotypes, we mastered pie dough, we tried making biscuits again
and again and again.
</P>
<P>
   Then a funny thing happened as we learned our way around the
kitchen: We discovered that cooking can be relaxing, rewarding, and
you know what else?
</P>
<P>
   Chicks dig it.
</P>
<P>
   So we wipe the sweat from our brow and soldier on.
</P>
<P>
   With Father's Day coming, here's a look at three cookbooks to
make the journey smoother.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Title: ``Boy Meets Grill'' (Hyperion, $32.50)
</P>
<P>
   The scoop: Author and chef Bobby Flay is host of three Food
Network shows including ``Grillin' and Chillin,''' and he owns two
upscale New York restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The skinny: This cookbook is for yuppies. Labor-intensive
recipes will have dads looking for mango nectar, cascabel chile
powder and brie cheese to stuff inside a turkey burger. But every
recipe is mouth-watering.
</P>
<P>
   Skill level: Advanced. Expect Dad to whisk up a meringue,
butterfly a chicken and cut basil into ``chiffonades,'' or fine
ribbons, as Flay explains.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Title: ``A Guy's Guide to Great Eating'' (Houghton Mifflin, $17)
</P>
<P>
   The scoop: Big guy Don Mauer, newspaper columnist and
motivational speaker, lost 100 pounds by trimming 25 percent of the
fat from meat-and-potatoes-style recipes.
</P>
<P>
   The skinny: Mauer's motto: ``When I think of real meals, I think
of meat. There's nothing so gratifying, so flavorful, so
straightforward.'' Be warned: He makes his macaroni and cheese with
Velveeta Light.
</P>
<P>
   Skill level: Novice. This is cooking for dummies, so it's a good
place for beginning dads to start. The only time Mauer gets
complicated is when he's grinding and seasoning sirloin to make a
better burger.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Title: ``A Man and His Pan'' (Andrews McMeel, $16.95)
</P>
<P>
   The scoop: Cookbook author John Boswell brags that this is the
first collection of his own recipes. He says all were tested and
tried on his family; there's even a section devoted to cooking for
kids.
</P>
<P>
   The skinny: Dads who get stuck doing dishes will like Boswell's
gimmick: 140 recipes for your nonstick skillet. Boswell runs the
gamut from gourmet crepes and souffles to traditional steaks and
chops.
</P>
<P>
   Skill level: Intermediate. This is how it would sound if your
big brother taught you to cook. Boswell gently explains why
``challah'' makes better French toast, what different mushrooms do
in recipes and which cuts of meat he prefers.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   MANGO GLAZED TUNA STEAKS WITH BLACK BEAN SALAD
</P>

   2 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped
</P>

   4 cups mango nectar (available in supermarkets in the canned
juice section)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup light brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   Preheat a gas or charcoal grill to medium, or use a side or
stove burner.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the olive oil in medium nonreactive saucepan until almost
smoking. Add the onion and garlic and cook until soft. Add the
serrano pepper and ginger and cook for 2 minutes. Add the nectar
and brown sugar, bring to a boil, and cook until reduced to 2 cups.
Place the mixture in a food processor with the vinegar and process
until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Let cool at room
temperature. May be refrigerated for 1 day; use at room
temperature.

<P>
   Dec. 29, 1940. The Luftwaffe had roared over London. The dome of
Saint Paul's Cathedral rose ghostly above the smoke and flames.
Below, buried in rubble, hundreds of people were dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any alive in there?!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here. I'm Alice. Please find me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rescue crews reached Alice only after nine hours of desperate
digging. To their relief, she seemed intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're all right, my girl. You're all right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My leg. Please. I can't feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City, 1998. A quiet day in the emergency room. William,
my resident, ambled over and said, ``Twenty-five-year-old male with
gross hematuria. He's been peeing red since he woke up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?'' I asked. Many hidden pathologies can turn a healthy
young man's urine a shocking red. ``How many red cells in the
urinalysis?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Five to 10 per field.''
</P>
<P>
   Too few for frank bleeding caused by a kidney stone or a
ruptured kidney cyst. Something besides blood was making our
patient's urine red.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's he do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, not much. He's a prisoner. The cops brought him in
not long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   William and I approached the patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Kelly, how are you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts. Damn. Pardon the language, but it hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing original there. Prisoners often feel the urge for a
change of scenery, and a trip to the ER can fit the bill. But then
Kelly gripped his thighs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're killing me, Doctor!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did anybody hit you? Did you have a bad fall?'' I asked, more
attentive now.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. God help me. I need something for the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   I tried to picture an inmate's schedule of daily activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you worked out recently?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a contest _ deep knee bends. Not much else to do in
jail, Doctor. And I won _ 1,134.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh-oh. When?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Night before last. Winner got extra dessert.''
</P>
<P>
   Now I understood. I owed that understanding to E.G.L. Bywaters,
the brilliant English doctor who treated Alice after her rescue
from the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   At first Alice had seemed fine. Nothing but her left calf had
suffered. But by evening the next day, the leg had turned cold and
blue below the knee. Bywaters called the surgeons in to amputate.
That should have been the end of the case.
</P>
<P>
   But soon afterward Alice's urine turned an ominous brown. Under
the microscope it teemed with casts _ crescents of debris that
congeal when the kidneys' collecting apparatus is dammed or
poisoned. Her kidneys seemed to have shut down.
</P>
<P>
   On the seventh day, wrote Bywaters, Alice ``collapsed and died
in three minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I didn't feel any pain at all,'' continued the
prisoner. ``We did 'em night before last.''
</P>
<P>
   The resident's face lit up. ``Now I know. Rhabdomyolysis,'' he
announced. The word means ``destruction of skeletal muscle.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly had trashed his thigh muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simple,'' I agreed.
</P>
<P>
   It was far from simple in 1941. In March, Bywaters and his
colleague D. Beall noted in the British Medical Journal the deaths
of three more young people with injuries similar to Alice's. Their
autopsies recorded the kidneys as ``the point of major interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidneys are the first stop in the body's waste elimination
system. Blood carrying waste flows into the kidneys via coils of
porous capillaries.
</P>
<P>
   Wrapped around the capillaries are cells that act as
gatekeepers. They keep big items like blood cells and large
proteins inside the blood vessels and permit water, smaller
proteins and waste to pass into the kidney tubules, where, with
more distilling, urine forms.
</P>
<P>
   Bywaters noted that the victims' tubules were clogged with
``dense, brownish material ... that seemed to be all of the same
substance.''
</P>
<P>
   It looked exactly like what he had seen in Alice's urine before
she died. Alice's kidneys, and those of her fellow victims, had
been choked and poisoned. But by what?
</P>
<P>
   The problem begins with wrecked cells. As every budding
Schwarzenegger knows, muscles require constant remodeling. So each
cell is loaded with a potent package of protein-chewing enzymes.
And the cells must also store oxygen and fuel to be ready at a
moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   When muscle cells are crushed or cut off from their blood supply
(as in Alice's case) or violently stressed (as in Kelly's case),
they leak myoglobin, the oxygen-storing protein of the muscles.
</P>
<P>
   What Bywaters did was trace the steps between muscle injury and
kidney failure. He figured out that the brown substance was
myoglobin. At one-fourth the size of hemoglobin, it was the perfect
size to sneak through the meshwork in the kidney capillaries and
clog the urine-forming draining tubules.
</P>
<P>
   Bywaters also figured out why myoglobin was muddy in color.
Myoglobin with a neutral pH stays red and is nontoxic to tubule
cells in the kidneys. But at an acid pH, myoglobin separates into
two daughter molecules, one of which is muddy brown in color and
poisonous.
</P>
<P>
   Patients with muscle injury are often dehydrated, which turns
their blood acidic. Meanwhile, myoglobin, released from dying
muscle cells, clogs kidney tubules. The piled-up myoglobin is then
exposed to increasing amounts of acid, which turns it into its
noxious form.
</P>
<P>
   If this poisoning goes on, the kidneys stop working. They no
longer excrete potassium. And potassium buildup can trigger cardiac
arrest, as it did in Alice.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Kelly's condition wasn't that advanced, but he
could get there. His thighs, at least on a cellular level, were
mincemeat. His urine was saturated with myoglobin. Kidney function
was borderline, and it could go south without warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Kelly's pipes need flushing, William,'' I said. ``Let's go
with a quick liter of saline.''
</P>
<P>
   Bywaters had recommended a minimum of three liters a day to
flush the kidneys. We now know that up to 20 liters is needed. We
also added a hefty dose of baking soda to Kelly's fluids to
neutralize the acid buildup in his blood.
</P>
<P>
   Rhabdomyolysis goes hand in hand with humanity's penchant for
mayhem. Today doctors can treat the condition, but only if we catch
it early. Kelly's brush with killer knee bends was proof of that.

   The resident's face lit up. ``Now I know. Rhabdomyolysis,'' he
announced. The word means ``destruction of skeletal muscle.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly had trashed his thigh muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simple,'' I agreed.
</P>
<P>
   It was far from simple in 1941. In March, Bywaters and his
colleague D. Beall noted in the British Medical Journal the deaths
of three more young people with injuries similar to Alice's. Their
autopsies recorded the kidneys as ``the point of major interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidneys are the first stop in the body's waste elimination
system. Blood carrying waste flows into the kidneys via coils of
porous capillaries.
</P>
<P>
   Wrapped around the capillaries are cells that act as
gatekeepers. They keep big items like blood cells and large
proteins inside the blood vessels and permit water, smaller
proteins and waste to pass into the kidney tubules, where, with
more distilling, urine forms.
</P>
<P>
   Bywaters noted that the victims' tubules were clogged with
``dense, brownish material ... that seemed to be all of the same
substance.''
</P>
<P>
   It looked exactly like what he had seen in Alice's urine before
she died. Alice's kidneys, and those of her fellow victims, had
been choked and poisoned. But by what?
</P>
<P>
   The problem begins with wrecked cells. As every budding
Schwarzenegger knows, muscles require constant remodeling. So each
cell is loaded with a potent package of protein-chewing enzymes.
And the cells must also store oxygen and fuel to be ready at a
moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   When muscle cells are crushed or cut off from their blood supply
(as in Alice's case) or violently stressed (as in Kelly's case),
they leak myoglobin, the oxygen-storing protein of the muscles.
</P>
<P>
   What Bywaters did was trace the steps between muscle injury and
kidney failure. He figured out that the brown substance was
myoglobin. At one-fourth the size of hemoglobin, it was the perfect
size to sneak through the meshwork in the kidney capillaries and
clog the urine-forming draining tubules.
</P>
<P>
   Bywaters also figured out why myoglobin was muddy in color.
Myoglobin with a neutral pH stays red and is nontoxic to tubule
cells in the kidneys. But at an acid pH, myoglobin separates into
two daughter molecules, one of which is muddy brown in color and
poisonous.
</P>
<P>
   Patients with muscle injury are often dehydrated, which turns
their blood acidic. Meanwhile, myoglobin, released from dying
muscle cells, clogs kidney tubules. The piled-up myoglobin is then
exposed to increasing amounts of acid, which turns it into its
noxious form.
</P>
<P>
   If this poisoning goes on, the kidneys stop working. They no
longer excrete potassium. And potassium buildup can trigger cardiac
arrest, as it did in Alice.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Kelly's condition wasn't that advanced, but he
could get there. His thighs, at least on a cellular level, were
mincemeat. His urine was saturated with myoglobin. Kidney function
was borderline, and it could go south without warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Kelly's pipes need flushing, William,'' I said. ``Let's go
with a quick liter of saline.''
</P>
<P>
   Bywaters had recommended a minimum of three liters a day to
flush the kidneys. We now know that up to 20 liters is needed. We
also added a hefty dose of baking soda to Kelly's fluids to
neutralize the acid buildup in his blood.
</P>
<P>
   Rhabdomyolysis goes hand in hand with humanity's penchant for
mayhem. Today doctors can treat the condition, but only if we catch
it early. Kelly's brush with killer knee bends was proof of that.
</P>

   The circle of glass casts a shimmery light like a fine piece of
crystal. It weighs 16 tons and stretches 27 feet from edge to edge.
Yet its understructure, a honeycombed lattice of one-inch-thick
walls, is so precisely wrought that were it dinner-plate size, its
filigree of glass would be wine-goblet thin.
</P>
<P>
   The surface, a sweeping parabola of Euclidean purity, seems
perfectly matched to its function: to peer from a tiny speck in the
universe called Earth into an unimaginably distant past when vast
galaxies were still forming.
</P>
<P>
   In 2002, when it is polished and coated and then paired with a
twin atop Mount Graham, Ariz., this mirror will open a new window
on the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   The mirror is the brainchild of astronomer Roger Angel, whose
boyish face masks a competitiveness that drove him to engage in
one-upmanship with rival mirror makers.
</P>
<P>
   Angel's mirror, shaped and polished, incongruously, in the
bowels of the University of Arizona football stadium, is the
largest piece of optical glass ever cast.
</P>
<P>
   But happily for astronomers, this sleek saucer is only one of an
elite new generation of optics that promises to lead them beyond
the solar system into unexplored regions of space.
</P>
<P>
   Today, seven of these 8-meter-plus mirrors, four of them already
set up 13,800 feet above sea level on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, are
poised to begin the journey.
</P>
<P>
   Two Keck telescopes, whose jigsaw-style mirrors, assembled from
hexagonal pieces, stretch a massive 10 meters across, have been
operating on Mauna Kea since 1990 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Japan's wafer-thin 8.3-meter Subaru (the Japanese name
for the Pleiades constellation) telescope collected its first
images from space in January.
</P>
<P>
   And in the same neighborhood the Gemini North, an 8.1-meter
telescope built by a seven-nation consortium that includes the
United States, is scheduled to begin scanning the heavens any day.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Hemisphere skies, with a panoply of stars that cannot
be seen from the Northern Hemisphere, are about to be probed by the
first two of four Europe-financed 8-meter instruments, called
collectively the Very Large Telescope. One was scheduled to begin
service atop Cerro Paranal in Chile in April. Chile's Cerro Pachon
will get the Gemini South observatory next year.
</P>
<P>
   This amazing new generation of telescopes will take mankind
closer to the dawn of creation than ever before. Previously, the
oldest light gathered by telescopes emanated from galaxies formed a
few billion years after the Big Bang. Theorizing about what
happened any earlier has been a bit like trying to describe what a
toddler would look like by observing a 25-year-old adult.
</P>
<P>
   But astronomers expect the new instruments to show them a more
youthful universe _ ``bits and pieces that came together to form
the first galaxies,'' says Angel, 59, who is head of the University
of Arizona's Steward Mirror Lab.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, the big telescopes have an equally intriguing
assignment: to see planets outside our solar system.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years astronomers have observed 18 stars whose motions
indicate the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have even worked out planet densities and orbital
paths, but so far none of these planets has actually been seen.
</P>
<P>
   The new generation of telescopes could not only put such planets
on the map but, through a spectroscopic analysis of the light they
reflect, determine their composition and _ the ultimate question _
whether they have the potential for harboring life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three or four planets that are far enough from their
stars that they can be resolved by the Large Binocular Telescope,''
Angel says. ``We can actually record the photons from these
planets.''
</P>
<P>
   The new telescopes could begin to unravel a host of other cosmic
mysteries, too. Is the universe flat, round, or saddle-shaped? Why
isn't matter distributed uniformly throughout the universe? And
most puzzling of all, where is the ``missing matter'' thought to
make up 80 percent of the mass of the universe?
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers, famously insatiable, have been keeping Roger Angel
busy. Steward Mirror Lab has turned out a number of sub-5-meter
mirrors, two 6.5s, and the 8.4 now being polished on the floor of
the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Next up, a second 8.4-meter mirror that will join its twin on
Mount Graham, Ariz., in 2002 to form the Large Binocular Telescope
_ a brilliantly powerful instrument whose twin 8.4-meter mirrors,
yoked together, will have the light-gathering capacity of a
12-meter mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Angel is betting that the telescope will be the first to see
planets beyond our solar system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' says Angel, who won a MacArthur Foundation
``genius'' award in 1996, in large part for his achievements in
creating giant mirrors, ``that we're getting the hang of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Angel seems intent on keeping his reputation as top mirror man
intact. Early on, he and his collaborator Neville Woolf decided on
a maximum size of 8 meters for their mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized,'' he says, ``that this was about the biggest
mirror you could transport, given the width of U.S. highways,'' not
to mention the two-lane roads that lead to mountaintop
observatories.
</P>
<P>
   But because of a sort of undeclared space race, their magnum
opus is more than a foot wider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone agreed that 8 meters was a good size,'' Angel says,
``but the Europeans decided to go us one better and made the VLT
8.2. Then the Japanese said, `Fine. We think we'll go for 8.3.' But
our mirror was the last one to have its design formally set, so I
thought I'd go for 8.4.''
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers won't mind if the contest continues. Getting near
the Big Bang is going to take a lot of glass.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Dec. 29, 1940. The Luftwaffe had roared over London. The dome of
Saint Paul's Cathedral rose ghostly above the smoke and flames.
Below, buried in rubble, hundreds of people were dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any alive in there?!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here. I'm Alice. Please find me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rescue crews reached Alice only after nine hours of desperate
digging. To their relief, she seemed intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're all right, my girl. You're all right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My leg. Please. I can't feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City, 1998. A quiet day in the emergency room. William,
my resident, ambled over and said, ``Twenty-five-year-old male with
gross hematuria. He's been peeing red since he woke up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?'' I asked. Many hidden pathologies can turn a healthy
young man's urine a shocking red. ``How many red cells in the
urinalysis?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Five to 10 per field.''
</P>
<P>
   Too few for frank bleeding caused by a kidney stone or a
ruptured kidney cyst. Something besides blood was making our
patient's urine red.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's he do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, not much. He's a prisoner. The cops brought him in
not long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   William and I approached the patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Kelly, how are you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts. Damn. Pardon the language, but it hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing original there. Prisoners often feel the urge for a
change of scenery, and a trip to the ER can fit the bill. But then
Kelly gripped his thighs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're killing me, Doctor!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did anybody hit you? Did you have a bad fall?'' I asked, more
attentive now.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. God help me. I need something for the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   I tried to picture an inmate's schedule of daily activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you worked out recently?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a contest _ deep knee bends. Not much else to do in
jail, Doctor. And I won _ 1,134.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh-oh. When?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Night before last. Winner got extra dessert.''
</P>
<P>
   Now I understood. I owed that understanding to E.G.L. Bywaters,
the brilliant English doctor who treated Alice after her rescue
from the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   At first Alice had seemed fine. Nothing but her left calf had
suffered. But by evening the next day, the leg had turned cold and
blue below the knee. Bywaters called the surgeons in to amputate.
That should have been the end of the case.
</P>
<P>
   But soon afterward Alice's urine turned an ominous brown. Under
the microscope it teemed with casts _ crescents of debris that
congeal when the kidneys' collecting apparatus is dammed or
poisoned. Her kidneys seemed to have shut down.
</P>
<P>
   On the seventh day, wrote Bywaters, Alice ``collapsed and died
in three minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I didn't feel any pain at all,'' continued the
prisoner. ``We did 'em night before last.''
</P>
<P>
   The resident's face lit up. ``Now I know. Rhabdomyolysis,'' he
announced. The word means ``destruction of skeletal muscle.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly had trashed his thigh muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simple,'' I agreed.
</P>
<P>
   It was far from simple in 1941. In March, Bywaters and his
colleague D. Beall noted in the British Medical Journal the deaths
of three more young people with injuries similar to Alice's. Their
autopsies recorded the kidneys as ``the point of major interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidneys are the first stop in the body's waste elimination
system. Blood carrying waste flows into the kidneys via coils of
porous capillaries.
</P>
<P>
   Wrapped around the capillaries are cells that act as
gatekeepers. They keep big items like blood cells and large
proteins inside the blood vessels and permit water, smaller
proteins and waste to pass into the kidney tubules, where, with
more distilling, urine forms.
</P>
<P>
   Bywaters noted that the victims' tubules were clogged with
``dense, brownish material ... that seemed to be all of the same
substance.''
</P>
<P>
   It looked exactly like what he had seen in Alice's urine before
she died. Alice's kidneys, and those of her fellow victims, had
been choked and poisoned. But by what?
</P>
<P>
   The problem begins with wrecked cells. As every budding
Schwarzenegger knows, muscles require constant remodeling. So each
cell is loaded with a potent package of protein-chewing enzymes.
And the cells must also store oxygen and fuel to be ready at a
moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   When muscle cells are crushed or cut off from their blood supply
(as in Alice's case) or violently stressed (as in Kelly's case),
they leak myoglobin, the oxygen-storing protein of the muscles.
</P>
<P>
   What Bywaters did was trace the steps between muscle injury and
kidney failure. He figured out that the brown substance was
myoglobin. At one-fourth the size of hemoglobin, it was the perfect
size to sneak through the meshwork in the kidney capillaries and
clog the urine-forming draining tubules.
</P>
<P>
   Bywaters also figured out why myoglobin was muddy in color.
Myoglobin with a neutral pH stays red and is nontoxic to tubule
cells in the kidneys. But at an acid pH, myoglobin separates into
two daughter molecules, one of which is muddy brown in color and
poisonous.

   Patients with muscle injury are often dehydrated, which turns
their blood acidic. Meanwhile, myoglobin, released from dying
muscle cells, clogs kidney tubules. The piled-up myoglobin is then
exposed to increasing amounts of acid, which turns it into its
noxious form.
</P>
<P>
   If this poisoning goes on, the kidneys stop working. They no
longer excrete potassium. And potassium buildup can trigger cardiac
arrest, as it did in Alice.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Kelly's condition wasn't that advanced, but he
could get there. His thighs, at least on a cellular level, were
mincemeat. His urine was saturated with myoglobin. Kidney function
was borderline, and it could go south without warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Kelly's pipes need flushing, William,'' I said. ``Let's go
with a quick liter of saline.''
</P>
<P>
   Bywaters had recommended a minimum of three liters a day to
flush the kidneys. We now know that up to 20 liters is needed. We
also added a hefty dose of baking soda to Kelly's fluids to
neutralize the acid buildup in his blood.
</P>
<P>
   Rhabdomyolysis goes hand in hand with humanity's penchant for
mayhem. Today doctors can treat the condition, but only if we catch
it early. Kelly's brush with killer knee bends was proof of that.

   Dec. 29, 1940. The Luftwaffe had roared over London. The dome of
Saint Paul's Cathedral rose ghostly above the smoke and flames.
Below, buried in rubble, hundreds of people were dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any alive in there?!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here. I'm Alice. Please find me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rescue crews reached Alice only after nine hours of desperate
digging. To their relief, she seemed intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're all right, my girl. You're all right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My leg. Please. I can't feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City, 1998. A quiet day in the emergency room. William,
my resident, ambled over and said, ``Twenty-five-year-old male with
gross hematuria. He's been peeing red since he woke up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?'' I asked. Many hidden pathologies can turn a healthy
young man's urine a shocking red. ``How many red cells in the
urinalysis?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Five to 10 per field.''
</P>
<P>
   Too few for frank bleeding caused by a kidney stone or a
ruptured kidney cyst. Something besides blood was making our
patient's urine red.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's he do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, not much. He's a prisoner. The cops brought him in
not long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   William and I approached the patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Kelly, how are you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts. Damn. Pardon the language, but it hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing original there. Prisoners often feel the urge for a
change of scenery, and a trip to the ER can fit the bill. But then
Kelly gripped his thighs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're killing me, Doctor!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did anybody hit you? Did you have a bad fall?'' I asked, more
attentive now.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. God help me. I need something for the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   I tried to picture an inmate's schedule of daily activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you worked out recently?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a contest _ deep knee bends. Not much else to do in
jail, Doctor. And I won _ 1,134.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh-oh. When?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Night before last. Winner got extra dessert.''
</P>
<P>
   Now I understood. I owed that understanding to E.G.L. Bywaters,
the brilliant English doctor who treated Alice after her rescue
from the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   At first Alice had seemed fine. Nothing but her left calf had
suffered. But by evening the next day, the leg had turned cold and
blue below the knee. Bywaters called the surgeons in to amputate.
That should have been the end of the case.
</P>
<P>
   But soon afterward Alice's urine turned an ominous brown. Under
the microscope it teemed with casts _ crescents of debris that
congeal when the kidneys' collecting apparatus is dammed or
poisoned. Her kidneys seemed to have shut down.
</P>
<P>
   On the seventh day, wrote Bywaters, Alice ``collapsed and died
in three minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I didn't feel any pain at all,'' continued the
prisoner. ``We did 'em night before last.''
</P>
<P>
   The resident's face lit up. ``Now I know. Rhabdomyolysis,'' he
announced. The word means ``destruction of skeletal muscle.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly had trashed his thigh muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simple,'' I agreed.
</P>
<P>
   It was far from simple in 1941. In March, Bywaters and his
colleague D. Beall noted in the British Medical Journal the deaths
of three more young people with injuries similar to Alice's. Their
autopsies recorded the kidneys as ``the point of major interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidneys are the first stop in the body's waste elimination
system. Blood carrying waste flows into the kidneys via coils of
porous capillaries.
</P>
<P>
   Wrapped around the capillaries are cells that act as
gatekeepers. They keep big items like blood cells and large
proteins inside the blood vessels and permit water, smaller
proteins and waste to pass into the kidney tubules, where, with
more distilling, urine forms.
</P>
<P>
   Bywaters noted that the victims' tubules were clogged with
``dense, brownish material ... that seemed to be all of the same
substance.''
</P>
<P>
   It looked exactly like what he had seen in Alice's urine before
she died. Alice's kidneys, and those of her fellow victims, had
been choked and poisoned. But by what?
</P>
<P>
   The problem begins with wrecked cells. As every budding
Schwarzenegger knows, muscles require constant remodeling. So each
cell is loaded with a potent package of protein-chewing enzymes.
And the cells must also store oxygen and fuel to be ready at a
moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   When muscle cells are crushed or cut off from their blood supply
(as in Alice's case) or violently stressed (as in Kelly's case),
they leak myoglobin, the oxygen-storing protein of the muscles.
</P>
<P>
   What Bywaters did was trace the steps between muscle injury and
kidney failure. He figured out that the brown substance was
myoglobin. At one-fourth the size of hemoglobin, it was the perfect
size to sneak through the meshwork in the kidney capillaries and
clog the urine-forming draining tubules.
</P>
<P>
   Bywaters also figured out why myoglobin was muddy in color.
Myoglobin with a neutral pH stays red and is nontoxic to tubule
cells in the kidneys. But at an acid pH, myoglobin separates into
two daughter molecules, one of which is muddy brown in color and
poisonous.
</P>
<P>
   Patients with muscle injury are often dehydrated, which turns
their blood acidic. Meanwhile, myoglobin, released from dying
muscle cells, clogs kidney tubules. The piled-up myoglobin is then
exposed to increasing amounts of acid, which turns it into its
noxious form.
</P>
<P>
   If this poisoning goes on, the kidneys stop working. They no
longer excrete potassium. And potassium buildup can trigger cardiac
arrest, as it did in Alice.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Kelly's condition wasn't that advanced, but he

mincemeat. His urine was saturated with myoglobin. Kidney function
was borderline, and it could go south without warning.

   The circle of glass casts a shimmery light like a fine piece of
crystal. It weighs 16 tons and stretches 27 feet from edge to edge.
Yet its understructure, a honeycombed lattice of one-inch-thick
walls, is so precisely wrought that were it dinner-plate size, its
filigree of glass would be wine-goblet thin.
</P>
<P>
   The surface, a sweeping parabola of Euclidean purity, seems
perfectly matched to its function: to peer from a tiny speck in the
universe called Earth into an unimaginably distant past when vast
galaxies were still forming.
</P>
<P>
   In 2002, when it is polished and coated and then paired with a
twin atop Mount Graham, Ariz., this mirror will open a new window
on the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   The mirror is the brainchild of astronomer Roger Angel, whose
boyish face masks a competitiveness that drove him to engage in
one-upmanship with rival mirror makers.
</P>
<P>
   Angel's mirror, shaped and polished, incongruously, in the
bowels of the University of Arizona football stadium, is the
largest piece of optical glass ever cast.
</P>
<P>
   But happily for astronomers, this sleek saucer is only one of an
elite new generation of optics that promises to lead them beyond
the solar system into unexplored regions of space.
</P>
<P>
   Today, seven of these 8-meter-plus mirrors, four of them already
set up 13,800 feet above sea level on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, are
poised to begin the journey.
</P>
<P>
   Two Keck telescopes, whose jigsaw-style mirrors, assembled from
hexagonal pieces, stretch a massive 10 meters across, have been
operating on Mauna Kea since 1990 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Japan's wafer-thin 8.3-meter Subaru (the Japanese name
for the Pleiades constellation) telescope collected its first
images from space in January.
</P>
<P>
   And in the same neighborhood the Gemini North, an 8.1-meter
telescope built by a seven-nation consortium that includes the
United States, is scheduled to begin scanning the heavens any day.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Hemisphere skies, with a panoply of stars that cannot
be seen from the Northern Hemisphere, are about to be probed by the
first two of four Europe-financed 8-meter instruments, called
collectively the Very Large Telescope. One was scheduled to begin
service atop Cerro Paranal in Chile in April. Chile's Cerro Pachon
will get the Gemini South observatory next year.
</P>
<P>
   This amazing new generation of telescopes will take mankind
closer to the dawn of creation than ever before. Previously, the
oldest light gathered by telescopes emanated from galaxies formed a
few billion years after the Big Bang. Theorizing about what
happened any earlier has been a bit like trying to describe what a
toddler would look like by observing a 25-year-old adult.
</P>
<P>
   But astronomers expect the new instruments to show them a more
youthful universe _ ``bits and pieces that came together to form
the first galaxies,'' says Angel, 59, who is head of the University
of Arizona's Steward Mirror Lab.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, the big telescopes have an equally intriguing
assignment: to see planets outside our solar system.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years astronomers have observed 18 stars whose motions
indicate the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have even worked out planet densities and orbital
paths, but so far none of these planets has actually been seen.
</P>
<P>
   The new generation of telescopes could not only put such planets
on the map but, through a spectroscopic analysis of the light they
reflect, determine their composition and _ the ultimate question _
whether they have the potential for harboring life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three or four planets that are far enough from their
stars that they can be resolved by the Large Binocular Telescope,''
Angel says. ``We can actually record the photons from these
planets.''
</P>
<P>
   The new telescopes could begin to unravel a host of other cosmic
mysteries, too. Is the universe flat, round, or saddle-shaped? Why
isn't matter distributed uniformly throughout the universe? And
most puzzling of all, where is the ``missing matter'' thought to
make up 80 percent of the mass of the universe?
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers, famously insatiable, have been keeping Roger Angel
busy. Steward Mirror Lab has turned out a number of sub-5-meter
mirrors, two 6.5s, and the 8.4 now being polished on the floor of
the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Next up, a second 8.4-meter mirror that will join its twin on
Mount Graham, Ariz., in 2002 to form the Large Binocular Telescope
_ a brilliantly powerful instrument whose twin 8.4-meter mirrors,
yoked together, will have the light-gathering capacity of a
12-meter mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Angel is betting that the telescope will be the first to see
planets beyond our solar system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' says Angel, who won a MacArthur Foundation
``genius'' award in 1996, in large part for his achievements in
creating giant mirrors, ``that we're getting the hang of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Angel seems intent on keeping his reputation as top mirror man
intact. Early on, he and his collaborator Neville Woolf decided on
a maximum size of 8 meters for their mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized,'' he says, ``that this was about the biggest
mirror you could transport, given the width of U.S. highways,'' not
to mention the two-lane roads that lead to mountaintop
observatories.
</P>
<P>
   But because of a sort of undeclared space race, their magnum
opus is more than a foot wider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone agreed that 8 meters was a good size,'' Angel says,
``but the Europeans decided to go us one better and made the VLT
8.2. Then the Japanese said, `Fine. We think we'll go for 8.3.' But
our mirror was the last one to have its design formally set, so I
thought I'd go for 8.4.''
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers won't mind if the contest continues. Getting near
the Big Bang is going to take a lot of glass.

   Dec. 29, 1940. The Luftwaffe had roared over London. The dome of
Saint Paul's Cathedral rose ghostly above the smoke and flames.
Below, buried in rubble, hundreds of people were dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any alive in there?!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here. I'm Alice. Please find me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rescue crews reached Alice only after nine hours of desperate
digging. To their relief, she seemed intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're all right, my girl. You're all right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My leg. Please. I can't feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City, 1998. A quiet day in the emergency room. William,
my resident, ambled over and said, ``Twenty-five-year-old male with
gross hematuria. He's been peeing red since he woke up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?'' I asked. Many hidden pathologies can turn a healthy
young man's urine a shocking red. ``How many red cells in the
urinalysis?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Five to 10 per field.''
</P>
<P>
   Too few for frank bleeding caused by a kidney stone or a
ruptured kidney cyst. Something besides blood was making our
patient's urine red.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's he do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, not much. He's a prisoner. The cops brought him in
not long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   William and I approached the patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Kelly, how are you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts. Damn. Pardon the language, but it hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing original there. Prisoners often feel the urge for a
change of scenery, and a trip to the ER can fit the bill. But then
Kelly gripped his thighs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're killing me, Doctor!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did anybody hit you? Did you have a bad fall?'' I asked, more
attentive now.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. God help me. I need something for the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   I tried to picture an inmate's schedule of daily activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you worked out recently?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a contest _ deep knee bends. Not much else to do in
jail, Doctor. And I won _ 1,134.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh-oh. When?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Night before last. Winner got extra dessert.''
</P>
<P>
   Now I understood. I owed that understanding to E.G.L. Bywaters,
the brilliant English doctor who treated Alice after her rescue
from the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   At first Alice had seemed fine. Nothing but her left calf had
suffered. But by evening the next day, the leg had turned cold and
blue below the knee. Bywaters called the surgeons in to amputate.
That should have been the end of the case.
</P>
<P>
   But soon afterward Alice's urine turned an ominous brown. Under
the microscope it teemed with casts _ crescents of debris that
congeal when the kidneys' collecting apparatus is dammed or
poisoned. Her kidneys seemed to have shut down.
</P>
<P>
   On the seventh day, wrote Bywaters, Alice ``collapsed and died
in three minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I didn't feel any pain at all,'' continued the
prisoner. ``We did 'em night before last.''
</P>
<P>
   The resident's face lit up. ``Now I know. Rhabdomyolysis,'' he
announced. The word means ``destruction of skeletal muscle.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly had trashed his thigh muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simple,'' I agreed.
</P>
<P>
   It was far from simple in 1941. In March, Bywaters and his
colleague D. Beall noted in the British Medical Journal the deaths
of three more young people with injuries similar to Alice's. Their
autopsies recorded the kidneys as ``the point of major interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidneys are the first stop in the body's waste elimination
system. Blood carrying waste flows into the kidneys via coils of
porous capillaries.
</P>
<P>
   Wrapped around the capillaries are cells that act as
gatekeepers. They keep big items like blood cells and large
proteins inside the blood vessels and permit water, smaller
proteins and waste to pass into the kidney tubules, where, with
more distilling, urine forms.
</P>
<P>
   Bywaters noted that the victims' tubules were clogged with
``dense, brownish material ... that seemed to be all of the same
substance.''
</P>
<P>
   It looked exactly like what he had seen in Alice's urine before
she died. Alice's kidneys, and those of her fellow victims, had
been choked and poisoned. But by what?
</P>
<P>
   The problem begins with wrecked cells. As every budding
Schwarzenegger knows, muscles require constant remodeling. So each
cell is loaded with a potent package of protein-chewing enzymes.
And the cells must also store oxygen and fuel to be ready at a
moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   When muscle cells are crushed or cut off from their blood supply
(as in Alice's case) or violently stressed (as in Kelly's case),
they leak myoglobin, the oxygen-storing protein of the muscles.
</P>
<P>
   What Bywaters did was trace the steps between muscle injury and
kidney failure. He figured out that the brown substance was
myoglobin. At one-fourth the size of hemoglobin, it was the perfect
size to sneak through the meshwork in the kidney capillaries and
clog the urine-forming draining tubules.
</P>
<P>
   Bywaters also figured out why myoglobin was muddy in color.
Myoglobin with a neutral pH stays red and is nontoxic to tubule
cells in the kidneys. But at an acid pH, myoglobin separates into
two daughter molecules, one of which is muddy brown in color and
poisonous.
</P>
<P>
   Patients with muscle injury are often dehydrated, which turns
their blood acidic. Meanwhile, myoglobin, released from dying
muscle cells, clogs kidney tubules. The piled-up myoglobin is then
exposed to increasing amounts of acid, which turns it into its
noxious form.
</P>
<P>
   If this poisoning goes on, the kidneys stop working. They no
longer excrete potassium. And potassium buildup can trigger cardiac
arrest, as it did in Alice.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Kelly's condition wasn't that advanced, but he
could get there. His thighs, at least on a cellular level, were
mincemeat. His urine was saturated with myoglobin. Kidney function
was borderline, and it could go south without warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Kelly's pipes need flushing, William,'' I said. ``Let's go
with a quick liter of saline.''
</P>
<P>
   Bywaters had recommended a minimum of three liters a day to
flush the kidneys. We now know that up to 20 liters is needed. We
also added a hefty dose of baking soda to Kelly's fluids to
neutralize the acid buildup in his blood.
</P>
<P>
   Rhabdomyolysis goes hand in hand with humanity's penchant for
mayhem. Today doctors can treat the condition, but only if we catch
it early. Kelly's brush with killer knee bends was proof of that.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The circle of glass casts a shimmery light like a fine piece of
crystal. It weighs 16 tons and stretches 27 feet from edge to edge.
Yet its understructure, a honeycombed lattice of one-inch-thick
walls, is so precisely wrought that were it dinner-plate size, its
filigree of glass would be wine-goblet thin.
</P>
<P>
   The surface, a sweeping parabola of Euclidean purity, seems
perfectly matched to its function: to peer from a tiny speck in the
universe called Earth into an unimaginably distant past when vast
galaxies were still forming.
</P>
<P>
   In 2002, when it is polished and coated and then paired with a
twin atop Mount Graham, Ariz., this mirror will open a new window
on the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   The mirror is the brainchild of astronomer Roger Angel, whose
boyish face masks a competitiveness that drove him to engage in
one-upmanship with rival mirror makers.
</P>
<P>
   Angel's mirror, shaped and polished, incongruously, in the
bowels of the University of Arizona football stadium, is the
largest piece of optical glass ever cast.
</P>
<P>
   But happily for astronomers, this sleek saucer is only one of an
elite new generation of optics that promises to lead them beyond
the solar system into unexplored regions of space.
</P>
<P>
   Today, seven of these 8-meter-plus mirrors, four of them already
set up 13,800 feet above sea level on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, are
poised to begin the journey.
</P>
<P>
   Two Keck telescopes, whose jigsaw-style mirrors, assembled from
hexagonal pieces, stretch a massive 10 meters across, have been
operating on Mauna Kea since 1990 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Japan's wafer-thin 8.3-meter Subaru (the Japanese name
for the Pleiades constellation) telescope collected its first
images from space in January.
</P>
<P>
   And in the same neighborhood the Gemini North, an 8.1-meter
telescope built by a seven-nation consortium that includes the
United States, is scheduled to begin scanning the heavens any day.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Hemisphere skies, with a panoply of stars that cannot
be seen from the Northern Hemisphere, are about to be probed by the
first two of four Europe-financed 8-meter instruments, called
collectively the Very Large Telescope. One was scheduled to begin
service atop Cerro Paranal in Chile in April. Chile's Cerro Pachon
will get the Gemini South observatory next year.
</P>
<P>
   This amazing new generation of telescopes will take mankind
closer to the dawn of creation than ever before. Previously, the
oldest light gathered by telescopes emanated from galaxies formed a
few billion years after the Big Bang. Theorizing about what
happened any earlier has been a bit like trying to describe what a
toddler would look like by observing a 25-year-old adult.
</P>
<P>
   But astronomers expect the new instruments to show them a more
youthful universe _ ``bits and pieces that came together to form
the first galaxies,'' says Angel, 59, who is head of the University
of Arizona's Steward Mirror Lab.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, the big telescopes have an equally intriguing
assignment: to see planets outside our solar system.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years astronomers have observed 18 stars whose motions
indicate the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have even worked out planet densities and orbital
paths, but so far none of these planets has actually been seen.
</P>
<P>
   The new generation of telescopes could not only put such planets
on the map but, through a spectroscopic analysis of the light they
reflect, determine their composition and _ the ultimate question _
whether they have the potential for harboring life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three or four planets that are far enough from their
stars that they can be resolved by the Large Binocular Telescope,''
Angel says. ``We can actually record the photons from these
planets.''
</P>
<P>
   The new telescopes could begin to unravel a host of other cosmic
mysteries, too. Is the universe flat, round, or saddle-shaped? Why
isn't matter distributed uniformly throughout the universe? And
most puzzling of all, where is the ``missing matter'' thought to
make up 80 percent of the mass of the universe?
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers, famously insatiable, have been keeping Roger Angel
busy. Steward Mirror Lab has turned out a number of sub-5-meter
mirrors, two 6.5s, and the 8.4 now being polished on the floor of
the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Next up, a second 8.4-meter mirror that will join its twin on
Mount Graham, Ariz., in 2002 to form the Large Binocular Telescope
_ a brilliantly powerful instrument whose twin 8.4-meter mirrors,
yoked together, will have the light-gathering capacity of a
12-meter mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Angel is betting that the telescope will be the first to see
planets beyond our solar system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' says Angel, who won a MacArthur Foundation
``genius'' award in 1996, in large part for his achievements in
creating giant mirrors, ``that we're getting the hang of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Angel seems intent on keeping his reputation as top mirror man
intact. Early on, he and his collaborator Neville Woolf decided on
a maximum size of 8 meters for their mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized,'' he says, ``that this was about the biggest
mirror you could transport, given the width of U.S. highways,'' not
to mention the two-lane roads that lead to mountaintop
observatories.
</P>
<P>
   But because of a sort of undeclared space race, their magnum
opus is more than a foot wider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone agreed that 8 meters was a good size,'' Angel says,
``but the Europeans decided to go us one better and made the VLT
8.2. Then the Japanese said, `Fine. We think we'll go for 8.3.' But
our mirror was the last one to have its design formally set, so I
thought I'd go for 8.4.''
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers won't mind if the contest continues. Getting near
the Big Bang is going to take a lot of glass.

   The circle of glass casts a shimmery light like a fine piece of
crystal. It weighs 16 tons and stretches 27 feet from edge to edge.
Yet its understructure, a honeycombed lattice of one-inch-thick
walls, is so precisely wrought that were it dinner-plate size, its
filigree of glass would be wine-goblet thin.
</P>
<P>
   The surface, a sweeping parabola of Euclidean purity, seems
perfectly matched to its function: to peer from a tiny speck in the
universe called Earth into an unimaginably distant past when vast
galaxies were still forming.
</P>
<P>
   In 2002, when it is polished and coated and then paired with a
twin atop Mount Graham, Ariz., this mirror will open a new window
on the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   The mirror is the brainchild of astronomer Roger Angel, whose
boyish face masks a competitiveness that drove him to engage in
one-upmanship with rival mirror makers.
</P>
<P>
   Angel's mirror, shaped and polished, incongruously, in the
bowels of the University of Arizona football stadium, is the
largest piece of optical glass ever cast.
</P>
<P>
   But happily for astronomers, this sleek saucer is only one of an
elite new generation of optics that promises to lead them beyond
the solar system into unexplored regions of space.
</P>
<P>
   Today, seven of these 8-meter-plus mirrors, four of them already
set up 13,800 feet above sea level on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, are
poised to begin the journey.
</P>
<P>
   Two Keck telescopes, whose jigsaw-style mirrors, assembled from
hexagonal pieces, stretch a massive 10 meters across, have been
operating on Mauna Kea since 1990 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Japan's wafer-thin 8.3-meter Subaru (the Japanese name
for the Pleiades constellation) telescope collected its first
images from space in January.
</P>
<P>
   And in the same neighborhood the Gemini North, an 8.1-meter
telescope built by a seven-nation consortium that includes the
United States, is scheduled to begin scanning the heavens any day.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Hemisphere skies, with a panoply of stars that cannot
be seen from the Northern Hemisphere, are about to be probed by the
first two of four Europe-financed 8-meter instruments, called
collectively the Very Large Telescope. One was scheduled to begin
service atop Cerro Paranal in Chile in April. Chile's Cerro Pachon
will get the Gemini South observatory next year.
</P>
<P>
   This amazing new generation of telescopes will take mankind
closer to the dawn of creation than ever before. Previously, the
oldest light gathered by telescopes emanated from galaxies formed a
few billion years after the Big Bang. Theorizing about what
happened any earlier has been a bit like trying to describe what a
toddler would look like by observing a 25-year-old adult.
</P>
<P>
   But astronomers expect the new instruments to show them a more
youthful universe _ ``bits and pieces that came together to form
the first galaxies,'' says Angel, 59, who is head of the University
of Arizona's Steward Mirror Lab.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, the big telescopes have an equally intriguing
assignment: to see planets outside our solar system.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years astronomers have observed 18 stars whose motions
indicate the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have even worked out planet densities and orbital
paths, but so far none of these planets has actually been seen.
</P>
<P>
   The new generation of telescopes could not only put such planets
on the map but, through a spectroscopic analysis of the light they
reflect, determine their composition and _ the ultimate question _
whether they have the potential for harboring life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three or four planets that are far enough from their
stars that they can be resolved by the Large Binocular Telescope,''
Angel says. ``We can actually record the photons from these
planets.''
</P>
<P>
   The new telescopes could begin to unravel a host of other cosmic
mysteries, too. Is the universe flat, round, or saddle-shaped? Why
isn't matter distributed uniformly throughout the universe? And
most puzzling of all, where is the ``missing matter'' thought to
make up 80 percent of the mass of the universe?
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers, famously insatiable, have been keeping Roger Angel
busy. Steward Mirror Lab has turned out a number of sub-5-meter
mirrors, two 6.5s, and the 8.4 now being polished on the floor of
the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Next up, a second 8.4-meter mirror that will join its twin on
Mount Graham, Ariz., in 2002 to form the Large Binocular Telescope
_ a brilliantly powerful instrument whose twin 8.4-meter mirrors,
yoked together, will have the light-gathering capacity of a
12-meter mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Angel is betting that the telescope will be the first to see
planets beyond our solar system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' says Angel, who won a MacArthur Foundation
``genius'' award in 1996, in large part for his achievements in
creating giant mirrors, ``that we're getting the hang of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Angel seems intent on keeping his reputation as top mirror man
intact. Early on, he and his collaborator Neville Woolf decided on
a maximum size of 8 meters for their mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized,'' he says, ``that this was about the biggest
mirror you could transport, given the width of U.S. highways,'' not
to mention the two-lane roads that lead to mountaintop
observatories.
</P>
<P>
   But because of a sort of undeclared space race, their magnum
opus is more than a foot wider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone agreed that 8 meters was a good size,'' Angel says,
``but the Europeans decided to go us one better and made the VLT
8.2. Then the Japanese said, `Fine. We think we'll go for 8.3.' But
our mirror was the last one to have its design formally set, so I
thought I'd go for 8.4.''
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers won't mind if the contest continues. Getting near
the Big Bang is going to take a lot of glass.

FEUDING SIBLINGS AGREE TO KEEP TALKING 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Both sides in the 49ers' ownership dispute have
agreed to continue talking, under the supervision of a federal
judge in Ohio, according to spokesmen for Eddie DeBartolo and his
estranged sister, Denise DeBartolo York.
</P>
<P>
   Ordered last month by U.S. District Judge Daniel Polster of
Akron, Ohio, to try to iron out their legal differences, DeBartolo
and York returned to court Monday to report on the status of their
talks.
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication whether progress had been made, but
Polster ordered them to continue talking and report back to him
June 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge asked both sides to keep the discussions private,''
said York spokesman Sam Singer. ``That's all I can say.''
</P>
<P>
   In lawsuits threatening to sidetrack plans for a new stadium in
San Francisco, DeBartolo and York are suing each other.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo says his sister breached a contractual agreement with
him and engaged in ``oppressive and malicious'' conduct by trying
to keep him out of family businesses.
</P>
<P>
   He also accused her of trying to ``pressure him financially into
compromising his rights for pennies on the dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo, suing York in Ohio, is seeking $150 million in
damages.
</P>
<P>
   York, suing DeBartolo in San Francisco Superior Court, accused
her brother of reneging on a $94 million debt to the family
corporation they co-own, Edward J. DeBartolo Inc. of Youngstown,
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Litigation in both cases was suspended last month when Polster
called for talks.
</P>
<P>
   If the warring siblings are able to resolve their differences,
it could prepare the way for a peaceful financial split.
</P>
<P>
   That, in turn, would make it possible for whoever remained in
control of the 49ers football team to move ahead on the
long-stalled plan to build a new stadium and adjoining commercial
center. The project was approved by San Francisco voters two years
ago.

 &HT;    Levi and company put fresh lyricism into Mahler cycle
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Conductors who used to do Beethoven cycles now do Mahler cycles.
Both for Atlanta Symphony Orchestra audiences and collectors of
Mahler symphony sets, it's too bad Yoel Levi's contract with the
ASO expires before he finishes his. With previous CDs of the fifth
and sixth, the newly issued No. 4 takes him a third of the way
through the nine finished works. For this, the gentlest and most
intimate of Mahler's epic works, Levi leads a spacious reading
without neglecting brilliant orchestral touches such as the acid
clarinet, peculiar to Mahler, played here by Laura Ardan. The
scherzo is particularly eccentric and fresh. In the fourth
movement, mezzo Frederica von Stade sings of husbandry in heaven
with a full, glinting sound. Telarc fills out the disc with von
Stade singing ``Songs of a Wayfarer,'' four bittersweet ballads
that became raw material for Symphony No. 1 and even ``Das Lied von
der Erde.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   Mezzo Virginia Dupuy of Southern Methodist University, who sang
the Mozart ``Requiem'' with Atlanta Ballet in March, has recorded
all the published songs of Alma Schindler, written before she
married Mahler in 1902. Rich and luscious, as is Dupuy's voice,
they are notable for the breadth of the poets she set, from Rainer
Maria Rilke to Franz Werfel (who became her third husband in 1929).
Pianist Simon Sargon partners her beautifully, and these
accompaniments are not easy.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of recently released CDs

   &QR;  ROCK
</P>
<P>
   ``Astro Lounge''
</P>
<P>
   Smash Mouth. Interscope Records. 15 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Sixties party rock, with its hip-shaking, often organ-fueled
grooves has been canonized, anthologized and plagiarized for so
long that you'd be forgiven for thinking it's an exhausted
subgenre. What a shock then, to find it sounding so fresh, as
played by this cool California quartet. Smash Mouth first attempted
the '60s thing on ``Walking on the Sun,'' the hit from its 1997
debut ``Fush Yu Mang.'' But the rest of the album was sloppy
ska-thrash nonsense. Here, the band expands the retro party,
reaching a peak with the perfect summer anthem ``All Star.'' Like
most soirees, the momentum occasionally flags, but the album ends
on a high note with a deliriously groovy cover of the chestnut
``Can't Get Enough of You Baby.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   The Manic Street Preachers roared out of South Wales in the
early '90s, spouting lyrical obscenities at queen and country. The
band was soon huge, selling out U.K. arenas throughout a bumpy
career that includes the mysterious disappearance of original
member Richey James Edwards. Those stinging lyrics are now buoyed
by gorgeous melodies and expansive arrangements. Guitarist James
Dean Bradfield's voice generates much of the power in this album's
first two U.K. singles, ``If You Tolerate This, Then Your Children
Will Be Next'' and ``The Everlasting.'' Few bands have matured with
this much style and elegance.

</P>
<P>
   ``Fosse''
</P>
<P>
   Original cast. RCA Victor. 21 tracks. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   You'd think a dance musical such as ``Fosse'' would be better
seen than heard, but that's not necessarily so. The score of this
1999 Tony-winning show is so evocative that visions of dancers with
shoulders slouching, heads popping and toes turned out a la Bob
Fosse (1927-1987) leap to mind whenever the horns bray or a
percussionist's brush dances atop a cymbal. The vocals are
flawless: ``Big Spender,'' ``Steam Heat,'' ``Bye Bye Blackbird''
and ``Razzle Dazzle'' among them. Fosse, with the help of this
show's re-creators, has indeed left ``footsteps on the sands of
time.''

<P>
   ``Double Up''

</P>
<P>
   First Ma$e was the mumbling rapper whom people couldn't
understand. Now what the Atlanta transplant is saying is quite
clear. It just might not be what people want to hear. ``Double Up''
is often a downer, the work of someone nearly opposite from the
smiling, infectious sidekick introduced by Sean ``Puffy'' Combs on
their rah-rah 1996 single ``Can't Nobody Hold Me Down.'' Three
years later, after selling 4 million copies of his debut, ``Harlem
World,'' Mase is threatening to shoot people (``Stay Out of My
Way'') and is suspicious of women attracted by the money he's
always talking about (``Oh Daddy''). Sample-heavy party songs such
as ``Get Ready'' are now the exception. Ma$e won't discuss why he's
quitting rap to do God's work. But the mood of this album says it
all.

 &HT;    Newman back to satirical self
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once pop's supreme satirist, Randy Newman the double-edged
tunesmith gradually became Randy Newman the prolific movie
soundtrack composer. While the distance between the politically
incorrect ``Short People'' and the sentimentally feel-good music
for, say, ``Toy Story'' and ``James and the Giant Peach'' is one
measured mostly in degrees of attitude, it seemed Newman no longer
needed to indulge his winningly darker side.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Bad Love'' triumphantly testifies, he was only giving it a
long break. This jaunty song cycle signals the return of a socially
incisive sensibility, one who spoofs ossified dinosaur rock stars
one moment (``I'm Dead''), only to ponder the plight of the young
Karl Marx a few tunes later (``The World Isn't Fair''). He shapes
his clipped, cramped nasal voice to the hipster patois of a New
Orleans pimp (``Shame'') and fancies himself a cowboy (``Big Hat,
No Cattle''), but he succeeds best when he reaches the most. The
album's highlight, a lesson in human nature called ``The Great
Nations of Europe,'' surveys centuries of imperial rape and pillage
in rollicking rhyme. It's as if the angel of history was, in fact,
a piano player in an old vaudeville house. That's Newman's great
gift, to marry pop pastiche to a kind of political cartooning.
What's new and surprising is his willingness to play it straight.
It's only for one song, a message of affection to his ex-wife, but
is all the more jarring because of that. When Newman sings ``I Miss
You,'' the only role he's playing is himself, and what could be
cloying becomes a moving instance of emotional candor.

   Paranoid thrills from taut `Enemy'
</P>
<P>
   By Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   ``Enemy of the State'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   George Orwell's Big Brother had nothing on the snooping tactics
of the U.S. National Security Agency. According to this paranoid
thriller, your wardrobe can betray you, thanks to tracking devices
hidden in buttons, watches and fountain pens.
</P>
<P>
   Recycling paranoia plot devices from other movies (``The
Conversation,'' ``Three Days of the Condor''), ``Enemy of the
State'' keeps Will Smith (as the innocent guy caught in the middle)
and Gene Hackman (as an old espionage pro) on the run from big
government bad guys.
</P>
<P>
   A sharp cast and slick production compensate for the movie's
occasional lapses in logic. Director Tony Scott (``Crimson Tide'')
keeps the tension tight with inventive chases through tunnels, over
rooftops and through busy hotels. Unlike other overblown epics from
producer Jerry Bruckheimer (``The Rock'' and ``Armageddon''), this
movie maintains a relatively human scale. Its action scenes are
shot and paced with precision. Grade: B

In this enjoyably dumb B movie, Elijah Wood and fellow high
schoolers battle an outer-space whatsit that's turning their
teachers (including Jon Stewart and Famke Janssen) into oozy pod
people. Grade: B -
</P>
<P>

<P>
   &QR;  ``Little Voice'' (R) _ When Little Voice (Jane Horrocks) opens
her mouth, out come Garland, Streisand, Dietrich. She's an uncanny
vocal (and physical) impersonator. But when she's not performing,
this film of the British stage play can be unbearable. Brenda
Blethyn goes over the top as Horrocks' slatternly mother, and Ewan
McGregor is wasted playing a mild-mannered pigeon lover. Luckily,
Michael Caine, as a small-time talent scout, keeps his scenes
churning with venom. Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   _ Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Dancing at Lughnasa'' (PG) _ This week's second example of a
stage play that fails to make a smooth screen transition. Meryl
Streep heads an ensemble cast in this memory play about Irish
sisters fighting repressed passions and trying to make ends meet.
It's well-acted but remote. Grade: C +

<P>
   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (Moved in `e' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SURREALISM-GUGGENHEIM (New York) _ Surrealism, generally thought
of as melting watches and men in bowler hats descending from the
sky, began as a literary movement. The movement in its heyday
always had a literary bent _ a wide angle, in fact, to judge by the
large number of remarkable book illustrations and covers on view in
``Surrealism: Two Private Eyes,'' an exhibition at the Guggenheim
Museum running through Sept. 12. By Vicki Goldberg. (Moved)
</P>
<P>
   BEATLES-COLLECTORS (Undated) _ Respectability has come late to
Beatles collecting. By Allan Kozinn. (Moved)
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND-MUSIC (Undated) _ Franz Welser-Moest's scheduled
ascendance in 2002 to music director of the Cleveland Orchestra is
hopeful news. Conductors and orchestras are sometimes about
individual and collective personalities, but in some places,
Cleveland among them, the subject is chemistry. By Bernard Holland.
(Moved)
</P>
<P>
   VIDEO-DISKS (Undated) _ For 20 years home video has thrived on a
simple process: choose a movie, watch it, engage in some thought
and discussion, move on. Now, though, operating on the principle
that nothing gets simpler, along comes the digital video disk (DVD)
to immerse one in films to a degree that will intrigue some and
repel others. DVD invites the average viewer to become a film buff,
defined as one who wants to know all about how the movie was made
and by whom. By Peter M. Nichols. (Moved)
</P>
<P>
   CHOPIN-MUSIC (Undated) _ Music history has its myths and its
debunkers of myths. Beethoven wasn't quite the political idealist
he seems in the story about tearing up the ``Eroica'' dedication
when Napoleon crowned himself Emperor; Schubert wasn't a cheerful
bohemian who died unknown. In the case of Chopin, it is so obvious
that his melodies and arabesques sound like the `bel canto'' opera
of his day that the conventional wisdom has him ``influenced'' by
opera. By Will Crutchfield.
</P>
<P>
   TV-CRITICS (Undated) _ Jeff MacGregor bemoans the life of a
television critic.
</P>
<P>
   ART-VANDYCK(Undated) _ Sometimes his royal patron was slow to
pay, but in the main England was good to Anthony Van Dyck. He first
crossed the Channel at age 21, summoned to the court of James I as
the outstanding disciple of the magisterial Rubens and already a
star in his own right. That brief stay, from late 1620 into early
1621, was a prelude to his reign as ``principalle Paynter in
ordinary their Majesties,'' beginning in 1632. Apart from an
interval back home in Brabant from early 1634 to early 1635, Van
Dyck remained in England for the rest of his too brief life. Death
claimed him at home in Blackfriars in 1641. His bones lie at St.
Paul's. Not that Antwerp ever neglected or forgot him. By Matthew
Gurewitsch.
</P>
<P>
   ART-NY-GALLERY (New York) _ The rich and various history of art
in New York in the 1960s and '70s is being rewritten _ not at any
of the universities where graduate students avidly pore over the
origins of Pop, Minimal and Conceptual Art, nor at the uptown
museums that seem content to keep reinvestigating acknowledged
masters like Jasper Johns and Ellsworth Kelly, but at a
hole-in-the-wall storefront gallery on Thompson Street. By Barry
Schwabsky.
</P>
<P>
   MOVIES-OPHULS (New York) _ Whatever the summer movies may bring,
it is a safe bet that the most ravishing, romantic images onscreen
this season will be at the Max Ophuls retrospective, starting on
June 25 and running through July 15 at the Film Society of Lincoln
Center's Walter Reade Theater. By Phillip Lopate.

   Taking Along Bookmarks
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there any way I can convert my America Online 4.0 Favorite
Places so that I can use them with Internet Explorer 5.0?
</P>
<P>
   A. Favorite Places, AOL's version of bookmarks, is a database
file that is specially coded to save space. Other programs can't
read the AOL code, so just copying the Favorite Places file into
your new browser won't work.
</P>
<P>
   Although time-consuming, perhaps the simplest way to transfer
favorite Web site locations from America Online to Internet
Explorer 5.0 is to copy them one by one.
</P>
<P>
   To copy a URL from your Favorite Places without starting up the
AOL browser, click on the Edit button (or right-click on the
Favorite) to see and copy the address; then switch to Explorer, and
paste the URL into the Address box. Hit Enter to go to the page.
Open the Favorites list in Explorer, and click on Add.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to copy Web site URLs only, skip the addresses that
have ``aol://'' at the beginning. They point to internal America
Online content. If you do want to copy some AOL-page bookmarks,
they will be accessible only if you continue to have an AOL
account.
</P>
<P>
   If you have bookmarks saved in Netscape Navigator that you want
to transfer to Explorer 5.0, there is a new feature that makes it
easy. In Explorer, go to the File menu, select Import and Export
and follow the instructions.

   Tunneling Terror
</P>
<P>
   Q. The leaves on my columbine (Aquilegia Music Mix) have tracks
resembling those seen in tree bark created by bark beetles. Do you
know what is making these tracks in the leaves? It is killing my
once happy and blooming plant.
</P>
<P>
   A. They may be making your columbine look bad, but those
striking white, squiggly markings probably aren't killing it.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you were very observant, it's unlikely that you noticed
the one-sixteenth-inch, nondescript grayish flies occasionally
hovering around. But the females were noticing your columbine, and
they made a small pinhole in a leaf, through which they took a bit
of nourishing sap, and left an egg behind. The maggot that hatches
is appropriately called a columbine leaf miner.
</P>
<P>
   In less than two weeks, it chews a tunnel between the leaf
surfaces, exits through a small slit it makes and falls to the
ground, where it pupates for about two more weeks and then emerges
as an adult. The life cycle is fast enough that there are several
generations each year, with the last pupa overwintering in the
soil, dreaming about more delicious columbine next spring.
</P>
<P>
   If you notice the pinhole before the tunnel starts, or spot the
tunnels when they are still short, remove and destroy the leaf. But
longer tunnels mean the leaf miner has packed her pickax and left.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Karl Valley, an entomologist with the Pennsylvania
Agriculture Department in Harrisburg, said that the tunnels are as
obvious to the leaf miner's other enemies as they are to you, so
the leaf miners try to finish their business fast, making it hard
to catch them in the act. He suggested not picking leaves off since
there is plenty of chlorophyll left unless the invasion is
especially heavy. Dr. Valley said he had quit growing columbines in
his garden because he hated looking at the disfigured leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a serious infestation, some gardeners cut columbines
to the ground, destroy the leaves and enjoy the fresh foliage that
regrows, knowing they won't get flowers.
</P>
<P>
   If you are willing to exchange the wide color range possible
with hybrids for the reds and yellows and the smaller flowers of
our elegant, native Aquilegia canadensis, you will find that they
are much less susceptible to leaf miners while being every bit as
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for Wisteria
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have had a wisteria for two years. It is growing nicely
with a lot of leaves, but there are no flowers at all for some
reason. My local nursery suggested giving it 5-10-5. Please help me
by telling me what I should do, before my husband cuts it down.
</P>
<P>
   A. It is likely that your wisteria simply isn't old enough yet
and that it will flower when it's ready, regardless of your
husband's threats. It should not be given any more fertilizer,
however, since lots of nitrogen in the soil causes plants to forego
flowering and grab the opportunity to grow tall. Keep feeding it
and you may have to go to the third floor windows to really
appreciate it when it finally blooms.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that your wisteria is in full sun all day, a definite
requirement, you can also encourage blooming by properly pruning
it. Just after it has bloomed (any time from late May through
mid-June, if yours isn't cooperating yet), cut back all the side
shoots to just six or seven leaves. Any subsequent shoots that
develop from the pruned side shoots should be cut once they have
two leaves. On the main branches, those that you train to the
support, leave a single shoot at the end to serve as a leader.
</P>
<P>
   In late winter, prune back half of the new growth on the leader
shoots, and prune the side shoots you pruned the previous summer to
just an inch or two from their bases. That way the overall growth
can be controlled and the side shoots will become flowering spurs
instead of a tangled, leafy mess.
</P>
<P>
   Wisteria is not a plant to be lazy about pruning. It has no
shame and will cover whatever is standing still in its path. Or
neighborhood. &QL;

HELLO, KITTY. IS IT REALLY YOU? 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hello Kitty's Cube Frenzy, published by New Kid Co; for Sony
Playstation; $39.95; for all ages.
</P>
<P>
   I was in third grade when Hello Kitty landed.
</P>
<P>
   First there was nothing, and then, suddenly, the Japanese
cartoon kitten was everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Hello Kitty's cuteness was irresistible. Her eyes, wide-spaced
black jellybeans, seemed to stare plaintively from a round white
face that had no mouth. Her whiskers weren't planted near her nose,
as they are on a normal cat. They sprang incongruously from the
sides of her head. ``Help!'' she seemed to plead. ``This is all
wrong! But I can't speak! I have no mouth!''
</P>
<P>
   Hello Kitty was soft, round, toothless, clawless and mute. She
was totally helpless, and that inspired a certain protectiveness
and affection and spurred a cultlike following among 8-year-old
girls.
</P>
<P>
   A tide of licensed merchandise inundated the school: Hello Kitty
combs, mirrors, pencil cases, notebooks, barrettes, coin purses,
watches, stickers, nail care kits, address books, packages of
tissues. Birthday parties became Hello Kitty swap meets where Hello
Kitty presents were given and Hello Kitty party favors were taken
away. No one could get enough.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, Hello Kitty has generated more than a
billion dollars in revenue for her Japanese parent, the Sanrio Co.
About 15,000 Hello Kitty products are on the market worldwide,
including a video game published by New Kid Co, Hello Kitty's Cube
Frenzy for the Sony Playstation.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing Hello Kitty has no mouth. Because if she saw
this game, the corners would fall into a sad, sad frown, and small
crystal-blue tears would drop out of her jelly-bean eyes. It is a
shallow, slapdash, boring little game, apparently thrown together
with no time and even less money.
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost, the game play is second-rate. Cube Frenzy is
a puzzle game with falling cubes in which Hello Kitty gets to
collect prizes. But despite the apparent similarities, Cube Frenzy
is to Tetris what Wonder Bread is to a French baguette.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are a lot of licensed titles that don't measure
up as thumb candy. But their mediocre game play is typically
mitigated by great graphics, whereas Cube Frenzy looks like bad
shareware _ or like a Game Boy cartridge blown up to television
size.
</P>
<P>
   Worse than the low resolution is the color scheme, which is
garishly awry. When you see Hello Kitty on a backpack or a piece of
stationery, a set of colors establishes the authenticity of the
product. It's immediately recognizable, just as a particular yellow
and a particular red add up to McDonald's. The video game jewel
tones in Cube Frenzy look nothing like the Hello Kitty palette, so
the whole experience feels somewhat off kilter.
</P>
<P>
   The whole point of a licensed video game is that it looks like
the thing it's based on. When designers miss the mark, it
disappoints the little kids who gobble up images of a well-loved
character and the nostalgic young adults who gobbled up those
images 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And with a character like Hello Kitty, it's especially
disappointing because Hello Kitty merchandise has usually been very
high quality. Nothing cracks or fades; all the snaps and closures
are snug. You pay more, but you get more _ in general, if you buy a
Hello Kitty comb or pen, it will be better than a generic comb or
pen.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the case with Cube Frenzy, which is a subpar video
game selling for a premium price, $39.95. Which is senseless
because you can get a much better Hello Kitty experience free on
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Sanrio's home page in Japan is a jewel box of Hello Kitty-ana,
with profiles of Hello Kitty and all her friends, comic strips, a
fortune teller and digital games and puzzles lifted from Hello
Kitty CD-ROM's that are available only in Japan
(www.sanrio.co.jp/english).
</P>
<P>
   There is also Psychology Fun Corner, a series of questions
designed to give you a better look at your own personality and your
relationships with others. (``You are playing hide-and-seek, but
you've hidden so well that no one can find you. How do you feel?'')
For kitsch, you can't beat a cartoon baby's heartfelt reading of
your inner life.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Sanrio headquarters, there are dozens of Hello Kitty
fan sites on the Web where you can dress up the characters and read
stories about them and chat and send postcards to your friends,
which is what 8-year-old girls want to do with Hello Kitty in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   When you survey the mammoth array of Hello Kitty products that
have been produced over the years, most of them fall into two basic
groups: things that have to do with personal appearance
(toothbrushes, barrettes, etc.) and things that have to do with
communication (pencils, pens, stationery and the carrying cases
that contain them).
</P>
<P>
   Among grade-school girls, stickers are a means of
self-expression and a tradable commodity. A Sanrio address book or
wallet may be a girl's first experience of keeping track of
information about other people or carrying money, which are adult
activities.
</P>
<P>
   The infantile cartoon characters may seem decorative, but
they're really functional. They're visual training wheels that
connect the world of grown-ups to the world of little kids. A Hello
Kitty pencil makes it easier for an 8-year-old to write a letter or
jot down a phone number.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, a Hello Kitty compact makes it easier for a
20-something not to take herself too seriously. In both cases, the
character makes the experience more comfortable and friendly. The
most important word in the Hello Kitty universe is ``hello.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frenzy'' is not part of the lexicon.

SKINNY LAPTOP, HEFTY KEYBOARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Portable computing, like life, has always been about compromise.
The smaller the computer gets, the more compromises have to be
made. It is like dieting: to lose pounds and girth, one often has
to bid adieu to some pleasures like extra-cheese pizza or double
chocolate mocha fudge cake. Life is hard.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is with IBM's new Thinkpad 240, the latest in a
relatively new class of portable computers called ultralights. It
is a Windows 98-based portable that weighs 3 pounds, measures about
10 inches wide and 8 inches deep, and is about an inch thick.
</P>
<P>
   The ultralight category was created by the Sony Corp. last
summer with its breakthrough Vaio Superslim 505 model. Similar
models are made by Toshiba, Sharp and Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   But just as not everyone dreams of being as skinny as Ally
McBeal, not everyone will be attracted to these ultralight
computers. It is a niche product for people with small niches. For
people who must travel a lot, need a full-powered computer and
dread carrying around the typical 7- to 9-pound notebook computer
all day, the ultralights have definite appeal, despite their
compromises.
</P>
<P>
   There are some compromises that are just too much for some
people to bear, however. In my case, I absolutely draw the line at
giving up cheeseburgers and comfortable computer keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   The Thinkpad 240, which will have a list price of $1,999 when it
goes on sale early next month, is the first ultralight model with a
keyboard that does not feel lifeless and cramped.
</P>
<P>
   It has a number of other nice features, of course, like a zippy
300-megahertz Celeron processor, 64 megabytes of RAM, a
6.4-gigabyte hard drive and a convenient selection of connection
ports, but the keyboard won me over. That, and the fact that it
easily slips into a briefcase or backpack that I can carry all day
and not suffer afterward.
</P>
<P>
   As with all the ultralights _ and even with the next-larger
class of machines called ultraportables, which generally weigh 4 to
6 pounds, measure about 12 inches by 9 inches and have 12-inch or
larger screens _ the Thinkpad 240 has compromises galore. The big
question is whether the compromises are worth the reduction in size
and weight, and that is a personal decision to be made after
consulting with one's trapeziums and deltoids.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the Thinkpad 240 achieves its lightness by
banishing the diskette and CD-ROM drives to the desktop. The
computer comes with an external diskette drive, but the CD drive is
a $289 option.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the 240 is a machine best suited to travelers who
get along on trips without needing external drives. After all, when
you tally the weight of an AC power adapter, external drives and
cables, the Thinkpad's travel weight comes to more than six pounds
_ not to mention the hassle of dealing with all the wires and
clutter.
</P>
<P>
   Those who need the CD drive frequently, even if only to listen
to audio CDs on an airplane, would probably be better off with a
larger (and only modestly heavier) portable that has built-in CD
and diskette drives.
</P>
<P>
   Ultralights also suffer from the trade-off between weight and
battery capacity. The average time between recharging for the
Thinkpad unit I tested was a very modest one and a half hours,
although you can double that by adding more weight to the computer
and lightening your wallet by $189 (for an optional double-capacity
battery).
</P>
<P>
   The Thinkpad's bright, liquid crystal display screen is 10.4
inches measured diagonally, which is about as small as today's
World Wide Web and Windows users will tolerate. It has a maximum
resolution of 800 pixels by 600 pixels (known as SVGA), which I
found to be adequate for my most common tasks of word processing,
handling e-mail and browsing the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The Sony and other ultralight competitors achieve higher
resolutions (1,024 by 768, or XGA) on their small screens, which
comes in handy for working with detailed graphic images, but can
reduce the size of text.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Ultralights also tend to be lightweights when it comes to
processing power, at least in comparison to larger portables. The
Intel Corp. just announced the availability of mobile Celeron and
Pentium II chips operating at 400 megahertz, and we could see
mobile Pentium III systems before long _ but those chips will show
up first in larger, heavier and more expensive portables.
</P>
<P>
   The 300-MHz Celeron in the Thinkpad 240 is a nice step up from
the mobile Pentium MMX chips used in the first generation of
ultralights. The MMX chips are at the end of their life cycle.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the ultralights cheat by moving their serial,
parallel and video ports onto a separate gizmo called a port
replicator. In general, the replicators can stay on the desktop
when the computer goes in the travel bag.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Thinkpad 240 eliminates the need for a replicator
attachment altogether by offering a nice array of built-in ports.
</P>
<P>
   Included are a serial port for attaching a Palm Pilot or other
connected device, a parallel printer port, a video port (for
attaching an external monitor), a diskette drive port, one
Universal Serial Bus port, a mouse port (for those who prefer a
mouse over the Thinkpad's built-in pointer on the keyboard), an
infrared communications port for wireless printing to
infrared-equipped printers or other wireless data transfers, and
holes for stereo headphones, a microphone and external speakers.
</P>
<P>
   There is also an internal 56K modem, and a single PC card slot
that can be used for add-ons like the CD drive or an Ethernet
network adapter ($349 from the International Business Machines
Corp., but much cheaper from other vendors).
</P>
<P>
   The built-in ports are nice, but the keyboard is really the
thing that sets the Thinkpad apart from other ultralights, said J.
Gerry Purdy, president of Mobile Insights, a consulting company in
Mountain View, Calif. ``The keyboard is the most difficult thing to
get right in this category,'' Purdy noted.
</P>
<P>
   With a desktop computer, if you don't like the keyboard, you can
replace it at a relatively modest cost. With a notebook computer,
however, you're stuck. So, if typing is going to be the prime
activity on the computer, it's important to spend time testing the
keyboard before you buy.
</P>
<P>
   The typical portable computer keyboard has a pitch of 19
millimeters, the distance between the centers of adjacent keys. One
of the compromises Sony made in designing the original Vaio 505
ultralight was to shrink the keyboard pitch to 17 millimeters and
reduce the distance the keys travel when depressed, to the point
that typing on the Vaio 505 felt scrunched and brittle.
</P>
<P>
   And the Sony is actually better than some other ultralights.
(Sony has just introduced a couple of Vaio models that offer bigger
keyboards and bigger screens, and some intriguing new features, but
at the cost of higher weight and price.)
</P>
<P>
   On the Thinkpad 240, IBM has managed to retain a key pitch of 18
millimeters, a millimeter more than the Sony, but still noticeable
even to those of us who type with two fingers. The key travel is
also deeper, the equivalent of walking on plush carpet after
standing on bare floors.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, there are compromises on the keyboard, too. The one that
drives me crazy is the half-size Tab key, located where the Caps
Lock key (which was left off) normally resides on other keyboards.
But hey, I'm willing to compromise, too. I can put up with a
temporary cramp in my left pinky if it means avoiding the
spine-twisting cramps and aches that come from carrying a heavier
portable.

EARLY REVIEWS OF BUSH'S SHOW LOOK PRETTY GOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The naysayers were ready to pounce, poised to derail the
campaign before it ever got rolling. The pundits were figuring that
they might shut down the presidential ambitions of George W. Bush
the same way that theater critics sometimes force an overhyped
Broadway show to close after one performance.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the Texas governor foiled the critics' plans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's detractors in politics and the media have been
underestimating him since the day he decided to take on the
allegedly unbeatable Ann Richards in the 1994 race for governor.
Bush beat Richards without breaking a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Bush was re-elected with nearly 70 percent of the
vote. He racked up enthusiastic support from just about every
category of voter for whom a category exists. He followed his
election victory with a successful legislative session that saw
most of his campaign promises enacted into law.
</P>
<P>
   And still the skeptics scoffed at the polls declaring Bush the
front-runner for president _ not just among Republicans seeking
their party's nomination but in head-to-head matchups against
Democrats Al Gore and Bill Bradley. He's untested outside Texas,
they said. Nobody knows what he stands for, they said. He hasn't
felt the heat of the national media spotlight, they said.
</P>
<P>
   So Bush boarded an airplane dubbed ``Great Expectations'' and
set out to see how his message would play in Peoria. Well, not in
Peoria just yet, but in Iowa and New Hampshire. And it played just
fine.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most skeptical media types had no choice but to report
that Bush's opening foray into the arena of presidential politics
was successful. Big crowds showed up at every stop to look him over
and listen to what he had to say. The crowds liked what they saw
and heard.
</P>
<P>
   It was just one trip, of course. There are lots more trips to
come, more states to visit, more hands to shake, more backs to pat,
more reporters to joust with.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush keeps reminding us: It's a long way till voting time.
</P>
<P>
   But rarely has a candidate commanded so much attention so early
in the process. Or so much fear, where his rivals are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   According to news reports, Democrats have been following Bush
around on the campaign trail, launching verbal hand grenades and
hoping to catch him in a blunder. Republicans are sniping at him as
well, perhaps in the futile expectation that the sparks given off
by the Bush juggernaut will ignite their dormant campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The most persistent criticism of Bush is that he hasn't been
specific enough in articulating his positions on various issues. He
has acknowledged the criticism but has stuck to his plan,
describing his philosophy in general terms and promising to deliver
details ``on my timetable.''
</P>
<P>
   This is how Bush operates. He cannot be pressured into doing or
saying anything that he is not ready to do or say.
</P>
<P>
   And this we know from past performance: His proposals on issues
such as taxes, education, crime, etc., will be detailed and more
than specific enough to satisfy voters, if not the media. When the
people of Texas elected Bush governor in 1994 and again in 1998,
they knew exactly what he intended to do.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign rhetoric and political punditry aside, the American
people will have no doubts where Bush stands on the issues when the
time comes to choose a new president.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, these people who are counting on Bush to stumble _
to lose his temper or lose his cool or lose whatever it is they
expect him to lose _ would be wise not to hold their breath. Ann
Richards tried every trick in the book to get Bush's goat in that
first gubernatorial campaign, and he just plain refused to play her
game.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has shown repeatedly that he can deal with relentless
scrutiny by the media, cheap shots from opponents and tough
questions from the public. He wasn't rattled by hecklers in New
Hampshire, and he won't be rattled by carping pundits or braying
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Time magazine featured the words on its cover: ``President
Bush?''
</P>
<P>
   The question mark is temporary.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 Copyright 1999 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: My bedroom door sticks when I try to close it due to swelling
of the wood, so I want to take the door off and plane down the
edge. When I tried this before I had a lot of trouble holding the
door on edge while I worked, so I had to enlist my wife to hold it
in position while I planed it. That didn't work too well. How can I
do the job this time while working by myself?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are two methods often used when planing or sanding the
edge of a door. One method is to lay the door on edge, then push
one end of the door into a corner of the room while planing from
the other end. The second method is to use a couple of carpenter's
handscrew clamps similar to the ones shown here _ which enables you
to plane the full length of the door without having to turn it
end-for-end about half way through the job. Lock two of these
clamps firmly onto the bottom edge of the door (the edge that is
resting on the floor) then lay the door on edge with the clamps on
the floor. This will support the door so you can plane or sand the
full length of the door.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a steam heating system and the large radiator in my
upstairs hall makes a banging noise when the heat comes up. Also,
it often makes a bubbling sound, something like water gurgling,
while the heat is on. Can you tell me what causes this, and is
there anything I can do about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: After the steam enters the radiator and releases its heat
some of it will condense into water which then accumulates inside
the bottom of the radiator. This water is supposed to run out of
the radiator and then flow back to the boiler through the same
pipes. If the radiator slopes the wrong way, or if the main inlet
valve is not fully open, water can get trapped inside the radiator
and cause the gurgling noise you describe. In some cases there will
also be a banging sound as the incoming steam comes against the
water inside the radiator. You can often correct this problem by
shimming up the end of the radiator that is opposite the inlet
valve so that it slopes slightly toward the inlet valve.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am building a wood deck and shed and have to drive a number
of long, heavy wood screws through some large beams. I am working
in a rural area, I don't have electricity for power tools, and
can't afford to buy a heavy duty cordless screwdriver that I may
never need again (assuming one of these would do the job). Driving
each screw in by hand is so hard that I get blisters and have to
rest after each screw. Is there anything you can think of that will
make the screws penetrate more easily?
</P>
<P>
   A: It sounds as though you are not drilling pilot holes of the
right size for each screw. For such large screws you may need a
larger clearance hole where the screw goes through the first wood
member, and then a smaller pilot hole in the second member. This
makes it easier to drive the screws in and helps prevent splitting.
It is a good idea, too, to rub the screw threads over a cake of
soap beforehand in order to lubricate the threads, and thus also
make the screws easier to drive in.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our bathroom vanity sink is made of a ``cultured'' or
synthetic marble with the sink molded in so that the whole top is
one piece. The bottom of this sink has numerous stains in it that
won't come out with regular detergent. I don't want to spend the
money to replace the entire vanity and sink. Is there any
suggestion you can offer to clean up or just replace the sink?
</P>
<P>
   A: You might try scrubbing the stains out with a mildly abrasive
cleaner such as Soft Scrub or similar product that also contains a
bleach. Or, you could try using just a bleach alone. In extreme
cases stubborn stains can even be removed by using an abrasive type
fiberglass cleaner or auto cleaner, or even a kitchen abrasive pad.
These will dull the finish a little, but you can restore the luster
with a waterproof wax _ the kind that is used on fiberglass boats
(any wax will wear off and have to be renewed in time).

GARDEN NOTEBOOK: MAKING AN ENTRANCE INTO AN EDEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MARTHA BAKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's easy to forget that the domestic doorway was once a humble,
utilitarian affair, innocent of any attempt to make a good first
impression or, for that matter, any impression at all. In medieval
castles, entrances were simply holding tanks designed to check the
advance of sudden callers bearing arms and a grievance. Equally
functional (and hardly more welcoming) was the cupboard-size entry
porch common to early New England. It was, in fact, a barrier
against front-door drafts, as well as the only sensible place to
put the staircase. Even in a less buttoned-up age, the front hall
is likely to be the family repository of umbrellas, coats and the
odd 10-speed.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, homeowners are increasingly conscious of
the first-impression potential of these little entry rooms, and
where trends in interiors go, garden style follows. The notion
makes perfect sense: a gateway, or introduction to a garden can
create a sense of drama or stir curiosity about what lies beyond.
And as in an interior foyer, the first impression created by a
garden entrance depends on what you want to make it.
</P>
<P>
   For the owners of a seaside property in Montauk, N.Y., the
gateway is the garden, the serendipitous result of a plan to
relocate an inconvenient driveway. As the driveway was originally
configured, arriving guests confronted the bedroom cottage. But
when Craig Socia, a landscape designer, was asked to divert the
drive to a lower level so that it would lead, more logically, to
the living and dining complex, he also connected the two points
with a special kind of garden and a stairway rooted in nature.
</P>
<P>
   Using plants and materials indigenous to the hostile Montauk
environment, with its salt spray and Atlantic gales, Socia laid a
pathway of hardwood mulch, then created a border with shad trees
and plantings of summer sweet, which bear spires of pale pink
flowers. Next, he built a stairway with grass treads and risers of
rubble stones, which former owners had gathered from the beach and
scattered through the woods, a lucky find, as it's now illegal to
remove such stones from the shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors step off the drive onto a mysterious path, where Gothic
tree limbs thrash against the sky, and a stairway entices them
upward until they discover the surprise payoff in a spectacular
view of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   On the Sagaponack, N.Y., property of David Seeler and his wife,
Ngaere Macray, who own Bayberry Nursery, there's another garden
entrance that doesn't lay all its cards on the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's meant to be a transitional space, like a foyer to the
garden,'' Seeler explained. The design is simplicity itself, a
solid wood gate with a curved top joining two beech hedge walls,
but the impact is powerful. Beyond the gate lies another hedge
wall, the first in a series of mazelike arrangements at whose core
is the garden itself.
</P>
<P>
   Some entryways frame a portion of the garden as a kind of
horticultural hors d'oeuvre to whet the appetite for what's to
come. Such is the case in a Dutchess County, N.Y., garden where the
owner has put a classically rendered entrance gate to offer an
elliptical view of the garden's focal statuary and the plantings
that surround it.
</P>
<P>
   Another framing device is a Chinese-inspired cutout, a portal
with a novel shape hewn from a solid border or dividing wall. One
especially charming example is a circular moon gate discovered on a
family estate in Seal Harbor, Maine Separating a sunny
Western-style flower garden from a tranquil enclave for Eastern
sculpture, the gate draws the viewer from light into shade, allegro
to adagio. The agreeably befuddling sensation of the transition is
pure Alice.
</P>
<P>
   Spirit screens, unrevealing blank walls, are another Eastern
innovation, once the means of entry to China's minute medieval
gardens. Spiritually, they were a signal for visitors to abandon
all negative thoughts. Strategically, they directed entrants to the
right, then onto a pattern of walkways leading up, down and around
the garden, a virtual reality ploy that made the garden seem larger
than it actually was.
</P>
<P>
   Often, a garden's site will be the best guide to the choice and
placement of a gateway. In a seaside locale, for example, a
gardener might choose an open-work design, which captures the
seascape, as the owners of an Asian-themed garden did in Pemaquid
on the Maine coast. After establishing their waterside boundary
with a see-through fence and a striking latticework dragon gate,
they fashioned a doorway that visually enlarges their garden space
by appropriating the seascape behind it.
</P>
<P>
   Another example of an entry suited to its setting can be seen on
a multileveled property in Westchester County, N.Y., belonging to
James Huniford and Stephen Sills. Having recreated a classic
17th-century parterre on a terrace, they devised a stone stairway,
capped with two stone finials threaded with vines. What makes the
stairway the perfect access for this garden is its classic air,
which serves as preamble to the formal garden.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the whimsical side of classic, which is a fitting
description of an Old World garden that Michael Trapp, a landscape
architect, improvised on his property in Connecticut. For the
entryway, he assembled architectural remnants _ arched, louvered
doors and two ancient-looking Ionic columns _ then bedecked his
contrivance with a mismatched pair of potted plants. The effect
suggests a faded grandeur that's as welcoming as a smile.
</P>
<P>
   As a landscape artist, Lisa Stamm believes that garden entrances
should be strong directional statements that leave visitors in no
doubt about where they're supposed to go. As the owner of nine
acres of heaven on which the driveway stops well short of the
garden that surrounds the house, she's doubly convinced of it.
</P>
<P>
   Her solution was an entryway designed and built by Dale Booher,
an architect who is her husband and her partner in a landscape
design business on Shelter Island in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Cushioned between two wings of a high privet hedge, an arched
gate (once the front door of their 200-year-old house) and its
squared-off frame are painted the same Benjamin Moore chrome green
as the trim on the house, visually uniting them. ``I like the
contrast of the small, narrow gate with the large expanse of garden
it opens into,'' Booher said.
</P>
<P>
   Hung from the gate are old bells, which announce callers.
Flanking it are two Spanish olive jar planters. Ms. Stamm restocks
them yearly with one or another of her favorite plant varieties,
which are all structured, long lasting and suited to shady growing
conditions. Put it all together, and you've got a garden entrance
whose function is unmistakable, and utterly compelling.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, anyone who's intent on keeping all entrances covered
might draw inspiration from the Manhattan penthouse terrace of
Samuel Sachs, director of the Frick Collection. Perched on each of
the two brick columns marking the fire escape exit from his garden
is a cheery urnful of lobelia. Which only goes to show that in new
age castles, even uninvited callers rate the courtesy of an
inviting entryway.

IN OLMSTED'S FOOTSTEPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ANNE RAVER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As boaters clunked their oars on the lake, Witold
Rybczynski folded his big frame onto a little chair by a tiny cafe
table at the boathouse and talked about how he came to write about
the man who created Central Park almost a century and a half ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I thought about the notion of biography first,'' said
Rybczynski, whose new book, ``A Clearing in the Distance: Frederick
Law Olmsted and America in the 19th Century'' (Scribner, $28),
takes an intimate look at the man who first joined the words
landscape and architecture and created an art.
</P>
<P>
   ``My books tend to ramble on about things,'' said Rybczynski,
56, an architect who has written eight personable, philosophical
books, including ``The Most Beautiful House in the World'' (Viking,
1989), in which the writer falls in love with the idea of building
a boat, which then needs a boathouse, which somehow turns into a
house, and on and on like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``At last the house gets built,'' said Rybczynski (pronounced
rib-CHIN-skee), staring down at his salmon over wilted greens, with
a contemplative air. ``And with a biography, at last the person
dies at the end, and the book stops.''
</P>
<P>
   The waiter arrived with the fresh pepper. ``What kind of greens
are these?'' Rybczynski asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arugula,'' the waiter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' Rybczynski said, tucking this new information behind his
high, broad forehead.
</P>
<P>
   So then, the question was, whom to write about without getting
bored halfway through researching this person's life.
</P>
<P>
   Rybczynski, a professor of urbanism at the University of
Pennsylvania, thought about all the architects in the world. They
live boring lives: ``They work,'' the architect said. ``They sit at
their desks. And they don't write anything down.''
</P>
<P>
   He needed someone who had kept journals captivating enough to
keep your head from hitting the desk in the archives room.
</P>
<P>
   Then he read an essay about Olmsted. The man had been a surveyor
and farmer. A journalist and abolitionist. He'd run the Federal
Sanitary Commission, the precursor to the Red Cross, during the
Civil War. Managed a gold mine in California and faced down a mob
of striking miners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't the conventional life of a landscape architect,''
said Rybczynski, who plunged into Olmsted's papers _ and discovered
the man could write!
</P>
<P>
   Here is the young farmer, on his first trip to England in 1850,
overwhelmed by the countryside _ ``green, dripping, glistening,
gorgeous,'' the hawthorn hedges, ``the mild sun beaming through the
watery atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is his description of Eaton Hall, a large estate in
Cheshire: ``A gentle undulating surface of close-cropped pasture
land, reaching way off illimitably; very old, but not very large
trees scattered singly and in groups _ so far apart as to throw
long, unbroken shadows across broad openings of light, and leave
the view in several directions unobstructed for a long distance.''
</P>
<P>
   All the elements, in other words, that Rybczynski would discover
in his own journey through Olmsted's parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I educated myself,'' he said as we left the cafe and wended
our way along the lake toward Belvedere Terrace. ``At first, I
didn't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   He gestured toward the Lake, which Olmsted had carved out of a
swamp. ``At first, it's just trees and water,'' he said. ``You
don't realize what is going on in terms of composition and light.
You tend to be more impressed by the Mall and the terrace, because
you can see them.''
</P>
<P>
   As we mounted the staircase, Rybczynski pointed out the
intricate carvings of fruit, vines, flowers and birds that Jacob
Mould had carved into the stairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were allegorical themes,'' he said, ``like the four
seasons, the six continents.''
</P>
<P>
   At the edge of the Mall, as the shade of the great elms gave way
to the sunlit terrace, in-line skaters zigzagged in and out of the
orange markers of their makeshift course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Olmsted would have had lots of suggestions how to deal
with the new things in his parks, like the skaters and car
traffic,'' Rybczynski said. ``But I don't think he thought of tall
buildings. He wanted it so you couldn't see anything but the
trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Central Park was the first baby step of a genius.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not only learning about landscape architecture but how
to make an 800-acre park,'' Rybczynski said. ``Nobody in America
had done anything this big.''
</P>
<P>
   Olmsted's works of art, like Prospect Park and Biltmore, the
6,000-acre Vanderbilt estate near Asheville, N.C., were yet to
come. So were the magnificent parks and leafy parkways Olmsted
created in Boston and Buffalo; the suburbs he designed like
Riverside, Ill.; the scenic drives and lookouts at Yosemite and
Niagara Falls.
</P>
<P>
   As Rybczynski points out in his book, Olmsted saw the grandeur
of Yosemite as a powerful civilizing force. ``In his era, people
believed, literally, in the healing powers of nature,'' he said. By
building parks that brought them closer to the earth, Olmsted left
a lasting gift to America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The genius of Olmsted was that he did these large things,''
Rybczynski said. ``He gave structure to the city, so it couldn't be
changed easily. Then he accepted that it would be in-filled by
commercial forces. He laid out the big parks and parkways and then
let people follow their own course. He understood that you couldn't
regulate that. It's too much of a free-for-all.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Without any formal training _ just the skills he learned as a
farmer and surveyor _ but with an innate feeling for powerful
landscapes, Olmsted forged a vision that was near clairvoyant. He
foresaw a time when New Yorkers would need a bit of artificial
wilderness to escape the stress of city life, and when millions of
Americans would flock to Yosemite seeking a fragment of real
wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   When Olmsted and the architect Calvert Vaux won the design
competition for Central Park in 1857, it was a long, narrow strip
of rocky bluffs to the north and swamps to the south, with an
unsightly old reservoir in the middle. Not good for real estate
development, in other words. But nothing that a few thousand
workers with horses and mules and a little vision couldn't fix.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they created this Mall, it was a very formal urban
space,'' Rybczynski said. ``But they tilted it slightly, so it goes
across on a diagonal, not straight up and down, so you look out
across the water toward the trees on the bluff.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he turned to look across the lake and grumbled, ``The
boathouse ruins the view.'' The original Victorian boathouse was
smaller in scale and enhanced, the illusion of distance, from the
top of the terrace to the rocky bluffs of the Ramble, rather than
dispelling it.
</P>
<P>
   If you try really hard to ignore the skyscrapers (though some
think them almost cozy, rising out of the trees), you could be in
the Adirondacks, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   We walked on to the Ramble, looking for a rustic shelter we knew
was there, and got lost. We found two park employees, who got into
a heated discussion over where it was (``The east side!'' ``No, no!
The west side!'') The Ramble was doing its job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Olmsted took the English country park, which is very refined,
and translated it into something much rougher and more American,''
Rybczynski said. ``And he put it in the middle of New York City,
which is very strange.''
</P>
<P>
   And democracy is its soul. ``You can go into it from everywhere
_ there is no grand entrance,'' he said. ``The way you enter is on
the scale of the individual. Certainly his intention was to create
an equalizing meeting place where everybody rubs shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah. Dogs swimming (without their leashes!), jogging moms
pushing baby carriages, photographers fussing over brides, in-line
skaters in the Ramble, Stuart Little sailing his boat (``Who?''
Rybczynski asked).
</P>
<P>
   If Olmsted could see us now.

 &HT;    SOFTWARE HEADS FOR TOP ROLE IN U.S. ECONOMY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
 &HT;    By Andrew J. Glass
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON The digital code that powers the nation's computers
provided a record $141 billion upward kick to the domestic economy,
according to a study released Wednesday by a key software trade
group.
</P>
<P>
   Given current trends, the software industry's overall share of
the U.S. economy will surpass that of car, truck and motor vehicle
makers beginning in 2000, the Business Software Alliance reported.
That would mean that software makers, led by such industry giants
as Microsoft Corp., will next year exceed the value of all other
manufacturing groups in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Flush from a year that saw overall sales rise by 17.8 percent,
most of the top executives of the 18 software firms which belong to
the group spent much of the week in closed sessions with
administration and congressional leaders, pursuing their high-tech
agenda. Since the alliance's members include an ever-shifting
universe of partners and rivals, some of the most sensitive issues
facing the industry remain out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   In opening a press conference to report how the ``software
industry has emerged as one of the fastest-growing and most vibrant
segments of the U.S. economy,'' Robert Holleyman, the trade group's
president, made it clear that no questions about Microsoft's
antitrust problems with the Justice Department and 19 states would
be in order. Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, seated to Holleyman's
left, beamed with evident pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Gates did allow, however, that ``the level of dialogue with the
Congress and the executive branch has increased quite
dramatically'' in recent years. ``The Congress,'' he added, ``is
listening to this industry very well.''
</P>
<P>
   On his appointed rounds, the Microsoft co-founder has ridden
several times past the sandstone federal courthouse on Constitution
Avenue where the antitrust trial has entered a final and, possibly,
decisive phase. But his time has been otherwise spent joining the
Democrats for their weekly policy lunch, testifying before a
Republican-led technology summit of the Joint Economic Committee
and engaging in a photo-op for a a minority youth computer
education grant.
</P>
<P>
   The receptive political climate that Gates and his fellow
industry leaders found in Washington on both sides of the aisle had
been paved by increasingly generous wallets.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997-1998 campaign season alone, technology companies
contributed nearly $9 million to congressional candidates. That sum
was double the 1993-94 election total. Moreover, and the industry
seems poised to up the ante even further for the 2000
</P>
<P>
   election, according to Holly Bailey of the Center for Responsive
Politics, a watchdog group that monitors money in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``As time goes on, high tech is becoming an increasingly
prominent contributor,'' Bailey said. ``Anything that concerns the
computer industry is getting a big ear in Congress these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides releasing the report, the software group utilized the
press session to highlight its Washington agenda. Each executive in
turn, including Gates, tackled such matters as the need for
increased copyright protection, the need to end encryption export
restrictions, the Y2K computer glitch, digital signatures and
related privacy concerns and the rapid growth of electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The study commissioned from Nathan Associates revealed that in
1998, the industry
</P>
<P>
   had 806,900 employees. It now has workers in every state who
earn an average of $68,900 a year. By contrast, other workers in
the private sector earn an average of $29,800 a year.
</P>
<P>
   It also also found that spending by the industry and its
employees stimulated a major ripple effect of economic activities

 &HT;    SOFTWARE HEADS FOR TOP ROLE IN U.S. ECONOMY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
 &HT;    By Andrew J. Glass
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON The digital code that powers the nation's computers
provided a record $141 billion upward kick to the domestic economy,
according to a study released Wednesday by a key software trade
group.
</P>
<P>
   Given current trends, the software industry's overall share of
the U.S. economy will surpass that of car, truck and motor vehicle
makers beginning in 2000, the Business Software Alliance reported.
That would mean that software makers, led by such industry giants
as Microsoft Corp., will next year exceed the value of all other
manufacturing groups in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Flush from a year that saw overall sales rise by 17.8 percent,
most of the top executives of the 18 software firms which belong to
the group spent much of the week in closed sessions with
administration and congressional leaders, pursuing their high-tech
agenda. Since the alliance's members include an ever-shifting
universe of partners and rivals, some of the most sensitive issues
facing the industry remain out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   In opening a press conference to report how the ``software
industry has emerged as one of the fastest-growing and most vibrant
segments of the U.S. economy,'' Robert Holleyman, the trade group's
president, made it clear that no questions about Microsoft's
antitrust problems with the Justice Department and 19 states would
be in order. Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, seated to Holleyman's
left, beamed with evident pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Gates did allow, however, that ``the level of dialogue with the
Congress and the executive branch has increased quite
dramatically'' in recent years. ``The Congress,'' he added, ``is
listening to this industry very well.''
</P>
<P>
   On his appointed rounds, the Microsoft co-founder has ridden
several times past the sandstone federal courthouse on Constitution
Avenue where the antitrust trial has entered a final and, possibly,
decisive phase. But his time has been otherwise spent joining the
Democrats for their weekly policy lunch, testifying before a
Republican-led technology summit of the Joint Economic Committee
and engaging in a photo-op for a a minority youth computer
education grant.
</P>
<P>
   The receptive political climate that Gates and his fellow
industry leaders found in Washington on both sides of the aisle had
been paved by increasingly generous wallets.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997-1998 campaign season alone, technology companies
contributed nearly $9 million to congressional candidates. That sum
was double the 1993-94 election total. Moreover, and the industry
seems poised to up the ante even further for the 2000
</P>
<P>
   election, according to Holly Bailey of the Center for Responsive
Politics, a watchdog group that monitors money in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``As time goes on, high tech is becoming an increasingly
prominent contributor,'' Bailey said. ``Anything that concerns the
computer industry is getting a big ear in Congress these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides releasing the report, the software group utilized the
press session to highlight its Washington agenda. Each executive in
turn, including Gates, tackled such matters as the need for
increased copyright protection, the need to end encryption export
restrictions, the Y2K computer glitch, digital signatures and
related privacy concerns and the rapid growth of electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The study commissioned from Nathan Associates revealed that in
1998, the industry
</P>
<P>
   had 806,900 employees. It now has workers in every state who
earn an average of $68,900 a year. By contrast, other workers in
the private sector earn an average of $29,800 a year.
</P>
<P>
   It also also found that spending by the industry and its
employees stimulated a major ripple effect of economic activities
in other sectors of the economy. Thus, after taking the multiplier
effect into account, the demand for software employed 2.7 million
people earning $128 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   On the negative side, the industry estimates that currently, one
out of every four software applications are illegally loaded on
computers.
</P>
<P>
   The trade group estimates that in 1998 software theft resulted
in 109,000 lost jobs, $4.5 billion in lost wages and $991 million
in lost tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enactment and enforcement of strong copyright laws around
the world have already reduced rampant software piracy, estimated
to cost nearly $11 billion in key global markets,'' said Holleyman.
``In just eight of the world's largest software markets, by
</P>
<P>
   reducing piracy rates from their 1992 levels to the levels
experienced in 1998, our industry was able to realize nearly $4
billion in additional software sales in these eight markets in 1998
alone.''

MICROPROCESSOR CHAMELEONS CAN CHANGE FUNCTIONS QUICKLY TO
ACCOMMODATE NEW TASKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Va.)   (af)  
 By IAN AUSTEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Pentium and Power PC chips that run most personal computers
are the Swiss Army knives of the microprocessor world. They can
take on a huge variety of tasks, but as anyone who has tried to
carve a turkey using a pocket knife will attest, specialized tools
make faster work of some jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The same rule applies to the computer world. Even on PCs, some
difficult jobs need help. The video cards on most personal
computers are, in effect, custom-made chips. But making custom
chips can pose a problem for hardware manufacturers; while
multimedia standards are rapidly shifting, designing and producing
a custom chip can take up to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   But a new generation of programmable chips, faster and used in
place of custom chips, could get around that problem.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional chips are operated by programs containing
step-by-step instructions that are designed to work with the chip's
fixed circuits. But the circuits of programmable chips can be, in
effect, rewired by software to convert them into special-purpose
processors. Their roles aren't fixed.
</P>
<P>
   These chameleons of the chip world can be changed or upgraded an
infinite number of times within a fraction of a second by using new
pieces of software. In theory at least, programmable chips could
have the versatility of general-purpose processors but avoid the
instant obsolescence that plagues most electronics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantages are incredible,'' said Jonathan Rose, a
professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the
University of Toronto who has researched the chips for more than a
decade. ``This offers much more than a little improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those advantages is speed. While a customized chip can
take up to 18 months to produce, a programmable chip, once its
software is designed, can be modified in less than one-thousandth
of a second.
</P>
<P>
   With programmable chips, operators have to come up with, in
effect, a wiring diagram that turns the chip into a machine
designed for handling a particular application. Unlike conventional
chips, programmable chips can be reprogrammed on the fly for, say,
decoding video, then for another task, like voice recognition, when
another batch of software arrives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those very radical changes,'' said Sandeep Vij,
a vice president of Xilinx, a programmable-chip maker based in San
Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Programmable chips can be thought of as a return to the early
days of computing. While pioneering computers like the Eniac used
programs, they also had to be physically rewired for different
tasks using plug-in cables. Programmable chips replicate that at
the level of the microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
   Programmable chips have been relatively slow to catch on: Xilinx
sold the world's first commercial programmable chip 15 years ago.
In the early days, the chips were mostly bought by companies that
made specialized products in small numbers, like huge industrial
machinery for automobile assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Such machines needed the performance of custom chips, but
designing and making custom chips, at a cost of $500,000 to $1
million, didn't make sense for a small number of units. The
programmable chips themselves are not expensive _ between $5 and
$100 _ making customization for particular tasks affordable and, as
a bonus, making updating possible.
</P>
<P>
   The chips could soon make their way into consumer gadgets and
PCs because of falling prices for programmable chips and
improvements in their software and performance. The Internet is
making that transition both possible and necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Multimedia files like digital video are exactly the sort of
material that benefit from the increased performance a programmable
chip offers. Gadgets can be modified to meet new standards or offer
new features even after they are manufactured.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as a company has an idea, they can put it on a chip
and ship the product,'' Vij said. Over the next year, Vij added,
cellular phones with Internet data capability and computer
accessories like printers are likely to begin making extensive use
of programmable chips.
</P>
<P>
   It is also widely expected that the set-top boxes that cable
companies will use for delivering digital television and data to
homes will also come laden with programmable chips. Such a set-top
box, for example, would allow a customer to download software from
a cable company to customize its circuits for only the services the
customer gets.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, cable companies could easily move to new
technical standards by sending out new hardware configurations to
the programmable chips in their customers' boxes rather than
physically shipping new units.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that some consumer products could eventually find
extended lives through programmable chips. High-end cameras with
such chips, for example, could receive new features or upgrade
their performance by being plugged into a computer that has
downloaded new configuration software from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Peter Athanas, leader of a programmable chip software
group at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,
said there were still some unresolved issues. ``This isn't quite
there yet,'' he said. To start with, the time it currently takes
programmable chips to ``rewire'' themselves can lead to sluggish
performance in some applications. Even though chips can respond to
new software instruction in hundredths of a millisecond, that ``is
years in processor time,'' Athanas said.
</P>
<P>
   But a more important hurdle, Athanas said, is the complexity
involved in creating the software necessary to reprogram a chip
(something beyond the capacity of nearly all consumers). Currently,
it is virtually the same process chip makers follow when designing
new chips. For ambitious and complex projects, that process can
involve a great deal of time and demand highly skilled programmers.
``We need some kind of conceptual leap,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Athanas is confident that both problems will be solved, which
could lead to significant changes. Researchers are already working
on fully configurable computers, which would be completely based on
programmable chips.
</P>
<P>
   Computers with such chips, if they proved workable, could be
very fast. But they would not work with current software. And Rose,
at the University of Toronto, said such machines would most likely
be used for only specific future applications like computer vision,
not for common consumer applications.
</P>
<P>
   Athanas agreed that programmable chips were unlikely to become
the engines of ordinary computers. ``You're not going to replace
your Pentium computer with one of these things,'' he said. ``Intel
shouldn't be worried.''

NATO TRIUMPH WOULD HAVE PLEASED ONE OF ITS FOUNDERS, HARRY TRUMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 20)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The deeds of presidents past often manifest
themselves in the achievements of presidents present.
</P>
<P>
   That's the case with the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization in 1949 during the presidency of Harry Truman and
NATO'S victory over evil in Kosovo in 1999 during the tenure of
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   On June 11, the day after Serbian forces began their melancholy
exit from Kosovo and NATO troops prepared to take up their
peace-keeping duties in that battered land, a jubilant Clinton
proclaimed to a military audience in Missouri that Truman would be
very pleased with the outcome of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   It is always risky to attribute sentiments to individuals who
are no longer alive. But in this instance it is safe to say that
Truman would be proud of the way NATO forced a murderous dictator
like Slobodan Milosevic to end his cruelty toward innocent
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The plain-spoken Missourian, who served as a field artillery
captain in World War I and headed a Senate committee that monitored
defense procurement during World War II, had no trouble
differentiating good from evil and opposing the latter.
</P>
<P>
   He would recognize in Clinton's castigation by political critics
vestiges of the troubles he faced during a tumultuous presidency
that encompassed seven years and nine months from the end of World
War II through the beginning years of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Truman would be familiar with the political games played by
today's naysayers, who refuse to admit they were wrong about the
air campaign that forced Milosevic to capitulate and who decline to
commend Clinton for his steadfast support of that campaign. Truman
would see them as reincarnations of the myopic politicians who
opposed his historic efforts to provide life-saving aid to the
victims of Nazi Germany after World War II and of the Soviet Union
during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Those critics were the ones who in Truman's day contended that
America had no business providing aid to communist-threatened
Greece and Turkey, creating the Marshall Plan to rebuild
war-shattered Europe, establishing NATO as a bastion against
communist aggression, breaking Moscow's blockade of Berlin in 1948
with U.S. air power and seeking United Nations endorsement of the
U.S. decision to oppose communist encroachment into South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   As some Republicans on Capitol Hill branded the campaign against
Milosevic ``Clinton's war,'' those of the 1950s called the fight
against the communists in Korea ``Truman's war.''
</P>
<P>
   Truman would not be surprised either by Russia's duplicitous
actions in Kosovo. He learned first-hand how Soviet dictator Josef
Stalin brutally broke commitments he made to Truman at Potsdam,
Germany, in the summer of 1945 and, earlier that year, to Franklin
D. Roosevelt at Yalta in the old Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Truman almost certainly would applaud NATO's growth in size and
power.
</P>
<P>
   When the NATO treaty was signed in 1949, it marked the first
time the United States had entered into a military alliance with
other countries. America, Canada and 10 Western European nations
were the original members.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kosovo campaign, 19 NATO nations stood as one. In
addition, the alliance, which was founded to protect Western Europe
from communist aggression, fought its first war against a
non-member nation.
</P>
<P>
   In his prize-winning biography of Truman, David McCullough notes
that although Secretary of State Dean Acheson and British Foreign
Minister Ernest Bevin had ``done most of the work'' in putting the
alliance together, ``it was Truman who provided the commitment,
unreservedly, as he had with the Marshall Plan.''
</P>
<P>
   McCullough explained: ``He (Truman) ranked NATO with the
Marshall Plan as one of the proudest achievements of his presidency
and was certain that time would prove him right.''
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what has happened. Time has proved him right.
</P>
<P>
   But he probably would have been as pleased with the humanitarian
aspect of the mission in Kosovo as with its military side.
</P>
<P>
   Since Truman has become a folk hero, few Americans realize that
he was held in low esteem during much of his presidency and that
his administration was besmirched by scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1951, eight months after he upheld civilian control
of the military by firing Gen. Douglas MacArthur from his command
in Korea, polls showed that only 23 percent of the American people
approved of Truman's handling of his job. Millions of Americans
thought him inadequate to the demands of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But then a magnificent old friend came to call and buoy his
spirits. It was 77-year-old Winston Churchill, who had just been
returned to office as prime minister in England and whom Truman
regarded as the greatest public figure of his age.
</P>
<P>
   Here is McCullough's description of the scene at the end of a
dinner aboard the presidential yacht Williamsburg when the eloquent
Churchill began to speak:
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at Truman, Churchill said slowly, `The last time you
and I sat across the conference table was at Potsdam, Mr.
President.' Truman nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ```I must confess, sir,' Churchill went on, `I held you in very
low regard then. I loathed your taking the place of Franklin
Roosevelt.' He paused. `I misjudged you badly. Since that time, you
more than any other man have saved Western civilization.'
</P>
<P>
   ``In a dark period for Harry Truman, a winter of tawdry scandal,
of interminable war in Korea and greatly diminished public
confidence in his leadership, the gallant old ally had again, as
only he could, served as a voice of affirmation.''
</P>
<P>
   The liberation of Kosovo is not an action commensurate with
those taken by Truman in more perilous times. But it is one in
which the magnificent achievement of an earlier generation and
president served well this generation and this president.

SLIDE RULES TAP INTO NOSTALGIA OF THE POCKET PROTECTOR CROWD 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)

 By IAN AUSTEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walter Shawlee admits that in the 1960s, he frequently paraded
around his Los Angeles high school with a slide rule _ ``the
techno-guys' version of a broadsword'' _ protruding from his shirt
pocket.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of the electronic calculator in the 1970s sent
slide rules tumbling from the must-have category of geek chic. Even
Shawlee reluctantly abandoned the slide rule _ including his first
one, which took six months of saving to purchase _ when he headed
to college to study computer science.
</P>
<P>
   Now 49 years old and head of a successful firm in Kelowna,
British Columbia, that specializes in designing electronics systems
for aircraft, Shawlee is using the latest technology to keep slide
rules on life support.
</P>
<P>
   Through his Web site, the Slide Rule Universe
www.sphere.bc.ca/test/sruniverse.html, Shawlee has become probably
the world's largest retailer of unused, if rather old, slide rules.
``There's yet to be a calculator made that's as easy to use as a
slide rule,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The site, which features thousands of slide rules for sale, is
no Amazon.com. Still, for the last 18 months it has generated
$3,000 to $6,000 a month selling slide rules. Along with pitches,
there is a vast range of slide rule information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter has done the best job in the world of putting all this
together,'' said Al Kalian, a slide rule collector in San Francisco
who has purchased about 25 of them from Shawlee.
</P>
<P>
   Shawlee's interest in the gadgets was revived two years ago when
he found the two rules he had used in high school while cleaning
out a desk. He was struck at how simple and elegant they were to
use compared with high-end electronic calculators. The Web site
followed, initially as an information service after he became
frustrated by the scarcity of information about slide rules.
</P>
<P>
   By reading e-mail to his site, Shawlee quickly discovered that
there was an unsated demand for slide rules. But since production
of general-purpose slide rules ended worldwide about 1972, as far
as he can tell, used rules seemed to be the only option for the
unsatisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Then Shawlee heard from Foo Cheow Ming, a government worker in
Singapore, about a year and a half ago. Foo had discovered at least
five wholesalers and retailers (including a street vendor) in
Singapore who were stuck with piles of never-used slide rules. In
the end, Shawlee imported 3,000 from Singapore and rounded up a
similar number of orphaned slide rules in North America and Europe,
often from school boards, to start his retail business. Its
offerings include a modest pocket-size rule selling for $16 and a
$295 slide rule made in Japan and designed to solve chemical
engineering problems.
</P>
<P>
   Shawlee's largest group of customers is made up of people
searching for slide rules like the ones they used at school. Slide
rules are also sought by parents who want to improve their
children's math skills. ``People who grow up with calculators have
no number sense,'' Shawlee said. He also sells slide rules to a
weather station in Antarctica, where many electronic gadgets can't
take the cold.
</P>
<P>
   If Shawlee is any example, however, the chances of a slide rule
resurrection are slim. While he uses them for some tasks, like
currency conversions, he still relies on a battery-powered
calculator for his electronics design work.

 &HT;    DYING AS REFUGEES: Sadly, some will never return home to Kosovo

   KUKES, Albania _ Peace did not come soon enough for Halil Emini.
</P>
<P>
   He did not get killed by Yugoslav forces or NATO bombs. He just
drowned last Friday while swimming with his children near their
refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   Now, instead of planning a return to his homeland along with
thousands of other refugees who began streaming back across the
Albanian border near here Wednesday, Emini lies under a mound of
dirt on a plateau with 140 other deceased ethnic Albanians who fled
Kosovo during the Serbs' ethnic cleansing campaign. In a new
section the local city cemetery, their graves show the signs of a
people dispossessed.
</P>
<P>
   Wooden stakes mark the identities of the dead. Their names,
birth dates and home villages are marked with a ballpoint pen and
usually, to protect them from the elements, covered by half of an
old plastic soft-drink bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Far from the hubbub of the crowded refugee camps, there is
cemetery silence here. The wind rustles through the trees, only
occasionally interrupted by crackling gunfire from a nearby Kosovo
Liberation Army training ground.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a few graves carry the wreaths and ribbons of slain
fighters in the rebel KLA. But most here died in mundane ways -- a
child hanged accidentally on a rope in a refugee camp, a
middle-aged man had a heart attack, many died of old age. A baby
died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, or SIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Aid officials say mortality rates are normal among the refugees,
maybe even lower for people in camps than those traveling roads and
doing work. Figures were not available, but as many as 500 have
died among Albania's 440,000 Kosovar refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees' long wait for NATO troops to move into Kosovo came
to an end last Saturday, as the vanguard of British forces began
streaming into Pristina, determined to ensure peace in the
provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
   The was no jubilation among the families of Emini and others for
whom the entry of NATO forces came too late, however.
</P>
<P>
   While death is a fact of life, for refugees it comes on a
foreign land, where they die in new-found poverty and far from
realizing their dreams of returning home.
</P>
<P>
   Just an hour after Emini's death, his widow huddled silently
with other women in one of the 200 tents at the seedy Bashkia
refugee camp. A bearded man, a relative, squatted on the hard red
dirt near the tent flaps and cried. A group of men stood nearby,
angry and sad and lamenting their plight.
</P>
<P>
   They described Emini as a 42-year-old dye supervisor in a
textile plant in the Kosovo provincial district of Opoja. He was
tall and thin.
</P>
<P>
   They said he was quieter and poorer than the other refugees. He
had traveled for about a week on a neighbor's tractor to flee
marauding Serb troops and paramilitary thugs and arrived here April
4.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when word came of the peace agreement between the
NATO alliance and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, Emini did
not celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said this is the moment to be very careful, that we cannot
trust anything until we touch the realities,'' said friend Nazim
Tahiri.
</P>
<P>
   There is little to do in the Bashkia camp, run by the Kukes
municipality. The tents lack the double-sheeting that can provide
insulation from the sweltering sun. So people leave for a half-hour
walk to the White Drin River, which flows from Kosovo. The
turquoise water is less peaceful than it looks.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago before Emini's death, a child found an old hand
grenade in the river and got his hand blown off. Last Friday,
swimming with his 12-year-old daughter, and eight- and six-year-old
sons, Emini apparently strayed past a steep drop off of the river
bed. He called for help, but no one could reach him in time.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, his brother-in-law was helping plan his pauper's
funeral, clearly frustrated as much as saddened.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was thinking we should go back as soon as it is safe,''
Ramadan Jafir, 40, said. ``That is our place. That is our land.''
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday morning, about 200 men from the camp were trudging
away from the Muslim funeral for Emini in the Kukes cemetery. They
wrote his name on a stake and jammed it in a large mound of dirt
over Emini's plain wooden casket, then slipped a two-liter soda
bottle over it and poured water on the grave, as is customary here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their place is in Kosovo so it is better they should be buried
there than here,'' said Taf Gjana(CQ), a Kukes Albanian who earns
about $60 a month digging graves. ``But, since they were pushed out
and died here, this land is theirs as much as ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Gjana said many Kosovar Albanians say they will someday return
to take their family members' bodies back to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But aid officials say that the destruction in Kosovo, a southern
province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic, may require
half the refugees here to wait months before returning.
</P>
<P>
   Just like the camps, which are becoming more developed and
entrenched, the graveyard is taking on signs of permanence. Gjana
said they must always have a few empty graves ready. A few actual
headstones are appearing.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only one has an epitaph, those words used to sum up a
life.
</P>
<P>
   Between the two cloth flowers on the smooth white cement stone
of 70-year-old Abedin Liman Telaku, it names his village as Banje
and says simply, ``Forced out by Serbs.''

   For most homeowners, choosing the color for interior walls,
ceilings and moldings is largely a matter of taste. The only
considerations are whether a color may look good or where a
particular hue might be used to create a desired effect.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is more complicated for homeowners who live in
historic houses if they want to maintain the period accuracy of
their homes. For them, it is important to know what colors were
available when and how they were used by decorators.
</P>
<P>
   A general knowledge of color history can also be helpful to
anyone interested in interior decoration, because it provides a
source of inspiration for contemporary design schemes.
</P>
<P>
   The first period in American architectural history is the
colonial period. During the early part of this period,
functionalism took precedence over decoration. American interiors
were dominated by the natural color of the building materials,
mostly wood and stone. Plaster, sometimes used on walls or
fireplaces, was not white, but had a beige or tan cast from the
sand in its makeup. Colored fabrics, in the form of braided rugs
and quilts, were used to break the monotony of the austere
interiors.
</P>
<P>
   In the early part of the 18th century, homeowners became more
affluent and sophisticated. They could afford to build larger homes
and decorate them with paints and fabrics imported from abroad,
particularly England. English influences introduced decorating
schemes with chromatic color, that is colors other than black or
white.
</P>
<P>
   Wood paneling was often painted with hues of gray, light blue or
green, and sometimes with red-brown. Wood trim and molding around
windows and doors was painted with colors that complemented the
drapes or upholstery. Stenciled designs were used to relieve stark
plaster walls. Wood floors that were not carpeted were painted, in
solid colors or in patterns.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal and Greek-Revival movement reflected the idea that
classical Greek temples exemplified perfection in design. Builders
and interior designers used figures and patterns derived from
classical Greek motifs. Interior wall colors, gray, green and blue,
were muted and restrained. Ceilings, trim and moldings were usually
white or off-white with gilt accents. Floors were not painted but
finished to show the natural grain of the wood, and they were often
covered entirely, or in part, with carpets woven in floral or
geometric designs. Drapes and upholstery provided strong decorative
accents with hues of red, blue and green used in stripes or figured
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   By the middle of the 19th century designers lost interest in
Greek classicism and they turned to other periods for inspiration.
This began with the Gothic Revival, then later slipped
imperceptibly into the Italianate, Queen Anne, Shingle and Colonial
Revival styles. All these are usually grouped under the umbrella
term, American Victorian style.
</P>
<P>
   These styles were marked by an interest in elaborate ornamental
detail taken, often loosely, from motifs found in medieval, Asian
and Renaissance architecture. Color and pattern became dark and
solemn, even gloomy when seen through the eyes of modern viewers.
Decorators in the two decades after the Civil War used deep olive,
mauve and brown to such an extent that historians sometimes refer
to this period as the ''brown decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Plain flat surfaces gave way to textured surfaces with raised
designs, usually in high relief. Walls were often covered with
embossed wall papers in deep colors with stripes and patterns.
Woodwork, molding and trim were natural, not painted, but were cut
from woods like oak or mahogany and stained to darken the natural
color.
</P>
<P>
   Not all interior styles were grounded in the Victorian idiom;
the craftsman movement, the Shakers and Frank Lloyd Wright also
influenced decoration. These sources generated an emphasis on form
without ostentatious ornament, and the use of natural materials _
wood, tile, and stone. Colors like tans, browns and beiges were
used to create a warm tonality in rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The modernist movement began in the 1930s. It was inspired by
artists like Mondrian and architects like Le Corbusier, but it was
also heavily influenced by the Bauhaus and the movement called De
Stijl. Interior designers looked for ways to introduce modern
materials, like glass, chrome and plastic, into the design
vocabulary. Typical design schemes used achromatic tones of white,
gray or black as the dominant hue, with pure primary colors for
accents.

<P>
   ST. JOHN'S, Antigua _ It's another boiling hot day on Antigua,
where tourists chug Carib beer and frolic on sand as soft and fine
as baby powder.
</P>
<P>
   This is a sleepy Caribbean island that boasts 365 beaches -- or
one for every day of the year -- the perfect lure for sun-starved
American tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Antigua's not as prosaic as it might seem.
</P>
<P>
   Antigua, only 9 miles wide and 12 miles long, has become the
latest beachhead in America's war to reshape offshore banking in an
economically troubled region increasingly reliant on this booming
industry.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials charge that recent laws passed here have weakened
controls on money laundering, making Antigua a haven for crooks
with money to hide.
</P>
<P>
   Antiguan officials have agreed to revise some measures, but
argue that most of their laws are first-rate, even when compared to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the crossfire of this war of words is a savvy
businessman from Houston named R. Allen Stanford, owner of the
island's largest offshore bank, Stanford International Bank Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States just doesn't want to see this island
succeed,'' maintained Stanford, who also heads the Houston-based
Stanford Financial Group, in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years, the offshore industry has become the
lifeblood of many Caribbean islands with scant resources beyond
tourism.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials say that lax regulation of the offshore
industry -- so named because its banks and other institutions
conduct no business in the country where they're registered -- has
aided money launderers from criminal organizations across the
globe.
</P>
<P>
   Antigua, in particular, has long battled an image as one of the
Caribbean's most corrupt, unpoliced islands.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last year, the twin-island nation of Antigua and
Barbuda, with a population of just under 64,000, was home to as
many as 57 offshore banks, mostly U.S.-owned.
</P>
<P>
   These banks started cropping up a few years ago, when Antigua's
offshore industry was virtually unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   The island made headlines in 1997 when it closed five
Russian-owned banks local officials said were suspected of
laundering hundreds of millions of dollars for the Russian mafia.
</P>
<P>
   Only a year earlier, Antigua had enacted an
anti-money-laundering law, one U.S. officials contend was never
fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in April, the U.S. Treasury Department took the drastic
step of publicly warning U.S. banks to keep close tabs on
transactions conducted through banks in Antigua because of their
susceptibility to money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the second time in history that the department has
targeted a specific country with such a warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that the Antiguan government has, in effect,
turned away from its partnership with the United States government
in combating money laundering and other financial crimes,'' wrote
James L. Johnson, undersecretary for enforcement in the U.S.
Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   The advisory was a surprise blow to Antiguan officials -- and to
others -- who point to a continuing effort here to clean up the
reputation of the offshore industry, an effort Stanford has played
a leading role in.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are islands with far worse records on money laundering
than Antigua, so we can't figure out why the United States is
picking on this one country, unless it has something against
Stanford,'' said Charles Intriago, publisher of the newsletter
Money Laundering Alert.
</P>
<P>
   Tall and friendly, with a Texas drawl to match, the 49-year-old
Stanford made his money in the early 1980s building houses in
Houston. One neighborhood there, Stanford Oaks, still bears his
name.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s Stanford set up his first bank in the Caribbean
-- where he had once taught scuba diving -- so that his homebuyers
might have a place to deposit their escrows.
</P>
<P>
   He opened his bank in Antigua in 1985. And today Stanford, who
flies in and out of this island in a private jet, is like this
island's own Henry Potter, the character from ``It's a Wonderful
Life'' -- only a kinder, gentler version -- in that he seems to
have his hands in almost every pie.
</P>
<P>
   Antiguans peruse his daily newspaper, the Antigua Sun, and
conduct business at his domestic bank, the Bank of Antigua.
</P>
<P>
   His offshore bank -- one of the first sights people see upon
exiting the airport -- is an imposing structure that dwarfs the
island's other commercial buildings in terms of its grandness.
</P>
<P>
   He's also spearheading construction of a hospital, a hotel and
office complex, and an indoor basketball stadium near the home of
Prime Minister Lester Bird, a good friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a johnny-come-lately,'' says Stanford, whose
businesses employs some 500 people here. ``I call myself Texan
first, and an Antiguan second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antigua's been my primary residence for seven continuous
years,'' he adds. ``I'm becoming an Antiguan citizen this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   While no one seems to question Stanford's love of the island --
Lionel Hurst, Antigua's ambassador to the United States, calls him
``as forthright and respectable as they come'' -- the breadth of
his business activities here does raise eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most important is that Stanford has helped Antigua
draft legislation to oversee its offshore industry by paying a team
of U.S. consultants to advise Antigua as it prepared amendments to
its anti-money-laundering law.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford said he wants to help Antigua build a respectable
offshore industry along the lines of the Bahamas, which has
tightened controls on money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those amendments -- approved in November -- were viewed
as positive even by U.S. officials, such as the one making it
illegal for offshore banks to accept cash deposits.
</P>
<P>
   But others helped get Antigua, a former British colony, into hot
water.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Treasury officials say the more ``egregious'' amendments
weakened controls on money laundering by inhibiting investigations
and strengthening bank secrecy rules.
</P>
<P>
   They were most alarmed, though, that at least three members of a
six-member board created to oversee the offshore industry
represented the very institutions they were supposed to regulate.
</P>
<P>
   One of those three members was Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Errol Cort, once one of Stanford's attorneys,
explained the reasoning behind the board's make-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that in such a small country, with limited experience,
it would be useful to have people on the board who do have a lot of
experience in the industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Antigua, which earns $5 million a year from
offshore banks, has since reconstituted the board and Stanford is
no longer on it. The island's annual budget is $155 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did raise eyebrows here when Mr. Stanford was chosen to sit
on the board,'' said Althea Crick, the board's executive director,
adding no further explanation.
</P>
<P>
   She defended Antigua's actions, in general, insisting the island
today has ``zero tolerance'' for money launderers.
</P>
<P>
   The Antiguan government has shut down 14 offshore banks
suspected of shady dealings since November -- it expects to close
perhaps 20 more -- and has drafted new amendments to the
anti-money-laundering law local officials insist will satisfy U.S.
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, privately, U.S. officials continue to express suspicion
over Antigua's efforts, saying the island has a poor track record
when it comes to keeping promises and cooperating with U.S.
investigators in cases of suspected money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   They also express suspicion when it comes to Stanford and his
influence on the Antiguan government even though no one will
pinpoint any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that suspicion may be related to last year's discovery
that alleged front men for the late Mexican drug baron Amado
Carrillo Fuentes had deposited $3 million in accounts at Stanford
International Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But Stanford willingly handed over that money in February to the
Drug Enforcement Administration, a move that marked the first time
a Caribbean offshore bank has voluntarily repatriated drug money to
a U.S. government agency.
</P>
<P>
   Antiguan officials say the United States must have had an
ulterior motive in issuing the April advisory, which they are
pushing to have lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States doesn't want us to do well because then it
would lose its influence over us,'' said Attorney General Cort.
``The U.S. government would like to keep us as beggars, down on our
knees, looking for U.S. aid.''

   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico _ In a tidy house in this
quiet Mexican city, children scamper in a courtyard while women sew
and bake -- and rehearse the hard-boiled plays they've written
about lives scarred by rape, poverty and child labor.
</P>
<P>
   It's a far cry from Broadway, but the Mayan Women's Strength
theater group is an experiment in drama all its own. The group also
provides childcare and community services for Mayan Indian women
here, and has toured the American Northeast, Texas, California,
Australia and Central America.
</P>
<P>
   FOMMA -- the Spanish acronym for the troupe -- remains a very
modest organization despite some measure of acclaim and its tours
abroad. Its primary goals remain providing bread-and-butter
services to abused and impoverished women and performing its plays
in the Mayan villages that encircle the city of San Cristobal de
las Casas in Mexico's Chiapas state.
</P>
<P>
   The women don't have to look far for inspiration for their
stories.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same area on the Guatemalan border where Zapatista
Indian rebels rose up in 1994, initiating a still unresolved
rebellion against centuries of injustice that Indians here have
suffered.
</P>
<P>
   The women of FOMMA, who choose to remain neutral in the
conflict, have their own war to wage, particularly against machismo
and inequality. With their plays, they often hold up a mirror to
their communities to reflect flaws from within.
</P>
<P>
   Founding members Petrona de la Cruz, 32, and Isabel Juarez
Espinosa, 40, were both put to work as children because their
families were so poor. Juarez was nine when her mother left her
with a non-Indian family in San Cristobal, where she was put in
charge of caring for the family's baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family wanted me to study, but they didn't even have
anything to buy a notebook,'' Juarez said. ``I also worked in
another family's home where all I got was leftovers to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Juarez married but her husband was killed in a dispute
over land, a precious commodity here that often leads to bloody
clashes.
</P>
<P>
   De la Cruz left her Mayan village at 12 to become a domestic
servant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to wash diapers at dawn and my hands would freeze,''
she remembers bitterly, sitting in FOMMA's small library for
children.
</P>
<P>
   She returned to her village, but had to work so hard at
gathering firewood, fetching water and cooking that she rarely had
time to get to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing for women was to learn to run the house,''
De la Cruz said. ``And if I didn't do my chores, I wouldn't get any
food.''
</P>
<P>
   At 17, De la Cruz was raped, an experience that led to her to
write her first play, ``A Desperate Woman,'' about a man who tries
to rape his stepdaughter.
</P>
<P>
   After the rape, she quit her community because her assailant was
never brought to justice and she found living there intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   Both women said they were finally able to fulfill dreams of
learning to read and write when they worked for sympathetic foreign
families in San Cristobal de las Casas who gave them time off to
study.
</P>
<P>
   Through the city's small-knit community of anthropologists and
social workers, the women gradually found their way into writing
and drama classes. Patient coaching brought their stories to the
stage and they learned to make props, costumes and shed their fear
of acting.
</P>
<P>
   They joined a drama troupe dominated by men, but split because
the men refused to perform ``A Desperate Women'' and told Juarez
she couldn't act because she was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of conflict being in the group with men,
especially when it came to expressing opinions,'' Juarez said.
</P>
<P>
   FOMMA was born in 1993 and De la Cruz and Juarez sought funding
from the state of Chiapas and from abroad, including from the
Global Fund for Women in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A group called Cultural Survival in Boston, Mass., helped fund
FOMMA's maiden journey to the United States several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Embassy initially balked at giving the women visas
because of fears the Mayan women would violate their visas and look
for work in America, according to Pia Maybury-Lewis of Cultural
Survival.
</P>
<P>
   An anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington
D.C. had to intervene to vouch for de la Cruz, Juarez and others,
Maybury-Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   At FOMMA's headquarters in San Cristobal, De la Cruz and Juarez
host a revolving group of Mayan women who have left villages
because they were abused or expelled due to religious or political
differences.
</P>
<P>
   The women take literacy classes in their Mayan dialects and
Spanish, and learn to sew, bake and to develop other job skills. De
la Cruz and Juarez said they learned from their own experiences
that childcare is a critical service as well, otherwise the women
wouldn't be able to study and work.
</P>
<P>
   And everyone, children too, help write plays and learn to act.
</P>
<P>
   A work called ``The Juanas' Life'' is a warning to women who
become domestic servants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about the kind of treatment you might expect, how to look
for jobs,'' De la Cruz said, ``and how to not just keep quiet when
you don't like something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Victims of Deceit'' explores family crises that develop when
Indian men leave villages to find work in the city, leaving their
wives behind.
</P>
<P>
   Other works combine Mayan mythology with feminist messages. When
they perform before audiences in the traditional Indian villages,
the group is often met with mixed reactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It surprises people when they see we can dress up and act like
men,'' said De la Cruz. ``There's still a lot that needs to be
changed for men to realize that women are equal.''

   ST. JOHN'S, Antigua _ It's another boiling hot day on Antigua,
where tourists chug Carib beer and frolic on sand as soft and fine
as baby powder.
</P>
<P>
   This is a sleepy Caribbean island that boasts 365 beaches -- or
one for every day of the year -- the perfect lure for sun-starved
American tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Antigua's not as prosaic as it might seem.
</P>
<P>
   Antigua, only 9 miles wide and 12 miles long, has become the
latest beachhead in America's war to reshape offshore banking in an
economically troubled region increasingly reliant on this booming
industry.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials charge that recent laws passed here have weakened
controls on money laundering, making Antigua a haven for crooks
with money to hide.
</P>
<P>
   Antiguan officials have agreed to revise some measures, but
argue that most of their laws are first-rate, even when compared to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the crossfire of this war of words is a savvy
businessman from Houston named R. Allen Stanford, owner of the
island's largest offshore bank, Stanford International Bank Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States just doesn't want to see this island
succeed,'' maintained Stanford, who also heads the Houston-based
Stanford Financial Group, in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years, the offshore industry has become the
lifeblood of many Caribbean islands with scant resources beyond
tourism.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials say that lax regulation of the offshore
industry -- so named because its banks and other institutions
conduct no business in the country where they're registered -- has
aided money launderers from criminal organizations across the
globe.
</P>
<P>
   Antigua, in particular, has long battled an image as one of the
Caribbean's most corrupt, unpoliced islands.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last year, the twin-island nation of Antigua and
Barbuda, with a population of just under 64,000, was home to as
many as 57 offshore banks, mostly U.S.-owned.
</P>
<P>
   These banks started cropping up a few years ago, when Antigua's
offshore industry was virtually unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   The island made headlines in 1997 when it closed five
Russian-owned banks local officials said were suspected of
laundering hundreds of millions of dollars for the Russian mafia.
</P>
<P>
   Only a year earlier, Antigua had enacted an
anti-money-laundering law, one U.S. officials contend was never
fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in April, the U.S. Treasury Department took the drastic
step of publicly warning U.S. banks to keep close tabs on
transactions conducted through banks in Antigua because of their
susceptibility to money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the second time in history that the department has
targeted a specific country with such a warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that the Antiguan government has, in effect,
turned away from its partnership with the United States government
in combating money laundering and other financial crimes,'' wrote
James L. Johnson, undersecretary for enforcement in the U.S.
Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   The advisory was a surprise blow to Antiguan officials -- and to
others -- who point to a continuing effort here to clean up the
reputation of the offshore industry, an effort Stanford has played
a leading role in.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are islands with far worse records on money laundering
than Antigua, so we can't figure out why the United States is
picking on this one country, unless it has something against
Stanford,'' said Charles Intriago, publisher of the newsletter
Money Laundering Alert.
</P>
<P>
   Tall and friendly, with a Texas drawl to match, the 49-year-old
Stanford made his money in the early 1980s building houses in
Houston. One neighborhood there, Stanford Oaks, still bears his
name.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s Stanford set up his first bank in the Caribbean
-- where he had once taught scuba diving -- so that his homebuyers
might have a place to deposit their escrows.
</P>
<P>
   He opened his bank in Antigua in 1985. And today Stanford, who
flies in and out of this island in a private jet, is like this
island's own Henry Potter, the character from ``It's a Wonderful
Life'' -- only a kinder, gentler version -- in that he seems to
have his hands in almost every pie.
</P>
<P>
   Antiguans peruse his daily newspaper, the Antigua Sun, and
conduct business at his domestic bank, the Bank of Antigua.
</P>
<P>
   His offshore bank -- one of the first sights people see upon
exiting the airport -- is an imposing structure that dwarfs the
island's other commercial buildings in terms of its grandness.
</P>
<P>
   He's also spearheading construction of a hospital, a hotel and
office complex, and an indoor basketball stadium near the home of
Prime Minister Lester Bird, a good friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a johnny-come-lately,'' says Stanford, whose
businesses employs some 500 people here. ``I call myself Texan
first, and an Antiguan second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antigua's been my primary residence for seven continuous
years,'' he adds. ``I'm becoming an Antiguan citizen this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   While no one seems to question Stanford's love of the island --
Lionel Hurst, Antigua's ambassador to the United States, calls him
``as forthright and respectable as they come'' -- the breadth of
his business activities here does raise eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most important is that Stanford has helped Antigua
draft legislation to oversee its offshore industry by paying a team
of U.S. consultants to advise Antigua as it prepared amendments to
its anti-money-laundering law.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford said he wants to help Antigua build a respectable
offshore industry along the lines of the Bahamas, which has
tightened controls on money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those amendments -- approved in November -- were viewed
as positive even by U.S. officials, such as the one making it
illegal for offshore banks to accept cash deposits.
</P>
<P>
   But others helped get Antigua, a former British colony, into hot
water.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Treasury officials say the more ``egregious'' amendments
weakened controls on money laundering by inhibiting investigations
and strengthening bank secrecy rules.
</P>
<P>
   They were most alarmed, though, that at least three members of a
six-member board created to oversee the offshore industry
represented the very institutions they were supposed to regulate.
</P>
<P>
   One of those three members was Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Errol Cort, once one of Stanford's attorneys,
explained the reasoning behind the board's make-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that in such a small country, with limited experience,
it would be useful to have people on the board who do have a lot of
experience in the industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Antigua, which earns $5 million a year from
offshore banks, has since reconstituted the board and Stanford is
no longer on it. The island's annual budget is $155 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did raise eyebrows here when Mr. Stanford was chosen to sit
on the board,'' said Althea Crick, the board's executive director,
adding no further explanation.
</P>
<P>
   She defended Antigua's actions, in general, insisting the island
today has ``zero tolerance'' for money launderers.
</P>
<P>
   The Antiguan government has shut down 14 offshore banks
suspected of shady dealings since November -- it expects to close
perhaps 20 more -- and has drafted new amendments to the
anti-money-laundering law local officials insist will satisfy U.S.
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, privately, U.S. officials continue to express suspicion
over Antigua's efforts, saying the island has a poor track record
when it comes to keeping promises and cooperating with U.S.
investigators in cases of suspected money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   They also express suspicion when it comes to Stanford and his
influence on the Antiguan government even though no one will
pinpoint any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that suspicion may be related to last year's discovery
that alleged front men for the late Mexican drug baron Amado
Carrillo Fuentes had deposited $3 million in accounts at Stanford
International Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But Stanford willingly handed over that money in February to the
Drug Enforcement Administration, a move that marked the first time
a Caribbean offshore bank has voluntarily repatriated drug money to
a U.S. government agency.
</P>
<P>
   Antiguan officials say the United States must have had an
ulterior motive in issuing the April advisory, which they are
pushing to have lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States doesn't want us to do well because then it
would lose its influence over us,'' said Attorney General Cort.
``The U.S. government would like to keep us as beggars, down on our
knees, looking for U.S. aid.''

   SAN PEDRO, Calif. _ The sun was out and summer break was
beckoning, but inside Girolann Accetta's classroom, her students
were crowded around their computer screens, captivated by the image
of a bug they had plucked from the Dodson Middle School garden a
week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Magnified thousands of times, the thumbnail-size harlequin bug
appeared huge, menacing and undeniably scientific. A student
standing amid the tables of glowing computer screens murmured that
this was the ``kind of science'' students usually only ``heard
about'' in school.
</P>
<P>
   With a few clicks of a mouse, Daniel Sandri, 14, in charge of
controlling the microscopic image, zoomed to the tip of the
insect's hairy leg, then its abdomen and face. These students were
inspecting a bug they had found and mailed away to be examined as
part of Bugscope, a new program offering classrooms free Web-based
access to a $600,000 environmental scanning electron microscope at
the Beckman Institute at the University of Illinois in
Urbana-Champaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bugscope (bugscope.beckman.uiuc.edu/bugscope99)is among several
programs offering elementary-school and high-school students
Internet and modem access to advanced scientific technology. Other
students beyond the Dodson Middle School classroom have used
similar programs to remotely operate a 24-inch optical telescope, a
radio telescope, a magnetic resonance imager and NASA-designed
robotic devices.
</P>
<P>
   Students using such resources have produced real data about
stars and Jupiter's atmosphere, created digital libraries about
chick embryology and insect anatomy, and provided hours of testing
for the Mars rover. Some are making educational CD-ROMs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has come along, much bigger than us, is the Internet,
which has changed everything about participation,'' said Louis
Friedman, co-founder of the Planetary Society, which sponsors one
of the granddaddies of remote learning activities, Red Rover.
</P>
<P>
   A Lego robot that can be controlled by Internet and computer,
Red Rover reaches about 400 classrooms that have paid $700 each to
take part (planetary.org). The latest project, Red Rover Goes to
Mars, will allow 40 selected students to control the Mars rover in
2002, while other projects will buy $200 Lego simulation programs
that mimic rover activities.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these projects, except Red Rover, are offered free on a
first-come, first-served basis, or at a modest cost to schools
because the projects' producers obtain grants from NASA and private
businesses. But there are hidden costs. There is no extra pay built
in for teachers to run the programs, so they often end up working
on their own time, and they often need training.
</P>
<P>
   Some classes must be held at night or on vacation breaks. And
schools need Internet or modem connections and up-to-date computers
to run some of the software.
</P>
<P>
   For all its potential, such remote-controlled technology is
something of a hothouse flower of educational technology. Each
project requires extraordinary coordination between educators and
scientists, and tremendous financial and intellectual generosity.
Fitting it into the school curriculum is the hardest part.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of such `gee whiz' learning scenarios needs support
for teachers in terms of their own understanding of the science,''
said Roy Pea, director of the Center for Technology in Learning at
SRI International in Menlo Park, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The educational impact of the programs is unknown, but some
educators believe that giving students a taste of real-life
science, complete with its scheduling headaches and detailed
coordination chores, is important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been interested in science, but it's having kids
learn things that are real, not just memorizing things out of the
books,'' said Jim Roller, a public high-school teacher who oversees
the Goldstone Apple Valley radio telescope at the Lewis Center for
Educational Research, about 65 miles east of Los Angeles
(www.avstc.org).
</P>
<P>
   Roller's radio telescope program, backed by a NASA grant and
other government and private financing, offers free to schools a
six-day training program at his site followed by six hours of
telescope access that may be used over a few months. Universities
pay $50 for the program. Today, 18 schools participate, but Roller
hopes to expand to 500.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Remote-access projects have positive effects on student
motivation and confidence and appeal to non-science students,
educators say. ``I think it's been a kind of demystifying process
for them,'' said Cassie Dunham, an outreach coordinator at
Washington University in St. Louis, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   She oversees the Field Integrated Design and Operation project _
FIDO _ a pilot project that selected a few dozen high-school
students from Los Angeles; Phoenix; Ithaca, N.Y., and St. Louis
(collectively called Lapis after the initials of their hometowns)
to test the next Mars rover (wundow.wustl.edu/rover).
</P>
<P>
   ``This project awaits further backing from the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory and the Planetary Society,'' Ms. Dunham said, but its
data will be available to students participating in the Red Rover
Goes to Mars project.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot program's chief costs are borne by the teachers, who
donate dozens of hours of their time.
</P>
<P>
   During vacations and after school, FIDO students remotely
control a test rover at a secret location in the California desert.
Steven Dworetzky, a robotics teacher at the Thomas Starr King
Middle School in Hollywood, said his students have become experts
in the computer language that commands the rover, sometimes
troubleshooting for scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A physics teacher, Joe Wise, who runs the W.M. Keck Math/Science
Institute at Crossroads School, a private secondary school in Santa
Monica, Calif., has his students working on remote optical and
radar telescopes (www.kmsi.org/astro/variable.html). The projects
broaden students' view of learning, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids see high school as jumping through hoops,'' Wise said,
``and so they want to know what they have to do in the quickest
time, the shortest route. This thing tends to create an ambiguous
route with more time.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep prices low to schools, the universities and research
laboratories that produce such projects chase down grants and
volunteers. The Telescopes in Education, or TIE, project
(tie.jpl.nasa.gov/tie/index.html) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
is one of the largest and oldest remote access programs.
</P>
<P>
   Offered free to elementary and secondary schools since 1993, it
has reached 240 schools. TIE's director and co-founder, Gilbert
Clark, has kept the program low-tech and free to schools through
hours of donated development work on the prototype technology,
NASA's annual $100,000 support and a 200-volunteer network.
</P>
<P>
   To expand the program, he plans to hit the grant trail again
soon, raising enough to buy other telescopes around the world, each
costing as much as $120,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bugscope is expected to grow from a few classes to two to four
classrooms a week, using high-school student volunteers and
charging schools about $50 to prepare the bug for examination and
provide two hours on the microscope.
</P>
<P>
   Bugscope producers designed the program to run on volunteer time
at minimal cost. An earlier effort at the Beckman Institute,
Chickscope, which involved having individual schools submit
fertilized eggs for periodic inspection under a magnetic resonance
imager, was phased out because of cost and personnel demands, said
Clint Potter, the program director. But despite such obstacles,
student enthusiasm keeps remote technology projects alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of funny,'' said Aaron Parker, 18, one of Wise's
students. ``One of the best parts is knowing that I have access to
a telescope that discovered the center of the Milky Way, and I can
spin it around if I want to.''

   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico _ In a tidy house in this
quiet Mexican city, children scamper in a courtyard while women sew
and bake -- and rehearse the hard-boiled plays they've written
about lives scarred by rape, poverty and child labor.
</P>
<P>
   It's a far cry from Broadway, but the Mayan Women's Strength
theater group is an experiment in drama all its own. The group also
provides childcare and community services for Mayan Indian women
here, and has toured the American Northeast, Texas, California,
Australia and Central America.
</P>
<P>
   FOMMA -- the Spanish acronym for the troupe -- remains a very
modest organization despite some measure of acclaim and its tours
abroad. Its primary goals remain providing bread-and-butter
services to abused and impoverished women and performing its plays
in the Mayan villages that encircle the city of San Cristobal de
las Casas in Mexico's Chiapas state.
</P>
<P>
   The women don't have to look far for inspiration for their
stories.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same area on the Guatemalan border where Zapatista
Indian rebels rose up in 1994, initiating a still unresolved
rebellion against centuries of injustice that Indians here have
suffered.
</P>
<P>
   The women of FOMMA, who choose to remain neutral in the
conflict, have their own war to wage, particularly against machismo
and inequality. With their plays, they often hold up a mirror to
their communities to reflect flaws from within.
</P>
<P>
   Founding members Petrona de la Cruz, 32, and Isabel Juarez
Espinosa, 40, were both put to work as children because their
families were so poor. Juarez was nine when her mother left her
with a non-Indian family in San Cristobal, where she was put in
charge of caring for the family's baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family wanted me to study, but they didn't even have
anything to buy a notebook,'' Juarez said. ``I also worked in
another family's home where all I got was leftovers to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Juarez married but her husband was killed in a dispute
over land, a precious commodity here that often leads to bloody
clashes.
</P>
<P>
   De la Cruz left her Mayan village at 12 to become a domestic
servant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to wash diapers at dawn and my hands would freeze,''
she remembers bitterly, sitting in FOMMA's small library for
children.
</P>
<P>
   She returned to her village, but had to work so hard at
gathering firewood, fetching water and cooking that she rarely had
time to get to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing for women was to learn to run the house,''
De la Cruz said. ``And if I didn't do my chores, I wouldn't get any
food.''
</P>
<P>
   At 17, De la Cruz was raped, an experience that led to her to
write her first play, ``A Desperate Woman,'' about a man who tries
to rape his stepdaughter.
</P>
<P>
   After the rape, she quit her community because her assailant was
never brought to justice and she found living there intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   Both women said they were finally able to fulfill dreams of
learning to read and write when they worked for sympathetic foreign
families in San Cristobal de las Casas who gave them time off to
study.
</P>
<P>
   Through the city's small-knit community of anthropologists and
social workers, the women gradually found their way into writing
and drama classes. Patient coaching brought their stories to the
stage and they learned to make props, costumes and shed their fear
of acting.
</P>
<P>
   They joined a drama troupe dominated by men, but split because
the men refused to perform ``A Desperate Women'' and told Juarez
she couldn't act because she was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of conflict being in the group with men,
especially when it came to expressing opinions,'' Juarez said.
</P>
<P>
   FOMMA was born in 1993 and De la Cruz and Juarez sought funding
from the state of Chiapas and from abroad, including from the
Global Fund for Women in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A group called Cultural Survival in Boston, Mass., helped fund
FOMMA's maiden journey to the United States several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Embassy initially balked at giving the women visas
because of fears the Mayan women would violate their visas and look
for work in America, according to Pia Maybury-Lewis of Cultural
Survival.
</P>
<P>
   An anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington
D.C. had to intervene to vouch for de la Cruz, Juarez and others,
Maybury-Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   At FOMMA's headquarters in San Cristobal, De la Cruz and Juarez
host a revolving group of Mayan women who have left villages
because they were abused or expelled due to religious or political
differences.
</P>
<P>
   The women take literacy classes in their Mayan dialects and
Spanish, and learn to sew, bake and to develop other job skills. De
la Cruz and Juarez said they learned from their own experiences
that childcare is a critical service as well, otherwise the women
wouldn't be able to study and work.
</P>
<P>
   And everyone, children too, help write plays and learn to act.
</P>
<P>
   A work called ``The Juanas' Life'' is a warning to women who
become domestic servants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about the kind of treatment you might expect, how to look
for jobs,'' De la Cruz said, ``and how to not just keep quiet when
you don't like something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Victims of Deceit'' explores family crises that develop when
Indian men leave villages to find work in the city, leaving their
wives behind.
</P>
<P>
   Other works combine Mayan mythology with feminist messages. When
they perform before audiences in the traditional Indian villages,
the group is often met with mixed reactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It surprises people when they see we can dress up and act like
men,'' said De la Cruz. ``There's still a lot that needs to be
changed for men to realize that women are equal.''

LOCKHEED MARTIN, BOEING EXCHANGE BARBS IN CAMPAIGN FOR JSF
CONTRACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAN PILLER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LE BOURGET, France _ Like two politicians, Lockheed Martin and
Boeing are trading jabs in their all-or-nothing campaign for the
military's 3,000-airplane Joint Strike Fighter contract. And the
gibes have added considerable entertainment at the industry's Paris
Air Show this week.
</P>
<P>
   Companies often don't like to discuss competitors _ but not in
this case. Boeing is crowing about being under cost, a sly
reference to Lockheed Martin's admission of a cost overrun this
year. Lockheed Martin, in turn, is whispering about why Boeing
needed to redesign the tail section of its JSF entry.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least they have a tail on it now,'' said Mickey Blackwell,
president of Lockheed Martin's aeronautics sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have people coming up to me all the time with these good
rumors about the Lockheed Martin program,'' Frank Statkus, Boeing's
JSF manager, said in an interview Tuesday after his company and
Lockheed held dueling news media briefings on their JSF programs.
``I tell them I don't have time for it. We have a competition to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   The barbs at the air show _ a major exposition for manufacturers
and potential buyers _ have underscored the enormous stakes
involved. The competing versions of the JSF won't fly until next
year and the Pentagon won't make its choice until 2001. But the
program is expected to be the last major U.S. military fighter
contract until 2040 and will be worth up to $40 billion in domestic
and foreign sales.
</P>
<P>
   If Lockheed Martin wins, it will do the work at its Fort Worth
plant to replace the current F-16 line. If it loses the contract,
the company has implied that the Fort Worth operation could be hit
hard.
</P>
<P>
   Although rumors have abounded from Washington that the federal
government will split the final contract to preserve two major
fighter contractors, both companies say they're proceeding as if
their lives are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one is a must-win,'' said Fort Worth plant President Dain
Hancock.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the reports from the rival camps have tended to
exaggerate the others' troubles. Lockheed Martin has taken pains to
refute rumors that its cost overrun has been as high as $300
million, although it won't specify the amount.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Lockheed Martin has noted that it has stuck with the
same design it submitted when it won its way into the final
competition in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Statkus said Boeing's JSF has had a tail from the beginning. It
just needed to be changed earlier this year to meet stability
requirements. No big deal, he said in the same tone that Blackwell
used when talking about Lockheed Martin's costs.
</P>
<P>
   And Lockheed Martin's JSF director, Frank Cappucio, said that
the cost overrun ``doesn't mean that we have run out of money. It
means that the testing on some of the risk factors was a little
more expensive than we had anticipated. We'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have begun assembling their two demonstrator
aircraft at plants in Palmdale, Calif. They will be tested at
nearby Edwards Air Force Base. There will be a fly-off beginning
next year and into 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The plane will be a multiservice aircraft, going to the U.S. Air
Force, Navy and Marines and to the British Royal Navy. Because the
U.S. Navy and Air Force already have their favorite fighters _ the
Navy's Boeing F-18 and the Air Force's Lockheed Martin F-22 _
suggestions have been made that one or both of those services will
bug out.
</P>
<P>
   That has happened before. The Navy was supposed to have been a
part of the F-111 and F-16, both Fort Worth products, but opted
out. If that happens again, the Marines will be left high and dry.
They desperately need replacements for their aging FA-8
vertical-lift fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be out of luck,'' said Marine Lt. Gen. Fred McCorkle,
deputy director of the Marine's aviation program. ``I keep telling
the Navy and the Air Force to stay with this. I think they will.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marine version will have vertical lift. To help out,
Lockheed Martin has engaged British Aerospace, builder of the
Harrier ``jump jet,'' as a partner in the JSF. Boeing, which merged
with AV-8 vertical-lift builder McDonnell Douglas two years ago, is
relying on a Harrier-like lift configuration that uses two
downward-pointing nozzles from the main engine.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin officials have suggested that Boeing's hot
exhaust vertical lift plan won't work because it would throw
intolerable heat back into the airplane as it hovers. But Statkus
said that isn't so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our version is no hotter than the Harrier, and the British
have been using it for 30 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin has touted its shaft-driven fan, which blows
cooler, nonjet air downward to propel the craft. Cappucio said,
``We believe in this concept. And the vertical lift will be the
determinant in who wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Statkus doesn't agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The winner will be the lowest-cost provider,'' he said, a
reference to Boeing, which claims to now be within budget while
Lockheed Martin has run over.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Boeing says that the Lockheed Martin vertical lift
might not be all that cool, anyway. Lockheed Martin's entry, unlike
Boeing's, has a swiveling rear exhaust that will point down when
hovering. That exhaust will be pure jet heat.
</P>
<P>
   British Aerospace has about 40 engineers working in Fort Worth.
Northrop Grumman, builder of Navy planes going back to World War
II, is another joint venture partner and has 20 engineers in Fort
Worth.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is obvious that the rivals have respect for one
another. Statkus said ``I tell my people every day that we can't
count on Lockheed Martin to lose this competition. We'll have to
win it.''
</P>
<P>

strike fighter, a big contract that Lockheed Martin and Boeing are
trying to win.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Sony Corp. put Aibo, its $2,500 robotic dog, up for sale on
its Web site in May, John Wharton was determined to get one. After
two hours of trying to get past the congestion on the site, he
finally placed his order.
</P>
<P>
   Wharton has no plans to give his mechanical-electronic dog away
as a gift, to keep it around the house as a virtual pet or to
preserve it as a collector's item. After a period of clinical
observation, Wharton intends to apply screwdriver and pliers,
taking it apart chip by chip, motor by motor, sensor by sensor.
</P>
<P>
   Wharton is a reverse engineer. For pure pleasure, he has
dissected VCRs, answering machines, floppy disk drives, cellular
phones, camcorders and laser printers. His most satisfying private
project of late is the painstaking dissection of Furby, the
electronics-laden toy, which Wharton views as a tour de force in
compact, highly intricate yet cost-efficient engineering. To date,
he has dismantled five of them, all to varying degrees, all with
different technical goals in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Wharton, 44, supports himself, and a handful of expensive and
eccentric hobbies, mostly by working as a highly paid forensic
engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Wharton is hired as a high-tech detective by law firms whose
corporate clients are involved in patent disputes. They call on
Wharton to take a finished product and trace it back through
thousands of steps to its original specifications to see where an
infringement may lie. In the last 10 years, he has been hired to
reverse-engineer video game players, home health devices and
several variations on PC circuitry.
</P>
<P>
   A bearded man with long graying hair, Wharton has maintained a
Zelig-like presence in Silicon Valley for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, as a 23-year-old engineer at Intel, he was the
architect of a computer chip called the 8051. Along with its
various offspring, the 8051 is the highest-volume microprocessor
the company has ever introduced. And in 1995, Wharton played a
small role in the capture of Kevin Mitnick, the computer hacker who
recently pleaded guilty to charges of computer fraud and wire
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Wharton quit his job at Intel and became a consultant,
in part because he was eagerly anticipating the debut of David
Letterman's show, which would be broadcast until 2 a.m. each night.
Having to get up in time to make the 8:10 a.m. sign-in at Intel
every day would deprive him of sufficient sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Wharton works from his house in Palo Alto, Calif., where he
lives with a cat named Zero. ``People ask me if I have a dog named
One,'' he said. (He does not.) His newest pet, Roo-Roo, a gray and
pink Furby with black spots, is the only Furby to have escaped the
pliers. ``He was my firstborn,'' Wharton explained, tenderly.
</P>
<P>
   Wharton's name is on the short list of engineers in Silicon
Valley whom law firms turn to when they need expert technical help.
He does not disguise his self-confidence. David Larson, a partner
at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &AMP; Rosati, a Palo Alto law firm that has
on occasion retained Wharton as its expert engineer, said that
behind his disheveled appearance was an extraordinary intelligence,
accompanied by ``the arrogance that comes with being so
knowledgeable about certain things.'' Wharton's fees _ up to $350
an hour _ occasionally rival those of the lawyers who hire him.
</P>
<P>
   But those who know Wharton's work say he is worth every cent.
``When John is trying to incorporate a new fact about something
he's reverse engineering, he can remember 10 other aspects of the
design that will be affected,'' said Brian Case, a fellow reverse
engineer who has worked with Wharton on several technical projects.
``He arrives at his solution faster. That's where his genius comes
in.''
</P>
<P>
   The concept of reverse engineering can be likened to being given
a slice of cake, Wharton said, then being told to unbake it and to
produce the recipe and a list of the raw ingredients in the
process. ``Baking a cake might take a lot of skill, but unbaking a
cake is a more interesting problem,'' Wharton said.
</P>
<P>
   In Wharton's view, reverse engineering is the ultimate puzzle.
The electronic age, he noted, has made the process of ascertaining
whether a patent has been encroached upon much more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that machines were physical,'' he said. ``You
could study the gears and levers of a cotton gin and pretty much
figure out how it worked. But nowadays the things that pass as
machines are virtual. Cams and levers and drive belts are replaced
by source-code statements and subroutines and disk files.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence the need for hired guns like Wharton, people who can
extract the bits and turn them back into a form that judges and
juries can understand.
</P>
<P>
   To understand reverse engineering, Wharton said, it helps to
understand how electronic products are designed in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The design process starts with a written specification stating
how the product works, the calculations and decisions it has to
make, and how it interacts with the user. Next, a hardware design
engineer determines the circuit elements needed to perform the
desired functions _ keyboards or sensors for input, displays or
actuators for output, and memory for the program and calculation
variables _ and develops schematic diagrams showing how these
devices connect to the microprocessor, the central brain.
</P>
<P>
   Then a software designer writes the source code, a program to
read the relevant inputs, perform the necessary calculations and
drive the corresponding outputs. Such a a control program, Wharton
said, may consist of anywhere from 2,000 to 20,000 individual
statements combined to form hundreds of individual subroutines, or
subprograms.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the source code consists of instructions in an
abbreviated English-like form that people can read and modify. But
before the program can be executed, it has to be translated into a
combination of bits (ones and zeros) understandable to the
microprocessor. That translation, performed by programs called
assemblers, leaves the program in a form incomprehensible to
humans. ``It's as though one were to flip 100,000 coins and try to
make sense of the pattern of heads and tails that result,'' Wharton
said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This information, many tens of thousands of bits, is loaded into
the microprocessor's memory when the system is manufactured and
causes the hardware circuitry to perform the functions and
calculations for which the product was designed.
</P>
<P>
   In reverse engineering a product, Wharton said, one goes through
the same steps in opposite order: The engineer removes the program
bits from the chip's memory, uses a disassembler to convert them
back into the program source code, analyzes that source code to
figure out what the functions were and what they did, and examines
the electronic circuitry to understand how various signals are
used. The engineer can then produce a lengthy written description
of the product's functions, which should be essentially the same as
the manufacturer's original specifications.
</P>
<P>
   With many of the patent projects Wharton works on, he said, he
seldom hears how a case turns out. Nor does he particularly care to
find out.
</P>
<P>
   For Wharton derives much of his satisfaction from the thrill of
the puzzle itself, like the inner workings of the Furby. Apart from
Dave Hampton, the inventor and engineer who created Furby and whom
Wharton reveres, Wharton may understand Furby's innards better than
anyone else. Although he and Hampton are acquainted, Wharton would
never think to ask Hampton for a road map.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be cheating,'' he said. ``It would be like asking
the guy who wrote the crossword puzzle for the answers.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Wharton's recent projects for hire involved dissecting a
home blood diagnostic instrument. In the middle of the assignment,
he took an unexpected trip to Sydney, Australia, so he hauled
everything with him, including a bag filled with soldering irons,
precision knives, voltmeters, jumper wires, pliers, clippers and
screwdrivers, and sat for several evenings in his hotel room in
Sydney, taking the system apart and studying its circuitry.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that's curious about this work is that it
requires time and isolation, being away from distraction,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   When not in the thick of a technical project, Wharton appears to
be easily distracted. A lover of movies, he is a regular at film
festivals, and he has invested in a small film. He had a bit part
in the recent movie ``Ed-TV.'' He has also witnessed each solar
eclipse visible from North America since 1991, flying off to
Mazatlan or Aruba at a moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   Wharton has also been known to apply his reverse engineering
skills to other parts of his life, with impressive results.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when the Letterman show came to San Francisco, Wharton
made a calculated effort to get noticed. He figured out which seats
the camera would be most likely to focus on and made sure that he
was seated there. He made himself conspicuous by undoing his
ponytail and letting his hair down and donning a tie-dyed shirt. He
ended up looking ``just like the sort of San Francisco hippie'' the
show's producers would expect to see, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. Letterman himself strode into the audience, asked
Wharton his name, then asked if he would agree to take a shower in
the host's dressing room _ an ongoing gag of Letterman's. Wharton
happily obliged. The cameras followed Wharton, from his torso up,
as he disrobed, stepped into the shower and lathered up. On his way
back into the audience, clad in a white bathrobe, he managed to
snatch a copy of the script.
</P>
<P>
   Those who knew Wharton well were not at all surprised by the
triumph. Wharton was later immortalized on Internet discussion
groups as ``the Shower Guy'' and was even paid union scale for his
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Wharton said, he was paid at the rate for a speaking
part because he said two words on the air. He said two words on the
air. In response to Letterman's question about his name, he said
``John,'' and when he was asked if he would take the shower, he
said, ``Sure.''
</P>
<P>
   In a similarly well-plotted effort in 1984, Wharton won a
Porsche in a product design contest after he figured out that the
sponsor, a chip manufacturer, would most likely reward the entry
that best suited its marketing efforts, not necessarily the best
design.
</P>
<P>
   Reverse engineering, Wharton said, is not unlike cryptography in
that it involves breaking codes. But cryptography no longer
interests him. ``There are now algorithms in place that cannot be
broken,'' he said. ``If you're looking for difficult problems, you
have to look elsewhere, and reverse engineering is the closest I've
found so far.''

<P>
   If there is a ``Phantom Menace'' of the Internet, it's MP3, the
compression software that enables CD-quality music to be sent on
line. Like the film, MP3 comes with a considerable amount of
hyperbole, promise and, alas, science fiction.
</P>
<P>
   The fiction is a consequence of the buzz. MP3 is said to be so
easy to use that many surfers assume that they can swiftly point,
click and download, say, the entire Smashing Pumpkins catalog. With
all the talk about MP3 as the future of music on line, more and
more people believe that MP3 is synonymous with online music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mass market has no clue what's behind MP3,'' said Mark
Hardie, a senior analyst at Forrester Research, which recently
issued a report on digital music distribution. ``The format is
meaningless to them. They just want the music.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as Kleenex is only one brand of tissue, MP3 is only one
form of online music. It is also technically tricky, legally sticky
and essentially a work in progress. In other words, if you're
having trouble getting started, don't worry _ it's not your fault.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 is one major step in the evolution of music on line, which
began more than a decade ago. The simplest way to describe it is as
a way of storing music in digital code. But it is by no means the
first way or the last.
</P>
<P>
   Among the first, at least in terms of music on line, were WAV
and .AU files. With the rise in the late 1980s of bulletin board
services _ electronic message systems formed around common
interests _ a subculture emerged of fans who swapped songs in one
of those formats.
</P>
<P>
   But because of these formats' limited compression technology and
the fact that early modems had bandwidth the size of a cocktail
straw, a three-minute song could take hours to download at the
common modem rate of 2,400 baud.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the Motion Picture Experts Group, or MPEG, of the
International Organization for Standardization in Geneva began
researching and developing a way to compress digital video _ in
other words, to reduce the amount of code, and thus the amount of
storage space, needed for a given image.
</P>
<P>
   The result, in 1992, was the MPEG format, which could also be
applied to audio files. It reduced storage space without
sacrificing CD-quality sound.
</P>
<P>
   MPEG-1 Layer 3, which would become known as MP3, was the most
powerful version, capable of squeezing a song into one-twelfth the
space that a WAV file would require. With the simultaneous increase
in bandwidth to 14,400 Kbps and then 28,800 Kbps, and even faster
speeds, the new compression technology meant that the same
three-minute song that took hours to send as a WAV file could now
be sent in minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Since MPEG was originally intended for digital video, it did not
immediately catch on for music. Instead, Web surfers flocked to
software like Real Networks' Real Player and Microsoft's Net Show,
which allow them to ``stream'' audio quickly (to download songs or
other sound in such a way that it can be played as it is being
downloaded).
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at the keyboard, a user could listen to live concert
Webcasts, radio and, yes, pirated recordings without lengthy
downloading. But the compromises in sound quality helped create a
demand for something that would provide CD-quality sound.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until the mid-90s that college students on high-speed
networks began rallying around MP3, which is considerably more
efficient at compressing the space needed for the digital code.
With MP3, a dozen albums can be squeezed onto a single CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   Like many popular music trends, the grass-roots movement around
MP3 soon caught the attention of entrepreneurs who were looking for
a new market. It also caught the attention of record industry
executives, who were rocked by the potential invasion of their
market.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com, a company based in San Diego, recently announced that
it would file an initial public offering that could raise up to
$115 million. Though the company's Web site (www.mp3.com) includes
more than 56,000 songs from 11,000 artists, it is not the official
source for MP3 _ there is no official source.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   MP3 songs exists everywhere. They can be found on
pay-to-purchase sites like Emusic.com (www.emusic.com), which
presents selections from a variety of independent record labels,
and on pirate sites run by individuals who illegally post digital
versions of copyright-protected music.
</P>
<P>
   Many search engines can find MP3 songs; 2look4 is devoted to MP3
searches, and Lycos has an MP3 search area. Olle Waltari, 18, a
student in Stockholm, created MP3Place (mp3place.net) to help
surfers find the files. But times have changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``MP3 might have lost a little of that `underground feeling'
that it had a year or two ago,'' he said via e-mail. He said he was
finding more legal MP3 sites and fewer illegal ones.
</P>
<P>
   Most major record labels have not made their artists' music
available on MP3. Sites that offer music illegally are easy to
find, but getting the songs is another story. Many record companies
are issuing cease-and-desist letters to the creators of such sites
or, often more effectively, threatening the ISPs that play host to
the sites, which in turn threaten to pull the plug.
</P>
<P>
   The copyright issue is already fueling a new wave of digital
compression wares. Despite the fuss, MP3 is a decade old _ eons in
the high-tech universe. Many companies, as a result, are quickly
developing and releasing compression alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Association of America (and the
Fraunhofer Institute, the Geneva organization behind MP3) has been
working to develop a Secure Digital Music Initiative, or SDMI,
standard, which would include a way to handle artists' royalties.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever standard SDMI comes up with will probably work with
various formats. The concern that is pushing the initiative to meet
a June 30 deadline is not so much the playing of MP3 files on
computers but a new generation of consumer devices in both portable
and home stereo versions that will play electronically delivered
music in one format or another.
</P>
<P>
   (The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday that one of
these devices, a portable player of MP3 files called the Rio, was
not illegal.)
</P>
<P>
   After meetings in Los Angeles, London and Tokyo, SDMI has agreed
to the release of devices this year that can play unprotected MP3
files, with the understanding that manufacturers will switch to
protected versions of all formats as soon as the SDMI
specifications are ready.
</P>
<P>
   A number of formats are available. Liquid Audio's Liquid Music
System encrypts music so that it cannot be illegally copied. And
Microsoft's MS Audio creates files half the size of MP3 and offers
a royalties system.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, one of the companies that worked with the Fraunhofer
Institute on MP3, has its own system, called A2B. VQF, a new
grass-roots program, is said to compress files three times as much
as MP3, with even better quality. Even MP3 has its own successor,
the higher-quality MP4.
</P>
<P>
   It is clearly still the Wild West for digital music on line, and
MP3 is an old but still formidable gunfighter. Forrester Research
predicts that SDMI will ultimately become accepted, whatever
formats are used.
</P>
<P>
   As for now, Hardie said: ``This is just techies arguing tooth
and nail about what's better. If you're still arguing over formats,
then you're not ready for consumers.''

 &HT;    Let Dad kick back in chairs that offer music, massage and
message of comfort
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Like modern dads, recliners today are more
sophisticated and sleek-looking than the stuffy, unsightly chairs
of the past.
</P>
<P>
   No longer banished to a corner in the basement or family room,
the new recliners glide, tilt, shake and swivel as well as recline.
Still other styles are big enough to seat two in cozy style.
</P>
<P>
   When Dave Rush, 36, and his family relax in their Marietta (Ga.)
home, they head straight for their two recliners. ``My 9-year-old
daughter Laken loves to sit on my lap when the `Sunday sleepies'
take over,'' said Rush, a principal with Kurt Salmon Associates.
</P>
<P>
   The recliner is not a ``lazy man's chair anymore,'' according to
interior decorator Alison Park of Paisley Park Interiors in
Alpharetta (Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   ``It has evolved into a versatile family chair done in beautiful
fabrics,'' said Park. ``For my clients, I put recliners in their
bedrooms as well as family rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the trend in recliners is toward smaller-scale chairs
that don't look like recliners and that don't take up as much space
as the room-eating monsters of a decade ago. These streamlined
styles offer such traditional chair features as wing backs, brass
studs and carved legs and feet.
</P>
<P>
   Other recliners are state-of-the-art chairs in which you can do
everything from ordering a pizza to indulging in a body massage.
For example, Lane's Ultimate recliner, the Voyager, starting at
$999, boasts a built-in speakerphone, a computer hookup, holders
for cups and magazines and a heated massage system. And La-Z-Boy's
newest recliner, the Oasis, which debuts in stores in August
starting at about $900, has its own refrigeration system for
stashing a six-pack.
</P>
<P>
   Also, hidden levers and buttons and streamlined mechanisms make
recliners appeal to a wide range of dads _ and kids.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent ``unofficial'' test of recliners at the HomeLife
store in Alpharetta, 8-year-old Haley Jackson of Marietta
pronounced Lane's Boulder chair, which is actually a
chair-and-a-half, ``comfy and looking good.'' Her dad, Bill
Jackson, 49, general manager of the Marietta Conference Center,
said it would ``be very easy to fall asleep in this recliner.''
</P>
<P>
   Testing Catnapper's leather-like recliner, complete with heated
massage, speakerphone and storage units, WSB-TV advertising
salesman Allen Williams, 46, and his 17-year-old daughter, Nicole,
both agreed _ ``it's great for Super Bowl watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Lots of people are willing to kick back and relax. According to
Furniture Today, an industry publication, sales of recliners
reached $3.3 billion in 1998. This figure was up an estimated 13
percent over the previous year's sales. La-Z-Boy is one of the
largest sellers of recliners. Other names in the business include:
Action Lane, Berkline, Barcalounger, Catnapper and Stratolounger.
</P>
<P>
   Recliners are in style for a number of reasons. ``I call it the
casualization of the American lifestyle,'' said marketing executive
John Chase of La-Z-Boy, whose company last year sold more than 1.5
million recliners. ``Nowadays people entertain less formally, often
sitting around watching large-screen TVs. They want to be able to
put their feet up and relax in the best seat in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   He also sees the recliner spanning the generation gap. ``Today's
kids see that Dad still has a recliner,'' said Chase, ``so they
think, `Hey, a recliner must be good, so I'll buy one too.'''
</P>
<P>
   Prices for recliners range from about $400 for a bare-bones
chair to more than $2,000 for a sleek leather job with all types of
electronic bells and whistles. Most recliners fall in the $500-$700
range.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing salesman David Brooks, 44, is more than willing to fork
over $700 for a recliner. ``After all,'' he says, ``you can't put a
price on pure comfort.''

FROM REBELLION TO OMANCE: A TROUBADOUR ENDURES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO _ To say that Francisco Buarque de Hollanda is
Brazilian music's best-kept secret would hardly be fair. After all,
a recent news magazine poll here named him the country's musician
of the century, ahead of Antonio Carlos Jobim, Milton Nascimento,
Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, the composer Heitor Villa Lobos and
even Carmen Miranda.
</P>
<P>
   But while the others have enjoyed international renown, the
career of Chico Buarque, as he is known, has largely been confined
to Brazil. In addition, he is most celebrated as a lyricist, with a
command of language so agile and clever that he has developed
parallel careers as a playwright and a novelist working in
Portuguese, which for all its liquid grace has little projection
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   After keeping a low profile while other performers of his
generation pursued success abroad, Buarque (pronounced
boo-AHR-key), 54, has re-emerged with a burst of activity. He
recently released his first CD of new songs in five years,
undertook a rare concert tour, created a Web site offering the
lyrics of more than 200 of his songs, and began work on a song book
intended to be the definitive distillation of his 35-year career.
</P>
<P>
   An adoring nation welcomed his return, assuring critical and
commercial success for his live performances and the CD, a soulful
collection of sambas and ballads called ``As Cidades'' (``The
Cities''). In a review of the album, Tom Ze, the eccentric
Brazilian composer who is an avant-garde favorite in the United
States, said, ``So much beauty is illegal, it's subversive, it's
Fidel Castro and Jesus Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining his return to the stage, Buarque said: ``When you
have a new record, the songs themselves are asking to be sung. The
shows exist as a function of those songs, but there's also an
audience out there that has known me for 30-plus years, knows the
lyrics to all the old songs by heart and likes to sing along. My
task is to find a way to please them so that I can have the
pleasure of singing the new songs for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Buarque came to prominence in the early years of the military
dictatorship that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985, and initially was
regarded as a protest singer with bossa nova roots. Several of his
most popular compositions were banned by military censors, and in
1969 he went into exile in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   After his return home, many of the songs he wrote, full of
untranslatable puns and double meanings, continued to address
social issues, and he remained a critic of the Brazilian government
and a man of the left. But as he matured he moved away from lyrics
that, as he put it, relied on ``artifices that seem
incomprehensible today.'' He turned into a writer of undulating
sambas and love songs brimming with romance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the handful of my songs most often cited as examples of
political resistance are sambas with a happy sound,'' he said.
``People may be protesting, but they are dancing while they do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Largely a self-taught musician, Buarque prefers to emphasize his
compositional skills and his sense of harmony. But Veloso, the
singer, describes him as ``a virtuoso of rhymes and verbal
rhythms,'' and others, like the film director Ruy Guerra, who is
making a movie based on one of Buarque's novels, are most struck by
his talent for wielding language. ``He writes songs, he writes
novels, he writes plays,'' Guerra said. ``From his very first
songs, you can see he was fascinated by language, and for a long
time people saw him only as a great lyricist. But today everyone
has to admit he is one of the biggest musical talents and poets
that Brazil has ever had, and that has enabled him to become one of
the country's strongest cultural references.''
</P>
<P>
   For years Buarque was the songwriting partner of Jobim, the
father of the bossa nova movement, who once described him as a
``troubadour, poet and singer who annoys tyrants and brings joy to
so many others.'' Buarque has a drawer full of tapes given to him
by Jobim, who died in 1994, and by the Argentine composer Astor
Piazzolla and others who wanted him to put words to their melodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid those tapes are going to stay where they are
because those partnerships were born of friendship and
conviviality, from the pleasure of delivering the song to a partner
who had challenged me by giving me a piece of music and saying,
`Let's see what you can do with it,''' Buarque said during an
interview in his study, which has a breathtaking view of the Rio
skyline and a shelf of dictionaries and encyclopedias. ``There was
very little professionalism in those songs we wrote and a lot of
camaraderie.''
</P>
<P>
   If Buarque is less prominent outside Brazil, that is largely by
choice. His aversion to touring is well known. With the substantial
royalties he earns from the hundreds of versions of his songs that
have been recorded by other Brazilian artists, he has little
financial need to work abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I haven't had invitations to perform in the
United States,'' he said. ``But for you really to have a following
there, you need to truly dedicate yourself to the effort. You need
to go there frequently.'' He added, ``I don't have the time or the
ambition for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in Brazil, Buarque avoids the stage. From 1975 to 1988 he
did not perform in concert, and the current tour based on his
latest album is only his second this decade. The shows are drawing
a predominantly middle-aged audience that continues to see Buarque
as Brazil's answer to Bob Dylan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chico is one of the biggest artists of all time, a classic
unto himself, but he doesn't like to play live, which makes him the
exact opposite of me,'' said Gil, the pop star whose most recent
American release, ``Quanta Live,'' won a Grammy Award this year.
``He doesn't make an effort to cultivate a magical, electrifying
presence onstage. Every five years or so, he does a tour, and
that's basically it. He'd rather write a book than play to an
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Buargue has written two novels, ``Estorvo'' and ``Benjamim,''
hermetic portraits of social misfits that became best sellers here.
``People bought it as if it were a record,'' Buarque said of the
first book, which was published in the United States as
``Turbulence'' (Pantheon, 1993).
</P>
<P>
   ``When I am writing a book, my guitar is always at hand, but I
don't have the slightest interest in music,'' he said. ``The same
idea, the first embryo, can serve just as well for a 200-page novel
as for a song with 15 couplets, but I think of my literature as
another universe. If I'm working on a record, then any idea I have
goes right into a song, even if it would be a good idea for a novel
or story.''
</P>
<P>
   Buarque has written four acclaimed plays, including ``Gota
d'Agua,'' a retelling of the Medea legend in a suburban Rio
setting, and ``Opera do Malandro,'' an adaptation of Bertolt
Brecht's ``Threepenny Opera'' with a very Brazilian libretto and
score. But most of his admirers hope that he will be less
promiscuous with his talent and devote time to his initial calling,
which these days he ruefully describes as ``a youngster's trade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chico is today the most complete artist in Brazilian popular
music, a genius of a lyricist, a marvelous melodist and a singer
with a very personal voice and timbre,'' said Almir Chediak, editor
of the ``Chico Buarque Song Book,'' which is to be published here
this year. ``He is modern in the very best sense of the word, but
his music is eternal. So long as there is a Brazil, people are
going to be singing the songs of Chico Buarque.''

AGREEMENT PERMITS PUBLICATION OF A PREQUEL TO `LOLITA' IN U.S. AND
BRITAIN   
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Italy, Great Britain)   By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a case closely followed by publishers because of its
implications for copyright law, a retelling of Vladimir Nabokov's
``Lolita'' from the nymphet's point of view, whose publication was
abruptly canceled last fall, will go forward as a result of an
unusual agreement worked out over the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux announced in November that it had
canceled plans to publish ``Lo's Diary'' by the Italian short-story
writer Pia Pera after the Nabokov estate filed a lawsuit stating
that the book represented a copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new publisher, Foxrock Inc., and Nabokov's son, Dmitri,
have reached an agreement that will allow the book to be published
in October in the United States, with additional commentary by
Dmitri Nabokov and Ms. Pera and a 5 percent payment of royalties to
him. The book, Ms. Pera's first novel, has been published in Italy
and several other European countries.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement allows Ms. Pera to publish her book in the United
States and Britain. It allows Nabokov to protect his copyright
interests in his father's book, which has sold 50 million copies in
at least 20 languages. But because no legal ruling was involved,
the deal leaves unsettled the major issue raised in the dispute:
How far can authors go in making use of characters or scenes
created by others?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Solomon-like agreement,'' said Martin Garbus, the
lawyer who represented Foxrock and its publisher, Barney Rosset.
``In a way, she wins, because the book comes out. He wins, to some
extent, copyright protection, protecting `Lolita' from future
ripoffs. It's a unique case that would have been a case of first
impression at the United States Supreme Court, and part of me is
sorry we didn't litigate it because it involves important
principles of law that affect other writers as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Authors have long borrowed from earlier works in the way that
the Greek legend of Pygmalion became a George Bernard Shaw play and
then the show ``My Fair Lady.'' Such borrowing is accomplished most
easily when a copyright has expired or never existed. ``Lolita''
was originally published in the United States in 1955 and is under
copyright here until the year 2050.
</P>
<P>
   Courts have established that parodies and critical essays are
protected uses of existing texts. A book that is clearly a sequel
or a prequel to an existing book under copyright protection, on the
other hand, would need permission to go forward. Less clear is a
case like this one, in which Ms. Pera took Nabokov's work and
reimagined it, telling the same story from the girl's point of
view. At issue is whether a book is considered ``derivative,''
essentially piggybacking on an existing text, or
``transformative,'' taking something existing and turning it into
an independent work with a new purpose, sensibility or mode of
expression.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, each side will receive 5 percent of the
royalties from the English-language version of the book to be
published by Foxrock, which obtained the rights from Farrar, Straus
&AMP; Giroux. Nabokov says he plans to donate his share of the
royalties to the writer's group PEN to help finance a literary
prize.
</P>
<P>
   Nabokov and Ms. Pera will both write prefaces to the book. Under
the terms of the agreement, however, he may read her piece but she
may not read his. Garbus plans to write an essay on the legal and
free-speech issues involved.
</P>
<P>
   Rosset, the longtime publisher of Grove Press, said the
settlement was welcome because it protected both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to protect both authors' rights,'' he said. ``We
could have continued the lawsuit, which would have cost a lot of
money and a lot of time and in the end everyone would lose. Instead
we tried to figure out a new approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter L. Skolnik, Nabokov's lawyer, said he was confident that
he would have prevailed if the legal issues had been tested in
court but that the agreement provided the copyright protection
Nabokov was seeking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nabokov was never interested in suppressing Pera's book,''
Skolnik said. ``Nor, for that matter, was he interested in the
money. The issue was always simply protecting the copyright. We
believe that Pera's book is absolutely based on Nabokov's in such a
way that a license from Nabokov had to be obtained. Our concern all
along has been that if this is permitted without obtaining
permission it could be disastrous for all publishers. Every time a
successful book is published someone could say, `Let's do it again
and tell it from another character's point of view.'''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is extremely complicated for publishers because their
interests can cut both ways. On the one hand, they and their
authors want protection for works they have already created. On the
other, they benefit from as much artistic freedom as possible and
the widest latitude for creating new works.
</P>
<P>
   Garbus said the agreement in the case was instructive as a
possible solution to similar disputes in the future. But since it
was an agreement between two parties rather than a court decision,
he said, it has no value as a legal precedent in future disputes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would prefer to see the law resolved,'' he said. ``I think
at some point the law has to be clarified, so there's some guidance
the next time someone writes something like this.''

   NEW YORK _ The colors are warmest in winter, when the sun's rays
are low in the sky and envelop the stained-glass horizon in amber
light.
</P>
<P>
   ``This window is certainly alive,'' the Rev. Gerald Johnson was
saying the other day, sitting in the pews of the Sage Memorial
First Presbyterian Church in Far Rockaway, Queens, and
contemplating the unsung Louis Comfort Tiffany masterpiece with
great gnarled branches that lies at the end of the A train.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives life,'' added Leonardo Thompson, a car-parts salesman
and longtime parishioner. ``Not only to the church, but to the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis Comfort Tiffany, who is buried not far away beneath a
smooth gray granite stone in Brooklyn's historic Green-Wood
Cemetery, designed stained glass windows like this ``Tree of
Life,'' his largest landscape, to be sacred. They still are _ not
only in urban reaches like Far Rockaway, where even thunderous jets
from nearby Kennedy International Airport can't disturb silent
prayers, but also in quiet corners of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany's special effects, pre-Spielberg, still illuminate
churches on Mare Island, Calif., and in New Rochelle, N.Y., and
mausoleums in Steelton, Pa.; St. Louis, and Adrian, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   They were built at the height of turn-of-the-century religious
fervor, when church-building was a national pastime and extravagant
tombs were embellished with art. But in a relatively obscure
private Jewish burial ground called Salem Fields, in Brooklyn, the
sacred has tangled with the profane and the profane has won.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Alastair Duncan, a leading Tiffany expert and scholar
whom colleagues say knew more about the location and authenticity
of Tiffany windows than anybody else, was indicted in U.S. District
Court in Manhattan on charges arising from the theft (or planned
theft) of Tiffany windows and the sale of one from Salem Fields, a
landscape in the ``River of Life'' series, to a Japanese client for
$219,980. If convicted on all counts, Duncan could get 35 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Even before news of this recent theft, paranoia had come to rest
among the tombs of the elite in cemeteries nationwide, where an
unknown number of Tiffany windows still reside. At one Brooklyn
cemetery last week, where windows remain deliberately unpublicized,
wind in the beech trees sent dappled light flickering ethereally
behind Tiffany clouds. And at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, Greek
Revival mausoleums built to express lofty values are now fortified
with bulletproof glass to protect the Tiffanys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it,'' said Woodlawn president and chief executive
Edward Laux, ``when Tiffany originally designed these
installations, he didn't think about them being stolen.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, which investigated the theft with the New York Police
Department, keeps no national statistics on Tiffanys-at-large. The
Art Loss Register database knows of nine missing Tiffany windows,
including five from cemeteries. More than 30 other period windows
from public spaces remain unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1980 book, ``Tiffany Windows,'' now itself a collectors'
item, Duncan wrote that stained glass windows were Louis Comfort
Tiffany's ``first artistic love.'' The lamps, he noted, were mere
afterthoughts, ingenious ways to re-use waste glass from the
windows that were his passion.
</P>
<P>
   The market for trophy Tiffanys, which resulted in a window
fetching $662,500 at Christie's last week, was feverish even when
the book came out, nearly 20 years ago. If a lamp could fetch
$250,000, Duncan mused in the book (which contains Tiffany's own
partial list of windows and locations), ``what will the major
windows themselves finally be worth?''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan has pleaded not guilty to the charges. He is out on bail
and is scheduled to appear in court next week, when a trial date is
expected to be set. He has long been considered ``one of the icons
of the Tiffany industry'' said Paul Crist, a Santa Fe Springs,
Calif., dealer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Wild West market,'' Crist added about the growing
demand on dealers, ``so dealers are tempted to skirt the gray
areas. There are so many collectors and so little merchandise.
Competition for a high-quality Tiffany window becomes like dogs
fighting over a bone.''
</P>
<P>
   (Last week, Duncan wrote to friends and colleagues to deny what
he called ``this baseless allegation'' saying, ``It will be
determined that I was a victim in this matter and not knowingly
involved in any wrongdoing.'')
</P>
<P>
   The stolen Tiffany landscape may have been a bargain for the
client. ``The price was very reasonable for a beautiful Tiffany
window,'' said Paul Nassau, the owner of the Lillian Nassau
gallery, noting that a ``terrific one'' can fetch $1 million or
more.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always so: the Tiffany style was considered passe by
1940 and went unnoticed until the 1970s. ``During World War II,
they would take the lamps and smash them on the sidewalk to sell
the lead,'' Nassau said. It didn't change until the '70s, when
celebrities like Barbra Streisand and Catherine Deneuve began
collecting.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the moody evocations of cypresses, wisteria and rivers
flowing into distant hills set collectors' hearts atwitter far more
than religious subjects. ``It's very difficult to sell the New
Testament,'' said Barbara Deisroth, a senior vice president of
Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Nassau put it, ``Nobody is risking their career over a
religious Tiffany window.''
</P>
<P>
   The theft has highlighted the rich legacy of Tiffany windows in
obscure places, including signature ``River of Life'' windows,
dreamy landscapes that flowed through gilded age churches, robber
barons' mansions and tombs. In 1976, a dazzling ``River of Life''
window, with pink irises in the foreground and sinuous cypresses in
the distance, was stolen from the Denkmann mausoleum at
Chippiannock Cemetery in Rock Island, Ill., tomb of a founder of
the Weyerhaeuser timber company. But the search by Rock Island
police, and the FBI (which recruited Duncan as a consultant), went
dormant.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Two decades later, Gregory Vogele, the cemetery superintendent
like his father and grandfather before him, spotted an article in
an Illinois newspaper about the Charles Hosmer Morse Museum of
American Art in Winter Park, Fla., which has one of the world's
finest collections of Tiffany glass. He sent them a photograph of
the missing window. ``Being third generation, there's kind of a
family history there,'' Vogele said of his attachment to the
cemetery. ``I had the good fortune of growing up looking at that
window in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Fatefully, several months after getting his letter, the museum
was offered the window, which had suffered an 18-inch diagonal
crack, by a private dealer and collector from Queens, the last in a
22-year trail of owners. It was surrendered to the FBI and recently
shipped back, heavily guarded, to the Denkmann family, which has
decided to restore the window and donate it to the nearby Davenport
Museum of Art, in Davenport, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was amazed,'' Fay Hauberg Page, a Denkmann
descendant, said of the window's recovery. ``Given the current
state of affairs, we decided it was safer in a museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Another stolen Tiffany window from the same cemetery remains at
large.
</P>
<P>
   Because ``no two Tiffany windows are exactly alike,'' said David
P. Donaldson, a former curator at the Morse Museum and now a dealer
in Orlando, a Polaroid may be the best defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The glass is all mottling and striations,'' Donaldson said.
``It's like a DNA print.''
</P>
<P>
   That quality of aliveness, in which a window's aspect shifts
constantly, like a trout stream or a flame, is one reason why
Tiffany windows across the country are being reclaimed and
appreciated anew. ``People today are looking for community,'' said
Virginia C. Raguin, an art historian at the College of the Holy
Cross in Worcester, Mass., who specializes in stained glass. ``They
are also rediscovering ritual. Those contemporary desires find an
echo in Tiffany windows, which create a tremendous sense of
place.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ann Arbor, Mich., a 10-by-6-foot Tiffany window in a 1904
former Unitarian church was rediscovered when an architectural
firm, Hobbs &AMP; Black Associates, moved its offices into the church
and peeled away some plaster. ``Voila,'' said Larry Frank, an
architect with the firm. ``There was the Tiffany.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, the full grandeur of a rare, intact Tiffany interior
was unveiled two years ago at the Ayer family mansion (built
between 1899 and 1901), a major Tiffany commission. The building,
now the Bayridge Residence and Cultural Center, a residence hall
for college women, is filled with exquisite Tiffany windows,
skylights and Byzantine and Moorish mosaics.
</P>
<P>
   And at the 1895 St. Gabriel's Roman Catholic Church in New
Rochelle, N.Y., a drive to restore four Tiffany windows has been
undertaken by a largely immigrant congregation. It is a warm,
jubilant place, despite missing pieces of glass and buckling lead,
with masses in English, Spanish and French.
</P>
<P>
   So far about $150,000 has been raised by parishioners, many of
whom hold down several jobs as seasonal laborers, gardeners, house
painters, nannies and country club workers.
</P>
<P>
   The church's population swells in the summer months and then
declines in winter, ``when there are no golf courses to take care
of or grass to cut,'' said Yolanda Davis, 60, a parishioner, who
was born in Guadalajara, Mexico. Her favorite spot is the pew next
to `` `The Visitation' _ the Tiffany,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at that window,'' she explained, ``it makes you
feel the presence of God is there.''
</P>
<P>
   The church wants to raise $300,000 to restore both the windows
and the building itself. ``People see themselves in these
windows,'' the Rev. Patrick Vincent McNamara said. The wedding of
Mary and Joseph, he said, ``looks so human, like the ordinary
marriage of two people in love.''
</P>
<P>
   In Far Rockaway not long ago, the parish got a call from an
antiques dealer offering to buy their window and replace it with a
copy. Even Johnson, the interim pastor, once suggested that the
financially strapped congregation consider selling. ``They didn't
even take me seriously,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be here forever,'' said the parishioner
Thompson. ``The other generation passed it down to us, and we want
to pass that same feeling on to them. It's our duty. Money's not
everything.''

A BAPTIST WOMAN SKIRTS THE EDGE OF CONTROVERSY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CARY McMULLEN   
 The Ledger (Lakeland, Fla.)   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Last year, when the Southern Baptist Convention voted
to add a chapter to the Baptist Faith and Message that declared ``a
wife is to submit herself graciously to the servant leadership of
her husband,'' Dellanna O'Brien braced herself.
</P>
<P>
   The executive director of the Women's Missionary Union figured
she would be besieged by the media, wanting her reaction as a
female official of the nation's largest Protestant denomination.
But to her surprise, no one came calling.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for her belated reaction, O'Brien declines. ``I'd rather
not. We have women of every kind of opinion, from
ultra-conservative to moderate. We can argue all day long, a lot of
times saying the same things in different words. I'd rather find
the real sticking points, the ones I'd die for,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In refusing to be drawn into controversy, she shows the
graciousness and diplomatic skills for which she is famous. But she
tips her hand a bit in her views about the place of women when she
describes her work and that of her husband, Bill, a Southern
Baptist pastor and missionary and former vice president of the
International Mission Board. It's a view that skirts the edge of
disagreement with recent Southern Baptist Convention philosophy,
which tends to stratify gender roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were both partners in having a ministry,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, 65, delivered her final report as executive director
Wednesday, during the last day of the Southern Baptist Convention's
two-day meeting at the Georgia Dome. She will retire later this
month and was honored by the convention Tuesday with a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Birmingham, Ala., the Women's Missionary Union has
about 1 million members. It was founded in 1888 as a means for
women to organize their work in local churches.
</P>
<P>
   By virtue of her accomplishments and her education _ she has
earned a doctorate in education from Virginia Tech _ O'Brien
represents the changes that have occurred in the lives of women in
her lifetime. She says her organization had to adapt.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early time, women were home-centered. There were few
ways they could be involved. Increasingly, women were more educated
and in the workplace. Our greatest challenge was that we were
beginning to see such changes with women in every facet of life,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, O'Brien has managed to have it all. A wife and a
mother, she served alongside her husband as a missionary in
Indonesia. Upon her return to the United States, she taught at The
Collegiate School, a prestigious private school in Richmond, Va.,
but became concerned for the children of missionaries who were
having trouble with school. The doctorate qualified her as a
diagnostician and she formed her own company, International Family
and Educational Services, to work with children and parents.
</P>
<P>
   When she was recruited for the position of executive director of
the women's group, she relied on divine guidance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't looking for this job, but there was a growing
awareness that God was ordaining this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   During her tenure, she has overseen new programs designed to
help working women find ways to serve others, the same impulse that
drove their mothers and grandmothers only in new ways. For example,
the group this summer will produce seven ``women-built'' Habitat
for Humanity homes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the other programs she has initiated reflect current
concerns that affect women, such as a Christian Women's Job Corps,
designed to ease the transition of women on welfare into the
workplace by pairing them with mentors for up to two years.
</P>
<P>
   She has also established a foundation to ensure that the
organization will have financial resources to carry out its
mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may be her greatest accomplishment,'' said Wanda Lee,
president of the Women's Missionary Union executive board. ``She is
one of the most brilliant thinkers I've ever been around. Every
time we room together on our travels, she is telling me about what
she has read.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien's obvious abilities experienced a setback in September
when she suffered a stroke. She continues to walk stiffly and
offers her left hand when she introduces herself. But Lee, a nurse,
says she showed determination to recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people close up after a stroke. She has not stopped
for one minute to think about herself. There was never any
whining,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With her retirement O'Brien and her husband plan to work side by
side again in missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to Germany in the fall and Australia in January.
We have an assignment to Argentina in the spring,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a warm pink dress that looked both professional and
feminine, she said women have the ability to use their heads as
well as their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid to bring different opinions to women because
they're competent before God. The main goal, though, is to get them
involved in Christian service,'' she said.

   &UR; NATIONAL FORECAST &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The first soaking rain in nearly a month will bring relief from
the dry spell to the Middle Atlantic region. Low pressure south of
Richmond will draw warm, humid air from the Atlantic inland and
over the top of a shallow, chilly air mass in the Northeast. There
will likely be two bands of moderate to heavy rain, one in the
Appalachians and the other right on the shoreline. In between,
periods of light rain and drizzle are expected. It will be very
cool with readings at least 15 degrees below seasonal levels from
Virginia to central New York. High pressure in Maine will keep much
of New England dry, but it will turn dull as clouds lower and
thicken.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms will be potent along the Southeast Coast as a cold
front pushes toward the Atlantic. A cluster of heavy thundershowers
may drench northwest Florida as tropical moisture merges with an
approaching cold front.
</P>
<P>
   More record chill is expected Thursday morning in the Middle
West as high pressure dominates the center of the nation. Less
humid and somewhat cooler air will circulate into the middle
Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and showers will persist near the eastern Rockies as
humid winds from the south ascend the sloping terrain. Patches of
moisture will circulate westward into the Four Corners region
leading to a few afternoon storms.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the West will be dry and warmer. Sunshine will be ample
from the interior Northwest into California and the deserts of the
Southwest. The Coast will still notice low clouds and fog.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Focus: Hot and Cold &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Very often, when the East gets cold, the West will get very
warm. Wednesday morning, Buffalo and Rochester both dropped to
record lows of 41 degrees, while on Tuesday afternoon, Lewiston,
Idaho set a record high of 99 degrees. The typical distance between
warm ridges and cold troughs in the jet stream is about 2,500
miles, or roughly the width of the United States. Thus, when a
bulge of warm air is over the West, a pool of cold air is often
over the East. A similar situation will occur Thursday, as parts of
the East may have highs only in the 50s in a steady rain, while the
West will again be near 90. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Extended Forecast &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Sunday _ High pressure just off the East Coast will
keep most of the Northeast dry and warm. A disturbance in the
Mississippi Valley will spread showers and thunder to portions of
the Southeast. A few afternoon thunderstorms may erupt in Texas,
otherwise, much of the Southwest will remain sunny and dry. A cold
front moving through the Rockies will bring showers and cooler
temperatures to the Pacific Northwest.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Tuesday _ A surge of warmer and more humid air ahead of
a cold front in the Great Lakes will trigger a few thunderstorms in
the Ohio Valley. Winds from the south around high pressure off the
Southeast coast will pump sultry air into the South. A few
afternoon rumbles of thunder may be heard along the Gulf Coast and
in the interior West. Dry and hot weather will continue in the
Southwest while cool air plunges into the northern Rockies.

 &HT;    GORE, SIGNALING HIS INDEPENDENCE FROM CLINTON, ANNOUNCES HIS
PRESIDENTIAL BID
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTHAGE, Tenn. _ Vice President Al Gore, signaling his
independence from President Clinton, promised moral leadership in
formally unveiling his ``New Horizon'' presidential candidacy
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you entrust me with the presidency, I will marshal its
authority, its resources and its moral leadership to fight for
America's families,'' Gore said from the steps of the Smith County
courthouse, the spot in Tennessee's hill country from which he
began his political career in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the nearly 8,000 people who jammed the main street of
this small town, the vice president promised to ``take my own
values of faith and family to the presidency, to build an America
that is not only better off, but better.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's remarks were designed to distance him from questions
about Clinton's character. They were sandwiched between comments to
reporters Tuesday and an ABC ``20/20'' interview broadcast
Wednesday night in which he said Clinton's extramarital affair and
lies about it were ``inexcusable.''
</P>
<P>
   But if anyone missed the contrast between the two men, Gore's
own family members and longtime friends reiterated the importance
to Gore of old-fashioned values _ the kind that, in political lore,
are to be found in small towns like Carthage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen how much he cares for his own children and for all
of our children, for his own family and for all of our families,''
said his eldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, who took over the
task of introducing her father to the crowd from her mother,
Tipper, who is suffering laryngitis. Schiff, 25, is expecting the
Gores' first grandchild in 11 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the kind of values you find on the courthouse squares
of Tennessee,'' said former Gov. Ned Ray McWherter, recalling how
Gore had sought his support in his first campaign for Congress 23
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Carthage itself, as a flag- and banner-bedecked backdrop for
Gore's announcement, helped send the subtle message that the vice
president is more connected to main street America and its values
than to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But in Washington, Republicans tried to undercut that message
with a publicity gimmick in which GOP National Chairman Jim
Nicholson rode a mule-driven cart to the luxurious downtown hotel
where Gore lived while his father was in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The stunt was a response to comments Gore made in March about
spending youthful summers plowing fields on his family's farm in
Carthage. The Gores currently own an 80-acre farm next to that
family farm.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson also ridiculed Gore's attempt to distance himself from
the president, recalling how Gore had defended Clinton last
December in a Rose Garden rally of Democrats following the House
vote to impeach the president. ``Al Gore has been the president's
biggest cheerleader,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore distanced himself from the president on ethical
matters Wednesday, he eagerly credited the president _ and, by
extension, himself _ for the current economic boom and the end of
ethnic brutality in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am proud that we refused to yield to the forces of barbarism
in Kosovo,'' he said. ``President Clinton was right to stand for
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   He contrasted the current economy with the 1992 recession that
helped drag down the re-election campaign of George Bush, thereby
subtly linking the current Republican presidential frontrunner,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, to his father's economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   And in doing so, he formulated a question similar to the one
posed by Ronald Reagan in his successful campaign to unseat Jimmy
Carter in 1980. Where Reagan asked, ``Are you better off now than
you were four years ago?,'' Gore asked, ``Will we turn back now _
or will we move forward?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not mention Bush by name. But he alluded to the GOP
frontrunner's well-publicized but largely undefined philosophy of
``compassionate conservatism'' in suggesting that the current
economic prosperity should continue ``the right way _ not by
letting people fend for themselves, or hoping for crumbs of
compassion, but by giving people the skills and knowledge to
succeed in their own right.''
</P>
<P>
   He also alluded to Bush's attempts to move his party beyond its
staunch opposition to abortion rights. ``Some try to duck the issue
of choice,'' he said. ``Not me. American women must be able to make
that decision for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore repeated many of the policy positions he has already staked
out: using religious organizations to combat social problems,
curtailing urban sprawl, strengthening gun control laws, stopping
the entertainment industry from marketing violence to children,
``revolutionary'' improvements in public education, a minimum wage
increase, a Patient's Bill of Rights, opposition to privatizing
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his remarks, however, focused on what he described as
``the crisis in the American family today,'' the result of new
``deficits'' that have replaced the nearly $200 billion federal
budget deficit that the Clinton-Gore administration inherited in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are our deficits now: the time deficit in family life;
the decency deficit in our common culture; the care deficit for our
little ones and our elderly parents,'' he said. ``Our families are
loving but over-stretched.''
</P>
<P>
   He occasionally sounded like Bush in promoting ``personal
responsibility'' and admonishing his own baby boomer generation to
``master'' their own lives in order to ``have the moral authority
to guide our children.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Gore's second campaign for the presidency. He ran in
1988, but did poorly. He declined to run in 1992, but Clinton,
after winning the nomination, chose him as his running mate. Prior
to becoming vice president, he served in the House of
Representatives before being elected to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, whose only opposition for the 2000 Democratic nomination
is former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, originally planned his
formal announcement in the fall. But with polls showing voter
``fatigue'' with Clinton affecting Gore, the vice president's
strategists moved up the announcement to begin distancing Gore from
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   From Carthage, Gore traveled to Iowa, the scene of the first
presidential balloting next year. He also will visit New Hampshire,
New York, California and Washington before returning to the
nation's capital.

 &HT;    GORE, SIGNALING HIS INDEPENDENCE FROM CLINTON, ANNOUNCES HIS
PRESIDENTIAL BID
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTHAGE, Tenn. _ Vice President Al Gore, signaling his
independence from President Clinton, promised moral leadership in
formally unveiling his ``New Horizon'' presidential candidacy
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you entrust me with the presidency, I will marshal its
authority, its resources and its moral leadership to fight for
America's families,'' Gore said from the steps of the Smith County
courthouse, the spot in Tennessee's hill country from which he
began his political career in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the nearly 8,000 people who jammed the main street of
this small town, the vice president promised to ``take my own
values of faith and family to the presidency, to build an America
that is not only better off, but better.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's remarks were designed to distance him from questions
about Clinton's character. They were sandwiched between comments to
reporters Tuesday and an ABC ``20/20'' interview broadcast
Wednesday night in which he said Clinton's extramarital affair and
lies about it were ``inexcusable.''
</P>
<P>
   But if anyone missed the contrast between the two men, Gore's
own family members and longtime friends reiterated the importance
to Gore of old-fashioned values _ the kind that, in political lore,
are to be found in small towns like Carthage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen how much he cares for his own children and for all
of our children, for his own family and for all of our families,''
said his eldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, who took over the
task of introducing her father to the crowd from her mother,
Tipper, who is suffering laryngitis. Schiff, 25, is expecting the
Gores' first grandchild in 11 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the kind of values you find on the courthouse squares
of Tennessee,'' said former Gov. Ned Ray McWherter, recalling how
Gore had sought his support in his first campaign for Congress 23
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Carthage itself, as a flag- and banner-bedecked backdrop for
Gore's announcement, helped send the subtle message that the vice
president is more connected to main street America and its values
than to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But in Washington, Republicans tried to undercut that message
with a publicity gimmick in which GOP National Chairman Jim
Nicholson rode a mule-driven cart to the luxurious downtown hotel
where Gore lived while his father was in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The stunt was a response to comments Gore made in March about
spending youthful summers plowing fields on his family's farm in
Carthage. The Gores currently own an 80-acre farm next to that
family farm.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson also ridiculed Gore's attempt to distance himself from
the president, recalling how Gore had defended Clinton last
December in a Rose Garden rally of Democrats following the House
vote to impeach the president. ``Al Gore has been the president's
biggest cheerleader,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore distanced himself from the president on ethical
matters Wednesday, he eagerly credited the president _ and, by
extension, himself _ for the current economic boom and the end of
ethnic brutality in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am proud that we refused to yield to the forces of barbarism
in Kosovo,'' he said. ``President Clinton was right to stand for
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   He contrasted the current economy with the 1992 recession that
helped drag down the re-election campaign of George Bush, thereby
subtly linking the current Republican presidential frontrunner,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, to his father's economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   And in doing so, he formulated a question similar to the one
posed by Ronald Reagan in his successful campaign to unseat Jimmy
Carter in 1980. Where Reagan asked, ``Are you better off now than
you were four years ago?,'' Gore asked, ``Will we turn back now _
or will we move forward?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not mention Bush by name. But he alluded to the GOP
frontrunner's well-publicized but largely undefined philosophy of
``compassionate conservatism'' in suggesting that the current
economic prosperity should continue ``the right way _ not by
letting people fend for themselves, or hoping for crumbs of
compassion, but by giving people the skills and knowledge to
succeed in their own right.''
</P>
<P>
   He also alluded to Bush's attempts to move his party beyond its
staunch opposition to abortion rights. ``Some try to duck the issue
of choice,'' he said. ``Not me. American women must be able to make
that decision for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore repeated many of the policy positions he has already staked
out: using religious organizations to combat social problems,
curtailing urban sprawl, strengthening gun control laws, stopping
the entertainment industry from marketing violence to children,
``revolutionary'' improvements in public education, a minimum wage
increase, a Patient's Bill of Rights, opposition to privatizing
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his remarks, however, focused on what he described as
``the crisis in the American family today,'' the result of new
``deficits'' that have replaced the nearly $200 billion federal
budget deficit that the Clinton-Gore administration inherited in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are our deficits now: the time deficit in family life;
the decency deficit in our common culture; the care deficit for our
little ones and our elderly parents,'' he said. ``Our families are
loving but over-stretched.''
</P>
<P>
   He occasionally sounded like Bush in promoting ``personal
responsibility'' and admonishing his own baby boomer generation to
``master'' their own lives in order to ``have the moral authority
to guide our children.''
</P>
<P>

AMWAY RIDES ONTO INTERNET VIA QUIXTAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BOB NORBERG   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Retailing giant Amway is taking its network
marketing business model, the foundation of its $5.7 billion a year
in annual sales, to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing to fruition an effort one year in the making, Amway on
Sept. 1 will open Quixtar, a spin-off company with an Internet site
that will sell Amway's well-known products, such as cleansers,
vitamins and beauty aids, and host as many as 200 other online
stores selling name-brand products.
</P>
<P>
   Though behind trailblazers like Amazon.com and online shopping
malls, Amway's entry to the Web will take direct marketing on the
Web to a new level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Amway 2000, it's the wave of the future,'' said Julie
McGee, a spokeswoman in Amway's Ada, Mich., headquarters. ``The
Internet is the way technology is going.''
</P>
<P>
   Amway is promoting the new venture with an Internet site,
www.countdown9199.com, which recruits investors but cloaks
Quixtar's link to Amway. Aggressive promotion is not new to Amway,
which relies on an expanding network of people's friends and
acquaintances to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was door-to-door stuff, or they would invite people over
to dinner and all of a sudden they'd be getting an Amway
presentation,'' said Ken Abernathy-Hansen of Santa Rosa, a longtime
Amway dealer who acknowledges that some Amway dealers didn't leave
the best impression.
</P>
<P>
   But Abernathy-Hansen says the consumer has to separate the
actions of some sales people from Amway the company, which he said
is ethical and offers people an opportunity to have their own small
business.
</P>
<P>
   John Parker, who holds the dual positions of director of
distributor relations for Amway and director of business relations
for Quixtar, said Quixtar will operate as a separate company from
Amway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quixtar is not a subsidiary nor a division of Amway, but a
sister company owned like Amway by the DeVos and Van Andel
families,'' Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said Quixtar will be an online site that provides
information and sells and promotes products depending on a buyer's
individual profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would my wife look like if she used a different color of
foundation and different shade of eye shadow? She could go online
and experiment with that,'' Parker said. ``In a virtual makeover,
she'll be able to enter information about her skin coloring and
then get information on what works together.''
</P>
<P>
   What hasn't changed is how Amway will be selling its products,
using multi-level marketing in which distributors, in this case
called ``independent business owners,'' refer people to the site
and earn commissions on sales.
</P>
<P>
   The business owners, who pay a $99.95 fee, also recruit others
to form a sales chain and earn commissions on the sales by owners
below them, much like Amway distributors now operate.
</P>
<P>
   As with Amway, the product is almost secondary to the sales
process. The Web site and pamphlets tout the potential for huge
sales on the Internet and the amount of money investors can earn.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said 360,000 have already registered to become
independent business owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way for hundreds of thousands of people to have their
own Web-based business without having the headaches and capital
expense,'' Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   People who are referred to the Quixtar site can opt to just make
purchases, with the commission going to the referring business
owner, or pay a fee to become a client, which earns them points on
purchases and makes them eligible for discounts.
</P>
<P>
   They can also decide to pay their own $99.95 fee and become part
of the Quixtar sales chain, getting commissions on their own
referrals and earning commissions for the business owners in the
chain above them.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is being sold to current Amway distributors as having
the potential to make them a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   With Amway, a distributor can earn $1,300 to $1,400 a month in
commissions if he buys $200 in goods a month and has in the
distribution chain beneath him 46 people who do the same, said
Harvey Bell, an Amway distributor in Rohnert Park, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Those signing on with Quixtar expect that income to double,
triple or even quadruple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a nice income with Amway, but I think it will go up many
fold,'' said Abernathy-Hansen. ``I'm sitting in a position to
triple my income with what I've already built. I expect my income
to be $5,000 to $6,000 a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Quixtar has posted information ``to educate and to motivate
potential Quixtar business participants about e-commerce'' on
Quixtar's site, www.quixtar.com, and the countdown tease site,
www.countdown9199.com.
</P>
<P>
   Quixtar's high-gloss, color brochures tout the potential of the
Internet and the explosive growth of online shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Financial details about Quixtar, which will be headquartered in
Ada and Grand Rapids, Mich., are few _ the names and even the
number of the other stores have not been released.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said the site make suggestions for products based on the
shopper's personal profile developed from information given by the
shopper.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said the advantage Quixtar has over other Internet sites
is that it can use its existing Amway network to attract traffic,
instead of having to purchase newspaper or television ads. And the
network to distribute the products is already in place.
</P>
<P>
   He said Quixtar is not expected to replace Amway.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long term, there is a place in the market for both
Amway and Quixtar,'' Parker said. ``The growth of the Internet is
significant, but we have a very significant business in the United
States and we see both businesses surviving.''

   BBN-CASEY _ CINCINNATI _ Sean Casey's deep blue eyes flash under
his tousled hair and he speaks in his gee-whiz conversational tone

Not long after his 34-inch, 32-ounce bat tore a path of destruction
through Kansas City for two days _ 10 hits that included two home
runs, a double and seven RBIs _ Casey thought about last weekend's
series against the Cleveland Indians and it was as if somebody
dropped a concrete block on his size 12 feet. ``Do you realize that
if I were still in the Cleveland organization I'd still be playing
at Triple-A Buffalo?'' Casey said. ``That's the truth. Since I can
only play first base and they wouldn't let me be a designated
hitter, I'd still be playing in the minor leagues because they have
Jim Thome and Richie Sexson.'' Fortunately for Casey and the
Cincinnati Reds, the Indians needed a starting pitcher and
reluctantly traded the 24-year-old first baseman for Dave Burba
less than 24 hours before Burba was to pitch Opening Day 1998 for
the Reds. (McCoy, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

<P>
   If the millions of desktop computers in the world could be
stacked into a great wall, the resulting construction might
resemble some enormous Louise Nevelson sculpture dominated by one
oppressive shape: the box.
</P>
<P>
   The BUB, the computer industry's self-mocking acronym for Big
Ugly Box, has ruled computer design for years. Now a wave of design
innovation, or imitation, is cresting at personal computer
companies looking for a way to break out of the box.
</P>
<P>
   Packard Bell NEC, owned by NEC Corp. and Groupe Bull, planned to
formally announce Thursday the release of the Z1, a powerful $2,500
desktop that entirely does away with the box, bulky or otherwise.
At first glance, the Z1 _ which comes with 96 megabytes of SDRAM,
or synchronous dynamic random access memory _ looks like little
more than a flat-screen monitor looming over a keyboard (which is
wireless and has buttons that can do the job of a mouse).
</P>
<P>
   Most of the computer's vital components, usually placed in a
large box, have been made to fit into little more than a slight
bulge behind the sliver of monitor.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Gateway introduced the Profile, a sleek desktop PC
for which prices start at $2,000, that manages to make its
formidable electronic innards so compact that the computer and its
monitor can easily take up no more space on the top of the desk
than a sheet of typing paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PC has become the dashboard of our lives,'' said Jeff
Hensen, the marketing manager for Gateway. ``As the technology
becomes more pervasive, there's a need to make it less intrusive,
no matter what environment you are in.''
</P>
<P>
   The new emphasis on PC design has come in the wake of last
spring's stylish darling, the colorful iMac from Apple, but it is
being driven by the advent of flat-screen monitors. The trend began
earlier this year with the release of Sony's gray and lavender VAIO
Slimtop PCV-L600 and with the blue and gray 320 Visual Workstation,
the first consumer-oriented Windows NT machine from Silicon
Graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike notebook computers, long the masters of PC
miniaturization, the two new all-in-one PC's _ in which the
computer and monitor are combined _ do not compromise memory
capacity, storage and processing power for the sake of reduced size
and attractive looks. While both possess lines that would make them
look at home on a museum pedestal, the Z1 packs one of the most
powerful microprocessors, a 450-megahertz Pentium III, and the
Profile uses a new 400-MHz Advanced Micro Devices K6-2 XT
processor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What PC makers are realizing is that design sells,'' said
Lowell Goss, the creative director for Frog, a major industrial
design and communications consulting company based in Sunnyvale,
Calif. Frog helped define the black, minimalist look of the Sony
Trinitron television 20 years ago as well as some of the early
Apple computer designs.
</P>
<P>
   For years, computers were sold by their technology, like
speedier microprocessors, bigger hard drives and more clever
circuit boards. But the nature of the PC business, where high
profit margins depend on assembling new machines quickly using
standardized components, has not been fertile ground for design
innovation and ingenuity, Goss said. But as the field of computer
makers grows more crowded and the prices flatten out, the pressure
to create something that looks distinctive has increased.
</P>
<P>
   The computer that recently brought the subject of design to
public attention was, of course, the iMAC, but that wasn't the
first radical makeover for a computer box. In 1996, Acer's Aspire,
for example, featured rippled edges and a colorful shell with
ventilation holes that looked as if they had been made with
buckshot. But it failed to catch the public's imagination like the
iMac has.
</P>
<P>
   ``The iMac has eaten everyone's lunch,'' Goss said. ``What galls
PC makers is that the iMac is a high-margin machine.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Z1 and Profile have very different genealogies than the
iMac. What is giving rise to the flashy new desktop PC's, said Tim
Bajarian, president of Creative Strategies in San Jose, Calif., is
the flat-panel monitor, almost the antithesis of the iMAC's
retro-curvy box; in this area, the Japanese have been pioneers.
Flat-panel monitors, generally costing four times as much as
conventional monitors, are being used as the cornerstone of these
supersleek computers for a simple reason: profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question in our mind that the future of computer
design is really being defined by the Japanese,'' Bajarian said.
``The motivation is not necessarily, `Let's be innovative,' as much
as it is, `Let's get traditional PC users to see how exciting these
computers with flat screens are and sell them at higher prices.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Omae, vice president for marketing at Sony, said that design
was important to the company when it started making PC's several
years ago. ``We introduced a well-designed PC,'' he said. ``Sony
wanted customers proud of owning a PC.''
</P>
<P>
   Sony made its PC's with new colors and materials. The Slimtop's
sleek box, about the size of two closed laptops laid one on top of
another, was achieved by replacing the standard monitor with a
flat-screen liquid crystal display and integrating notebook-like
technologies to this desktop computer. And that was achieved
without reducing performance and function. The Slimtop is anchored
with a 500-MHz Pentium III processor and a 10.8-gigabyte hard
drive.
</P>
<P>
   When Silicon Graphics, a longtime major company in the powerful
professional work station market, wanted to offer its first Windows
NT machine for a new market this year, it was concerned with the
computer's look as well as its performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make a statement,'' said Cliff Apsey, director of
product marketing for the company's work station division. The 320
sports a 17.3-inch flat-screen monitor and a tower that looks like
a two-toned, asymmetrical silo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is esthetically pleasing, then it adds an extra aura
around the whole product,'' Apsey said. ``But it's one thing to
deliver a nice-looking product. You have to back it up with what's
inside.''

 UNDATED: what's inside.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the design approach of the new breed of PC's, like the Z1
and Profile, however, should not confused with that of the much
less expensive iMac. While the colorful iMac eliminated the box,
which has traditionally been beige, it has a standard 15-inch
cathode-ray-tube monitor. The iMac is an all-in-one computer that
is, for most purposes, a what-you-see-is-what-you-get machine. The
user can add memory to an iMac but cannot significantly upgrade it
in other ways, such as by adding a bigger monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The new all-in-one PC machines offer great flexibility. The Z1,
which hides its 8.4-gigabyte hard drive in its base, offers a rear
panel for easy access to inner components and fast upgrades. It
also permits users to remove the screen easily and snap in an
18-inch flat-screen monitor. And like a laptop computer, the Z1,
which will be shipped in August, features two PC Card Type II or a
Type III PCMCIA slots along with four Universal Serial Bus slots.
</P>
<P>
   ``In designing the Z1, we set out to challenge the traditional
beige computer box,'' said Gordon Chapple, executive vice president
of Packard Bell NEC's consumer division. In January, he told the
Z1's designers to come up a computer that was ``elegant,
sophisticated and friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Layered into that statement was `break the rules,''' said
Peter Wyatt-Brandenburg, project manager and senior designer at
Hauser Inc., an industrial design and product development company
in Westlake Village, Calif., that did most of the design work on
the Z1. ``If we didn't push it, there was no reason to be doing the
program.''
</P>
<P>
   After preliminary talks last December, Hauser was given the
go-ahead in January. The five-person design team, housed in an open
loftlike building with its own duck pond about 40 miles north of
Los Angeles, went to work on what a Packard Bell NEC executive
called a ``project without borders.''
</P>
<P>
   The designers looked at other consumer electronics devices that
have become familiar in many American homes, like notebook
computers and digital cameras. An in-house anthropologist gave the
team insights about how people relate to their machines.

<P>
   ``For a long time we talked about it like a coffee-table
computer, something that would look good from all angles, not this
thing with a bad end to it where all the cords come out,''
Wyatt-Brandenburg said.
</P>
<P>
   After guiding their ideas through a series of foam models and
prototypes, Wyatt-Brandenburg said, the design for the Z1, code
named Zuma, emerged in about three weeks. Mal Ransom, senior vice
president for marketing at Packard Bell NEC's consumer division,
sat in the Hauser offices recently, looking pleased as he admired a
preproduction model of the Z1. ``We are ecstatic about the outcome
of the project,'' he told the designers.
</P>
<P>
   But Hauser and Packard Bell NEC officials say they tried to not
overshoot the expectations of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the designers intentionally placed the Z1's DVD and
floppy drives in plain view so that consumers, long used to a
separate computer box and monitor, would not mistake this two-toned
metallic blue PC for merely an overpriced flat-panel monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the other big desktop players are being far more
conservative. While International Business Machines designers
recently announced the creation of a wearable Walkman-sized PC, the
company's desktop computers continue to look very much as they have
for years _ boxy. A spokeswoman for Compaq, another pioneer in PC
design and manufacturing, said that company is not making a new
slim PC like the V1.
</P>
<P>
   And in a meeting earlier this year with technology writers and
editors from The New York Times, Michael Dell, chairman of the Dell
Computer Corp., said he did not envision big changes in how his
company makes its desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
   So Moore's Law, which says the capacity of computer chips
doubles every 18 months, appears to be holding true for the insides
of computers, but there doesn't seem to be an equivalent axiom for
the outsides of computers _ at least, not yet.

WHEN BIG BOOKS FALL A LITTLE FLAT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It happens in publishing more often than even sophisticated
readers realize and certainly more than anyone in the business
would like. There are great expectations that a particular book
will break out and become a big-time popular success, its future
guaranteed. Abundant press coverage and good reviews fuel that fire
of anticipation. Then there's no ice cream cone at the end.
</P>
<P>
   That can be heartbreak time, because everyone involved with the
specific book did everything right. There was the splashiest
publication party of the year, and a tub-thumping publicity
campaign that produced a load of press clippings almost voluptuous
in their delights. The author's television and radio interviews
were hip, humorous, inviting, and there are more to come as his
book tour continues.
</P>
<P>
   Reviews ranged from good to raves. Moreover, in one way or
another, the book's subject matter touches nearly everyone's life.
Yet in the mysterious nature of the publishing world, with all of
this going for it, the book still does not become a big national
best seller: successful by some measures but falling short of wow.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent case of this strange publishing ontology is Kurt
Andersen's huge novel ``Turn of the Century'' (Random House), a
sprawling, satirical and often funny work set in the year 2000.
Seemingly, as fiction, it has it all, in a way that says Now!: the
media universe, cyberspace, Wall Street, Manhattan, Hollywood,
Silicon Valley, society being confounded by the very communication
devices that are supposed to make people's lives easier. In short,
it sends up everything Americans supposedly hold dear.
</P>
<P>
   So fingers were crossed that if it didn't actually become this
season's ``Bonfire of the Vanities,'' Tom Wolfe's mighty 1987 best
seller, the new book had the potential for a reach in that
direction and would be a powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Andersen's novel is a success in ways that can make an
author proud. Few first novels get as good or as many reviews,
although the number may in part be because of Andersen's celebrity
in the world he wrote about as co-founder of Spy magazine and staff
writer for The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   The book arrived the first week in May with a printing of 65,000
copies, very large for a literary first novel but fair for a
popular novel. Since then it has gone back to print twice, bringing
the total to 72,000 copies available for stores. So far ``Turn of
the Century'' has been on The Los Angeles Times, The San Francisco
Chronicle and Newsday best-seller lists, and has been No. 15 on the
Amazon.com hard-cover fiction list, but not near the top of Barnes
&AMP; Noble's list. Nor has it made The New York Times' or Publisher's
Weekly lists, which are the only two national lists. Still, most
novels never make any lists.
</P>
<P>
   Random House says it has earned back it's six-figure advance. A
paperback house has guaranteed a minimum price it will pay to buy
``Turn of the Century'' for publication. Foreign rights have been
sold in five countries, but so far there is no movie sale, and that
may be a matter of bad timing.
</P>
<P>
   Books into movies is often cyclic. With the high cost of
production, Hollywood is in an interval in which only blockbuster
books will be easily sold to the movies or to television.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Andersen was on Charlie Rose, Conan O'Brien and cable shows,
and he is booked for ``Politically Incorrect,'' all of which give a
book a glamorous pop. All promotion opportunities first novelists
would kill for.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own expectations have been far exceeded,'' Andersen said.
``I was amazed and happy with overwhelming reviews, and with the
best-seller lists I've made. I feel as though I won the lottery,
the $10 million one, if not the $20 million one. I'm a first
novelist. To book buyers in America I'm not Grisham, Smith,
Harris.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a conventional commercial novel that everyone can
read in three hours,'' he said. ``I wrote it to be a good book, one
that I would like. It's a big, fat, dense first novel, and I can't
tell you how pleased I am to be around the top 10 on some lists.''
</P>
<P>
   There are as many theories about why a particular book doesn't
burst out of the stores and into comfortable niches on the
important best-seller lists as there are titles that are expected
to but don't.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen's book, for instance, is huge, 659 pages; heavier than
many people want to lug in their tote bags. It can be amusing and
insightful, but also difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of the novel is too inside-y, too geared to the
knowing of the New York, Washington and Los Angeles and their
satellites. They are interested in media types, but how many care
in North Carolina or Iowa?
</P>
<P>
   One theory is that its title and its rather documentarylike
cover confuse readers into thinking it's yet another serious
nonfiction book about this century or this or that generation or,
worse yet, about the next millennium, which seems to be boring
people before it's even started. There's even this inside joke: The
novel's natural constituents, media types, all got free copies.
</P>
<P>
   Does this book have a future? Ann Godoff, its publisher, quite
naturally answers with a resounding yes.
</P>
<P>
   She said: ``Word of mouth is the way books ultimately catch on,
and I think this is one of the great word-of-mouth books. Our
numbers are strong, just not that strong yet. It's selling very
well, with best-seller numbers in some places.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It needs another fix, and I think we have enough ammunition
left to make it a summer read that takes off,'' she said. ``It has
a real story, a real plot. It's a real novel that should have legs
beyond it's first month.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Godoff is a tough competitor. She said that if the
best-seller lists didn't have an ``event book'' on them _ Thomas
Harris' ``Hannibal'' (Delacorte) _ and ``weren't clogged up with
stuff that shouldn't be there,'' Andersen would already be on the
major national lists. That's an old refrain in publishing.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that The Times' hard-cover best-seller list has three
children's books and two dead authors on it. But, hey, that's the
stew pot of book publishing.

SITE-SEEING: MONEY MANAGEMENT FOR WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LAURIE J. FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Homer's ancient world, Cassandra was a beautiful Trojan
princess upon whom the god Apollo bestowed the gift of prophecy.
But when Cassandra refused to repay his generosity with sexual
favors, Apollo put a curse on her: her prophecies _ all of disaster
_ would be accurate but nobody would understand or believe her.
</P>
<P>
   The Cassandra myth has been adopted by the modern investment
community as a metaphor for foretelling disaster. For Ellen McGirt,
the stockbroker-turned-Web-site-producer behind Cassandra's
Revenge, the tale (adjusting it liberally) is a metaphor for the
plight of women seeking to become investors.
</P>
<P>
   Given the right information, Ms. McGirt said, women should learn
to trust their own prophecies and heed their own investment advice.
</P>
<P>
   For many women, that's a stretch. According to Merrill Lynch's
Ninth Annual Retirement and Financial Planning Survey, for 1998,
most American women simply do not feel well prepared for making
investment choices. Only 57 percent of women surveyed said they
felt comfortable (compared with 78 percent of men).
</P>
<P>
   The average woman will spend fewer years in the labor force than
the average man.
</P>
<P>
   To Ms. McGirt, this fact makes women far more vulnerable to
money problems than men, given that they have less exposure to
investment opportunities, retirement contributions and other
advantages of employment.
</P>
<P>
   The Web can help. The early years of the Web saw the rise of
numerous innovative small investment sites. Sadly but perhaps not
surprisingly, by now most of them have disappeared, squeezed out in
part by the onslaught of women's megasites.
</P>
<P>
   On those larger sites would-be investors can usually expect to
find a predictable mix of investment advice columns, on topics like
saving for your children's college education and for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   What these sites try to provide is a comfortable place for women
to seek information, form investment clubs and ask questions of
experts and peers, all without leaving their desks. And then there
are sites that, like the mythical superwoman, try to do it all, by
providing scores of financial calculators and dishing out empirical
advice on investment strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, there is no embarrassment of riches here; only a
handful of these sites offer the appropriate tools along with the
depth of research necessary for serious investors.
</P>
<P>
   CASSANDRA'S REVENGE
</P>
<P>
   www.cassandrasrevenge.com
</P>
<P>
   As with its name, this site is as heavy on attitude as it is
with information and is the perfect starting point for first-time
female investors trying to boost their confidence and learn the
basics. (Surprisingly, despite the site's female orientation,
nearly a third of its regular visitors are men.) Cassandra's
Revenge is geared toward serious beginners, and the material found
there is deeper than it is broad. You won't find financial
calculators or stock tables. Instead, there is an articles section
with clever and easily understood writing by the site's founder,
Ellen McGirt, on everything from initial public offerings and Roth
IRAs to investing in collectibles and planning for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McGirt takes a moderate approach to stock trading, advising
her readers to pick from a number of carefully described strategies
to find one that suits their ``goals, financial situation and
personality.'' And then, she warns, expect to win some and lose
some (and with some patience, come out ahead in the long run).
</P>
<P>
   From the site's home page you can link to a stock-trading
simulator called Wall Street Connection that lets you pretend to
buy and sell stocks without risking any real money.
</P>
<P>
   It is a useful exercise and a good confidence builder, and it
can put you in touch with other women just getting their feet wet
in investing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McGirt, who writes and produces Cassandra's Revenge, is a
full-time finance writer and former stockbroker. Single and in her
late 30s, she manages to understand the needs of professional
women, homemakers, retirees and even widows equally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, there is plenty of information specifically for
women,'' Ms. McGirt writes on the site. ``It's called information.
It doesn't have to be gender specific. The key will be the attitude
you bring to the process. So trust yourself and get going.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Cassandra's Revenge can provide a much-needed
pep talk for women intimidated by the notion of investing.
</P>
<P>
   KA-CHING
</P>
<P>
   www.ka-ching.com
</P>
<P>
   This well-designed and informative site was developed by Oxygen
Media, a television and Internet start-up headed by Geraldine
Laybourne, the former Nickelodeon executive. (Its list of
well-heeled investors includes Oprah Winfrey and the television
producer Caryn Mandabach.) So it's no wonder that Ka-Ching (think
cash register) tries to entertain while it informs.
</P>
<P>
   Here, female investors should find everything they need for
researching investments short of actually making a trade. The tools
section is particularly strong, featuring a financial calculator
for every occasion, like saving for college and retirement,
calculating and consolidating debt or paying off a mortgage. A
portfolio section lets you track investments, get stock quotes and
even link to one of four electronic brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   The site's editorial content serves up less attitude than
Cassandra's Revenge (even Ellen McGirt, who writes and produces
Cassandra's Revenge and is a regular contributor, tones things down
for Ka-Ching), but its articles offer equally helpful advice, as
well as profiles of financially successful women.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   A recent article, for example, was a profile of a young mother
who started her own capital management firm; another article looked
at the importance of prenuptial agreements. And an entire section
of Ka-Ching is devoted to financing the care of elderly parents,
offering analyses of issues like guardianship and special trusts.
</P>
<P>
   With its attractive combination of tools and advice, Ka-Ching is
clearly the strongest among the overall investment sites for women.
</P>
<P>
   WIFE.ORG
</P>
<P>
   www.wife.org
</P>
<P>
   Don't let the name fool you _ this site, produced by the
nonprofit Women's Institute for Financial Education in San Diego,
offers a selection of resources for women of all ages and
circumstances. But its creator, Ginita Wall, is a financial planner
specializing in the issues surrounding divorce. For women in the
process of divorce and trying to sort out the financial mess, this
is the site to use.
</P>
<P>
   Wife.org offers an eclectic mix of articles. Though not
exhaustive, they cover some of the important bases. And the tone of
the articles is generally warm and assuring. Recently, there was
even a primer titled ``The Dow Industrials: What Are They?''
</P>
<P>
   The articles at Wife.org are well written and well presented,
but the overall editorial offering is thin compared with other
sites reviewed here.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some women will find the site to be a great resource,
particularly if they are running a household single-handedly or in
the midst of a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   MONEY MODE
</P>
<P>
   www.womenswire.com/money
</P>
<P>
   One of the big problems any investor faces is information
overload, and with investing being among the most popular
activities on the Web, the load is getting heavier. The
well-organized Money Mode site produced by the Women.com network
tackles that problem by helping both novices and seasoned investors
find just what they need.
</P>
<P>
   What is notable about Money Mode is that it is produced in
conjunction with Bloomberg, a major force in stock market news and
information that supplies much of site's financial data and all of
its calculators. Bloomberg's presence alone makes the site worth
taking note of, and you can be sure the information is accurate and
reliable.
</P>
<P>
   It also means this site does a good job of tracking events that
affect the stock market, with more news articles, constantly posted
and updated, than the other sites.
</P>
<P>
   One of Money Mode's more interesting features is the
Bloomberg/Women.com 30, an index of 30 publicly traded companies
run by women that the site tracks on a daily basis. So if it is
important to you to invest in companies with a good track record
for promoting women, this index will come in handy.
</P>
<P>
   Though you may find everything you need to make informed
investments on Money Mode, one thing you won't find is a heavy
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   IVILLAGE MONEYLIFE
</P>
<P>
   www.ivillagemoneylife.com
</P>
<P>
   The women's online network Ivillage is notable for the sheer
volume of information it offers: its Moneylife site is exhaustive.
If you are not accustomed to the cute language of some women's
magazines, Moneylife may take you aback, or even get on your
nerves.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in a section called Market Maven, a financial
planner, Adriane Berg, suggests that stocks are like men _ ``Some
are good for a night out and some for long-term relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you are a regular reader of cover headlines at the
checkout counter, you will feel right at home _ and you'll find
there is a lot to learn on this site.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of useful resources hidden behind the glitz, in
six categories: Starting Out, Couples and Kids, Market Maven,
Suddenly Single, Deep in Debt and Retire Rich. In each section, you
will find well-written articles and the opportunity to chat on the
topic.
</P>
<P>
   There are articles on debt management and cutting retirement
costs, for example, and nearly every investment calculator you are
likely to need. You will also find more personal articles, about
how to stop fighting with your spouse about money, for example, and
the overall importance of spending time with your children.
</P>
<P>
   Ivillage places a huge emphasis on bulletin boards and live
chat, giving participants the chance to sound off on most issues
that come up or to connect with other women in similar situations.
There is a debt recovery group, for example, as well as bulletin
boards for dozens of investment clubs.
</P>
<P>
   SHE'S GOT IT TOGETHER: www.shesgotittogether.com A relatively
new and still underdeveloped site from the publishers of Profit
Magazine, but worth watching.
</P>
<P>
   PINKBULL: www.pinkbull.com Includes the well-written Pinkbull
Market Report, news stories and stock quotes, as well as investment
tools.
</P>
<P>
   FABULOUS MARKET BABE: www.fabmktbabe.com Written by a woman with
both men and women in mind, this site has an irreverent and often
snide tone, but the information appears reliable as well as
occasionally entertaining.

 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO, June 16 _ Rain was whiplashing downtown Chicago, and in
a patch of land near wind-raked Lake Michigan, all that could
really be seen was a herd of citrus yellow backhoes, along with
mounds of fudgy dirt. But in the imagination of architect Frank O.
Gehry, who was seeing the site for the first time, the picture was
altogether different.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could make it a dining facility in the winter and open it
up in the summer, flip up the front,'' Gehry mused. ``The other
thing that would be fun to do is to integrate film.''
</P>
<P>
   Gehry was spying out the possibilities for his Chicago debut, a
two-acre space at the heart of the city's jewel-like lakefront that
he has been asked to turn into a music pavilion complete with
proscenium arch, pedestrian bridge and Central Park-like Great
Lawn.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the quick tour, Gehry was toying with the idea of
launching fireworks from the top of the music shell and salting the
Great Lawn with thousands of ear-level speakers. ``They do it
indoors in the Russian Parliament,'' he said. ``Don't know if it's
ever been done outside.''
</P>
<P>
   And whatever he comes up with will have to be flexible enough to
embrace everything from a Bach fugue to the Rolling Stones, he
said. ``Especially if we do something spectacular,'' he said,
``everybody will want to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   After the stunning success of his Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao,
Spain, everyone, it seems, wants Frank Gehry to do something
spectacular. He has received calls from all over Europe, from
China, from South America, he said, all from people who ``want to
do the Bilbao thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Chicago, the cradle of American architecture, home of the
Hancock Building and the Sears Tower, font of such illustrious
creators as Louis Sullivan, Frank Lloyd Wright and Ludwig Mies van
der Rohe, the prospect of a Frank Gehry production has even greater
significance _ and, in architecture circles it is generating a
burst of controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Many architects and civic leaders relish the chance for Chicago
to capture the creativity of a world-renowned architect like Gehry,
acclaimed as he is for his sculptural technique and ability to bend
lines, tilt angles and play with light. Some architecture
aficionados feel that the city has lost some of the inventiveness
that spawned the skyscraper, the cantilevered house and those glass
and steel boxes. And it has hardly escaped city officials that
enlisting Gehry to build part of Chicago's $200 million Millennium
Park project just might give tourism a boost.
</P>
<P>
   But in the birthplace of the skyscraper, a city where
architecture is venerated, some architects worry that Gehry's
fragmented style would go against the grain. On top of that, other
architects consider handing such a plum commission to an outsider _
a celebrity from California, no less _ almost a slap in the face to
Chicago's homegrown talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if the French started importing wine,'' said Laurence
Booth, who designed a dormitory for the school of the Art Institute
of Chicago. ``What do they think? Nobody can do something here?''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel P. Coffey, who recently redesigned Chicago's prized
Oriental Theater, cited a string of outsider projects like the Navy
pier and the Museum of Contemporary Art in recent years that have
hit the city with an uninspiring thud.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Chicago's millennium, and what do we do?'' he said. ``We
go get somebody from Los Angeles. Who's a great architect _ I'm not
saying he's not _ but I think the millennium is supposed to be a
time for surprise and thrilling and all that stuff, a time to
regenerate. It's disappointing we can't regenerate here in the city
by ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also some skepticism about the project Gehry has been
asked to create. His pavilion and accouterments will not stand off
by themselves, a self-contained Gehry showcase. Rather, his project
will be part of a much larger city park whose other elements are
being designed by architects with markedly different styles.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of Millennium Park will be designed by the
Chicago-based firm Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill. It will be a
conscious continuation of the Beaux-Arts style that characterizes
much of Grant Park, the sprawling front yard of Chicago to which
Millennium Park will be attached. There will be antique street
lights, formal garden paths and fluted columns in a grand
peristyle, none of which bear much resemblance to anything Frank
Gehry does.
</P>
<P>
   His design will also have to mesh with an underground music and
dance theater with a greenhouse-like entrance to be designed by
Thomas Beeby, a Chicago architect. And Gehry has been asked to
consider design seating on the Great Lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first glance, it's like asking Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and
Jimi Hendrix to perform a duet,'' wrote Blair Kamin, the
architecture critic for The Chicago Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   Booth said, ``This whole business of bringing on somebody exotic
_ I'm not sure the strategy is architectural as much as
promotional.'' He added, ``With so many different materials and no
consistent school, we can be overcome by novelty and lose the
spirit of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Gehry, a slightly rumpled 70-year-old who exhibits none of the
slickness or ennui that one might expect to accompany fame,
believes that kind of thinking is misguided, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't take different ideas in Chicago, then where can
you?'' he said. ``Read Carl Sandburg. Get a life. What happens when
Philip Glass comes to town _ you don't let him in?''
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Smith, a partner of Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill who asked
Gehry to design the pavilion, said it was the architect's
adventurousness that prompted him to extend the invitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that in this one space it was important to break out''
of the existing Grant Park architecture, Smith said. ``Then I
thought, this would also be a great piece that hopefully brings a
lot of tourists into the city, and a lot of excitement back to
architecture in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So far Gehry has about $25 million to play with, $15 million of
that coming from the Pritzker Foundation, run by the prominent
family of Chicagoans who also give out architecture's most
prestigious honor, the Pritzker Prize. Gehry won it in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Almost diffidently, Gehry insists that the success of the Bilbao
museum has not changed him much. (When a breakfast waiter at
Chicago's Ritz-Carlton spilled coffee on his pants, Gehry fretted
that the episode would ruin the waiter's day.)
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I basically operate out of insecurity _ each new job is
scary,'' he said. ``But it's certainly given me a higher profile.
People say a lot of nice things, and the people who don't say nice
things are interested too.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who are interested ``want an instant thing for
their city,'' he said. ``I turn them down. I'm too old for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he has chosen projects that grab him, for people that
he likes. They include the Weatherhead School of Management at Case
Western Reserve University in Cleveland, a performing arts center
at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., and a cafeteria for
the new Conde Nast building in Times Square. His celebrity helped
get him more money to complete the long-delayed Walt Disney Concert
Hall in Los Angeles. And he is designing a major new building for
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's computer and
information science departments.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, ``I've taken on a lot of little tiny
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The Basques back in Bilbao have asked him to build a winery. He
is designing a Ronald McDonald House in Germany and, free of
charge, a couple of recreation centers for oncology hospitals in
Scotland and England. And he is particularly excited about a
pottery museum in Biloxi, Miss., that will be a showcase for the
work of George Orr, ``the mad potter of Biloxi,'' he said. ``It's a
small job, but I love Orr's pottery.''
</P>
<P>
   Over an egg-white omelet at the Ritz cafe (whose ornate decor he
dismissed as ``ongepotchket,'' or excessively embellished), Gehry
said he was tantalized by the chance to work in Chicago, ``the
architecture city of America.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child growing up in the gold-mining town of Timmins,
Ontario, he was entranced by a few trips here with his father, who
sold pinball machines and jukeboxes. Sitting at the Ritz just off
Mies van der Rohe Way, he rattled off any number of Chicago
structures he likes: the sleek, form-is-function Hancock Building,
the extravagantly Gothic Tribune Tower, the whimsical corn cob
cylinders of Marina City.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be contributing to the architecture of Chicago _ it's a
daunting task,'' he said, leaning forward with a shy grin. ``Pray
for me.'' Ways to Blend &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Smith, whose firm worked with Gehry in Barcelona, building a
hotel in a plaza where Gehry created a giant flying fish sculpture,
sees several ways Millennium Park could work out well.
</P>
<P>
   Gehry could, for instance, build part of his pavilion out of
stone, picking up on the ``neo-classical vocabulary'' of the rest
of the park. Or he could create something of ``a completely
different character and texture'' that would be a self-contained,
``very defined inset'' in the park. Of course, Smith said, there
should be some limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I don't agree with Frank about, I don't like
unbridled chaos,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Kamin, the Tribune critic, wrote that he hoped the project would
``let Gehry be Gehry,'' and would resemble ``one of those
old-fashioned pieces of candy where you're treated to a chewy gum
ball inside.'' He added, ``Certainly that would be a better outcome
for Chicago's tribute to the millennium than one in which the
flavors fight one another, leaving the visitor with a sour
aftertaste.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gehry is being noncommittal about his vision,
saying, ``I never really design anything until I understand all the
options and possibilities and uses.''
</P>
<P>
   He has experience with outdoor musical spaces, having redesigned
the Hollywood Bowl, and ``you could say I've trained for this
job,'' he said. ``I hang out with musicians a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   And he is not worried about clashing architectural cultures.
After all, one of the impressive things architecture critics have
pointed out about the Bilbao museum is the unexpected way it merges
with its gritty urban context
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there'll be harmony,'' Gehry said. ``I usually respect
the environment I'm in. I treat it as a neighbor. And I've studied
classical architecture. I use it as a foundation for my work. It's
not like I come out of the ether.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All the same,'' he added, ``I don't think there's ever been a
question that I would do what I do.''

FATHER'S DAY GIFTS CONFUSION
</HEADLINE>
  (For release June 18)  
(rk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is clearly a lot of confusion surrounding Father's Day,
the most recent evidence being a story titled, ``20 Ways To Make
Dad's Day.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of story that a woman might read and say to
herself, ``Well, aren't those some clever and imaginative ideas for
Father's Day gifts!''
</P>
<P>
   It was also the kind of story that a man might read and say to
himself, ``If I move to Alaska now and change my name, she'll never
find me.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked several male friends for their reaction to the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first question I asked myself,'' said my golf buddy,
Blowhole, ``was, `What woman wrote this?'''
</P>
<P>
   My attorney, Jaws, said one word kept repeating itself in his
head as he read the story. ``Divorce. Divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Start a worm farm?'' howled my 13-year-old son, quoting one of
the more reasonable suggestions in the list of 20.
</P>
<P>
   I feel certain that the (female) writer of the story did not
intend to cause such fear and loathing among males, which makes the
whole thing doubly scary. She undoubtedly thought that these were
things that would make Dad happy on Father's Day, the kind of
miscommunication that makes the
Men-Are-From-Mars/Women-Are-From-Venus thing seem like a mind meld
by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the number one suggestion: ``Have a lawn and garden day.
Bring lots of power tools. Rent a chipper shredder, power washer or
tiller, and help Dad get the back yard in order. Spread some grass
seed or just go hog wild and install an automatic sprinkler
system!''
</P>
<P>
   Call me old-fashioned, but to me nothing says Father's Day like
a nice case of sun stroke with a few sliced-off fingers and toes
thrown in for good measure. The trail of blood on the carpet, the
frantic call to 911 and the wild ride in the back of the ambulance
to the hospital emergency room guarantee that this will be a day
Dad will not soon forget, assuming he lives through it.
</P>
<P>
   Number two: ``Plan an overnight camping trip. Yes, one where you
sleep in a tent, by the fire, in the woods.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two possibilities here: Either the writer has never
attempted to sleep in a tent in the woods in Florida in late June
or else she wants to punish her husband for the jumper cables he
bought her last Mother's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Number seven (and my personal favorite): ``Send him on a
surprise trip to visit relatives he hasn't seen in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh, maybe there's a reason he hasn't seen those relatives in a
while and that reason is: HE CAN'T STAND THEM!
</P>
<P>
   Haven't you noticed that just the mere mention of visiting these
people sends your husband spiraling into a black hole of depression
that no amount of Prozac will help him escape?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is the explanation for the recent rash of ``air
rage'' where guys drink way too much and try to punch a hole
through the emergency exit: They've been sent on a ``surprise''
visit to hated relatives by their spouse.
</P>
<P>
   Number 12: ``Start a worm farm. He'll never have to buy bait
again!''
</P>
<P>
   What with installing automatic sprinkler systems, visiting
undesirable relatives and slapping mosquitoes in a 120-degree tent,
it's unlikely that Dad will have the time or the energy to do much
fishing. But even if he does, does he really need his own worm farm
to supply his personal bait needs? This seems rather like building
your own nuclear reactor to supply your personal plutonium needs.
</P>
<P>
   Which, come to think of it, might be another fun activity for
Dad this Father's Day.

LEGAL PITFALLS ARE EASY TO FIND ALONG WITH MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID KUSHNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The heart of the MP3 controversy is the copyright issue. Because
of the ease of moving digital files from CD to computer and from
computer to computer, executives at major recording labels are
concerned that their artists' music will be illegally copied.
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Association of America tried
unsuccessfully to prevent Diamond Multimedia from releasing the
Rio, a portable MP3 player, because of the potential for piracy.
(Diamond recently announced that it would include special
encryption features to address the problem.)
</P>
<P>
   Some artists want to retain copyright themselves, deciding on
their own whether to distribute music over the Net for a fee. The
rapper Chuck D recently made his group Public Enemy's latest album,
``There's a Poison Goin' On,'' available in its entirety before it
was released on CD.
</P>
<P>
   The MP3 format is legal but can be used illegally. On sites like
MP3.com, many unsigned artists have granted permission for surfers
to download their songs, which is legal. But on sites where
permission hasn't been granted, copying those songs is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Prerecorded music _ a CD, for example _ can be copied to a tape
cassette or to an MP3 format for personal use, to listen to on a
computer or portable player. That copy cannot legally be given,
traded or sold to anyone else.

   &UR; High-Quality Playback From Apple Computer &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer last week officially released Quicktime 4, the
latest version of its multimedia software for Windows and Macintosh
systems. Quicktime 4 (which can be downloaded from
www.apple.com/quicktime) offers high-quality playback for both
streaming and stored video and audio files, a component that can
display video and image files in a wide variety of formats, and
support for MP3 and other compression technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the launching wasn't always as smooth as
well-streamed video. Apple unveiled a beta version on April 19, the
work-in-progress release of a program that allows the company to
get plenty of time-saving bug reports and comments from unpaid
testers.
</P>
<P>
   As is the case with beta software, however, bugs and bombs were
not uncommon. Ric Ford's Macintouch page (www.macintouch.com) began
posting user feedback on the software a few months ago, and Apple
also maintains a lively message board and tech-tip exchange on its
site. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest bait for the beta testers was the
high-quality version of the ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom
Menace'' Web trailer, exclusively in the Quicktime 4 format. Apple
reports that 6.25 million copies of Quicktime 4.0 have been
downloaded since the beta version was made available. Users were
not shy about posting reports of system glitches they were enduring
after installing the beta version, including unexplained crashes
and problems that spread to other programs, causing some to believe
that maybe the Quicktime 4 beta version itself was a phantom
menace.
</P>
<P>
   The final release of Quicktime 4 came out on June 8. ``The good
thing was, we didn't find many bugs that would be considered
show-stoppers by any software company on the planet,'' said Frank
Casanova, the director of Quicktime product marketing. ``Of course,
software is never finished. It's done, but it's never finished.''

   &UR; New Automated Strategies to Detect and Defuse Viruses &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The widespread invasion last week by the file-devouring Explore
worm underscored the networked society's vulnerability to malicious
computer programs. But even as the computer underworld is devising
increasingly sophisticated attacks, two major antiviral software
companies _ Symantec, with its partners IBM and Intel, and Network
Associates _ will soon deploy new automated systems to aid in the
speedy detection, analysis and defusing of viruses.
</P>
<P>
   At present, antivirus software carries a database containing the
unique fingerprints of known viruses. The hard part, however, is to
recognize what might be a new disease altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The new technology being developed, part of broader automated
security programs, relies on a central computer that acts like a
digital petri dish. The idea, explained Wes Wasson, director of
security product marketing for Network Associates, is a computer
that simulates a virus' environment and responds like the human
immune system. In particular, the program watches for the telltale
sign of a virus, whether it replicates and spreads, and then
creates a digital fingerprint and designs an antidote.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the Symantec Antivirus Research Center in Santa
Monica, Calif., successfully tested the automated system on the
Melissa virus. ``It took it 40 minutes to find a cure,'' said the
company's chief antivirus researcher, Carey Nachenberg.
</P>
<P>
   But viruses are more easily detected than worms. The current
version of the Symantec system was not able to detect the Explore
worm, Nachenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The Network Associates version would recognize Explore as a
hostile program, but would not be able to design a cure, Wasson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Network Associates and Symantec servers will be available to
corporate clients later this year, and the Symantec version will be
available to home users as well.

   &UR; A Digital Recorder Offers Capacity in Hours, Not Minutes  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Digital recorders have at least one great advantage over
magnetic tape models: they have the ability to download your spoken
thoughts into a computer for automatic conversion into printed text
through voice recognition software. The drawback is that digital
recorders generally measure their capacity in minutes, not hours.
</P>
<P>
   Olympus has solved at least part of the problem with its new
$199 DS-150 model, which can capture up to 2 hours and 40 minutes
of conversation or dictation, about 20 minutes less than the
maximum recording time of a traditional microcassette recorder. For
text conversion, that time is cut approximately in half.
</P>
<P>
   The downloading feature, which uses either a computer's serial
or U.S.B. port, is vital. Unlike some other digital recorders,
including the previous model offered by Olympus, the digital flash
memory in which the DS-150 captures chatter cannot be exchanged for
a blank unit when full. But Dave Veilleux, director of business
development at Olympus America, said he expected that many ``road
warriors'' would buy the machine because it allowed them to dictate
memorandums while traveling and then use e-mail to send the results
back to their offices for transcription.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; Speeding Up Communication by Saving Strokes on a Keypad &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The new technology called T9 is not an ultra-high-speed
telecommunications line. It's software that promises to eliminate
the cumbersome and time-consuming chore of punching text messages
into a wireless device.
</P>
<P>
   The T9 system, developed by Tegic Communications, a start-up
company in Seattle, began as a technology for people with severe
physical disabilities. Eye movements were used to trigger the
desired cluster of letters. To minimize the work required, the
program interpreted the correct spelling from a variety of
possibilities. In the midst of the project, the company's founders
saw greater opportunity in the wireless handset market and shifted
their focus.
</P>
<P>
   T9 requires far fewer keystrokes than the traditional method.
Although each key can be interpreted in three ways _ G, H or I, for
instance _ the program scans all the possibilities to determine the
correct word. Tegic executives say T9 gets the correct word on the
first try 29 out of 30 times. There is also a version in Chinese
and Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to do messaging, short phrases, what you'd
theoretically like to do is look at the lettering on the phone and
just start typing away at the letters and have the system figure
out what the likely words are,'' Gerry Purdy, president and chief
executive of Mobile Insights, a market research company in Mountain
View, Calif. ``They've done quite a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Tegic says it has now licensed the T9 Text Input technology to
more than 16 wireless phone manufacturers worldwide. Don Davidge,
Tegic's vice president for marketing, said he believed that T9
would become one of the features cellular phone customers would ask
for when shopping for a phone.

   &UR; A Handheld Device That Packs More Features on One Screen &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Following Palm Computing's phenomenal success in popularizing
handheld devices, a small company is trying to attract one of the
few consumer groups that hasn't yet joined the cult.
</P>
<P>
   The FUGA eDiary is intended for those who might feel intimidated
by a Palm Pilot or Windows CE device. The eDiary's key feature is
its sleek user interface, which integrates different applications
for addresses, tasks, appointments and expenses into a single
screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone else does different programs for &QL;
</P>
<P>
   different purposes _ they don't mix and match,'' said FUGA's
president, Jay Goyal.
</P>
<P>
   The eDiary labels different types of items with tags. The
standard ones are appointments and to-do and expense lists, but
additional ones can be created. Numerical items, like expenses and
mileage, can be tallied by date or by category. The to-do list
comes with boxes to be checked off, and unfinished items
automatically roll over to the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The FUGA eDiary is available on the FUGA Web site at www.fuga &QL; 
.com or by phone at (877) FUGA-CORP, for $149.95. FUGA will soon
begin shipping the eDiary to stores.

ADVENTURE TURNS TO BOREDOM WHEN KID HAS TONSILS TAKEN OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday June 24)  
(rk) 
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger

<TEXT>
<P>
   Getting your tonsils out may be a childhood rite of passage, but
it's not much fun.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the chocolate pudding, popsicles and mashed potato diet.
</P>
<P>
   Despite getting to watch all the TV, play all the Nintendo and
read all the comics you want.
</P>
<P>
   Despite mom, dad and an assortment of baby sitters at your beck
and call.
</P>
<P>
   My 8-year-old son, in fact, is going just a wee bit STIR CRAZY
after a week of ``no outside play, no exertion and no scratchy
foods.'' And there's still another week to go.
</P>
<P>
   We waited until school was out for the surgery, which was
performed, reassuringly enough, by Dr. Good, a cheerful ear, nose
and throat specialist who wore colorful cartoon ties.
</P>
<P>
   The day before surgery, we got the pre-op instructions: no food
past midnight, nothing to drink past 6 a.m. I woke Adam just before
dawn to give him a large glass of Gatorade.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving our 2-year-old with her grandparents, we headed
for the hospital, videos, extra clothes and a 3-foot-long stuffed
monitor lizard in tow.
</P>
<P>
   One stuffed animal was allowed to accompany Adam into surgery.
The lizard was a good choice: not a ``baby toy'' like his teddy
bear, but a ferocious looking guard to stand watch.
</P>
<P>
   Adam, clad in just a cotton gown and tube socks, seemed more
excited than scared, especially after they gave him his ``silly
medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   But the night before, as I sat beside him on his bed, he had let
the first sign of anxiety slip out. ``You know what they do at a
hospital when a kid dies?'' he said. ``They gather all the moms
together in an auditorium and read the name on the hospital
bracelet out loud.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiled up at me, knowing that this isn't what happens at all,
and that he would be just fine, but needing to hear me say it all
the same.
</P>
<P>
   As Jim and I sat in our little post-op cubicle, though, waiting
for our son to be wheeled back in, I half expected the crackling
voice on the speaker to say, ``Would all moms please report to the
auditorium for a tragic announcement?''
</P>
<P>
   In just under an hour, our son's gurney was being wheeled back
down the hall, lizard-tail first.
</P>
<P>
   When he surfaced from the anesthesia a few minutes later,
coughing and sputtering, Adam wasn't happy. The doctors and nurses
had warned us about this first, rough period, where it starts to
dawn on kids that this isn't a big adventure but something that
hurts pretty bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``My throat feels horrible,'' he moaned, tossing on the bed and
tangling his IV line.
</P>
<P>
   The next hour was a blur of pain meds, slushies, Sprite, crying
and a few excruciating minutes of throwing up.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he calmed down enough to watch one of the videos on the
TV above the bed. After dozing on and off, and keeping some fluids
down, he was cleared to go home about six hours after we had
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a week later, the hardest part for Adam is driving by the
neighborhood pool and seeing all his friends jumping in while he
sits with a book in the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   He's waiting impatiently, two tonsils lighter, for the green
light.

ON BLOOMSDAY, IRISH REJOICE IN `RE-JOYCING'  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ Today is Bloomsday, so thousands stalked the spirit of
Leopold Bloom, the newspaper advertising salesman, the hungry
relisher of innards of beasts and fowls, the cuckold, and the
Jewish outsider who is the hero of James Joyce's enormous novel,
``Ulysses.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the people who imitated Bloom by eating Gorgonzola cheese
sandwiches at Davey Byrne's pub and bought bars of lemon soap at
Sweny's chemist shop, and climbed to the parapet of the stone tower
where the novel opens, was David Norris.
</P>
<P>
   Norris, like Bloom, is himself something of an outsider to the
culture of this overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country. Norris, 55,
is a Church of Ireland Protestant, a homosexual, a senator in the
national legislature, where he has championed gay rights for 12
years. He is also Ireland's most prominent Joycean, giving dozens
of lectures and theatrical readings annually here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Joyce chose to make his hero a Jew because that also
made him an outsider in Irish society, Norris said in an interview
that ``Bloom was an outsider, but he was an insider to readers
because his mind flows in the same way as ours do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an outsider,'' he added, ``but I'm also an insider
because now people appreciate that I have so many things in common
with them. I have a sense of humor. I perform. I make people
laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that ``Ulysses'' puzzles and intimidates many
readers and that most people in Ireland have not read the novel,
which was published in 1922. They know that it was once banned as
pornographic, and that it is a very difficult read. He said such
daunted would-be readers could overcome the kind of guilt Joyce
described in ``Ulysses'' as ``agenbite of inwit: remorse of
conscience,'' and begin to understand and enjoy the book.
</P>
<P>
   The trick to taming ``Ulysses,'' Norris said, is to skip the
many difficult or impenetrable passages, and keep reading the
narrative sections that are full of psychological drama, hopes,
fears, puns and jokes. It also helps, he said, to read the book
aloud, as poetry. That would be, in Joycean wordplay, to rejoice in
re-joycing.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom's relevance to contemporary Ireland, Norris said, is
simple: love, not hatred. In the novel, baited by a jingoist Irish
Republican in a pub, Bloom says, ``That's not life for men and
women, insult and hatred,'' ``it's the very opposite,'' ``Love says
Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, Norris said, Bloom's words applied to the sectarian
violence in Northern Ireland today. ``Instead of bloodshed,''
Norris said, ``get on with lives of ordinary decency and
tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Today is Bloomsday because June 16 was the day in 1904 on which
the events in the novel take place. This afternoon at Sweny's
pharmacy on Lincoln Place, cakes of lemon soap, which had cost
Bloom fourpence in that shop in 1904, were selling quickly for
about $1.80. At Davey Byrne's pub on Duke Street, gorgonzola
sandwiches and a glass of Burgundy sold for about $10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had two fellas in from the country,'' said the bartender,
Thomas B. McDonagh. ``Terrible country accents. One of them read
from `Ulysses,' one from `Finnegans Wake.' Nobody knew what they
were talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   A relevant passage from a Joyce letter about ``Ulysses,'' Norris
said, might be, ``I've put in so many enigmas and puzzles that it
will keep the professors busy for centuries arguing over what I
mean, and that's the only way of insuring one's immortality.''

`GIRLS' GUIDE TO HUNTING AND FISHING:' SHE LIVES TO TELL ABOUT
GROWING UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the title story of Melissa Bank's charming, funny collection
of seven linked fictions, ``The Girls' Guide to Hunting and
Fishing,'' Jane Rosenal, the protagonist, has grown a little
desperate to find a permanent mate. On a shopping trip to
Loehmann's to buy a dress for a wedding Jane is to attend, a friend
mentions ``a terrible book'' she has been reading called ``How to
Meet and Marry Mr. Right,'' a ``guide to manipulation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like I've been trying to catch a fish by swimming around
with them,'' the friend explains. ``I keep making myself get in the
water again. I try different rivers. I change my strokes. But
nothing works. Then I find this guide that tells me about fishing
poles and bait, and how to cast and what to do when the line gets
taut. . . . The depressing part is that you  &UR; know &LR;  it'll work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate fish,'' Jane says.
</P>
<P>
   But at the wedding she meets and falls for Robert, who seems to
like her too. While nervously waiting for his call, she buys the
guide, reads it and applies its lessons. For a while they seem to
work, but then Robert begins to lose interest. When she throws the
book away and confronts him, he reveals that he loved her until she
began playing games. The guide has backfired. (I'm not giving too
much away here; the pleasure is in the details.)
</P>
<P>
   The story is a little O. Henryish perhaps, but it makes the
effective point that manipulation is only for the manipulative.
Besides, Jane is finally ready for love. As the title indicates,
Ms. Bank's entire book is a ``Girls' Guide to Hunting and
Fishing,'' and Jane has learned its lessons well.
</P>
<P>
   In the first story, ``Advanced Beginners,'' she is the
14-year-old younger sister of 20-year-old Henry, whose affair with
28-year-old Julia she deeply identifies with. When things don't
work out because Henry has trouble negotiating his way in Julia's
ultra-WASP world, Jane reports: ``It scared me to think that my
brother had failed at loving someone. I had no idea myself how to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Floating House,'' she is older and has a boyfriend,
Jamie. But when they visit St. Croix as the guests of Jamie's
ex-girlfriend, Bella, and her new husband, Yves, she discovers,
among other things, that marriage doesn't necessarily define the
boundaries of sex. When Jamie eventually apologizes for flirting
with Bella, Jane reports that ``it scares me how fast I go from
disliking to loving him, and I wonder if it's this way for
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   In two longer stories, ``My Old Man'' and ``The Worst Thing a
Suburban Girl Could Imagine,'' Jane recounts her long and complex
affair with an older man, Archie Knox, who, her great aunt, a
novelist, tells her, is ``more famous than an editor should be.''
Here Ms. Bank's witty tones turn more somber, as Jane loses her
father to leukemia, her job as a book editor to her unwillingness
to judge other people's writing and finally Archie himself because
of their inability to talk to each other.
</P>
<P>
   But she has grown up enough by now that in ``You Could Be
Anyone,'' when the perfect hunk stays with her through breast
cancer and proposes marriage to her by passing her the engagement
ring she knows he has bought and saying, ``I think I can do it
now,'' she sees herself ``through his eyes, as the Generic Woman,
the skirted symbol on the ladies' room door'' and says goodbye to
him. She is ready to meet Robert.
</P>
<P>
   She is also ready for something else.
</P>
<P>
   Jane's problem is that she is funny: ``funny is the best thing I
am,'' she says. ``Don't be funny!'' say the authors of ``How to
Meet and Marry Right.'' ``Funny is the opposite of sexy.'' ``Humor
isn't feminine.'' But even as a child Jane was always cracking wise
and feeling bad about it. Describing her brother and Julia, she
reports: ``They didn't kiss or hold hands in front of me, though
once, at lunch, Henry sort of rubbed my foot under the table,
thinking it was Julia's. I leaned over to him and whispered,
`You're really turning me on.' I was a teen-ager, after all, an
expert in the art of mortification.''
</P>
<P>
   This habit of hers only grows wittier. When she tells Archie
that she has lost her editing job and he snaps his fingers and says
she must come to work for him at his publishing house, she retorts,
``I could bring you up on charges for that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Work harassment in the sexual place.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, all the considerable humor of these stories turns on
Jane's wonderfully clear sense of the trickiness of language. (Of
Jamie's ex-girlfriend she reports, ``Her vowels and consonants are
all off _ trying to understand her is like picking fish out of the
clover and goats out of the ocean.'')
</P>
<P>
   And after Jane's father dies and her editing job begins to fail
her, it is language that helps her to survive and grow. She
explains: ``There's a passageway connecting Port Authority to Times
Square _ the Eighth Avenue subways to the Seventh _ and one morning
when I looked up I saw a poem in the eaves, sequential like the
Burma Shave billboards: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Overslept,
</P>
<P>
   so tired.
</P>
<P>
   If late,
</P>
<P>
   get fired.
</P>
<P>
   Why the worry?
</P>
<P>
   Why the pain?
</P>
<P>
   Go back home.
</P>
<P>
   Do it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something changed then. I saw my life in scale: it was just my
life. It was not momentous, and only now did I recognize that it
had once seemed so to me; that was while my father was watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw myself the way I'd seen the cleaning women in the
building across the street. I was just one person in one window.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody was watching, except me.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon she will quit her editing job and go to work in
advertising. Figuratively speaking, she will write her own book,
``The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing,'' in which she will
teach amusing lessons in how to stalk and find . . . yourself. &QL;

FAMILY FILES SUIT OVER WRESTLER'S FATAL FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE VENDEL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The harness that suspended Owen Hart was
unsafe and inadequate to hold the 230-pound professional wrestler
who fell to his death last month, a lawsuit filed Tuesday alleged.
</P>
<P>
   Hart's family named 13 defendants _ including the World
Wrestling Federation and the city of Kansas City _ in the
wrongful-death lawsuit, filed in Jackson County Circuit Court. The
lawsuit, which seeks an undetermined amount of money, stemmed from
the May 23 accident that killed Hart at Kemper Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Hart, 34, of Calgary, Alberta, was supposed to enter the ring
from a catwalk 78 feet above the ring. As he dangled in mid-air,
waiting for his cue, a quick-release mechanism on his vest opened
prematurely, dropping him to his death, said police who
investigated the accident.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleged that the stunt was dangerous and poorly
planned. In particular, the lawsuit alleged that the harness system
was defective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our legal and factual allegation is that Owen Hart died
because this makeshift contraption was totally inadequate for this
intended purpose,'' family attorney Gary Robb said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   He said the mechanism used to support Hart was intended to rig
sailboats.
</P>
<P>
   Robb said Hart could have moved his shoulder and triggered the
harness' quick-release mechanism on his vest. He said it took only
six pounds of pressure to trigger the mechanism. In comparison, it
takes eight pounds of pressure to pull the trigger of a Kansas City
police officer's handgun, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   The 118-page lawsuit lists 46 separate counts against the
defendants, who include the WWF; Vince McMahon, the WWF's chairman;
and the city, as owner of Kemper Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The city is covered by an insurance policy paid for by the WWF.
All arena lessees are required to buy liability insurance to
protect the city, said William LaMette, director of convention
centers. City officials declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Other defendants in the lawsuit include WWF's parent company,
Titan Sports, four companies that manufactured or sold the
harness-and-cable system and four riggers who set up the stunt.
Three riggers were on the catwalk with Hart before he fell. The
role of the fourth rigger was not clear.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the defendants contacted Tuesday were not aware that
they had been named in the lawsuit. Some declined to comment;
others did not return telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the lawsuit, police are investigating whether criminal
acts contributed to Hart's death. Their investigation is focused on
the appropriateness of the equipment used by Hart to see whether
anyone was criminally negligent.
</P>
<P>
   WWF Spokesman Jim Byrne said his company had not yet been served
with the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to respond to a lawsuit that hasn't been seen
yet,'' he said. ``The police investigation is still ongoing, so it
would seem the lawsuit is precipitous.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrne declined to discuss the equipment used by Hart. He said
Hart had performed the stunt a few times before.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit claimed precautions were missing, such as a safety
net, safety harness, backup cables or a safety lock on the release
mechanism. Owen Hart also was not properly trained, the lawsuit
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to Owen Hart was absolutely preventable,'' said
Pamela Fischer, a family attorney from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Hart's widow, Martha Hart;
their two children, ages 7 and 3; and Owen Hart's parents, all of
Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   Hart's widow, Martha Hart, said she decided to file the lawsuit
to hold accountable those responsible for her husband's death and
to protect other wrestlers from unsafe conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Professional wrestling has become a showy display of graphic
violence, sexual themes and ever more dangerous stunts,'' she said.
``The WWF has deliberately chosen to promote profit at the expense
of the most basic safety of its performers.''

 Students give time, attention to more deprived youngsters  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WINSTON ROSS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Daniel Clark understands that life in the
inner city is not easy.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty, he knows, presents the most talented and capable youth
with daunting challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel has faced those challenges, too. Even now, his room at
home is too small for a bed. But he managed to win a scholarship to
Rockhurst High School, and this week 10 of his classmates get to
see some of what he has experienced.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel and the 10 others are sleeping on church floors and
spending time with youngsters from the most deprived areas of
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The students are working at St. Louis Church on Swope Parkway as
part of a new program called the Total Ignatian Experience.
</P>
<P>
   School administrators at Rockhurst chose the students on the
basis of scholarship and overall achievement. They deliver food to
the church, study, play with and be mentors to children enrolled in
the church's youth program, Upper Room. They also serve dinner at
soup kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel sees the week as a chance to give something back to the
community. He wants to show his younger peers that success is
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these kids are very intelligent,'' he said. ``I've
seen both sides, and I realize these kids can do it. They don't
realize that sometimes it's not their fault.''
</P>
<P>
   What is challenging for the other Rockhurst students is to be
plunged into an environment that, for most of them, is completely
foreign. .MDNM/They don't know what it's like to worry about their
next meals or how long they will have a roof over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Rockhurst's Aaron Clevinger said listening to inner-city
residents' stories of hardship made him think twice about his own
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're comfortable, you start taking things for
granted,'' he said. ``I thought, coming in, you could do anything
you wanted as long as you're motivated to do it. Here, there's so
much against them.''
</P>
<P>
   The week is part academia, part hard labor, and all fun, said
the students. And the children enjoy working with their older
mentors.
</P>
<P>
   Rockhurst teacher Peg Mulvihill is coordinating the volunteer
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're being `men for others' '' she said. ``This gives them
the chance to have a different outlook.''

COOL IDEAS WITH ICE CREAM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ANN CRISWELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Cool off your summer with ice cream, sherbet, sorbet,
ices, granita, frozen yogurt or gelato. With so many new choices,
you could have a different frozen treat every day this summer
without repeating.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, more than 261 packaged ice cream and related products
and 98 frozen novelties were introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of light, reduced- and low-fat products declined slightly
in recent years. To confirm the trend toward indulgence, premium
and superpremium ice creams are outselling regular and economy
brands. Another trend is co-branding. New ice cream products are
increasingly using ingredients from well-known candy, cookie, fruit
and flavoring manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The fastest growing flavors in 1998 were caramel, liquor
flavors, peach and coffee/mocha. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The top flavors of ice cream (based on supermarket sales) are
vanilla (29.2 percent), nut (10.7 percent), chocolate (9.8
percent), fruit (8.8 percent), Neapolitan (8.1 percent) and candy
mix-in (5 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Puzzled about what the labels on ice cream really mean? Here are
some label terms you'll see in the supermarket. (Note: In the
following list, overrun refers to the amount of aeration the ice
cream undergoes during manufacture, which keeps it from becoming an
inedible frozen mass.)
</P>
<P>
   -- Ice cream: A frozen food made from a mixture of dairy
products; contains at least 10 percent milk fat.
</P>
<P>
   -- Light ice cream: Contains at least 50 percent less total fat
or 33 percent fewer calories than the referenced product (the
average of leading regional or national brands).
</P>
<P>
   -- Reduced-fat ice cream: Contains at least 25 percent less
total fat than the referenced product (either the average of
leading brands or the company's own brand).
</P>
<P>
   -- Low-fat ice cream: Contains a maximum of 3 grams total fat
per {-cup serving.
</P>
<P>
   -- Superpremium ice cream: Tends to have very low overrun,
higher fat content and uses the best quality ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   -- Premium ice cream: Tends to have low overrun, higher fat
content than regular ice cream and uses higher quality ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   -- Regular ice cream: Meets the overrun required for the ice
cream standard.
</P>
<P>
   -- Economy ice cream: Meets the required overrun and generally
sells for a lower price than regular ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   -- Sherbet: Generally an ice in which milk replaces some of the
juice, water or cream. Unflavored gelatin frequently is added to
improve texture. Sorbet is the French word for sherbet; sorbetto,
the Italian word.
</P>
<P>
   -- Sorbets: Light, refreshing ices made with fruit juice and/or
pured fruit but no milk, cream or eggs. Best eaten immediately
after they are frozen. Sorbetti are classic Italian ices. They are
generally made with more fruit juice and less water and remain soft
even after freezing.
</P>
<P>
   -- Ices: Made of pured fruits and/or juices and resemble
sorbets. They must be stirred while freezing or processed in a food
processor for proper texture.
</P>
<P>
   When ice cream is exposed to a temperature of about 10 degrees
Fahrenheit, it may experience changes in body, texture and flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some storing and handling tips to keep it in prime
condition.
</P>
<P>
   -- Make the ice cream aisle your last stop in the supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   -- Watch the temperature of the grocery freezer case. It should
be no warmer than minus 20 degrees. Kept at the proper temperature,
ice cream will be thoroughly frozen and feel hard to the touch. If
the product is soft, you may wish to alert the manager.
</P>
<P>
   -- In an open-top freezer case, always select ice cream and
frozen treats stored below the freezer line.
</P>
<P>
   -- Put ice cream products in the separate basket of your grocery
cart or on top of other groceries.
</P>
<P>
   -- Insulate ice cream for the ride home. When groceries are
packed, ask for a freezer bag or extra brown paper bag to insulate
ice cream. Or take a cooler with you to the store and pack ice
cream in that.
</P>
<P>
   -- Make the grocery store or ice cream parlor your last stop
before going home. Don't let ice cream sit in a warm car while you
make other stops.
</P>
<P>
   -- Never allow ice cream to repeatedly soften and refreeze at
home because ice crystals can turn into large, unpalatable lumps.
</P>
<P>
   -- Store ice cream between minus 5 degrees and 0 degrees. It
will be firm enough to hold its shape, but easy to dip between 6
and 10 degrees, the ideal serving temperature range.
</P>
<P>
   -- Store ice cream in the main part of the freezer, not in the
door.
</P>
<P>
   -- Keep lid tightly closed when storing ice cream in the
freezer.
</P>
<P>
   -- Store ice cream away from uncovered foods in the freezer to
prevent odor absorption.
</P>

   KOSOVO-MAIN _ MORINI, Albania _ Thousands of Kosovar Albanian
refugees, despite NATO warnings about landmines and boobie trapped
houses, are crossing the border here to return to their homes in
Kosovo. The Yugoslav withdrawal from the zone extending from
Pristina to the southern border was largely completed by its
midnight deadline, except for isolated cases of soldiers in
broken-down vehicles. NATO gave the Serbs anouther 24 hours.
Meanwhile, U.S. and Russian foreign and defense ministers meet in
Helsinki to hammer out Russia's role in Kosovo peacekeeping.

   KOSOVO-MASSACRE _ KORENICA, Yugoslavia _ It is likely the worst
massacre of the Serb ethnic cleansing campaign. Mark Barishe died
because he couldn't drive a tractor. Vengeful Serb troops were
going to let the 68-year-old man get away. But when he told them
that he couldn't drive a tractor, they took him back into his house
with five others, lined them up against the bedroom wall. ``Aren't
you people too,'' he pleaded. But when the Catholic Albanian began
to cross his heart, a Serb soldier said, ``It's too late for you
now.'' And now five charred bodies mark the most gruesome scene
from a rampage in which up to 300 Kosovar Albanians were massacred
to avenge the death of five Serb policemen. (Kaplow, Atlanta

homeland as many are Tuesday, Emini lies under a mound of dirt on a

   HITCHED _ Alabama's chain gangs are gone. But prison hitching
posts _ which trace their history to pillors and stockades _ may be
back. They're not used anywhere else in the country. Endorsed by
Gov. Don Siegelman, Alabama prison commissioner Mike Haley argued
in federal court this week to reinstate the practice of shackling
inmates who refused to work to hitching posts, horizontal metal
bars placed at 50 inches and 45 inches above the ground, to
accommodate inmates of different heights. Today in a conference
call with U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson, attorneys from the
Southern Poverty Law Center, representing five inmates, and the
state corrections department will discuss remaining legal
arguments. While Thompson contemplates his decision, the hitching
posts remain unused. Alabama has had a checked past with its
prisons. Feds took over the system in 1979 after prisoner abuse.

legal brief, which lies this morning on a table under lamplight at
the Palm Beach Historical Society. It is the voice of Judge C.E.
Chillingworth, abducted with his wife 44 years ago, June 15, 1955,
from a seaside bungalow in Manalapan. The judge, 58, and his wife,
Marjorie, 47, were bound, weighted and forced overboard, alive, two
miles out to sea, by two assassins hired by a fellow judge who
hated and feared Chillingworth. (Browning, Palm Beach Post) 54

   BLACK-SEMINOLES _ AUSTIN, Texas _ It was an archaeological
project in a South Texas town that led University of Texas
anthropologist Shirley Mock to a little-known community. A golf
course and houses were being planned in a section of Brackettville,
but before construction could start, the land had to be excavated
excavation for any culturally significant items. Ajd as part of the
project, Mock was hired to interview the older people who lived
near the site. Those initial talks led to more in-depth
ethnological interviews and years of research into the black
Seminoles of Texas and Mexico. ``Singing to the Ancestors: Black
Seminoles on the Border'' is the culmination of Mock's five-year
scholarly investigation. The multimedia exhibit explores the search
for freedom and the building of a culture among a group that formed
in the early 1800s, when runaway slaves took shelter with the
Seminole Indians in Florida. (Martin, Austin American-Statesman)

MBEKI SEATED AS SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRETORIA _ With cannon blasts and the soaring voices of
children, South Africa inaugurated Thabo Mbeki as its second black
president Wednesday, ushering in a new era and bidding farewell to
a generation that battled racial oppression to emancipate the
masses.
</P>
<P>
   After taking the oath of office in five of South Africa's 11
official languages, Mbeki paid tribute to the elders of the
antiapartheid movement, including outgoing President Nelson
Mandela, Oliver Tambo, Walter Sisulu, and his own father, Govan
Mbeki. Then, acknowledging that the burden falls to his generation
to make good on the promises of liberation, he vowed to tackle the
country's pervasive social problems: soaring unemployment, abject
poverty, violent crime, and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our days and our nights will remain forever blemished as long
as our people are torn apart and fractured into contending factions
by reason of the racial and gender inequalities, which continue to
characterize our society,'' he said. ``The full meaning of
liberation will not be realized until our people are freed both
from oppression and from the dehumanizing legacy of deprivation we
inherited from our past.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 4,000 guests and dignitaries nestled in the sandstone
amphitheater of Pretoria's Union Buildings, and at least 50,000
South Africans gathered at the bottom of the capital's terraced
gardens to watch the ceremony on huge video screens.
</P>
<P>
   Great cheers rang out at the arrivals of two unlikely heroes:
Libya's Muammar Khadafy, who was making his first trip abroad since
the lifting of UN sanctions, and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mbeki, who spent most of his adult life in exile, has
been carefully groomed over the past five years as Mandela's
deputy, the proceedings marked a rare moment in Africa when a
sitting president willingly and peacefully yielded power to a
democratically elected successor.
</P>
<P>
   Punctuated by low-altitude military fly-overs, the event
underscored the extent to which South Africa has changed and
emerged since the end of white rule five years ago. The nation's
top generals, on hand to demonstrate their loyalty to civilian
rule, are now black. Some 30 African leaders, whose countries
warred against the apartheid state, swelled the visitors' ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki's inauguration took place on the 23rd anniversary of the
youth uprisings in Soweto, when security police opened fire on
protesting students in the sprawling townships south of
Johannesburg. Nine children were killed that day, and hundreds of
lives were lost in ensuing protests.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the crowds gathered at a People's Concert below the
Union Buildings afterwards, Mbeki said, ``It is right and proper
that this ceremony should have taken place on June 16 because
without the struggle and sacrifices of our youth it is possible
that we would not be standing here today.''
</P>
<P>
   In a last and emotional symbolic gesture as president, Mandela
laid a wreath at Hector Peterson Square, the memorial to the slain
students, before arriving in Pretoria. Mandela, whose 27 years in
prison epitomized the sacrifices of his generation, now hopes to
retire into private life surrounded by his many grandchildren. He
made no farewell remarks Wednesday, and is expected to depart
Thursday with his wife, Graca Machel, for a holiday at an
undisclosed location.
</P>
<P>
   If Mandela's exit from the nation's public stage drew sighs of
nostalgia, those gathered to witness the transition hinted that
Mbeki's honeymoon will be short. The ruling African National
Congress won a resounding victory in the June 2 elections, securing
virtually uncontestable majorities in parliament and seven of the
nine provinces. Having returned the ANC to power, the masses now
want faster change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about Mandela's presidency was that he never
showed animosity,'' said Helmsley Thakela, one of thousands
gathered for the postinaugural concert. ``Now we must see Thabo
Mbeki achieve. When he says he will eradicate poverty, I trust he
will be able to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking to Mbeki,'' said David Mafifi, 24, who is
unemployed. ``He must create jobs and stimulate investment. Nobody
is working.'' South Africa's jobless rate hovers near 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki is expected to announce his Cabinet Thursday, including
the appointment of Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi as deputy
president. There was speculation that he would also hold talks with
visiting African leaders to reach an end to the 10-month multistate
war in Congo, but spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said no meeting had been
scheduled.

<P>
   The result: Alsace is one of the driest regions in France.
</P>
<P>
   Alsace, of course, is that thin strip of real estate fought over
and claimed many times by both France and Germany. The architecture
in the quaint villages is noticeably German, as are many of the
village names (such as Kaysersberg and Riquevihr), but the cuisine
is definitely French _ albeit often with a German twist.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, it was in Alsace that the sculptor who designed
the Statue of Liberty, Auguste Bartholdi, was born. And also Albert
Schweitzer. America's most decorated hero of World War II, Texas'
own Audie Murphy, won the Medal of Honor for heroism in a battle
near the Alsatian town of Colmar.
</P>
<P>
   Alsace's dry climate makes for wines that are less sweet than
those of their German cousins, which are more often ``off-dry'' to
downright sweet. Alsatian wines are dry. The common saying in
Alsace is that it's on the ``dry side of the Rhine.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless an Alsatian wine says Vendange Tardive or Selection des
Grains Nobles (these are late-harvest, naturally sweet wines), the
wines will be bracingly dry and acidic, yet with fine-tuned, often
piercing fruit flavors.
</P>
<P>
   And they go wonderfully with food. That may account for the fact
that Alsace has more Michelin three-star restaurants than any other
region in France. Alsace is both an oenophile's and a gastronome's
paradise.
</P>
<P>
   The company of Alsace Willm dates to 1896. In the early 1930s,
Willm (pronounced Vilm) was the first Alsatian producer to export
to the United States. Willm makes a string of wines, from pinot
blanc to gewrztraminer to a lightly sparkling wine called crmant.
The wines are not as showy as some nor as heavy-handed as others,
and they offer good value.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what's available:
</P>
<P>
   Alsace Willm Crmant d'Alsace _ 41/2 stars_ a blend of pinot
blanc and a dollop of chardonnay, this lightly sparkling wine has a
creamy quality and is an excellent aperitif. At $11.99-$12.59, it
is quite a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Another bargain is the 1998 Alsace Willm Pinot Blanc _ 4 stars
be great with baked fish or chicken. A steal at $7.99-$8.99.
</P>
<P>
   There are few producers of an Alsatian white-wine blend called
Gentil, the best-known being Hugel. One reason so few do it may be
that by blending such distinctive flavors as riesling, pinot blanc,
pinot gris, sylvaner and muscat, you end up with a nondistinctive
wine. That's the case with the 1997 Alsace Willm Gentil _ 3 stars _
a thoroughly pleasant wine but one without any (literally)
outstanding characteristics. The price is right, though:
$6.99-$7.99.
</P>
<P>
   There's an attractive touch of butterscotch in the 1998 Alsace
Willm Pinot Gris _ 4 stars _ and the creamy aftertaste is nice,
too. About $8.99-$9.99.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the 1998 Alsace Willm Gewrztraminer _ 4 stars _ has
just the right ``weight,'' neither too wimpy (like many New World
versions), nor ponderous (like several other neighbors' versions,
e.g. Pierre Sparr). It does have a good dose of that spicy, Gewrz
character. About $11.99.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line on Alsace Willm: good wines that may be underpriced.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Because of a fickle climate, widely varying soils and, frankly,
inconsistent winemaking, making sense of Burgundies requires the
concentration of walking through a minefield. Consistency is hard
to find.
</P>
<P>
   There is only a handful of large producers that you can count on
to produce stylistically consistent wines. These are such
well-known firms as Louis Latour and Louis Jadot.
</P>
<P>
   And Joseph Drouhin.
</P>
<P>
   I tasted a skein of 1998 Drouhin white Burgundies and 1997
Drouhin red Burgundies recently, and although the individual wines
did their individual thing, it was the overall picture that was
most important at the moment. Because of Drouhin's consistency, it
was easy to get a picture of the vintages, and vintages are very
important in Burgundy.
</P>
<P>
   The firm of Joseph Drouhin dates to 1880, and today is a leading
producer, making wines from around 80 appellations. The line is
best-known for three white wines: Beaune Clos de Mouches and
Chassage-Montrachet and Le Montrachet from the Marquis de Laguiche.
The reds don't get the press the whites do, perhaps unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   After tasting the 1998 Drouhin white Burgundies, here are some
impressions:
</P>
<P>
   The '98 whites were uneven. Some, such as the underrated
Montagny, showed very well. So did the underpriced Rully, always a
good value in white Burgundy. Others, such as the Meursault and
Puligny-Montrachet, seemed shy. Perhaps all they need is a little
bottle age. The Chassagne-Montrachet, with its lime-citrus quality,
was very attractive, while its more celebrated sibling, the
Chassagne-Montrachet Marquis de Laguiche, was not as forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, not available for tasting was the white Beaune Clos de
Mouches.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line on the whites: Choose carefully. The more expensive
wines will need cellaring.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 reds were fairly simple and straightforward, showing
some suppleness and _ most important _ they're already easy to
drink. Especially when compared with the more substantial,
longer-aging '96s.
</P>
<P>
   Among the less expensive '97 Drouhin red Burgundies, the Cote de
Beaune and the Cotes de Beaune Villages were drinking quite well,
with good smoky plum flavors. The Santenay, usually a personal
favorite, was OK but lacked charm.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not a fan of Pommard, but the '97 Drouhin was most
attractive, although it may need a year or two to flesh out. The
red Beaune Clos de Mouches doesn't have the reputation of the white
version, and the '97 was no exception. I liked the pieces _ the
bouquet, the Bing cherry-bacon nuances _ but right now it's a bit
disjointed. Maybe in a couple of years ...
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever seen the descriptor ``cinnamon'' used for a red
Burgundy, take a whiff of the '97 Drouhin Chambolle-Musigny. Now
that's cinnamon. Supple and easy to drink, this is one nice wine
for the short term.
</P>
<P>
   The Gevrey-Chambertin, though, lacked sex appeal, always a major
component of red Burgundy. Give it a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   And the Clos de Vougeot had a nice spicy quality, but it's a
fairly big wine that needs to stretch its legs for a couple more
years.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line on the '97 Drouhin red Burgundies: Many are
drinking well already, making them good candidates for restaurant
wine lists while the harder, bigger '96s mature.
</P>
<P>
   All the '97 Drouhin red Burgundies and '98 white Burgundies will
arrive here in the fall.

IN THE OLYMPICS OF THE ART WORLD, ANYTHING FOR AN EDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BASEL, Switzerland _ Even among the most unassuming art
collectors, trying to look like a gallery worker is generally not a
goal.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, this is mid-June in Basel, home of the world's
biggest and best 20th-century art fair. Some collectors really want
to get a jump on their rivals. So on Monday, 24 hours before Art
Basel opened to invited collectors and 48 hours before it opened to
the public Wednesday, the very well-connected dressed down,
borrowed worker's passes from friendly dealers and slipped past
security guards into the huge Messe Basel Exhibition Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The dealers were still setting up their booths, but that did not
stop determined collectors like Eileen Cohen, Jose Mugrabi and
Michael Hort, all New Yorkers, and Dennis and Deborah Scholl of
Miami, and curators like Paul Schimmel of the Museum of
Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, from looking and buying.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot to see. With 260 dealers from around the world,
Art Basel is daunting. It shines with masterworks by artists from
Picasso and Polke to Johns and Richter as well as works by hundreds
of newer artists like John Currin and Rosemarie Trockel, Germany's
representative in this year's Venice Biennale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an art extravaganza,'' said Thea Westreich, a New
York-based art adviser who settled in over the weekend with a staff
of four to work with a half-dozen or so of her clients who are
here. ``It's a very full sampling of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, dealers save their very best works to show here because
the exhibition hall is awash in serious buyers. They are an
international group _ mostly European, but with large contingents
from the United States and others from Japan, Australia and Latin
America. The fair also draws hundreds of museum curators. This year
the Dallas Museum of Art, the St. Louis Art Museum, and both the
Museum of Modern Art and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New
York, are among those shepherding their patrons across the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Those who arrive late often regret it. Norman and Norah Stone of
San Francisco arrived in Basel around 1 p.m. Tuesday and went
straight to the fair, two hours after several thousand invited
collectors were admitted. They went straight to the booth of Thomas
Amman Fine Art of Zurich to purchase an Andy Warhol hammer and
sickle painting they had heard about. Their first choice, a red
one, was long gone and so was the white one that was their second
choice. ``We found out our friends from San Francisco, Kent and
Vicki Logan, beat us to the Warhol,'' Mrs. Stone said. ``We will
always come in on Mondays from now on.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some artists who normally shun the commerciality of art
fairs come to Basel. Robert Rauschenberg, Daniel Buren, Rebecca
Horn and Vanessa Beecroft are a few of those expected this week.
Miss Trockel was here Monday, as was Katharina Fritsch, a German
artist who was setting up her own work at the booth of the New York
dealer Matthew Marks. ``She said that a lot of young artists come
here to see art and she wanted it to look right,'' Schimmel said.
</P>
<P>
   By the fair's end Monday, the crowd is expected to exceed last
year's total of 51,000, threatening to overwhelm Basel's 200,000
residents as they take over the town's streets, restaurants and 30
museums. No matter. This is Art Basel's 30th anniversary, and the
town has been invited to some festivities. Saturday night, several
theaters, discos, museums and other cultural institutions in the
town center will offer free special events and remain open until at
least midnight in celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers have to compete for the 260 spots at Art Basel. This
year, more than 800 galleries, including virtually all of last
year's participants, applied, up from about 700 last year. ``Four
hundred to 500 of them are galleries that would have a place at any
good international art fair without question,'' said fair manager
Lorenzo Rudolf. ``The problem,'' he added with a smile, ``is the
space we have available, and we will not enlarge it.''
</P>
<P>
   A committee of four dealers _ Pierre Hubert of Art &AMP; Public
Gallery of Geneva; Victor Gisler of Mai 36 Galerie of Zurich,
Gianfranco Verna of Galerie Verna of Zurich; and Wolfgang Guenther
of Galerie Limmer of Cologne _ reviewed dealers' plans and selected
the winners in a four-day session last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Participants from previous years usually make the cut unless
they failed to show high-quality art. New applicants work hard on
their proposals to prove they should be chosen. In the past, Art
Basel aimed to include about 25 new galleries each year. This time,
it decided to admit 50 newcomers. ``The public wants new stuff, and
we have to remain fresh,'' Rudolf said.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibiting at Basel is expensive _ total costs run to $60,000 or
more, which is double or triple what it takes to show at other
contemporary art shows. But dealers like Andrea Rosen, a New York
dealer who is now in her third year with a full-scale booth, say
they have made a profit even in their first year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only fair that I do,'' said Ms. Rosen. ``At Basel,
it's the best collectors in the world, the people you dream about
selling to, the people who are really knowledgeable.''
</P>
<P>
   This year some well-established, highly respected New York
galleries are in Basel for the first time _ like Barbara Gladstone,
Mitchell-Innes and Nash, David Zwirner and Luhring Augustine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done other European fairs but they never had the
international reach that Basel has,'' said Laurence Luhring, who
started his gallery with Roland Augustine 15 years ago and was
showing paintings by Christopher Wool, Martin Kippenberger and a
new sculpture by Rachel Whiteread.
</P>
<P>
   For collectors, Art Basel offers a rare opportunity to compare
inventory and prices. ``The key is to be able to assess the works
that are new to the market that dealers save up for Basel,'' said
Ms. Westreich.
</P>
<P>
   Besides offering an array of works by modern masters, the Basel
fair devotes an entire floor to cutting-edge dealers. And it
includes a special section called ``Art Statement'' that presents
one-person shows by young artists. There are areas set aside for
photography, outsize sculptures and video and film art as well.
</P>
<P>
   Curators and collectors can thus assess creative trends and
identify the rising stars. With the number of artists represented
here now well over 1,000, that is getting harder and harder. But
curators were talking about the ``new painting'' trend of the '90s,
a synthesis of 60's styles like Color Field abstraction, geometric
abstraction and Op Art into something fresh _ painters like Kevin
Appel, Monique Prieto and Laura Owens.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ms. Owens and Matthew Ritchie, both young American
painters, were honored by the Baloise Insurance Group, a Swiss
company, which this year inaugurated an annual award of $16,320 to
two artists. In addition, the company will buy a work by each
artist and donate them to a European museum.
</P>
<P>
   As the week wears on, once collectors have wandered through all
the exhibits and made their purchases, Basel becomes more and more
social. Big dealers like Anthony D'Offay of London and New York
hold dinner parties and visitors flood museums like the Beyeler
Foundation, which this year is showing ``Face to Face: Human Images
from Cezanne to Cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, this town on the Rhine will be cleared out and back
to normal.

CABLE AND WIRELESS PREPARES FOR FUTURE WITH INTERNATIONAL DIGITAL
IN FOLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Having just beat the hometown favorite in a hostile
takeover battle for the International Digital Corp., Cable and
Wireless PLC, the British telecommunications company that is fast
galloping across the globe, must now prove the battle was worth the
cost.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Cable and Wireless, which won a bidding war that
pitted it against Japan's giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
Corp., must quickly gain access to domestic telephone lines, either
through the purchase of or alliance with a domestic telephone
business, if it wants to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen R. Pettit, the head of the Cable and Wireless' global
business operations, reiterated at a news conference Wednesday that
the company had been in talks with some local carriers, although he
did not specify which ones. Press reports here say that the company
has approached the DDI Corp. and Tokyo Telecommunication Network,
but those reports have been vehemently denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be looking for alliances or interconnection
relationships,'' Pettit said.
</P>
<P>
   Without such a link, Cable and Wireless faces high access
charges, which will make it difficult for the company to make good
on its promises to offer the best-quality service at the lowest
cost.
</P>
<P>
   Cable and Wireless IDC, as the company will be known, intends to
focus on building its business in Japan with large corporate
customers interested in services for things like automated teller
machines and data and voice-over services. It will also concentrate
on other telecommunications and Internet service providers looking
for the most cost-efficient commodity services.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, International Digital's traffic is largely generated
by individuals, and only a small portion of its business is in data
transmission, according to Kate Lye, a telecommunications analyst
at Warburg Dillon Read in Tokyo. ``The IDC business is largely
telephone revenues, which will come under heavy pricing pressure,''
she said. ``They'll need to diversify away from the dependence on
voice traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   Cable and Wireless won the support of all but seven of
International Digital's 141 shareholders, garnering a 97.69 percent
stake for roughly $460 million at current exchange rates, plus the
assumption of $262 million in debt. The company declined to
identify the holdouts, but people close to the situation said that
Fujitsu Ltd., which holds roughly 1.6 percent of International
Digital, and some newspaper companies did not tender their shares.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Cable and Wireless has paid a hefty price, and its
executives have complained that Itochu Corp., a large trading
company whose 17.7 percent stake in International Digital made it
pivotal in the deal, drove a hard bargain.
</P>
<P>
   There are fears that former shareholders of International
Digital like Itochu and Toyota Motor Corp., which were also its
customers, might take their business elsewhere now that they have
no stake in the company.
</P>
<P>
   But Pettit said Cable and Wireless IDC would offer them such
high-quality, cost-competitive services that they couldn't afford
to jump ship. ``No emotion comes into that at the end of the day,''
he said.

LAWMAKERS PUSH FOR LEGISLATION TO REDUCE ACID RAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ New York lawmakers urged Congress Wednesday to pass
legislation aimed at reducing acid rain, saying it remains a threat
to trees and lakes throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very thing that forests and rivers need to survive _ rain
_ is killing them,'' Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said at a news
conference in front of the U.S. Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., introduced a
bill that would cut the airborne pollutants _ sulfur dioxide and
nitrogen dioxide _ that cause acid rain. However, he found little
support in Congress because some members said the problem affected
only the Northeast and others insisted the government had done
enough to address the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent federal report found that despite cuts in air
pollution, acid rain is a growing threat to forests and watersheds
in California, Colorado's Front Range, parts of the Southwest and
the southern Appalachians as well as remaining a serious problem in
the Adirondacks in northeastern New York.
</P>
<P>
   The report, issued in April, has helped build support for
Moynihan's bill by showing the problem is more than a regional
issue.
</P>
<P>
   So far eight senators, including California Democrats Barbara
Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, have co-sponsored the acid rain bill.
In the House, a similar bill introduced by Rep. Sherwood Boehlert,
R-N.Y., has 39 co-sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the fact that Canada and Mexico as well as European
nations have been damaged by acid rain, Boehlert said at the news
conference that the problem is ``not simply an Adirondacks issue or
a Northeast issue or even a national issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John E. Sweeney, R-N.Y., called acid rain a ``cancer''
eating away at the country's forests and lakes.
</P>
<P>
   The federal report, which was produced by the National Acidic
Precipitation Assessment Program, a consortium of government
agencies, found that:
</P>
<P>
   _ The San Gabriel Mountains and San Bernardino Mountains in
southern California, the high-elevation forests in the Colorado
Front Range, the Allegheny Mountains in West Virginia and the Great
Smoky Mountains in Tennessee are saturated or close to saturated
with nitrogen.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Chesapeake Bay is suffering from excess nitrogen, some of
it air pollution, which is causing algae blooms that suffocate
other life forms.
</P>
<P>
   _ High-elevation lakes and streams in the Sierra Nevada, the
Cascade Range and the Rocky Mountains may be on the verge of
suffering chronically high acidity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Many waterways in the Adirondacks are becoming more acidic
even as sulfur deposits decline. The report cites Environmental
Protection Agency projections that by 2040, about half the region's
2,800 lakes and ponds will be too acidic to sustain much life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The range of the problem is shocking,'' Moynihan said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   His bill would require industry, by 2005, to make an additional
50 percent cut in sulfur dioxide emissions and an extra 70 percent
cut in nitrogen dioxide emissions above those required under the
current clean air law.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the legislation, including utility companies, have
argued that existing laws are having an impact and just need more
time to work. The opponents have noted that industry is well ahead
of schedule in reducing its sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide
emissions. In addition, the reductions have cost industry only a
fraction of what many experts had predicted when the current law
went into effect in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Acid rain occurs when sulfur or nitrogen, which drift eastward
on the prevailing winds, mix with moisture in the atmosphere to
form sulfuric or nitric acid and fall as rain, snow or fog. Dry
nitrogen and sulfur pollution also turn to acid when deposited in
waterways or mixed with moisture in the soil.
</P>
<P>
   Coal-burning power plants concentrated in the Ohio River Valley
are a major source of nitrogen and sulfur pollution.

   LE BOURGET, France _ Like two politicians, Lockheed Martin and
Boeing are trading jabs in their all-or-nothing campaign for the
military's 3,000-airplane Joint Strike Fighter contract. And the
gibes have added considerable entertainment at the industry's Paris
Air Show this week. Companies often don't like to discuss
competitors _ but not in this case. Boeing is crowing about being
under cost, a sly reference to Lockheed Martin's admission of a
cost overrun this year. Lockheed Martin, in turn, is whispering
about why Boeing needed to redesign the tail section of its JSF
entry. By DAN PILLER. Story has moved in ``f'' financial category. &QL;

I'll stack my fried chicken against yours any day. My Italian cream
cake will rock your world. My chicken salad? Suffice it to say that

sorry. But if it makes you feel any better, the Battle of San

MORE THAN SIGHT GAGS AND SUBVERSIVE SATIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For Release Sunday, June 20)  
 (af)  
 By JEFF MacGREGOR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Contrary to what the Hollywood tabloids and most community
college vocational counselors would have you believe, the career of
a media critic is not all glamorous beer and glitzy skittles.
Hundreds of squinty hours might be spent watching television so one
can grind a midweek column out of why nobody on television can
properly pronounce the words ``temperature'' or ``February''
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Months pass, wasted, trying to manhandle ``Geraldo'' and
``thong'' into a single sentence for your big cable-news-in-review
essay. Days go by trying to puzzle out the title of that TBS
network rattlesnake-horror movie called ``Silent Predators.''
Aren't rattlesnakes pretty noisy? Hence the name? Aren't they, in
fact, (italics)one of the only predators on the planet to provide a
clearly audible warning?(end italics) (And our nation's educators
wonder why those standardized test scores are so low.)
</P>
<P>
   P.S.: Don't forget that 2,500-word think piece deconstructing
the simian semiotics of ``The Chimp Channel.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a grumpy life, then, and dispiriting, even if most media
critics do get to work at home in boxer shorts. Tracking the
collapse of global civilization week in and week out as television
shimmies the limbo bar of popular culture just a little lower for
us all is a rough and unforgiving business.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for ``The Simpsons,'' I'd have thrown in the remote
long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since the passing of ``Seinfeld'' last year, ``The Simpsons'' is
left alone as the only laugh-out-loud show on television. It is the
antidote to what ails most of the medium, at once smart and
anarchic, subtle and raucous. After more than a decade it remains
colorful proof that ``excellence'' and ``television'' needn't be
concepts of mutual exclusion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brainchild of the cartoonist Matt Groening, ``The Simpsons''
first appeared as a crudely drawn short subject on ``The Tracey
Ullman Show.'' Buying time for Ms. Ullman to run offstage and don
yet another rubber nose was an inauspicious start perhaps, but in
the dozen years since then the show has evolved into the funniest,
most sophisticated comedy on television.
</P>
<P>
   Hamstrung early on by terrible UHF channel positions on the
young Fox network, ``The Simpsons'' still managed to become a
breakout hit. Even hidden on channel 47B it was unlike anything
else television had to offer at the time. Within a few years,
thanks to a rabid core audience and a generation of doting critics,
it had grown so explosively that its catch phrases (``Ay,
caramba!'') and its licensed merchandise (``Ay, caramba!'' coaster
caddies) were ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   Historically this should have been the time for the show to
collapse under the weight of its own complacency _ to hang on for a
few lifeless seasons while the producers waited to cash out their
millions and move to Maui. Weirdly, remarkably, the show just kept
getting better.
</P>
<P>
   The writing became sharper, more focused. The art got richer and
more varied when the show brought in new animators. Year after
year, like only a handful of series, ``The Simpsons'' has become
funnier by maintaining its facility for surprising us even as it
has become more familiar.
</P>
<P>
   (A cautionary note here: Any discussion of the ways and means of
comedy is completely subjective, so you'll just have to trust me on
some of this stuff. Trying to analyze why something is funny is a
deadly enterprise, as E.B. White first instructed us. If further
proof is necessary, attend a graduate symposium on the mechanics of
laughter or see this month's alarmingly unfunny ``humor'' issue of
GQ magazine.)
</P>
<P>
   That the show's executive producers _ Groening, James L. Brooks
and Sam Simon _ have found the secret formula for refreshing the
show and its staff on a regular basis deserves high praise. Thanks
are due as well to the Fox honcho Rupert Murdoch for leaving the
show alone. (One can only assume that he's never actually seen it;
otherwise it would be billed as ``The Simpsons: Assault on Sex
Mountain.'')
</P>
<P>
   Like most successful prime-time animated shows of the past (and
all truly fine comedy of any kind, really), ``The Simpsons'' works
on several levels at once. Most children of my acquaintance enjoy
the wrack and splatter of the visual gags while their parents
delight in the crackerjack dialogue and its satiric subversions of
the common wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the semi-adults like me who enjoy both. It's like
watching a Noel Coward play performed in a burning fireworks
factory.
</P>
<P>
   Each episode is a comedy primer, a night school master class in
the nuance of the pratfall and the metronomic precision of a
well-rendered double take. That the writers aren't hobbled by live
humans on screen gives them an unfair advantage over other sitcoms.
</P>
<P>
   They needn't suffer the limiting insufficiencies of actors, or
the pesky laws of physics, but can instead borrow liberally from
the slapstick handbook of Keaton or the Stooges and reframe those
classic gags in a world unhindered by gravity or pain.
</P>
<P>
   But what makes the show such a standout, and perhaps accounts
for its continued success, is its commitment to character. More
human than the cardboard cutouts that pass for characters on
creatively bankrupt series like ``Jesse'' or ``It's Like, You Know
... '' the Simpsons are a fun-house mirror reflection of the
``average'' American family, as it still persists in our national
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Marge, the long-suffering, infinitely patient proto-mom, is the
solid presence of loving reason around whom the family orbits. She
also has the toughest, and arguably most important, role on the
show, that of straight woman to the rest of the cast. Her deadpan
setups are as necessary to ``The Simpsons'' as the very air.
</P>
<P>
   Bart and Lisa, the scapegrace and the overachiever, the
delinquent yin and bookish yang, id and superego of American
children everywhere, are characters far richer and more fully
evoked than the one-dimensional little wisenheimers so often seen
dissing their parents on other sitcoms. Their fears and neuroses
prevent these two from becoming simple punch-line delivery
platforms in the manner of the Olsen twins.
</P>
<P>
   Maggie, the baby, 10 years in and still speechless, remains
eloquent and expressive in her silence. The Gielgud of the binky.
</P>
<P>
   It is Homer Simpson, though, who drives the show. In the first
few seasons, Bart and his vandal's antics accounted for most of the
show's stories. He was the hottest character on television and on
toy store shelves, and had the producers succumbed to the seduction
of a series based completely on the catch phrase ``Eat my shorts,''
the show would have lasted a few years, worn thin and then
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Wisely, though, around the fourth season, the show began more
and more to put Homer at the center of things. A chuckleheaded
Everyman in pursuit of happiness, of an easy day in the hammock or
a lucrative used-grease concession, Homer is at once the best and
worst of American dadness.
</P>
<P>
   He is forever wanting the things he'll never have, scheming to
get them and failing, his appetites and disappointments as classic
as the central conflicts from which all great theater and
literature derives. Homer's struggle with an indifferent universe
owes as much to the ``Poetics'' of Aristotle as it does to Ralph
Kramden.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a flawless cast and brilliantly consistent writing,
``The Simpsons'' is, quite simply, the best show on television.
Undimmed by imitators and unbowed by age, it remains the most
potent argument a cranky old media critic can make for owning a
television set. And a pair of ``Ay, caramba!'' boxer shorts.

--Deep in the Heart of Texas Backyard Molasses Mopped Chicken
<TEXT>
<P>
   From Dean Fearing, executive corporate chef, the Mansion on
Turtle Creek in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   1 (3- to 4-pound) chicken &QL; 
1 tablespoon canola oil &QL; 
Salt, ground black pepper and dried thyme to taste &QL; 
Crushed red bell pepper flakes to taste &QL; 
3 cups unsulfured molasses
</P>
<P>
   Rinse chicken under cold running water. Remove giblets, pat dry
and cut into quarters. Brush with oil. Season on both sides with
salt, pepper, thyme and pepper flakes. Set aside. Clean grill and
make the fire with charcoal and a few hickory wood chips. Soak
remaining hickory chips in water for smoking. When charcoal burns
down to a white ash, arrange chicken quarters, skin side down, on
grill. Render as much grease from the skin as possible without
burning skin or causing grease flare-ups that burn the skin. Take
your time and watch carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Add water-soaked hickory chips, a small handful at a time, to
the edge of the fire to start the smoking process. Close top of
grill to seal in smoke. Watch chicken closely and turn after about
8 to 10 minutes when the skin has rendered its fat. If the smoke
dies down, add another handful of chips.
</P>
<P>
   Grill and smoke chicken about 15 minutes, making sure the meat
is cooking evenly on both sides. Then begin basting each piece of
chicken with molasses. Don't be afraid to put a heavy coating of
molasses on chicken. Keep turning each piece to prevent burning.
Remove barbecued chicken from grill to a platter when done. Serve
immediately. Makes 4 servings.

<P>
   --Jeffrey's Oyster Nachos
</P>
<P>
   From chef David Garrido of Jeffrey's Restaurant and Bar in
Austin. This is one of the best oyster dishes the Food editor has
ever had.
</P>
<P>
   Canola oil for frying &QL; 
Buttermilk and flour for dredging &QL; 
16 fresh raw oysters &QL; 
16 Yuca Nacho Chips (recipe follows) &QL; 
{ cup each: Pico de Gallo and Habanero Mayo (recipes follow)
</P>
<P>
   In a small skillet, heat 1 inch of oil to 375 degrees. Place
buttermilk and flour in 2 shallow bowls. Soak oysters in
buttermilk, then dip into flour (oysters should be lightly coated).
Fry each oyster 45 seconds to 1 minute or until lightly browned.
Drain oysters on paper towels. To serve: Put a teaspoonful of Pico
de Gallo on each chip. Top with a fried oyster and { teaspoon
Habanero Mayo. Makes 16 nachos.
</P>
<P>
   --Yuca Nacho Chips
</P>
<P>
   2 yuca roots (cassava or manioc), peeled and thinly sliced &QL; 
{ cup vegetable oil &QL; 
Sea salt &QL; 
Soak yuca slices in hot water 15 minutes, then drain. Heat oil in a
skillet to 375 degrees; fry chips 1 minute or until light brown.
Drain on absorbent paper and dust with sea salt. Makes about 2
dozen.
</P>
<P>
   --Habanero Mayo
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons each: Dijon mustard and honey &QL; 
{ cup chopped cilantro leaves &QL;

2 egg yolks (see note) &QL; 
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice &QL; 
{ teaspoon sea salt &QL; 
{ cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   In a blender, mix mustard, honey, cilantro, habanero, egg yolks,
lemon juice and salt. Turn blender on. Remove the cap in blender
and with motor running, gradually pour a thin stream of oil onto
the yolk mixture until it thickens. Refrigerate. Makes 1{ cups.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Because this recipe calls for raw eggs, which can increase
the risk of salmonella poisoning, use pasteurized eggs or egg
substitute for yolks. Or use 1 cup bottled mayonnaise mixed with
mustard, honey, cilantro and habanero.
</P>
<P>
   -- Pico de Gallo
</P>
<P>
   1 cup diced tomato &QL; 
{ cup diced onion &QL;

``temper'' egg mixture by adding 1 cup cream mixture. Mix well and
whisk remaining cream mixture into egg mixture. Strain custard.
Pour custard into 8 (6-ounce) ramekins or souffl dishes. Place in
larger pan of water that comes up halfway to top of ramekins.
</P>
<P>
   Bake until custard is set but still a little loose in center, 30
to 40 minutes. Refrigerate until cool. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon brown
sugar over tops and flame with a propane torch until sugar is
caramelized. Or place ramekins on baking sheet and heat under
broiler until sugar is caramelized. Watch carefully. Garnish with

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Editor's note: Zoe has umlauf over the e.) 
 
By ANN CRISWELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Notes from all over: Recent short trips to New York,
Dallas and Austin turned up some fun food experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Lunch at Zoe in SoHo in New York City was one of the highlights
of a weekend there. Did you know SoHo means South of Houston Street
(or ``HOW-ston'' as they say in New York)?
</P>
<P>
   Zoe was recommended by a friend, Nancy Murray, over tea at
Takashimaya, the Japanese department store (a must-see for New York
visitors). Murray was fashion editor at the Chronicle in the
mid-1980s, when her byline was Nancy Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   Zoe, at 90 Prince St., is a high-profile restaurant known for
good food and good times. Diners at a late lunch were enjoying
their food, reminiscent of the hot restaurants in Houston such as
Mark's, Backstreet Cafe, Rainbow Lodge or Daily Review.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Reilly, executive chef, turns out adventurous fare:
Charred Lamb Salad With Avocado, Mango, Peanuts and Spicy Harissa
Sauce; Rotisserie Long Island Duck Breast With Warm Blueberry and
Confit Salad, Hash Brown Potato Cake and Honey-Lavender Sauce; and
Jasmine Rice Crusted Soft Shell Crabs on a Warm Beet and Vidalia
Onion Salad With Lemon Brown Butter Sauce.
</P>
<P>
   The lunch menu is equally creative, with such choices as Grilled
Tuna Club Sandwich on Semolina Bread With Applewood Smoked Bacon,
Tomato, Wasabi Mayonnaise and Miso-Carrot Salad (the salad cried
out for seconds); Salad of Seasonal Greens With Toasted Pumpkin
Seed-Verjus Dressing and Slow-Roasted Tomatoes; and House Smoked
Scottish Salmon with Crispy Taro Cakes and Rotisserie Pineapple.
</P>
<P>
   The food was so impressive we complimented the chef on the way
out and met the co-owner, Stephen Loffredo. He said the company
almost opened a restaurant in Houston. They were competing for the
space at the new Saks Fifth Avenue in Galleria, now home of Ruggles
Grille 5115. Loffredo said he and his wife, Thalia, are still
interested in the area and something may develop in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Zoe is the Greek word for life. The restaurant, located in a
copper-topped 19th-century landmark building, is named for Thalia's
grandmother. Diners can sit at the food bar looking into an
exhibition kitchen with wood-burning stove and rotisserie. It is
the source of rotisserie items that have guests standing in line to
see what Reilly will create next. If you go, save room for desserts
from pastry chef Jennifer McClintick. There's a weekend brunch. If
you are going to be in the city, call 212-966-6722 for
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers have already discovered the Loffredos' newest
restaurant, Cena, named for their daughter. It's in the Flatiron
neighborhood, 12 East 22nd St. Call 212-505-1222.
</P>
<P>
   Another New York neighborhood eatery that was a happy discovery
was Cafe Europa, 205 West 57th St., cater-cornered from Carnegie
Hall a block or so from Central Park. It's a great place for
late-night pastry (excellent strudel) and coffee, a sandwich after
shopping or Sunday morning breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   --On to Dallas
</P>
<P>
   If you ever doubted that there are umpteen thousand ways to cook
chicken, you should have been a guest at the National Chicken
Cooking Contest in Dallas recently. As a judge, I sampled chicken
for five straight hours, and still was able to enjoy it at every
official event hosted by the National Chicken Council.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity chef Dean Fearing of the Mansion on Turtle Creek (who
has had to forgo cowboy boots for sabots in the kitchen because of
a foot problem) personally grilled every piece of chicken for the
food editors' dinner at the hotel, he said. Fearing, a native of
Kentucky who helped pioneer Southwestern cuisine, had South in the
mouth this time around. You've never had greens like his mustard
greens mixed with a wonderful ham and cream sauce and corn bread
pan stuffing. Peach-jalapeo chutney was a zesty addition.

   Chilled Corn Vichyssoise With Grilled Lobster Relish started the
three-course dinner, and guests were scraping their soup bowls.
Dessert was a futuristic interpretation of coconut cream pie with
tropical fruit ambrosia.
</P>
<P>
   -- ... and Austin
</P>
<P>
   The day after the chicken cook-off, food editors moved on to
Austin. Lunch was set under a tent on the lawn at the Governor's
Mansion. Gov. and Mrs. George W. Bush were in Dallas for the
governor to give the commencement address at SMU). The mansion is
being extensively renovated, but we were able to tour it.
</P>
<P>
   The three-course lunch was prepared by one of Austin's finest,
David Garrido, chef at Jeffrey's Restaurant and Bar, who wowed
guests with the first course, Oyster Nachos (light, crisply fried
oysters on Yuca Nacho Chips with Habanero Mayo; recipe follows).
</P>
<P>
   Chicken was the entree, of course, but Garrido's preparation was
intriguing. Boneless chicken breasts were seared, then simmered in
red wine and seasonings, reheated in hot oil, drained and served
over sweet potatoes with mango salsa spiked with habanero. Garrido
does a similar beef dish at Jeffrey's, Top Sirloin on Yuca Root
Chips With Habanero, Chipotle and Papaya Pico.
</P>
<P>
   The dessert was a silky creme brulee richly flavored with
espresso coffee and lightly studded with pecans. Each course was
matched with wines from Fall Creek Vineyards. Ed and Susan Auler,
owners of the Tow, Texas, winery, commented on the wines _ Fall
Creek's 1998 Sauvignon Blanc (a perfect match for the oysters) and
Meritus 1996 with the chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Garrido is the son of a Mexican diplomat; he was born in Canada
but grew up in Mexico, Puerto Rico and Costa Rica and was schooled
in Switzerland. He brings an international approach to his cooking,
which also is expressed in his cookbook, ``Nuevo Tex-Mex''
(Chronicle Books, $19.95). He's working on a second cookbook
commemorating the 25th anniversary of Jeffrey's. The award-winning
restaurant is at 1204 W. Lynn in Austin. Call 512-477-5584.
</P>
<P>
   Two more outstanding meals awaited us, the first at Hudson's on
the Bend, 3509 Ranch Road 620 North, about an hour's drive from
Austin. The second was Sunday brunch at Fonda San Miguel.
</P>
<P>
   Award-winning chef Jeff Blank hosted the group at his showplace
home on Hudson Bend on Lake Travis, where he teaches cooking
classes. Designed by his son as his master's thesis in
architecture, the house is multilevel and fits right into the
setting. There's lots of natural cedar, indigenous plants and
fabulous vistas. The guest house walls are cedar, so the aroma
might remind inhabitants of sleeping in a cedar chest.
</P>
<P>
   Blank's wife, Shanny Lott, is an artist and did many of the
paintings in the house and the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Blank and the executive chef for the restaurant, Jay Moore, his
co-author, demonstrated several recipes from ``Cooking
Fearlessly,'' their cookbook to be published in September, in the
cooking school area. Food editors adjourned to the restaurant for
dinner. The menu was an eye-opener to many food editors from the
outland: Diamond Back Rattlesnake in a Pistachio Nut Crust over
Chipotle Sauce with Jicama and Cactus Salad dressed with Gingered
Lime Vinaigrette; Pecan Smoked Axis Backstrap Stuffed With Lobster
Standing in Ancho Bock Beer Smashed Potatoes painted with Mango
Jalapeo Sauce and criss-crossed with Peppercorn Sauce.
</P>
<P>
   The next ``fearless'' course was Wild Boar and Chicken Nogales
with Maytag Blue Cheese Grits and tri-color Mexican Flag Sauces.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone whose appetite was waning was revitalized with dessert,
Chambord Mousse with Legs of Fudge a k a Tina Turner Mousse. Blank
said he honored the performer for her unforgettable voice and great
legs _ ``legs'' being the term for streams of wine that cling, then
slide down the inside of a glass when wine is swirled. ``In this
case, the legs are swirling chocolate, which makes a tempting
presentation.''
</P>
<P>
   Signature gourmet sauces developed for the restaurant are sold
in some gourmet supermarkets: Hudson's on the Bend Mexican Marigold
Mint Mustard, Tomatillo White Chocolate Sauce (a startling take on
mole sauce with tomatillos, cilantro, sesame seeds and a bit of
Belgian white chocolate), Bourbon Vanilla Praline Sauce and Mango
Jalapeno Aeoli. The Orange Ginger BBQ Sauce or Chipotle BBQ Sauce
add culinary fireworks to barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   For cooking class schedules or to order sauces or gift crates
and a recipe brochure, call 800-996-7655.
</P>
<P>
   Just when we thought we couldn't stuff another morsel, it was
time for Sunday brunch at Fonda San Miguel. Four buffet tables were
piled high with specialties from this authentic Mexican restaurant
in Austin, which has the stamp of approval of Mexican cooking diva
Diana Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   One table held entrees including mole, shrimp dishes and
carnitas; the second one held salads and appetizers; the third,
side dishes; and the fourth, desserts. Conservative guests, who
started with just a bite of this and that, went back for seconds,
then thirds on Torta Elote (a glorification of corn pudding),
shrimp, Nopalitos Salad and desserts such as coconut gelatin,
almond squares and Mexican rice pudding.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who can't visit Austin without touring H.E.B.'s
Central Market (and when is Houston getting one?). Now there's a
choice of the original on Lamar or the new Central Market on the
corner of South Lamar and Ben White Boulevard in Westgate Mall.
Central Market is the second biggest tourist attraction in Austin
now after the State Capitol.

<P>
   BRUSSELS _ With a familiar red ``Enjoy Coca-Cola'' sign glowing
above her head, Francine Craeghs paused Wednesday afternoon to
consider the refreshments chilling behind the glass of a cooler in
a small market.
</P>
<P>
   Inside were bottles and cans of Orangina, V-8, various fruit
juices and something called Winny Cola -- but not a drop of the
familiar caramel-colored soft drink.
</P>
<P>
   Craeghs settled for orange juice. ``You know I'm pregnant
anyway, so I must be more careful,'' she said with little remorse.
``And I can live without Coke.''
</P>
<P>
   Each day, more and more Europeans are learning to live without
Coke. Prompted by reports of about 100 cases of illnesses related
to drinking Coca-Cola products, the Belgian government on Monday
took the exceptional step of banning all beverages made by the
Atlanta-based soft-drink giant.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Coke story dominated the nation's newspapers,
each devoting multiple pages to the health scare -- including
hotline numbers, health tips and accounts of Coke's mythical
Atlanta origins.
</P>
<P>
   The story even overshadowed the crisis being managed by the
well-known Brussels concern, NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Across the capital, Coke vending machines were dark and
unresponsive. Empty sections on grocery store shelves marked where
Coke, Fanta, Sprite and other Coca-Cola products had been
displayed. At Quick restaurants, the French fast-food chain, signs
were posted informing customers that they must forgo Cokes with
their burgers and pome frits.
</P>
<P>
   Since June 8, more than 100 people -- most of them
schoolchildren -- have reported suffering headaches, nausea and
dizziness after drinking Coca-Cola products. On Monday, 38
schoolgirls were taken to a hospital in the town of Ghent after
drinking Coca-Cola bought from a vending machine.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the company announced that it had determined that
some of its soft drinks had become contaminated with a fungicide
and others had been infused with faulty carbon dioxide, but
stressed that there was no serious health threat.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the company's attempts to allay concerns, however,
Belgium's lead was followed by the Netherlands and Luxembourg on
Tuesday and France on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Across Europe, governments from Poland to Spain reassured their
citizens that it was safe to drink Coca-Cola in their countries,
perhaps inadvertently suggesting to consumers questions about a
product heretofore regarded as the essence of wholesomeness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a drop of oil, spreading across the top of the
water,'' said Meike Van den Berghe, the spokeswoman for Belgium's
Ministry of Health. ``When will it stop?''
</P>
<P>
   That's a good question given the rising anxiety in Europe about
the safety of food coupled with widespread loss of faith in public
officials assigned to assure the safety of such products.
</P>
<P>
   The Coke crisis follows the discovery in Belgium earlier this
year of cancer-causing dioxin in chickens and eggs. The dioxin
revelations so angered the public that the government was
overthrown Sunday in national elections.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, the media and government have for months been locked
in nasty debate over safety of genetically modified food, a fairly
common and noncontroversial part of American diets. Additionally,
fears over ``mad cow disease'' still ripple through European food
politics. Consumers across the continent and Britain strongly
support a European Union ban on hormone-treated beef imports from
the United States, even through there is no scientific evidence of
heath damage from consuming such beef.
</P>
<P>
   These attitudes are regarded as partly cultural and partly
political. Europeans often express suspicions about food,
particularly when it comes from any source other than small
familiar vegetable markets, which are rapidly disappearing as
American-style supermarkets move in.
</P>
<P>
   And even though Europe is being reassembled under a unified
economy, there is no independent central authority for assuring
food safety. In the absence of such a body, food scares often
become hot political weapons used by the parties out of power to
attack the parties in power.
</P>
<P>
   This difficult atmosphere could slow Coca-Cola's recovery,
particularly when few signs indicate that the company is out of the
woods with the Belgian government.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the company has admitted problems with its products,
Belgian officials remain unsatisfied and believe the soft drink
concern reacted slowly and arrogantly to their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Belgian Health Minister Luc Van de Bossche criticized Coca-Cola
for a lack of cooperation in handling the health scare. He also has
said that the company waited too long before acting on the
complaints, which surfaced a week before the company acknowledged
that there was anything wrong with its products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disturbing that a big firm with worldwide fame did not
take far-reaching measures more spontaneously and more promptly,''
Van de Bossche said on a local television broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, government officials say that they were moved to
impose the ban out of frustration over Coke's response.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the company has held a news conference to reveal its
discovery that there were problems with its products, Coke has not
provided any information directly to the government, which is
conducting its own research into the illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ban remains,'' said Van de Berghe Wednesday afternoon.
``And it will remain until the government is satisfied that
Coca-Cola has explained adequately what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The government wants the company to produce a written report,
which will be reviewed by government scientists, she said.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the ban remains, questions about the quality of Coke
products are likely to linger in the minds of skeptical Europeans.
Additionally, threats of lawsuits in Belgium by some of the people
who fell ill also are likely to keep the soft drink company in the
limelight.
</P>
<P>
   While Coke's lost sales in Belgium mean little to its worldwide
empire, the potential damage to its reputation could prove a more
serious threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest risk is not to earnings,'' said Marc Cohen, an
analyst at Goldman Sachs. ``The risk is to perceptions about the
integrity of the product.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Pepsi -- which was a common sight on cafe
tables Wednesday -- is more than happy to keep cola consumers here
happy.
</P>
<P>
   Luc Van Lanenhove, who handles orders for Pepsi products in
Belgium, said he's already seeing the impact. ``Since this morning,
the telephone hasn't stopped ringing,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
   This difficult atmosphere could slow Coca-Cola's recovery,
particularly when few signs indicate that the company is out of the
woods with the Belgian government.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the company has admitted problems with its products,
Belgian officials remain unsatisfied and believe the soft drink
concern reacted slowly and arrogantly to their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Belgian Health Minister Luc Van de Bossche criticized Coca-Cola
for a lack of cooperation in handling the health scare. He also has
said that the company waited too long before acting on the
complaints, which surfaced a week before the company acknowledged
that there was anything wrong with its products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disturbing that a big firm with worldwide fame did not
take far-reaching measures more spontaneously and more promptly,''
Van de Bossche said on a local television broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, government officials say that they were moved to
impose the ban out of frustration over Coke's response.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the company has held a news conference to reveal its
discovery that there were problems with its products, Coke has not
provided any information directly to the government, which is
conducting its own research into the illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ban remains,'' said Van de Berghe Wednesday afternoon.
``And it will remain until the government is satisfied that
Coca-Cola has explained adequately what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The government wants the company to produce a written report,
which will be reviewed by government scientists, she said.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the ban remains, questions about the quality of Coke
products are likely to linger in the minds of skeptical Europeans.
Additionally, threats of lawsuits in Belgium by some of the people
who fell ill also are likely to keep the soft drink company in the
limelight.
</P>
<P>
   While Coke's lost sales in Belgium mean little to its worldwide
empire, the potential damage to its reputation could prove a more
serious threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest risk is not to earnings,'' said Marc Cohen, an
analyst at Goldman Sachs. ``The risk is to perceptions about the
integrity of the product.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Pepsi -- which was a common sight on cafe
tables Wednesday -- is more than happy to keep cola consumers here
happy.
</P>
<P>
   Luc Van Lanenhove, who handles orders for Pepsi products in
Belgium, said he's already seeing the impact. ``Since this morning,
the telephone hasn't stopped ringing,'' he said.

GORE OPENS PRESIDENTIAL BID WITH STRESS ON FAMILY VALUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTHAGE, Tenn. _ Vice President Al Gore officially opened his
bid for the White House Wednesday by outlining his vision of a Gore
presidency but making only a small effort to distance himself from
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``With your help, I will take my own values of faith and family
to the presidency _ to build an America that is not only better
off, but better,'' Gore told a gathering of a thousand or more
supporters gathered in front of the Smith County courthouse in this
small Tennessee town of 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   In a voice sometimes raspy with emotion, Gore mentioned Clinton
only twice. He praised the president _ and himself _ for bringing
down the budget deficit and creating 19 million new jobs. And he
told the cheering crowd that Clinton ``was right to stand for
freedom'' in the just-concluded NATO bombing campaign over
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath a hazy sun in a courthouse square festooned with Gore
2000 banners, the 51-year-old president sought to etch a vision for
his own presidency after six years of waiting in the wings under
President Clinton. It was a vision focused on cultural issues that
frequently defy governmental solutions.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks came a day after a television interview in which he
said the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal that nearly consumed the
Clinton presidency had made 1998 ``an awful year'' in which he
tried to ``provide some stability and continuity'' by showing up
``for work every day to keep things moving in the right
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's speech Wednesday was laced with phrases in Spanish _ an
apparent appeal to Hispanic voters, a key Democratic constituency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without action, words mean nothing although they might be nice
ones,'' he said in Spanish at one point. ``My friends, we will
continue working together, hand to hand, for the future of our
families and children.''
</P>
<P>
   And he said that success in closing the budget deficit meant
only that America must turn its attention to ``a deficit of even
greater danger ... the time deficit in family life; the decency
deficit in our common culture; the care deficit for our little ones
and our elderly parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by his wife, Tipper, their four children and his mother
Pauline, Gore ticked through campaign themes that set Democrats and
Republicans apart. He said he favors abortion rights, legislation
regulating managed care health plans, and tougher gun restrictions
_ and opposes privatizing Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said he would focus on what he described as
intangible negatives of American culture that legislation alone
cannot fix.
</P>
<P>
   ``No policy proposal can change a culture that does not place
family life at the top of our hierarchy of values where it
belongs,'' he said. ``History makes no promises to keep the good
times going in the absence of our own wise choices. It is all too
easy to slide backward if we are not vigilant.''
</P>
<P>
   Families need protection from ``a culture of violence and
mayhem'' depicted on television, movies, music and other in other
media, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said American parents must ``master'' their own lives
``if we are to have the moral authority to guide our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Some saw Gore's use of such phrases as ``moral authority'' and
``values and faith and family'' as efforts by the vice president to
distance himself from questions about Clinton's character.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy campaign director Marla Romash dismissed such an
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he did today was talk to the American people about issues
that are important and how he'll take his faith, family and values
to the presidency,'' she said. ``He's trying to explain to the
American people what a Gore presidency would be like. This is the
start of the Gore campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   J.V. Derring, 68, a retired electric utility worker who watched
the Gore speech, was skeptical about whether Gore could separate
himself from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything about Clinton has been crooked,'' he said, adding
that he had not decided whether to vote for Gore. ``I think Al Gore
is a pretty decent, moral kind of fellow. I hope he's his own man,
but it's hard to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   But supporters in the crowd had fewer doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the right man at the right time,'' said William Hayes,
55, a lawyer from Beloit, Wis., who detoured to Carthage from a
country music festival in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   In Carthage and later in a speech at the University of Iowa in
Iowa City, Gore took a swipe at Texas Gov. George W. Bush's
description of himself as a ``compassionate conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he wanted to keep prosperity going ``the right way,
not by letting people fend for themselves, or hoping for crumbs of
compassion, but by giving people the skills and knowledge to
succeed in their own right in the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, he threw in a pitch for extending prosperity to ``the
farmers and farm communities that are hurting right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by reporters whether his admonition to parents to master
their lives extended to Clinton in the wake of the Lewinsky sex
scandal, Gore replied: ``It applies to every single American.''

<P>
   Carthage is near Possum Hollow, where Gore's father, the late
Sen. Albert Gore Sr., ran a 250-acre farm. Gore's mother still
lives there and the vice president and Tipper Gore have an 88-acre
farm of their own nearby.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, the down-home qualities of Carthage were in sharp
contrast with the marble monuments of Washington, where Gore was
born and lived for much of his early life. Gore has used Carthage
as a backdrop for the kickoff of all his political campaigns,
dating back to his first run for the House of Representatives in
1976.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on Wednesday tried turning the Carthage-Washington
contrast to their advantage. Republican National Committee Chairman
Jim Nicholson scheduled a tour of what an RNC press release called
``Al Gore's boyhood home'' _ a luxury hotel in downtown Washington
where Gore and his parents lived during his youth.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Coelho, general chairman of the Gore campaign, described
the RNC tour of Gore's Washington ``homestead'' as ``too cute.'' He
added that Gore worked on his Carthage speech until 11:30 p.m.
Tuesday night, going over nuances with his three daughters and
Tipper.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the Carthage crowd defended Gore as an authentic local.
</P>
<P>
   ` `He was raised up right here in Carthage,'' said Clairborne
Carter, 52, a school janitor who worked with Gore on the Gore
family's farm. ``Me and Al grew up together. We raised Aberdeen
Angus cows and plowed the fields. He was a hard worker.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is still his hometown,'' said Retta O'Dell, a 36-year-old
homemaker and Carthage native. ``Where your roots are is where
you're at.''

RECIPES FOR BASIC ICE CREAM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   --Basic Custard Ice Cream
</P>
<P>
   From Chronicle files.
</P>
<P>
   For safety, homemade ice cream should be made with cooked egg
custards, pasteurized eggs or egg substitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Raw eggs can carry the salmonella bacteria, which causes a
serious, potentially fatal, food-borne illness. Cooking eggs to a
temperature of 160 degrees kills the bacteria, but boiling (212
degrees) will curdle eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Egg substitutes may be used instead of raw eggs because they
have been heat-pasteurized. Most substitutes are made from egg
whites with oil and other additives. Use \ cup substitute for each
egg in the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   If you take the time to make a cooked custard ice cream with
real egg yolks, you'll find the extra effort gives superior
quality. Egg yolks are about 10 percent lecithin, an emulsifier
that helps maintain the even dispersal of fat droplets throughout
the ice cream and keeps ice crystals minimal for a smoother,
silkier and richer ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   -- Revising recipes
</P>
<P>
   To convert an ice cream recipe that calls for raw eggs, combine
milk (or cream), beaten eggs and sugar in a saucepan. Cook over low
heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and reaches
165 degrees on a candy thermometer. (If you don't have a
thermometer, use a metal spoon: The custard is the proper
consistency when it lightly coats a metal spoon, and your finger
leaves a path when drawn across the back of the coated spoon.)
</P>
<P>
   Don't let the mixture boil, or it will curdle.
</P>
<P>
   Remove custard from heat before adding other ingredients. Cool
custard base completely in the refrigerator before freezing in your
ice cream maker.
</P>
<P>
   If the mixture is warmer than 40 degrees (refrigerator
temperature) when freezing begins, the increased churning time
required may produce flecks of butter. Although harmless, the
butter flecks will ruin the texture.
</P>
<P>
   For quicker cooling, pour cooked custard into a chilled shallow
container and place in refrigerator, or cool over an ice water
bath.
</P>
<P>
   -- No ice cream maker?
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have a machine, you can make ice cream, frozen
yogurt, sherbets and sorbets in the freezer with a process known as
still-freezing. You'll need either a food processor or electric
mixer.
</P>
<P>
   First, turn your freezer to its coldest setting. Ice cream will
have a smoother texture if it is frozen quickly. Before starting,
chill all equipment and ingredients, such as fruit juices and
pures. Because there is no continuous agitation of ice cream during
the freezing, the quantity and texture won't be the same as from an
ice cream maker.
</P>
<P>
   Food processor technique: Pour prepared ingredients into a loaf
pan, an 8-inch square pan or a 9-by-13-by-2-inch pan. Cover with
foil or plastic wrap, and place in freezer. Freeze until solid (1
to 2 hours). Break frozen mixture into pieces; spoon into food
processor fitted with metal blade. Process until soft but not
melted. Repeat freezing and processing 1 or 2 more times if
desired.
</P>
<P>
   Mixer technique: Pour prepared ingredients into a metal mixer
bowl, cover with foil or plastic wrap, and place in freezer. Freeze
2 hours or until firm at edges and semisoft in center. Beat with
electric mixer on medium-high until mixture is soft but not melted.
Repeat freezing and beating 1 or 2 more times if desired.
</P>
<P>
   Final touches: With either method, after final processing or
beating, stir or fold in any whole or chopped nuts, pieces of candy
or cookies, and pieces of fruit or prepared ingredients used to
produce a swirled or marbled effect.
</P>
<P>
   Most homemade ice cream should be allowed to ``ripen,'' or rest,
for about an hour before eating to allow the flavors to blend.
Homemade ice cream should be kept frozen no longer than 2 days. If
stored for long periods, ice cream develops ice crystals on top and
takes on a heavy, undesirable texture.

GOOD INFLATION NEWS MAY EASE PRESSURE TO RAISE INTEREST RATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Filed in the ``w'' and ``f'' categories.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Government economic reports released Wednesday show
that the U.S. economy continues to be strong while inflation
remains in check, easing pressure on the Federal Reserve Board to
raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   A new report on consumer prices, which is the nation's main
inflation indicator, showed that prices paid by consumers for a
range of goods _ from airline tickets to tobacco products _
remained unchanged in May following an unexpected jump of 0.7
percent in April.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding food and energy prices, consumer prices rose 0.1
percent during May. Energy prices fell 1.3 percent and gasoline
prices dropped by 2.5 percent in May after a 15 percent spike in
April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inflation was a no-show,'' said Sung Won Sohn, an economist at
Wells Fargo Bank in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday, many Wall Street analysts feared that the
Federal Reserve would almost certainly boost interest rates, or the
federal funds rate, to 5 percent from its current level of 4.75
percent when the board meets June 29 and 30.
</P>
<P>
   An interest rate increase would be passed along by banks to
consumers in the form of higher rates on consumer and home equity
loans, and credit-card interest rates. An interest rate increase
also makes the cost of borrowing more expensive for businesses,
which would likely slow the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and Wall Street will be looking to a speech on
monetary policy that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is
scheduled to give Thursday before the Joint Economic Committee of
Congress. They will search for hints on whether he will follow
through with recent warnings that a rate increase was likely.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Bank Corp. in Pittsburgh,
said it ``remains a toss up'' whether the Fed will boost rates.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets have already factored in an interest rate
hike, with stock prices wobbling and government bonds rising in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond has risen by nearly a
half of a percentage point since the Fed indicated in May that it
was leaning toward boosting rates. Last week the 30-year bond hit a
19-month high of 6.16 percent. This has caused mortgage rates to
rise because they are tied to the bond market. A 30-year fixed-rate
mortgage is averaging about 7.75 percent, up from about 7 percent
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists say the market behavior alone could slow the
economy and allow the Fed to delay a rate hike. They also say with
little evidence of inflation, the Fed won't raise rates at its June
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Chairman Greenspan has enough evidence to hike
interest rates,'' Sohn said.
</P>
<P>
   Sohn said, however, that there's ``brewing evidence'' that
inflation may be on the rise, but that the Fed would likely wait
for more economic data to confirm the trend before deciding whether
to boost rates at its August meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Wages have started to creep upward and the prices of imported
goods have stopped falling as the economy in Asia begins a tortuous
rebound. Economists said economic troubles in Asia caused import
prices to fall for most of 1998, keeping a damper on inflation in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In recent speeches Greenspan and other Fed officials have
signaled that they will likely raise rates to slow the economy. The
last time the Fed raised interest rates was in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   William Poole, president of the Federal Reserve Bank St. Louis
branch, said earlier this month that economic growth has ``been
higher than can be sustained over the long haul.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, economists like former Federal Reserve Board governor
Lyle Gramley said that while inflation remains in check, the Fed is
likely to raise rates in order to gently slow the rate of growth.
</P>
<P>
   The economy has been growing at about a 4 percent pace, far
faster than the 2.5 percent level that Federal Reserve officials
believe is possible without eventually sparking price increases
that boost inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are speeding you are eventually going to get yourself
into trouble,'' said Gramley, who is a consulting economist at the
Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, the government reported that:
</P>
<P>
   _ Construction of new housing rose 6.3 percent in May after
falling by 9.7 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
   _ Industrial production, which measures the output of U.S.
factories, rose by 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ A survey of the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks said the
``U.S. economy remains strong'' as a result of continued consumer
spending. The survey reported record-low unemployment, but said
some regions are reporting rising wages, which could lead to
inflation.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   The financial markets reacted favorably to Wednesday's economic
news as their fears about inflation subsided.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 189.96 points to close at
10,784.95. It was the Dow's best performance since it crossed the
11,000 point threshold on May 3. The Nasdaq market experienced its
biggest one-day point gain by rising 103.16 points to close at
2517.83.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 30-year Treasury bonds fell to 6.06 percent
from 6.11 percent on Tuesday.

AT INAUGURATION, MBEKI CALLS FOR REBIRTH OF SOUTH AFRICA
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRETORIA, South Africa _ Thabo Mbeki became South Africa's
second post-apartheid president on Wednesday, taking over this
still racially divided country from Nelson Mandela, who, with
unerring grace, steered it through a peaceful transition out of
white supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after Mbeki took the oath of office in Tswana, English
and Afrikaans, the 80-year-old Mandela embraced his successor and
then both men turned and clasped hands high over their heads as the
crowd roared its approval.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Mbeki, 56, sounded many of the themes he has
become known for, promising that change would now come faster for
the millions of South Africans who live in dire poverty.
</P>
<P>
   But he also paid tribute to the freedom fighters who came before
him, including Mandela, who spent 27 years in prison for his belief
that he and other black South Africans should have the right to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki called on all South Africans, black and white, to continue
to work together for the rebirth of the country, made possible by
``the realization that we share a common destiny, regardless of the
shapes of our noses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nights cannot but be nights of nightmares while millions
of our people live in degrading poverty,'' he said. ``Sleep cannot
come easily when children get permanently disabled, both physically
and mentally, because of a lack of food.''
</P>
<P>
   The transition from Mandela to Mbeki has lacked the giddy
excitement of the 1994 election. But South Africans are reveling in
its ordinariness. In 1994 many whites stocked up on canned foods or
took ``strategic vacations.'' By contrast, Wednesday's ceremonies
competed for attention with a soccer match and the national
marathon.
</P>
<P>
   The inauguration ceremony, attended by hundreds of foreign
dignitaries, was in some ways austere, taking only about an hour.
But it was not without its glitches.
</P>
<P>
   After Mbeki took the oath of office, five jets flew overhead,
leaving a rainbow-colored smoke trail. Then three helicopters
passed by, pulling huge South African flags. Then a Mirage fighter
roared past, painted as the South African flag. When nothing
further appeared, the master of ceremonies invited Mbeki to begin
his speech.
</P>
<P>
   He protested, saying there were more planes to come. But the
emcee insisted. When he was well into his address, three 747's
finally thundered over, low and slow, drowning him out. The two
outer planes bore messages painted under their wings. One said,
``President Thabo Mbeki.'' The other said, ``Thank you, Madiba,''
using Mandela's clan name.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela, who did not speak during the ceremony, has said he is
looking forward to retirement and in particular to spending more
time with his grandchildren. But his wife, Graca Machel, said
recently that she doubted he could sit still for long.
</P>
<P>
   The South Africa that Mbeki will inherit has changed a great
deal in the last five years. More than 500,000 new houses were
built and electricity, telephones lines and water taps have been
installed in millions of homes. But some critics have said Mandela
was more of a hero figure, focusing on reconciliation, than an
administrator, focusing on rebuilding a country that systematically
kept the black majority in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The country is still plagued by high crime, joblessness, poor
schools and a climbing AIDS rate. Nor has racial reconciliation
been easy. Some South Africans believe that the country is more
polarized then ever, as whites see their privileges diminishing and
blacks say change is not coming fast enough for them.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki, who has a economics degree from Sussex University in
England, has made it clear that he will turn his attention to
uplifting the poor. He is seen as an able administrator _ far less
forgiving than Mandela, who some said tended to console ministers
who had failed in a job rather than tell them off.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's ceremony did not include the swearing in of a deputy
president, as it did in 1994, because none has been chosen. The job
appears to have been offered to the leader of the Zulu-nationalist
Inkatha Freedom Party, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. The move is
intended to promote peace between Inkatha and the governing African
National Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But Buthelezi is said to be unhappy with changes that Mbeki
announced last week, which will greatly reduce the powers of the
job. Negotiations are continuing.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   South Africans are also waiting to see whom Mbeki will include
in his cabinet, which he is expected to announce on Thursday. While
Mandela's cabinet was a carefully chosen quilt of diverse South
Africans, meant to unify a country that has 11 languages and an
often violent history, Mbeki has said he will put far more emphasis
on competence.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's ceremonies were not without controversy. Statues of
apartheid-era heroes that are scattered on the lawn of the Union
Building, where the ceremonies were held, were draped in green
sackcloth.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have given various reasons, at one point saying the
statues were being hidden so as not to detract from the ``ecstasy''
of the occasion. The subject has kept radio talk shows in business
for days, with callers either applauding the idea or saying that
the country should never forget its history.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been some debate about the $8 million price tag
for the ceremony and free concert that lasted all afternoon and
into the night on the lawn in front of the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shouldn't have spent the money,'' said Ernest Nhlapo, 17,
who nevertheless was in attendance. ``They should build homes and
create more jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   But his friend Claudio Bowker, 16, disagreed. ``We deserve it,''
he said.'' This doesn't happen often. It's only the second time we
had such a ceremony.''
</P>
<P>
   Samson Malaka, 24, a student at the University of Pretoria, said
the money had been well spent because the world was watching, so it
was good marketing. ``It's an occasion of great magnitude,'' he
said. ``We should portray to the world that we are capable of such
an occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost the entire celebratory crowd on the Union Building lawn
was black, which troubled Stanley Sidimela, 25, a welfare worker
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to live with the whites, Indians and Coloreds, but to
our surprise they are not appreciating the new government,'' he
said. ``We don't know how to draw them in so we can celebrate with
them. They built these buildings, which helped us. But we don't
like their leaving the country _ we want to share its wealth
together.''

PRETORIA, South Africa: wealth together. ''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the crowd's makeup was the music, which
included South Africa's best jazz, gospel, kwaito and township jive
acts, including Hugh Masekela, Brenda Fassie, Rebecca Malope,
Bonga'maffin and Boom Shaka. As part of Mbeki's African Renaissance
theme, the organizers also invited many of Africa's best musicians,
like Angelique Kidjo and Papa Wemba. Local acts that draw white
audiences, like Springbok Nude Girls or Nico Carstens, were not on
the stage.
</P>
<P>
   A group of young women, all studying to be paralegals at the
Pretoria Technikon, led the center of the crowd in a circular
dance. ``We're here to party and to meet people,'' said Thandi
Nkomo, 18, ``But I liked Mbeki's speech. It was short, but it had
meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathabo Kgolumo, 21, said seeing the bookish new president speak
``gives us self-confidence, and it also improves our vocabulary.''
</P>
<P>
   The only icon that was more ubiquitous in the crowd than African
National Congress T-shirts was a pink sticker saying, ``Safe Sex
Save Lives _ Use a Condom.'' Tina Magongwa and Gladys Mamosadi of
the Mohau Children's Care Center were slapping the stickers as fast
as they could on anyone who walked by.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost no one says no,'' Mrs. Magongwa, 38, said. ```A few
say, `No, don't give me that; I will get AIDS from it,' but they
are just ignorant.'' The women were also handing out condoms _ just
about the only thing being given out free at the concert.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa has the world's fastest-growing AIDS epidemic,
largely because it was fatally slow to begin serious AIDS education
programs.

TARZAN WAS BORN TO BE WILD 

</HEADLINE>
 TARZAN-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) With an intriguing beginning, penned in 1911, Edgar
Rice Burroughs gave birth to one of the 20th century's best-known
creations, Tarzan:
</P>
<P>
   ``I had this story from one who had no business to tell it to
me, or to any other.''
</P>
<P>
   Of modern literary characters, perhaps only James Bond and
Sherlock Holmes are as instantly recognizable to so many people
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bond and Holmes, Tarzan won new and greater success on
screen and television. He has swung through almost 50 movies and
several TV shows, from high drama to low parody. He even survived
Bo Derek.
</P>
<P>
   The Lord of the Apes' latest manifestation as an animated hero
in Disney's ``Tarzan'' will add yet another generation of fans,
ensuring his success for decades to come.
</P>
<P>
   Like all the previous films, Disney's ``Tarzan'' reinvents the
Ape Man to its needs and style. Yet the original character remains.
</P>
<P>
   Tarzan is a classic version of the anti-establishment hero, with
a hint of the environmentalist tossed in. He believes in the
superiority of nature over human civilization. He kills his food
with his bare hands and eats meat raw, but he respects animals,
even his enemies, more than people.
</P>
<P>
   Even when he dons the clothes of his alternate personality, Lord
Greystoke, and works with people, he is the supreme loner, eager to
``tear off the thin veneer of civilization,'' along with his
clothes, and return to his jungle haunts.
</P>
<P>
   Tarzan is also a basic form of wish fulfillment, the character
who can conquer all through strength, skill and cunning, and live
happily without such irritations as jobs, clocks and freeways.
</P>
<P>
   In Burroughs' books, Tarzan is the son of John Clayton, Lord
Greystoke, and his wife, Lady Alice. In 1888, ship mutineers
abandon the English couple on the west coast of Africa, where they
build a cabin and have a son.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Alice dies and Clayton is killed by great apes. The
baby is adopted by a female ape, Kala.
</P>
<P>
   Tarzan grows to manhood and wins leadership of his tribe, while
teaching himself to read from books in his parents' cabin. His life
changes when American Jane Porter arrives in need of rescue, which
Tarzan supplies repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Tarzan learns fluent English, marries Jane and regains his
rightful title as Lord Greystoke. The couple, now rich and owning
estates in England, elect to live mainly in Africa (but on the
ground, not in a treehouse).
</P>
<P>
   In 24 novels _ some good, some repetitive _ Tarzan roams Africa,
finding lost civilizations, battling evil Europeans and generally
having a bang-up time.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe the answer could start with Tarzan's
unlikely creator, a self-taught writer who never even visited
Africa. Burroughs, has been the subject of many biographies, the
most, though not necessarily the best, the recent New York Times
praised ``Tarzan Forever: The life of Edgar Rice Burroughs'' by
John Taliaferro.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Chicago in 1875, Burroughs better-known as ERB to his
fans, led an early life chasing elusive success. To support a
growing family, he tried many careers, including cavalry officer in
Arizona, cowboy, clerk and business advisor.
</P>
<P>
   As he labored, he day-dreamed a more adventurous life. In
desperation _ and primarily for money, not love of writing _ he
tried his hand at creating the kind of adventure stories he enjoyed
reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tarzan of the Apes'' first appeared in a pulp magazine in
1912. It was an instant success. Movies were not far behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tarzan of the Apes'' was a 1918 silent film starring Elmo
Lincoln, a hulk of an actor who was far too old for the youthful
Tarzan character and not at all the sleek jungle man Burroughs had
envisioned. (Burroughs saw Tarzan as an Apollo, not a Hercules.)
There were eight more silent movies with four other stars, but it
was not until 1932 that Tarzan went first-class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tarzan, the Ape Man,'' starring young Olympic swimming hero
Johnny Weissmuller, was a prestige MGM talkie and the biggest film
success of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Geared to a star who was an athlete, not an actor, the film made
Tarzan a man of few and short words: the strong, silent type. Jane
Porter, now Jane Parker, was played by the young Maureen
O'Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tarzan, the Ape Man'' was followed by ``Tarzan and his Mate,''
widely regarded as the best of all Tarzan films and certainly _ in
the restored uncut version _ the sexiest. Weissmuller and
O'Sullivan really were jungle swingers.
</P>
<P>
   As MGM and Weissmuller made 10 more Tarzan movies, the scripts
became more juvenile, and Weissmuller grew flabbier. In 1949, Lex
Barker took over the vine for five films, followed by Gordon Scott
(six films), Denny Miller (one), Jock Mahony (two) and Mike Henry
(three). Ron Ely, who starred in one of several Tarzan TV series,
appeared in films made from television episodes. There were others.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few of these films stand out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tarzan's Greatest Adventure'' (1959), with Sean Connery as a
villain, and ``Tarzan the Magnificent'' (1960), both starring
Scott, were exciting, colorful adventures with decent scripts.
``Tarzan and the Valley of Gold'' (1966) played Tarzan (Henry) as a
jungle James Bond, sophisticated, smart and world-traveling.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982 came the infamously boring ``Tarzan, the Ape Man'' in
which Miles O'Keeffe's Tarzan takes a secondary role to Bo Derek's
usually nude Jane.
</P>
<P>
   The most ambitious Tarzan film was Hugh Hudson's classy-looking
``Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes.'' Too much
title, too much pretension. The opening hour, as Tarzan grows up in
the jungle, is marvelous, but the film becomes a misguided social
commentary that has little to do with Tarzan or adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the major movies are still available on tape, and the
books are still in publication in paperback.

YANKEES CHIEF URGES CONGRESS TO FUND MORE PROSTATE RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ New York Yankees manager Joe Torre, joined by
former Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole and junk bond king
Michael Milken, urged Congress Wednesday to increase federal
funding for prostate cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   Torre, 58, whose cancerous prostate was removed in March, said
his fight with cancer was unlike any challenge he had previously
faced in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to key milestones in his career as manager of the
Yankees, Torre said none of those challenges ``has come close to
what I dealt with in my battle against prostate cancer.'' He urged
more federal funding for prostate cancer research ``to mount a
serious attack'' on the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Milken charged that the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the
government's main cancer research arm, has neglected prostate
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   More than one million men have been diagnosed with prostate
cancer in the last six years, costing about $100 billion in
treatments, Milken said. During that time, the NIH has spent less
than 1 percent of that amount on research to find a cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there any example anywhere in private industry of a company
that would spend so much more to deal with a problem as it would to
solve a problem?'' said Milken, who was diagnosed in 1993 with
advanced prostate cancer. ``It just doesn't make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole, whose cancerous prostate was removed in 1991, also
stressed the need to boost federal prostate funding. ``We are here
to underscore the importance of research and the importance of
reaching out for new technologies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The three prostate cancer survivors appeared before the Senate
appropriations subcommittee on health.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, replied that Congress simply can't afford
to increase NIH's overall budget because of the strict spending
caps put in place by Congress and the administration in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where the money is going to come from,'' said
Stevens, also a prostate cancer survivor.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said he would study a proposal by Milken to fund
research through a cancer research bonds program, fashioned after
the war bonds effort of World Wars I and II. Milken, who founded a
prostate cancer research organization backed with his own money,
said he would buy $50 million worth of such bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Torre, who led the Yankees to two World Series championships in
1996 and 1998, praised a long-range prostate cancer research plan
released Wednesday by the NIH.
</P>
<P>
   But Torre warned that unless the program is adequately funded by
Congress, ``It's just a plan on a piece of paper and it's promise
will remain unrealized.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the blueprint, NIH wants to increase its spending
on prostate cancer research from $180 million this year to $420
million in 2003, for a total of $1.6 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   NIH said it would use the new funds for research on drugs and
other therapies. Many of these treatments would be targeted at
patients whose prostate cancer has spread beyond the gland. The
long-term survival prospects for such patients now is about five to
eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Prostate cancer is the most diagnosed non-skin cancer in the
United States and is the second leading cancer-killer of men after
lung cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates that 180,000
U.S. men will be diagnosed with the disease this year, while some
37,000 will die from it, a dip from previous years.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of these newly diagnosed prostate cancer victims will
be over 65 years old. Most of the others, like Torre, will be in
their 50s and early 60s, at the peak of their working careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an old man's disease,'' Torre said. ``The number
of men in their 40s and 50s who are battling prostate cancer is
increasing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some major medical institutions around the country are
observing a spike in the number of younger men with prostate
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, prostate cancer has been one of the most neglected
cancers in terms of federal research dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six years, the federal government _ including the
NIH and Pentagon-conducted medical research _ has invested about
$800 million in research for a cure for prostate cancer. But it has
spent $3 billion for breast cancer research over the same period
and $10 billion on AIDS, according to government figures.
</P>
<P>
   Breast and prostate cancer killed about the same number of
Americans in 1998 _ 43,900 women and 39,200 men, respectively _
while 14,000 people died from AIDs-related illnesses in the same
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that breast cancer research or AIDS research get too
much research funding,'' said Milken, who was diagnosed with
advanced prostate cancer in 1993. ``It's just that prostate cancer
research has gotten too little,'' he added.

DISNEY BRINGS NATURAL LOOK TO ANIMATION WITH NEW FILM 
 

</HEADLINE>
 TARZAN-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) If you thought ``The Lion King'' was the lord of
Disney's jungle, wait until you see ``Tarzan.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Disney studio set out to make its own version of
``Tarzan,'' opening Friday, they were dealing with one of the most
filmed characters in cinema history. It had to be true to the
Tarzan most of the world knows, yet distinctly Disney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on, we wanted to do a `Tarzan' for a contemporary
audience,'' said co-director Chris Buck.
</P>
<P>
   One difference was automatic: This was the first time Tarzan had
been made into a feature-length animated movie. For this film,
however, Disney refined its approach to animation, making
``Tarzan'' look unlike anything the studio has ever done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tarzan'' is a hand-painted movie, like classic Disney, but
uses computer help in a way completely unlike the computer-designed
``A Bug's Life'' or ``Toy Story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole new process of creating the background,'' Buck
said. ``The computer doesn't do it, we just use the computer as a
tool. We built the jungle in the computer, and painted it. So it
still looks like a painting created by hand, but you can move
around it. It allows us to move as never before, 360 degrees around
the jungle.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with three-dimensional models of the characters and even
props such as tree branches, information was digitized &QL; 
to create a 3-D version of each object. Then the objects could be
projected and painted from all sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The computer kept track of all the brush strokes, and you
could move through space,'' said Disney animator David Burgess. ``A
branch would actually exist in three dimensions, and you'd see it
twist and turn, the way it does in real life.
</P>
<P>
   ``That meant we were free. Our camera became like a Steadicam;
you could go anywhere with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The technique gives the film new realism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stylistically, it meant they couldn't look as cartoony,''
Burgess said. ``They had to be more naturalistic and work from all
points of view. If you looked at the Genie (in `Aladdin') from
certain angles, he looked bizarre. He was a cartoon. With these
characters, we had to keep them believable.''
</P>
<P>
   Making ``Tarzan'' contemporary also meant a different approach
to the characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, we said we're going to do a `Tarzan'
action-adventure,'' Buck said. ``That's the main thing. After that,
we said we can't just do action-adventure, we should have an
emotional core to the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Buck and co-director Kevin Lima went back to the book ``Tarzan
of the Apes'' and found what they were looking for. Below the
surface of Edgar Rice Burroughs' adventure story was a touching
tale of a young human trying to understand why he is so different
from his fellow apes, and eventually wondering about the strange
humans who look like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started looking for the essence of the book,'' Buck said.
``We wanted to focus more on his emotional journey and his
relationship with the animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``That became this adoption theme. `Do I belong with the people
I look like or the (apes) I love?' ''
</P>
<P>
   What surprised Buck and Lima was how well the test screenings
played to teens, usually the hardest group for Disney to reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were kind of stunned,'' Buck said. ``There's an emotional
story there they seem to hook into. There's a lot of action. They
like Tarzan, he's a cool hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the changes from the story, in many ways Disney's
``Tarzan'' comes closest to capturing the Burroughs story.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that shouldn't be a surprise. In 1936, Burroughs, who was
never really happy with Tarzan movies, considered an animated
version.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``The cartoon must be good. It must approximate
Disney excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   After 63 years, it does.

 &HT;    REMAINS OF SERB REVENGE SHOW METICULOUS BRUTALITY
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-MAIN.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   KORENICA, Kosovo _ At 68, Mark Berishe, was old enough to be
spared.
</P>
<P>
   Serb troops had told him to leave his village, Korenica, and
drive to safety on a tractor with the women and children. But, he
did not know how. ``Fine,'' they said. ``Since you can't drive a
tractor, go inside with the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Against a wall in a bedroom of his nephew's luxurious country
house, he tried pleading for mercy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aren't you humans like we are? Why are you killing us like
this? Don't you have children, too?'' Berishe asked, crossing
himself in a final act of act of Roman Catholic faith. A Serb
soldier gave him his answer: ``It's too late for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Berishe's skull, charred and cracked, sits amid rubble in
the corner of the bedroom with four other burned corpses. Nothing
but his silver tooth is recognizable.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor, hearing the account of Berishe's death from a nephew
who crawled from under the bodies to survive for a day, showed the
house to human rights workers and a few journalists Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   With Serb soldiers now out of the region under the agreement
that ended the 78-day NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia, the
veil is being lifted off one of the worst atrocities from the Serb
effort to drive ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   The killing took place April 27, apparently sparked by a
guerilla attack that left five Serb police dead a few days earlier.
The Serb revenge was sweeping, meticulous and grotesquely brutal.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights workers estimate that at least 100 and possibly 300
ethnic Albanians died. Along a 5-mile stretch of road where they
killing was the thickest, the mushy, putrid, stench of corpses
rises from loose piles of dirt.
</P>
<P>
   In the village of Meja, near Berishe's home, Serbs separated men
from a caravan of Kosovar Albanian refugees seeking safety over the
border in Albania. The Serbs apparently had trouble disposing of
all the victims they shot in a small field by the road.
</P>
<P>
   A rotting body, cut open and clad in a blue suit, lies in the
shrubs of a small ravine. A leg lies nearby, covered by pants and a
black shoe. Small personal items lie charred on the ground,
obviously the non-flammable remnants of a small fire. A Sharp Water
Sports watch is partly melted, but still ticks.
</P>
<P>
   The ravine, the small path and the fence match the description
given by the refugees who survived and are now in Albania. With the
Serbs leaving, the atrocities reported from afar are now being
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than we knew about,'' said Human Rights Watch's
Joanne Mariner. ``It's systematic. There were a lot of people
involved and it wasn't just some aberration that people were
killed. They pretty much had free reign to terrorize.''
</P>
<P>
   A Gypsy in a nearby town, 30-year-old Kurtesh Morini, said he
was forced by the Serbs to help dispose of bodies, as Gypsies are
often pressed into cleaning duties here. He said that often Serbs
took photographs and videotapes of their victims and recorded their
identities on lists and toe tags.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very organized,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the killings of April 27 seemed to tax even the Serb
efficiency. ``There is no list for Korenica,'' Morini said.
</P>
<P>
   The stately homes of Korenica are about a mile from Meja, and
two miles east of Djakovica. It was a neighborhood of some 700
people and most were Catholic Albanians, unlike the rest of the
province which is largely Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   The homes in fertile hills are now abandoned and burned, but it
is clear that they once looked like a postcard version of pastoral
Europe. They had white walls and Spanish tile roofs. Cherry trees
and yellow wildflowers grow in the lawns and many homes have sheds
for horses, cattle and chickens that now wander astray.
</P>
<P>
   Graffiti in English and Serbo-Croation is left behind by
withdrawing Serb troops. It screams obscenities at NATO and
American President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Dedaj, a 38-year-old ethnic Albanian, came back from his
mountain hideout four days ago and has gone from house to house. He
found the charred bodies of eight of his neighbors, including an
aunt and a godfather.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled that a few days before the Serb attack, Serb police
who live in the neighborhood had assured residents that they would
not face revenge for the policemen's deaths. Stay in your houses
and you will be alright, they told them.
</P>
<P>
   But, by this time, a month after NATO had started bombing and
the Serbs had stepped up their terror, there were few other
Albanians in the area. Perhaps that is why Korenica became a
target.
</P>
<P>
   Dedaj said that, the day before the Serb attack, seven buses of
Serb military, police and paramilitary troops arrived at a nearby
school. At 7:30 the next morning, they split into groups and fanned
out. Pairs of troops were stationed along the roads.
</P>
<P>
   Many wore sleeveless military shirts with red bandanas on their
arms. Some wore masks. He took his family to the top of the hill
and watched the Serbs approach the homes.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until later that night, though, that he heard what
happened to Mark Berishe. He heard it from Daniel Berishe, the
owner of the three-story, five-bedroom house and once a well-known
Kosovar soccer player.
</P>
<P>
   Astoundingly, Daniel, 40, was in the bedroom but only shot in
the leg. The other men upon him dead and he stayed still while the
Serbs laid blankets over the bodies and set them on fire.
</P>
<P>
   When the Serbs left, he escaped. With burns on his arms, he
hustled into the mountains and told the story to Dedaj. The next
morning, Serbs would find and insist on taking him away for medical
treatment. Dedaj found Daniel Berishe's body by the road a day
after that.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Dedaj walked the human rights workers around the
neighborhood. Lying in the entranceway of a house near Berishe's
are the charred remains of Dedaj's aunt, Mire Paloka.
</P>
<P>
   Her skull is cracked open exposing her burned brain. Below that
is just a twisted spine and one leg. But, Dedaj said he found her
burned rings and watch here and holds them in a dirty plastic bag.
He said his uncle's body was here, but has been taken, he's not
sure how.
</P>
<P>
   In another home, the jumbled vertebrae of an 80-year-old man lie
in a charred pile. And in another home, a few bones remain from two
men who have been buried.
</P>
<P>
   There is little property in the homes, no furniture or
appliances. Most of the interiors are burned. Occasionally, a plate
or tiny cup for sipping Turkish coffee can be seen among the
shattered roof tiles.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the items in the homes and sheds outside seem to have
been carefully dismantled or removed.
</P>
<P>
   The surviving families have fled to Europe or Albania. Dedaj's
wife and five children are in Albania. A short, muscular farmer
with chiseled features, Dedaj said he cried at the sight of his
neighbors and relatives, but he would like to go to Europe, make
some money and rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we can never be satisfied with our lives. But what
can we do?'' he said. ``The living people must go on living.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was Nickelodeon's 20th-anniversary party at the
Museum of Television and Radio here in May, but Herb Scannell, the
chief executive of the children's TV network, promised to be brief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Nick fan,'' he told revelers, using his network's
nickname, ``but I'm also a Knicks fan,'' meaning he wanted to get
home to watch the Knicks-Pacers game. Wrapping up his remarks five
minutes later, he thanked Geraldine Laybourne, his celebrated
predecessor. As he lauded her ``inspiration and vision,'' his voice
quivered and his eyes filled with tears.
</P>
<P>
   It was vintage Scannell: deferential, almost self-effacing; the
quintessential No. 2 guy.
</P>
<P>
   Except that he has been No. 1 for three years now, and has built
Nickelodeon, a division of Viacom Inc.'s MTV Networks, into a $1
billion multimedia powerhouse. When he took over from Ms.
Laybourne, few thought he would do much more than stay the course
she had set. Today, his detractors at the network, some of whom now
work elsewhere, know better. So do Nickelodeon's rivals, who had
hoped that Scannell would stumble.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he has taken Nickelodeon into animated feature films,
high-volume licensing and merchandising, digital cable channels, an
educational television partnership, Web sites and overseas
expansion, all the while reaping more than half of all advertising
dollars spent on children's television.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, he has nearly doubled Nickelodeon's revenue and
profits. And the doubters have learned an important lesson about
Scannell: Beneath his boyish face and mild-mannered demeaner lurks
the same hypercompetitive personality that drives those Knicks and
Mets ballplayers he admires so much.
</P>
<P>
   When he heard in the summer of 1997 that ``Teletubbies,'' the
quirky British show for toddlers, was coming to the United States,
he summoned his executive troops together to plan a counterattack.
Never mind that the 'Tubbies were going to be shown on PBS, a
noncommercial channel, and that nobody really knew how popular they
would be; Scannell ordered everyone to find ways to pump up the
promotion and marketing of ``Blue's Clues,'' Nickelodeon's year-old
computer-amimated educational show.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us, `Regardless of what they do, we have to be as
aggressive as we can,''' Cyma Zarghami, Nickelodeon's executive
vice president and general manager, said. Scannell even managed to
get a balloon of Blue, the show's star dog, into the Macy's
Thanksgiving Parade in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is extremely competitive,'' said Viacom's chairman Sumner
Redstone. But, he added, ``He's quietly competitive. You don't have
to shout to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you are too quiet, people may not realize
you're a fighter. That was Scannell's problem in 1996. He had
toiled in the shadow of the charismatic Ms. Laybourne, a
combination Pied Piper and business shark who, in 17 years, had
made Nickelodeon not only the most popular children's network in
America but also the most popular cable network, period.
</P>
<P>
   Associates remember how Ms. Laybourne sometimes unleashed a
temper that matched her passion for her work. By contrast, Scannell
came across as an amiable and thoughtful logistics specialist who
rarely even raised his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question, my reaction and that of a lot other industry
people was, `Can he fill her shoes?''' said Jack Irving, executive
vice president and media director for the advertising agency
Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi New York. ``People felt he was a
behind-the-scenes kind of guy. People thought he would have a tough
time.''
</P>
<P>
   So did his superiors. Scannell's background was in programming
and marketing, and they wondered whether he had the financial
expertise or strategic vision to lead Nickelodeon into the 21st
century. MTV Networks president Tom Freston actually moved into Ms.
Laybourne's office for six weeks, acting as president and
evaluating Scannell's every move.
</P>
<P>
   One thing he found was that Nickelodeon's successful ``zigzag''
strategy, as it is called inside the network, came straight from
Scannell's gut. ``When others zig, we zag,'' Ms. Zarghami said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Scannell had the idea of making Saturday night a
special night for children's variety programs, calling it
``Snick,'' for Saturday Night Nick.'' And, with Saturday morning
hours the stronghold of the broadcast networks, he suggested using
Sunday mornings to premiere Nickelodeon's cartoons. ``He didn't
just step in and inherit something,'' Ms. Laybourne pointed out.
``He inherited his own hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   Scannell, 42, said many of his best ideas come to him at home,
an apartment in lower Manhattan where he lives with his wife,
Sarah, and their 4-year-old daughter, Caroline.
</P>
<P>
   And though a company car could be at his disposal, Scannell
takes the subway to work. ``Only three stops on the express
train,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   One of his first moves as head of Nickelodeon was to challenge
the two powerhouses of children's animation, Walt Disney Co. and
Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Brothers. He persuaded his bosses to
invest $350 million to build an animation studio in Burbank,
Calif., that now has five series and four feature films in
production for Nickelodeon, and some direct-to-video films in
development.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Nickelodeon's first animated feature film, ``The Rugrats
Movie'' _ made last fall in partnership with Viacom's Paramount
Pictures and Arlene Klasky and Gabor Csupo, creators of the popular
``Rugrats'' television show _ became the first non-Disney animated
film to gross more than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the licensing and merchandising division of
Nickelodeon has mushroomed in the last three years into a $100
million business, largely on the strength of characters from
``Rugrats'' and ``Blue's Clues.''
</P>
<P>
   Scannell also took advantage of the broadcast networks' shift
toward filling the 8 p.m. time slot with sexy sitcoms and other
adult fare. Since 1985, Nickelodeon from 8 p.m. on had been showing
classic sitcoms like ``The Brady Bunch'' and ``I Love Lucy'' under
the promotional banner ``Nick at Nite.'' But in October 1996,
Scannell moved children's shows into the 8-to-8:30 slot, and in
1998, he expanded them into the next half-hour. The moves worked:
more children watch Nickelodeon between 8 and 9 p.m. than watch any
other network, even though the broadcasters reach 99.4 million
homes, compared with Nickelodeon's 75 million.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Scannell again caught his rivals off guard. They had
expected Nickelodeon to announce an educational channel. What they
failed to foresee was that he would launch it in partnership with
the best-known name in educational television, the Children's
Television Workshop, producers of ``Sesame Street'' and other
highly praised public television shows. The result was a
commercial-free educational channel called Noggin, which began in
February.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt putting us together was like one plus one equals
three,'' Scannell said. ``It would be building a new model that has
its own strength, rather than have two independent guns going at
each other and turning it into a shootout that would cost everyone
a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Noggin has already become one of the channels most sought after
by cable operators. So has Nickelodeon GAS (short for Games and
Sports), another spinoff.
</P>
<P>
   Through all his maneuverings, Scannell has taken advantage of an
almost total recall of television history that gives him a gut
instinct on how audiences will react to new shows. He even uses TV
lore to describe his parents. His father was a social worker in
Harlem and later in Suffolk County, where he and his three older
siblings grew up, and his mother was a Puerto Rico-born caseworker
for Catholic Charities. ``My mother and father were like Ricky and
Lucy, only in reverse,'' he said, referring to Lucille Ball and her
Cuban husband, Ricky Ricardo, on ``I Lovy Lucy.''
</P>
<P>
   When Scannell got the chief executive's job, according to
Nickelodeon chief operating officer Jeffrey Dunn, he gave himself a
crash course in his weakest area, finances, constantly pestering
Dunn with questions while pushing his department heads to set
higher goals. ``This is where the competitive streak served him
well,'' Dunn said. ``For Herb, it wasn't just, `How does this
work?' but `How are we going to win, how are we going to make take
it to the next level?' It was empowering.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone thought so, though. Since he took over, eight
high-level executives have left, including the heads of marketing,
licensing and the movie division, as well as Rich Cronin, who had
been running the spinoff channel TV Land, who left to head the Fox
Family Channel.
</P>
<P>
   One former executive, who insisted on anonymity, said Scannell
had set unrealistically steep financial goals for some departments,
trying to goad certain managers to become more competitive. This
person said that if the network's advertising executive had not
locked up advertisers to two- and three-year deals in 1997, the
network might have seen a drop in ad revenue this year as its
Nielsen ratings dropped slightly.
</P>
<P>
   But the network, and most advertising agencies, attribute that
loss of market share to increased competition from the Cartoon
Network and, to a lesser extent, the Disney Channel and the Fox
Family Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Another executive, still on board but also speaking on condition
of anonymity, said some veteran department heads simply did not
respond well to the higher challenges Scannell had set for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made people deliver,'' Ms. Zarghami, the network's general
manager, said. ``The ones who were delivering were the ones who
stayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Scannell still has his critics within management ranks, though
they understandably decline to speak for attribution. Some say
that, compared with Ms. Laybourne, he is a micromanager, while
others grouse that his drive to increase sales is putting at risk
Ms. Laybourne's mantra, ``Kids first.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, the week before the ``Rugrats'' movie was released
last November, Nickelodeon removed the show from its 7:30 p.m. time
slot, and ran a promotional spot saying ``The Rugrats have gone to
Hollywood, but they'll be back at their normal time next Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parents complained that their children had been
disappointed not to see the show. Other resented the gimmick,
which, naturally, led many children to ask ``What's Hollywood?''
and then, ``Can I go see the movie?'' But the move did help sell
tickets, bolstering Nickelodeon's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom does not report Nickelodeon's results separately. But
cable analysts at Paul Kagan Associates, a media consulting firm,
project revenue of $865 million at Nickelodeon's domestic network
this year, up from $570 million in 1996, and $431 million in cash
flow, a measure of profit, compared with $291 million three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   When ancillary businesses and Nickelodeon's international
earnings are added (it has channels in Latin America, Britain,
parts of Europe, Australia, Japan, Indonesia and South Africa), the
division is expected to earn about $500 million on revenue of
nearly $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Moran, who follows Viacom for ING Baring Furman Selz, said
Nickelodeon was ``probably the fastest-growing established,
nonstartup, media-related entity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street's focus with Viacom has been on whether
Blockbuster would turn around, or on the performance of the studio,
driven by `Titanic' and other successful movies,'' Moran added.
``But the quiet, always predictable leading performer among
Viacom's assets is without question Nickelodeon.''

 &HT;    GULF WAR VICTIMS SEEN NINE TIMES LESS LIKELY TO HAVE PROTECTIVE
GENE
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Victims of the controversial ``Gulf War Syndrome''
are nine times more likely than their healthy comrades to have a
genetic defect that makes them vulnerable to chemical warfare
agents and similar substances, researchers in Texas and Michigan
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The finding adds evidence to support the often-disputed theory
that soldiers who mysteriously came down with a variety of mental,
cognitive and behavioral disorders after serving in the 1991
Persian Gulf War suffered from exposure to substances such as sarin
nerve gas and organophosphate pesticides, the scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have identified a gene that predisposes soldiers to Gulf
War Syndrome,'' said Robert W. Haley, an epidemiologist at the
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gene is important because it determines your level of a
blood enzyme that protects you from nerve gas, particularly
sarin,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The nerve agents also include a number of common pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Haley said Gulf War veterans who were exposed to the substances
and were blessed with high levels of the protective enzyme were
significantly less likely to develop the syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   He said a follow-up study will attempt to compare the genetic
differences with the incidence of the fatal wasting
</P>
<P>
   disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also called Lou Gehrig's
disease, among become Gulf War veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Haley and two researchers from the University of Michigan
Medical School published the results of their study in the
scientific journal, Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest questions about Gulf War Syndrome has been
why one person got sick when the person next to him didn't,'' Haley
said. ``That is one of the major puzzles that made many people
think the symptoms were just due to stress.''
</P>
<P>
   After comparing blood samples from 26 victims of Gulf War
Syndrome with 20 healthy veterans, Haley and Michigan researchers
Scott Billecke and Bert N. La Du (CQ), said they found a
significant correlation between the disease and the inability to
produce high blood levels of an enzyme called Q paraoxonase, known
by its biochemical nickname, PON-Q.
</P>
<P>
   Other studies of the effect of organophosphate poisons on the
nervous system have concentrated on levels of a different enzyme,
pseudocholinsesterase.
</P>
<P>
   Haley said PON-Q is a more powerful neutralizer of the poisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just floats around in the blood, chewing up organphosphate
poisons,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   However, the gene that directs the production of PON-Q differs
slightly in different people, he said, and some of the differences
have been shown to lead to lower levels of the enzyme.
</P>
<P>
   The enzyme, which coincidentally is transported in the blood
stream by the ``good'' cholesterol, high density lipoprotein, or
HDL, has been studied in connection with other conditions for many
years, Haley said.
</P>
<P>
   He said his study showed that veterans who are among the most
severely impaired victims of the syndrome are nine times more
likely than healthy soldiers to be in the 25 percent of the
population with the lowest levels of PON-Q.
</P>
<P>
   Haley has become one of the leading scientific proponents of the
view that Gulf War Syndrome is a specific organic disease, rather
than a collection of similar but unrelated symptoms, most of which
could be explained only by ``stress.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, he and a group of other researchers from the Dallas
center published a set of three papers in the Journal of the
American Medical Association, concluding that some Gulf War
veterans suffer from brain damage most likely caused by exposure to
chemical agents during the Gulf War.

SENATE APPROVES BILL TO HELP DISABLED RETURN TO WORKPLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Wednesday unanimously approved
legislation to make it easier for people with AIDS and other
disabilities to return to work without losing federal health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a glitch: Lawmakers in both the House and Senate
have yet to figure out how to pay for the popular proposal, which
would cost $800 million over five years. The Senate legislation
sidestepped the issue for now, saying the cost would have to be
paid for by cutting other programs.
</P>
<P>
   More than 7.5 million disabled Americans receive cash and health
care benefits through Social Security disability programs, but many
of them are reluctant to get a job because that could mean losing
their health coverage. Only one-half of 1 percent of those people
leave the disability rolls to return to work, the government says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous that we punish disabled persons who dare to
take a job by penalizing them financially by taking away their
health insurance lifeline,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
one of the lead sponsors of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy predicted that the 99 to 0 in the Senate would provide
momentum for the House to approve legislation, which is popular
with both Republicans and Democrats because it encourages disabled
people to get jobs. The House Commerce Committee has approved
similar legislation, but it must go through the tax-writing Ways
and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. James M. Jeffords, R-Vt., also a primary author of the
bill, said the current law erects ``an insane barrier'' for
disabled people who want to return to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about big government,'' said Senate Finance
Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del. ``It's about getting
government out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would allow disabled people who receive Social
Security Disability Insurance to retain health coverage for up to
six years, up from the current 39 months.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would allow states to expand Medicaid coverage for
working disabled people who would share the cost of the premiums,
paying more as they earn more.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, moreover, gives disabled people greater access to
job training and employment placement. It also would gradually
phase out Social Security cash benefits to disabled people who go
to work, rather than suddenly cutting them off.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton lobbied for the legislation in his State of
the Union message in January. A slimmer version of the bill passed
the House last year but died in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he hopes to have the bill on his desk by July
26, the ninth anniversary of the signing of the Americans with
Disabilities Act, the landmark legislation designed to increase
access for people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Cox, a senior legislative staffer with the advocacy group
AIDS Action, said the legislation would ``ease the minds and fears
of people with disabilities.'' Cox said many people with AIDS who
have benefited from new medicines fear that if they return to work,
they will eventually lose the federal health insurance that pays
for their treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Marty Ford, co-chair of the Consortium for Citizens with
Disabilities, a coalition of national disability organizations,
said the legislation would ``remove some of the substantial
barriers that keep people with disabilities from working.''

IN TOKYO RED-LIGHT ZONE, CHINESE GANGSTERS DISPLACE JAPANESE
RIVALS

 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In the northwest of Tokyo is an area of a dozen square
blocks that wakes up at noon and parties till dawn, where gamblers
and gangsters run rings around the police, where prostitutes and
strippers undress for success, where the curses and quarrels are in
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The area is Kabukicho, Japan's largest ``entertainment zone,''
as it is politely called, and these days it is a reflection of
Japan's troubles in competing with China and other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
   For the same reasons that Nissan and Hitachi are in trouble _
high labor costs and inflexible management _ the bars and brothels
of Kabukicho are passing into Chinese hands. Even the yakuza, the
Japanese gangsters who see themselves as the toughest businessmen,
are being driven out by shrewder and more ruthless Chinese gangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest problem is the rise of the Chinese mafia,'' one
yakuza lamented. ``The Chinese gangs are taking business from us in
every area _ in prostitution, in gambling, in fencing stolen
goods.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between us is that Japanese yakuza think of
long-term business relationships, but the Chinese mafia thinks just
of the short-term,'' he added, in a remark strangely reminiscent of
what Japanese industrialists often say. ``Their only goal is money,
money, money.''
</P>
<P>
   Still bickering and distrustful because of the legacy of World
War II, Japan and China compete for markets and influence around
Asia. In the last half-dozen years, Japanese have become
increasingly nervous about the possibility of being sidelined by
the behemoth next door. Many Chinese and Japanese alike believe
that Japan's dikes are crumbling and that in another decade there
will be several times as many Chinese in Japan as today _ for this
is where the money is to be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us like Japanese men,'' said a 25-year-old Chinese
woman from Shanghai who acknowledged working as a prostitute in
Kabukicho for the last year. ``They're so different from Chinese
people. They're cold, and we're warm. They like distance, and we
like to be close. I wouldn't choose them for pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is business,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   She has overcome the language barrier and prospered because,
like many of the immigrants, she is well educated and fiercely
ambitious. She takes classes in Japanese and English during the
day, then goes to work in the hostess bar and nearby ``love
hotels'' from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough, but I'm making a lot more money than I did in
China,'' she said. ``With the money, I hope I can go to the United
States. I have some relatives in Florida, in a city called Miami.
That's where I'd like to go next.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite extremely strict immigration rules for Chinese, their
numbers in Japan are surging. The official figure for the Chinese
population in Japan has risen to 252,000, from 95,000 a decade ago,
and this does not include the tens of thousands who are here
illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Chinese are engineers, software designers and
investment bankers, but those immigrants tend to live scattered
around Tokyo and attract little attention. It is the thousands of
gangsters and prostitutes clustered in Kabukicho who have become
notorious throughout Japan, inflaming anxieties and hostilities
toward Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Kabukicho's image in Japan as a Chinese enclave where
gangsters hack each other with cleavers, it still seems by American
standards a surprisingly tame and safe area. It is the kind of
red-light district that would have emerged from the paintbrush of
Norman Rockwell.
</P>
<P>
   The streets are well lighted and spotless, pimps sometimes wear
neckties and clean-cut barkers ask men to step inside, ``Please.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of everything, Kabukicho is still a Japanese place,''
said Mark Schreiber, an American in Tokyo who has taken an interest
in Kabukicho for more than 30 years and is researching a book on
the area. ``In Southeast Asia, you might get knocked on the head,
but you know it's not going to happen here _ because this is
Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one killing in Kabukicho has occurred so far this year _
one Chinese man stabbed another in a karaoke parlor _ and graffiti
and muggings are almost unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're honest, nobody bothers you in Kabukicho,'' said a
Shanghai restaurateur who was lured to Japan by the money and says
she has no troubles with the gangs. ``It's the no-good types who
fight each other, who get kidnapped, who get in trouble. The hoods
just feed off the hoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan has had red-light districts since ancient times, long
before there were red lights. Prostitution was made illegal only in
the 1950s, and even now it is regarded by many Japanese as less
felonious than jaywalking.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Originally Kabukicho was a purely Japanese-run area, but in the
1980s, Taiwanese steadily took over the bars and clubs in the area
and began to bring in young women from China to work as
``hostesses.'' The Chinese invasion picked up speed in the 1990s,
and Taiwanese or Chinese establishments replaced Japanese
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Now the grocery stores in Kabukicho offer Shanghai newspapers
and Chinese specialties like live eels and turtles. Some of Japan's
best (and cheapest) Chinese restaurants are in Kabukicho, and
families regularly stroll with small children past the strip
parlors for Cantonese noodles or Shanghai dumplings.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the ``bubble economy'' hurt Japan's huge sex
industry, and government statistics say the number of sex-related
businesses has fallen to 12,200, from 14,200 in 1989. But Chinese
bars and brothels pay employees less and are able to thrive despite
the recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, if you work hard, then you can make money and get
ahead,'' said a 27-year-old doctor from Harbin in northeastern
China, a tall woman who has worked as a prostitute here for only a
few months. ``The Japanese complain about unemployment, but there's
good money to be made here. You just have to be willing to work
hard and take the tough jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my way to get ahead in life,'' she added. ``I'll live
the rest of my life here. Or maybe I'll go to the States.''
</P>
<P>
   She and others said immigration restrictions are simply a minor
inconvenience. Some of the women enter Japan as university students
or after ``marrying'' a Japanese man in exchange for a few thousand
dollars, while others sneak in by boat or use fake or stolen
passports arranged by Chinese gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese in Kabukicho have also prospered by making a science of
indulging their drunken Japanese customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a guest complains, immediately refund him his money,''
states Rule 29 on a four-page list that one Taiwan bar owner
circulates among her prostitutes. ``If any girl gets three
complaints, she must immediately resign.''
</P>
<P>
   The list of rules, which is supposed to be confidential,
stipulates that the women must smile and wear makeup at all times.
Any woman caught chewing gum gets an $80 fine. Asking a customer
for a tip is a firing offense, and a system of bonuses and
penalties creates incentives for the prostitutes to fawn over the
customers in the bar and in bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a customer sings karaoke, please, everyone clap,'' states
Rule 37. ``This is compulsory.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese gangs prospered partly because they have been quicker
than Japanese crooks to adopt high technology, like equipment to
forge passports and make fake magnetic-strip cards that fool
pachinko-game arcades and allow the user to play and win prizes.
Chinese mobsters also won business by charging low prices _offering
contract killings, for example, starting at just $2,700.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese mafia is very, very good at business,'' the
Japanese yakuza said. ``Whether in fake magnetic cards or fencing
stolen goods, they go about things with a real system. They are
very serious about making money.''
</P>
<P>
   The yakuza complained that Chinese gangsters _ whom he referred
to using a derogatory Japanese expression equivalent to ``dogs'' _
are multiplying wildly and are so brazen that they have taken to
robbing Japanese mobsters at knifepoint or gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Japanese yakuza, the most important thing is staying
alive, and making money is second,'' the yakuza said. ``But for the
Chinese gangsters, the first thing is money. The second thing is
money. And the third thing is money.''
</P>
<P>
   In December the police formed a special 101-member force to
crack down on foreign crimes, especially in Kabukicho, but it seems
to have made little headway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know how the Japanese gangs work, because they've always
been in Kabukicho,'' Taiichi Kawasaki, the head of the force, said
in an interview in police headquarters. (The location of the
force's Kabukicho offices is a secret.) ``But it's difficult to
figure out how the foreign gangs work.''
</P>
<P>
   Few Chinese think that the crackdown on Kabukicho will succeed
or will stem the tide of Chinese migrants, but even some of those
engaged in shady businesses seem to welcome a greater police
presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gangs are out of control,'' a Chinese pimp fretted as he
stood on the street late one evening. ``They kidnap anybody who's
Chinese and hold them until they get money, and sometimes they hurt
them. If it's a girl, they rape her and take her bank card and
force her to tell the PIN number. She's usually not legal, so she
can't go to the cops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese community is living in fear.''

   Named in a lavish CBS special Tuesday night, the AFI's top 25
male and female screen legends shouldn't spark the fire of
controversy lit by last year's AFI list of the top 100 American
films.
</P>
<P>
   Then, classic pictures such as ``East of Eden'' were excluded
while recent hits such as ``Pulp Fiction'' were included, to name
but one quibble. (Don't get us started.)
</P>
<P>
   But the AFI's roster of 50 screen legends is filled with obvious
choices, from No. 1 Humphrey Bogart, No. 2 Cary Grant and No. 9
Spencer Tracy among the males to No. 1 Katharine Hepburn, No. 4
Ingrid Bergman and No. 5 Greta Garbo among the women.
</P>
<P>
   Who can argue with those? Such performers are undeniably
legendary, whether the AFI calls them that or not.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say omitted stars don't merit legendary status,
from Errol Flynn, Douglas Fairbanks and Frank Sinatra to Lana
Turner, Gloria Swanson and Olivia de Havilland.
</P>
<P>
   Probably more debate will arise over such omissions than over
who made the short list.
</P>
<P>
   Other disputes could concern numerical rankings (John Wayne over
Laurence Olivier? Grace Kelly over Vivien Leigh?) and the AFI's
weird, gerrymander-style rules.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, entry was limited to actors who made their
American screen debut before 1951. But the AFI's rules also had
catches, although it turns out these served only the nominees for
whom they seem intended.
</P>
<P>
   By including ``teams of actors,'' the AFI was able to honor the
Marx Brothers en masse (Laurel &AMP; Hardy lost out), whereas Groucho,
Harpo, Chico or Zeppo never would have been named individually.
</P>
<P>
   By including actors who hit the screen after 1950 but who have
since died, the AFI was able to honor James Dean.
</P>
<P>
   Dean certainly belongs on any list with William Holden, Marlon
Brando and Marilyn Monroe, who also are known chiefly for work
after Hollywood's golden era of the 1930s and '40s.
</P>
<P>
   AFI historians' first list of 500 nominees also acknowledged
John Belushi, Elvis Presley, Steve McQueen and even Divine _
``late'' in the mortal as well as the chronological sense.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, none of those made the final list, which was voted
upon by 1,800 filmmakers, critics, historians and cultural leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The ``pre-1951 unless you're dead'' rule rightly ruled out
current or recent favorites (Tom Cruise, Julia Roberts) for
legendary status.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it meant no-brainer legends such as Jack Nicholson,
Paul Newman, Jack Lemmon, Barbra Streisand, Jane Fonda and Meryl
Streep could not be included. Perhaps their turn will come at the
end of the next century.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, of the AFI's 50 legends, 41 are deceased, and
the living are largely inactive as actors.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``American'' is slapped all over the rules, but the
honor wasn't limited to American actors.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the AFI embraced actors who made ``a significant screen
presence in American feature-length films.'' That opened the doors
to the European-born Olivier, Grant, Bergman, Leigh, Sophia Loren,
Audrey Hepburn and others.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of Audrey Hepburn should be gratified that she was ranked
so highly at No. 3, behind only Katharine Hepburn and Bette Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Others may bemoan that Fred Astaire, while a beloved star, was
No. 5 among males, ahead of Clark Gable at No. 6 and Charles
Chaplin at No. 10. Sidney Poitier, at No. 22, was the only
African-American on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Orson Welles is an odd choice to be among the actors, ranking
No. 16.
</P>
<P>
   The honor seems to have been given largely on the strength of
one film, ``Citizen Kane.'' Welles wrote, directed and starred in
that movie, the highest-ranked movie in the AFI's Top 100 list of
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Kelly at No. 15 also seems to have been honored more as a
director, dancer and choreographer than as an actor, a role for
which he wasn't widely heralded.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the AFI could be defining ``actor'' as anyone who
performs on the screen, with popularity also taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   All of these 50 are undeniably great stars, and it's stardom
that begets legendary status, not necessarily acting chops.
Otherwise, top 500 nominees such as Paul Muni or Frances Farmer
might have made the final list.
</P>
<P>
   Peter O'Toole's character in ``My Favorite Year'' made the
proper distinction, even if the AFI does not. ``I'm not an actor!''
he yelled when forced to perform on live television. ``I'm a movie
star!''
</P>
<P>
   As for current stars who weren't eligible, 50 were seen on the
CBS special Tuesday night, which was intended as an honor in
itself. Starting today, many video stores across America will be
honoring those 50 stars and AFI's 50 legends by featuring at least
one film from the careers of all 100.

 &HT;    REBUILDING KOSOVO FOCUS OF CLINTON MEETING WITH FRANCE'S CHIRAC
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-MAIN-0617.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ President Clinton meets with his French counterpart,
Jacques Chirac, on Thursday for talks on how to divvy up the costs
of rebuilding war-ravaged Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In his first official meeting with a European head of state
since NATO ended its bombing campaign against Yugoslavia last week,
Clinton will reiterate that it's up to Europe to foot the lion's
share of the reconstruction tab.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will acknowledge the importance of the European Union
taking the lead,'' said Mike Hammer, a spokesman for Clinton's
National Security Council. ``But the president will also
acknowledge that we need to do our part as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of Balkans reconstruction is expected to dominate
talks Friday when Clinton and Chirac meet with the leaders from
five other largest industrial democracies -- the so-called Group of
Seven -- in Cologne, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was scheduled to travel to Cologne Thursday, after his
meeting with Chirac.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, accompanied by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and
their daughter, Chelsea, arrived here Wednesday after first
traveling to Geneva, Switzerland to present a speech on global
child labor abuses to the International Labour Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, whose efforts to expand global trade have been
criticized by labor groups in the United States, lent his support
to an ILO convention aimed at providing new protections for the
estimated 250 million children under the age of 14 that are working
in developing countries, often under dangerous and exploitative
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has asked Congress for $35 million this year for
programs aimed at boosting minimum labor standards in developing
countries. On Saturday, he signed an executive order aimed at
shutting out from U.S. government purchases any products made using
abusive child labor practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things we cannot and will not tolerate,''
Clinton said Wednesday. ``We will not tolerate children being used
in pornography and prostitution. We will not tolerate children in
slavery or bondage. We will not tolerate children being forcibly
recruited to serve in armed conflicts.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Clinton, ``These are not some archaic practices out of a
Charles Dickens novel. These are things that happen in too many
places today.''
</P>
<P>
   After arriving in Paris Wednesday afternoon, Clinton and Chirac
had a private dinner at a Paris restaurant and were scheduled to
meet Thursday morning at Elysee Palace.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders were slated to hold a brief press conference after
their meeting, which will likely also touch on a U.S.-French trade
dispute involving beef and bananas and the future of oil sanctions
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   France wants the United Nations mandate for the sanctions
lifted. Clinton contends the sanctions -- which limit Iraq's oil
exports -- are essential to constraining Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's military machine.
</P>
<P>
   The short-term reconstruction needs in Kosovo are expected to
cost some $3 billion. Coming up with that money is an urgent
priority. An enormous amount of basic rebuilding -- bridges, roads,
shelter, utilities systems -- must precede the return of the bulk
of the 850,000 ethnic Albanians who fled their homes inside Kosovo
and took refuge in neighboring Macedonia and Albania.

CHINA ARRESTS TWO WHO LED FARMERS' PROTEST THAT POLICE CRUSHED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Five months after riot policemen violently dispersed a
huge demonstration by angry farmers in the southern province of
Hunan, two of the farmers' leaders have been arrested and charged
with serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders, Yang Yaojin and Hu Zhiping, had been fugitives
since the demonstration in Daolin township on Jan. 8. On that day,
thousands of villagers gathered to condemn what they said were
illegal taxes and corruption on the part of local Communist Party
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of police officers dispersed the crowd with tear gas
and clubs. One man was killed by an exploding tear gas canister,
and scores were wounded, according to witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration appears to have been one of the largest of
many similar protests reported from rural areas in recent years, as
discontent simmers over official corruption, high taxes and low
grain prices.
</P>
<P>
   Since the confrontation, police had sought several leaders of
the two-year-old illegal farmer association that had mobilized
local villagers. But the men were sheltered by neighbors in the
hilly villages surrounding Daolin.
</P>
<P>
   Early on the morning of June 11, according to two local
residents who spoke on condition of anonymity, police arrested Yang
and Hu. A third organizer of the farmers, Cui Luokun, was not at
home when police broke down the door, and remains in hiding.
</P>
<P>
   On June 12, Chen Lixiang, the Communist Party secretary of
Ningxiang County, which includes Daolin, visited the town and
called a meeting of local officials. He told them that Yang and Hu
had been charged with ``assaulting the government'' and ``holding
illegal rallies,'' according to the local residents.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers still cling to the hope that the Beijing authorities
would support their cause if they only knew the facts, the
residents said. But since January they have been afraid to make any
public protests.
</P>
<P>
   Top officials in Beijing have spoken out against excess taxes
levied by the township and county authorities, and against official
``wining and dining'' with farmers' hard-won earnings. But they
have been frightened by worker and farmer protests and seem
determined to crush independent organizations.
</P>
<P>
   A Hong Kong human rights group reported this week that a total
of nine farmers in Ningxiang County had recently been charged in
connection with January's demonstration, in a list that included
Yang but not Hu. Daolin residents said that only those two had been
arrested from their township and that they were unaware of further
arrests in neighboring areas, but they could not rule them out.
</P>
<P>
   In another typical instance of rural discontent, reported by the
same Hong Kong group, on Monday about 150 farmers held a sit-down
protest at the provincial headquarters of Fujian province in
Fuzhou.
</P>
<P>
   They were protesting inadequate compensation and corruption in a
government takeover of their land, according to the Hong Kong-based
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in
China. The farmers left peacefully after meeting with officials,
according to the report.

</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-REFUGEES (Vermitca) _ More than 12,000 cheering, stunned
Albanians begin their journey home, in the first big wave of a
reverse exodus of refugees who were driven from Kosovo in a Serbian
campaign of terror. Their departure created the kind of chaos for
refugee agencies that aid workers had feared. By mid-afternoon, the
line of honking, over-loaded cars, trucks and tractors up the
crumbling road out of Albania toward this Kosovo border village was
five miles long. By Elisabeth Bumiller.

set up a tent where his house once stood. By John Kifner.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-RDP (Patres) _ Developments: The Kosovo Liberation Army's
leaders have pledged to cooperate with NATO's peacekeepers, but so
far they have not shown much inclination to break up their
insurgency _ just as it has become the dominant political and
military force among Kosovo's Albanians.In the most serious of a
series of confrontations between NATO troops and the KLA, American
marines with helicopter gunships overhead confiscate the weapons of
more than 100 of the insurgents and detain six of their leaders. By
Steven Lee Myers.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-GRAVES (Koronice) _ For the last four days, Tom Dedaj has
been going house to house in search of the unburied horrors of
Kosovo. They are not hard to find. A severed foot lies on the grass
of the cemetery. Three doors down from his house, the charred
bodies of five friends are strewn in a rubble-filled room. His own
aunt lies, a mass of lumps and ashes, in her front hallway. Today,
he took a lawyer with Human Rights Watch on a tour of what he had
found, as Kosovo's tragedy entered its next phase: documenting
exactly what has happened since March with an eye toward punishing
the guilty. By Ian Fisher.

   KOSOVO-PRISTINA (Pristina) _ The arrival of NATO-led forces has
brought Kosovo's Albanians to city streets and rural lanes to

Pristina, the Kosovo capital. Here, with some Serbian police and
military personnel still present, the mood is tentative, wary and

KING COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT CATCHES BIG WAVE OF HAWAIIAN
OFFICERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VANESSA HO  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Don't be surprised if you see King County sheriff's
deputies eating an island-style ``plate lunch'' instead of the
proverbial doughnut.
</P>
<P>
   The Sheriff's Office is reaping what it sowed in the Hawaiian
sun last year, when it recruited a huge number of island cops
unhappy with low pay and high cost of living there.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Sheriff Dave Reichert swore in five former Honolulu
officers who are part of an unprecedented wave of Hawaiians joining
Western Washington departments.
</P>
<P>
   Like many agencies, the Sheriff's Office has been struggling
with hiring in a tight job market. Last year, county and Washington
State Patrol recruiters traveled west to lure candidates. This
year, Reichert is expanding some units and replacing retirees in
hiring a record 175 people.
</P>
<P>
   The county has hired 17 Hawaiian officers and plans to hire
seven more in July. On Tuesday, the department celebrated the
swearing-in of their colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of living has escalated so much there,'' said Jesse
Barbuta, who had been with Honolulu Police for more than 11 years
and was sworn in Tuesday. ``I couldn't let my wife and children
suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Earl Yamane, who spent more than four years on the
Honolulu force, said he came here this spring, after he missed his
rent three times on a cramped, $900-a-month duplex in a bad
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't afford it,'' said Yamane, who now works in the
Kenmore precinct. ``It's a $10,000 pay raise here. What I make now
is what I made with overtime in Hawaii.''
</P>
<P>
   So many Hawaiians have relocated here that they have their own
association, the Northwest Maka'i Ohana, which means ``police
family.'' Every year its 200 members _ both officers and their
families _ hold a luau with kalua pig and lomi-lomi salmon. It
celebrates its 11th anniversary this year, and has its own Web
page, which allows homesick officers to glimpse Waikiki in ``real
time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what these guys are going through,'' said Les Wong, a
Kent police officer who left the Honolulu police in 1980 in search
of a cheaper place to live. ``It's a huge change in culture,
weather and food.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the officers hear about King County and Kent through
established officers such as Wong, whom they jokingly refer to as
``the Godfather.''
</P>
<P>
   The starting salary for a King County deputy without police
experience is $3,040 a month, compared with $2,548 in Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   Pay in Honolulu isn't getting much better, where a 1 percent
raise this year has created still more dissension.
</P>
<P>
   Things are so bad, officers here said, that many Honolulu
sergeants are giving up rank for entry-level patrol jobs in other
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The floodgates have opened,'' said Tom Clark, a Honolulu
officer of five years who joined the Kent police department in
February. ``Everybody is leaving there. There's going to be a huge
amount of people coming over.''
</P>
<P>
   But relocating comes with sacrifices. Clark said he moved here
in January, leaving an island of endless sun for a depressing
Northwest winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would walk outside at 4 in the afternoon, and it would be
dark, and I thought, `Oh geez, what am I doing here?' But long
term, this was the best decision I could make.''
</P>
<P>
   The large network of Hawaiians in the Northwest has comforted
his longing for the islands, he said, and he often gets a ``plate
lunch'' _ a traditional Hawaiin meal of rice, meat and macaroni
salad _ from a Kent eatery run by a couple from Maui.

HASEK STRETCHES THE NORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Be it his blocker, his glove, his stick, his
Slinky for a spine, Dominik Hasek is expected to lead the Buffalo
Sabres. They count on their star Czech netminder to lead the
charge, as much as anyone can lead a charge when his first priority
is to stand in front of 24 square feet of open net and turn back
whatever comes his way.
</P>
<P>
   But then, the 34-year-old Hasek has been known to wander. As
goaltenders go, he lives to travel the road not taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell him all the time, `Stay in the net, stay in the net,'
'' said Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff, the morning after his Sabres
pulled into a 2-2 tie in the Stanley Cup finals. ``Then I look up
and he's gone on another of his fishing trips. It's just his way of
staying in the game, and it's something you have to live with.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek was at his traveling and animated best in Game 4 of the
best-of-seven series Tuesday night, his 30 saves backing the Sabres
to an impressive 2-1 win over the Dallas Stars. When he wasn't
doing the basics, turning himself inside out in front of the cage,
he was straying far afield to handle the puck and sometimes angrily
charging out of his crease, looking like some undersized, outraged
Disney character standing up to whatever fire-breathing Dallas
dragon crossed his territory.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made and written of Hasek's playing style, his
technique, or lack of it. What was once thought to be
unconventional now has become increasingly the norm among NHL
netminders. Witness: with 4:25 to go in the second period Tuesday
night, Dallas netminder Eddie Belfour made a blind backward flip in
his cage and dropped his paddle across the goal line just in time
to prevent Miroslav Satan from popping what would have been the 3-1
lead into the net. Had he not had more pressing matters to attend
to, Hasek right there might have filed for copyright infringements.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek's moves in net keep the editors of Gray's Anatomy up at
night, doublechecking their drawings, making sure the leg bone is
connected to the hip bone. At his double-jointed best, the
170-pound Hasek looks like an escapee from a circus sideshow act.
</P>
<P>
   But his moves out of net are a valuable device, too. He is the
game's best at handling the puck, timing perfectly when to leave
the crease and join the play. Then there is the fiery Hasek, on
display intermittently in Game 4, especially when the likes of
Derian Hatcher and Joe Nieuwendyk got his dander up when they came
a little too close to his personal space.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek on Nieuwendyk: ``He twice slashed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek on Hatcher: ``He tripped me after the whistle _ that's
what got me very, very mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they were too close. Maybe they took their liberties. None
of the alleged contact was anything truly menacing. Hasek's
reactions at times looked theatrical, if not histrionic. From afar,
it looked like Hasek was using the scrapes or near scrapes as
catalysts to get his team going. The day before, in a rare dressing
room speech, he implored his teammates to force the puck up ice, be
aggressive with their play, not to worry about possible odd-man
rushes on his net. If the play turned against him, he told them
all, he'd handle it. And so he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made of rubber, everyone knows that,'' said Dixon Ward,
who cashed in the game-winner with 7:37 gone in the second period.
``You could twist him in knots, it doesn't matter. But he has to be
careful, because he wants to get involved in every area of the game
sometimes. And the physical stuff, a lot of great goalies do it _
it gets them involved in the game. Patrick Roy does it. Ron
Hextall, when he was one of the best in the '80s, he did it. Billy
Smith did it a lot, too, but he swung his stick to a greater extent
than anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every Hasek move is calculated, be it the way he stops
the puck or how he pumps up his surrounding defensemen, who needed
something major to get them going after the Sabres managed only 12
shots in Game 3. He constantly loses his stick, but that's a ploy,
too. Ruff explained earlier in the series that Hasek discards the
stick when he senses he can be quicker and better at cutting down
and pouncing on loose pucks without it. He discreetly discards the
stick along the goal line, always in the crease, and then pounces
on the puck the way a kitten would a ball of yarn.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo tough guy Rob Ray, a 10-year aficionado of the fight
game, doesn't worry about the Sabres' prized goalie when the going
gets a little rough out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy's bored when he's in the middle of that stuff,'' said
an amused Ray. ``He does it because he wants to get into the game.
Harry Neale and Bob Cole (Canadian television) broadcasters, were
saying on TV the other night that Bobby Orr redefined the game for
defensemen, and Dominik has redefined the way goaltenders play the
game. He heard that and said, `Yeah, if I had a player's skates, I
could get out of the net faster and move the puck up the wall.' And
if he gets in some rough stuff out there, so what, he's got so much
padding, it's not going to hurt him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek turned back 30 of 31 Dallas shots in Game 4. On one stop,
he turned away a Guy Carbonneau shovel that would have tied it at
2-2. In one rare flash when he wasn't in position, he watched
veteran Randy Cunneyworth scurry into the crease and turn back a
Craig Ludwig blast that would have tied it early in the third
period.
</P>
<P>
   When the puck is dropped in Dallas for Game 5 Thursday, Hasek
again will be in net for the Sabres. At least that's where he'll
start. He is two wins away from adding a Stanley Cup to a trophy
case that includes an Olympic gold medal, four Vezina Trophies as
the league's best netminder, and a pair of Hart Trophies as league
MVP.
</P>
<P>
   Barely more than five years ago, no one had ever seen anything
like him. Now he's the norm. OK, maybe ``norm'' is a stretch, but
what else would it be when you're talking about Hasek?

HASEK STRETCHES THE NORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Be it his blocker, his glove, his stick, his
Slinky for a spine, Dominik Hasek is expected to lead the Buffalo
Sabres. They count on their star Czech netminder to lead the
charge, as much as anyone can lead a charge when his first priority
is to stand in front of 24 square feet of open net and turn back
whatever comes his way.
</P>
<P>
   But then, the 34-year-old Hasek has been known to wander. As
goaltenders go, he lives to travel the road not taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell him all the time, `Stay in the net, stay in the net,'
'' said Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff, the morning after his Sabres
pulled into a 2-2 tie in the Stanley Cup finals. ``Then I look up
and he's gone on another of his fishing trips. It's just his way of
staying in the game, and it's something you have to live with.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek was at his traveling and animated best in Game 4 of the
best-of-seven series Tuesday night, his 30 saves backing the Sabres
to an impressive 2-1 win over the Dallas Stars. When he wasn't
doing the basics, turning himself inside out in front of the cage,
he was straying far afield to handle the puck and sometimes angrily
charging out of his crease, looking like some undersized, outraged
Disney character standing up to whatever fire-breathing Dallas
dragon crossed his territory.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made and written of Hasek's playing style, his
technique, or lack of it. What was once thought to be
unconventional now has become increasingly the norm among NHL
netminders. Witness: with 4:25 to go in the second period Tuesday
night, Dallas netminder Eddie Belfour made a blind backward flip in
his cage and dropped his paddle across the goal line just in time
to prevent Miroslav Satan from popping what would have been the 3-1
lead into the net. Had he not had more pressing matters to attend
to, Hasek right there might have filed for copyright infringements.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek's moves in net keep the editors of Gray's Anatomy up at
night, doublechecking their drawings, making sure the leg bone is
connected to the hip bone. At his double-jointed best, the
170-pound Hasek looks like an escapee from a circus sideshow act.
</P>
<P>
   But his moves out of net are a valuable device, too. He is the
game's best at handling the puck, timing perfectly when to leave
the crease and join the play. Then there is the fiery Hasek, on
display intermittently in Game 4, especially when the likes of
Derian Hatcher and Joe Nieuwendyk got his dander up when they came
a little too close to his personal space.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek on Nieuwendyk: ``He twice slashed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek on Hatcher: ``He tripped me after the whistle _ that's
what got me very, very mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they were too close. Maybe they took their liberties. None
of the alleged contact was anything truly menacing. Hasek's
reactions at times looked theatrical, if not histrionic. From afar,
it looked like Hasek was using the scrapes or near scrapes as
catalysts to get his team going. The day before, in a rare dressing

aggressive with their play, not to worry about possible odd-man

STEADY CONSUMER PRICE INDEX ALLAYS INFLATION FEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The government said Wednesday that consumer prices were
unchanged, putting an end to April's inflation scare and confirming
that the nation's remarkable era of low inflation and strong
economic growth is continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said the Federal Reserve Board is still likely to
increase interest rates when its members meet June 29-30. But
positive news about inflation means a rate hike would be limited to
one-quarter of a percentage point _ and no more _ as insurance
against igniting future inflation, economists said.
</P>
<P>
   Fed chairman Alan Greenspan's scheduled testimony Thursday in
Congress will be closely watched for clues about his and other Fed
members' thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monetary policy is a forward-looking venture,'' said Oscar
Gonzalez, an economist for John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co.,
and Fed chairman Greenspan is ``thinking of pre-emptive moves.''
</P>
<P>
   A separate economic report, released Wednesday by the Fed,
confirmed that ``prices remain generally subdued.'' But the report
showed prices are beginning to rise in some parts of the country
due to strong demand for home furnishings and autos.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department in its monthly report on prices said
Wednesday that there was no inflation in May due largely to a
decline in energy prices _ the biggest monthly drop in more than a
year. Energy prices fell by 1.3 percent in May, the biggest drop
since February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In April, an 0.7 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index
was fueled by soaring energy prices.
</P>
<P>
   On another positive note, the so-called ``core'' inflation rate
_ excluding volatile food and energy prices _ rose just 0.1 percent
last month, down from 0.4 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation remained in check despite other reports that the
economy is barreling along.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of new homes perked up in May after three months of
declines, according to the Commerce Department. Despite a rise in
interest rates for mortgages, which typically dampens demand, total
housing starts rose 6.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 1.68 million units. That reversed a steep decline in April,
at a revised rate of 9.7 percent, and a 0.3 percent fall in March.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial production continued its rebound from a slump last
year in export demand at home caused by economic troubles abroad.
Factory production increased 0.2 percent in May in the fourth
monthly rise, according to the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   Even though there is no evidence of inflation today, analysts
believe that Greenspan will stick to statements made last month
that the Fed would lean toward higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting relief that inflation remains in check, the Dow Jones
Industrial average surged 150 points in the first half hour of
trading and finished Wednesday at 10,784.95, up 189.96 points, or
1.79 percent. The technology-heavy Nasdaq index posted a 4.27
percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some conern the Fed might be tightening quite
agressively to slow the economy, especially if we got another bad
inflation report,'' said Robert Mellman, senior econoist for J.P.
Morgan in New York. ``The market's relieved that's not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a growing fear of a rate hike has been the primary force
that has knocked the stock market from its levels in April and May.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market also rose for a second day as the reports of low
inflation provided reason to believe that any rate hike in 1999
would not be dramatic. The value of the benchmark 30-year US
Treasury bond increased $5.31, per $1,000 bond, causing yields to
drop 5 basis points.
</P>
<P>
   Fed watchers said that members will keep a vigilant watch due to
that tight supply of workers, which could push up wages, and an
economic expansion in its eight year which could spark higher
prices at any turn.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to inflationary pressures, economies in Asia and Europe
are recovering or strengthening, economists said. Low import
prices, to date, have been a strong force keeping US inflation low;
if prices rise, US producers will have less competition and will be
less inclined to keep their prices low.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger is when you've got strong domestic demand and
strong foreign demand, and you let the conditions continue you may
get to a point of more inflation,'' said David Jones, a veteran Fed
watcher for Aubrey Lanston &AMP; Co., a New York securities firm. ``The
Fed will lose its credibility unless it follows up with a couple
quarter-point moves.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wayne Ayers, chief economist for BankBoston Corp., said that
though he believes the Fed is poised to raise rates, there is still
a slight chance they will not do so at the June meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were pushed to the wall, I'd say yes. They feel they have
to do it eventually, and it's going to get harder,'' Ayers said. By
acting soon, the Fed ``won't knock the (stock) market on its heels
because the market has already priced it in,'' Ayers said.

GORE OPENS CAMPAIGN WITH ATTACK ON BUSH, DISTANCE FROM CLINTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTHAGE, Tenn. _ Vice President Al Gore officially unveiled his
candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination Wednesday with
a speech giving him moral distance from President Clinton and
policy distance from the Republican front-runner, Texas Gov. George
W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, born 51 years ago in Washington, D.C., told a crowd of
supporters in his other hometown that he is running for president
``so that our children may make a clean start from the right place,
a higher place, in a fresh century.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore paid his customary salutes to the accomplishments of the
Clinton administration, saying that it rescued the country from
economic doldrums and brought the 20th century to a righteous close
by fighting ``medieval tyranny'' in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But in introducing himself to the political world as a contender
for his boss's job, Gore loaded his speech with the same preachy
references to morals and ethics that are used by critics of
Clinton's personal behavior with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our own lives we must master if we are to have the moral
authority to guide our children,'' Gore said, shouting and growling
with emotion through much of his address in contrast to his
notorious stiffness. He added that as the country looks beyond
economic prosperity, ``There is a hunger and thirst for goodness
among us.''
</P>
<P>
   To win the Democratic nomination next year, Gore must defeat
Bill Bradley, the former U.S. senator and basketball star from New
Jersey. Polls in key primary states give Gore a less-than-crushing
lead over Bradley, despite Gore's standing as the heir apparent for
the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   But in his speech, Gore was clearly looking beyond the primary
to a potential match-up with Bush, who for now at least does have
crushing poll leads over his primary opponents.
</P>
<P>
   In national surveys, voters say they would pick Bush over Gore
and that the vice president is handicapped by his association with
the negative side of Clinton's record as well as a plodding
personality.
</P>
<P>
   Stabbing at Bush's ``compassionate conservatism'' theme, Gore
said, ``I want to keep our prosperity going and I know how to do
it. I want to do it the right way _ not by letting people fend for
themselves or hoping for crumbs of compassion, but by giving people
the skills and knowledge to succeed in their own right.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also took direct aim at Bush's policy stands in Texas on
abortion, guns and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing his support for abortion rights, Gore said people
have to make decisions on the issue ``based on their own
consciences, not government interference.'' Bush recently signed
into law a requirement that girls cannot get abortions without
their parents being notified first.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he wants to ``get guns off the streets'' while others
``want to pass new protections for gun manufacturers to shield them
from lawsuits.'' Bush has pledged to sign a bill that virtually
bans cities and counties from suing gunmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has championed environmentalism, criticized efforts to
``let polluters off the hook.'' Bush is urging older industrial
plants in Texas to end their exemption from certain pollution
regulations on a voluntary basis.
</P>
<P>
   Making comparisons to Bush even more obvious, Gore delivered a
few sentences in practiced Spanish. Bush's easy use of the language
helped him capture about 40 percent of the Hispanic vote in his
re-election campaign last year, a record high for a GOP candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore never mentioned Bush by name, but campaign aides made it
clear to reporters that the vice president is gunning for only one
of the Republican contenders, even with eight months to go before
the first nominating votes are cast in Iowa and New Hampshire and
18 months to go before the general election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a long campaign if Al Gore is going to be
yelling at us,'' said Bush campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker. ``His
speech sounded like a long litany of carefully tested and
well-polled items in an effort to be all things to all people. It
sounded as if he was previewing, coming soon to a neighborhood near
you, Big Government by Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``I do think he offended a lot of good work and good
people of faith by calling them crumbs of compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also listed policy proposals that are, for the most part,
extensions of Clinton's legislative agenda. He pledged to seek new
international trade agreements, a strengthening of the Social
Security system, control of urban sprawl, pre-school programs for
every child, a ``patient's bill of rights'' and new ways for
parents ``to protect their children from the marketing of cruelty
and degradation.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore gave his speech to about 2,500 people on the town square,
where he launched his first campaign for office _ a U.S. House seat
_ in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's father, a former U.S. senator who died last year, and his
mother, who attended the campaign kick-off Wednesday, said in 1992
they had raised their son to occupy the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But any regal pretensions to the top job stood in contrast to
some down-home touches added to Gore's first official campaign
event. Gore took the stage to the peppy sounds of a recording by
country singer Shania Twain. Warm-up entertainment for the event in
front of the county courthouse was provided by another Nashville
country crooner, John Michael Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters urging assistance for AIDS victims in Africa briefly
interrupted Gore's speech.
</P>
<P>
   After the visit to the Tennessee town, where Gore and his mother
own adjacent farms, Gore flew to Iowa, site of the nation's first
nominating contest in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will bring my OWN values of faith and family to the
presidency,'' an animated Gore said to a gathering at the
University of Iowa in Iowa City.
</P>
<P>
   Then he and his wife, Tipper, who is taking an increasingly
public role in the campaign, phased into a forum on education. Gore
said it was wrong for politicians to blame teachers for problems
with public education or to rule out a federal government role in
making education better. He also promised stipends for teachers who
sign up for additional training.
</P>
<P>
   It was a theater-in-the-round format, with Gore once again
bucking his robotic image by ad-libbing responses to questions
about education from pre-selected audience members.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign was bound for New Hampshire Thursday,
following the traditional campaign path that Bush took just a few
days ago. In interviews before his Wednesday speech, Gore put new
distance between himself and Clinton _ and acknowledged he was
doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's sexual misconduct with Lewinsky ``especially as a
parent, was inexcusable,'' Gore said, and dealing with the
controversy for more than a year ``wasted time'' that could have
been devoted to issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people realize any two individuals are different and
certainly the president and I are,'' Gore told a group of Tennessee
reporters Tuesday, adding that he is now politically free to
disagree with Clinton on policy matters.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, Clinton watched Gore's announcement, telephoned him
and said the speech was ``terrific,'' according to spokesman Joe
Lockhart.

GORE, DISTANCING HIMSELF FROM CLINTON, DECLARES CANDIDACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTHAGE, Tenn. _ Cradled by his family and the rural town he
claims as home, Vice President Al Gore officially announced his
candidacy for president Wednesday in a speech that seemed to say
less about who he is than who he is not: Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Gore appears to have been straining to distance
himself from the president, and his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky.
Six months after calling Clinton ``one of our greatest presidents''
on the day of his impeachment, Gore said in an interview on ABC's
``20/20'' that Clinton's affair ``was inexcusable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Particularly as a father, I felt that it was terribly wrong,
obviously,'' Gore said in the taped show, which aired Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Aides insisted there was no coordinated strategy to dissociate
Gore from Clinton. And in fact, Clinton's name was invoked less
than three minutes into the announcement speech, as Gore praised
the administration for the nation's strong economy and high
employment rate. More than a few Democrats in the crowd Wednesday
said they hoped Gore's public criticism of Clinton was not part of
a larger campaign plan, saying it seemed transparently political
and in conflict with what the vice presdient had said before.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, given the wording of his candidacy announcement, as
well as the backdrop against it was set, it would have been hard to
deny Gore was trying to come into his own _ a critical effort now
that he is trailing Republican candidate George W. Bush in the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   In policy, Gore essentially remains a ``New Democrat,'' the
brand of centrist politician he and Clinton defined in 1992. The
vice president emphasized public school education, gun control,
health care, and Social Security. He spelled out his support for
abortion rights. He reiterated his call to control urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton once did, Gore made detailed promises, such as
implementing a free nationwide pre-school program, sustaining the
Earned Income Tax Credit for the working poor, and expanding the
Family and Medical Leave Act. Like Clinton, he spoke at length
about American citizens taking responsibility for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore added a new sensibility to the responsibility
checklist, with such words as ``values'' and ``goodness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask for your help to strengthen family life in America. And
I make you this pledge: if you entrust me with the presidency, I
will marshal its authority, its resources and its moral leadership
to fight for America's families,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With your help, I will take my own values of faith and family
to the presidency, to build an America that is not only better off,
but better.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to undercore the point, Gore was introduced not only by
his wife and high school sweetheart, Tipper, but by his oldest
daughter, Korenna Gore Schiff, who stepped in when her mother lost
her voice. Afterward, Schiff, 25, who is eight months pregnant,
lingered onstage with her husband and bantered with some in the
crowd who seemed more interested in her impending motherhood than
in the 51-year-old candidate shaking hands in the town square.
</P>
<P>
   During the speech, before he had even uttered the words ``I
announce,'' Gore was interrupted by eight AIDS protesters blowing
high-pitched whistles and carrying signs that read, ``Gore's greed
kills.'' They were silenced by Gore supporters and eventually taken
away by security. From then on, Gore was left with hearty applause
and cheers from the crowd, which was filled mostly with
firefighters' unions, telephone company workers, and public school
teachers from the region.
</P>
<P>
   A Gore spokesman said there were about 5,000 people crowded
along Main Street, beneath the giant Gore election banners and
old-fashioned store signs.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Carthage, there were no traces of the criticism Gore has
faced for his elite roots and longtime residence in Washington,
D.C., where he was raised during his father's time as a senator
from Tennessee _ and where Republican National Committee Chairman
Jim Nicholson Wednesday staged an event at a onetime Gore
residence, the former Ritz Carlton hotel, which Nicholson dubbed
the ``real Gore homestead.''
</P>
<P>
   After the speech, Gore flew to Iowa and then to New Hampshire as
the first stops on his official campaign tour. In the ``20/20''
interview. Mrs. Gore also talked about the Lewinsky matter,
describing her reaction at the time as ``very surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   A Gore aide Wednesday insisted the vice president was simply
answering reporters' questions about the affair, and said there was
``no affirmative effort'' to distance him from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Neal, Gore's criminal defense attorney, said the vice
president was simply repeating an opinion he made as soon as ``a
few days after'' the Lewinsky affair was revealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's anything but what he's been saying,'' said
Neal, who was in the crowd. ``He's said before the president's
behavior was indefensible. The president said it himself.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were some who disagreed with Gore's tactics, even
among his supporters. James Cook, 31, the manager of a McDonald's
in nearby Cookville, said it was ``not fair to backstab (Clinton)
now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he felt this way when this was going on, all along, why
didn't he say something?'' said Cook, who described himself as a
Democrat and longtime supporter of Gore. ``Now that he's running
for president, suddenly now he he disagrees with what Clinton has
done? I don't think that's right.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``There's going to have to be a lot of support to get
Gore elected anyway, what with Bush in there. This might not
help.''

NORTH KOREA SUSPENDS CONTACTS WITH SOUTH FOLLOWING SEA BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ North Korea said Wednesday that it was
suspending contacts with the South, a day after South Korean
vessels sank one of its warships in the Yellow Sea.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension appeared to be retaliation for the sinking of the
ship and the deaths of all 17 crew members. More than 20 North
Korean sailors may have died in a high-seas gun battle that lasted
less than 30 minutes early Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The North Korean suspension immediately endangered talks between
North and South Korea set for Monday in Beijing, although North
Korea did not specifically mention the meeting. It also deals a
blow to South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, who has singled out
closer ties with the North as a major pillar of his presidency. An
aide to Kim declined to comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the suspension appeared to be a careful calculation not to
destroy relations between the countries. In particular, North Korea
is receiving lucrative benefits from recent business deals that it
has struck with the South.
</P>
<P>
   So the North seems to be walking a delicate line, trying to
preserve the advantages of economic ties as it tries to retaliate
for military losses and negotiate for political advantage. That may
explain why it seems to be restricting visits to only Pyongyang,
the capital. It appears that other regions of North Korea are not
affected. But the declaration Wednesday was vague on that point.
</P>
<P>
   A statement carried by the official North Korean news agency
criticized the South for ``bringing the situation of the country to
the brink of war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We solemnly declare that we will restrict or suspend Pyongyang
visits of South Koreans and their contacts with us for the time
being in view of the serious situation created by the South Korean
authorities,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrol boats from the two sides circled Wednesday near the
disputed waters in the Yellow Sea. There was no exchange of fire.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean Chief of Staff Hwang Dong-kyu said the United
States and South Korea were cooperating closely on measures to
respond to North Korea and that the United States had agreed to the
``speedy deployment of U.S. defense resources.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Navy and Air Force planes joined South Korean aircraft
Wednesday in patrolling the Yellow Sea, according to The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation began June 7, when North Korean naval vessels
escorted fishing boats south of the ``northern limit line,'' the
customary demarcation line that separates the seas of the two
Koreas. The North does not recognize the line, but it had never
challenged it so openly.
</P>
<P>
   The North had periodically sent ships south of the line, but
they ordinarily retreated when ordered back by the South. This
time, however, the North Korean vessels refused to back off, and on
Friday, South Korean vessels began to ram the North Korean boats.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, tensions exploded in gunfire. South Korean patrol
boats sank a North Korean torpedo ship, killing all 17 aboard, and
damaged at least five other North Korean vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Two South Korean patrol boats were damaged, and seven South
Korean sailors were slightly injured. South Korea put its entire
armed forces on combat level of alert, which is a state of
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Although the U.S. Command in South Korea is closely watching the
developments, it has not put is 37,000 troops on alert.
</P>
<P>
   The disputed waters are rich in crabs. North Korea, suffering
widespread famine, particularly values crabs, because it can export
them for hard currency.
</P>
<P>
   The two Koreas are still technically at war _ the Korean War
ended in 1953 without a peace treaty _ and there are few visits
between the sides. Still, several thousand South Koreans are in
North Korea at any one time, many in various regions. One
increasingly popular site is Mount Kumgang, a scenic spot where
tours for South Koreans are run by Hyundai Corp., the largest
conglomerate in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The tourism deal that the North struck with Hyundai is extremely
attractive to North Korea, particularly because it has been
receiving millions of dollars each month.

COLONIAL CITY CLEANS UP FROM HUGE QUAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSANA HAYWARD  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PUEBLA, Mexico _ In this colonial city famous for colorful tiles
and Volkswagen Beetles, the sounds of shovels replaced church bells
as people went to work Wednesday to dig out from a strong
earthquake that damaged the heart of its historic center.
</P>
<P>
   The Tuesday afternoon quake that was felt across seven Mexican
states and rippled through downtown Mexico City killed 16 people _
12 in the state of Puebla, two in the Mexican capital, one in
Guerrero and one in Veracruz.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred others were hospitalized with broken bones or
rattled nerves.
</P>
<P>
   In the heart of Puebla, in the state of the same name, elaborate
church towers toppled, bell spires cracked and tiled colonial
buildings fractured. Modern offices, apartments and several tourist
hotels also were damaged.
</P>
<P>
   City archaeologist Eduardo Merlo said it would cost millions of
dollars to rebuild the 20 or so historic buildings pierced by the
quake, which measured 6.7 on the Richter scale and greatly damaged
this city of 1.2 million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians are passing out the hat to collect for their
campaigns,'' he said. ``Well now it is more important to pass the
hat to rebuild the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Yellow police tape cordoned off dozens of city blocks as
residents gawked at their familiar, but now-crumbled sites. Hardly
anyone went to work Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A daughter embraced her mother as they stared at the cracked and
lopsided Jesuit Church, built in 1578.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quake was so strong, everything fell down in the house. I
got under a door and started to pray,'' said Maria Teresa
Maldonado, walking arm-in-arm with daughter Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   Two blocks away in Puebla's main city square, Teodomiro Medel,
his hands grasping a trombone, sat on a park bench with friend
Trinidad Dominguez, who held a French horn.
</P>
<P>
   The two musicians are members of the city's band. But city hall,
part of it erected in 1714, may be closed for months or even longer
after ceilings toppled into heaps of rubble, temporarily burying
four people as well as centuries worth of records of births, deaths
and other official documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt the earthquake with such intensity. We thought we
would die,'' said Medel, a musician for the city for the past 16
years.
</P>
<P>
   As a soft breeze rustled the tall trees of the plaza, hundreds
of soldiers wearing blue dust masks over their faces awaited orders
to go inside the massive building, finished in 1906, to clean up
and remove archives.
</P>
<P>
   The quake spared the cathedral, built of marble and onyx, but
just the same it was closed Wednesday. So was the historic
Autonomous University of Puebla, which had more than 20 classrooms
and other buildings damaged by the quake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take millions of pesos to rebuild our university,''
said university rector Enrique Dojer Guerrero. ``I don't know where
our 45,000 students will go in the meantime.''
</P>
<P>
   The earthquake was centered in Huajuapan de Leon, 80 miles south
of here, but its strength was felt for hundreds of miles around.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico City, two people died from heart attacks after
buildings swayed like toothpicks for nearly a minute.
</P>
<P>
   An earthquake measuring 8.1 on the Richter scale killed
thousands in 1985 and memories from that devastating quake are
still fresh.
</P>
<P>
   But Puebla, the heart of Mexico's tile industry where beautiful
Talavera clay pots are exported around the world, doesn't recall
such a tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   The tremor also temporarily shut down the Volkswagen plant on
the city's outskirts, one of the last places in the world that
still roll out the old-model VW Bug.

CLINTON BACKS AGREEMENT TO CURB ABUSIVE CHILD LABOR PRACTICES  

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   GENEVA, Switzerland _ President Clinton said Wednesday he would
ask the U.S. Senate to ratify an international agreement aimed at
curbing abusive child labor practices that include forcing
youngsters into armed conflict, prostitution and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   The president condemned the exploitation of young workers in an
address before the International Labor Organization, an arm of the
United Nations that is expected to approve Thursday the pact
dealing with children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must wipe from the earth the most vicious forms of child
labor,'' Clinton told the ILO delegates meeting at the Palais des
Nations. ``These are not some archaic practices out of a Charles
Dickens novel. These are things that happen in too many places
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pledged to ask the Senate to approve the agreement as
soon as he returns from his European trip. His advisers said they
do not see major obstacles in getting lawmakers to endorse the
child labor ban, which represents a consensus among business, labor
and government officials from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement relies on voluntary compliance and does not
include penalties for countries or companies who choose to ignore
the prohibition on forced child employment. Rather, administration
officials said they hope that the monitoring and reporting
requirements in the pact will embarrass nations into compliance.
</P>
<P>
   The president's speech in this Swiss city was the first stop in
a weeklong European trip that will largely focus on Kosovo. After
Geneva, Clinton flew to Paris to meet with French leaders. First
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and daughter Chelsea are accompanying
the president on the trip. Both sat in the balcony as he delivered
his address at the labor conference.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the week Clinton will attend the economic summit of
industrialized nations in Cologne, where the heads of the NATO
nations will likely hash out with the Russians what their
peacekeeping role will be in Kosovo. Although not officially on his
schedule, officials say it is likely the president will end the
trip with a visit to Kosovar refugees in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   However, the conflict in Yugoslavia took a back seat briefly to
other issues as Clinton used the address to the ILO delegates to
press his case for increasing trade between industrialized and
developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``A failure to expand trade further could choke off innovation
and diminish the very possibilities of the information economy,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted the criticism of free trade pacts by labor groups
and others who often see such agreements as disproportionately
hurting workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In poor countries the gains seem too often to go to the
already wealthy and powerful with little or no rise in the general
standard of living,'' he said. ``So as we press for more open
trade, we must do more to ensure that all our people are lifted by
the global economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The message on trade appeared to be aimed partly at organized
labor in the United States, which has opposed Clinton's efforts to
convince Congress to give him broader authority to negotiate trade
agreements. Labor groups have argued that free trade pacts often
cost American jobs as corporations seek to take advantage of low
wages in developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who joined the president at the Geneva conference
was Jack Sweeney, the president of AFL-CIO, which has strenuously
lobbied against the free trade pacts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton clearly is hoping that leading the effort to eliminate
forced child labor will persuade Sweeney and other labor leaders to
soften their opposition to free trade pacts.
</P>
<P>
   The ILO agreement would apply to children under 18 and would bar
their forced employment in manufacturing and hazardous industries
or in the military. Furthermore, the agreement says these young
people could not be forced to get involved in illicit activities
such as prostitution and drug trafficking. The Clinton
administration has pledged $30 million to help poor countries steer
children into education.
</P>
<P>
   The president noted one success story in Pakistan where children
under 14 who had been forced to work for companies stitching soccer
balls full-time are now able to go to school because adult women
have taken their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said he had taken the lead on the issue by
directing federal agencies not to purchase goods made with forced
child labor.
</P>
<P>
   The ILO agreement would not affect U.S. laws, which, with the
exception of farm work, bars those under 16 from holding full-time
jobs.
</P>

   VLLASHNJE, Yugoslavia _ The dispossessed Albanians of Kosovo on
Wednesday began the the long-awaited return to their native land,
flowing back by the thousands to looted and burned villages despite
warnings from NATO and the United Nations that their homes could be
booby-trapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``My blood does not allow me to live as a refugee any longer,''
said 28-year-old Fadil Arifi, who returned to this farm village
three miles inside the Albanian border to find his electrical tools
stolen and his walls scrawled with extremist Serb slogans. The
Yugoslav troops who had occupied his house pulled out under the
NATO-imposed peacekeeping agreement on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Arifi's 50-year-old mother, Ferida, wept as she crossed the
theshhold she had not seen since she took refugee with a family in
neighboring Albania 2 1/2 months ago. ``I cannot take it all into
my mind,'' she said. ``We have come home, but my brother's son is
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Kosovar Albanians are flocking back home, tens
of thousands of Serbians are taking to the roads out of fear of
deadly reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday morning an estimated 33,000 Serbs had fled and many
more were on the way, despite efforts of Yugoslav authorities and
aid agencies to convince them to stay in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do anything to the Albanian people, but I am afraid
they will not choose who to kill,'' said Diana Grcic, who was
preparing to leave Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, NATO troops now are beginning to move into the
central and northern sectors of Kosovo, according to spokesman Col.
Robin Clifford, which are the next areas, respectively, that Serb
forces must leave.
</P>
<P>
   They still must be out by the June 20 deadline set in a military
technical agreement signed by NATO and Serb generals, although the
deadline for the first phase of withdrawal was extended for a day
to expire at midnight Wednesday. The Tuesday deadline was shelved
because roads were so clogged with outgoing traffic that the troops
simply could not get out, Clifford said.
</P>
<P>
   Since entering Kosovo on Saturday, NATO peacekeepers have come
upon or heard about 90 suspected mass grave sites, said Navy Capt.
Mike Doubleday.
</P>
<P>
   In Helsinki, Finland, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
reported that after eight house of talks with his Russian
counterpart that they made ``some agreements in some areas'' toward
resolving a Russian-NATO standoff over Moscow's role in keeping the
peace in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen refused to give details, but told reporters that he and
Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev would resume their
discussions Thursday. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will
join him in Helsinki Thursday to discuss the same matters with
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
   At the Albania-Kosovo border Wednesday, it was a helter-skelter
mass return to the war-ravaged Kosovo province as ethnic Albanians
were pouring across the border at the rate of 1,000 people an hour,
according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
   A simultaneous but slower flow of refugees came from neighboring
Macedonia, but at Albania's Morini Border Crossing, road traffic
into Kosovo backed up for seven miles.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was a reversal of the same jam-packed hilltop border
checkpoint this spring where glum refugees crossed after being
driven into exile during a Yugoslav campaign of ethnic cleansing.
That campaign ended a week ago, when Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic gave in to 78 days of NATO bombing, and these same
refugees have been waiting -- some patiently, other impatiently --
to return to what's left of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting atop suitcases and sacks of foodstuffs, refugees from
Kosovo's multitude of isolated villages were mostly riding home in
the same sturdy Yugoslav-built red tractors and farm wagons they
had ridden into their refugee camps. Town-dwellers were homebound
in old Mercedes-Benz sedans, brand new BMWs, taxis, buses and even
small vegetable wagons pulled by garden ploughs.
</P>
<P>
   Just before entering Kosovo, refugees were handed one more
leaflet from UNHCR officials warning that ``everywhere in region
there are mines and grenades all around you.''
</P>
<P>
   The one-page sheet, including a color photograph of one common
type of Serb anti-personnel grenade, which looks like a green can
of shaving soap attached to a white cloth handle. ``Don't touch it
or it can kill you,'' the leaflet warns.
</P>
<P>
   The number of those turning back from fear of mines were
negligible, however, NATO experts saying Wednesday that hundreds of
thousands of land mines have been laid throughout Kosovo, with the
heaviest concentration in the southern border areas.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Serb forces put down mines, but so did the Kosovo
Liberation Army. And unexploded NATO cluster bombs pose a similar
danger.
</P>
<P>
   So far four people have been killed by land mines, but others
have been seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   As they watched the refugees pour through the checkpoint, aid
agency officials expressed alarm at seeing the exiled Kosovars
begin rushing home before mines could be removed and necessary
convoys of medicine, ready-to-eat meals, water and mobile bakeries
could be sent in.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are only have skin-deep awareness of the dangers
they are facing,'' said UNHCR spokesman Rupert Colville. ``We
believe many of the villages may be mined and booby-trapped.''
</P>
<P>
   Also watching in amazement at the frontier was a detachment of
Italian NATO troops that have been training to escort organized
columns of refugees to carefully planned refugee centers at a dozen
sites in Kosovo. The Italians expected their first refugee to enter
Kosovo on July 11 -- nearly a month after this week's unplanned
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very moved about their safety,'' said Lt. Col. Franco
A. Pischedda of the Italian Caribinieri detachment. He said that
the refugees staying at the big Italian-run refugee camp in Kukes
have so far not begun moving home, ``but we don't know how long
they will stay.''
</P>
<P>
   A trickle of refugees, almost all men, began crossing into
Kosovo on Monday and Tuesday to reconnoiter their towns and
villages and then to return to Albania to inform their families.
</P>
<P>
   UNHCR officials noticed that whole families began crossing into
Kosovo late Tuesday, and spokesman Colville said ``this morning
(Wednesday) the floodgates opened.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with scores of returning Kosovars showed that most
were bound for towns and villages close to the Albanian border.
Whether the mass flow will continue in coming days to the more
heavily populated towns deeper inside Kosovo was unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those interviewed crossing from Albania said they had
lived with relatives or in rented apartments rather than refugee
camps. One notable exception were more than 1,000 refugees from the
United Arab Emirates' refugee camp in Kukes, who left the camp en
masse on Wednesday and flooded across the frontier waving flags of
the UAE.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs, meanwhile, were leaving Kosovo en masse. Men were loading
couches and washing machines and other possessions into a semi van
parked outside the residential hotel where the Krajina Serbs have
lived since they came here.
</P>
<P>
   They said they were determined to leave Kosovo by June 20, the
deadline for Yugoslav Serbian military and interior police forces
to withdraw from Kosovo. They fear the celebrations of ethnic
Albanians marking the end of Serb domination could turn from
exuberant to violent.
</P>
<P>
   None of those interviewed seemed to know exactly where the road
out of Kosovo would lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we consider ourselves like the wandering Jews, people who
have terrible experiences wherever they go,'' said Milos Mazibrada,
a third year medical student. ``My future is only one day at a
time.''
</P>
<P>
   At Pristina University, dormitory manager Very Denatovic(CQ
both) said she was expecting 4,000 Serbs from Prizren to come
sometime in the night. The school was thrown open to transiting
refugees several nights ago, and the International Committee of the
Red Cross is supplying food to help the moving families.
</P>
<P>
   ``If necessary we will open all the dorms because we want the
people to stay in Kosovo,'' she said. ``We'll tell them to stay
here for a while and if things get better in Prizren to go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Any hope of Serb fears being alleviated by the presence of
Russian troops was quickly dissipating.
</P>
<P>
   Between 200 and 300 Russian troops took up positions near the
Kosovo provincial capital of Pristina last Friday, hours before the
first NATO forces entered the province.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has pressed for its own sector inside Kosovo that would
be under Russian control, a position NATO has rejected. NATO's
position is that Russian troops are welcomed, but not to operate
their own sector.
</P>
<P>
   NATO fears that allowing Russia its own sector would risk
splitting Kosovo into Serb and non-Serb areas. Russia has long
historical and cultural ties to the Serbs, who dominate Yugoslavia
but make up only about 10 percent of the population in Kosovo, a
province that is part of Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia.

REFUGEES FLOOD BACK INTO KOSOVO, DESPITE HAZARDS

   DJAKOVICA, Yugoslavia _ The flow of refugees back to Kosovo from
the camps of Albania and Macedonia swelled from a trickle to a
flood Wednesday, despite pleas and warnings from international aid
agencies that it was not yet safe for them to return home.
</P>
<P>
   Columns 13 miles long formed on both sides of the principal
frontier crossing between Albania and Kosovo in a dramatic reversal
of the massive exodus in which 850,000 Kosovars fled the province
during a year of war of conflict with the Serbs and 11 weeks of
intense Serb harassment and NATO bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the thousands pouring across the borders Wednesday were
men who intended to check the condition of their homes, look for
relatives who stayed behind, then return to the camps to bring
their families home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone told me my sister and her four children had been
massacred in their home'' in Pec, said Mexhdet Morina, his face
showing the exhaustion of an arduous, 12-hour trip from central
Albania. ``I am going to look for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Morina and a half-dozen companions hired a wagon driver to take
them over the border to Djakovica, the first major city inside
Kosovo from northeast Albania. From here, they said they would walk
15 to 30 miles to see what, if anything, was left of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never felt so happy as I am now,'' said Sahit Brzhdara,
73. ``We know our homes are burned and destroyed, but we are
free.''
</P>
<P>
   Kosovars who stayed in the province despite the Serbs and the
danger of NATO bombs turned out to cheer incoming NATO soldiers and
offer hospitality to their returning countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   As Morina and Brzhdara's group rested by the Djakovica roadside,
they were approached by Xhavit Llolloni, 45, a local homeowner who
offered to feed and shelter them for the night so they could have a
fresh start in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``My food is your food,'' said Llolloni _ an especially generous
offer in an area where food has been scarce for months. But the men
decided to continue on, leaving Llolloni brushing away tears as he
waved goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovar Albanians who had been in hiding, some in cellars, some
in forests, crowded the streets and sat in their overgrown gardens,
celebrating their survival, cheering NATO troops and Kosovo
Liberation Army fighters.
</P>
<P>
   In other major developments Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   _ US Marines patrolling southern Kosovo disarmed about 200 KLA
fighters after a standoff with a guerrilla commander who refused to
surrender his men's weapons.
</P>
<P>
   _ NATO said deployment of its KFOR peacekeepers and the
withdrawal of Serb troops were on schedule. A spokesman in
Pristina, the Kosovo capital, said more than 26,000 Yugoslav troops
had pulled out, leaving some 14,000 still to go. In Belgrade, a
senior general said Yugoslav air force and anti-aircraft units had
completed their withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   _ US and Russian defense officials meeting in Helsinki said they
made progress during nearly eight hours of intense talks on the
issue of peacekeeping troops in Kosovo, and would meet again
Thursday. However, there was no resolution of the questions of
Russian participation in the peacekeeping force, or the Russian
occupation of the airport in Pristina, the capital of the province.
</P>
<P>
   _ More evidence of atrocities emerged as NATO troops spread
through central and north Kosovo, the last areas where Serbian
forces are present. French troops found human remains in the ruins
of a house in the southeastern Kosovo village of Vlastica and more
bodies were discovered in four wells in a village near Pristina
where villagers said up to 100 ethnic Albanians were slaughtered by
Serbs shortly before NATO peacekeepers entered Kosovo. A US Navy
officver said peacekeepers has seen or heard of 90 suspected sites
of mass graves since Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   _ The American contingent in Kosovo rose to more than 3,000
soldiers, along with 5,000 British and Canadian forces, 4,000
German and Dutch troops, 2,000 Italians and 1,500 French. About
50,000 allied troops, including 7,000 Americans, are expected to
keep the peace in five sectors of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Contacts between KLA guerrillas and NATO soldiers were sometimes
cordial, sometimes tense, as the KLA attempted to establish its
presence in a wide variety of locations and the Western troops
tried to keep control.
</P>
<P>
   KLA fighters walked through the devastated village of Zegra
escorted by US armored personnel carriers on condition they kept
ammunition magazines out of their guns.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers cheered and handed flowers to the guerrillas, who were
clad in black or camouflaged army fatigues and looked exhausted.
But witnesses said the guerrillas, who included some women, were
stopped and disarmed a few miles out of the village. Some of their
officers were handcuffed and arrested.
</P>
<P>
   A Marine officer confirmed that the US forces had to threaten to
call in Cobra attack helicopters before the KLA force submitted and
surrendered its arms.
</P>
<P>
   British government sources in London said NATO and the KLA had
agreed on the outlines of a plan for disarming KLA fighters. They
said the framework agreement was reached at talks between military
officials in Tirana, the Albanian capital, and forwarded to the
North Atlantic Council, NATO's ruling political body. But Russia's
ambassador to the United Nations said the 15-member Security
Council needed to deal with the refusal of the KLA to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   Serb refugees in cars or tractors crammed with their belongings
poured into towns elsewhere in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Some arrived in Belgrade, forcing many in the capital to wonder
whether Kosovo, which Serbs regard as their cultural heartland,
might soon be bereft of Serbs, who made up 10 percent of the
pre-crisis population of some two million.
</P>
<P>
   Marko Jaksic, head of the Kosovo branch of the Democratic Party
of Serbia, said 80,000 Serbs had been displaced since the Yugoslav
army pullout began.
</P>
<P>
   He said columns of refugees heading for Belgrade were several
miles long, and that there were virtually no Serbs left in the
southern part of Kosovo. Many were setting their homes on fire
before leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav and NATO officials alike appealed to the Serbs to stay.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's Kosovo Force commander, General Sir Michael Jackson, told
Serb villagers near Pristina: ``We believe the world has too many
refugees already. I beg you not to make the number any greater.
Stay at home and we will look after you.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Bishop Artemije of the Serbian Orthodox Church, who had
urged Serbs in Kosovo's second-largest city to remain, joined the
flight. Under armored escort by German peacekeepers, the bishop and
a number of Serb families left Prizren for Pristina, the German
command said.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of the city's last ethnic Serb residents followed
within hours, as refugees on their way back into Prizren jeered and
laughed at them.

   VERMITCA, Yugoslavia _ In the first big wave of a reverse exodus
of refugees who were driven from Kosovo in a Serbian campaign of
terror, more than 12,000 cheering, stunned Albanians began the
journey home Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Their exodus created the kind of chaos for refugee agencies that
aid workers had feared. By mid-afternoon, the line of honking,
over-loaded cars, trucks and tractors up the crumbling road out of
Albania toward this Kosovo border village was 5 miles long. The
trip by car from Kukes, the rutted Albanian town 15 miles down the
mountain where 120,000 refugees have made their temporary homes,
was at one point taking four and a half hours.
</P>
<P>
   Field workers from the office of the U.N. high commissioner for
refugees began registering the names of the returning Kosovar
Albanians at the border at 7 a.m., but gave up three hours later
when it became too cumbersome and slowed down the flow.
</P>
<P>
   The refugee agency in essence ceded the registration to the
Kosovo Liberation Army, the rebel guerrillas who fought Serb forces
in Kosovo. Since the Albania-Kosovo border opened Monday at 6 p.m.,
the rebels have quickly and methodically taken down in spiral
notebooks the names of heads of families, their ages and places of
residence in an awkward but effective partnership with German NATO
forces at the crossing.
</P>
<P>
   The slow trip up to the border seemed to have little effect on
the high spirits of the refugees, who waved the Kosovar
two-fingered victory sign and shouted ``NATO, NATO!'' in what
sometimes seemed like a moving party up the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We survived the worst aggressors in the world!'' shouted
Mehmet Laska, 49, a mechanic from the nearby Kosovar town of
Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   This was the place, just two and a half months ago, that the
same refugees had crossed in a driving rain from Kosovo into
Morini, Albania, weeping and shocked, with lips cracked and
bleeding from thirst on what was often a three-day walk to the
border.
</P>
<P>
   This time the mood was jubilant, even though many refugees were
going home to houses that had been destroyed. ``It's better in a
tent in my garden than here,'' said Qamil Berisha, 35, of the Suha
Reka district, who said his house had been burned to the ground by
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Although workers at the border for the U.N. refugee agency were
passing out leaflets in Albanian that warned about landmines, booby
traps, unexploded bombs and shortages of water, food and
electricity, they elicited mostly shrugs from refugees who for the
first time in months could see the rolling green hills of southern
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The leaflets asked the Albanians to ``please be patient'' while
waiting for aid agencies to accompany them home as soon it was
safe, and for the past week refugees in Kukes have been obediently
saying that they would do so. But in what seemed a massive 24-hour
psychological shift, from a state in which they did not dare to go
home to one in which it seemed impossible to stay away, refugees
listened to the news of NATO's advance on their radios, watched
what their neighbors were doing, then packed up and left.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:30 Wednesday morning at a Kukes refugee camp, Sahara Sopaj,
23, from the Rahovec district, said that she and her family would
not go home for three or four more days, and that they wanted to be
accompanied by aid workers when they did. But by 6:30 Wednesday
evening, after refugees had poured out of the camps all day, Ms.
Sopaj and her family turned up beaming in the back of their truck
at the border crossing, waving goodbye as they headed home.
</P>
<P>
   It was exactly the kind of mood change that aid workers have
been dreading, fearing that refugees will suffer because they
rushed back before aid workers could establish a system to help
them. Officials from the U.N. refugee agency worked feverishly on
both sides of the border, saying all was under control, although
one worker eyeing tractor after chugging tractor sighed wistfully
and said, ``I feel like I'd like to organize. But it's only a
wish.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis McNamara, the agency's special envoy to the Balkans,
turned up at noon for a hastily called news conference in the front
yard of an elementary school in Prizren and announced that the
sudden migration of the refugees was ``not a nightmare scenario,
it's just rather earlier than we would have wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter from NBC began insisting that someone needed to
control the Albanian border, McNamara responded by asking, ``How do
you control half a million people if they want to move?''
</P>
<P>
   About a million Albanians left Kosovo during the crisis, and
some 435,000 of them are in Albania. Aid workers said the main
problem, aside from the safety of the refugees, is that they are
just beginning to set up an operation to handle the estimated
500,000 ``displaced persons'' who stayed in Kosovo, many of whom
have no homes and have been scrounging for food.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the refugees will have the same needs as the Albanians
who stayed home. One of them is Ferit Saramati, a refugee from the
village of Dobrush, who approached an official of the U.N. refugee
agency, Jean-Marie Garreli, at the border Wednesday morning and
asked for a tent because he had gone back home to discover that the
Serbs had burned his house to the ground. Garreli said he would not
be able to help Saramati for a few more days. ``We are neither
encouraging nor endorsing the repatriation,'' Garreli said
afterward. ``We are insistent on the fact that it's not safe.''

</P>
<P>
   Despite the number of refugees, the procedure once they reached
the crossing point went swiftly. As a vehicle drove in the gate,
workers from the U.N. agency quickly counted the people inside _
there were sometimes 25 or more in the trucks _ then handed out a
plastic card with a number on it to each family head, an
abbreviated version of the more elaborate registration system they
abandoned around 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was that a refugee could use the card in the next
months to more formally, and voluntarily, register. But since the
refugee agency did not take down names to go with the numbers, the
usefulness of the system is unclear. The registration system is
important because most refugees were stripped of their identity
papers by Serbian forces. No one asked the refugees for any proof
of who they were.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the refugees were directed by German troops up to
members of the rebel group, who did take their names, and were
counting up their number, by hand, at the end of the day. The
process was excruciatingly slow until the rebels borrowed a
calculator from a reporter, which helped.
</P>
<P>
   By 7 p.m., the U.N. refugee agency announced that there had been
more than 12,000 Albanians crossing over in the previous 12 hours,
which appeared to be consistent with the number that the rebels
were working out.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of the rebels at the border created a delicate
situation for the Germans, who are here as part of a neutral
peacekeeping force that is to protect Serbs as well as Albanians.
But the rebels can take down the Albanian names far faster than the
Germans, and were made part of the border procedure in a meeting
Tuesday between German and rebel leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The German soldiers and rebels at the crossing worked closely
together to solve problems, like moving two stone barricades that
were slowing down traffic, and at one point a German soldier spoke
in German to two members of the rebel group and asked if there were
any girls in town. The rebels said no.

ALBANIAN LEADER IN KOSOVO IS ALIVE, BRITISH SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Veton Surroi, the ethnic Albanian leader
in Kosovo whose reported death was a blow to Western allies, is
alive and has met with senior British government officials, they
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   NATO said on March 29 that Surroi was murdered by Serb forces, a
claim repeated by the White House on April 6. His purported death
was widely reported as a blow to the efforts to stabilize Kosovo
and establish a democratic government.
</P>
<P>
   But according to a senior British government official who met
with Surroi last weekend, Surroi spent the 78-day war in a Pristina
cellar with his elderly mother.
</P>
<P>
   The British government's account is the first official
confirmation that Surroi, publisher of the ethnic Albanian
newspaper Koha Ditore, is alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's quite shaken, but he's alive and well,'' said a British
government official who met with Surroi over the weekend and who
spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Surroi's survival is crucial to the West's postwar strategy of
building a pro-western democracy in Kosovo. The son of a Yugoslav
diplomat, Surroi is seen by Western leaders as the most likely
president of an autonomous Kosovo. Before the war, he was quoted
widely in American newspapers and appeared reguarly on CNN. He
speaks fluent English and is a favorite of Western diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   As the conflict in Kosovo appeared inevitable, Surroi replaced
the ethnic Albanian academic Ibrahim Rugova as the Kosovar leader
the NATO countries preferred to deal with and see as the probable
president in an autonomous Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The peace plan accepted by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
calls for the return of the autonomy that Milosevic unilaterally
ended in 1989. Surroi's support in Washington and the capitals of
western Europe, meanwhile, makes it likely that he will emerge as
the most influential ethnic Albanian in Kosovo, once he emerges
from hiding.
</P>
<P>
   As one US diplomat put it before the war, ``Rugova doesn't have
the street cred (credibility) that Surroi has.''
</P>
<P>
   That credibility with the ethnic Albanians who before the war
made up 90 percent of Kosovo's population will only be increased by
Surroi's having ridden out the war in a damp, musty basement with
his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Surroi was a member of the ethnic Albanian delegation which
agreed to a Western plan to end the violence in Kosovo. In a series
of interviews, Western diplomats, including those from the United
States, described Surroi as the voice of reason in the Albanian
camp, bridging the gap between the moderate views of Rugova and the
extreme views of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA has stepped into the vacuum created by withdrawing Serb
forces, killing Serbs at a rate that has alarmed the NATO allies.
Surroi is seen as a moderating influence, but it remains unclear
when he will publicly surface, and whether he can rein in the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is waiting until the Serbs leave Pristina,'' a British
official said Wednesday.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When the tall man talks, people tend to listen.
They have to, because he speaks so softly. So the other day, in a
room overlooking San Francisco Bay, maybe three dozen
environmentalists listened closely as Bill Bradley led them through
a discussion that began with the wind in the sycamore trees in his
home town on the Mississippi River in Crystal City, Mo., then
threaded its way through the thickets of California's water wars
and finally, almost by chance, to the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, there's only one reason to run for president of the
United States,'' Bradley told a listener who asked him why he was
doing it. ``That's because you think your leadership could improve
the quality of life for millions of Americans. I look at my
situation and think ability matches the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   That understated answer distills the way Bradley has campaigned
up and down California this week: personally, peacefully, almost
obliquely. From a storefront black church in South Central Los
Angeles to a mentoring program for minority teen-agers and new
immigrants in Sacramento, from an earnest discussion with underpaid
home-care workers to a playful pass through the Farmer's Market in
Hollywood, where he made like Meadowlark Lemon with a couple of a
cantaloupes, his style has been the same: He talks quietly about
the issues that drive him, like race relations or the environment,
and lets everything else _ including his candidacy _ speak for
itself.
</P>
<P>
   On this road trip, there is no set stump speech, no repeated
slogan, few snappy sound-bites. There is just a tall man talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted in this trip, notwithstanding what the pundits have
said, to show that you can campaign in California person-to-person
and succeed,'' Bradley said of his nine-day swing through the
Golden State, a bit of creative counter-programming intended to
keep his underdog presence on the radar screen as Vice President Al
Gore, his rival for the Democratic nomination, officially kicked
off his candidacy in Tennessee on Wednesday. ``I want to show
respect for the voters of California, just like I show respect for
the voters of Iowa or New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost no one thinks that retail campaigning is the way to win
in California, where politics sometimes seems to exist only in paid
television advertising and the disembodied debates of direct mail.
But as he finally embraces the quest for the presidency that he
considered and rejected several times before, Bill Bradley is not _
ostentatiously not _ a candidate who buys what everyone else
thinks. And for better or worse, as he lopes along, trailing Gore
in California by worse than 2-1 in the latest Los Angeles Times
poll, Bradley, more than ever, seems to have a sense of where he
is.
</P>
<P>
   There is still the lanky 6-foot-5-inch grace that marked his
years as a basketball star for Princeton and the New York Knicks,
and the cool, cerebral blend of diffidence and directness that
suffused his 18 years in the Senate from New Jersey. But two and a
half years after Bradley left Washington for writing and teaching,
there is something else as well: a kind of Zenlike calm and
self-acceptance that makes him seem looser, easier, lighter than he
did in his days on Capitol Hill, when he tended to come forth
periodically with carefully wrought pronouncements on topics like
trade, taxes or race but otherwise often stayed above the fray.
</P>
<P>
   ``I developed a real peace of mind about what I'm doing now,''
Bradley said in an interview between campaign stops on Tuesday. ``I
have a clear sense of why I want to do it, what I want to do and
how I want to do it. I'm just being myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is not running the anarchic, outsider campaign of a
Jerry Brown or Ross Perot. There are plenty of traditional
campaign-style events, including a Beverly Hills fund-raiser to be
headed by entertainment mogul Barry Diller on Thursday, and
structured sessions of empathetic discussion with diverse
constituent groups that President Clinton has made de rigueur in
contemporary politics. Bradley acknowledges that television
advertising will be important and on Wednesday, he made a
traditional policy speech on child poverty at Para Los Ninos, a
respected child care center on Skid Row downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``After seven years of the first two-term Democratic
administration since Franklin Roosevelt, the percentage of American
children living in poverty has barely changed,'' Bradley said,
calling for greater parental involvement and improved day care
standards, but omitting mention of the most specific proposals in
the news release circulated by his staff: raising the minimum wage
and expanding the federal earned income tax credit for working
families.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, he is striving to do things differently. He has
yet to take a poll, for example, and is ``not trying to be some
kind of political mannequin,'' as he told a Los Angeles television
reporter. Or, as he told the environmentalists in San Francisco, he
hopes to construct, ``a narrative and some coherence to all these
things that are occurring in people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the way politics are done today, too often you try to
be somebody else,'' Bradley said in the interview. ``And I think
that quite frankly the press is bored with this as much as the
politician is bored with it. And I think the idea of my relating to
the press, meaning standing before some backdrop and saying three
or four poll-tested phrases in an attempt to manipulate you only
makes you angrier and therefore your job is to destroy, or as you
would say, unmask, the candidate, and basically on both sides of
the equation it's boring. So my view is my job is to make something
happen with people out there.''
</P>
<P>
   How well that approach will work, and how well Bradley can
execute it, remains to be seen. He says his top priorities will be
to ``be a good steward of a good economy,'' protect the
environment, assure that ``every child in America has a chance to
realize his or her potential,'' and to overhaul campaign finance
laws, but those are not vastly different from Gore's, and Bradley
defers almost all discussion of specifics until the fall.
</P>
<P>
   And although Bradley has criticized Gore for relying on
small-bore ideas, some of his own proposals are not exactly giant,
like the notion of creating ``15-month houses'' where unwed
teen-age mothers could live under supervision in the final months
of pregnancy and the first months of their child's life to learn
parenting skills.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With small groups, Bradley radiates an easy air, as if he were
telling a bedtime story or family yarn. At a round-table discussion
with officials of the local Planned Parenthood in San Francisco, he
studiously avoided taking a position on whether the French abortion
pill, RU-486, should be distributed here and at one point mistook
that drug for the ``morning after'' emergency contraception pill.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many of Bradley's listeners have been impressed with his
command of their issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not everybody who understands this,'' said Dana Simon, a
lead organizer and field representative for Local 250 of the
Service Employees International Union in Northern California who
listened to Bradley discuss the plight of home-care workers
struggling to win the right to collective bargaining in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, as he joked with political reporters in Sacramento
on Monday, Bradley took heart from the underdog performance of his
old team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' he said dryly, ``the Knicks are proving that speed
and quickness are more important than bulk.''

<P>
   KOBOJE, Yugoslavia When Zaim Rahmani and his eight family
members chugged up the hill on their red tractor to this hillside
village, they got some good news: nobody had stolen the cherries
from their one cherry tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot believe it _ it's like a dream,'' said his wife,
Sadet, who returned to find that her home was looted but not burned
to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Their two horses were gone, and so was their Goldstar color TV
set and the dress pants his son had worn for his wedding. So was a
$500 oriental carpet.
</P>
<P>
   Every room in their two-story farmhouse was in shambles from
looters who had ripped apart pillows and pulled off heating vents
looking for hidden money. Happily, they didn't leave behind any
money to steal.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the Kosovar families who flooded back into Kosovo,
the Rahmanis didn't totally ignore the United Nations' warnings
about the danger of mines and booby traps in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they sent Rahmani, 47, as a scout on Tuesday to pick
his way back into the village and determine whether the family
could safely return. He came back Tuesday evening saying there were
no mines in sight. And less than a day later, the family was packed
up and headed home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was impossible to stay there any more,'' said Rahmani. ``We
were 70 people jammed into one private house in Albania. I had to
pay 600 Deutchemarks (about $400) every month for rent there, plus
60 Deutchemarks (about $40) a month for a place to park my tractor.
Now I have no more money to stay there. So we have to come back
here.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the practical part of Rahmani's explanation for why his
family is choosing to risk hunger and hidden explosives to return
home weeks before the international refugee agencies intended.
</P>
<P>
   But there was also the emotional part, the part that touches on
his patriotism toward a spot on a map and a territory called Kosovo
that may never exist as an independent country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to return,'' he said. ``It is my house, it is my
country.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Sadet, said she spent all night Tuesday in the
Albanian border town of Kukes packing and preparing food for the
first 10 days back in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:30 a.m., she caught her first glimpse in two and a half
months of her 20-year-old son, Arben, who is a baker. For all that
time Arben has been a captive of Yugoslavian troops, who forced him
to bake bread for the soldiers at a camp near the border. Arben was
found by his father, Zaim, just in time to ride the family's red
model IMT-539 Yugoslav-made tractor from Kukes back to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Another son, 18-year-old Afrim, is a soldier for the Kosovo
Liberation Army. The family doesn't know where he is but has heard
that he is still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Rahmani said it's too late this year to plant crops, and he is
worried about how long his supplies will last.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have enough food for the summer,'' said Rahmani. ``We
brought along some canned fish and wheat from Albania, and I have
almost 10 kilograms of sugar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, we can eat the cherries from our tree for about a
week.''

REBELS PROVIDE OFFICIAL LEADERSHIP IN KOSOVO TOWN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   DJAKOVICA, Kosovo _ They've occupied the mayor's office, the
youth center and the post office. They're sending doctors,
medicines and food up to the refugees struggling down from the
mountains. The Kosovo Liberation Army is running this town, taking
charge of everything from civil defense to refugee assistance and
rebuilding of houses, demolished by the Serb military.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is welcome here, and we think they can help'', KLA vice
commander Mehmetali Perolli said from the rogue army's local
headquarters, situated in a local youth center. But the KLA is the
army of the people.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA is supposed to demilitarize, under the peace agreement,
although they are not required to surrender their small arms.
</P>
<P>
   NATO was negotiating with the KLA Wednesday over giving up their
guns to make the exodus of Serb forces from Kosovo less tense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to make sure that we defuse potentially explosive
situations, said Brig. Gen. Brantz Johnson Craddock. ``We don't
want KLA, armed KLA, in proximity of withdrawing Serbs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA forces are highly visible here, but while all are
uniformed, few Wednesday appeared to be carrying a weapon _ a
switch from the scene on Tuesday, when many of the guerrilla
soldiers had Kalashnikovs slung over their backs.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian Kosovo Force (KFOR) troops assigned to patrol
Djakovica appear to be in friendly cooperation _ though not
collaboration _ with the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are never seen exchanging conversation, but
neither has interfered with the other's movements.
</P>
<P>
   The power vacuum was enormous after the Serb forces pulled out,
and the KLA stepped in immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Taking over the mayor's office was no problem, since the former
mayor, a Montenegrin named Momcilo Stojanovic, headed out of town _
fearful, locals say, of retribution. Stojanovic's modest home in a
mainly Serb neighborhood is closed up and uninhabited.
</P>
<P>
   No aid organizations have arrived here yet to help hungry and
ill locals except for Medicins San Frontiers, a volunteer doctors'
group.
</P>
<P>
   KFOR tanks chug through the city, but residents say they need
their own army to feel safe. ``We're very happy about it. Someone
has to do these jobs,'' said Afrim Brovina, an architect.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian residents of Gjakovica _ a city which endured some of
the most horrifying and destructive attacks of the war _ are mainly
delighted with their new local administration.
</P>
<P>
   Children wear KLA gear, and locals happily helped KLA member
paste official-looking UCK-NATO-Kosova signs all over town
Wednesday. UCK is the Albanian acronym for the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   The handful of Serb civilians who are staying in Djakovica are
more nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not afraid of KFOR, but I am afraid of the KLA, said
67-year-old Milorad Jovanovic. ``I haven't done anything to
anybody, and I'm going to stay here. If they want to kill me, I'm
here''.
</P>
<P>
   The speedy and efficient take-over could position the KLA well
in later elections. Albanian politics are divided loosely into two
camps _ that of the KLA, and that of president-in-exile Ibrahim
Rugova, whose nonviolent approach to gaining independence for
Kosovo proved ineffectual and was one of the main reasons
frustrated Albanians founded the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   KLA leaders say they are focused on the immediate emergency _
not on politics. But they also made it clear that they will not
disband, even though the Serb military is leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, the war is not yet over'', said KLA advisor Arben
Hoxha. ``We don't think we have a free country yet.''

NOSTALGIC POPE RETURNS TO HIS BIRTHPLACE AND ITS MEMORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WADOWICE, Poland _ His fever subsided, Pope John Paul II sought
out the restorative powers of his birthplace, fighting age by
reminiscing about his youth in the small town of Wadowice.
</P>
<P>
   He read a speech, then launched into a long stream of memories,
rattling off the names of streets, shops, the local movie theater,
a few lines from a school production of Antigone, and in one
sobering note, the fate of his Jewish landlord during the
Holocaust. When young people in the crowd sang a Polish traditional
greeting, ``May You Live 100 years,'' the pope listened and replied
wryly, ``Its easy to sing, but its not easy to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The ailing 79-year-old pope had canceled all his public events
Tuesday after the Vatican said he was running a fever linked to a
viral infection. Until Wednesday morning, his aides could not say
whether he would be able to resume his schedule in Poland, but went
ahead and canceled a trip to Armenia on Friday and a Mass outside
Rome on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   When the pope arrived at Stary Sacz on Wednesday morning for a
canonization of the 13th-century Polish Queen Kinga, he looked
drawn and still weak. He allowed Cardinal Franciszek Macharski of
Cracow to read his homily, while he listened, eyes shut and his
head resting on his hand. The crowd of 700,000 people seemed to
help revive him. By the end, he joked and talked nostalgically
about hiking trails and boat trips in the surrounding countryside.
</P>
<P>
   In the main square of Wadowice, once named after the Soviet Red
Army and now named after him, the pope seemed suddenly refreshed.
``I have many memories,'' he said, ``at any rate, in this town,
everything started.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Life started, school started, my studies,'' he told thousands
of local residents, many of whom held a vigil for his health over
night, and even today, knelt on the sidewalk to pray hours before
he arrived. He paused, then continued, ``My priesthood started.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, the pope talked of his town, where he lived until
he moved to Cracow to enroll in the university, as a spiritual
source for him. In his spontaneous remarks, he was more prosaic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bookstore was over there,'' he said. ``Is it still here
now?'' He supplied his own answer, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And there was a pastry shop,'' he continued. ``After final
exams we used to go there for cream cakes.'' Covering his face
coyly with his text, he drew bursts of laughter by adding, ``We
survived those cakes.''
</P>
<P>
   He repeatedly tried to stop, saying, ``Enough reminiscing,
that's it.'' When the crowd chanted ``more, more, more,'' the pope
kept on, reciting at one point a few verses from Sophocles'
``Antigone,'' and mentioning the name of his childhood friend,
Halina Kwiatkowska, who starred in the local amateur production.
</P>
<P>
   A local priest interrupted at one point, and said, ``It's time
for the coronation,'' referring to the pope's plan to put gold
crowns on the painting of Our Lady of Perpetual Help, which hangs
in the town's basilica, where he was baptized, and to which he
prayed as a boy.
</P>
<P>
   The pope turned his head toward him, smiled ironically, raised
his hand and made a swatting gesture, as if suggesting the priest
was a spoilsport. He then proceeded with the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to Cracow, the pope, seemingly unspent, did not
go right to bed. Instead, he appeared at the window of the
archbishop's residence, a tradition on all his trips home to
Cracow. ``This pilgrimage,'' he began.
</P>
<P>
   When the crowd kept chanting, he said, ``Stop screaming,'' then
resumed when his audience had settled down. ``This pilgrimage is a
return to the beginning,'' he said. ``That's why I went to
Wadowice, where I was born.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, when the crowd shouted ``Long Live the pope!'' John
Paul II did not demure. With a smile, he said: ``You are right. You
are right. I am still alive.''

AS LIFE RETURNS TO KOSOVO CAPITAL, REMAINING SERBS DAMPEN MOOD
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The arrival of NATO-led peacekeeping
forces has brought Kosovo's Albanians to city streets and rural
lanes to celebrate, shouting ``NATO!'' and tossing flowers and
giving victory signs.
</P>
<P>
   But not in Pristina, the Kosovo capital. Here the mood is
tentative, wary and restrained.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO forces are patrolling the streets in jeeps and
armored personnel carriers and now, sometimes, on foot, some
Serbian police and military personnel remain in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of Serbs still in Pristina,'' said Gzim
Gercari, 33. ``And there are many armed and angry Serbs, who have
been drinking a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Gercari was one of many Albanians who remained in Pristina
throughout the war. But the last three days, he said, have been as
bad as anything he experienced.
</P>
<P>
   He lives near a headquarters for the Serbian militarized police.
As they have prepared to leave Pristina, under the terms of the
peace agreement signed by President Slobodan Milosevic, some of the
Serbs have been looting and smashing houses, and NATO has not
intervened.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ordered people out of houses and smashed windows and
demolished doors and stole what they wanted,'' he said. ``They
started to burn my apartment in Suncani Breg,'' a neighborhood of
Pristina, but a cousin put out the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, the police were finally gone, Gercari said.
But he worries still about anxious and armed Serbian civilians,
some of whom have been kidnapped by the rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, two Albanians were shot after getting into an
argument with some armed Serbian civilians. Early Wednesday
morning, at the downtown Brooklyn Bar, some very sentimental and
very drunk Serbian soldiers, in their fatigues, staggered into the
street firing their weapons into the air, as a goodbye to Kosovo.
As they swayed and dropped the barrels of their Kalashnikovs,
passers-by hit the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But after months of a heavy military presence and incessant NATO
bombing, when many Albanians were pushed out of Pristina or fled,
there is a new lightness nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   The streets are getting jammed again in Pristina, with the Corzo
cafe downtown now so crowded it is hard to find a seat, even though
there has been no water for the last two days. With espresso not an
option, people drink juice or mineral water or iced instant coffee
with some ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Albanians are returning home, from the camps in Macedonia and
Albania, but also from the mountains. In a poor Albanian section of
Pristina, near a new headquarters of the Kosovo Liberation Army and
an aid distribution center, Halil Dirbranaj, 41, pulled up
Wednesday in his tractor and a trailer stuffed with seven members
of his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yugoslav army threw me out of my house,'' he said, ``so we
went to the mountains.'' That was near a village called Kriljevo,
some 35 miles east of Pristina. They spent most of the time in the
open, ``with no protection from anyone,'' he said. ``We were just
hiding behind the rocks, open to the rain.''
</P>
<P>
   But even with his elderly mother lying pale in the trailer, as
one of his daughters held an umbrella to shield her from the sun,
Dirbranaj said he was afraid to go into his house, fearing Serbian
booby traps.
</P>
<P>
   Fatos, an Albanian of 24, arrived from Macedonia two days ago to
find the lock on his building had been changed, so he could not get
to his apartment. Hydajet came home to find his apartment looted
and burned. But others were luckier, finding everything as they had
left it, sometimes because of the intervention of Serbian
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   People are poor and hurting, but there are the beginnings of
what will be a hot economy designed to service the foreigners
pouring into Kosovo. ``It's going to be like Bosnia or Cambodia,''
an experienced U.N. official said, a little sadly. ``There will be
almost as many foreigners trying to help as those who need it. And
they will need restaurants and bars and brothels, and this place
will never be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   While there is no running water, making the atmosphere rather
ripe in the summer heat, there is electricity. And just a few days
ago, the main Yugoslav cell-phone company, Mobtel, turned its
transmitters on again in Pristina. There had been no telephone
service during the war. With travel restricted to Kosovo, the
province was almost entirely isolated.
</P>
<P>
   While most people assumed NATO had bombed the transmitters, it
is now understood that Belgrade did not want Kosovo reached by
telephone. It is also suggested by knowledgeable officials that
given the electricity problems, Mobtel also feared that it would be
unable to keep its computers going to charge customers for their
calls.
</P>
<P>
   At the misnamed Grand Hotel, stuffed now with journalists and
the first influx of aid workers, Albanians offer their services as
translators, drivers, money changers and landlords.
</P>
<P>
   There is a desperate need for restaurants for all these
foreigners and their money, but many of the restaurants that
existed before the war were owned by Albanians, and most have been
burned or looted. Many of their owners also remain abroad, as
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of the Corzo, Muslims from the Gora region between
Albania and Macedonia, are contemplating opening a new restaurant,
as are their waiters. But it is still too dangerous, they say,
wanting another week or so to see how the peacekeepers function and
how the Serbs react to the withdrawal of their military and police
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many Serbs are leaving Pristina, too, terrified that
the insurgents of the Kosovo Liberation Army will show up at their
houses to exact revenge. On many streets, one sees Serbs packing
their cars and trucks. Some say they are going for good; others say
they hope to be back. But their hope seems to lack conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors sweep Serbian families of atrocities against them, of
kidnappings and killings. Some of the rumors, unfortunately, turn
out to be true.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A missing poster has gone up for Ivan Celic, a 40-year-old
mechanical engineer, missing since June 14, believed kidnapped as
he was driving his Volkswagen Golf in the mostly Albanian area of
Suncani Breg. He has four children. ``Any information,'' the poster
says, referring to the peacekeeping mission, ``pass to the civilian
authorities and the KFOR mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday in Kosovo Polje, a British officer met several hundred
local Serbs to urge them to remain. ``If you are threatened, tell
us about it, and we will do our best to protect you,'' he said from
the steps of a Serbian Orthodox Church. ``You have to consider the
future of your country. If you want it to have a future, be
brave.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kosovo Polje is heavily Serbian, and many always intended to
stay. Dejan Jovanovic, 24, said many of the men would remain, ``but
the women and children will go,'' at least as a temporary
precaution.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, the Kosovo Liberation Army has proudly opened two
new offices. One is in a school, where young women in white
T-shirts and black overalls guard the gates.
</P>
<P>
   The other, the headquarters, was opened a few days ago in a
large house offered by an Albanian businessman. Uniformed, armed
soldiers stand guard and pose for photographs, while another
soldier mans a sniper position looking down the road.
</P>
<P>
   A British liaison officer from the Irish Guards entered to
discuss security, he said. ``It's really about getting them to
behave,'' he said crisply. Asked what it meant to ``demilitarize''
the Kosovo Liberation Army, as called for under the peace
agreement, he shrugged. ``Just now, it's important that they
behave,'' he said. ``They're a little confused, too, looking for
instructions. We'll get around to the rest in time.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Salih Mustafa, a 28-year-old history student who was the
commander of the guerrilla operations inside Pristina during the
war, talked coolly of having ``liquidated'' Serbian paramilitaries
and secret policemen and sabotaging buildings in what he called
Operation Hawk.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to say how many men were under his command, but he
had a presence that lent credence to his account, even if the
actions of his men hardly turned the tide of the war.
</P>
<P>
   But such operations were all he could do, given the shortage of
weapons, especially heavy weapons, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The army is grateful to NATO but remains entirely committed to
independence, Mustafa said. ``This war is a step forward, but we
still have work to do before independence. This NATO plan doesn't
solve the Albanian question, and it just restores the status quo in
this fake peace.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO and the West have different interests, he said, adding:
``That's why I call it a fake peace. Real peace will be when Kosovo
gets its independence.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's effort to demilitarize the insurgents is a form of insult
to the soldiers ``who fought to defend their homes, honor and
country, while the criminals of the paramilitary Serb forces burned
and looted houses, killed and raped, and they are put in an equal
position,'' he said. ``They can just take off their uniform and
weapon and go wherever they want in Pristina.''
</P>
<P>
   The NATO efforts will just be ``an interlude in the struggle,''
Mustafa said. ``Until we get the liberation of all Albanian lands,
there will be fighting in the Balkans.''

JOHN GRIFFIN, PILOT AND PIONEER IN AVIATION, FOUNDED SCHOOL; 92 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A memorial service will be held on Monday for John T. Griffin of
Osterville, Mass. and Jupiter, Fla., ``a true pioneer of civil
aviation in Massachusetts'' who blazed new commercial airline
routes across the North Atlantic and founded the East Coast Aero
Technical School.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Griffin died April 10 in Jupiter Medical Center in Jupiter,
Fla. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Quincy, Mass., his interest in aviation was sparked
when he was 5 and his father took him to an air show in the city's
Squantum section. ``We went on the electric trolley,'' he said in a
story published in the Globe on July 20, 1997, ``and I saw them
flying like a bird. I never got over it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1929, two years after Charles Lindbergh made the first solo
flight across the Atlantic, Mr. Griffin took his first flying
lesson on an East Boston cinder patch that would eventually become
Logan Airport.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Northeastern University, he got his pilot's wings
in 1930 and bought his first plane, a used DeHavilland Gypsy Moth,
for $1,000 in 1931. The following year he founded East Coast
Airways at Dennison Field in Quincy, where he offered flight
training and an apprenticeship program for aircraft mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   When the Boston &AMP; Maine Railroad was awarded a contract to
provide air-mail service to northern New England and sections of
Canada, Mr. Griffin became its chief pilot. When the federal
government forced the railroad to divest itself of the air-mail
operation, it was sold off and became Northeast Airlines. Mr.
Griffin became Northeast's chief pilot.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1940s, he met and married the former Mary Ormsby,
one of the first stewardesses at Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Griffin was also a pilot of the Massachusetts National
Guard. During World War II, in addition to training pilots and
mechanics for the Army at East Coast Airways, Mr. Griffin became a
pilot for the Army Air Transport Command. As the Army attempted to
establish reliable year-round airplane service across the North
Atlantic, Mr. Griffin pioneered several transoceanic routes still
used today. He landed the first Army plane on Baffin Island and
made several experimental landings on Arctic ice floes.
</P>
<P>
   Following the war, he relocated East Coast Aviation to Hanscom
Field in Bedford, Mass. and renamed it East Coast Aero Technical
School. The school has trained about 15,000 airplane technicians.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, when the Aero Club of New England honored Mr. Griffin
with its Godfey L. Cabot Award, Charles Collins, president of the
group, hailed him as ``a true pioneer of civil aviation in
Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, he leaves two sons, John T. Jr. of Centerville
and W. Nicholas of Framingham, Mass.; five daughters, Mary Blair
Byrd of Roanoke, Va., Anne Herrick and Lisa Hagerty, both of
Osterville, Marcia Russell of Columbia, Md., and Deborah Cuccia of
Milton, Mass.; two brothers, Gerald W. of San Francisco, and
Charles T. of Sandwich, Mass.; 12 grandchildren; and six
great-grandchildren.

NEW PROCEDURE HELPS REGROW HEART VESSELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Sam Hart, 81, of Rome, N.Y. couldn't even make it to
the mailbox without having an angina attack.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he had one almost every hour one night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost thought I wasn't going to make it to the operation,''
Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, he had bypass surgery. Last year, cardiologists tried
to do an artery-clearing angioplasty operation, but failed. Other
cardiologists told Hart, whose heart had trouble pumping, that
there was nothing they could do.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, Hart, a retired electrical engineer, became the
first person to receive genetically-engineered DNA into his
oxygen-starved heart muscle via a catheter to encourage growth of
new coronary blood vessels. These help to restore blood flow to
hearts with clogged arteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like someone who was waiting for the electric chair and
just found out I was going to be free,'' Hart said. He said now he
feels fine and pain has not been a problem since the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey Isner, chief of cardiovascular research at St.
Elizabeth's Medical Center, performed the procedure, which took 30
minutes and required no surgery and no anesthetics.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, injecting the gene into the heart has required
general anesthesia, a two-hour surgery and several days of recovery
time. Despite those drawbacks, more than 100 patients have
withstood the treatment by Isner since February of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Once this new, minimally invasive technique is perfected,
patients could go home one hour after it is completed, making it an
outpatient procedure, Isner said.
</P>
<P>
   In the new method, a catheter is inserted through a small
puncture in the patient's groin and directed to the heart using
x-ray imaging. A needle is then advanced out of the catheter and
used to inject DNA into the inner wall of the heart. This leads to
production of a protein known as vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF-2), which stimulates the growth of new blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprise was that there were no technical
complications Tuesday. ``No matter how many times you do this on an
animal, you are never sure how it will work out on a patient,''
Isner said. The procedure has been studied on pigs.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, many specialists nationwide have
experimented with this type of gene therapy for heart patients
whose only hope besides taking pills may be a heart transplant.
Some trials have involved injecting the genes into the heart muscle
or injecting the protein growth factors themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In the more than 100 patients of Isner's who have gotten the
gene therapy for angiogenesis, the term used for new blood vessel
growth, Isner said the response has been ``outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   But the promise for the approach with a catheter is that the
method could potentially be a safer alternative to bypass surgery
or angioplasty for high-risk patients. Also, if the treatment needs
to be repeated, it would be relatively simple, Isner said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nicholas Kipshidze, an assistant professor at the Medical
College of Wisconsin who has performed therapeutic angiogenesis in
patients with painfully clogged leg arteries, said that it is too
early to predict the wide use of the catheter method.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Isner is one of the pioneers of the methods, but we still
don't know the overall success of this procedure. It is still very
experimental, but it looks very promising,'' said Kipshidze.
</P>
<P>
   Because Hart had severe pumping function problems, he probably
would not have qualified for more traditional surgery, Isner said.
</P>
<P>
   Two concerns researchers have had about the gene therapy
experiments are that the blood vessel growth factors could nourish
the blood supply of undetected cancers and/or cause damaging
overgrowth of vessels in tissues such as the retina of the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Isner said about 60 diabetic patients who have gone through the
surgical procedure were examined by retinal specialists, who found
no changes in their eyes after the operation. ``I think that it is
becoming increasingly less of a worry,'' Isner said.
</P>
<P>
   As for induced angiogenesis causing tumor growth, Isner said
there has not been long enough follow-up yet to determine the
extent of the risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we haven't seen any new tumors in our patients, and
animal data suggest that the therapy is not likely to develop new
tumors, we nevertheless have to be very vigilant about it,'' Isner
said.

CELLUCCI SEES BRINKMANSHIP IN BUDGET POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Governor Paul Cellucci Wednesday accused the state
House and Senate of ``irresponsible'' brinkmanship in their
impending failure to produce a budget before the new fiscal year
begins July 1.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Globe, Cellucci said the delay is
reminiscent of state government during the financial crisis of the
late 1980s and creates ominous uncertainties for residents,
businesses, and Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most legislatures in the country have ended their session, and
these people can't get a budget to my desk by July 1,'' he said.
``I thought we had moved away from the years of brinkmanship
between the House and the Senate, but it sounds like they're right
back to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so much interested in who gets the credit. I'm
interested in who gets the results,'' he added. ``I want to keep
Massachusetts on course. I don't think this brinkmanship helps. I
think it's irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate and House budget leaders reacted scornfully to the
criticism. Senator Mark C. Montigny of New Bedford, chairman of the
Ways and Means Committee, called Cellucci's spending plan
``probably worth more as recyclable paper than as a budget
document.'' And Representative Paul R. Haley of Weymouth,
Montigny's counterpart in the House, said the governor was being
``disingenuous.''
</P>
<P>
   The possible gubernatorial aspirations of the leaders of both
bodies, House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran and Senate President
Thomas F. Birmingham, have fueled speculation that each man will
want the final budget to bear his imprint. The House plan focuses
on nuts and bolts priorities, plus a modest income-tax cut to 5.75
percent from 5.95 percent; the Senate pays much more attention to
social needs and does not cut the tax rate.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate have yet to meet in conference committee to
hammer out the differences between their fiscal 2000 spending
plans. Montigny and Haley held their first informal session
Wednesday, but the full conference committee is not expected to
begin meeting for three to four days.
</P>
<P>
   Those talks could last for two or three weeks, followed by a
10-day period in which the governor will review the proposal. If
Cellucci vetoes part of the budget, which he has pledged to do,
final approval might not occur until late July.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's budget executives say that such a delay would have a
broad, negative impact. Affected, the aides say, will be cities and
towns that will not know the size of local aid until weeks into the
new fiscal year and human service agencies that cannot expand
programs such as day care until appropriations are approved.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1979, the budget has been signed before July 1 only four
times _ in 1996, 1995, 1982, and 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Both Haley and Montigny said taxpayers will not be affected if
the Legislature is forced to pass an interim budget until the final
package is adopted. And taking care of the taxpayers' interests,
Montigny said, takes precedence over speed.
</P>
<P>
   Montigny, a Democrat who is shepherding his first budget,
likened Cellucci's criticism to those of fellow Republican Newt
Gingrich when he was minority leader in the US house, before
becoming speaker. ``You don't have to govern,'' Montigny said.
``You can sit there and throw things.''
</P>
<P>
   If the fiscal 2000 budget is delayed a few weeks, Montigny said,
``all that means is that some of his folks will have to work after
4 p.m.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the governor truly believes he has a quarrel over the
budget timetable, Montigny said, he should take it up with the
House. The Senate, whose Ways and Means Committee received the
House budget May 17, approved a $20.8 billion spending plan last
Thursday _ or only 3 1/2 weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the House passed its $20.77 billion budget May 12,
nearly four months after Cellucci unveiled his $20.4 billion
proposal. Haley said the governor's document ``was of no help in
moving this process along.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It suggests that we can expand spending, dramatically cut
taxes, and be all things to all people,'' Haley said. ``It
certainly is not a fiscal blueprint for the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the problems the House had to overcome in Cellucci's
budget, Haley said, was the governor's reliance on $130 million in
tobacco-settlement funds that might not be available until next
summer, a proposed reduction in the income-tax rate that would cost
the state $230 million next year, and the lack of a dedicated
revenue stream to replace dramatic cuts in federal highway funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a number of deliberations that had to take place''
during the House budget process, Haley said. ``We had to ask the
administration to supplement their budget recommendations with
backup to demonstrate how we could afford what they were
proposing.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's fiscal aides are unimpressed with those explanations.
``It's reasonable to think that the state can have its budget in on
time,'' said Thomas Graf, the state budget director. Failing to
meet that deadline, he said, will have a ``crumbling'' effect on
the state's image for Wall Street bond agencies.
</P>
<P>
   And unresolved issues such as a freeze on the capital-gains tax,
approved by the House and Senate but opposed by Cellucci, will
discourage new business here, said Kristen Keel, undersecretary for
administration and finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``No business will decide to come here until this issue is
resolved,'' Keel argued. She also said schools will have a
difficult time budgeting for the new academic year until the
education-aid package, which differs by $140 million between the
Senate and the House, is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't effectively plan at all until we get this budget
done,'' Keel said.

 &HT;    John Marshall Law School will fight for reprieve of death
sentence
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The verdict is in and John Marshall Law School is
headed to death row, unless it wins on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The school, one of two in the state with part-time evening
programs, was notified Wednesday that the American Bar Association
had voted not to grant the school provisional accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   With the decision, John Marshall students won't be able to take
the Georgia Bar exam after Aug. 31, 2001, and the 66-year-old
Atlanta law school will be forced to close because it cannot admit
any new students.
</P>
<P>
   The Student Bar Association plans to petition the Georgia
Supreme Court for extension of the August 2001 deadline, and law
school dean Robert D'Agostino, who filed a complaint with the U.S.
Department of Education, said he plans to ask the ABA's accrediting
committee to reconsider the decision at its Aug. 4 meeting in
Atlanta. If it doesn't, he will appeal to the ABA's House of
Delegates on Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   D'Agostino said the ABA admitted the on-site committee made
several errors in its report on the 250-student school. But it also
noted that the faculty workloads are too high, making it difficult
for professors to do research and perform service, and that the
library collection is too small.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to buy a whole bunch of library books that no
one needs and wants,'' said D'Agostino. ``Our mission is to serve
the educational needs of nontraditional students, not as the ABA
would like us to do, serve the research and leisure time interest
of the faculty.''
</P>
<P>
   The ABA said the school may submit another accreditation
application without waiting the customary 10 months or paying the
$25,000 fee.
</P>
<P>
   D'Agostino said he will explore how the school could survive
financially if it can't admit new students.

 &HT;    Tug-of-war between health and taste for Father's Day
 &HT;    By Dale Rice
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It's the classic dad dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   Father's Day is less than 96 hours away, and millions of
offspring are facing the big dinner question: Do you give Dad
something he thinks tastes good (like a juicy ol' rib dripping in
barbecue sauce and fat) or something you think is good for him
(perhaps a small salad, with grilled fruits and vegetables)?
</P>
<P>
   It's a tug-of-war between taste and health that extends far
beyond this weekend when children want to pamper Dad. This is a
three-meals-a-day, every-day-of-the-year issue: achieving a balance
among food choices that run the gamut on the scale of healthy
eating.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a foodie to do?
</P>
<P>
   One option is to follow the path of Steven Raichlen, the author
of ``The Barbecue! Bible'' and ``Healthy Latin Cooking,'' which
both won prestigious national cookbook awards this year.
</P>
<P>
   Raichlen will dive into a heavy plate of sausage, ribs, pork and
brisket with the best of them, as he did one recent noon hour at
the Iron Works Barbecue in downtown Austin. Then he'll turn around
and prepare a light grilled shrimp for dinner, as he did that night
at Central Market Cooking School.
</P>
<P>
   The key for Raichlen is moderation (he didn't eat every ounce of
that heaping plate) and intense flavors (whether it's barbecue or
low-fat cooking).
</P>
<P>
   And turning on the grill.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, grilling is a healthy cooking method,'' says
Raichlen, his head tilted, mouth poised above a beef rib that spans
his face ear to ear. Grilling is a healthy cooking technique, he
says, because ``there is little added fat.''
</P>
<P>
   Grilling also is something Texans endorse enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas,'' Raichlen says, ``is a major epicenter of the two
biggest food trends happening in North America right now _ the
Latinization of the American diet and America going up in flames
with barbecue and grilling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Grilling is wonderful,'' says Alexa Sparkman, a registered
dietitian in private practice in Austin. She contends that the
right grilled fish _ such as swordfish or shark _ can taste like a
beef steak if prepared well.
</P>
<P>
   If Dad still is determined to dine on beef, Sparkman suggests a
small tenderloin steak in the 4-ounce range. But first, she says,
trim all the visible fat and discard the bacon that wraps many of
them before tossing it on the grill. If the steak pushes 6 ounces,
which Sparkman says is a whole day's worth of protein, then Dad
should balance it with smaller, lighter meals the rest of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The point, she says, is moderation. In her practice, she tries
to help people find a middle-of-the-road place to begin a healthier
lifestyle. ``Extremes seldom work more than a few weeks,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   She also emphasizes portion control and flavorful ingredients,
such as salsas and pepper sauces, to give spark to meat and
vegetables. With balance and moderation, she says, people don't
have to give up their favorite foods in order to eat healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure life would be worth living without barbecue or
chocolate,'' Sparkman says. ``It's portion control, portion
control, portion control.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a mantra echoed by Raichlen.
</P>
<P>
   He says the traditional Argentinian grill plate, which is 95
percent meat, is enough to give the typical North American
cardiologist a heart attack. Instead of replicating that, he
suggests using a small amount of meat on the plate and filling up
the rest with vegetables and other low-fat items.
</P>
<P>
   ``Use meat as the accent flavor, rather than the focus of the
plate,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   That technique, says Dr. Jim Goolsby, a cardiologist with Austin
Heart, would help solve one of the major dietary problems in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   People eat too much fat, Goolsby says. He recommends a diet
concentrating on fish, poultry, fruit and vegetables, while
minimizing red meat and desserts. Still, that doesn't mean Dad has
to abandon steak altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is having steak on Father's Day criminal? No. But we hope to
achieve a life of balance and moderation,'' says Goolsby, a bird
hunter whose ideal meal includes smoked quail, pheasant or turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The important point for Dad to remember on his special day,
Goolsby says, is that parents need to set examples for healthy
eating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fathers need to provide guidance to their offspring, and
that's best done by example,'' he says. ``If a father doesn't eat
right, and hasn't his whole life, then how could he expect his kids
to do any differently.''
</P>
<P>
   To get dads _ and everyone else _ to follow a more healthy
pattern of eating, Raichlen says cooks need to emphasize flavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If healthy food doesn't taste well, we've lost the battle,''
he says. ``The central tenet of low-fat cooking is the use of
intense flavorings, rather than fat, to make food taste delicious.
If we could get people thinking about flavors, we would solve a lot
of nutritional problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Tips for healthy cooking
</P>
<P>
   Use chicken or vegetable stock in place of fat in recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Use intense flavors, not fat, to make food taste distinctive.
</P>
<P>
   Reduce the meat, increase the vegetables on the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Commandments for the grill
</P>
<P>
   Be organized _ have everything grillside before you start.
</P>
<P>
   Gauge your fuel _ you need enough to cover the time and area of
the food.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat grill to the right temperature _ 500 degrees for direct
grilling to achieve the best seared crust and charcoal flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Keep the grill clean _ clean it twice, before and after cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Keep it lubricated _ oil the grate to prevent foods from
sticking.
</P>
<P>
   Turn, don't stab _ use tongs, not a carving fork, to turn meat.
</P>
<P>
   Know when to baste _ sugar-based sauces should be added near the
end of cooking. Keep it covered _ each time your raise the lid you
add 5 to 10 minutes to the cooking time.
</P>
<P>
   Give it a rest _ let the meat stand for a few minutes before
serving to allow the juices to return to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Never desert your post _ grilling demands constant attention.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an unusual veggie for the grill. Impale okra on a skewer.
Brush with roasted sesame oil. Sprinkle with coarse salt and
pepper. Grill. ``The results are breathtaking,'' says Steven
Raichlen, author of ``The Barbecue! Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   Grilled Ripe Plantains
</P>
<P>
   4 very ripe plantains
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the grill to high. Cut the ends off the plantains and
cut each crosswise into 2-inch pieces. Coat the cut sides with
nonstick spray. Grill the plantains, turning occasionally, for 10
minutes, or until the skins are charred and the cut ends are brown
and caramelized. The plantains should be very soft in the center.
Trim off the skins (or let your guests do it) and serve at once.

<P>
   Texas-style Barbecued Brisket
</P>
<P>
   1 beef brisket (5 to 6 pounds), with 1/4 inch thick layer of
fat, preferably 1/2 inch thick
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon coarse (kosher or sea) salt
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chile powder
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   Rinse the brisket under cold running water and blot dry with
paper towels. Combine the remaining ingredients in a bowl and toss
with your fingers to mix. Rub this mixture into the brisket on all
sides. If you have time, wrap the brisket in plastic and let
marinate, in the refrigerator, for 4 to 8 hours (or even
overnight), but don't worry if you don't have time for this. It
will be plenty flavorful, even if you cook it right away.
</P>
<P>
   Set the grill up for indirect cooking. No drip pan is necessary
for this recipe. If using a charcoal grill, preheat to low. If
using a gas grill, place as many wood chips as you can in the
smoker box and preheat the grill to high. When smoke appears, lower
the heat to medium-low.
</P>
<P>
   When ready to cook, if using a charcoal grill, toss one-quarter
of the wood chips on the coals. Place the brisket, fat side up, in
an aluminum foil pan (or make a pan with a double sheet of heavy
duty aluminum foil). Place the pan in the center of the hot grate,
away from the heat. Cover the grill.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke-cook the brisket, using the indirect method, until tender
enough to shred with your fingers, 5 to 8 hours. (The cooking time
will depend on the size of the brisket and heat of the grill.)
Baste the brisket from time to time with the fat and juices that
accumulate in the pan. If using charcoal, add 10 to 12 fresh coals
per side every hour and toss more wood chips on the fresh coals.
(Add about 1/2 cup chips per side every time you replenish the
coals.) With gas, all you need to do is be sure that you start with
a full tank of gas.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the brisket pan from the grill and let cool for 15
minutes. Transfer the brisket to a cutting board and thinly slice
across the grain, using a sharp knife, electric knife or cleaver.
Transfer the sliced meat to a platter, pour the pan juices on top,
and serve immediately. Serves 10 to 12. _ ``The Barbecue! Bible''

<TEXT>
<P>
   After haunting investors for weeks, the specter of inflation
suddenly retreated _ at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer price index, which jumped a scary 0.7 percent in
April, did not rise at all in May, the Labor Department reported
Wednesday. And the closely watched ``core'' inflation rate _ which
excludes volatile food and energy prices _ edged up a mere 0.1
percent versus a 0.4 percent increase in April.
</P>
<P>
   While the Federal Reserve is still expected to raise short-term
interest rates at its meeting later this month, the absence of any
signs of inflation last month eased worries that the Fed was about
to embark on a sustained series of rate hikes.
</P>
<P>
   A wave of relief swept the stock and bond markets, which both
rallied strongly Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average advanced nearly 190 points to
10,784.95 and the Nasdaq composite, encouraged as well by a
surprisingly robust earnings report from software maker Oracle,
jumped more than 103 points to 2,517.83, surpassing its previous
record one-day point gain of 96.05, set Feb. 11. Yields on 30-year
Treasury bonds fell as soon as the report was released, ending the
day at 6.06 percent versus 6.11 late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market was expecting several tightening moves by the
Fed,'' said Paul Kasriel, chief economist at Northern Trust.
``Today's data lowers the probability.''
</P>
<P>
   A sustained campaign to raise interest rates like the one
conducted by the Fed from early 1994 to early 1995 seems much less
likely now. But most analysts say the Fed will probably engineer a
modest one quarter percentage point rate increase at the end of its
June 29-30 meeting. Not only have several voting members of the
Fed's Open Market Committee been making hawkish noises in public
lately, but all indications are that the economy is still growing
too fast for the Fed's comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, is
scheduled to testify on the economy Thursday to a congressional
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are still very confused and very cautious,'' said Bruce
Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch. ``Everyone knows
Greenspan is talking tomorrow and everybody expects him to give us
to word.''
</P>
<P>
   To most Americans basking in the lowest unemployment and
inflation since the 1960s, the notion that the Fed is fretting
about a revival of inflation may seem puzzling, if not outlandish.
But if the central bank waits for actual inflation to take off,
analysts warn, it has probably waited too long. Fed actions may
affect stock and bond prices instantly, but they take a lot longer
_ a year or more _ to work their way through the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed is worrying about what the CPI will do six to 12
months down the road,'' said Nicholas Perna, chief economist at the
Fleet Bank.
</P>
<P>
   When Fed officials issued a list of their concerns on April 18
in disclosing that their next move was more likely to be up than
down, there was no mention of current inflation at all. Instead,
the Fed focused on factors that are affecting the speed of the
8-year-old expansion: strong domestic demand, tight labor markets
and economic recoveries abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the government has released more data suggesting
that the economy is not slowing down as much as expected. The news
Wednesday only added more fuel to that fire. Housing starts rose
6.3 percent in May after a sharp drop in April, the Census
Department reported. And the Fed said that factory output climbed
for the fourth consecutive month in May as manufacturers churned
out more cars and computers. Last week, there was fresh evidence
that Germany and Japan were on the road to recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several forces that have helped restrain inflation
are fading. Oil prices, which plummeted during the Asian crisis,
have climbed recently. The increases have leveled off in the past
six weeks or so, but as the rest of the world begins growing again
further increases are likely. The same is true for the prices of
industrial commodities like copper and aluminum, which are still
depressed but have been rising recently at the fastest pace in more
than two years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are remarkably few signs of the usual precursors of
a sustained pick-up in inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Wage increases, which have been averaging just under 4 percent
for the past four years, have not accelerated; if anything, they
appear to have slowed a bit recently. Perhaps even more
surprisingly, productivity gains, which usually peter out as
economic expansions get older, have sped up. Last quarter,
productivity was up 2.7 percent from a year earlier, and over the
past four years productivity growth has averaged 2 percent, twice
the rate of the previous two decades.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, labor costs per unit of output have been rising
more slowly during this expansion than during any since the 1940s.
They were up just 1.4 percent in the first quarter. Moreover,
American industry, in the wake of a huge investment boom, has a lot
of excess capacity. Even though industrial production has been
rising, the utilization rate is still below 80 percent.

<P>
   ``Producers would like to raise prices, but I'm not sure they
can on a steady basis,'' said Katherine Kobe, an economist at Joel
Popkin Associates, an economic forecasting firm based in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Low inflation is giving consumers plenty to celebrate. In May,
the price of moving around fell. Gasoline prices, which accounted
for half of April's surge in consumer prices, fell 1.3 percent
after soaring 15 percent in April. Air fares dropped too, partly
because fuel prices were flat. And despite near record car sales,
the prices of new and used models also declined.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing also got cheaper, as it had been doing for some time
until April. That is partly because so much of it is imported and
partly because a lot of the fabrics, including new synthetics from
Asia, are too.
</P>
<P>
   The price of shelter fell as well.
</P>
<P>
   Computers continued to get cheaper, too, down nearly 2 percent
last month. So far this year, computer prices have been falling at
an annual rate of more than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important given the graying of America, is that
increases in the price of medical care, which had been rising
briskly of late, slowed in May.
</P>
<P>
   Some things that have been bargains did get more expensive last
month, however. Food prices jumped 0.6 percent as dairy products,
fruits and vegetables, which usually decline in price in late
spring, rose more than they usually do at this time of year.

   SLA-FUGITIVE (Los Angeles) _ A former Symbionese Liberation Army
member who grew up in Palmdale, Calif., and has been on the lam for
more than 20 years and arrested in St. Paul, Minn., today is
expected to be sent back to Los Angeles eventually to face state

   LA-CHARTER (Los Angeles) _ A key component of the voter-approved

   LATE-LETTER (Los Angeles) _ When an old, browning envelope with
a 3-cent stamp on it arrived in the mail addressed to him and his
wife, Tujunga resident Robert J. Davis knew something was wrong
when he looked at the postmark. It read: ``Winsted, Conn., June 6,
1950.'' ``That was five years before I was even born,'' said the
44-year-old roofer. ``It's kind of weird that I got a letter sent
50 years ago addressed to our address and sent five years before I
was born.'' When he and his wife read the letter, they realized the
tragic reality of a letter lost in the mail for nearly a half
century. The author had written to her daughter and son-in-law to
say she might die at any time and wanted them to come visit her in
Connecticut. It was a letter her daughter and son-in-law never

 &HT;    Problems called part of political tapestry

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The harsh reaction in Europe to the Coca-Cola health
scare should be seen in the context of politics and not as part of
a wave of anti-Americanism, experts said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't jump to the idea that sees this as an attack on a
multinational,'' said Robert B. Zoellick, counselor and
undersecretary for economic and agriculture affairs at the State
Department during the Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   Zoellick, now with the Washington-based Center for Strategic and
International Studies, attributed Belgium's quick ban on Coke
products to rising concern in Europe about food poisoning and
environmental issues that began with the 1995 mad cow disease scare
in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the Belgian government of Prime Minister Jean-Luc
Dehaene was voted out of office only Sunday after mishandling
revelations that cancer-causing dioxin had entered the food chain
through animal feed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're (Europeans) very jittery,'' added John McIntyre,
director of the Georgia Tech Center for International Business
Education and Research.
</P>
<P>
   Bromis Verhage, marketing professor at Georgia State University,
agreed that Monday's ban on all Coke products by Belgium's Health
Ministry was a ``very predictable reaction, given that the prime
minister had to step down after a similar problem.''
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre added that the Coke ban is part of a ``power play''
between national governments and the European Union's consumer
affairs commission over control of food regulations. The Belgian
government apparently moved decisively with the expectation that
the EU would act if it didn't, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, McIntyre said, Coca-Cola's relations with the Europeans
were already strained. The Atlanta-based company has angered the EU
by trying to ``pick off one country at a time'' with proposed
acquisitions of beverage operations, instead of going to the
European Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Verhage said Coca-Cola's management had also shown a ``lack of
sensitivity'' by not taking decisive action more quickly after
initial reports that 100 Belgian schoolchildren had take ill, given
the fact that ``the whole country is sensitive to food poisoning.''
</P>
<P>
   Other companies should learn from Coke's experience, he said.
``It seems that every company should pull out its crisis plan and
be very sensitive when problems like this occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Zoellick added, ``The basis lesson is react quickly to restore
public confidence.

   PATRES, Yugoslavia _ After a tense standoff along a rural road,
with helicopter gunships overhead, American marines confiscated the
weapons of more than 100 ethnic Albanian insurgents and detained
six of their leaders Wednesday in the most serious of a series of
confrontations between NATO troops and the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   The confiscation of the weapons _ including AK-47s, mines and
rocket-propelled grenades _ came as NATO commanders scrambled to
control the insurgents' increasingly open and brash exercising of
power in Kosovo as the Yugoslav Army and police withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials met with leaders of the Kosovo Liberation Army in
Albania to try to arrange the details of disbanding _ or
``demilitarizing'' _ the group and turning its fighters into a
civilian police force for the province.
</P>
<P>
   Under a plan drawn up in Belgium by the staff of NATO's
commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, the rebels would have to withdraw
from fortified positions held during the war against President
Slobodan Milosevic's forces, turn over their heavy weapons and
disband in two phases over 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO official said Wednesday night that the commander of the
peacekeeping operation, Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson of Britain,
expected to announce an agreement soon, but that details needed to
be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA's leaders have pledged to cooperate with NATO's
peacekeepers, but they have not shown much inclination to break up
their insurgency _ just as it has become the dominant political and
military force among Kosovo's Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   In town after town, including the capital, Pristina, the KLA's
presence has grown each day, with their red and black flags
adorning ``official'' buildings and their armed soldiers openly
patrolling villages.
</P>
<P>
   The company of insurgents had just paraded through the village
of Zegra, on their way to Gnjilane, when troops from the 26th
Marine Expeditionary Unit confronted them early Wednesday morning a
few miles to the north. Capt. David Eiland, commander of Company K,
said he first asked them to turn over their weapons voluntarily,
beginning two hours of tense negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   When they continued to refuse, he ordered them surrounded and,
with Apache and Cobra helicopter gunships hovering overhead,
arrested six of the company's officers.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until eight hours after the confrontation began that
the insurgents complied. ``We pretty much insisted they turn them
over,'' Eiland said of the weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Bruce Gandy, the commander of the Marine ground force
based at a chicken hatchery and slaughterhouse on a hill outside
this village, said Wednesday evening that NATO would release the
detained officers but would destroy the confiscated weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday, NATO's interaction with the KLA has been
largely cordial and tolerant. The rebels view NATO as an ally in
their struggle to win freedom for Kosovo's predominantly Albanian
population, and they have generally cooperated with the
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO's commanders here have pledged to be evenhanded in
securing peace in Kosovo after more than a year of civil war and 78
days of NATO air strikes. That also means protecting Kosovo's
Serbs. With the insurgents manning checkpoints in cities like
Cacanik, Suva Reka and Prizren, and opening offices in the capital,
thousands of Serbs have crammed their belongings in cars and fled,
saying they feared reprisals from the rebels, whom they view as
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The anxiety among Serbs has grown sharply as the last of the
Serbian-dominated Army and special police units withdrew from a
large swath of Kosovo, following NATO's demands for a phased
withdrawal by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase of that withdrawal was supposed to have been
complete on Tuesday night, but NATO granted a 24-hour extension,
saying that the Yugoslav Army was making a concerted effort to
leave but faced enormous logistical challenges withdrawing some
40,000 soldiers and police officers.
</P>
<P>
   A convoy of military vehicles left Pristina at noon Wednesday,
escorting nearly as many civilian vehicles. When asked where she
was going, a woman in one of the cars said simply, ``We don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Army headquarters in Pristina's center, a Serbian woman,
Verica Trajkovic, scolded one of the few soldiers who remained.
``You are leaving us alone,'' she said. ``What are we going to do
without anyone to protect us?''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's commander in Kosovo, Jackson, has repeatedly tried to
assuage such fears, though with little success. On Wednesday, he
met with a large group of Serbs in Kosovo Polje, west of the
capital, and told them the terms for ending NATO's war against
Yugoslavia required the rebel group to be disbanded as an organized
fighting force.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement now being negotiated would more or less mirror the
agreement signed by leaders of Kosovo's Albanians in Paris in
March. It would require the rebels, now thought to number as many
as 17,000, to disband within a month and start training to become a
police force for the province.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase of the agreement would require the rebels to
respect a cease-fire with the retreating Serbs and keep a little
more than a mile from them. They would also have to stay the same
distance away from the main roads and from the peacekeepers, a NATO
official in Brussels said.
</P>
<P>
   Within four days, the rebels would withdraw from the fortified
positions they held during the conflict. In a second phase, which
would begin after seven days, the rebels would begin turning over
heavy weapons.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 30 days, they would have to disband, ceasing
organized maneuvers and other operations and shedding their
uniforms. The agreement would also require any mercenaries or
volunteers from other countries to leave Kosovo.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A major problem in negotiating with the KLA is its opaque
command structure and internal divisions. The group has autonomous
commanders in different regions who have not always been willing to
let the man whom allied officials consider their leader, Hashim
Thaci, speak for them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to get something like the military technical
agreement we have with the Serb forces,'' the NATO official in
Brussels said, ``but a major question is whom do you talk to.''
</P>
<P>
   The company confronted Wednesday, which had 116 soldiers,
appeared to be highly organized, disciplined and armed. ``It was an
organized unit,'' said Gandy. ``And they were loaded for bear.''
</P>
<P>
   Their weapons, when stacked in a pile at the marines' camp near
the village of Patres, reached waist high. In all, the marines
confiscated 105 rifles, some 10,000 rounds of ammunition and 45
grenades. There were two Dragonoff sniper rifles, one with a
silencer, as well as land mines and TNT, presumably for ambushing
Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   First Sgt. Steve Campbell, the squad leader of Delta Company,
which guarded a checkpoint during the confrontation, said the
confiscation could affect what had been a peaceful coexistence in
the first days of NATO's operation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're going to be a lot less friendly now,'' he
said.

QUAKE SURVIVORS RELIEVED THAT LOSS WASN'T GREATER

   PUEBLA, Mexico _ Hardly anyone uses this city's old colonial
name anymore: Puebla de los Angeles _ Village of the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the 1.2 million Pueblans said it must have been
divine intervention that spared them from a potentially
catastrophic earthquake on Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely a miracle that there was not more death and
damage,'' Josefina Zacula de Guerrero, 65, said Wednesday while
standing near a church whose steeple had been toppled by the
temblor. ``It was an intense and horrible earthquake. But that's
why they say we're surrounded by angels.''
</P>
<P>
   As emergency officials and residents in six Mexican states
cleaned up from the 6.8 magnitude earthquake, there were sighs of
relief that the rattle didn't cause more destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The official death toll stood at 16 late Wednesday, but rescue
workers reported that nearly two dozen people died and another
200-300 were hurt, according to the Televisa television network.
About 500 buildings were seriously affected by the quake that left
about 600 homeless.
</P>
<P>
   But in an area that includes the world's largest metropolitan
area _ Mexico City, with an estimated population of 20 million _
officials concede the toll could have been disastrous. Although the
temblor shook the capital hard enough to sway buildings and send
scores of panicked residents into the streets, the hardest hit area
was Puebla, which lies about 50 miles southeast of Mexico City and
was much closer to the quake's epicenter in Oaxaca state.
</P>
<P>
   Several buildings, including the city hall, were closed to
public access Wednesday because authorities feared they had become
too unsafe. A clock on top of the municipal building remained
locked at about the same time the earthquake hit at 3:42 p.m. local
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid the building would collapse on me,'' said Lilia
Alvarez Romero, 51, an accountant at a downtown furniture store.
``And when it was all over, I couldn't walk out because there was
so much dust and yelling and screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than a block from the store where Romero works, St. Agustin
Catholic Church, a colonial, butter-colored structure, lay in
semi-ruins. The earthquake shook the building's concrete steeple,
hurling large chunks of stone to the ground. On an adjacent corner
a vacant office building showed only jagged, clear teeth where
glass windows had once been.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's salvageable, look at that tower,''
Fernando Gonzalez, a 36-year-old architect, said of steeple as he
directed a cleanup crew of troops and firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Many parts of Oaxaca state were still without potable water
Wednesday. Churches and older government buildings were seriously
affected in Morelos state. And quake-related deaths were reported
as far north and east as Hidalgo and Veracruz.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's quake instantly brought back terrifying memories of the
temblor that hit the nation in September 1985. That quake measured
8.1 on the Richter scale and claimed an estimated 10,000 lives,
mostly in Mexico City, which was hit hardest.
</P>
<P>
   For most residents in Puebla, known for its Volkswagen assembly
plant and the two volcanoes that rise only a few miles away,
Monday's quake was the most frightening one they'd felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt the one in 1985, but it wasn't as strong for us in
Puebla as this one,'' Juan Carlos Carbajal, 33, the furniture store
manager, said while standing before a wall of crucifixes and Last
Supper paintings. ``This was much harder, and scarier.''

GENZYME CREATES SURGICAL UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Genzyme Corp. is creating a separate division called Genzyme
Surgical Products, with its own stock. The shares will begin
trading on Monday, June 28.
</P>
<P>
   The change is expected to strengthen Genzyme General, the
biopharmaceutical division, which accounts for more than two-thirds
of the Cambridge company's revenues.
</P>
<P>
   By spinning out its surgical devices and biomaterials, Genzyme
has put a spotlight on the disappointing sales and lack of profits
from its nonpharmaceutical business.
</P>
<P>
   Genzyme Surgical is primarily the products and assets of
Deknatel Snowden Pencer Inc., the Taunton, Mass. developer of
instruments for minimally invasive cardiac surgery and specialty
surgical products that Genzyme acquired in July 1996 for $250
million in cash. The diversification into surgical products was
designed to give Genzyme a 52-person US sales force and jump-start
sales of Seprafilm, a thin bioengineered film surgeons apply to
traumatized organs to reduce adhesions after surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But three years later, sales of both the surgical hardware and
Seprafilm are well below Wall Street expectations. Merrill Lynch &AMP;
Co., for example, predicted that surgical products revenues in 1998
would reach $320 million, much of it from Seprafilm. Instead,
Genzyme this week reported revenues were $104 million last year _
up from $100.8 million in 1997. The division also lost nearly $50
million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting the surgical products operations into a separate group
will improve the operating leverage of Genzyme General,'' said Meg
Malloy, biotechnology analyst for Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. ``Surgical
products won't be profitable for several years, and it sort of
diminished and detracted from the high margins on Genzyme's
therapeutic drug business.''
</P>
<P>
   Since existing Genzyme shareholders will own the bulk of Genzyme
Surgical, the division's shares are known as a ``tracking'' stock,
with a separate price determined on June 28 and traded on the
Nasdaq stock exchange. Genzyme has created several other tracking
stocks from such divisions as Genzyme Tissue Repair and Genzyme
Molecular Oncology for fledlging research and development projects
uniquely different from the company's bread and butter
biopharmaceutial products.
</P>
<P>
   Genzyme said it will provide $150 million to Genzyme Surgical
through 2001 to fund the division's operations.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHOLULA, Mexico _ The friar was climbing up the steep steps to
his church for afternoon prayers Tuesday when the belltowers began
to sway and the great bells set to tolling by themselves. As he
watched, ugly cracks coursed across the front facade, then half of
it collapsed with a crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to recognize that many of the buildings worst hit by
the quake were churches,'' the friar, the Rev. Benjamin Balcazar
Rodriguez, said sadly Wednesday as he carried cardboard boxes
filled with dusty vestments and figurines of saints from the
rubble-strewn church. ``Considering how much evil there is in the
world these days, I have to think this is God calling us to pay
more attention to His holy places.''
</P>
<P>
   The earthquake, which struck central Mexico at 3:42 p.m.
Tuesday, took many fewer lives than many people who felt its
rocking punch _ a magnitude of 6.7 on the standard seismic scale _
thought it would. By the latest official count, 16 people perished
under falling roofs and walls, and dozens were injured.
</P>
<P>
   But since the quake struck the same part of the country that
lived through the hugely destructive Mexico City earthquake of
1985, this one had a powerful psychological impact, reawakening
fears Mexicans had put to rest.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the sense of loss, some of this quake's most
conspicuous victims were churches. At least 32, including several
much-visited Spanish colonial gems, were hurt in Puebla state, on
one side of the epicenter. For many Mexicans, with their strong
Catholic faith, relief that the death toll is not higher is mixed
with sadness for the damage to their shrines.
</P>
<P>
   Cholula, with only 10,000 inhabitants, is believed to have more
Catholic churches than any other small town in Mexico, some 70 in
all. And Friar Balcazar's mustard-colored church, with its mighty
wooden portal and white stucco columns, is the most renowned.
Spanish missionaries, eager to show their spiritual superiority,
erected it in 1594 at the very top of a 200-foot-high ancient
pyramid, the largest one built by Mexico's pre-Columbian ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   Descendants of both Spaniards and Indians have flocked to the
church because it is the home of Our Lady of Healing, an image of
Mary that has been credited with curing all manner of illnesses and
lending a hand with seemingly insoluble personal problems as well.
</P>
<P>
   When the quake struck, a few people were tending a store for
tourists at one side of the church. The adobe ceiling crumbled
around them but everyone got out without injury. A statue of Saint
Francis, for whom the church is named, keeled to one side in its
niche high above the altar but did not fall out.
</P>
<P>
   To the 51-year-old caretaker, Pedro Tenahua, it was no accident
that the church's most sacred figures were spared. ``After all,
this is God's sacred place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But both side wings were battered beyond repair and the church
has been closed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Worried followers of Our Lady of Healing gathered at the base of
the pyramid. One pilgrim who had made a daylong journey to come to
pray that his wife's injured back be healed was deeply distressed
to learn that he could not enter the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why the churches? Why the churches?'' Cristina Toxqui, 38,
another worshiper, fretted out loud. ``People don't respect each
other anymore. This is a warning from God that we need to treat
each other better as human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in town, fissures split the facade of the the church
of San Andres de Cholula, whose construction was completed in 1730,
and the glorious yellow-tiled dome plunged to the ground. Julia
Moreno Rodriguez, 75, was in the back praying when the dome
thundered and fell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just sat where I was,'' Mrs. Moreno said. ``I said, if God
wants me to die today, I would like it to happen in his temple.''
She was not hurt.
</P>
<P>
   In Puebla, a city of 1.2 million 60 miles east of Mexico City
whose impeccably preserved colonial center is a United Nations
World Heritage Site that draws a flow of tourists, the church of
Saint Augustine also lost its dome. At least nine other churches
were among the 80 public buildings damaged in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Walls collapsed inside the colonial-era city hall, and at least
120 other buildings in the city were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Pacheco, the director of Mexico's National Seismological
Service, said the earthquake did not inflict more damage because
the soil of Puebla is rockier than the loamy former lake bed
underneath Mexico City. Also, the epicenter was deep underground,
and the duration was relatively brief, not more than 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico City, two people died of heart failure brought on by
the shaking, but material damage was slight.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with so many residents consumed with anxiety after
reliving the terror of 1985, President Ernesto Zedillo continued
Wednesday to oversee the reconstruction effort personally. He
declared Puebla state a disaster area.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Emigdio Palacios, the parish priest of the church of
San Andres de Cholula, said he was certain the dome would be
rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   As he gazed up through the yawning hole in the arched roof, he
said philosophically, ``This is one way for us to lift our eyes to
Heaven.''

PRESSURE IS ON U.S. TEAM
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   It looks like FIFA Women's World Cup officials will get their
wish for a packed house when the United States takes on Norway on
Saturday in the tournament opener at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. press officer Aaron Heifetz announced that 71,000 tickets
have been sold for the opener, just 6,000 short of capacity. The
doubleheader, featuring Mexico against Brazil in the second game,
likely will be sold out by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, for one, knew if this team was marketed properly, there
would be plenty of support,'' said U.S. goalkeeper Briana Scurry
during a conference call from the team's training center in New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw all of the support for women's soccer during the
Olympics in Atlanta. What you're seeing now is another sign that
all of that support is out there. Not just for women's soccer but
for women's sports in general.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. coach Tony DiCicco is frequently asked how his team handles
the pressure of being the overwhelming tournament favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you go into a world-class event, there are
expectations,'' he said. ``Sometimes those expectations are
redefined as pressure. Hey, every team has pressure. For some
teams, it might be to win a game or reach the second round, but I
like our (pressure) better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the expectations to win it all. There are plenty of
outstanding teams in this tournament, but this is our opportunity
to show the world this team and how serious we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Midfielder Kristine Lilly isn't concerned about the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've learned is that if we play our best and we stay
focused, then everything else gets taken care of,'' Lilly said.
``With this World Cup, there's a lot of pressure from the outside
because we want to start a pro league. But we can't worry about
that now. Our goal is to win this tournament and if that happens,
positive things are going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the reporters on Tuesday's conference call wondered what
DiCicco thought of Nigeria's 4-3 victory over China in a friendly
at West L.A. College last weekend. China has had recent success
against the U.S., beating the Americans twice in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Nigerians face North Korea Sunday at the Rose Bowl, then
meet the Americans on June 24 in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, we're not preparing for Nigeria, we're preparing
for Denmark,'' said DiCicco. ``Denmark is a load and we have to be
totally focused on them, but having said that, I'm not surprised
about the Nigerian result at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of reporters were surprised, but I knew Nigeria
is very athletic, very strong and has players comfortable with the
ball. The term I've been using is they're a dangerous team.''
</P>
<P>
   Heifetz, who attended the China-Nigerian friendly, informed
DiCicco that China used its regular starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If China played them 10 times, I'm not sure how many games
Nigeria could win,'' DiCicco said. ``But on any given day, they
showed they can beat anyone. I will send both of my assistants out
to scout the Nigerian team. By the time we play them, we will be
very informed.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Nigerian players are looking forward to the U.S.
game and they're not shy about making predictions. Nigeria's Mercy
Akide is predicting an upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we beat them? Of course we can,'' she said recently.
``There is no fear in our team. And why should we fear the United
States? All the pressure is on them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are totally new to us,'' said Lilly. ``From what I hear,
they're very skilled on the ball. As far as their victory over
China, I didn't even know they were playing.''

ENERGY SECRETARY TAKES STEPS TO IMPROVE SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JEFF GERTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Energy Secretary Bill Richardson on Wednesday named
a retired four-star general to be the department's first security
czar and announced that all normal operations at three nuclear
weapons laboratories will cease for two days next week as part of
an intensive review of security.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's actions are a continuation of Richardson's recent
decision to restructure and centralize the department's far-flung
security functions. The announcements were prompted in part by two
new studies _ one in May by a congressional committee and the other
this week by a presidential advisory board _ that sharply call into
question the Energy Department's ability to properly manage
security.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the new high-level security office is Gen.
Eugene Habiger, who retired from the Air Force last year after
serving as commander in chief of the U.S. Strategic Command, where
he supervised the military's nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Habiger told reporters that the call of patriotism brought him
out of retirement to fix the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very serious problem our country is facing,'' he
said. ``When my country calls me back to do it, I'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He will face a difficult job when he begins his job July 6. The
presidential report, released Tuesday by the President's Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board, said: ``Even if the new `security
czar' is given complete authority over the more than $800 million
ostensibly allocated each year to security of nuclear
weapons-related functions in DOE, he will still have to cross
borders into other people's fiefdoms, causing certain turmoil and
infighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's other announcement Wednesday will require the
shutdown of the three principal nuclear weapons labs: Los Alamos
and Sandia in New Mexico and Lawrence Livermore in Northern
California.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, Richardson temporarily shut down the computer
networks at the labs as a security precaution. Next week's more
sweeping measure, a ``security immersion program,'' requires all
employees to participate ``in an intensive review of personal
responsibility for security, counterintelligence and
cybersecurity.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said all employees would spend the two days in
training to become familiar with the new tighter procedures on
security issues like personal computer use and electronic mail that
he has put into place in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said the move was prompted by both the advisory
board's report and May's report by the select House committee on
China's acquisition of U.S. military and nuclear technology.
</P>
<P>
   The two reports, Richardson said, showed that ``we still don't
have our act together.''
</P>
<P>
   The presidential report has also highlighted some disagreements
over what to do with the nuclear weapons complex. Noting the
department's ``organizational dysfunction'' and ``cultural
vagaries,'' the report recommended the creation of an Agency for
Nuclear Stewardship to oversee the department's nuclear
laboratories and related functions through one of two possible
organizational structures.
</P>
<P>
   One mechanism would make the newly created agency
semi-autonomous, headed by a new under secretary of energy and
answerable directly to the secretary. The other proposed structure
would create an independent agency _ like NASA _ to oversee nuclear
functions.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Richardson continued to reject the idea of a separate
agency, saying it would bifurcate security issues at nuclear and
non-nuclear facilities. ``What I don't find acceptable is a
separate agency,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he moved closer to endorsing the other proposal, which has
some support in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to accept an under secretary'' and ``work with
Congress'' to merge ``our slight differences,'' Richardson said.

   The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported this week that county
officials are investigating an incident in which  &UR; Robin Leach &LR;  and
six women did naughty things involving food and nudity at
Delmonico's steak &LR;   &LR; house in the new hotel the Venetian.
</P>
<P>
   Leach and his friends _ described as blondes in their 20s _ were
dining in a glass-enclosed private dining room in the middle of the
hotel's kitchen. The alleged revelers are said to have employed
whipped dream and chocolate sauce in their frolics. Leach is said
to have urged kitchen workers to watch and applaud the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The incident caused employees to complain that being subjected
to such goings-on constituted harassment. The county got involved
because it has jurisdiction over the restaurant's liquor license.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at the hotel refused to comment, but Leach told the
New York Daily News that the incident was just ``a harmless, fun
whip-cream fight that lasted less than two minutes.''

</P>
<P>
   Each ketubah includes traditional Jewish design elements, the

CHAIN GANG INMATES SAVOR THE SIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RIC KAHN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BEDFORD, Mass. _ For Lawrence Woodsum, 26, degradation was
not being an inaugural member of the state's first chain gang
Wednesday, shackled ankle-to-ankle to four other inmates holding
paintbrushes like a bunch of tethered pre-schoolers.
</P>
<P>
   Real humiliation, Woodsum said, was found on the road to prison
itself: smoking crack, stealing vegetables, sleeping on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Woodsum and nine other convicts in blazing red jumpsuits
Wednesday ignored the watchful eyes of armed guards and gawkers and
behaved like Red Sox rookies at spring training: sucking in fresh
air, gaping at a new make of car they hadn't seen since they were
incarcerated, and checking out ``the chicks'' driving by.
</P>
<P>
   In one measure of how lousy life must be in the Dartmouth House
of Correction, another prisoner likened the chain gang to the
feeling he gets in the company of a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Amen, Woodsum added. ``It's freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   If only for five hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   The Bristol County chain gang, two teams of five shackled
inmates, scraped and painted the wrought-iron fence surrounding a
county correctional substance-addiction center run by the sheriff
(New Bedford city officials have barred chaing gangs from working
on their properties.)
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the chain gangs are scheduled to build a youth ball
field in Fall River under apparent sanction of the city housing
authority, according to the sheriff's office.
</P>
<P>
   Though some on the outside view his new task as demeaning,
Woodsum said it will help him win redemption for the times he
neglected his own three children while he was out drinking and
using drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never had a father,'' said Woodsum, who went into prison
four months ago and is due out October 22, 2000. ``This is teaching
me how to work. I can better myself . . . It's better than sitting
in a cell.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the small perks the chain-gang details get: more
comfortable, dorm-style cells, extra snacks while on duty and
makeup recreation time after a hard day's work.
</P>
<P>
   But Joshua Rubenstein of Amnesty International wondered
precisely how voluntary can a decision made by an inmate be.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always different kinds of incentives or disincentives
involved, especially when it's the pet project of the warden,''
said Rubenstein, the group's northeast regional director.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the sheriff is looking to nurture a sense of teamwork,'' he
asked, ``why doesn't he teach them synchronized swimming?''
</P>
<P>
   Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson has a simple response: he
is trying to instill inmates with a sense of discipline and civic
duty and give the taxpayers a return on their dollars. Besides,
Hodgson said, only 12 out of about 100 eligible inmates _ those
with at least 15 months left to serve, a clean disciplinary record
and no sex offenses _ volunteered for the duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mr. Rubenstein wants to, he can ask these people if they're
not volunteering and being forced,'' said Hodgson. ``I can't be
sidetracked by people who are uninformed.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodgson and Rubenstein will debate next week in Dartmouth, one
of many municipalities that want to explore the issue in public
before reaching a decision. Other municipalities in Brisol County
have rejected the work details.
</P>
<P>
   Though some state legislators vow to outlaw the chain gangs as
inhumane, inmate Kevin McKee said he doesn't mind being a public
spectacle in a jumpsuit with ``Sheriff's Tandem Work Crew'' written
in big white letters across the back _ especially if it keeps at
least one kid straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we don't want you to do when you grow up,'' said
McKee, 39, who was incarcerated in December and due to be released
next year after four drunken driving offenses.
</P>
<P>
   As the crews worked outside, two burly, unshackled inmates
passed by and sneered at the leg chains. One agreed that the sight
reminded him of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he said, ``That sucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, says McKee.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's chains in prison,'' he says. ``You just don't see
them.''

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Not every Tom Ammiano idea rattles the
seismically retrofitted corridors of City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few months ago, when a fitness club put up a billboard
advertisement that said when aliens land ``they'll eat the fat ones
first,'' Ammiano sat in his lofty oak perch at the San Francisco
Board of Supervisors' chambers and pronounced that the city should
amend its law banning discrimination against race, religion,
ancestry, sex, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability
and place of birth to include persons who are overweight.
</P>
<P>
   Presto. It was as good as done.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, however, the president of the governing body for the
nation's most famously liberal city arrives at weekly supervisors'
meetings armed with far more radical proposals, ideas to change
life in this city that leave his colleagues on the board frozen and
mute, as though they had crossed paths with a bear.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when no self-preserving big-city politician will admit
to being a die-hard liberal, when they will bend their sentences
into pretzels to avoid the phrase, Ammiano has emerged as a proud
New Deal big government do-gooder, a throwback to the days when
``liberal'' was a description, not an epithet.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano, a 57-year-old former special education teacher and gay
stand-up comedian who bills himself as ``the Queen of Gay Comedy,''
could be the most powerful big-city liberal in the country. More
and more, people here are urging him to challenge the man who now
pulls the levers in San Francisco, Mayor Willie L. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano's recent proposals read like a working man's wish list.
His ``living wage'' proposal would set a minimum salary of $11 an
hour plus benefits for city workers and employees of contractors
that do business with San Francisco, which would make the city's
minimum wage the highest in the country. His proposal to grant city
employees a year of paid parental leave, if adopted, would be
another national first. He is still trying to find a way to propose
a way around the state's ban on commercial rent controls so that,
he said, ``small mom-and-pop stores wouldn't be put out of business
by big rich chain stores.''
</P>
<P>
   What seems more amazing than the ideas themselves is that people
are taking them seriously. Of course, this is San Francisco. It may
be verboten for politicians in most places to acknowledge they are
left of center, but here it is practically a prerequisite for
office. Still, San Francisco's liberalism is generally practiced in
the dutiful way of people who attend church because they grew up
with it. Ammiano is an old-fashioned liberal, a fire and brimstone
preacher bent on changing the sinners' ways.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, after months of issuing denials reminiscent of President
George Bush's pledge of ``no new taxes,'' Ammiano has started
saying that he is ``looking into the possibility'' of challenging
the once omnipotent mayor, whose approval rating has slipped to 30
percent in the latest public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you keep hearing people say, `Do it,' and you keep seeing
`Run Tom Run' buttons everywhere you go, you start thinking about
it,'' Ammiano said recently from his office in the majestic
beaux-arts building that is City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lately, there's been a lot of what I call raging moderates on
the board,'' he added. ``I've had to go out on a limb on a lot of
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is giving him a free ride. Arguably his biggest success
to date is a 1996 ordinance that requires contractors who do
business with the city to provide the same benefits to employees'
domestic partners as to spouses. More recently, he succeeded in
convincing voters to change the way supervisors are elected _ from
citywide to districtwide elections. But his top priorities, like
his living-wage proposal, have yet to make it past his colleagues.
Last month the board voted to table the proposal until an
open-ended study could assess its costs, which Ammiano estimates at
about $25 million and critics put at more than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   He blames a board beholden to the mayor, who has appointed six
members (due to vacancies). ``What it really reflects is a
disconnect,'' Ammiano said, ``between a liberal, good-government
electorate and the board.''
</P>
<P>
   But editorial writers are also having a ball satirizing his
loftier ideas. ``We should all help Tom fight his addiction,'' The
San Francisco Examiner wrote in a May 7 editorial headlined, ``I'm
Tom and I'm a big spender,'' which criticized his proposal for paid
parental leave.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano said that those who question how much his
pro-working-class proposals will cost never ask that question when
the city doles out tax breaks to corporations.
</P>
<P>
   No one questions his popularity _ his fans fill the weekly board
meetings, as though they were watching a show _ but he is still not
popular enough to become mayor, said Ken Garcia, a columnist for
The San Francisco Chronicle. ``The far left is still too left to
select the mayor of San Francisco,'' he wrote in a recent column,
``though he might have enough support (if others jump in the race)
to force our lord mayor into a runoff.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Ammiano is not so different from other members
of the board, although he speaks in a nasal squeak that can become
alarmingly shrill. He is not the only openly gay member of the
board, nor is he its only openly ``progressive'' member.
</P>
<P>
   But he is the one who consistently comes up with one radical
proposal after another. On Monday, he began a new practice of
moving the time and place of board meetings, from afternoons in a
hallowed chamber at City Hall to evenings at neighborhood community
centers. The change, he said, will give residents a chance to see
their representatives in action, and prepare them for the change to
districtwide elections next year.
</P>
<P>
   He is also the veteran politician on the board, though his own
elected experience began only nine years ago, when he was elected
to the San Francisco Board of Education, becoming president four
years later.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, veterans of the city's political slugfests say
Ammiano's ideas are rather naive. He himself says he has not
learned to compromise his dreams. ``Some things seem like they
might be a dream,'' he said. ``If you don't go forward, you'll
never know if they can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano, who lost his longtime companion to AIDS, has a teen-age
daughter he helped conceive as a sperm donor. The son of a New York
City taxi driver, he grew up in Newark, attended Seton Hall
University and moved to San Francisco in 1963. He was one of the
first openly gay comedians when he began doing stand-up routines
over 20 years ago, and still performs on occasion. Last week, he
headlined a comedy show at the city's Queer Arts Festival, where he
poked fun at himself (''he could be his own first lady,'' he said)
and the mayor. Regarding plans for the new Bay Bridge, Ammiano said
Brown's attitude is ``everyone should walk across the water _ like
I do.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The mayor is supposedly furious at Ammiano for considering a run
at his job after he endorsed Ammiano's bid for the board
presidency. Word has it that Brown's endorsement was part of a quid
pro quo designed to win an endorsement from Ammiano. Publicly,
however, Brown's response to Ammiano's possible challenge is
polite, even respectful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supervisor Ammiano is a popular, well-respected member of the
family of San Francisco's elected officials,'' said P.J. Johnston,
the mayor's campaign spokesman. ``Until he says otherwise, we'll
take him at his word that he is not running. If he does, hey, it's
an open election. It's open to all comers.''
</P>
<P>
   The only other declared candidate for mayor, Clint Reilly, a
long-time political consultant, said an Ammiano run would hurt
Willie Brown more than it would hurt him. Both, said, share the
same constituencies _ labor unions, gays and lesbians and liberals.
``I think Tom is a hard-working, honest man,'' said Reilly, who
describes himself as a moderate Democrat. ``But the fiscal
consequences of many of Tom's politically correct proposals have
alarmed many people who are worried about the city's already
bloated government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Tom is a hard-working, honest man,'' said Reilly, who
describes himself as a moderate Democrat. ``But the fiscal
consequences of many of Tom's politically correct proposals have
alarmed many people who are worried about the city's bloated
government, which already has more city workers than any other
major city in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano says he is trying to keep the working and middle classes
from fleeing a city that has become the most expensive in the
country. ``Affordable housing is our No. 1 issue,'' he said. ``The
African-American population in this city is already being
decimated.''
</P>
<P>
   He looked like the weight of the world was on his shoulders, and
at that moment it most certainly was.

EMBRACING CLINTON AT ARM'S LENGTH, GORE FORMALLY BEGINS RUN FOR
PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn.)   (With GORE-BIOBOX) 
(nk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTHAGE, Tenn. _ Against a backdrop of small-town America, Vice
President Al Gore took his first formal step out of President
Clinton's shadow Wednesday, announcing his quest for the presidency
and pledging to ``bring a new wave of fundamental change to this
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of that wave of change, he made clear both in his speech
and in earlier remarks about Clinton's impeachment, would be a
fresh moral start in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you entrust me with the presidency, I will marshal its
authority, its resources and its moral leadership to fight for
America's family,'' he said, with his own family, including his
87-year-old mother and his pregnant 25-year-old daughter, creating
a tableau behind him. ``I will take my own values of faith and
family to the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   While trying to distance himself, however, Gore at the same time
embraced all the issues that form the bedrock of Clinton's domestic
agenda. He said he wants to move more people off welfare, put more
police on the streets, expand the Family and Medical Leave Act,
make college more affordable, provide universal pre-school, protect
Social Security, help the elderly pay for prescription drugs and
raise the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have schools that instill the values and character
we need in the next generation,'' he said, saying every school in
America should be drug-free and gun-free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Families deserve refuge from a culture of violence and
mayhem,'' he said. ``I will work to give parents the ability to
protect their children from the marketing of cruelty and
degradation.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's speech was marred for several minutes by a small band of
protesters who shouted that the administration was not doing enough
to get AIDS drugs to Africa. The protesters quieted down after
several Gore supporters shouted back to drown them out.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, 51, who spent his boyhood summers on a family farm near
here, spoke in front of the bunting-draped, red brick Smith County
courthouse, where he has declared his candidacy for various offices
seven times before, first for Congress in 1976, then the Senate,
and in 1987, for president.
</P>
<P>
   In that announcement speech 12 years ago, he said he was
restless, and he said so again Wednesday _ restless to enact
specific legislation that at once expands Clinton's agenda but
departs from his presidency in being guided by moral constancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our own lives we must master if we are to have the moral
authority to guide our children,'' he said. ``No policy proposal
can change a culture that does not place family life at the top of
our hierarchy of values, where it belongs.''
</P>
<P>
   If he was distancing himself from Clinton on the character
issue, Gore also signaled to reporters earlier that he might begin
to distance himself on policy matters as well. In fact he said he
had had many such disagreements with Clinton in the past, but
preferred to debate them in private.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to reveal what he and the president had disagreed
on, but he told reports Tuesday in Tennessee, ``Everything changes
when I become a candidate because I'll be describing my own vision
of the future. If that happens to be different in some respects
from what the administration wants, then I think that is
understandable.''
</P>
<P>
   Picking up on a theme espoused by his wife, Tipper, he said he
wanted health care plans to cover mental illness just as they cover
physical illness. He said he wanted to make it easier for the
elderly to receive health care in their own homes.
</P>
<P>
   The thrust of Gore's speech was that by virtue of his
experience, he was the candidate most prepared to lead the country
and to maintain the record-breaking economic expansion of the last
several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to keep our prosperity going, and I know how to do
it,'' he asserted, without elaboration but with one of several digs
at Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican front-runner, and
Bush's platform of ``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to do it the right way,'' Gore said, ``not by letting
people fend for themselves, or hoping for crumbs of compassion, but
by giving people the skills and knowledge to succeed in their own
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore emphasized his experience in foreign policy in a world he
called ``complex and volatile,'' and said, ``You deserve a leader
who has been tested in it.''
</P>
<P>
   He also spoke a few sentences in Spanish, directly competing
with Bush, who is fluent in Spanish, in his appeal to Hispanic
voters, who make up an important swing constituency.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore made a straightforward declaration of support for
abortion rights, with a veiled reference to Bush's more ambiguous
comments. ``Some try to duck the issue of choice,'' he said. ``Not
me.''
</P>
<P>
   He also set up a contrast with Bush over the emotional issue of
access to guns. ``While some want to pass new protections for gun
manufacturers, to shield them from lawsuits,'' Gore said, ``I will
work to get guns off the streets, out of the schools and away from
children and criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   The 25-minute speech was notable for its specificity across a
range of issues, and its scant mention of Clinton. Gore said on
Tuesday that his announcement speech was his chance to step out on
his own, and he made that evident in his repeated emphasis on moral
leadership Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But he was most explicit when speaking to reporters the night
before, when he landed in Tennessee. He talked about ``that awful
year we went through,'' referring to the yearlong impeachment
ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was most upsetting about it,'' Gore told reporters, was
``the wasted time. I'm even more anxious to move forward swiftly to
make up for that waste of time. We shouldn't have had to go through
it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gore has said _ and repeated Wednesday night in a taped
interview on the ABC News program ``20/20'' _ that Clinton's
behavior was inexcusable, he had not said publicly before that he
was upset over the time that was squandered. During the impeachment
scandal, Gore stood loyally behind the president and declined to
criticize him.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton, who left Wednesday for a weeklong trip to Europe,
called Gore in the morning to wish him luck before the speech and
called him again after he saw it on television. Gore was out
shaking hands and Clinton left a message, saying ``Great job, Al.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's formal declaration, of surprise to no one, is unusually
early in the campaign season for an incumbent vice president. But
he was driven by competitive pressures from Bush, and his speech
Wednesday had the feel of a general election campaign, even though
Gore still faces a primary fight for the Democratic nomination from
former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHOW HOUSE LEADERS MISSED THE BOAT ON BULL
MARKET  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Fla., Ill., Mo., Ga., Calif.)  By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While many of their constituents have enriched
themselves by investing in the booming stock market, several of the
House's most powerful members have missed out entirely on the
decade's bull market.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, and Rep. Bill
C.W. Young of Florida, the Appropriations Committee chairman, have
invested virtually none of their annual salaries in stocks, bonds
or mutual funds, according to their 1998 financial disclosure
statements, which were made public Wednesday. Armey earns $151,800
a year and Young's salary is $136,700.
</P>
<P>
   The minority leader, Dick Gephardt of Missouri, listed only one
investment on his financial disclosure statement: a growth and
income mutual fund that he estimated was worth $1,001 to $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Dennis Hastert also chose to invest almost nothing in
the stock market. His assets are in real estate. Hastert listed his
half interest in the ``opera house'' building in Plainfield, Ill.
The building once housed a theater and his father's restaurant. He
valued it at $100,001 to $250,000. He also valued his 270-acre farm
in Shipman, Ill., at $100,001 to $250,000, and he said the farm
produced income of $15,001 to $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, the House's
third-ranking Republican, may have surprised the House clerk when
he initially reported that his wife, Christine, owned Exxon stock
valued in excess of $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   It was an error, which DeLay corrected in an amended statement
10 days later. DeLay reported that the Exxon stock, which he owned
jointly with his wife, was worth $50,000 to $100,000. They sold the
stock last year.
</P>
<P>
   A review Wednesday of nearly 300 financial disclosure statements
shows that the House's reputation as the poorer cousin of the
Senate may be deserved.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of members of Congress, like Bob Barr of Georgia and
Alcee L. Hastings of Florida, disclosed that their debts exceeded
their assets. Hastings, a Democrat, owes legal fees of at least
$2.2 million to several lawyers who represented him a decade ago
when he was removed from the federal bench after an impeachment
trial in which the Senate convicted him of making false statements
and seeking a bribe.
</P>
<P>
   Barr, a Republican, listed credit card debts of $15,001 to
$50,000 on his statement. A board member of the National Rifle
Association, Barr said he also went on four trips that were paid
for by the organization last year.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1970s, members of Congress and other federal
officials have been required to file financial disclosure
statements to show that they do not have holdings that pose a
conflict of interest with their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But the statements provide the public with only a general
understanding of an official's financial situation because the
ethics rules allow a broad range of their assets and income, rather
than precise numbers. The Senate's disclosure statements were made
public last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Not all House members opted out of the stock market. Many
members showed they hold a wide array of investments, including
mutual funds, bonds and individual stocks. Some members traded
heavily, and often, in Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Turner, D-Texas, disclosed that he had four investments
worth $250,001 to $500,000. In an attachment to his statement, he
included nearly 800 pages that listed hundreds of stock trades made
by his wife, who made multiple transactions on many days.
</P>
<P>
   Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., showed that she and her husband
traded many securities in Internet companies, sometimes on the same
days. Among the stocks she and her husband held jointly last year
were Egghead.com, Infoseek, PSINet Inc., Geocities and E-Trade
Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York area, one representative who is considering a
run for the Senate, Rick Lazio, a Republican, was an active trader
of securities. He traded both stocks and options in a wide range of
companies, including Nike, Compaq and Sun Microsystems.

COMMENTARY: DEFENDING THE STATUS QUO 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The state of Texas is not big on protecting the rights of the
accused. And when it comes to providing lawyers for indigent
criminal defendants, it is one of the most backward states in the
Union.
</P>
<P>
   Some examples:
</P>
<P>
   _It is not uncommon for indigent defendants, some of whom are
innocent, to languish in jail for months before a lawyer is
appointed to represent them. Many Texas counties have no procedure
for the appointment of counsel before an indictment is returned.
</P>
<P>
   _A court-appointed lawyer in Brownsville who met his client for
the first time while a jury was being selected failed to present
evidence during the trial that the man was incarcerated at the time
he was supposed to have raped a child. The man was convicted,
sentenced to life in prison and served five years before a federal
judge ordered him released.
</P>
<P>
   _A severely mentally ill man accused of punching his grandfather
in the arm spent four years in jail awaiting trial in Hidalgo
County.
</P>
<P>
   _A man convicted of murder spent 10 harrowing years on death row
before a volunteer attorney investigated his alibi and won his
release.
</P>
<P>
   The problems have grown so horrible that both houses of the
state legislature have unanimously passed a bill that would make
modest improvements in the way that counsel is provided for
indigent defendants. The emphasis here is on the word modest.
Michael Sharlot, dean of the University of Texas Law School, said
the bill was designed to ``insure that minimal constitutional
requirements are met.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, the bill would require that an indigent defendant
be assigned a lawyer within 20 days after a request for counsel.
Twenty days. Most jurisdictions in the United States provide a
lawyer within 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
   But for some folks in Texas the idea of providing even minimal
constitutional protections for poor defendants is going a step too
far. And one of those folks appears to be that beacon of
compassionate conservatism _ you've heard of him _ George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   This bill, modest almost to the point of embarrassment, will
become law if Governor Bush does not veto it before Sunday. He
doesn't have to sign it. All he has to do is refrain from vetoing
it. But even though the bill, sponsored by State Senator Rodney
Ellis of Houston, has unanimously passed the Republican-controlled
Senate and the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, the
word in Austin is that Bush will veto it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we hear,'' said a spokesman for Ellis, a Democrat.
Republican sources in the state capital agreed. A Republican
legislative leader, who asked not to be quoted by name, said, ``All
signs point to a veto.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason is not much of a secret in Texas. A headline in The
Houston Chronicle on June 2 said: ``Judges let Bush know they want
bill vetoed.''
</P>
<P>
   The judges are at the core of the problem. In Texas, the lawyers
who ultimately represent the indigent are nearly always assigned by
local judges, and the judges determine their fees. Cronyism, not
competence, drives the process. Lackeys, incompetents and drunks
are among the many feeding at this trough.
</P>
<P>
   Judges in Texas are elected, and it is clear that many are
steering appointments in indigent cases to lawyers who have
contributed to their campaigns. The system is riddled with ethical
conflicts. The lawyers are too often on the side of the judges who
are their benefactors rather than the defendants they are supposed
to be representing.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis' bill would allow counties to consider other procedures
for the appointment of counsel to the indigent. The entire
legislature has signed on to that approach. But the judges standing
astride their vast patronage system are angry at this threat of
change. And they've voiced their anger to the man they hope will be
their benefactor, the governor who would be president.
</P>
<P>
   In short, a powerful special interest has spoken.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Wesevich, a lawyer who worked for several years with
indigent defendants in Texas, was dismayed at the thought that
Senator Ellis' bill might not become law. ``This reform is so
desperately needed,'' he said, ``and it is so modest, that it would
be a crying shame if the governor vetoed this legislation. I'm
saddened to hear that it might happen.''

   VLLASHNJE, Yugoslavia _ The dispossessed Albanians of Kosovo on
Wednesday began the long-awaited return to their native land,
flowing back by the thousands to looted and burned villages despite
warnings from NATO and the United Nations that their homes could be
booby-trapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``My blood does not allow me to live as a refugee any longer,''
said 28-year-old Fadil Arifi, who returned to this farm village
three miles inside the Kosovo border to find his electrical tools
stolen and his walls scrawled with extremist Serb slogans. The
Yugoslav troops who had occupied his house pulled out under the
NATO-imposed peacekeeping agreement on Monday.
</P>

   Arifi's 50-year-old mother, Ferida, wept as she crossed the
theshhold she had not seen since she took refuge with a family in
neighboring Albania 2 1/2 months ago. ``I cannot take it all into
my mind,'' she said. ``We have come home, but my brother's son is
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Kosovar Albanians are flocking back home, tens
of thousands of Serbians are taking to the roads out of fear of
deadly reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday morning an estimated 33,000 Serbs had fled and many
more were on the way, despite efforts of Yugoslav authorities and
aid agencies to convince them to stay in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do anything to the Albanian people, but I am afraid
they will not choose who to kill,'' said Diana Grcic, who was
preparing to leave Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, NATO troops now are beginning to move into the
central and northern sectors of Kosovo, according to spokesman Col.
Robin Clifford, which are the next areas, respectively, that Serb
forces must leave.
</P>
<P>
   They still must be out by the June 20 deadline set in a military
technical agreement signed by NATO and Serb generals, although the
deadline for the first phase of withdrawal was extended for a day
to expire at midnight Wednesday. The Tuesday deadline was shelved
because roads were so clogged with outgoing traffic that the troops
simply could not get out, Clifford said.
</P>
<P>
   Since entering Kosovo on Saturday, NATO peacekeepers have come
upon or heard about 90 suspected mass grave sites, said Navy Capt.
Mike Doubleday.
</P>
<P>
   In Helsinki, Finland, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
reported that after eight hours of talks with his Russian
counterpart that they made ``some agreements in some areas'' toward
resolving a Russian-NATO standoff over Moscow's role in keeping the
peace in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen refused to give details, but told reporters that he and
Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev would resume their
discussions Thursday. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will
join him in Helsinki Thursday to discuss the same matters with
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
   At the Albania-Kosovo border Wednesday, it was a helter-skelter
mass return to the war-ravaged Kosovo province as ethnic Albanians
were pouring across the border at the rate of 1,000 people an hour,
according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
   A simultaneous but slower flow of refugees came from neighboring
Macedonia, but at Albania's Morini Border Crossing, road traffic
into Kosovo backed up for seven miles.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was a reversal of the same jam-packed hilltop border
checkpoint this spring where glum refugees crossed after being
driven into exile during a Yugoslav campaign of ethnic cleansing.
That campaign ended a week ago, when Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic gave in to 78 days of NATO bombing, and these same
refugees have been waiting -- some patiently, other impatiently --
to return to what's left of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting atop suitcases and sacks of foodstuffs, refugees from
Kosovo's multitude of isolated villages were mostly riding home in
the same sturdy Yugoslav-built red tractors and farm wagons they
had ridden into their refugee camps. Town-dwellers were homebound
in old Mercedes-Benz sedans, brand new BMWs, taxis, buses and even
small vegetable wagons pulled by garden ploughs.
</P>
<P>
   Just before entering Kosovo, refugees were handed one more
leaflet from UNHCR officials warning that ``everywhere in the
region there are mines and grenades all around you.''
</P>
<P>
   The one-page sheet, including a color photograph of one common
type of Serb anti-personnel grenade, which looks like a green can
of shaving soap attached to a white cloth handle. ``Don't touch it
or it can kill you,'' the leaflet warns.
</P>
<P>
   The number of those turning back from fear of mines were
negligible, however. NATO experts said Wednesday that hundreds of
thousands of land mines have been laid throughout Kosovo, with the
heaviest concentration in the southern border areas.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Serb forces put down mines, but so did the Kosovo
Liberation Army. And unexploded NATO cluster bombs pose a similar
danger.
</P>
<P>
   So far four people have been killed by land mines, but others
have been seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   As they watched the refugees pour through the checkpoint, aid
agency officials expressed alarm at seeing the exiled Kosovars
begin rushing home before mines could be removed and necessary
convoys of medicine, ready-to-eat meals, water and mobile bakeries
could be sent in.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people only have skin-deep awareness of the dangers they
are facing,'' said UNHCR spokesman Rupert Colville. ``We believe
many of the villages may be mined and booby-trapped.''
</P>
<P>
   Also watching in amazement at the frontier was a detachment of
Italian NATO troops that have been training to escort organized
columns of refugees to carefully planned refugee centers at a dozen
sites in Kosovo. The Italians expected their first refugee to enter
Kosovo on July 11 -- nearly a month after this week's unplanned
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very moved about their safety,'' said Lt. Col. Franco
A. Pischedda of the Italian Caribinieri detachment. He said that
the refugees staying at the big Italian-run refugee camp in Kukes
have so far not begun moving home, ``but we don't know how long
they will stay.''
</P>
<P>
   A trickle of refugees, almost all men, began crossing into
Kosovo on Monday and Tuesday to survey their towns and villages and
then to return to Albania to inform their families.
</P>
<P>
   UNHCR officials noticed that whole families began crossing into
Kosovo late Tuesday, and spokesman Colville said ``this morning
(Wednesday) the floodgates opened.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with scores of returning Kosovars showed that most
were bound for towns and villages close to the Albanian border.
Whether the mass flow will continue in coming days to the more
heavily populated towns deeper inside Kosovo was unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those interviewed crossing from Albania said they had
lived with relatives or in rented apartments rather than refugee
camps. One notable exception were more than 1,000 refugees from the
United Arab Emirates' refugee camp in Kukes, who left the camp en
masse on Wednesday and flooded across the frontier waving flags of
the UAE.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs, meanwhile, were leaving Kosovo en masse. Men were loading
couches and washing machines and other possessions into a van
parked outside the residential hotel where the Krajina Serbs have
lived since they came here.
</P>
<P>
   They said they were determined to leave Kosovo by June 20, the
deadline for Yugoslav Serbian military and interior police forces
to withdraw from Kosovo. They fear the celebrations of ethnic
Albanians marking the end of Serb domination could turn from
exuberant to violent.
</P>
<P>
   None of those interviewed seemed to know exactly where the road
out of Kosovo would lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we consider ourselves like the wandering Jews, people who
have terrible experiences wherever they go,'' said Milos Mazibrada,
a third year medical student. ``My future is only one day at a
time.''
</P>
<P>
   At Pristina University, dormitory manager Very Denatovic(CQ
both) said she was expecting 4,000 Serbs from Prizren to come
sometime in the night. The school was thrown open to transiting
refugees several nights ago, and the International Committee of the
Red Cross is supplying food to help the moving families.
</P>
<P>
   ``If necessary we will open all the dorms because we want the
people to stay in Kosovo,'' she said. ``We'll tell them to stay
here for a while and if things get better in Prizren to go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Any hope of Serb fears being alleviated by the presence of
Russian troops was quickly dissipating.
</P>
<P>
   Between 200 and 300 Russian troops took up positions near the
Kosovo provincial capital of Pristina last Friday, hours before the
first NATO forces entered the province.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has pressed for its own sector inside Kosovo that would
be under Russian control, a position NATO has rejected. NATO's
position is that Russian troops are welcomed, but not to operate
their own sector.
</P>
<P>
   NATO fears that allowing Russia its own sector would risk
splitting Kosovo into Serb and non-Serb areas. Russia has long
historical and cultural ties to the Serbs, who dominate Yugoslavia
but make up only about 10 percent of the population in Kosovo, a
province that is part of Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia.

   KORENICA, Kosovo _ At 68, Mark Berishe, was old enough to be
spared.
</P>
<P>
   Serb troops had told him to leave his village, Korenica, and
drive to safety on a tractor with the women and children. But, he
did not know how. ``Fine,'' they said. ``Since you can't drive a
tractor, go inside with the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Against a wall in a bedroom of his nephew's luxurious country
house, he tried pleading for mercy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aren't you humans like we are? Why are you killing us like
this? Don't you have children, too?'' Berishe asked, crossing
himself in a final act of Roman Catholic faith. A Serb soldier gave
him his answer before opening fire: ``It's too late for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Berishe's skull, charred and cracked, sits amid rubble in
the corner of the bedroom with four other burned corpses. Nothing
but his silver tooth is recognizable.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor, hearing the account of Berishe's death from a nephew
who crawled from under the bodies to survive for a day, showed the
house to human rights workers and a few journalists Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   With Serb soldiers now out of the region under the agreement
that ended the 78-day NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia, the
veil is being lifted off one of the worst atrocities from the Serb
effort to drive ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   The killing took place April 27, apparently sparked by a
guerilla attack that left five Serb police dead a few days earlier.
The Serb revenge was sweeping, meticulous and grotesquely brutal.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights workers estimate that at least 100 and possibly 300
ethnic Albanians died. Along a 5-mile stretch of road where they
killing was the thickest, the mushy, putrid, stench of corpses
rises from loose piles of dirt.
</P>
<P>
   In the village of Meja, near Berishe's home, Serbs separated men
from a caravan of Kosovar Albanian refugees seeking safety over the
border in Albania. The Serbs apparently had trouble disposing of
all the victims they shot in a small field by the road.
</P>
<P>
   A rotting body, cut open and clad in a blue suit, lies in the
shrubs of a small ravine. A leg lies nearby, covered by pants and a
black shoe. Small personal items lie charred on the ground,
obviously the non-flammable remnants of a small fire. A Sharp Water
Sports watch is partly melted, but still ticks.
</P>
<P>
   The ravine, the small path and the fence match the description
given by the refugees who survived and are now in Albania. With the
Serbs leaving, the atrocities reported from afar are now being
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than we knew about,'' said Human Rights Watch's
Joanne Mariner. ``It's systematic. There were a lot of people
involved and it wasn't just some aberration that people were
killed. They pretty much had free reign to terrorize.''
</P>
<P>
   A Gypsy in a nearby town, 30-year-old Kurtesh Morini, said he
was forced by the Serbs to help dispose of bodies, as Gypsies are
often pressed into cleaning duties here. He said that often Serbs
took photographs and videotapes of their victims and recorded their
identities on lists and toe tags.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very organized,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the killings of April 27 seemed to tax even the Serb
efficiency. ``There is no list for Korenica,'' Morini said.
</P>
<P>
   The stately homes of Korenica are about a mile from Meja, and
two miles east of Djakovica. It was a neighborhood of some 700
people and most were Catholic Albanians, unlike the rest of the
province which is largely Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   The homes in fertile hills are now abandoned and burned, but it
is clear that they once looked like a postcard version of pastoral
Europe. They had white walls and Spanish tile roofs. Cherry trees
and yellow wildflowers grow in the lawns and many homes have sheds
for horses, cattle and chickens that now wander astray.
</P>
<P>
   Graffiti in English and Serbo-Croation is left behind by
withdrawing Serb troops. It screams obscenities at NATO and
American President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Dedaj, a 38-year-old ethnic Albanian, came back from his
mountain hideout four days ago and has gone from house to house. He
found the charred bodies of eight of his neighbors, including an
aunt and a godfather.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled that a few days before the Serb attack, Serb police
who live in the neighborhood had assured residents that they would
not face revenge for the policemen's deaths. Stay in your houses
and you will be alright, they told them.
</P>
<P>
   But, by this time, a month after NATO had started bombing and
the Serbs had stepped up their terror, there were few other
Albanians in the area. Perhaps that is why Korenica became a
target.
</P>
<P>
   Dedaj said that, the day before the Serb attack, seven buses of
Serb military, police and paramilitary troops arrived at a nearby
school. At 7:30 the next morning, they split into groups and fanned
out. Pairs of troops were stationed along the roads.
</P>
<P>
   Many wore sleeveless military shirts with red bandanas on their
arms. Some wore masks. He took his family to the top of the hill
and watched the Serbs approach the homes.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until later that night, though, that he heard what
happened to Mark Berishe. He heard it from Daniel Berishe, the
owner of the three-story, five-bedroom house and once a well-known
Kosovar soccer player.
</P>
<P>
   Astoundingly, Daniel, 40, was in the bedroom but only shot in
the leg. The other men fell upon him dead and he stayed still while
the Serbs laid blankets over the bodies and set them on fire.
</P>
<P>
   When the Serbs left, he escaped. With burns on his arms, he
hustled into the mountains and told the story to Dedaj. The next
morning, Serbs would find and insist on taking him away for medical
treatment. Dedaj found Daniel Berishe's body by the road a day
after that.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Dedaj walked the human rights workers around the
neighborhood. Lying in the entranceway of a house near Berishe's
are the charred remains of Dedaj's aunt, Mire Paloka.
</P>
<P>
   Her skull is cracked open exposing her burned brain. Below that
is just a twisted spine and one leg. But, Dedaj said he found her
burned rings and watch here and holds them in a dirty plastic bag.
He said his uncle's body was here, but has been taken, he's not
sure how.
</P>
<P>
   In another home, the jumbled vertebrae of an 80-year-old man lie
in a charred pile. And in another home, a few bones remain from two
men who have been buried.
</P>
<P>
   There is little property in the homes, no furniture or
appliances. Most of the interiors are burned. Occasionally, a plate
or tiny cup for sipping Turkish coffee can be seen among the
shattered roof tiles.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the items in the homes and sheds outside seem to have
been carefully dismantled or removed.
</P>
<P>
   The surviving families have fled to Europe or Albania. Dedaj's
wife and five children are in Albania. A short, muscular farmer
with chiseled features, Dedaj said he cried at the sight of his
neighbors and relatives, but he would like to go to Europe, make
some money and rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we can never be satisfied with our lives. But what
can we do?'' he said. ``The living people must go on living.''

 &HT;    MANAGUA, Nicaragua _ For Brad Booth, a former sales manager in
the United States, one factor outweighed all others in his decision
to retire in Nicaragua: price. It was not just the low cost of
living in general, as attractive here as it is in other parts of
the developing world, but the relatively cheap real estate. His eye
settled on one particular piece of property on the Pacific coast
that reminded him of San Clemente, California, where he lived for
the past 20 years.
 &HT;    ``I was really surprised, because I owned land in Roatan
(Honduras and in Belize.) But here you can buy land for much less
than in other Central American countries,'' says Booth, 58, as he
rests in a hammock on the terrace of his home. ``The real estate
market here reminds me of what it was like in Costa Rica 20 years
ago.''
 &HT;    Booth bought land in 1997 in La Boquita, a beach area about 45
minutes southeast of Managua, for US$18,000. Construction of his
2,000 square-feet home with an ocean view cost $50,000. ``In Costa
Rica it would have set me back some $225,000. And in California, no
less than a million,'' he says.
 &HT;    According to International Living, an organization that hunts
good real estate deals worldwide for its members, a beachfront
property on Nicaragua's Pacific coast can go as high as $25,000.
Something comparable can cost three times more in Belize, four
times more in Honduras, and five times in Costa Rica. In the U.S.,
a similar piece of land could go for anywhere between 10 and 50
times more. Fleeing chaos and cold. Investors who have followed the
explosive growth of real estate speculation in Central America _
which began in Costa Rica in the 1970s _ saw it happen in Belize in
1985 and later in Honduras at the beginning of the 1990s. The
opportunities in Nicaragua, they say, are just beginning.
 &HT;    Although many of the foreign retirees are elderly, more and more
people between the ages of 40 and 50 arrive every day. These
newcomers are in good shape and are looking for adventure: They buy
properties near volcanoes and next to rivers, lakes and beaches,
where they can pursue their favorite sport or just enjoy the fresh
air. Many others are fleeing the chaos and cold weather of large
U.S. metropolises. An estimated 6,000 retirees in Nicaragua are
from the U.S. and Canada, compared with about 50,000 in Costa Rica,
some 15,000 in Panama and 5,000 in Belize.
 &HT;    ``These markets take years to mature, which is when the great
flow of money arrives, generally from retirees with means,'' says
Robert Fordi, who believes the best opportunities here are near the
Pacific Ocean and on Lake Nicaragua, one of the 10 largest in the
world. Real estate growth in Nicaragua ``started off slowly in
1997,'' he says. ``But the activity and interest has become more
intense over the past few months.''
 &HT;    Fordi looks for investment opportunities in real estate and
arranges trips through International Living. Groups of 15 people or
so travel with him to make contact with local real estate agents,
politicians, accountants and lawyers. He says real estate markets
see real growth when local governments enact policies to attract
foreign capital. In Nicaragua's case, real estate prices and the
number of transactions began to increase in 1997, after the
government approved laws and programs to entice foreign retirees. A
similar policy was highly successful in Costa Rica in the 1980s.
 &HT;    Nicaraguan law offers tax breaks and investment incentives.
Those who want to take advantage of the program must be older than
45 and have monthly incomes of at least $400, plus another $100
monthly for each additional person in their household. Retirees pay
no taxes on their foreign income and can bring as much as $10,000
worth of household goods, as well as a car, duty free.
 &HT;    ``The first investors and retirees started arriving,'' as soon
as the law went on the books, says Alvaro Saballos, partner in
Snider Realty, a Managua real estate agency founded in Costa Rica
during that country's real estate boom. The Nicaraguan-born
Saballos returned to his native country in 1995 when his
brother-in-law, Steve Snider, proposed starting a similar real
estate enterprise in Nicaragua. Snider had sold plenty of
properties to International Living investors, and began to sound
them out about Nicaragua in 1996.
 &HT;    ``Steve showed up with two clients who had already bought from
him and who had made money in Costa Rica. The government there had
done away with incentives for foreign retirees, while in Nicaragua
the program was just getting under way,'' Seballos says. ``When we
began, we averaged about one customer every two months, but later
it grew to one a week. Since February, the number has really picked
up. Most of our clients come from the U.S., but we have some
Canadians and Europeans as well.''
 &HT;    Nicaragua's efforts to attract foreign retirees were made
somewhat more difficult than other neighboring countries because of
its history of violence. ``My husband and I had a layover here in
1992 on our way to Costa Rica, and through the airplane's window we
saw the remnants of bullet-ridden helicopters. We said to ourselves
that we would never come to this place,'' says Diane Jackson, a
U.S. retiree. At the time, Jackson was searching for a place to
retire and had looked in Venezuela, the Dominican Republic and
Puerto Rico.
 &HT;    Her impression of Nicaragua changed when she returned in 1994 as
part of a business and academic mission between Pittsburgh and
Managua. ``The warmth of the people and the price of land really
attracted us, and we realized that things were not really as they
had seemed,'' she says. ``On the contrary, there was a lot of
opportunity because so much needed to be done.'' In the end,
Jackson and her husband were one of the first couples to take
advantage of the fiscal incentives. They moved here in 1996.
 &HT;    Jackson says that since her arrival she has seen growing numbers
of foreigners looking to buy property, not just as investments, but
as places to live. Purchasing land in Nicaragua can be an arduous
process, though. Diplomats here recommend that investors research
potential purchases carefully. Many have two titles the original
one and another issued during the Sandinista era.
 &HT;    Many times, buyers have to negotiate directly with the property
owner and pay in cash. Also, it is difficult to compare prices,
because the market is so new. Municipal governments have few
transaction records and scant information about the value of
properties.
 &HT;    ``One of the things that concerned me the most when I bought was
whether the title was valid or not,'' says Jackson. ``It's one of
the biggest risks, but fortunately I don't know anyone who has had
a bad experience.''
 &HT;    Most investors use lawyers recommended by their native countries
embassies or by agents like Snider Realty. ``Part of the work we do
is investigating whether the properties have questionable titles,''
says Seballos. ``On several occasions we have canceled a
transaction on the verge of closing because we found problems. For
us, the risk is not worth it. It's more important that things work
out properly than to be involved in a legal nightmare.''
 &HT;    Investors appear willing to run those risks to buy, though not
necessarily to build. Several local land owners say that most of
their property has been sold. ``My sales have shot up since
February,'' says Juan Sequeira, owner of the San Juan neighborhood
just outside Granada, Nicaragua's oldest colonial city, on Lake
Nicaragua. ``I've sold land to Canadians, Americans, Spaniards,
Austrians, though none yet show signs of starting construction. I
think they're waiting for market values to rise.''
 &HT;    Erwin Gonzalez, owner of the Pacific Marlin project, says he has
sold 75 percent of his plots to foreigners. He has sunk almost $1
million into infrastructure improvements and has sold half a
million dollars in land. The properties, on the side of a mountain
near San Juan del Sur bay, go for an average of $30,000 each.
 &HT;    ``These kinds of properties cost at least $125,000 in Costa
Rica. That's why we are seeing more Costa Rican clients, because
they recognize an opportunity when they see it,'' he says. ``They
lived through it.''

 &HT;    Gore looking to South for jump start

<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was not for family ties alone that Vice President
Al Gore came back to Carthage, Tenn., for the official start of his
presidential campaign Wednesday. Gore needs the South, and he has a
lot of ground to make up.
</P>
<P>
   The political algebra by which Gore might expect to win the next
election is different from 1992 and 1996, and even more heavily
weighted toward the West Coast and Northeast. But the vice
president can't continue to trail by the gaping margins measured
recently in polls in several Southern states and hope to win a
national race.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Gore pointed to Democratic victories last year
in Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina and Kentucky as evidence he can
compete in his home region _ even against an opponent who drops the
g's at the end of his words as easily as Texas Gov. George Bush.
``The new coalition in the South is interested in continuing our
economic prosperity, not going back to the failed approach that
almost wrecked our economy in the past,'' the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the same kind of approach that I took for 16
years as a candidate in Tennessee is resonant not only in the South
but all over the country. I think there's less regionalism today
than there was in times past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   African-American voters were an important component of the 1998
Democratic victories Gore spoke of, and for them, a major priority
is going to be the battle over who is counted _ and how _ in the
census that will determine how the political map is drawn for the
next decade. The vice president pledged he will be unwavering in
his support for statistical sampling, an issue over which the
Clinton administration and the Republican Congress are locked in
stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   Experts serving the past three administrations concluded that
the ``old approach of pretending that you can put your index finger
on the nose of every citizen and get an accurate count in a nation
of 250 million'' was outdated, Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now all of a sudden, the Republican majority in the
Congress, panicked that they are going to lose six seats and more,
have been trying to go to a system which they know very well will
result in an undercounting of blacks and Hispanics.''
</P>
<P>
   Important as minority votes are to his prospects in the region _
and if Bush is the Republican nominee, Hispanic support will be
much harder to lock down _ Gore's best hope, as he indicated, lies
in connecting with those issues that resonate across region and
race.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to sum up his environmental priorities, Gore framed a
pretty complicated answer in terms of Atlanta's sprawl problem and
praised Gov. Roy Barnes for pointing the way ``to how we can untie
the knots that many communities have felt they're tied into, and
give people more time with their children and cut down on traffic
jams.''
</P>
<P>
   As Gore pointed out, however, there were more than 200
anti-sprawl referendums across the country last year, and most of
them passed.
</P>
<P>
   Much the same could be said about a number of the issues the
vice president touched on in this session: school violence,
education standards, care for the elderly, extending the economic
boom times.
</P>
<P>
   These issues play about the same in Gwinnett County as they do
in San Diego. If he is to begin erasing the double-digit advantage
his potential Republican rivals currently enjoy in the polls, Gore
has to make significant inroads in both locations.

 &HT;    House rejects bill to keep violent, sexual material from youth
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House votes on new gun control laws today after
Democrats and conservative Republicans rejected legislation
Wednesday that would have jailed those who sold explicitly violent
or sexual material to juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation on violent and obscene material, sponsored by
Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) as an amendment to a
juvenile crime bill, was the centerpiece of Republican plans to fix
the ``culture of violence'' in America in the wake of shootings in
Littleton, Colo., and Conyers, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal failed 146 to 282, with 127 Republicans voting no.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were misled and disinclined to oppose the powerful
entertainment industry,'' said Hyde. ``I'm sorry to see that
happen. It was a serious attempt to address the cultural
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the House will begin debate on a dozen gun control
proposals, both for and against. The key votes will be on competing
legislation to regulate criminal background checks at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Minority leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) said up to 45 Democrats
will vote against a strict provision that would allow gun dealers
three days to conduct the checks and require all sellers, even
unlicensed ones, to perform background checks on buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said Democrats would need at least 51 Republicans to
pass the measure to be offered by Rep. Carolyn McCarthy (D-N.Y.),
whose husband was slain by a gunman in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're up against the best lobby in town,'' Gephardt said.
``This is a tough issue to win.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton sent a letter to 46 GOP lawmakers who
supported the Brady handgun control act of 1993, urging them to
support closing the so-called gun show loophole. Clinton and Vice
President Gore also called members, Gephardt said, but the outreach
to Republicans was too late for some.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), one of the original GOP
sponsors of the Brady bill, said he was on the phone with Attorney
General Janet Reno and other administration officials every day
during that debate. But not this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder if they are really interested in passing a bill,''
said Sensenbrenner, who said he remains undecided on which gun show
proposal to support. ``I'm not interested in helping them score
political points.''
</P>
<P>
   In a change in tactics, some strongly pro-gun lawmakers such as
Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) said Wednesday they were prepared to support
a much weaker provision targeting gun shows, sponsored by Rep. John
Dingell (D-Mich.), a former NRA board member, and backed by the
NRA.
</P>
<P>
   Barr said he and other conservatives were worried that if
Dingell's measure did not pass, the House would adopt more
restrictive measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much better than the alternatives,'' said Barr, an NRA
board member who has said he would back no new gun control
provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Majority whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas), whose ability to secure votes
is widely respected, was also trying to rally Republicans behind
Dingell's proposal so that stricter measures would not pass.
</P>
<P>
   After the intensity surrounding a similar debate in the Senate
four weeks ago, Wednesday's House debate was surprisingly low-key.
</P>
<P>
   Members on both sides of the aisle invoked the deaths at
Columbine High School and the shooting in Conyers, but generally
displayed little enthusiasm or passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to report that Conyers is doing just fine without
our help,'' said Linder, whose district includes Conyers. ``We need
to focus on other things than guns, and we need to enforce the gun
laws that are on the books and not continue to take advantage of
personal tragedy to promote a political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde predicted that his amendment dealing with the so-called
culture of violence would be a close vote, but it became clear that
members of his own party were against the idea; member after member
rose to oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my responsibility as a parent to make sure my children
are not watching inappropriate material,'' said Rep. James Rogan
(R-Calif.). ``It's not the responsibility of Congress or
Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr, another Judiciary Committee member, also spoke against
Hyde's amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the parents who have the ultimate control over what our
children see, hear and do,'' said Barr. ``No amount of legislation
we can pass will do that.''

 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MANAGUA, Nicaragua _ For Brad Booth, a former sales manager in
the United States, one factor outweighed all others in his decision
to retire in Nicaragua: price. It was not just the low cost of
living in general, as attractive here as it is in other parts of
the developing world, but the relatively cheap real estate. His eye
settled on one particular piece of property on the Pacific coast
that reminded him of San Clemente, California, where he lived for
the past 20 years.
 &HT;    ``I was really surprised, because I owned land in Roatan
(Honduras and in Belize.) But here you can buy land for much less
than in other Central American countries,'' says Booth, 58, as he
rests in a hammock on the terrace of his home. ``The real estate
market here reminds me of what it was like in Costa Rica 20 years
ago.''
 &HT;    Booth bought land in 1997 in La Boquita, a beach area about 45
minutes southeast of Managua, for US$18,000. Construction of his
2,000 square-feet home with an ocean view cost $50,000. ``In Costa
Rica it would have set me back some $225,000. And in California, no
less than a million,'' he says.
 &HT;    According to International Living, an organization that hunts
good real estate deals worldwide for its members, a beachfront
property on Nicaragua's Pacific coast can go as high as $25,000.
Something comparable can cost three times more in Belize, four
times more in Honduras, and five times in Costa Rica. In the U.S.,
a similar piece of land could go for anywhere between 10 and 50
times more. Fleeing chaos and cold. Investors who have followed the
explosive growth of real estate speculation in Central America _
which began in Costa Rica in the 1970s _ saw it happen in Belize in
1985 and later in Honduras at the beginning of the 1990s. The
opportunities in Nicaragua, they say, are just beginning.
 &HT;    Although many of the foreign retirees are elderly, more and more
people between the ages of 40 and 50 arrive every day. These
newcomers are in good shape and are looking for adventure: They buy
properties near volcanoes and next to rivers, lakes and beaches,
where they can pursue their favorite sport or just enjoy the fresh
air. Many others are fleeing the chaos and cold weather of large
U.S. metropolises. An estimated 6,000 retirees in Nicaragua are
from the U.S. and Canada, compared with about 50,000 in Costa Rica,
some 15,000 in Panama and 5,000 in Belize.
 &HT;    ``These markets take years to mature, which is when the great
flow of money arrives, generally from retirees with means,'' says
Robert Fordi, who believes the best opportunities here are near the
Pacific Ocean and on Lake Nicaragua, one of the 10 largest in the
world. Real estate growth in Nicaragua ``started off slowly in
1997,'' he says. ``But the activity and interest has become more
intense over the past few months.''
 &HT;    Fordi looks for investment opportunities in real estate and
arranges trips through International Living. Groups of 15 people or
so travel with him to make contact with local real estate agents,
politicians, accountants and lawyers. He says real estate markets
see real growth when local governments enact policies to attract
foreign capital. In Nicaragua's case, real estate prices and the
number of transactions began to increase in 1997, after the
government approved laws and programs to entice foreign retirees. A
similar policy was highly successful in Costa Rica in the 1980s.
 &HT;    Nicaraguan law offers tax breaks and investment incentives.
Those who want to take advantage of the program must be older than
45 and have monthly incomes of at least $400, plus another $100
monthly for each additional person in their household. Retirees pay
no taxes on their foreign income and can bring as much as $10,000
worth of household goods, as well as a car, duty free.
 &HT;    ``The first investors and retirees started arriving,'' as soon
as the law went on the books, says Alvaro Saballos, partner in
Snider Realty, a Managua real estate agency founded in Costa Rica
during that country's real estate boom. The Nicaraguan-born
Saballos returned to his native country in 1995 when his
brother-in-law, Steve Snider, proposed starting a similar real
estate enterprise in Nicaragua. Snider had sold plenty of
properties to International Living investors, and began to sound
them out about Nicaragua in 1996.
 &HT;    ``Steve showed up with two clients who had already bought from
him and who had made money in Costa Rica. The government there had
done away with incentives for foreign retirees, while in Nicaragua
the program was just getting under way,'' Seballos says. ``When we
began, we averaged about one customer every two months, but later
it grew to one a week. Since February, the number has really picked
up. Most of our clients come from the U.S., but we have some
Canadians and Europeans as well.''
 &HT;    Nicaragua's efforts to attract foreign retirees were made
somewhat more difficult than other neighboring countries because of
its history of violence. ``My husband and I had a layover here in
1992 on our way to Costa Rica, and through the airplane's window we
saw the remnants of bullet-ridden helicopters. We said to ourselves
that we would never come to this place,'' says Diane Jackson, a
U.S. retiree. At the time, Jackson was searching for a place to
retire and had looked in Venezuela, the Dominican Republic and
Puerto Rico.
 &HT;    Her impression of Nicaragua changed when she returned in 1994 as
part of a business and academic mission between Pittsburgh and
Managua. ``The warmth of the people and the price of land really
attracted us, and we realized that things were not really as they
had seemed,'' she says. ``On the contrary, there was a lot of
opportunity because so much needed to be done.'' In the end,
Jackson and her husband were one of the first couples to take
advantage of the fiscal incentives. They moved here in 1996.
 &HT;    Jackson says that since her arrival she has seen growing numbers
of foreigners looking to buy property, not just as investments, but
as places to livhasing land in Nicaragua can be an arduous
process, though. Diplomats here recommend that investors research
potential purchases carefully. Many have two titles the original
one and another issued during the Sandinista era.
 &HT;    Many times, buyers have to negotiate directly with the property
owner and pay in cash. Also, it is difficult to compare prices,
because the market is so new. Municipal governments have few
transaction records and scant information about the value of
properties.
 &HT;    ``One of the things that concerned me the most when I bought was
whether the title was valid or not,'' says Jackson. ``It's one of
the biggest risks, but fortunately I don't know anyone who has had
a bad experience.''
 &HT;    Most investors use lawyers recommended by their native countries
embassies or by agents like Snider Realty. ``Part of the work we do
is investigating whether the properties have questionable titles,''
says Seballos. ``On several occasions we have canceled a
transaction on the verge of closing because we found problems. For
us, the risk is not worth it. It's more important that things work
out properly than to be involved in a legal nightmare.''
 &HT;    Investors appear willing to run those risks to buy, though not
necessarily to build. Several local land owners say that most of
their property has been sold. ``My sales have shot up since
February,'' says Juan Sequeira, owner of the San Juan neighborhood
just outside Granada, Nicaragua's oldest colonial city, on Lake
Nicaragua. ``I've sold land to Canadians, Americans, Spaniards,
Austrians, though none yet show signs of starting construction. I
think they're waiting for market values to rise.''
 &HT;    Erwin Gonzalez, owner of the Pacific Marlin project, says he has
sold 75 percent of his plots to foreigners. He has sunk almost $1
million into infrastructure improvements and has sold half a
million dollars in land. The properties, on the side of a mountain
near San Juan del Sur bay, go for an average of $30,000 each.
 &HT;    ``These kinds of properties cost at least $125,000 in Costa
Rica. That's why we are seeing more Costa Rican clients, because
they recognize an opportunity when they see it,'' he says. ``They
lived through it.''

U.S. AND RUSSIA SIGN PACT FOR CURBING WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., Ga., S.C.)   (bl)  
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Setting aside policy differences over Kosovo, Iraq and other
contentious issues, the United States and Russia concluded an
agreement in Washington on Wednesday extending for seven years
programs to reduce the threat posed by nuclear, biological,
chemical and other weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   In a ceremony at the Russian Embassy on Wednesday morning,
Ambassador Yuri Ushakov signed the agreement and shook hands with
senior Defense Department officials to celebrate the extension of
the umbrella agreement that authorizes the Cooperative Threat
Reduction program.
</P>
<P>
   Started in 1991 by former Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and Sen. Richard
Lugar, R-Ind., the Cooperative Threat Reduction program has spent
$2.7 billion from 1992 to this year helping Russia, Kazakhstan,
Ukraine, Belarus, Uzbekistan and other former Soviet republics
reduce, control and eliminate unconventional weapons in their
military inventories. The bulk of these funds, about $1.7 billion,
has been spent on projects in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to spend at least that much, and perhaps a little
more, over the next seven years,'' said a senior Pentagon official.
</P>
<P>
   According to Pentagon data, the program has already helped
Russia deactivate 1,538 nuclear warheads; destroy 254
intercontinental ballistic missiles, 30 submarine-launched
ballistic missiles and 40 heavy bombers, and eliminate 50 silos for
long-range missiles and 148 launchers for submarine-launched
missiles _ all in keeping with Moscow's commitments under treaties
to reduce strategic nuclear and other unconventional weapons
systems.
</P>
<P>
   The program has also helped Russia finance the construction of
storage facilities for fissile material and chemical weapons and
the installation of equipment for safer storage of tactical and
strategic warheads scheduled for destruction. And the program
helped pay to eliminate weapons-grade plutonium by converting the
cores of Russia's remaining plutonium production reactors and to
dismantle and convert for peaceful use facilities that once made
material for chemical or biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials vigorously argue that the program is neither
charity nor foreign aid, but a cost-effective investment in U.S.
national security, a view supported by many independent defense
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The collapse of the Soviet Union left tens of thousands of
nuclear, chemical and biological munitions and agents unsecured,''
said Amy Smithson, a senior associate of the Henry L. Stimson
Center, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research institute based in
Washington. ``These funds have helped secure and dismantle a lot of
that arsenal,'' she said. Ms. Smithson called the program ``one of
the wisest investments of American taxpayer dollars in terms of
security that has ever come along.''
</P>
<P>
   While the program is very popular in the Senate, it usually
encounters greater skepticism in the House. Earlier this year, the
Senate approved the Defense Department's request for $475.5
million, some $35 million more than last year, for the 2000 fiscal
year, which begins in October.
</P>
<P>
   But the House, displeased with Pentagon plans to build an
expensive chemical weapons storage facility at Shchuchye, cut some
$35 million from the department's request and eliminated all
funding for the Shchuchye facility.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., the chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee, accused Russia of being increasingly reluctant
to pay its fair share of the burden for disarmament and better
security. ``Funding for these Cooperative Threat Reduction programs
seems to be becoming less `cooperative' and more one-sided,''
Spence complained recently.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Senate has expressed concern this year about Russia's
increasing inability to meet its financial contributions to the
program and the mounting cost to America. A Senate Armed Services
Committee report warned that the committee would not continue to
support full funding if Russia, now deeply in debt, pursues a
resolution passed by the lowe house of the Russian Parliament in
April calling for an increased defense budget, or a Russian plan
reported to develop new tactical nuclear forces.
</P>
<P>
   But several Senate Republicans said that overall support for the
program was ``stronger than ever'' and predicted that a
House-Senate conference on spending for the program would support
the administration's request for increased funds.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the General Accounting Office, Congress' independent
auditing agency, criticized Russia for its reluctance to share
``critical information'' with Washington, which the agency said may
have ``substantially increased'' the costs of certain projects to
the United States and caused delays in their completion. The report
also questioned whether Russia would use some of the U.S.-financed
facilities in a manner consistent with U.S. ``national security
objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   The umbrella agreement authorizing the program was set to expire
at midnight Wednesday. Sources on Capitol Hill and at the Defense
Department said that the administration, unsure about whether
Russia would approve the extension on time, quietly warned relevant
House and Senate committees more than a month ago that all spending
on joint threat reduction programs would have to be stopped
instantly if the umbrella agreement were not signed by the
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   One Defense Department official attributed the delay to Russian
bureaucratic resistance and distraction in Moscow due to the Kosovo
conflict and pressing economic crises, rather than to Russian
unhappiness with the programs or any desire to backtrack on its
disarmament commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when Moscow suspended participation in some joint
military programs and delayed several meetings earlier this year to
protest NATO's air strikes against Yugoslavia, joint projects
financed under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program were
conspicuously absent from the list. ``Not a single CTR program has
been jeopardized because of Kosovo,'' one Senate staff member said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing Moscow wants is a loose nuke or a stolen
chemical warhead,'' said one Pentagon official. ``Russia knows that
these programs enhance their security as well as ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Shurgalin, a spokesman for the Russian Embassy, called
the agreement ``very important,'' and said Moscow was pleased that
it had been signed on time.

 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MANAGUA _ Lo que motivo al estadounidense Brad Booth a retirarse
en Nicaragua fueron los precios. Y no solo el bajo costo de la vida
en general, sino el costo de los bienes raices, en particular de
una propiedad en la costa del Pacifico que le recuerda al paisaje
de un pueblo costero de California donde vivio 20 anos.
 &HT;    ``Quede realmente sorprendido porque yo tenia tierras en Roatan
[Honduras y tambien en Belice. Pero aqui se compran terrenos por
mucho menos que en otros paises de Centroamerica,'' dice Booth,
tumbado en una hamaca en la terraza de su casa. ``El mercado de
bienes raices me recuerda al de Costa Rica hace 20 anos.''
 &HT;    Booth, de 58 anos y gerente de ventas jubilado, compro su
propiedad en 1997 en La Boquita, una playa a 45 minutos de camino
al suroeste de Managua, por US$18.000. La construccion de la casa
de 185 metros cuadrados, que domina el oceano desde este
acantilado, le costo US$50.000. ``En Costa Rica me hubiera costado
unos US$225.000. Y en California no menos de un millon,'' calcula.
 &HT;    Segun International Living, una organizacion internacional que
se dedica a explorar el mercado de bienes raices a nivel mundial en
busca de buenas oportunidades para sus miembros, una propiedad
frente a la playa en la costa del Pacifico nicaraguense puede
costar hasta US$25.000. Algo comparable en Belice podria costar
tres veces mas; cuatro veces mas en Honduras y cinco veces mas en
Costa Rica.
 &HT;    Los inversionistas que han seguido de cerca este explosivo
aumento en la especulacion de la tierra en Centroamerica desde que
comenzo en Costa Rica en la decada de los anos 70coinciden en que
paso a Belice aproximadamente en 1985 y luego a Honduras a
principios de los anos 90. Y que las oportunidades en Nicaragua
apenas comienzan.
 &HT;    Aunque muchos de los pensionados extranjeros son personas
mayores, cada vez llegan mas de entre 40 y 50 anos, en plena forma
fisica y para quienes el factor de la aventura es cada vez mas
importante: compran propiedades junto a volcanes, lagos, rios y
playas, donde pueden practicar algun deporte o hacer la vida al
aire libre que las grandes ciudades les negaron. Muchos otros huyen
del caos y del frio de las grandes ciudades estadounidenses.
Diferentes fuentes calculan que en Nicaragua hay unos 6.000
retirados de Estados Unidos y Canada, mientras se calcula que hay
entre 30.000 y 50.000 pensionados extranjeros en Costa Rica, unos
15.000 en Panama y 5.000 en Belice.
 &HT;    ``Estos mercados nacen, crecen y demoran varios anos en madurar,
cuando llega el gran flujo de dinero, por lo general de retirados
con buenos medios economicos,'' explica Robert Fordi, quien calcula
que las principales oportunidades estan en propiedades frente al
Pacifico y en el Lago de Nicaragua. ''(El auge del mercado
inmobiliario en Nicaragua arranco despacio en 1997.) Pero la
actividad y el interes se han intensificado en los ultimos meses,''
agrega.
 &HT;    Fordi se dedica a explorar las buenas oportunidades de inversion
en bienes raices y forma grupos de unas 15 personas que viajan con
el para hacer contactos con agentes locales de bienes raices,
politicos, contadores y abogados. Fordi tambien organiza viajes a
traves de International Living.
 &HT;    Segun Fordi, la compraventa de inmuebles aumenta cuando los
gobiernos instituyen politicas de incentivos para el capital
extranjero. En el caso de Nicaragua, los precios y las
transacciones comenzaron a moverse en 1997 tras aprobarse en 1996
una ley sobre inversiones extranjeras y un programa para
pensionados similar al que tanto exito tuvo en Costa Rica en los
anos 80.
 &HT;    En el caso de Nicaragua, la ley ofrece exenciones tributarias e
incentivos a la inversion. Para beneficiarse del programa hay que
ser mayor de 45 anos, tener ingresos mensuales equivalentes por lo
menos a US$400, mas US$100 por cada persona adicional. Los
retirados no pagan impuestos sobre los ingresos que reciben del
extranjero y pueden importar un maximo de US$10,000 en bienes para
su vivienda.
 &HT;    Una vez aprobada la ley, ``fue entonces que comenzaron a venir
los primeros inversionistas y pensionados,'' dice Alvaro Saballos,
socio de Snider Realty Inc., una agencia de bienes raices de
Managua fundada en Costa Rica durante el boom inmobiliario.
Saballos, de origen nicaraguense, regreso a su pais a finales de
1995 cuando su cunado Steve Snider le propuso crear un negocio
similar en Nicaragua. Snider habia vendido en Costa Rica muchas
propiedades a inversionistas de International Living. En 1996
comenzo a interesarse por Nicaragua.
 &HT;    ``Steve vino con dos clientes que ya habian comprado con el y
que habian hecho dinero en Costa Rica, donde el gobierno habia
restringido los incentivos a los pensionados extranjeros, mientras
que en Nicaragua comenzaba la etapa de los incentivos,'' explica
Saballos.
 &HT;    En el caso de Nicaragua, comenzar a atraer pensionados
extranjeros fue un tanto mas dificil debido al historial de
violencia del pais. ``Mi esposo y yo hicimos una escala aqui en
1992 camino a Costa Rica, y por la ventanilla del avion vimos
hileras de helicopteros artillados, y nos dijimos que a este lugar
nunca vendriamos,'' dice Diane Jackson, una pensionada de EU que
viven en Nicaragua.
 &HT;    Cambio de opinion al regresar en 1994 como parte de una mision
academica y de comercio entre Pittsburgh y Managua. ``El calor de
la gente y el precio de la tierra nos atrajeron, y vimos que en
realidad las cosas no eran como nos las pintaban, y que por el
contrario, habia mucha oportunidad porque todo esta por hacerse.''
Jackson y su esposo fueron una de las primeras parejas en acogerse
a los beneficios de la ley nica y se mudaron en 1996.
 &HT;    Jackson afirma que ha visto un aumento constante en la cantidad
de extranjeros que llega al pais a comprar propiedades, no solo
como inversion sino tambien para vivir. Pero comprar una propiedad
en Nicaragua puede resultar una experiencia fuerte. Las misiones
diplomaticas advierten que es recomendable investigar
detalladamente el historial de las propiedades porque hay muchas
propiedades con dos titulos, los antiguos y los emitidos durante el
gobierno sandinista.
 &HT;    En muchas ocasiones hay que negociar directamente con el dueno y
se compra en efectivo, sin escalas comparativas de precios porque
el mercado acaba de nacer.
 &HT;    ``Una de las cosas que mas me asusto cuando compre aqui era si
el titulo de la propiedad era valido,'' comenta Jackson. ``Es uno
de los mayores riesgos, pero por fortuna no conozco a nadie que
haya sido perjudicado.''
 &HT;    La mayoria de los inversionistas buscan abogados recomendados
por las embajadas o agentes como Snider Realty. ``Parte del tramite
es ayudarlos a investigar si las tierras tienen problemas,'' dice
Saballos. ``En varias ocasiones hemos cancelado una transaccion
casi a punto de cerrar porque hemos encontrado irregularidades.
Para nosotros es mas importante que las cosas salgan bien que
meternos en una pesadilla juridica.''
 &HT;    Los inversionistas parecen estar mas que dispuestos a correr ese
riesgo, pero no han comenzado a construir. Varios duenos de
urbanizaciones afirmaron que la gran mayoria de sus lotes se han
vendido a extranjeros. ``Mis ventas se han disparado desde
febrero,'' dice Juan Sequeira, dueno del reparto San Juan, en las
afueras de Granada, la ciudad colonial mas antigua de Nicaragua,
junto al Lago de Nicaragua. ``He vendido [terrenos a canadienses,
estadounidenses, espanoles, austriacos, pero ninguno da muestras de
comenzar a construir. Creo que estan esperando a que aumente mas el
valor del mercado.''
 &HT;    Erwin Gonzalez, dueno del proyecto Pacific Marlin, dice que ha
vendido el 75 por ciento de sus lotes a extranjeros. Gonzalez ha
invertido casi US$1 millon en infraestructura y ha vendido medio
millon en terrenos. Situados en las laderas de una montana que
completa la herradura de la Bahia de San Juan del Sur, los lotes se
venden a un promedio de US$30.000.
 &HT;    ``Esta clase de propiedades en Costa Rica no cuestan menos de
US$125.000. Es por eso que entre nuestros clientes recientes
tenemos tambien ticos [costarricenses que saben que aqui esta la
oportunidad. Ellos ya lo vivieron,'' dice Gonzalez.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the exhibit hall of the Southern Baptist
Convention, Linda Muse, a missionary to Ecuador, greeted people
Wednesday and offered to share information about international
missions.
</P>
<P>
   Muse wore a bright blue skirt, embroidered blouse and colorful
woven belt, with eight strands of gold beads around her neck. The
outfit, she said, was traditional garb of the Otovalo Indians in
Ecuador, ``except for the tennis shoes,'' she said, looking down at
her neat white Keds. ``They're for comfort.''
</P>
<P>
   Muse said the number of strands of beads worn by Otovalo women
indicates their status. Hers, she said, would show that she is
``not too rich.'' Muse and her husband operate a telephone
counseling ministry on the coast of Ecuador that draws about 14,000
contacts a month.
</P>
<P>
   Double headers: Toys or stress relief?
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Kenneth Tan of the North American Mission Board handed
out foam baseballs. For the kids, he said, they were toys. He
encouraged adults to squeeze them for stress relief. ``We want
people to step up to the plate and be involved,'' Tan said.
Meanwhile, children lined up 20 deep waiting for a turn at an
electronic batting cage. Augustine Hui, 8, of New York had been
through the line seven times. ``I only got a home run once,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bookstore proves popular diversion
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular parts of the Southern Baptist Convention
was its 12,000-square-foot bookstore set up on the floor of the
Georgia Dome with $750,000 in inventory and 18 cashier lines. Among
the most popular items were books by convention speakers, T-shirts
and boxed cards, said David Pigg, store manager.
</P>
<P>
   `Curse Free TV' sanitizes boob tube
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen people stood around a television as Jonas
Robertson demonstrated ``Curse Free TV.'' A box on the top reads
closed captions and substitutes innocent words for 100 words deemed
inappropriate. Other devises, Robertson said, replace naughty words
with words of similar connotation. ``If someone says, `I'm going to
kick you in the rear,' word association tells you what the word
really was,'' he said. His device substitutes ``toe'' for the word
meaning posterior. ``For one really awful expletive, we use the
word `clown,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Call us Southern, conventioneers say
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Southern Baptists rejected a proposal to take
a straw poll on whether to change the name of their group to the
International Baptist Convention. They also turned down an
amendment to poll on the proposed name Scriptural Baptist
Convention, to maintain the SBC initials. Joked one observer, ``The
Southern Baptists just voted not to be scriptural.

COMMENTARY: `CULTURE OF ARROGANCE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Computers at our nuclear laboratories are again
being ordered to ``stand down.'' Our most secret work on our most
powerful weaponry is coming to a screeching two-day halt.
</P>
<P>
   That's because of a line in a report issued this week by
``Piffiab,'' the president's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board:
``A nefarious employee can still download secret weapons
information to a tape, put it in his or her pocket, and walk out
the door.''
</P>
<P>
   This despite Energy Secretary Bill Richardson's previous public
assurances that the barn door had been locked, now that China has
our warhead secrets.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress' Cox committee on Chinagate submitted its
classified findings six months ago, President Clinton assigned
Piffiab's chairman, former Sen. Warren Rudman, a Republican, to do
the usual White House whitewash.
</P>
<P>
   However, to my surprise, Rudman delivered the most damning
excoriation any White House has ever directed at its own
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saturated with cynicism, an arrogant disregard for authority,
and a staggering pattern of denial ... organizational disarray,
managerial neglect . .. pervasive inefficiency ... an abominable
record of security with deeply troubling threats to American
national security.'' Strong letter follows.
</P>
<P>
   The White House damage-control idea was to put out a soothing
report that everybody-did-it, it's-not-so-terrible and
now-it's-all-fixed. And one Rudman paragraph pooh-poohs all
``diabolical conspiracies.''
</P>
<P>
   But then the runaway White House panel ripped into the
Department of Justice and F.B.I. for failing to investigate
security lapses. It finds that a ``comprehensive'' July 1997
briefing of the national security adviser, Samuel Berger, ``was
sufficient to warrant aggressive White House action'' _ but notes
that then a year went by of ``bureaucratic foot-dragging.''
</P>
<P>
   And it lacerates the Department of Energy. ``I think Bill
Richardson, who is a fine man,'' Rudman tells me, ``has been
seduced by his own bureaucracy. He says he'll recommend the
president veto our proposed reorganization. But does anybody think
Bill Clinton cares if Congress reorganizes the Department of
Energy?''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson derogates the solution Piffiab proposes, which is to
spin off the nuclear labs from the maze of disorganization and
``cultural arrogance . . . incapable of reforming itself'' at DOE.
Instead he has just appointed another general to be another czar, a
time-worn public relations palliative.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Richardson. He is Clinton's designated punching bag, held
out front to absorb the punishment properly belonging to Sandy
Berger, who didn't want to upset his ``strategic partnership'' with
China, and Janet Reno, who didn't want to investigate espionage at
Los Alamos or Chinese influence-buying at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to change things without adding a new fiefdom,''
Richardson says. Though said to be third on Al Gore's short list of
running mates (after Dianne Feinstein and Bill Bradley), the
sad-eyed secretary is unaware that the lame-duck White House is
setting him up to be the hapless defender of the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   The weakness of the unprecedented Piffiab blast is that it is
long on harsh judgment but short on fresh information. Unlike the
Cox report, it does not advance the story.
</P>
<P>
   An exception is a couple of tantalizing lines about security
violations at national labs that were inexplicably ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Two listening devices _ bugs _ were discovered planted in one of
our nuclear research facilities. Although the date of this
penetration is classified for no good reason, I believe it to be
before 1992. Was this investigated, and if not, why not?
Richardson's top counterspy doesn't know; it's up to Congress to
find out.
</P>
<P>
   More recently than 1995, an illegal telephone wiretap was found
installed in a national lab. ``The employee who installed it
confessed,'' reads the cryptic line, ``but was not prosecuted by
the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Was some guy spying on his girlfriend? Was it a Los Alamos
scientist playing a prank behind top-secret doors? Who took the
confession?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea,'' says Piffiab's Rudman. ``But the fact is
there was no reaction. When listening devices or wiretaps are found
in such a secure place, the hounds of law enforcement should be
unleashed the moment they are discovered. But the FBI was never
told.''

A KOSOVAN FAMILY RETURNS HOME ... TO NOTHING 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-REFUGEES)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOPI, Yugoslavia _ There were once three houses in Fatmir
Kryeziu's little compound here, one just for guests. There was a
television set his 28-year-old son, Shaban, had bought for the
family by working on construction jobs in Germany, along with a big
music system, a refrigerator and a freezer to store food for the
long winter.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on cinders Wednesday afternoon, Kryeziu looked around
and sighed deeply.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The original house was just a jagged jumble of old crude bricks.
The newer one, the one that he built with the family's earnings and
savings seven years ago, was completely burned out, its concrete
walls scorched black. The rooms were empty, the only things left
were some blackened wires and an old stove not worth taking.
</P>
<P>
   With 13 other members of his family, he had been living as a
refugee across the border in Kukes, Albania, for the last two and a
half months, renting a single room from an Albanian family for 150
German marks a month.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, along with thousands of other Kosovo
Albanians hounded out of their homes in the Serbian purge, he
ventured back across the Morini crossing point, now controlled by
German soldiers helped by the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, to this
village of about 300 houses a few miles southeast of Suva Reka.
</P>
<P>
   Like all the refugees, he remembered the moment the Serbs
ordered him out, on Friday March 26, two days after the NATO
bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could hear the shooting in the village,'' he said. ``The
police came and said to the people `you have two minutes to leave
your houses.' We grabbed our car and tractor and fled. We did not
take anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians in Kukes had been kind and tried to help, he said,
``But they were so poor, we were like Americans to them.''
</P>
<P>
   He looked now around the family compound. His dog was shot dead,
the place where the family stored the feed corn smashed, along with
the garage. Scraps of clothing, including his daughter-in-law's
wedding party dress, were strewn in the doorway along with a baby
bottle. The floor of every empty room crunched with cinders and
charcoal. There had been two cows, but he couldn't find them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't describe how I'm feeling,'' he said. ``I'm not really
happy, but one thing that makes me happy is that my family is okay.
I know it will be really hard to rebuild this place.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody takes only a chicken from you and kills it, you
feel very sad, so you can imagine how I feel when I see my house
burned.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the refugees had been told there might be mines or booby
traps in the villages, some men, including Kryeziu, came ahead to
investigate. Now, he said he would go back and get his children,
measuring the yard with his eye to see where he might put up a
tent.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally in this formerly Communist part of the world,
people have put all the wealth they gained _ often from working
abroad _ into building and constantly rebuilding their houses and
filling them with consumer goods. Burning and looting a house wipes
out everything a family has accumulated over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did they have to burn all of them,'' he said, looking at
the charred buildings sadly. ``Why didn't they leave one of them so
that when we came back we could have a shelter?''

STAR IN MEXICO SOUGHT FOR QUESTIONING IN SEX CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ANDREW DOWNIE 
and JAMES PINKERTON 
 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Prancing provocatively around the stage in her
combat boots, ripped tights and colorful tops, Gloria Trevi was
known as Mexico's Madonna _ young, beautiful, spontaneous and
uncompromising.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s she was a huge success. Her records sold
millions, her films were box-office hits here, and her risque
calendars became collectors items.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, she was regarded by some artists and writers here
almost as a poster girl for Mexico's popular culture. Essayist
Carlos Monsivais described her as ``the serpent in the Garden of
Eden dressed in a thong.'' Historian Elena Poniatowska called her
``a living work of art.`` Trevi's lover was her manager, Sergio
Andrade.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 10 years since her daring stage presence took this
staunchly conservative nation by storm, she has vanished and is
wanted by police for questioning on allegations about the kidnap
and sexual abuse of a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Texas' Rio Grande Valley said Wednesday that Trevi _
whose real name is Gloria de los Angeles Trevino _ has been seen in
recent months at The Club at Cimmeron, an exclusive golf resort
near Mission, Texas, where many Mexican families have bought second
homes.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal broke in March when the parents of the teen, Karina
Yapor of Chihuahua state, accused Trevi and Andrade of corrupting
the teen-ager after Andrade took her under his wing.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of Andrade's skill as a star-maker in Mexico, Yapor's
parents had given their consent for their daughter to join his
talent-development program. But they became concerned when she
stopped calling home. Then, they received a telephone call from
Spain telling them that their daughter had abandoned an infant son
in a Madrid orphanage.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican authorities suspect that Andrade may have fathered the
baby and want to question him about that and allegations that he
and Trevi had lured other young women into sex with the manager.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors about the couple's exploits had run through the industry
for some time, but they were not taken seriously until Andrade's
first wife wrote a book about her five years with him and Trevi.
</P>
<P>
   Aline Hernandez, 23, whom Andrade invited to join his stable of
singers when she was just 13, accused Andrade of trying to
brainwash her, starving her and forcing her to have sex before they
were married when she was 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a psycopath who gets hold of girls as young as 12 and
dominates them,'' she said in an interview. ``He does whatever he
wants with girls. He has a harem.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez published her book last year and asked the police to
investigate Andrade's conduct. Trevi denied the accusations. There
was no comment from Andrade, and little action was taken here until
the Spanish authorities became involved earlier this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Mexico have been scouring the country, seeking not
only Trevi and Andrade but also other young women whom they fear
may have been abused by the couple.
</P>
<P>
   Mission police said Wednesday they were contacted Monday by a
correspondent for the El Manana newspaper in Reynosa, Mexico, who
told them a young woman had come to their McAllen, Texas, office
and claimed she had been raped by Andrade in California nine years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Raul Gonzalez said he contacted the woman, now 25, who
told him she was sexually assaulted in a hotel in Glendale, Calif.,
when she was 15 or 16 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was supposed to go and record a song, and when she was in
a hotel the suspect (Andrade) came into the room and raped her,''
the detective said, adding she wanted to file charges against
Andrade and Trevi.
</P>
<P>
   ``She claims that she (Trevi) was the one who lured her into the
business ... and that's why she is also responsible for what
happened to her,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   He said his department's brief investigation into the alleged
assault was closed after learning the six-year statute of
limitations on the crime in California has expired.
</P>
<P>
   Searches at homes owned by the couple in at least three Mexican
states provided no clues about the pair's whereabouts, and with no
other leads, Mexican police launched a media campaign aimed at
tracking them down.
</P>
<P>
   They put up ``wanted'' posters across Mexico, opened telephone
hot lines in Chihuahua and Mexico City and alerted Interpol, the
international police agency, and foreign embassies to the
possibility that the couple may have secured false passports and
fled to Europe or South America.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities, however, stress there are still no formal charges
against the couple and that they only want to talk to them.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal appears to mark the end of the career of a star who
brought a breath of fresh air to Mexico's predictable world of
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   She chose to don a Madonna-like costume of torn fishnet tights
and do outrageous stunts on stage. She was assertive, and she once
defiantly told an audience, ``They want me to see a psychiatrist,
but I am not mad. I am just exasperated!''
</P>
<P>
   Such scenes did not please Mexico's conservative Roman Catholic
church leaders, who labeled her a threat to the country's
traditional values.
</P>
<P>
   She was, however, a huge hit with ordinary Mexicans. Many school
girls identified with her, teen-age boys idolized her and their
elders lined up to buy her calendars that showed her in various
stages of undress.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Mexico's intellectual community remain
infatuated with Trevi. They met last week for what the cultural
correspondent at the La Jornada newspaper called ``an attempt to
unravel the social, judicial and psychological implications of the
Trevi case.''
</P>
<P>
   They, along with just about everyone else in Mexico, are now
speculating about Trevi's sex life, her disappearance and the
veracity of the allegations against her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things they are saying now are very worrying to us,'' said
Jose Luis Cuevas, the painter who organized and hosted the
discussion. ``I don't know what has become of her. I admired her
and when people started to say she was like Madonna I said she is
better than that. I stick to that view. She is a splendid dancer, a
great actress and extraordinarily beautiful. I defend this woman of
the entertainment world.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, too, is standing by her former best friend. It's
Andrade whom she wants to see behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gloria is the world's best manipulator, but she is also a
victim in all this,'' Hernandez said. ``Deep down I know she is not
a bad person. He is a head case and must be stopped.''

 &HT;    Freed man `bombarded' by journalists, job offers
 &HT;    By Gabriella Boston and Bill Montgomery
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On his first day out of prison after serving 16 years
for a rape he didn't commit, Calvin Johnson rode down Peachtree
Street in a limousine, appeared repeatedly on television and
collected job offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to know what I've done in the last 24 hours?
Interviews, interviews, interviews. One reporter leaves, another
pulls up,'' Johnson said Wednesday. ``I've been bombarded.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he received five to 10 job offers Wednesday, but
had had little chance to return the calls. He did not disclose the
names of any companies or positions he'd been offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'll start (working) next week. But if I don't, it's
OK,'' said Johnson. ``But I have to start the week after next. I
have to get a job.''
</P>
<P>
   The 41-year-old was convicted in Clayton County in 1983 of rape,
aggravated sodomy and burglary. Johnson was freed Tuesday after DNA
tests conducted at the request of the New York-based Innocence
Project proved he could not have been the attacker.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Johnson's lawyer during the trial recalled a
courtroom divided racially. ``Everyone at the prosecution table was
white, the victim was white, the witnesses against him were
white,'' lawyer Akil K. Secret said. ``It was the opposite for
Calvin. He was black, I was black and his alibi witnesses were
black.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Wednesday he believed an impartial jury would have
acquitted him. ``Things influence people,'' he said. ``When you
have a white jury, a white prosecutor and a black man accused, it's
hard for them to picture me as anything other than guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clayton County District Attorney Bob Keller denied that race
played a part in Johnson's conviction. ``There is nothing I would
do differently,'' Keller said. ``The case was well-tried. He had a
good attorney, and no one made any accusations that there was
prosecutorial misconduct or racial appeals or witness tampering.''
</P>
<P>
   A stroke of luck protected the evidence that allowed Johnson to
be freed. Prosecutors say the cotton swabs used for the DNA tests
were headed for the trash at one point, but were salvaged at the
last minute and kept in the DA's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did we save that evidence?'' Keller asked. ``Certainly
because it was evidence from a serious case. That played a part,
but I don't doubt for a minute that the Lord had a hand in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's younger sister, Tara Burkett, said her brother is
overwhelmed by all the attention and by life outside the prison
walls. Early Wednesday, Burkett said, Johnson was walking down the
hall, but suddenly stopped in his tracks and said, ``Now, what was
I supposed to do?'' Burkett had had to remind him it was time to
brush his teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having to point him in a lot of different directions,''
Burkett said. ``He's had such a structured life for 16 years, he
doesn't know where to turn. He's a little lost.

 &HT;    Alabama: Tied to hitching post
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The long, heavy shackles of Alabama's chain gangs are
gone. But prison hitching posts _ which trace their history to
Colonial pillories _ may be back.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by Gov. Don Siegelman, Alabama prison Commissioner Mike
Haley argued in federal court this week to reinstate the practice
of shackling ``disruptive'' inmates to outdoor hitching posts. That
would make Alabama, again, the only state to use them.
</P>
<P>
   The horizontal metal bars _ one secured 50 inches above the
ground, another at 45 inches to accommodate inmates of different
heights _ resemble tall bike racks. Prisoners who fight or refuse
hard labor assignments are handcuffed to the posts to change their
behavior, officials testified.
</P>
<P>
   Today in a conference call with U.S. District Judge Myron
Thompson, attorneys with the Southern Poverty Law Center in
Birmingham, Ala., representing two inmates who brought a class
action lawsuit, and the Alabama corrections agency will review
legal arguments. While Thompson contemplates his decision, the
state's hitching posts will remain unused.
</P>
<P>
   Portraying himself last fall as a progressive Democrat,
Siegelman ousted Republican incumbent Fob James, an evangelical
Christian accused of miring Alabama in backwoods stereotypes by
encouraging defiance of court rulings against school prayer and
advocating harsher prisons. James rejuvenated widespread use of the
hitching post in 1995. An August ruling by Thompson suspended their
use.
</P>
<P>
   Siegelman has tried elevating the state's image. He recently
helped secure a multimillion-dollar Honda plant outside Birmingham
and returns to the state today after a European recruiting trip.
</P>
<P>
   But prisoners suffering in 95-degree heat until they decide to
work isn't a bothersome image to state officials. In June 1995, one
inmate was hitched for seven hours without water after a fight with
six corrections officers. When he asked for a drink, guards who
gave ice water to prison dogs tipped over a cooler in front of the
man, according to testimony in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Siegelman and I agree inmates should have to work
just like taxpayers work, and he and I agree the restraining bar is
an effective management tool,'' Haley said at a court hearing
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hitched inmates typically eat lunch while shackled and standing.
</P>
<P>
   At Limestone Correctional Facility in Capshaw, officials once
let prisoners eat with one hand unshackled, but the experiment
ended because it took too much time and too many extra officers to
secure the area.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1994, the U.S. Department of Justice
investigated hitching post use at Alabama's Easterling Correctional
Facility. Federal officials concluded the posts were an improper
use of restraints and were ``potentially dangerous from a medical
standpoint.'' Despite a federal recommendation that the hitching
post be abandoned, the practice continued and state officials wrote
back that ``the security bar is not used with malice or cruelty but
with the intent of maintaining prison security.''
</P>
<P>
   Decades of abusive practices led a federal judge in 1979 to
order Alabama to fix its prison system, said historian Dixie
Dysart, who has researched conditions in the state's women's
prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alabama has a pretty checkered history in treating its
inmates,'' Dysart said.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama prisons decades ago put unruly inmates in something
called the ``sweatbox'' or the ``doghouse'' _ what Dysart describes
as ``very small boxes that looked like coffins.'' In an earlier
hearing, a prison expert for the plaintiffs testified that the
hitching post traced its lineage to pillories and stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything,'' the expert testified, ``the pillory, as it was
designed, was probably more comfortable because in most cases the
prisoner sat on the ground and had his feet and his hands put
through a stock. In this case, we're perhaps more barbarous because
what we're doing is stretching an inmate out in the hot sun so he's
uncomfortable and can't move.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, two inmates sued the state prison commissioner.
Prisoners testified they defecated on themselves after hours of
standing locked to the posts without restroom breaks. In August,
Thompson ruled the devices unconstitutionally cruel. Their use
ceased. If the state wanted them back, officials would need a
version that would pass constitutional muster.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, guards have locked prisoners who refused hard labor
inside pens paved with asphalt. ``They lie down on the ground and
go to sleep, which really defeats the purpose,'' Haley said.
</P>
<P>
   Haley consulted with wardens and the governor before proposing a
new policy. The major change recommends using video cameras to
monitor when water and restroom breaks are needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, it's the same policy as the old policy,'' said
plaintiffs' attorney Rhonda Brownstein. ``There is unnecessary pain
and punishment.

 &HT;    Murdoch: Cable to lead TV, Internet content distribution
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Rupert Murdoch has pronounced cable TV the
unquestioned winner of the contest for which industry will dominate
the distribution of television and Internet content.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that the future is cable,'' said Murdoch,
chairman of News Corp., which owns the Fox TV and movie
enterprises. ``There's perhaps a small corner for satellite
broadcasters, but the challenge from the telephone companies is
doubtful.''
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch made his industry assessment as the closing act for the
National Cable Television Association convention, which ran here
Sunday through Wednesday. He was interviewed by Fox News
correspondent Brit Hume in front of several hundred cable
executives.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch has a vested interest in seeing cable do well. He owns
several cable TV channels, including Fox News, Fox Sports and Fox
Family. But he also owns Fox Television, considered the fourth
biggest TV network. That makes Murdoch a competitor, too, and he
said some things cable executives didn't necessarily want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   For one, he said the big broadcasters such as Fox would remain
the 800-pound gorillas of the media business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be room for broadcasters,'' said Murdoch.
``The networks' economics are under challenge, but advertisers will
continue to look at the broadcasters as the best way to reach a
mass audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch also challenged the conventional wisdom about the
Internet, saying that most Web sites don't have much of a
commercial future.
</P>
<P>
   In closing, Murdoch agreed with a questioner who said that there
were too few minority-owned cable channel and TV stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too little progress has been made in minority ownership,''
said Murdoch.
</P>
<P>
   He said his company was taking the lead in raising minority
ownership, relating a controversial proposal Fox has made to the
Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch has proposed letting big companies like his own lend
money to minority businessmen to buy channels and stations. In
return, he has asked the FCC to ease the cap on how many TV
stations a company can own.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, a company is not permitted to own stations
controlling more than 35 percent of the U.S. TV market.

SENATE PASSES BILL TO LET DISABLED PEOPLE WHO WORK KEEP MEDICAL

 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By a vote of 99-0, the Senate on Wednesday passed a
bill that would expand Medicaid and Medicare so hundreds of
thousands of people with disabilities could retain their health
benefits when they return to work.
</P>
<P>
   The House is well on its way to passing similar legislation.
President Clinton hailed Wednesday's vote and prodded Congress to
finish work on the bill as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would be the most significant health care legislation
approved by Congress this year, and the most important measure for
disabled people in nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-nine senators and 179 representatives have signed up as
co-sponsors of the legislation, which has support from liberals and
conservatives alike, who see it as a way to increase work
opportunities for disabled people who would otherwise subsist on
welfare.
</P>
<P>
   About 8 million disabled people of working age receive more than
$70 billion a year in federal cash benefits. Fewer than 0.5 percent
of them return to work, despite a 1990 law that prohibits job
discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, many people with disabilities must choose
between working and keeping their health insurance. If they take
jobs and earn any significant amounts of money, they lose their
disability benefits and the health insurance they receive through
Medicaid and Medicare. But without the health care, they are, in
most cases, unable to work.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., a co-author of the bill who
induced many Republicans to support the measure, said: ``It offers
a new and better life to large numbers of our fellow citizens. We
must banish the patronizing mind-set that disabled people are
unable. In fact, they have enormous talent, and America cannot
afford to waste an ounce of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the people who expect to benefit from the bill is Donna P.
McNamee, 40, of Willoughby, Ohio. ``I'm thrilled,'' she said in a
telephone interview after the vote. ``This is long overdue. I've
been disabled since birth by brittle bone disease. I'm a graduate
of Ursuline College in Ohio, and I have a degree in business
administration, but I've never been able to use my education to
full potential. If I went to work and earned more than $499 a
month, I would lose my health insurance under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm grossly underemployed. All I can do is some writing,
editing and research. I would like to expand on that and start a
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas E. Lowery, an employment specialist in the Illinois
Department of Human Services, said, ``For millions of people with
disabilities, the biggest obstacle to re-entering the job market is
the risk of losing health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   The House Commerce Committee approved a nearly identical version
of the bill on May 19. Rep. Rick Lazio, Republican of New York, was
the chief sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Two Senate committee chairmen, James M. Jeffords of Vermont and
William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, both Republicans, and Bob Dole,
the party's presidential nominee in 1996, championed the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Finance Committee approved the bill in early March,
but Republican leaders delayed floor action for several reasons.
They wanted to know how the cost, $800 million over five years,
would be met, and they still do not have a clear answer. Some
conservatives expressed concern that the bill would cover people
with the virus that causes AIDS. And Republican leaders said they
did not want to let Kennedy dictate their agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, the Work Incentives Improvement Act, would create
several new options:
</P>
<P>
   _ People who lose eligibility for Social Security disability
benefits because they return to work would be allowed to continue
their Medicare coverage.
</P>
<P>
   _ People with disabilities could buy Medicaid coverage even if
they took jobs and earned income that would otherwise disqualify
them. States could charge premiums for such coverage, rising with a
person's income.
</P>
<P>
   _ States could allow disabled workers to buy Medicaid coverage
even if the workers lost eligibility for cash benefits because of
improvements in their medical conditions.
</P>
<P>
   _ States could provide Medicaid to workers who are not actually
disabled, but have physical or mental impairments that are
``reasonably expected'' to become severe disabilities in the
absence of health care. This provision could help people who have
been infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, but have not
developed symptoms of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge victory for people with HIV,'' said Daniel
Zingale, executive director of AIDS Action, an advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   The same section of the bill could also help people with
Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and other long-term chronic
or degenerative conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, blocked consideration of the bill last
month because, he said, it would have been financed by tax
increases, including a change in the foreign tax credit for some
multinational corporations. Wednesday Gramm said he had ``always
supported the policy change that will allow disabled people to
continue drawing benefits when they find jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   At his insistence, Democrats agreed that the cost of the bill
would be offset by cuts in spending elsewhere in the federal
budget, not by any tax increase. The spending cuts will be
identified later.

 &HT;    Minorities making gains on corporate boards
 &HT;    By Shannon Shelton
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ethnic minorities continue to increase their presence
on the boards of America's top corporations, according to a
Korn/Ferry International study.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty percent of the nation's 903 largest corporations have at
least one ethnic minority director, up from 55 percent in 1998.
African-Americans are on 39 percent of all boards, Latinos on 12
percent and Asians on 9 percent, Korn/Ferry said.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of boards with women increased slightly, to 73
percent this year from 72 percent in 1998.

 &HT;    Region's best entrepreneurs to be honored
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You've got a can't-miss breakfast meeting with a
client across town to seal a business deal. But your refrigerator
is on the blink, and the repair guy says he'll be there between 9
a.m. and 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you met anyone who hasn't had to be in two places at one
time?'' quips Andrea Arena, owner of 2 Places at One Time, a
corporate concierge service.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta businesswoman is among two dozen entrepreneurs from
Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee competing as finalists in this
year's Ernst &AMP; Young's Entrepreneur of the Year contest. Winners
will be announced tonight at a ceremony at the Grand Hyatt Atlanta
in Buckhead. Seventeen of the 24 finalists are from Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Arena, 32, has made a business out of providing concierge
services to companies that want to help employees balance work and
personal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, it's like an errand service,'' said Arena, who
started the business about 18 months after she graduated from
Georgia Tech in 1991. You name it, Arena's company has done it: pet
sitting, grocery shopping, waiting for the plumber, delivering
medical products, even planning a few weddings.
</P>
<P>
   The $5 million-a-year business has 70 offices in the United
States and Canada. Clients include companies such as 3Com Corp. and
Motorola. Arena said she got the idea after working as a concierge
at the Hyatt Regency in downtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in the Beaver Cleaver environment anymore,'' Arena
said. ``Many (people) don't have a secretary or wife at home who's
going to meet these needs.''
</P>
<P>
   There were some incredible businesses among the entries, said
Elizabeth Camp, a contest judge. Camp, president of Camp Oil Co.,
based in Rome, was one of 10 judges who helped narrow the list of
more than 100 entries to the finalists.
</P>
<P>
   Finalist Jack Alexander, 48, said innovative use of the Internet
and ``an entrepreneurial corporate culture'' helped build his
Buckhead-based corporate travel management firm, WorldTravel
Partners, into a $3.2 billion enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very different structure from our competitors, which
tend to be more centrally owned and controlled,'' said Alexander, a
former certified public accountant for Arthur Andersen who bought
the company in 1987. It is now one of the nation's largest travel
management firms.

RUGGED BUMPERS ARE NOT, STUDY FOR AUTO INSURERS SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (pr) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Sport utility vehicles may look big and sturdy, but
their bumpers actually tend to be weak, allowing more damage to
occur in low-speed collisions than bumpers on cars, an insurance
industry group said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which is financed by
the nation's auto insurers, conducted crash tests at 5 mph on six
popular midsize sport utility vehicles. It found that the cost of
fixing them was two to three times as much as for a typical small
or midsize car, with the sport utility vehicles sustaining up to
$2,000 in damage for each test, including crushed fenders, bent
hoods, broken tailgates and shattered lights.
</P>
<P>
   The damage is so costly partly because replacement parts for
sport utility vehicles tend to be fairly expensive, the institute
said. But the leading reason cited for the heavy damage was that
the bumpers themselves were not very strong, consisting of
unusually thin sheet metal with little, if any, energy-absorbing
plastic foam behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very different from the rugged image utility vehicle
manufacturers are selling,'' said Adrian Lund, the research
director at the institute, which is based in Arlington, Va.
``Instead of rugged, a more appropriate description for the bumpers
on these vehicles is flimsy.''
</P>
<P>
   The vehicles tested were the Mitsubishi Montero Sport, Dodge
Durango, Land Rover Discovery, Jeep Grand Cherokee, Lexus RX-300
and Mercedes ML-320.
</P>
<P>
   Still, classified as light trucks along pickup trucks and
minivans, sport utility vehicles are exempt from a wide range of
safety and environmental regulations, including Federal bumper
standards that require cars to withstand impacts at 2.5 mph with
little, if any, damage. Lund said that regulators should raise the
standards to 5 mph and apply them equally to cars, sport utility
vehicles, pickup trucks and minivans.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers strongly oppose extending the car bumper standards to
other vehicles but say they are making improvements anyway.
``Customer expectations will drive changes in vehicles if that's
what customers want,'' so regulations are unnecessary, said Gloria
Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile
Manufacturers in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Hurd, a spokesman for the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, said the agency was not reviewing its bumper
standards. Bumpers are mainly a consumer issue involving the cost
of repair rather than a safety issue for a vehicle's occupants, he
said, adding that the agency has higher safety priorities.
</P>
<P>
   In a high-speed impact, even a car's relatively sturdy bumper
crumples so quickly that it provides little protection for the
car's occupants, and their survival depends on the overall
construction of the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   But Lund said that the height of sport utility vehicles' bumpers
could have a big effect on the safety of other motorists and damage
to their vehicles. Federal standards require cars to have bumpers
that are 16 to 20 inches off the ground. Yet because sport
utilities are exempt from the standards, they commonly have higher
bumpers that ride over cars' bumpers and doorsills in collisions,
causing more damage and injuries, he said.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors Corp. is trying to address this problem. The new
Chevrolet Suburban, which will go on sale this fall, will have a
front bumper extending 4.4 inches lower than on the current model,
putting the lower half of the bumper at the level of a car bumper.
The rear bumper will be 2.5 inches lower, and the stiff steel rails
in the Suburban's underbody, which do most of the damage in the
event of a high-speed crash, will be 1.5 inches lower.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Hazelbaker, a spokesman for the Highway Loss Data Institute,
another insurance industry group, said that insurance rates
depended mainly on the actual cost of claims submitted for
collisions involving a given model rather than on crash tests. But
the tests usually predict the future cost of claims accurately, he
added.

 &HT;    Total System in e-commerce coalition
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A new alliance of companies, including Total System of
Columbus, announced a coalition Wednesday to introduce products and
services to bolster electronic commerce among businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The group, called the Global Commerce Alliance, plans products
for many tasks, ranging from buying and selling, billing and
bill-paying, and target marketing of goods.
</P>
<P>
   Among the members of the alliance are GE Capital, Global
Commerce Systems Inc., Sun Microsystems and SunConnect Framework,
as well as Total System Services Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the alliance was being introduced, Total System unveiled
its first product, called TSYS Total Commerce, a system for
managing a supply chain for business-to-business electronic trade.
</P>
<P>
   Total Commerce is the first in a series of products that the
alliance expects to ``co-brand.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Charron, TSYS group vice president and director of corporate
development, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``TSYS Total Commerce enables information to reach the right
part of the organization at the right time, providing access any
time, anywhere to real-time financial transaction data.''
</P>
<P>
   The product is based on contributions not only by Total System
but also by Global Commerce Systems. By enabling the users of the
product to work in real time, the new systems make sure the
businesses are on the same page as they do transactions.
</P>
<P>
   One of the objectives of the alliance is to speed transactions
and introduce streamlining impossible with paper-based
technologies. By using the special capabilities of the individual
players in the alliance, the companies said they hope to introduce
new e-commerce products and services rapidly over the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that by leveraging our large-scale credit card
transaction processing and customer self-service over the Internet
with ... (alliance members) puts us in a better position to serve
our clients around the world,'' said Philip W. Tomlinson, president
of TSYS.
</P>
<P>
   Total System is one of the world's leading processors of data
transactions involving domestic and overseas users of credit, debit
and other cards.

   BEIJING _ A senior U.S. diplomat spent Wednesday trying to
convince skeptical Chinese officials that the bombing of China's
embassy in Belgrade on the night of May 7 was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday night, neither U.S. nor Chinese officials had
disclosed what the diplomat, Undersecretary of State Thomas
Pickering, said in meetings Wednesday with China's foreign minister
and others.
</P>
<P>
   Nor had the Chinese indicated how they would respond to the
explanation or how soon they would start trying to repair relations
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering arrived in Beijing on Tuesday night with officials
from the Defense Department and intelligence agencies as well as
charts and photographs to back up his case. He was expected to give
a detailed account of how NATO planners, in part because of a
faulty map, mistakenly identified the Chinese Embassy as a Yugoslav
military site and hit it with multiple bombs.
</P>
<P>
   After meetings with unidentified officials Wednesday morning,
Pickering met Wednesday afternoon with Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan and Deputy Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi.
</P>
<P>
   China has demanded not only a full and public explanation of the
bombing but also the punishment of those responsible, a condition
the Americans may have difficulty meeting. But the United States
was prepared to discuss compensation for damages, a State
Department spokesman said in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   How the Chinese government chooses to respond to Pickering's
one-day mission may influence the future course of Chinese-U.S.
relations.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the visit's sensitivity, even the fact that the
U.S. delegation had arrived in Beijing was not reported in
newspapers Wednesday morning or on Wednesday's night's television
news.
</P>
<P>
   In the angry aftermath of the embassy attack, which killed three
Chinese journalists and created indelible images here of a
smoldering building and weeping relatives, China suspended talks
with the United States on its proposed entry into the World Trade
Organization as well as on human rights and arms control, and put
off planned military meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The two governments are now feeling their way toward a new,
perhaps more realistic, relationship than in the past, when both
spoke of building a ``constructive strategic partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   The night of the embassy bombing, China's leaders were already
angry over the NATO military campaign in Yugoslavia, which they
called an illegal intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here described the embassy bombing as a criminal act
of aggression, and encouraged the state-controlled press to run
wild with accusations that it was the intentional act of an evil
empire, out to keep China down.
</P>
<P>
   In place of last year's friendly talk of partnership, top
officials including President Jiang Zemin, began warning about U.S.
plans for global domination, although they always maintained that
business ties should continue.
</P>
<P>
   When news of the bombing broke, latent public resentment of U.S.
power erupted into days of rock-throwing demonstrations at the U.S.
Embassy, mainly by students. Their fury was genuine, but they also
received logistical support from the government, which seemed to
view the outpouring of nationalism as a useful way to unify the
population and divert attention from economic and political issues
at home.
</P>
<P>
   Few Chinese openly accept the proposal that the United States,
with its technological wizardry, could have hit their embassy by
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   And if Chinese do accept the U.S. excuse of an outdated map,
they have to confront another painful truth: that the United States
and NATO simply were not paying much attention to China, which
expects to be treated as a great power.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks, the vitriolic attacks on the United
States have moderated. Communist Party leaders have tried to
channel the nationalistic energy into hard work and support for the
Party in its drive to build a stronger China that can better stand
up to any attempts at foreign domination in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have stressed the need to resume business and
political ties with the United States _ after receiving an adequate
accounting of the Belgrade strike.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's newspapers reported the foreign trade minister's
statement that the right atmosphere for negotiations over China's
entry into the World Trade Organization will not be restored until
``U.S.-led NATO'' gives a satisfactory explanation for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The negotiations will be continued only if the good and
friendly atmosphere reappears,'' said the minister, Shi Guangsheng.
</P>
<P>
   Membership in the trade body has been a longtime goal of China,
and President Clinton has said he wants to see China's entry this
year. But negotiations will be difficult in any case, because the
United States insists that China make hard concessions to open up
its markets.
</P>
<P>
   As they decide how to portray Pickering's visit, the Chinese
leaders face another delicate task: how to escape from a month of
aggressive anti-American rhetoric and credibly declare the
resumption of, in Shi's words, a ``good and friendly atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Jiang and Prime Minister Zhu Rongji are pragmatists who in the
past have stressed that Western trade and investment are important
to China's economic modernization. But they cannot afford to look
weak in the face of what they personally have called U.S.
aggression.

 &HT;    Former presidents tend to invest well
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jimmy Carter, who left the White House $1 million in
debt, is a multimillionaire now. So are former Presidents George
Bush, Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton isn't wealthy yet, but Money (July), in a look at
presidential investing, says the incumbent president's blind trust
was at one point heavily invested in Internet stocks. Clinton,
however, dismissed the investment firm that had bet on the
Internet, and as a result missed a chance to earn big returns on
Amazon.com, Yahoo! and America Online.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer finance magazine's report is based on interviews
with people familiar with the investing of ex-presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Money says Ford's real estate holdings alone are worth $4.5
million, Reagan profited from investing in California real estate
and the Kennebunkport, Maine, estate George Bush bought for
$800,000 is now worth $7 million to $8 million. Carter got into
blue chips.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred high techs
</P>
<P>
   Two Atlanta companies _ BellSouth, the phone company, and
MindSpring Enterprises, the Internet access provider _ are on the
latest Business Week (June 21) list of 100 information technology
leaders. They rank 50th and 51st, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the list are America Online, Dell Computer and
Solectron. In general, the magazine says the standout companies are
the ones ``that are digging the trenches, laying the pipes and
getting their hands dirty building the new Internet economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocks with a halo
</P>
<P>
   Anheuser-Busch usually doesn't get on most lists of stocks for
socially conscious investors, but it has a stellar environmental
record, says Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine (July) in a look
at this category of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Socially conscious mutual funds usually shun companies the fund
managers think are guilty of some social misdeed, such as making
liquor or military weapons, running casinos or polluting the
environment. The problem, says the magazine, is that the fund
manager's likes and dislikes may not be the investor's likes and
dislikes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the ``safe'' stocks on Kiplinger's list are Cisco Systems
(good employee relations), Fannie Mae (helps low-income home
buyers), Hasbro (big charitable donor) and Maytag (offers rebates
to natural disaster victims).
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning ...
</P>
<P>
   _ The rise in yields is bringing bonds out of the shadows,
Fortune (July 5) reports. Even big firms such as Merrill Lynch are
beginning to offer online trading services in this usually obscure
market.
</P>
<P>
   _ Today's executive has lots of ways to keep in touch and even
be productive on the road, says Inc. Technology (Aug. 17) in a
special edition on ``cool tools for today's road warrior.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In East Africa, they are dainty and meticulous, poking a twig
into an anthill and then nibbling the insects one by one. They daub
their bodies clean with napkins made of leaves, or give themselves
a postprandial tickle with any stray object at hand.
</P>
<P>
   In West Africa, they are like children polishing off the cake
batter, sweeping up dozens of ants on a stick and then consuming
the entire swarm with a single satisfied swipe. They use sharp
objects to extract marrow from monkey bones and fan branches in the
air to swat away flies.
</P>
<P>
   They are all Pan troglodytes, or common chimpanzees, but it
turns out that they are uncommonly diverse in their skills and
habits.
</P>
<P>
   In a comprehensive synthesis that covers 151 years' worth of
chimpanzee observations, an international team of primatologists
reports that humanity's closest cousins display what was long
thought to be the sine qua non of humanness: cultural variation.
</P>
<P>
   Chimpanzees living on Africa's Ivory Coast groom, court and use
tools in a very different manner than those apes of the Gombe
forest of Tanzania; while the chimpanzees of Uganda are likewise
slaves to local fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The findings offer the most detailed evidence yet that nonhuman
animals can pick up behaviors through observation and imitation,
and then convey those learned skills to their neighbors and kin,
elements of a scientific definition of culture. The research also
helps buttress the much-beleaguerd nurture half of the endless
debate over whether nature or nurture, culture or chromosomes,
predominate in shaping behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is cultural behavior,'' Andrew Whiten of the Scottish
Primate Research Group at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland
said this week in a telephone interview. ``It's passed on by some
kind of observational learning process. One chimpanzee learns from
another, in contrast to inheriting behaviors through genetics.''
</P>
<P>
   And though some of the seven chimpanzee communities described in
the current study fall into different subspecies of P. troglodyte,
said Whiten, and thus are not genetically identical to each other,
variations in behaviors are found even between two different troops
of the same subspecies.
</P>
<P>
   Whiten is an author of the new report, which appears in
Thursday's issue of the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Animals have been shown previously to learn from their parents
and peers. Song birds, for example, are known to develop their
repertory based on the songs they hear around them. And in a famous
example of learning through imitation, a young Japanese rhesus
macaque monkey living on the island of Koshima 50 years ago,
developed the habit of washing the dirt off sweet potatoes in water
before eating them. Other macaques in the group quickly adopted the
method, and even today, long after the original potato washers have
died, Koshima macaques retain the cleansing tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have asserted that such examples were too narrow and
isolated to be counted as evidence of true culture.
</P>
<P>
   In the new report, however, the researchers list 39 different
behaviors that vary in prevalence and style among the seven
chimpanzee communities.
</P>
<P>
   In a commentary that accompanies the new report, Frans B.M. de
Waal of the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center in Atlanta,
points out that some hardcore anthropologists and psychologists
have sought for years to keep the ``culture'' tag unique to human
beings, an exclusionary desire that has demanded increasingly
elaborate definitions of the term.
</P>
<P>
   The latest record of chimpanzee inventiveness and diversity, he
writes, ``is so impressive that it will be hard to keep these apes
out of the cultural domain without once again moving the goal
posts.''
</P>
<P>
   In the current paper, nine primatologists, including renowned
figures like Jane Goodall of the Gombe Stream Research Center,
Richard Wrangham of Harvard University and Toshisada Nishida of
Kyoto University, set aside their often competitive ways to pool
their years of painstaking observations from field studies that
ranged from eight to 38 years.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers first compiled a list of 65 candidate behaviors
that they suspected might be specific to different chimpanzee
communities. Some of the proposed behaviors turned out not to be
unique at all, but rather nearly universal, while others varied for
reasons easily explained by the local ecology. For example, the
decision about where to build a sleeping nest appeared to depend
more on local predators than on prevailing community taste.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the researchers came up with 39 different behavior
patterns that fit their definition of cultural variation, meaning
they were customary in some communities and absent in others, for
reasons that could only be explained by learning or imitation.
</P>
<P>
   In the Tai forest of the Ivory Coast, for example, the custom,
when grooming another ape, is to pick off a parasite and then
squash it on one's own forearm. Among Gombe chimpanzees, the
preferred method is to remove the flea or tick and mash it with a
leaf. The chimpanzees of Budongo forest of Uganda pick off the
insect, put it on a leaf for inspection, and then decide whether it
will eat the insect or toss it away.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``This may seem subtle and odd to us, because we don't groom
each other,'' Whiten said. ``But among chimpanzees, grooming is
very important, and these may be the chimpanzee equivalents of
human differences in greeting, where some cultures shake hands,
others kiss on both sides of the cheek, and still others rub
noses.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the cultural behaviors have an almost religious sense to
them. In six of the seven communities, the chimpanzees perform a
rain dance, a slow display at the start of rain. ``You're in awe
when you see this,'' said Pascal Gagneux of the University of
California at San Diego, who spent two years in the Tai forest
studying chimpanzees, but did not contribute to the current report.
``The chimpanzees go into a quasi-trance, dancing even when they're
alone, with no spectators, as if they were ritually celebrating the
rainstorm.''
</P>
<P>
   Courting styles also exhibit considerable variation, just as
they do among humans. In some places, the males knock on tree
trunks to attract a female's attention, in other locales they swish
vegetation around, while in still other communities the males
perform an irresistible operation called leaf-clipping.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hold a leaf in their mouth and clip bits off in a noisy
way,'' Whiten said. Courtship behaviors, he speculated, could be
one arena where it is particularly crucial that a suitor show he is
up on the latest fashions.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers cannot yet say exactly how cultural behaviors
are transmitted among chimpanzees. They only rarely have observed
examples of true teaching, when one ape, usually a parent, corrects
the fumbling attempts of a young ape to do something like crack
open a nut. Nor are they certain how venerable or stable many of
the local traditions are _ that is, through how many generations
they have been passed. Only in the Gombe, the site of the longest
field study to date, can scientists confirm that some behaviors
like termite fishing with leaves, have persisted through three
generations.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the simian traditions will continue anywhere remains
open to doubt. The primatologists warn that chimpanzees everywhere
have lately been under tremendous pressure and assault. Not only is
their habitat being thwacked away by the millions of acres each
year, but roads built for logging have also stimulated a thriving
market in primate meat, called bush meat.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists estimate that at least 4,000 wild chimpanzees
are shot and shipped out of the African forest annually to satisfy
local and more distant tastes for ape steaks. A century ago, there
were millions of chimpanzees across Africa, the scientists said.
Today, there are fewer than 200,000. If current trends continue,
the scientists say, the only culture chimpanzees may be left with
is that of a zoo.

 &HT;    Study finds one sure bet: Casinos bring higher crime
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Move a casino into your back yard and it's probably
not going to kill you. But every other major crime tracked by the
FBI will go up within four years after a casino comes to town,
according to a study done jointly by professors at the University
of Georgia and the University of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   The study by Georgia economics Professor David B. Mustard and
Illinois economic Professor Earl L. Grinols _ which examined crime
rates for every county in the United States from 1977 to 1996 _
concluded that crimes related to casinos cost each American adult
$63 in 1996. By comparison, crime brought on by casino gambling
cost every adult $1.10 or less until 1984 and between $5 and $9
through 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The crime-related expense of casinos could rise by an estimated
$12.1 billion nationally if the gambling expands to other areas of
the country, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Except for murder, all major crimes tracked by the FBI _ rape,
robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and auto theft _
increased significantly after counties allowed casinos to open,
according to Mustard's analysis.
</P>
<P>
   From Mississippi to Louisiana, from Nevada to New Jersey, crime
rates in casino counties were 8 percent higher after the casinos
arrived, Mustard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will see an increase in the crime rate there greater than
if you hadn't brought in a casino,'' Mustard said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mustard said his conclusions are probably harsher than the
findings of the National Gambling Impact Study Commission, which
will release its final report Friday. That report will cover all
forms of gambling in the United States, including casinos and
state-run lotteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission is a group of political appointees and three
are very friendly with the casino industry,'' Mustard said.
``Wherever you think the truth may be, there's sure to be some
political aim'' in the commission's report.
</P>
<P>
   The professors' report also goes against current public
sentiment. In a Gallup poll released Wednesday, 67 percent of those
surveyed said they believe that opening a casino helps a
community's economy and three-fourths said they approve of state
lotteries.
</P>
<P>
   Casinos bring short-term economic benefits at the outset, the
study by Mustard and Grinols conceded. Construction jobs surge.
Low-skilled workers find work, leading to an initial drop in crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Decaying waterfronts and derelict sections of town that once
harbored crime may be less amenable to it when renovation occurs,
street lights appear and police presence increases,'' the study
said. ``The streets near Las Vegas casinos, even at night, are
often cited as some of the safest.''
</P>
<P>
   However, by the fourth year, property crimes like larceny &Cx1f;  _
stealing from cars, pickpocketing, purse-snatching and the like  &Cx1f; _
rise consistently. The crime increases are in part attributed to
pathological gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes time before they start committing crimes,'' Mustard
said. ``It takes time before they start drying up their
resources.''
</P>
<P>
   The study is expected to fuel debate, particularly in Kentucky,
where incumbent Gov. Paul Patton has proposed allowing land-based
casinos in order to combat the economic drain caused by casinos in
Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where you're considering casinos, you need to look at all the
costs and benefits,'' Mustard said. ``Crime is one of the puzzle
pieces _ and it's a significant piece.

CULTURE WAR RAGES IN HOUSE AS PRESIDENT SCRAMBLES FOR VOTES ON GUN
CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CONGRESS-GUNS-SCENE) 
(rm) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL and FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bitterly divided House plunged Wednesday into the
nation's culture wars, passionately debating into the evening
whether school prayer, a clampdown on media violence, religion or
gun control was the answer to the series of school shootings that
have left scores of teen-agers dead.
</P>
<P>
   The debate marked the beginning of a two- to three-day
free-for-all as the House considered 44 amendments on cultural
issues and crime and 11 gun-control proposals. In a blow to social
conservatives, the House on Wednesday night voted 282-146 to reject
a measure sponsored by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill, that would have made
it a crime to expose children to movies, books or video games
containing explicit sex or violence.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous Republicans _ including three members of Hyde's
Judiciary Committee who were once his co-impeachment managers _
crossed the chamber to agree with the Democrats that Hyde's
legislation was an unconstituional abridgement of the First
Amendment's right of free speech. Ninety-two Republicans joined
with 189 Democrats and 1 independent to defeat the measure, while
127 Republicans and 19 Democrats voted for it.
</P>
<P>
   But if they suffered a loss, the conservatives did get their day
on the stage as the House Republican leaders made sure the cultural
debate came ahead of the gun control debate preferred by Democrats.
The scheduling gave Republican after Republican a prime-time
platform to argue that it was not guns, but a depraved culture and
a glorification of violence that had led to the school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Tom DeLay, the House minority whip, delivered several thundering
lamentations on the House floor, brushing aside the gun debate to
blame American culture as the source of youth violence. He
pointedly read aloud a letter sent to a local Texas newspaper that
condemned everything from birth control, to day care to the absence
of prayer in school.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating the words of the letter-writer, DeLay bitingly asked
why school shootings happen. ``It couldn't have been that we place
our children in day-care centers,'' DeLay said. ``It couldn't have
been, historically, that our children, seen as blessings from God,
are now considered mistakes when contraception fails.''
</P>
<P>
   As the debate raged on the House floor, a fierce struggle for
votes was being waged behind the scenes over gun control.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, flying to Geneva in advance of a meeting with
leaders of the world's industrialized nations and Russia,
telephoned two wavering Democrats _ Nick Lampson of Texas and Bob
Etheridge of North Carolina _ to urge them to support a measure
sponsored by Rep. Carolyn McCarthy of Long Island that would
regulate sales at gun shows nearly as stringently as the Senate
voted to do last month.
</P>
<P>
   The president also sent a letter to moderate Republicans who had
voted for background checks for handguns six years ago, imploring
them to put ``the interests of the American people over the clout
of the gun lobby.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the issue, a dozen National Rifle
Association lobbyists worked Capitol Hill. And DeLay similarly
sought to rally some of the most conservative members of his party
around a weaker gun show measure that has been proposed by a
Democrat, Rep. John Dingell of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay told them that if they tried to vote against all gun
control, they might inadvertently help the Democrats. ``It's a
dilemma,'' the Texan said. ``You hate to vote for any gun control
if you're a defender of the Second Amendment. At the same time,
what do you do to stop the gun control people?''
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the emotions of the day, Mrs. McCarthy choked back
tears at one news conference where she and another lawmaker were
displaying weapons that could be purchased at gun shows. She said
one of them reminded her of the gun that had killed her husband on
the Long Island railroad shooting of 1993. ``This is personal to
me,'' she had said earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House minority leader, told reporters
Wednesday night that he expected to lose about 45 Democrats when
the McCarthy measure comes to the floor. He said that would mean
gun control advocates would need to pick up 51 Republican votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a chance to do that,'' he said. But he
complained that moderate Republicans did not seem to be lobbying
their colleagues as aggressively as they could. In a backhanded
compliment to the National Rifle Association and DeLay, Gephardt
said, ``We're up against the best lobby in town and we're up
against Tom DeLay's whip organization.'' His comments minimized the
role of Dingell, a fellow Democrat fighting at DeLay's side.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., who is co-sponsoring Mrs. McCarthy's
measure, said she could not say how many Republicans would vote
with her. ``I have not been going around counting noses,'' she
said. In another effort to draw Republicans, Democrats recruited
Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., to join them in sponsoring one
comprehensive gun control measure.
</P>
<P>
   Wavering Republicans were under all kinds of pressure. Michael
Long, the chairman of the New York State Conservative Party, for
example, sent a letter to New York Republicans calling Dingell's
amendment essential. That posed a political bind for Rep. Rick
Lazio who may challenge Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for the Republican
nomination for the Senate next year.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has not returned calls from reporters in recent days and
an aide said she did not know how he would vote on gun measures.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Dennis Hastert has cast the gun control vote as a matter
of conscience. But Delay, his third in command, has been working to
pass the Dingell measure. DeLay said today he is not cajoling
Republicans to vote Dingell's way but only telling them that he
planned to vote with Dingell in order to keep gun control advocates
from prevailing.
</P>
<P>
   He delivered that message to some 24 to 30 of the most
conservative members of the House over Chinese food in his office
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Dingell's gun show amendment is the least stringent version that
will come before the House. Republicans fear it could yet be
defeated if more than a dozen conservatives decide that they cannot
abide any kind of gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, DeLay, the hard-driving majority whip, was
everywhere. He made a star turn at a rally, for ``God not guns,''
on the Capitol grounds with black and Hispanic ministers from New
York, whose followers waved their Bibles in the air to punctuate
the speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``What message is sent when it is illegal to pray in schools?''
the Texan asked. ``This rejection of God must change.'' He said
that in the battle against a decadent culture ``we all need to
understand that you cannot stand up for America _ you need to kneel
down for America and stand up for God.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite the day's heated arguments over amendments, the basic
bill the House was debating is a bipartisan juvenile crime
initiative that allocates $1.5 billion in block grants to state and
local governments for aggressive prosecution, punishment and
prevention of juvenile crime.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the prevention and punishment measures yielded little
dispute and were passed by simple voice votes. They included block
grants to help local governments computerize their juvenile records
and mandatory life imprisonment for people convicted of a second
sexual offense against a child.
</P>
<P>
   A proposal by Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., that included stiff
mandatory minimum sentences for crimes involving guns and children,
was opposed by many liberal Democrats but passed by a vote of
249-181.
</P>
<P>
   Other amendments provoked fierce disagreement, such as Hyde's
proposal to bar youths from being sold or shown violent
entertainment, books or video games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entertainment industry gets away, literally, with
murder,'' Hyde said. In a plea for the country to examine what
makes teenagers kill, he said, ``Anybody that doesn't think rotten
movies, rotten rap lyrics, rotten video games aren't poisoning _
toxically poisoning _ our kids' minds and making some kids think
that's acceptable, just isn't paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally impassioned, Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., countered that
Hyde's legislation ``grows the government ever larger'' and would
require a police force to determine ``what is decent.'' Asking what
movies would be banned from teenagers under the bill, he asked,
``Is that a movie like `Home Alone,' is that a movie like `Ben Hur'
is that a movie like `Private Ryan?' ''

GREENE BREAKS WORLD RECORD IN 100 METERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Kan., Mo.) (rk) 
 By   FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Little more than two weeks ago, after he had won the 200-meter
dash in the Track and Field Association pro championships in
Uniondale, N.Y., Maurice Greene talked about world records.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't try to break them,'' he said. ``You prepare the best
you can, and they will come.''
</P>
<P>
   For the 24-year-old American, a world champion outdoors and
indoors, the best possible record came Wednesday night in Athens in
a second-tier meet on the Grand Prix international circuit.
</P>
<P>
   He smashed the world record for the classic sprint distance of
100 meters, his time of 9.79 seconds 0.05 of a second faster than
the record set in 1996 by Donovan Bailey of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   That was the widest margin by which the 100-meter record had
been broken since electronic timing became standard in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Only Bailey (9.84) and Leroy Burrell of Philadelphia (9.85 in
1994) had run a legal 100 meters faster than Greene's previous best
of 9.86. Ben Johnson of Canada ran 9.83 in 1987 and 9.79 in the
1988 Seoul Olympics, but when his post-race drug test in the
Olympics disclosed traces of a banned anabolic steroid,
international officials threw both records out.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's previous best came on the same Athens track in winning
the 1997 world outdoor championship, so after Wednesday's race he
said, ``This is a special race for me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also special for Ato Boldon of Trinidad, whose
second-place time of 9.86 matched his fastest ever.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, Boldon and another of the world's fastest sprinters, Jon
Drummond, train together in Los Angeles under John Smith, an
assistant coach at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 feet 9 inches and 165 pounds, with an upper body built up
by weight training, Greene is almost burly. He comes from Kansas
City, Kan., and was almost unknown until the 1995 Texas Relays,
when he upset Carl Lewis in the 100 in the wind-aided time of 9.88
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   After the race, Lewis was asked if he knew much about Maurice
Greene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who?'' Lewis replied.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, slowed by a strained hamstring muscle, Greene failed to
qualify for the 100-meter final in the U.S. Olympic trials. He
drove from Kansas City to Atlanta for the Olympics, watched the 100
and cried.
</P>
<P>
   He returned home and made a career decision. Since he was 8
years old, he had been coached by Al Hobson. With Hobson's
blessing, he decided to move to California and train with Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only stay in your mama's house so long and then you
have to leave,'' Greene said. ``That's how it was with Al. It was
time to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene had had short stays at Kansas City Junior College and
then Park College in Parksville, Mo., but never had the advantage
of big-time college competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was technically sound when he came to me,'' said Smith, the
world record-holder in the 440-yard dash, ``so it was just a case
of making improvements.''
</P>
<P>
   The improvements quickly led to world and American championships
and a No. 1 world ranking. They also led Greene to the realization
that his future was unlimited. Before the 1997 world outdoor
championships, he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``People are saying that American sprinting is down, that we're
not any good, that we're lost. I don't feel that way. It's just
time for someone to step up and say, `I'm going to carry American
sprinting on my back.' I'm here to take responsibility for American
sprinting. I'm going to carry it as far as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   He accepted that responsibility then and again Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After his race on the track that will be the main site for the
2004 Olympics, he could not find an American flag for a victory
lap. So, to a standing ovation from the crowd of 30,000, he waved
the banner of his club, HSI, which stands for Handling Speed
Intelligently.
</P>
<P>
   On a hot, almost windless evening, his record came in a special
race. Earlier, Boldon had won the regular 100 in 9.97 seconds, and
two hours after the record race Boldon beat Greene at 200 meters,
19.86 seconds to 20.03.
</P>
<P>
   The meet produced other stunning performances, including 19 feet
10\ inches by Maksim Tarasov of Russia and 19-8\ by Jeff Hartwig in
the men's pole vault, 13.11 seconds by Larry Wade in the men's
110-meter hurdles, 3 minutes 31.32 seconds by Noah Ngeny of Kenya
in the men's 1,500 meters and 22.10 by Inger Miller in the women's
200 meters.
</P>
<P>
   But the night belonged to Greene, who at home drives a
Mercedes-Benz that has the license plate ``MO GOLD,'' and he
promised more to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected it,'' he said of his record. ``This is only the
beginning.''

<P>
   KORONICE, Yugoslavia _ For the last four days, Tom Dedaj has
been going house to house in search of the unburied horrors of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   They are not hard to find here. A severed foot lies on the grass
of the cemetery. Three doors down from his house, the charred
bodies of five friends are strewn in a rubble-filled room. His own
aunt lies, a mass of lumps and ashes, in her front hallway.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he took a lawyer with Human Rights Watch on a tour
of what he had found, as Kosovo's tragedy entered its next phase:
documenting exactly what has happened since March, with an eye
toward punishing the guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts of killings of civilians in Kosovo have so far been
secondhand _ or even more distant _ based on interviews in refugee
camps in Macedonia and Albania, with no way to confirm the reports.
</P>
<P>
   Now that NATO peacekeepers and other outsiders have entered the
province, they are collecting evidence in village after village in
an attempt to assemble a complete picture of the civilian toll of
the Kosovo war.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on investigation is evident around the province as
NATO troops, who have been in Kosovo only since Saturday, have
moved to secure sites where mass killings are said to have been
carried out. In fact, Wednesday morning, Brigadier Gen. Fritz von
Korff, the commander of the German sector, which has several mass
grave cites, told reporters that NATO would start using the phrase
``crime scene'' instead of ``mass grave.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, there is no evidence of massacres of the astonishing
scale of the one in Srebrenica, the village in Bosnia where Serbian
forces killed as many as 7,000 people in 1995. But after only a few
days of open access to Kosovo, it is becoming clear there may be
hundreds and hundreds of smaller sites with numbers of victims
ranging from one or two to perhaps several hundred.
</P>
<P>
   And while most victims are buried under newly churned earth, it
is also clear, from a tour of this village and several others
within a few miles, that there is much evidence in plain view.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing several sites Wednesday, including Koronice and
Meja _ and finding more than a dozen unburied bodies _ the Human
Rights Watch lawyer, Joanne Mariner, said she could draw a few
preliminary conclusions about the deaths of civilians: ``We knew a
lot of people were killed but we're finding a lot more than we
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You add it up and it adds up to a lot of deaths,'' she said.
``It's systematic. There were a lot of people involved. It wasn't
some aberration that people were killed.''
</P>
<P>
   But proving exactly what happened _ and exactly who did what _
may be a difficult task. Ms. Mariner said that even after extensive
interviews with refugees, and the beginnings of interviews inside
Kosovo, she has heard relatively few names of people accused of the
killings. Some of the killers were masked, she said witnesses told
her; some were strangers. Often there were no witnesses at all.
</P>
<P>
   And finding witnesses who can agree on details of killings is
equally hard. There is no doubt that many people were killed here,
and in the neighboring village of Meja, just outside Djakovica. But
the accounts can be strikingly different.
</P>
<P>
   In Meja, the remains of six men, all in civilian clothes, still
lie scattered around a ditch. One man in a leather jacket had no
head. A pair of pants was filled by a single leg, with a black shoe
and blue sock still at the end of it. A stretch of ground near a
cemetery, apparently the killing ground, is littered with human
teeth, bits of skull and the pink plastic of shattered dentures.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, refugees and villagers say there appeared to be
two sets of killings on the same day: In Meja, Serbian forces and
paramilitaries, they say, separated the men from women and children
in a huge convoy of ethnic Albanians fleeing from Kosovo on April
27, killing between 100 and 300 of the men.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Koronice, villagers say that these same forces killed as
many as 100 more people, burning many of them in their own homes:
Dedaj, a 38-year-old farmer, recognized his aunt by the jewelry on
the floor and a necklace she had tucked away in her bra. He
recognized an 80-year-old man by a metal box he found next to the
body with the man's pocket watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a person who is mentally ill or sick can do this,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Both mass killings appeared to be in retaliation for an attack
by the Kosovo Liberation Army in Meja in which five Serbian police
officers were killed.
</P>
<P>
   But Kurtshtest Morina, a 30-year-old sanitation worker, said
Wednesday that it was his job to drive people from where they were
killed to the cemetery in Koronice and he saw at most 40 bodies in
the last few months.
</P>
<P>
   He is a Gypsy and was not targeted by Serbian forces as the
ethnic Albanians were. He conceded that Serbian forces might have
buried more bodies on their own, but he had not heard of hundreds
of people being killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might have been more that I haven't seen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Morina said that the Serbian forces were meticulous about how
they buried the dead.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``They would take pictures of the bodies,'' he said. ``They
would write down the names of the dead. They would attach a number
to the corpse. And according to that number they would bury the
body.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the grave would have a number,'' he said. ``They were
very organized.''
</P>
<P>
   The same questions and contradictions are surfacing in other
areas of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In Drenica, the heartland of the Kosovo Liberation Army, a day
after Serbian forces largely withdrew, signs of death were
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   In the village of Makermal, near Drenica, Habib Gjinovci, a
farmer and KLA fighter, was trying to figure out whose blackened
skull was lying in the charred wreckage of his corn hutch. He said
the remains he found might be those of a teen-age boy Serbs
captured a month ago with roughly 20 others.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the size of the skull, it could be a woman or a child,''
he said. ``There were some kids who were 14 or 15 arrested that
day.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Serbs withdrew from the village on Monday, returning
Albanians found eight fresh graves in the cemetery. They dug up two
of them and found several sets of charred bones in each grave, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the village of Rezalle, KLA, soldiers dug up what they
thought would be a mass grave only to find a dead cow.
</P>
<P>
   Two local Albanian rebels said the grave formerly held the
bodies of 50 to 80 Albanians killed by Serbian soldiers on April 5.
Observing from across the front line, the two soldiers, Aziz Aruqa
and Musa Derguti, said that they saw Serbs bury the bodies in the
mass grave. But two weeks ago the Serbs returned with heavy
equipment, removed the bodies and then shot cows and buried them in
the pit, the soldiers said.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees who fled Poklek, a KLA-controlled village at the
southern end of the Drenica region in May, carried with them the
tale of a mass killing of women and children there April 17.
</P>
<P>
   The home of Qamil Mucolli, the scene of the deaths, has become a
shrine to the 50 people killed that day. Mucolli, a 27-year-old KLA
fighter, said his wife, his two small daughters, his parents and
four sisters were among those killed when a Serbian soldier threw a
hand grenade into the crowded first-floor room. Mucolli, who was
fighting with the rebels at the time, said he understood that the
Serbian assailant then opened fire with his assault rifle, killing
all but four of the people inside. The Serbs burnt the bodies that
day in the room where they died, leaving it charred. Later the
rebels collected the bones for safekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in his basement, Mucolli pointed out how blood from the
first floor had trickled down through the ceiling and along the
basement walls to form dark red pools on the floor. Two months
after the attack, the pools of blood are black and untouched except
by the mold growing on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not cleaned it,'' he said, ``because we want everyone
to see the evidence.''

 &HT;    Some right at home with Pinehurst
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ To many American golfers, this place feels
foreign. And not just because of the Europeanlike traffic circles.
</P>
<P>
   This small town's most treasured antique _ a 99-year-old golf
course _ feels like it was shipped across an ocean.
</P>
<P>
   And after taking spins around Pinehurst No. 2, testing out the
greens that look like flipped-over bowls, foreign players were
beaming. Greg Norman said the course reminded him of ones he grew
up with in Australia. He also proclaimed this U.S. Open to be the
best one he's ever played in _ never mind that it doesn't start
until this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of an open Open,'' he said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, here's the thing: The world's hottest player, a 27-year-old
who was born and raised in Jacksonville, Fla., feels right at home
here, too.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval learned to play golf on the banks of the St. John's
River at Timquana Country Club _ a course designed by Donald Ross,
the same man responsible for the unique character of Pinehurst No.
2.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Timquana) is not a world-famous one like this, but you can
still see some of the same thinking involved,'' Duval said.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Duval talks like he believes course No. 2
will produce major title No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   He has won 11 PGA Tour events, including four this year. He has
passed Tiger Woods and taken over the No. 1 spot in the rankings.
He is, by all accounts, a big part of the future of golf.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as of today, he is to golf what Andre Agassi once was to
tennis _ a player who has collected a lot of money and attention
without winning one of the four majors.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like Duval would win the Masters last year. He led by
three strokes with three holes to play . . . and finished tied for
second.
</P>
<P>
   He began this year by winning the Mercedes Championships and the
Bob Hope Classic, finishing each tournament at 26-under par. He
added titles at the Players Championship and BellSouth Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after a sixth-place finish at the Masters, he began to
struggle. He shot a 78 on the third day of the Houston Open and
finished tied for 64th. He went to New Orleans and didn't make the
cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wasn't as ready to play as I would like to be when I
got to Houston,'' he said. ``Maybe it's just I was more drained
from those three weeks before than I had expected. So I chose not
to play for a little while, to get try to get back and get ready.''
</P>
<P>
   After placing third at the Memorial, he returned home feeling as
if everything was in place for the Open.
</P>
<P>
   Then he decided to make coffee.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't necessarily stunning news that Duval hurt himself.
Just the way he did it.
</P>
<P>
   He is known as a bit of a thrill-seeker. Within three weeks of a
record-setting 59 in the final round of the Chrysler Classic, he
was flying down the ski slopes on a snowboard.
</P>
<P>
   He survived that. The injury came last Friday when he grabbed a
scalding pot and sustained second-degree burns on his right thumb
and forefinger.
</P>
<P>
   His practice time for the Open has been hampered. His fingers
are bandaged. And he wasn't able to get in a full practice round
until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, after that round, Duval seemed more annoyed with the fuss
being made over his fingers than the actual injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like all I've been talking about,'' he said. ``It
hasn't hampered anything. It hasn't prevented me from performing as
I would like this week. So it wasn't exactly the greatest of
timing, but it looks like it's going to be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Just because Duval burned his hand doesn't mean he is doomed to
join Irving Fryar (kitchen knife) and Bob Ojeda (lawn shears) in
the Home Injury Hall of Shame.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he will be like Gary Player.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, Player sliced his finger opening a tin of fruit, then
went on to win the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   In a media poll done this week, one journalist actually cited
Duval's injury as the reason for picking him to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has no pressure,'' said Tetsuya Kano of Nippon Broadcasting
System.
</P>
<P>
   More voters, however, believe this U.S. Open will not be won by
the No.1-ranked player. They picked Spain's Jose Maria Olazabal,
the Masters champion, to win _ and become the first European to
capture the U.S. Open title since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Norman also put Olazabal atop his list of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jose Maria comes to mind, because of some of the shots he
played around Augusta National,'' Norman said. ``The little
bump-and-run shots. He's got the visualization, the imagination and
creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he feels at home here.
</P>
<P>
   But so does the Florida native with the, uh, hot hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the course suits me well,'' Duval said. ``It seems to
set up for me well.''

RETURN TO KOSOVO `LIKE THE OKLAHOMA LAND RUSH'

   BLACE, Macedonia _ Thousands of ethnic Albanians joyously left
Macedonia and Albania for home Wednesday, ignoring warnings that it
was not yet safe for them to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the Oklahoma land rush,'' said Franci Smajlagic, a
United Nations aid worker who watched the movement of people near
the Macedonia-Kosovo border.
</P>
<P>
   More than 14,000 refugees poured into the province Wednesday,
some 3,000 from Macedonia and 11,000 from Albania.
</P>
<P>
   They crossed into Kosovo by car, taxi, tractor and by foot. Some
carried blankets and clothing, others food unavailable in Kosovo _
sugar, oil, peppers, tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to go home as soon as possible,'' said Bukurije
Topani, 36, who was traveling with her husband, four children and a
dozen members of her extended family, all bound for their mountain
village in southern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   They ignored pleas from the United Nations relief agency to wait
until it could organize a safer and more orderly return. ``They're
going back in too much of a hurry,'' complained Smajlagic, the U.N.
aid worker. ``It's understandable but it's not rational. We can't
provide security.''
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for the U.N. relief agency indicated that some
authorities had given up trying to stop the rush home. ``Once this
thing gathers momentum there's a snowball effect and you can't stop
it,'' said Judith Kumin.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, the provincial capital, the Yugoslav army pulled
its last troops out of the city, and Serb civilians, fearful of
retaliatory attacks, thronged the bus station for a ride north,
with some offering wads of cash for a seat.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Artemije of the Serbian Orthodox Church, who had urged
Serbs in Kosovo's second-largest city to remain, joined their
flight. Under escort by German peacekeepers, and jeers from
returning ethnic Albanians, the bishop and a number of Serb
families left Prizren for Pristina, the German command said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's commander for Kosovo, British Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson,
urged all Serbs to stay put, promising that his troops ``would have
the same attitude toward everyone.'' In another apparent attempt to
calm the Serbs, NATO's spokesmen announced that a U.S. Marine
detachment had disarmed 200 Kosovo rebels near Pristina and
detained six of their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians have accused Serb forces and paramilitaries of
committing atrocities during NATO's 11-week air campaign. New
evidence of atrocities was found Wednesday around Kosovo by NATO
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, in Helsinki, Finland, U.S. officials met with Russian
authorities and later said they had made some progress toward
resolving a standoff over Moscow's role in the peacekeeping
operation. The negotiations are continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Here on Macedonia's border with Kosovo, the refugees were
restless to go home Wednesday morning. Their impatience was
underscored when a police officer blew his whistle and dozens
sprinted to their cars.
</P>
<P>
   Border officials struggled to deal with long lines of cars and
crowds of people crossing on foot.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. refugee agency has been trying to discourage the
Kosovar Albanians from returning immediately for several reasons.
NATO troops have secured main highways and major towns, but not
villages and the roads that connect them. Plus, the sheer amount of
destruction is vast, including burned houses and tainted water
sources. And food is scarce, since most farmers were not able to
plant their spring crops.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest problem, relief workers say, is the danger of
mines, booby-trapped houses and unexploded shells. On Tuesday, a
woman was killed and her husband was injured when she stepped on a
mine in the first town across the border from Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, U.N. workers were handing out leaflets to the
returning refugees that warned about land mines. ``Your life is
worth your being patient for a few more weeks,'' said one of the
leaflets. But few, if any, people turned back.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the refugees were not going home heedlessly. The danger of
land mines was on many minds. Some said they knew from other people
that their homes were safe. Others said they intended to be
careful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my children not to touch anything even before we came
to Macedonia,'' said Bukurije Topani, who set off for home with 17
members of her extended family.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people who crossed the border here Wednesday were
men going to see their houses for the first time since being
expelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the heads of the family,'' said Bexhed Karaliti, 65,
who was accompanied by his elderly cousin, Rexhep Karaliti, and his
one unmarried son, Sadik. ``We are going to see if our houses are
OK or if they are burned.'' Only later, they explained, would they
fetch the rest of their family.
</P>
<P>
   But many families also were on the move Wednesday. Sami Delija,
a 31-year-old doctor, arrived at the border with his wife and four
children in a van packed with 17 refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that Kosovo is safe and that peace has won,'' he said.
``We are afraid that the organized way is going to take a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The stream of refugees pouring into Kosovo bore an uncanny
resemblance to the exodus of more than 860,000 refugees out of the
province during the two-and-a-half months of NATO bombing. But this
time the refugees were hurrying over the border not in terror but
with joy and expectation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe I can go so soon,'' said 9-year-old Adelina
Delija, Sami Delija's daughter. ``I'm so happy.''
</P>
<P>
   A skinny girl with short brown hair and a quick smile, she
hopped from foot to foot and insisted on reciting a poem that she
wrote in honor of her grandfather, who died in a massacre in
central Kosovo last September.
</P>
<P>
   The joy at returning was tempered with sorrow for family members
lost to the violence of Serb ``ethnic cleansing.'' And fears
lingered. Ten-year-old Blearta Topani was looking forward to
hugging her grandfather, who had stayed behind in Kosovo, and to
start school again. But she still could not shake the terror of the
police that has stayed with her since the family fled from their
village two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``She can't believe there are no Serbs there,'' her mother said.
``Until she sees with her own eyes, she won't be convinced.''

HOLBROOKE NOMINATION TO U.N. MAY BE JEOPARDIZED BY HELMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Jesse Helms, chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee, is refusing to say whether he will allow a vote on the
long-stalled nomination of Richard Holbrooke to be the U.S.
representative at the United Nations, raising the question of
whether the nomination might die before it reaches the Senate
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials and other lawmakers say they
believe that Helms will eventually allow a vote and that Holbrooke
will be confirmed. But they acknowledge they are unnerved by the
senator's silence on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Confirmation hearings for Holbrooke are scheduled to begin
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Helms, who has said that he cannot recall another Cabinet-level
nomination ``with so much ethical baggage,'' has used similar
procedural tactics before to kill prominent nominations. In 1997,
he refused to allow confirmation hearings or a vote on the
nomination of a fellow Republican, former Massachusetts Gov.
William Weld, to be ambassador to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The fiercely conservative 77-year-old North Carolina Republican
has the power as chairman to ignore the broad, bipartisan support
that Holbrooke enjoys in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Holbrooke has some explaining to do,'' the senator said in
a statement this month announcing the schedule for the confirmation
hearings. ``I have not come to a judgment on Mr. Holbrooke's
nomination. However, I must confess that I cannot recall another
Cabinet-level nomination sent to this committee with so much
ethical baggage attached to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms said in his statement that he would grill Holbrooke, a
veteran diplomat turned $1 million-a-year investment banker, about
the ethical problems that may have been created by his
revolving-door career between the government and Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Holbrooke agreed to pay $5,000 to the Justice
Department to settle civil charges that he had violated federal
lobbying laws when, shortly after leaving the State Department in
1996, he sought help from the U.S. ambassador to South Korea in
setting up appointments there.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke did not admit to wrongdoing and insisted that he
accepted the terms of the settlement only because he wanted to move
forward with his nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Helms said he would also closely question Holbrooke, President
Clinton's longtime envoy to the Balkans and the architect of the
1995 peace agreement that ended the war in Bosnia, about ``his role
and responsibility for this administration's misguided policy of
appeasing Slobodan Milosevic,'' the Serbian leader.
</P>
<P>
   The statement added: ``No vote on the nomination has been
scheduled.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration and congressional officials agree that in
Helms, Holbrooke _ whose nomination has survived a year of close
scrutiny, including two federal ethics investigations _ appears to
face the final hurdle in his quest to run the U.S. Mission to the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fluid situation,'' said Marc Thiessen, the senator's
spokesman on the committee. ``I think the facts will be laid out
and Mr. Holbrooke's fate is in his own hands.''

 &HT;    It's tee time at first Nike Dayton Open
 &HT;    By Bucky Albers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Softened by heavy rain Monday and Tuesday,
Centerville's Golf Club at Yankee Trace is bracing itself today for
an assault on par the likes of which it hasn't seen in its first
five years.
</P>
<P>
   A field of 144 players _ including 51 who have had PGA Tour
cards at one time or another _ will tee it up in the first Nike
Dayton Open. It's a four-day, 72-hole event that replaced the Nike
Miami Valley Open held for the last six years in Springboro.
</P>
<P>
   The players have been impressed with the 7,139-yard Yankee Trace
course, the clubhouse and practice facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've traveled the country and this is as good a public golf
course as I've ever played,'' said Brian Claar, who has played the
PGA Tour for 13 years. ``What really impresses me is the practice
area. They should be pretty darned proud of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Claar estimated that a score of 12 or 15 under par will win the
tournament ``if the weather isn't crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   The winning score last year at the par 70 Heatherwoode course,
where runner-up Doug Dunakey fired a 12-under-par 59 in the second
round, was 266 (14 under par) by Craig Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee Trace has some deep and wiry rough, but Claar says it is
spotty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen places where it's U.S. Open-like and places where
you can play out of it,'' Claar said. ``There will be some luck
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The winner gets $45,000 from the $250,000 purse, but a couple of
Kansans could win much more than that.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Gogel and Steve Gotsche each have two victories this
season, and would get an immediate ``battlefield promotion'' to the
PGA Tour if they win No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Gogel is a 28-year-old from Overland Park who has won four of
the last 23 Nike events, including the last 10 tournaments of 1998.
He has earned $234,244 in that period.
</P>
<P>
   When he won last week's Nike Cleveland Open by eagling the
second hole in a playoff against Casey Martin, he became the first
Nike member to win three playoffs. He is the only player to win two
Nike events in successive years.
</P>
<P>
   By finishing 16th on the Nike money list last season, Gogel
missed by one spot a promotion to the PGA Tour this season.
</P>
<P>
   Gotsche, a 37-year-old veteran of 15 professional seasons, has
bounced back impressively after going through 1998 without playing
privileges on either the Nike or PGA tour. While biding his time,
he played mini-tour events in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all kinds of state opens in Texas, Nebraska, South
Dakota, Colorado, Missouri,'' said Gotsche, who lives in Great
Bend, Kansas. ``I played the Prairie Golf Tour and Lone Star
Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Gotsche said he won three $3,500 first prizes on the Prairie
Tour and picked up $7,500 for winning the Nebraska Open.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the PGA Tour qualifying tournament in November,
Gotsche tied for 134th, which made him a nonexempt player. Players
with this conditional status have to sit by the telephone sometimes
and wait until Monday or Tuesday to hear if they are in a
tournament. Then they rush to the airport, which can be a 100-mile
drive for Gotsche.
</P>
<P>
   He took care of that problem in March by winning the Monterrey
Open. Then he won the Upstate Classic in Greenville, S.C., on May
2.

U.S. BACKS BRITISH-DUTCH PLAN TO PARTIALLY LIFT IRAQ SANCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The United States has decided to support a
British and Dutch proposal that would partially lift oil sanctions
on Iraq if Baghdad answers outstanding questions about its
unconventional weapons programs and cooperates fully with a new
group of U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is the latest effort by the 15-member Security
Council to end the diplomatic deadlock that has prevailed since
U.S. and British planes struck Iraq last December to punish Baghdad
for its lack of cooperation with arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. inspectors have not been permitted to return since
then, leaving Council members increasingly concerned that Iraq may
again be trying to acquire unconventional weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The new proposal would create a new inspection agency for Iraq
to insure that Baghdad is complying with its commitment to forswear
unconventional weapons and that it answers outstanding questions
about its past nuclear, biological and chemical weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   Only if Iraq cooperates would the oil embargo imposed after it
invaded Kuwait in 1990 be partially suspended, the proposal states.
Specifically, it would suspend sanctions on exports, but not
imports. Russia, China and France, by contrast, favor a total
lifting of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the British-Dutch proposal would maintain ``effective
financial controls'' on Iraqi revenues to insure that Iraq does not
use the revenue to buy or make unconventional weapons. This means
that the United Nations would still maintain an escrow account into
which oil companies would pay for Iraqi oil.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the suspension would require Security Council approval
every four months, which means that the United States could always
veto the suspension if it concludes that Baghdad is cheating on its
disarmament and other commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Council already permits Iraq to sell $5.26 billion
worth of oil every six months _ currently more oil than it produces
_ several diplomats dismissed the importance of the new proposal.
But that revenue can only buy food and medicine under Council
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some diplomats called it significant that both the United
States and Britain had for the first time endorsed a proposal
partially suspending oil sanctions. A. Peter Burleigh, the U.S.
representative at the United Nations, said that although Washington
still had ``some problems with some parts'' of the proposal, ``it
is something the U.S. can support.''
</P>
<P>
   The British draft, he said, would permit foreign companies to
invest in expanding Iraq's oil infrastructure and permit unlimited
exports if Iraq disarms and cooperates with inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The British and Dutch draft presents what one British diplomat
called a ``stepping stone'' approach by which Baghdad, if it
disarms, can eventually escape the sanctions regime. ``It's a road
map for the future,'' a U.S. diplomat agreed.

 &HT;    Near misses make Lehman more patient
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ Maybe Tom Lehman should do everything he can
to avoid a spot in the final pairing for the fourth round of the
U.S. Open on Sunday. After four consecutive years in the final
group and four disappointments in a row, maybe it's time for a
change of scenery, somewhere in the pack.
</P>
<P>
   But you'll never get a negative approach from Lehman, no matter
how many times he's been thwarted in his attempt to win the coveted
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the glass pretty much half-full,'' Lehman said Wednesday
during final preparations for today's first round at Pinehurst No.
2. ``I think it's been disappointing at times, but it's been a lot
of awfully good golf played as well. I've learned some lessons, and
hopefully this year I can put those in good use.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman finished third at Shinnecock in 1995 after a great
finishing performance by Corey Pavin, the winner. He bogeyed the
final hole in 1996 at Oakland Hills after his drive at the 18th
hole took a bad bounce into a fairway bunker. In 1997 at
Congressional, he hit into the water with his approach to the 71st
hole. Last year at the Olympic Club, Lehman made nothing happen in
a closing 75.
</P>
<P>
   ``What have I learned?'' Lehman said. ``Patience and learning to
hit away from the pins when you really want to go at them. . . . l
tended to get very aggressive, especially as I had the taste of
winning. I put myself in good spots, and then I just got too
aggressive and beat myself. The whole secret for the U.S. Open is
not beating yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman should take full advantage of the reduced rough at
Pinehurst No. 2 and plans to use driver as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get too greedy, but you do need to be aggressive off
the tee,'' he said. ``Even though being in the fairway is
important, you do need to give yourself some shorter irons to put
yourself in the right spots on the greens. You're not going to do
too well laying up with 1-irons all day long.''
</P>
<P>
   Different kind of pitch
</P>
<P>
   David Duval's right hand, which has healed from burns suffered
last week on a teapot, will be tested again next week. He'll throw
out the first ball in New York at the Mets-Marlins game on Tuesday.
. . . Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal of Spain was asked:
``What is your greater asset, your head or your heart?'' Olazabal
replied: ``My nose. Look at it.'' . . . One of the Pinehurst's
oldest traditions is for guests at the Pinecrest Inn to chip balls
into the fireplace through a small opening. Davis Love III, who is
staying there this week, was asked how much money he has won there
during the years on bets near the bar. ``I don't think I ever won
anything,'' he said, ``because I couldn't chip in college.''
</P>
<P>
   . . . Of his role as a sort of hometown favorite, Love, a former
University of North Carolina student and Georgia native, said, ``If
I listen and read very much more, I'll think that I've lived
here.''

CLINTON PUSHES FOR TREATY TO BAN WORST CHILD LABOR PRACTICES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany, France, Britain, Myanmar)   By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Appealing for a ``human face'' on the global economy,
President Clinton urged the International Labor Organization on
Wednesday to adopt a treaty that would ban the most abusive child
labor practices, including the use of children in pornography and
prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   The speech to the 174-member organization, Clinton's first
appearance of his six-day European trip, underlined the
administration's insistence that free trade does not have to mean
increased abuse of impoverished workers in developing countries. In
short, the administration argues that the global economy can be
both ``free and fair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As we press for more open trade, we must do more to insure
that all our people are lifted by the global economy,'' Clinton
said before delegates of the labor organization gathered for their
annual conference at the U.N. building here.
</P>
<P>
   Among the conditions that the new treaty would outlaw are work
dealing with toxic substances, and labor that is deemed harmful to
children's health, safety or morals.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton declared his support for the treaty after a compromise
was reached on the recruitment of people under 18 year old into the
military. The United States and Britain recruit 17-year-old
volunteers. The treaty's final draft would now prohibit forced
recruitment of children for use in armed conflict'' but allow
voluntary enlistment.
</P>
<P>
   In another compromise, the treaty does not include in its list
of ``worst forms'' of child labor, work that deprives children of
education, a goal that some developing countries said was
unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton used as a success story a program in Pakistan where
the labor organization and the U.N. International Children's
Education Fund joined forces to remove children under 14 from
soccer ball production and replaced them with women needing the
work. The children then were given a chance to attend school,
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   As a worst case, Clinton singled out Myanmar, formerly Burma,
where, he said, the labor organization just reported that
``flagrant violation of human rights persists, and I urge the ILO
governing body to take definite steps.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent report, the labor organization said 250 million
children between the ages of 5 and 14 worked, mostly in Asia and
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   To reinforce the treaty that is expected to be adopted here and
which the White House is urging the Senate to approve, Clinton
issued an executive order last weekend directing government
agencies not to buy products made by forced child labor. The order
mandates preparation of a list of countries and products that may
involve forced labor. All government agencies must then consult the
list before purchasing and contractors must certify child labor is
not involved in their products.
</P>
<P>
   The child labor treaty does not include economic sanctions
against countries that do not enforce the provisions. Instead, the
labor organization has adopted stepped-up reporting of child labor
abuses so that the policies of countries that persist in the
practices are made known.

CONTROVERSIAL VICE PRESIDENT AT COMPAQ RESIGNS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON_ Hans W. Gutsch, the controversial senior vice president
of human resources at Compaq Computer Corp., resigned from the
company Wednesday, telling board chairman Benjamin Rosen that he no
longer wanted to be a ``lightning rod.''
</P>
<P>
   Both current and former Compaq employees say Gutsch was part of
a group of senior executives dubbed the ``A team'' who controlled
access to former chief executive Eckhard Pfeiffer.
</P>
<P>
   Gutsch also was the subject of two sexual harassment-related
financial settlements paid by Compaq, as well as a 1998
investigation into other harassment allegations, detailed in a May
30 Houston Chronicle story.
</P>
<P>
   The claims that sparked the 1998 investigation were found to
have ``no basis'' after the woman who made them refused to give
names, fearing the alleged victims would lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Gutsch is the last A-team member to resign. Earl Mason, Compaq's
former chief financial officer, left when Pfeiffer was forced out
on April 18. John Rose, who headed Compaq's enterprise computing
group, resigned on June 2.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer and some sources inside Compaq deny any senior
executives were granted more access to the chief executive than
others. They say accusations that Gutsch and others sought to
divide top management were sour grapes on the part of executives
who were shut out of planning that involved the Tandem and Digital
Equipment Corp. acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   In his resignation letter addressed to Rosen, Compaq's chairman
and acting chief executive, Gutsch wrote about his accomplishments
during his 11-year tenure, but then said ``there have also been
costs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the recent changes in management, there have been
unfounded and untrue allegations made about my personal conduct and
these anonymous allegations have been conveyed into the increased
coverage in the press the Company naturally received during this
time,'' Gutsch wrote. ``Apart from personal hurt to me and mine,
these allegations are a distraction for the Company at a time it
does not need distractions. I have chosen to no longer be a
lightning rod for this.''
</P>
<P>
   No replacement for Gutsch was named. His human resources group _
which also oversees Compaq's environmental, facilities and security
operations _ will report directly to the three-person office of the
chief executive, which consists of Rosen and board members Robert
Ted Enloe and Frank Doyle.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq officials would not comment on Gutsch's departure, and
Gutsch could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   A written statement issued Wednesday characterized Gutsch's
departure as a retirement. In it, Rosen said that Gutsch ``was
instrumental in developing Compaq's global infrastructure as the
Company grew from 2,000 to 70,000 employees.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hans managed and implemented world-class human resource and
organizational strategies, personnel development programs, and
safety, security and environmental policies,'' Rosen said in the
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the former Compaq executives who'd been publicly
critical of Gutsch would not comment on his departure.
</P>
<P>
   But Freda K. Hendricks, a former secretary to another senior
vice president who accused Gutsch of sexually harassing other women
at Compaq in a June 1998 letter to board members, said Wednesday
she was glad he had resigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been a detriment to the company for a while, and it
sends the right message now that he is gone,'' Hendricks said.
``Human resources will now be for the people instead of for
management.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutsch's resignation was announced after the market closed on
Wednesday. Compaq's stock closed at 22 1/4, up 1 1/16.

 &HT;    Pack closing on U.S. women
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The fine-toothed comb that some in the media have been
using to detect weaknesses on the U.S. Women's World Cup team might
not be coming across as the biggest reason why the Americans aren't
the overwhelming favorites for the Cup that they were a few months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the U.S. team was rocked by Norway in the 1995 World
Cup semifinals, some of its closest rivals _ as well as others
looking to move into the elite _ have been trying furiously to keep
up or get established. The Americans won the first Olympic gold
medal a year later in Athens, although it wasn't easy, as evidenced
by a grueling 2-1 semifinal win in overtime to avenge the Norwegian
loss.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is still an even favorite, along with China
and defending champion Norway, as it opens World Cup play Saturday
against Denmark at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about American vulnerability in central defense to
swift counterattacks, and the lack of a consistently creative
midfielder have grown out of some recent friendlies, including a
4-2 win over Canada on June 6 in which the U.S. team surrendered
both goals quickly.
</P>
<P>
   China also has taken advantage of those factors to beat the U.S.
team twice this year, the second to snap a 50-match home winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a good team, but we know we can't shut out every
opponent,'' U.S. coach Tony DiCicco said. ``I was really pleased
with the Canada game, because that's the kind of game that's going
to make us a better team.''
</P>
<P>
   Although only five teams are given a legitimate chance to hoist
the trophy July 10 in the Rose Bowl _ Germany and Brazil being the
other two _ the gap between them and some of the others might be
closing, if ever so slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Take Nigeria as a good example. The Super Falcons have had
little success outside their continent, and have lost all six
previous World Cup matches. But the African nation, which plays the
U.S. team June 24 in Chicago, beat China 4-3 over the weekend in an
exhibition match in Los Angeles and showed some dangerous speed and
flair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they're necessarily catching up all that much,
but they're getting more support at home,'' U.S. goalkeeper Briana
Scurry said. ``They're getting more games and more experience, and
within that are the fruits of victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Spain: Atletico avoids relegation
</P>
<P>
   After going through four coaches and enduring the maddening
whims of president Jesus Gil y Gil, Atletico Madrid clinched a spot
in the Spanish Primera Division next year with a resounding home
3-1 victory over Real Madrid on Saturday. The loss was another
serious blow for Madrid, which was still reeling from a 6-0 Spanish
Cup defeat to Valencia last week.... Here's a player whose services
shouldn't be in high demand anytime soon: Tenerife goalkeeper
Carlos Montoya, who has earned the distinction of playing for
relegated Spanish teams in each of the last three seasons. In that
span, he has given up 101 goals in 80 games, and even though he was
benched for the last six games this season, it didn't prevent
Tenerife from dropping down.
</P>
<P>
   Germany: Bremen wins Cup
</P>
<P>
   Frank Rost stopped a shot by Lothar Matthaus as Werder Bremen
won the penalty kick round 5-4 and captured the German Cup on
Saturday in a 2-1 upset of Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich. The
loss came after Bayern's shocking loss to Manchester United in the
European Cup finals, but it was a big boost for Bremen, which
finished in the bottom half of the league.
</P>
<P>
   Italy: Explosive hurts keeper
</P>
<P>
   Italian fans are notorious for tossing sparklers onto the field
during play, and on Sunday it was responsible for injuring a
third-division goalkeeper during the final game of the season.
Marco Borghetto of Serie C club Lumezanne fell to the ground when
the explosive landed near him in a 2-1 loss to Pistola. He was
taken to a hospital for treatment, but information about his
condition has not been released. Brazil: Edmundo, Romario left off
</P>
<P>
   Brazil coach Wanderley Luxemburgo, saying he wants a unified
team defend the Copa America crown later this summer, is keeping
volatile strikers Edmundo and Romario at home. Romario, who didn't
play in the World Cup last year, is the top scorer in the Rio de
Janeiro state championship for Palmeiras, while Edmundo has been
playing well since rejoining Vasco de Gama last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The verb must always be conjugated in the first person plural
_ `we do, we play,''' Luxemburgo said, referring to no player in
particular. ``The word `I' in a group gets complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the usual suspects were chosen, including Ronaldo,
Roberto Carlos, Cafu, Cesar Sampaio, Rivaldo, Ze Roberto, Leonardo
and Flavio Conceicao.
</P>
<P>
   Amoroso signs for $42.3 million
</P>
<P>
   After Christian Vieri's record transfer from Lazio to Inter
Milan last week for $50 million, another Italian club opened up a
generous checkbook to land Serie A's top goal-scorer. Parma's $42.3
million sum has attracted Brazilian Marcio Amoroso, coming off a
22-goal season at Udinese. But he won't be aided by one of the best
midfielders in the league, as Argentine Juan Veron has left Parma
to join Lazio.... Liverpool paid an English goalkeeping record of
$6.4 million to lure Dutchman Sander Westerveld away from Vitesse
Arnhem. He is the seventh player, and seventh foreigner, signed by
French manager Gerard Houllier, who welcomed back embattled striker
Robbie Fowler with a contract extension.... Brian Laudruphas
returned to Ajax Amsterdam.

BEAR STEARNS SUIT BY SEC SAID TO BE NEAR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Settlement talks have broken down between the
Securities and Exchange Commission and Bear Stearns Co. concerning
the firm's activities as a clearing agent for small brokerage firms
that defrauded investors, according to people close to the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Most SEC cases involving brokerage firms are settled before they
reach a courtroom. But unless Bear Stearns offers to settle the
case quickly, the people close to the investigation said, the SEC
is preparing to sue the firm within days.
</P>
<P>
   Though the details are still being worked out, a person close to
the investigation said that the SEC case would most likely accuse
Bear Stearns of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Bear Stearns said that discussions were
continuing. A spokeswoman for the SEC declined to comment on the
status of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Bear Stearns Clearing Corp., the firm's unit that clears trades
and provides capital and administrative services to smaller firms
nationwide, has been the subject of an SEC investigation since 1997
after the failure of A.R. Baron &AMP; Co., a brokerage firm in New York
that cleared its trades through Bear Stearns. Bear Stearns and the
SEC have been in settlement talks for more than two months.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the SEC inquiry, Bear Stearns is under
investigation by Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan district
attorney, who won 13 securities fraud convictions against A.R.
Baron's executives and brokers in 1997 and 1998. Morgenthau is
investigating Bear Stearns' role in the A.R. Baron failure, in
which investors lost $75 million.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's Manhattan office are also
investigating Bear Stearns as part of their criminal case against
Sterling Foster, a small brokerage firm that cleared its trades
through Bear Stearns. Federal prosecutors contend that Sterling
Foster executives manipulated several small stocks that their firm
underwrote and that the firm, which failed in 1997, was secretly
controlled by Randolph Pace, a former brokerage executive who had
been barred from the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who lost money with A.R. Baron say that Bear Stearns
should have known that the smaller firm was committing securities
fraud and should have acted to prevent it. Bear Stearns has
maintained that the brokerage firms dealing with the customers
directly, not the clearing firm, must police the operations for
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The A.R. Baron case has caused changes in the way securities
regulators regard clearing firms. In early June, the SEC announced
new, slightly more stringent rules for clearing firms that are
intended to help fight fraud at the kind of small brokerage firms
that have caused problems.
</P>
<P>
   Bear Stearns may yet agree to a settlement, of course. The firm
could also settle after the SEC has filed suit.
</P>
<P>
   But if no settlement is reached, regulators have a couple of
options. They could bring an administrative law proceeding _ a
trial heard by an SEC administrative law judge who issues a
decision and can censure the firm, levy fines, suspend it or bar it
from the business. Bear Stearns could appeal any ruling to the full
commission. Administrative law proceedings can take months or years
to complete.
</P>
<P>
   Or the SEC could go into federal court and ask a judge for an
injunction against the firm and seek restitution and penalties.
This is viewed as somewhat more severe than an administrative
proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Most firms avoid all this by settling with the SEC, but
securities lawyers offered several reasons why Bear Stearns might
not want to settle. If the firm cannot also bring the district
attorney and federal prosecutors into the deal _ what is known as a
global settlement _ it may fear that information contained in an
SEC settlement could be used as evidence against it in criminal
investigations. Fighting the SEC before its own judge or in federal
court would not create such a problem because a lawsuit contains
only allegations until a judge rules, which can be many months or
years.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a settlement with the SEC could make Bear Stearns more
vulnerable in pending civil litigation related to its clearing
operations. A deal could hurt the firm's relationships with its
lenders and customers and invite actions from state securities
regulators. Even though the firm presumably would neither admit nor
deny any allegations in a settlement with the SEC, a jury or
arbitration panel in a civil proceeding might give it considerable
weight, tantamount to an admission of guilt.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC could also charge the firm with aiding and abetting
fraud, a charge that cannot be leveled against the firm in federal
civil lawsuits. In 1995, the Supreme Court ruled that private
actions could no longer be brought against, say, an accounting firm
or law firm for aiding and abetting a violations of securities
laws. But as part of the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995,
Congress stated that the SEC could bring such cases against
ancillary parties to a violation.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what effect an SEC suit might have on the pending
criminal investigations, both Morgenthau and a spokesman for the
U.S. attorney's Manhattan office declined to comment. &QL;

 &HT;    U.S. takes Argentina win in stride
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Let's hear it for the boys.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. men's national team stole some thunder before the start
of the Women's World Cup by stunning Argentina 1-0 Sunday in a
friendly. Perhaps the most encouraging sign was how calmly the
American camp reacted to the feat.
</P>
<P>
   An 88th-minute goal by Joe-Max Moore provided the only scoring
as the U.S. team won its third match against a substantial opponent
since coach Bruce Arena came on board last fall, but he's not
letting anybody take it out of proportion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still a year away from becoming a pretty good national
team,'' Arena said. ``It's a good win, but we're not going to make
too much of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But it certainly figures to add confidence for the Americans as
they prepare for the Confederations Cup in July, with Brazil and
Germany in their pool.
</P>
<P>
   Under siege most of the afternoon by Inter Milan's fleet left
back Javier Zanetti, the makeshift U.S. defense held up relatively
well. Eddie Pope and Carlos Llamosa are out with injuries, but C.J.
Brown's only mistake was a sliding tackle that yielded a penalty
kick stopped by Kasey Keller.
</P>
<P>
   Claudio Reyna had good game as the creative force in midfield,
and the U.S. attack was without injured forward Brian McBride. The
match also gave Arena a chance to continue evaluating a pool of
players he hopes will be up for a much tougher slate next year.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team will give Argentina a rematch in Buenos Aires and
could figure as a tune-up opponent for several qualifiers of the
European championships.
</P>
<P>
   MLS: Hermosillo pays dividends
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Galaxy has the league's worst offense, and home
attendance at the Rose Bowl has fallen under 10,000 for some games.
But Mexican League star Carlos Hermosillo proved an instant tonic.
In his first MLS game this season, he scored to lead the Galaxy to
a 2-1 win over the defending MLS champions Chicago Fire. His return
attracted more than 18,000.... The Fire has lost three in a row and
five of six.... D.C. United, playing without several injured and
U.S. national team players, beat Columbus 3-1 on the road Sunday
for its seventh straight win.

WITH LITTLE DATA ON SUCCESS, MANDATORY SUMMER SCHOOL EXPANDS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Ill., Wash., Calif., Wis., Md., D.C.)   (nk) 
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beginning its second year of expanded summer school, muggy
Washington bought fans and bottled water when it realized it could
not install air-conditioning in all its buildings. Boston has
struggled to find transportation for its summer school students,
because not all will attend their neighborhood schools. Los Angeles
is deflecting criticism from teachers that summer school classes
will be too large and the curriculum too vague.
</P>
<P>
   As New York City gears up for the nation's largest mandatory
summer school program _ starting with 70,000 students next month
and growing to as many as 362,000 next year _ the experience in
these cities shows that the logistical hurdles will be formidable.
</P>
<P>
   What it does not show conclusively is whether mandatory summer
school works.
</P>
<P>
   The nationwide rush to summer school, in urban districts from
Los Angeles to Boston to Hartford to Denver, is part of a widening
crackdown on social promotion, the practice of allowing failing
students to move on to the next grade. Summer school is seen as a
major ingredient _ popular among parents and teachers alike _
because studies show that holding children back does little good
unless they get extensive tutoring over the summer and afterward.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a vacuum of comprehensive research showing how well
summer school works, how it should be approached and how it
compares with other programs aimed at raising achievement, like
after-school tutoring or smaller class sizes.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, which banned social promotion in several grades three
years ago, is furthest along, with 27,000 to 30,000 students
expected in mandatory summer school in the coming weeks. It has
reported some promising signs, in the form of rising test scores.
But even there, researchers say, summer school has not been in
place long enough to draw conclusive results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, some pupils have made progress,'' said Michael Klonsky,
a professor of education at the University of Illinois at Chicago
who specializes in school reform. ``But this is still a mixed bag.
You're doing things to make them give up their summer, teaching
what is basically a `kill and drill' curriculum. It is geared only
toward scoring better on tests.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City's move to mandatory summer school, which could
involve about a third of its 1.1 million students, will dwarf any
comparable program elsewhere _ not just because New York has the
nation's largest school system, but also because it will involve so
many grades, from three to 12.
</P>
<P>
   Most such programs have expanded gradually; New York plans to go
from a voluntary summer program with about 200,000 students _
including nearly 70,000 in grades three, six and eight ordered
there under the threat of being held back _ to a mandatory one. The
total number of students could nearly double next year, because of
more grades and stricter standards.
</P>
<P>
   School officials said they still hoped to be able to accommodate
voluntary students, who are often strongly encouraged by teachers
to attend but who will not be held back if they decline.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators will focus on the lowest performers on state and
city tests and also look at class work and attendance. The students
will have to pass a test at the end of the summer to move up.
</P>
<P>
   The real test will come next year. Officials expect the same
number of students in summer school this year as last, when a
record 200,000 attended; the only difference is that the 70,000 or
so ordered there will be the first to be admitted.
</P>
<P>
   For next year, New York has begun planning to resolve a host of
logistical problems, like finding enough high-quality teachers and
suitable buildings, preferably close to students' homes _ though
Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew says not all students will be
attending their neighborhood schools. Many buildings close over the
summer for renovation, and only about a fifth of the classrooms
have air-conditioning, which is not seen as a luxury when trying to
keep children focused and teachers interested in giving up vacation
time.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While many details remain to be worked out, the demand for new
teachers will be high. Board officials have said that as many as
362,000 students may end up in summer school, but they are hoping
that tutoring and coaching during the regular school year will
reduce the number, to 300,000 or even less.
</P>
<P>
   With the goal, at this point, of having class sizes of 15 or so
but possibly up to 20, board officials are planning on using 18,000
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers' union officials say they do not know where all of them
will come from, since virtually every teacher who wants to work
this year is doing so, and that still only adds up to 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential problem is that teachers are paid less to
teach summer school than they are paid during the school year.
Susan Amlung, a spokeswoman for the teachers' union, the United
Federation of Teachers, said the board was locked into the $32 per
hour summer rate by a contract not due to expire until November
2000, but she said the union would seek ways to sweeten the job,
such as allowing teachers to accumulate pension credit for summer
work, something not currently allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Board officials say next year's program will cost $175 million
above the $60 million to $70 million normally budgeted for summer
school, not counting money for air-conditioning, which could add
several million more. Crew says that he is determined to find the
financing for the program and that he will look into using
buildings ``in places we might otherwise may not have considered,''
including community colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Board officials have said they plan to enlist retirees to
forestall teacher shortages and may hunt in districts outside the
city.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Through a spokeswoman, the chancellor has demurred at Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani's suggestion to contract with private and
parochial schools to handle some of the instruction.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a common practice, judging from a spot-check of large
school systems.
</P>
<P>
   In Milwaukee, which is entering its second year of voluntary
summer school, all such instruction is done in public schools,
though the superintendent and the Roman Catholic archdiocese last
week agreed to develop and share after-school programs.
</P>
<P>
   Logistical problems are to be expected, educators say, as school
administrators grasp at concepts new to them, with few models to go
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you go into something like this, you are going to
have a rocky first year,'' said John Perez, a vice president with
United Teachers Los Angeles, the teacher's union, which supports
the concept of summer school and ending social promotion.
``Teachers welcome it in theory; let's see how it works out.''
</P>
<P>
   Class sizes in the Los Angeles program, financed with $71
million from the state, which is mandating the end of social
promotion, will be about 20 this year, a tad higher than the
average 15 to 18 in most programs.
</P>
<P>
   Most cities look to Chicago, which has had three years to work
out the kinks, as their example.
</P>
<P>
   It is credited with pioneering the idea of mass remediation by
way of summer school as way to raise student achievement _ as
judged largely on standardized tests _ and to avoid having droves
of students left back under a tough new policy intended to end the
automatic promotion of students to the next grade.
</P>
<P>
   The summer classes are typically half-day and half the size of
those in the regular school year; the curriculum is a no-nonsense
drill in basic reading and math, with little or no recess.
</P>
<P>
   Not all cities are sold on summer school. Last year, Seattle
experimented with an ``academic boot camp'' intended to lift the
performance of 200 fifth-graders. In the end, only a few had done
well enough to move on to the next grade, and Sharon Green, the
district's chief academic officer, said such a hard-line summer
school would not be repeated this year.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, where an estimated 6,500 students in grades two, five,
six, seven and eight will attend a one-month mandatory summer
school for the first time in July, created a position last week to
oversee summer school and iron out difficulties like
transportation. The $21 million allotted for the program will not
fully cover getting students to the schools that will house summer
programs, and parents are complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were worried about whether or not it was just something
they were throwing together,'' said Hattie McKinnis, executive
director of the Citywide Parents Council. ``At this point, the
parents just did not feel that this mandatory summer school is
worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, there has not been widespread resistance to the plan by
parents or teachers in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But many have sought to insure that the summer school experience
is vastly different from that of the regular school year.
</P>
<P>
   Judith A. Rizzo, the deputy chancellor for instruction in New
York, said students will pore over reading and math to address
their shortfalls in basic skills. Those who do not pass
end-of-summer tests and are forced to repeat the grade will receive
intensive instruction so that they do not go on repeating the
grade, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, teachers will be provided individual assessments of
the 8,000 students expected in summer school this year to hone in
on their weaknesses, said Susan Sclafani, the district's chief of
staff for educational services, who notes that most of the system's
280 schools received air-conditioning in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world these children are moving into is just not the place
without good literacy and numeracy skills,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Karweit, a researcher with the Center for Research on the
Education of Students Placed at Risk, based at Johns Hopkins
University, said she was not surprised at the lack of broad study
of such programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times when interventions are planned around political
things such as standards and accountability, people don't build in
evaluations into the implementation,'' Ms. Karweit said. ``We need
to be more questioning as a society about the kinds of things we
put in place. Sometimes common sense things aren't the best.''

L.A.-AREA STARS TAKE ANOTHER SHOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Los Angeles-area golfers Chris Zambri and David Berganio Jr.
need any extra emotional boost today in their return to the U.S.
Open, they need only recall what happened the last time they played
in the national golf championship.
</P>
<P>
   Berganio _ the former Alemany High star, 1993 Pac-10 Conference
MVP at Arizona and two-time U.S. Public Links champion _ shot 69 in
the first round of the 1996 Open at Michigan's Oakland Hills
Country Club and finished 16th that year.
</P>
<P>
   Zambri, the ex-Westlake High and USC standout whose 10-under-par
61 is the course record at Thousand Oaks' Sunset Hills Country
Club, similarly found himself among the early leaders at the 1995
Open at Shinnecock Hills. His first-round 70 left him four strokes
out of first place. A second-round 81 prevented him from making the
cut, but Zambri continues to draw confidence from that opening
round, which put him ahead of eventual champion Corey Pavin.
</P>
<P>
   Zambri and Berganio, both Nike Tour performers, play in this
week's 99th Open at North Carolina's Pinehurst Resort &AMP; Country
Club, on the famed, Donald Ross-designed Pinehurst No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   They qualified last week at El Caballero Country Club in
Tarzana, Zambri taking medalist honors at 4-under-par 138 and
Berganio sharing second at 140. They also had the best two 18-hole
scores in that 36-hole qualifier, Zambri shooting 66 and Berganio
67 in the morning round at par-71, 6,830-yard El Cab.
</P>
<P>
   Both stayed sharp in last week's Nike Tour Cleveland Open, tying
for 10th with 6-under-par totals of 282. It was the second-best
score on tour this year for both. Zambri had a 12-under-par 276
while finishing 11th at the Monterrey Open, where Berganio's
15-under 273 earned him third place.
</P>
<P>
   __ Downtown Browne: Another former area golfer playing at
Pinehurst, Occidental College graduate Olin Browne, similarly can
call upon past Open success for inspiration this week.
</P>
<P>
   Browne, who ranks third in all-time Nike Tour victories with
four and has been a PGA Tour member since 1995, finished fifth in
the '97 Open at Congressional, where his 282 total was six strokes
behind champion Ernie Els.
</P>
<P>
   Browne enters this week's Open as one of the PGA Tour's hotter
players. He has won twice in less than a year _ at the Greater
Hartford Open in July and Colonial last month _ and finished third
in Jack Nicklaus' Memorial tournament two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   __ Knight, again: Helen Knight of El Caballero Country Club
improved on one of the nation's more remarkable club golf
achievements Tuesday when she won the El Cab women's championship
for a 37th time in 42 years.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, who took her first golf lesson as a University of
Michigan coed more than 50 years ago from 1927 U.S. Open and 1931
British Open champion Tommy Armour, won El Cab's first 32 women's
championships, from 1957-89. She won again in '91 and launched her
current four-year title streak in '96.
</P>
<P>
   This year, she held off a field of nearly three dozen, finishing
with a four-round total of 351 to win by four strokes over
runner-up Lynn Edelson, who was tied with Knight entering the final
round.
</P>
<P>
   __ Back to the Bruins: Cal State Northridge women's golf coach
Carrie Leary, who helped UCLA win the NCAA women's golf
championship in 1991, will return to her alma mater as head coach
this fall. She was selected Friday to replace Jackie
Tobian-Steinmann, who coached Leary at UCLA and will retire June 30
after coaching the Bruins for 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   Leary, who started the Northridge women's golf program three
years ago, produced two All-Big Sky Conference players (Cheryl
Musser and Kelley Carlson) and directed the Matadors to a
third-place finish in this year's conference championship.
</P>
<P>
   __ Tiger topped twice: How fast is high school golf improving?
Two of Tiger Woods' championship records were surpassed in as many
tournaments at the end of this year's Southern Section season.
</P>
<P>
   First, University (Irvine) junior Brian Sinay shot 7-under-par
65 to win the section final at Palm Springs' Canyon Country Club.
Then, Stanford-bound senior Ron Won, also from University, shot
6-under-par 66 in winning the CIF/SCGA championship at SCGA
Members' Club last week. Woods had set both records in 1991 while
competing for Western (Anaheim) High.
</P>
<P>
   __ Looking ahead: Royal High (Simi Valley) junior Roy Moon, who
placed fifth in the Southern Section final and second in the
CIF/SCGA championship _ shooting 3-under-par 69 in both events _ is
the early favorite to become the area's top golfer next season.
</P>
<P>
   Moon shot eight sub-par rounds in his final 12 high school
competitions this season. His closing charge lowered his own
school-record season scoring average and dethroned two-time
defending Marmonte League J.T. Kohut, bound for UCLA on a full golf
scholarship.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By the end of Rep. Tom DeLay's pulpit-thumping,
brimstone-seething exhortation against gun controls and the moral
decay of ``liberal relativism,'' the evangelical clergymen
assembled in the morning sunshine bathing the Capitol were moved to
rounds of ``Hallelujah!'' and ``Amen Jesus!'' ``Reverend DeLay!''
boomed one minister, waving the Bible before a clot of television
cameras on the Capitol lawn.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the Reverend Whip'' was more like it for the sulfurous
tinge DeLay lent to the long, miasmic debating day that essentially
broke the complex issue of school shootings into two disparate
areas for blame-saying: the entertainment industry's purveying of
melodramatized violence and easy access to guns.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, a pugnacious Texan ever joyous in battle, was all over
the debate in his role as House majority whip and as one of the few
relentlessly dynamic members lately to be seen among the troubled
Republican hierarchy. He was only warming up before the clergymen,
clearing his political preacher's pipes as he denounced the
American culture ``that worships the self and the moment'' and
skewered the ``liberal relativism that has hollowed out the souls
of so many.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's truly big speech, steeped in old-time religion and moral
alarms to the citizenry about everything from evolution to
contraception, from day care to abortion, was to come an hour later
on the floor of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Even opposition Democrats who privately savor DeLay's trademark
political zeal had to look up and listen in wonder as he raged
point blank against modern life and belittled the argument that the
convenient availability of guns was the prime factor in the school
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Glowering, at times fulminating as he put society at large in
the dock, DeLay thoroughly embraced as his own some views what he
said were first penned by a Texan writing a letter to the editor:
``We have sterilized and contracepted our families down to sizes so
small that the children we do have are so spoiled with material
things that they come to equate the receiving of the material with
love.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, anticipating the gun issue as a profitable but
limited agenda item in the elections next year, suddenly were
hearing DeLay sound Joshua's trumpet to a full-scale cultural war
that mainstream Republican presidential candidates like Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas have been shying from.
</P>
<P>
   ``We place our children in day care centers where they learn
their socialization skills among their peers under the law of the
jungle,'' DeLay grumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating ``It could not have been because ...'' as a sardonic
oratorical device, DeLay's causal list for school shootings
featured the argument that ``our school systems teach the children
that they are nothing but glorified apes who are evolutionized out
of some primordial soup of mud.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We teach our children that there are no laws of morality that
transcend us,'' he continued, ``that everything is relative and
that actions don't have consequence _ what the heck, the president
gets away with it.'' Dripping sarcasm, he concluded, ``No, it must
have been the guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the aisle, Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., rose in rather
delighted opposition to observe wide-eyed, ``I know we've had a lot
of discussion of what was causing the problems here but I just
heard the majority whip say it was Charles Darwin's fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Four blocks from the debate, James J. Baker, the chief lobbyist
for the National Rifle Association, coolly monitored the
preliminary cultural fray as he marshaled a team of a half-dozen
lobbyists on Capitol Hill for the showdown votes on guns, expected
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hopping around here,'' he said in a quiet office bunker
above Bullfeathers restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very fluid,'' Baker said as the Republican leadership
flooded the stage with dozens of culture debate proposals and kept
the gun issue waiting in the wings. ``There are all these curve
balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Morning speakers did not wait for the formal opening of the gun
debate as they went after the issue in pro forma one-minute
speeches offered for television markets back home. ``Guns are a
two-edged sword,'' advised one lawmaker. ``Kids, you've seen the
poster!'' another shouted mockingly of the proposal to display the
Ten Commandments in schools. ``Now see the movie star Charlton
Heston, president of the NRA, in a law with loopholes wider than
his parting of the Red Sea!''
</P>
<P>
   In the cultural debate, Democrats and a few Republicans attacked
as clumsy and unconstitutional proposals to try to outlaw
depictions of violence for minors. Proposed definitions of
``mutilation'' and ``flagellation'' in the bill were criticized as
bizarre utterances that should not be debated until after the
children were in bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there's nothing in this about spraying 100 people with an
assault weapon,'' exclaimed Howard L. Berman, a California
Democrat, studying the proposal for a reference to the heart of the
matter, the schoolhouse assaults, as the cultural debate wended
into the night.
</P>
<P>
   At each skirmish, DeLay maintained that guns were hardly the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberals demagogue tragedies like school shootings to push a
left-wing agenda,'' he contended, braced for the House debate by a
fresh round of ``Amen!'' and ``Praise Jesus!''

 &HT;    Players ready to pitch, putt
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ The U.S. Open usually requires a player to be
part blacksmith and part diamond-cutter. In a typical U.S. Golf
Association setup, strength is required to move the ball from
ankle-deep rough. An equal amount of touch is required to hold and
then putt on devilishly fast greens.
</P>
<P>
   This year, things are different. The man who wins the 1999 U.S.
Open will be the most creative.
</P>
<P>
   In order to win this year's Open at Pinehurst No. 2, golfers
must get the ball up and down from the shaved, sloped areas around
the greens. The greens in Donald Ross' design resemble upside-down
saucers.
</P>
<P>
   Players will use everything to solve the short-game puzzle. Some
will putt from everywhere, adhering to the age-old axiom that a
rotten putt usually beats a bad chip. Some will brandish 3-woods to
make the ball ride above the grass and over the mounds. Some will
pitch into the banks and trickle the ball onto the green.
</P>
<P>
   The occasional daredevil such as Phil Mickelson will even slide
a lob wedge or two underneath the tight bentgrass.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson, Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal, Tiger Woods,
Davis Love III, Payne Stewart, Justin Leonard and Ernie Els should
figure prominently because of the creativity in their short games.
</P>
<P>
   In practice this week, players have experimented at every
opportunity. Ireland's Darren Clarke spent time Wednesday at the
18th green, scooting balls up the steep slope behind the putting
surface with a fairway wood. Woods put in as much time at the
practice areas as he did on the course.
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal has worked with every club from a 7-iron to sand wedge.
With two Masters titles, he does not mind Augustalike demands
around the greens; it's better than the high rough of past U.S.
Opens.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had 5 inches of rough on this golf course and 20-yard
fairways,'' Olazabal said, ``I think Tuesday and Wednesday next
week, we still will be playing golf here.''
</P>
<P>
   The grass used to be spottier at No. 2 when Love III played the
course while in college. Now, the putting surfaces, which were
changed to G-2 bentgrass a few years ago, roll true.
</P>
<P>
   ``The putter is my safest shot, the one I feel more comfortable
with,'' Love said. ``Or if it rolls way down the hill into the
short cut, I've been putting it up with a 3-wood, something I
haven't done much of in the past. . . . The grass is so good and so
tight I don't think I'm going to have much success pitching it.''
</P>
<P>
   David Duval doesn't use his 3-wood, but when he isn't putting
he'll use a 2- or 3-iron to get above the grass. He also will
consider chipping the ball into the slopes ``and letting it kill it
and bounce it up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every player is going to miss the green,'' Duval said, ``so
you're going to have to be creative and hit a lot of shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods enjoys the creativity needed to get up and down from
around the greens. He likes coming up with new methods and always
has been excited about links golf in Europe, where the ball spends
more time on the ground. When Woods faces a chip up a slope that
runs into the grain, he probably will not chip the ball to avoid a
chance of ``stubbing it.'' He will use his putter or 3-wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``This golf course from tee to green is very simple,'' he said.
``It's around the green where it becomes complicated.''

U.S. AND RUSSIAN DEFENSE CHIEFS CITE PROGRESS ON KOSOVO TROOPS
ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELSINKI, Finland _ After seven hours of intense talks, Defense
Secretary William Cohen and his Russian counterpart, Marshal Igor
Sergeyev, said Wednesday night that they had made progress toward a
resolution of the touchy issue of Russia's role in the Kosovo
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   But neither side was ready to predict with certainty that a
final agreement would be ready Thursday, when Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov join the
marathon negotiations being held in the Presidential Palace here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we will conclude by tomorrow, but it may take
longer,'' Cohen said at a news briefing late Wednesday night, where
he noted that a number of details were still to be hammered out.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators are under pressure to come up with an agreement by
the weekend, when President Clinton meets President Boris Yeltsin
in Cologne, Germany. Cohen is also due to report on the talks to
the North Atlantic Council in Brussels on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he had been on the phone Wednesday with with NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana, Gen. Wesley Clark, the alliance's
commander, and U.S. military officials, informing them of the
progress of the talks. Some NATO officials had earlier expressed
concern that NATO was not being represented at the U.S.-Russian
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   With Russian paratroopers already on the ground at the airport
in Pristina, the Kosovo capital, the issue of Russia's role has
taken on urgency. In a sudden move that confounded and angered its
Western partners, Russia last weekend speeded up the arrival of its
troops in Kosovo, beating NATO-led forces to the Pristina airfield.
</P>
<P>
   Having presented their U.S. negotiators with a fait accompli,
the Russians are now eager to come up with an agreement. Without an
agreement, countries bordering Yugoslavia _ Hungary, Bulgaria and
Romania _ have said they will not grant air rights to Russian troop
planes. And without more troops, the Russian paratroopers now in
Kosovo are left in an ambiguous and potentially dangerous position
with no clear-cut relationship to the NATO forces around them.
</P>
<P>
   The issues discussed Wednesday by the U.S. and military
delegations _ each with about a dozen members _ included areas of
operations for the Russian troops, their command structure and the
status of the Russians stationed in Pristina, Cohen said Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   He said some issues were closer to a resolution than others _ a
view echoed by Sergeyev, speaking to reporters as he left the
Presidential Palace. But neither would be specific.
</P>
<P>
   Although Russia agreed early in the Kosovo negotiations to take
part in a peacekeeping force, it has consistently opposed sending
its troops to the region under NATO command. For its part, NATO has
insisted that the international force serve under a ``unified
command,'' and has rebuffed Russian proposals for a separate
command structure.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has also opposed suggestions of a Russian-controlled sector
in Kosovo, fearing that it would lead to a de facto partition of
the province. But in the last week, the U.S. position seems to have
softened somewhat, with new proposals for ``areas of
responsibility'' reserved for the Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere in the talks Wednesday was described by Cohen as
``businesslike but quite cordial,'' an improvement over the
tensions that dominated the negotiations in Moscow last week
between Ivanov, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and
military officials. During those talks, Russian officials, speaking
anonymously, criticized the Americans for what they called a rigid
and unconstructive approach that was disdainful of Russian
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arriving in Helsinki on Wednesday, Sergeyev said he had
received clear instructions from Yeltsin to come up with a way for
Russia to join the peacekeeping force. ``I received Yeltsin's
specific instructions,'' he said, noting that the peacekeeping
operation in Kosovo is of ``unprecedented complexity, and it can be
implemented only jointly.''

 &HT;    Smoltz rejoins team, reports his elbow is fine
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ John Smoltz rejoined the Braves on Wednesday
afternoon, saying he stayed behind in Atlanta to take care of
personal business and to visit team orthopedist Dr. Joe Chandler,
who checked his elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, who examined Smoltz's elbow after his first start
since coming off the disabled list on June 1, had been out of town
until Tuesday night when Smoltz went to his house for an informal
exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see Joe all the time,'' Smoltz said. ``He said everything
was fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz said he is set to make his next start as scheduled on
Friday night in Arizona against the Diamondbacks. He gave up seven
runs in only 2 1/3 innings in his last start Sunday against the
Orioles but has said his elbow was not a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga's prognosis
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga is scheduled to begin 2-3 weeks of radiation
treatment now that his chemotherapy is over, said his Atlanta
teammate Ozzie Guillen, who talks to Galarraga regularly. Guillen
said Galarraga is planning to rejoin the Braves, but not play, in
August for the duration of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga has not been cleared to work out because he has to
give his bones time to heal, Guillen said.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga recently visited doctors in Chicago and got good news
about his treatment for the lymphoma in a bone in his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 98 percent gone,'' Guillen said. ``That's great news.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's hit
</P>
<P>
   Brian Hunter's game-winning hit on Tuesday night was important
in several ways. Not only did it drive in Otis Nixon for the
winning run but it was Hunter's first at-bat against a right-hander
since getting hit in the face with a Roberto Hernandez fastball
last Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about it before I went to the plate,'' said Hunter,
who walked off with nothing more than a bruised upper lip after
being hit. ``Once I got to the plate I thought about getting a hit.
Now I need to see a pitch that's up and in, so I can get everything
back intact, test my reflexes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter admittedly crowds the plate, something he said he's
prepared to do because ``You don't worry about getting hit in the
body,'' he said. ``You can take body shots, but face shots? That's
scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Giving away doesn't pay
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Odalis Perez was fined $360 by the Braves on Wednesday
for throwing dozens of batting practice balls he caught in the
outfield to fans in the crowd. The Braves decided to crack down
after losing a bag and a half of balls during the batting practice
in an April trip to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   All-Star Futures
</P>
<P>
   Braves minor leaguers Bruce Chen and Rafael Furcal have been
chosen to play in the All-Star Futures game July 11, which is part
of the festivities leading up to the major league All-Star Game on
July 13 in Boston. The game pits top American minor-league
prospects against their counterparts from foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   Furcal, the Class A Macon Braves shortstop from the Dominican
Republic, and Chen the AAA Richmond starter, will play for the
``World'' team. Chen is 5-3 for Richmond with a 3.52 ERA. Furcal
leads all minor leaguers with 57 stolen bases and is hitting .328
in the South Atlantic League.

HALIBUT WOW THESE AREA ANGLERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talk about fattie flatties. Two regional California halibut
catches in the past week-and-a-half are pending world records.
</P>
<P>
   Will Akins of Grover Beach became understandably green _ with
envy, that is _ when a 32-pound flatfish hit the deck June 6 aboard
the Seahawk LXV out of Santa Barbara during a limited-load trip to
Santa Rosa Island. The steaks, err, stakes would soon get heavier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then a 47-pounder came aboard, and I got jealous,'' said
Akins, 26. Tired of rockfishing, he was taking a day off from
skippering the Harbor Pathfinder, another party boat, out of Morro
Bay. ``I wanted one of THOSE halibut.''
</P>
<P>
   Another angler had been broken off by some behemoth on 15-pound
line. It figured to have been a bat ray. When Akins soon got hooked
up on another huge specimen on live squid and 30-pound line, he was
hoping against hope it wasn't another ray. He had already hooked a
bat ray himself earlier in the day. The mystery was solved 20
minutes later when the fish came to gaff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what I had until it came up,'' Akins said.
``When it hit the deck, it was like, `Wow.' I've caught Alaska
(Pacific) halibut that big, but it's rare to see a California
halibut that big, obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, because nothing as big as the 57.6-pound Paralichthys
californicus has been recorded by the International Game Fish
Association, the Dania Beach, Fla., group that oversees such
important sport-fishing standards.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, Akins' catch will be an all-tackle record, more
than doubling his own previous heaviest California halibut. It
would eclipse the standing record of 53\ pounds, set nearly 11
years ago by Russ Harmon, proprietor of Cisco's Sportfishing in
Oxnard. Harmon is angling in Alaska _ presumably for bigger halibut
to fry _ and unavailable to comment on the expected fall of his
impressive mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I was surprised,'' the understated Akins said after the
remarkable journey produced several more flatties in the 15- to
25-pound range and a half-dozen white seabass to 45 pounds. ``You
don't think you're going to go out and catch anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, John Whalen wasn't expecting to catch a world-record
fish, either, when he took out his freshwater crappie rod and a
reel loaded with 4-pound line. Under-sized halibut, tomcod,
mackerel and calico bass were more the speed Whalen anticipated
June 9 when he went out with a friend, Stephen Sotelo, in Dana
Point Harbor on a paddle boat.
</P>
<P>
   Even when he ``got ripped'' by a fish, he thought he had hooked
into a shark and fought it leisurely . . . until he got it to the
paddle boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked down and my friend and I said, `Oh my God,' ''
recalled Whalen, of Capistrano Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The little trout net they had wasn't going to cut it on this
huge halibut. They needed a gaff. Just then a boat passed by and
the anglers asked to borrow a gaff. Luckily the passers-by had one.
</P>
<P>
   When Sotelo attempted gaffing the fish, he missed and the fish
promptly took a 100-yard run. Whalen thought it was over. But he
managed to get the flattie to the boat again.
</P>
<P>
   Sotelo smartly gave the gaff to Whalen, who, with the rod in one
hand and the gaff in the other, stuck the fish, ending the
30-minute battle.
</P>
<P>
   The 45-inch fish took up 60 percent of the paddle boat. Curious,
Whalen called his wife and asked her to look up the IGFA line-class
record for 4-pound test, which is 20 pounds, 14 ounces, hooked in
April 1991 by Scott Houghton at Santa Catalina Island.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking he had a shot, Whalen took the fish to the harbor
weighmaster. The scale read 28.6 pounds _ a record, if approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never caught a halibut over 20 pounds, so it was like,
`Wow,' '' said Whalen, who also holds the 16-pound line-class
record for black skipjack _ an 18-pound, 6-ounce specimen caught in
1989 at Mexico's Isla Cerralvo. ``I've caught a couple legal
halibut (more than 22 inches), in the harbor in the past two years,
but they're few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just being in the right place at the right time doing
the right thing.''

MARKET PLACE: WILL GREENSPAN TELL ALL ON INFLATION? 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also ECON-REPORT) 
(DW) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ian Shepherdson, the chief U.S. economist at High
Frequency Economics, is hoping for the ``Full Monty'' on Thursday
when Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, testifies
before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   For Greenspan to bare all his thoughts on the economic outlook
would be startling. Still, that is what the bond and stock markets
want after Wednesday's report that a primary gauge of inflation,
the Consumer Price Index, was unchanged in May, while the core
rate, excluding food and energy, inched up just one-tenth of 1
percent. The news scrambled investor expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Since mid-April bond investors had been doing interest rate fire
drills in preparation for the Federal Reserve's meeting of policy
makers at the end of the month. After all that practice, they had
braced for a quarter-point jump in the short-term interest rate
target.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the incredibly mild May inflation report. It made
April's jump of seven-tenths of 1 percent _ the surge that started
all the fire drills _ look like a fluke, not a trend toward
troublesome inflation.
</P>
<P>
   With that the mood shifted Wednesday in the bond market, which
can change its mind every hour, much less every day, and which
routinely overreacts. A rate increase by the Fed is still expected
this month, but no longer considered ``guaranteed.''
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, the attitude about a possible second rate
increase in August to further slow economic growth and ward off
inflation has gone from very likely to wait and see. Greenspan
could force a quick revision of that view Thursday in his testimony
about monetary policy before the Joint Economic Committee of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Shepherdson said the benign report on inflation shifted the odds
of a Fed rate increase on June 30 to 50/50 from 80/20. ``I don't
like the uncertainty,'' he said. ``I just want to know, either
way,'' if the Fed is going to sit tight or raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been easier for the markets,'' he said, ``if the
CPI number had been a big plus or a big minus'' and investors could
have been all but certain that the Fed would raise rates _ in the
case of a plus _ or leave them unchanged _ in the case of a
decline.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the inflation report was released by the Labor
Department at 8:30 a.m., the price of the 30-year bond jumped more
than a full point, while the yield, which moves in the opposite
direction, dropped to 6.02 percent, from 6.11 the previous day and
an 18-month high of 6.16 percent last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But the 30-year bond gave up half of its early gains later in
the day, with the price rising just 20/32. The yield finished at
6.06 percent. Stocks had a stronger rally.
</P>
<P>
   There is little chance for relief in the bond market until the
Fed chairman speaks. In his three most recent appearances,
Greenspan has done nothing to indicate that the bond market was
wrong to expect a rate increase this month. His silence was
followed by remarks from other members of the Fed, several
considered hawks on inflation and supportive of a rate increase,
who seemed to suggest a Fed move was a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   Shepherdson, who forecast an unchanged CPI for May and saw no
need for a rate increase now, said this silence was an indication
that Greenspan would join with the hawks. ``It's a great number,''
he said of the inflation report, ``but I am not sure it's good
enough'' to keep the Fed on hold.
</P>
<P>
   James E. Glassman, senior U.S. economist at Chase Manhattan
Bank, also expects the Fed to raise interest rates this month. But
his argument is based on the rapid pace of economic growth, rather
than on the pace of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   When Fed policy makers announced they were leaning toward a rate
increase in May, they emphasized the ``ongoing strength in demand''
in the United States and the improved foreign economic prospects,
he said. At the same time, they noted that ``trend increases in
costs and core prices have generally remained quite subdued.''
</P>
<P>
   So even though the core rate of inflation has risen just 1.8
percent this year, the fact that the economy is not showing signs
of slowing significantly still gives the Fed a reason to raise
interest rates, in Glassman's view.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Berner, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, also argues that inflation is not what will make the Fed
raise rates. He said that the Fed, as officials have signaled
recently, needs to take back some of the three, quarter-point rate
cuts it made last fall, when it moved to calm global financial
markets and to insure that the world's economy would not head into
a downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Now both Asia and Latin America show signs of a turnaround, and
global financial markets have stabilized. Overall consumer
inflation is rising toward 2.5 percent from the 1.6 percent
increase recorded last year. Given that environment, he said the
Fed's short-term interest rate target, which is now 4.75 percent,
is just too low for the present mix of inflation and economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
   All three agree that the inflation report _ if it is backed up
in the months ahead _ means that a second rate increase may not be
necessary. The recent jump in certain market barometers showed that
many investors were beginning to bet on two one-quarter rate
increases at least.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market may move quickly to a view that the Fed won't have
to move any further,'' Glassman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Shepherdson, as he thought of the Fed chairman's testimony
Thursday, said: ``It's completely in Greenspan's court. It's up to
him.''

BANK OFFICIALS INVESTIGATED IN TAX EVASION CASE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   German authorities are investigating the chief executive and
five other current and former senior executives of Deutsche Bank AG
for tax evasion, the bank said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The move raises questions about the executives' future and
complicates a recent merger that made Deutsche the world's largest
bank.
</P>
<P>
   None of the executives, including Dr. Rolf Breuer, Deutsche's
chief executive, are accused of personally evading taxes, a bank
spokesman said. Rather, the query stems from a six-year
investigation by state authorities in Germany into whether German
banks helped clients illegally shelter income to avoid taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a technical investigation that involves every big bank
in Germany,'' said Dierk Hartwig, a Deutsche Bank spokesman, in an
interview. ``We feel quite comfortable and are quite sure nothing
will go wrong with the management of Deutsche Bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the investigation could have serious implications
for Deutsche Bank and its senior executives. Similar charges
involving another large German bank, Dresdner Bank AG, led to the
resignation of that bank's chief executive, Juergen Sarrazin, in
1997. Earlier this year, Dresdner paid a fine of about $21 million
to settle the charges. Sarrazin also paid a fine and received a
suspended, one-year prison sentence for his role in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the German investigation comes at a time when federal
regulators in the United States have begun re-examining problems
with unclaimed customer funds managed by the Bankers Trust Corp.,
the large American bank that Deutsche bought on June 4.
</P>
<P>
   Unclaimed funds are bank accounts left dormant for a few years;
the money must be turned over to states, which are then responsible
for trying to find the owners. Bankers Trust pleaded guilty in
March to criminal charges of illegally diverting $19.1 million in
cash and other unclaimed funds.
</P>
<P>
   In a public filing with the Department of Labor on June 2
seeking the right to continue managing pensions and other assets,
Bankers Trust noted that it may have to appoint a special
investigator to re-examine the roles played by current Bankers
Trust executives in their internal investigation of the illegal
diversion.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust said it uncovered the fraud in 1996 and quickly
alerted federal authorities. But the extent of the diversion is
much greater than has been publicly disclosed, according to
individuals investigating the bank. New York state alone has
identified more than $41 million owed to it _ more than twice as
much as the bank acknowledged. Some states have started audits into
whether Bankers Trust diverted funds since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust's former chief financial officer, Richard H.
Daniel, resigned from the merged company Wednesday, as reported in
The Wall Street Journal. Daniel was one of the most senior Bankers
Trust officials involved in the investigation of the illegal funds
diversion. A person close to Deutsche said Wednesday that the
Department of Labor has not mentioned Daniel's name as part of
Bankers Trust's application with the agency and that his departure
has nothing to do with that agency's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   At least 12 other Bankers Trust executives are expected to
resign later in the week, but Deutsche Bank declined to say whether
their departures are linked to the illegal funds diversion. Breuer
said in a recent interview that U.S. regulators have granted
Deutsche immunity from any further legal claims relating to the
funds diversion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The charges involving illegal tax diversion in Germany surfaced
after Germany raised capital gains taxes earlier in the decade. As
bank customers looked for ways to shelter that income, German banks
reportedly assisted them by setting up bank accounts in such
tax-free havens as nearby Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   Other Deutsche executives who are being investigated in the
alleged scheme include three current board members, Carl von
Boehm-Bezing, Tessen von Heydebreck, and Juergen Krumnow, as well
as two former board members, Georg Krupp and Ulrich Weiss.
Deutsche's Hartwig said German authorities notified the executives
by letter that they were being investigated sometime ``within the
last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Mergers are always thorny affairs, but the various problems
Deutsche is encountering at the management level here and in
Germany make the combination more difficult. Most of the employees
in Bankers Trust's fixed-income unit are being dismissed and
Deutsche faces a potential problem if Bankers Trust employees it
wishes to retain decide to head for the exits.
</P>
<P>
   Other banks said they have been inundated with resumes from
Bankers Trust employees, and many of those banks said they expect
more resumes once Deutsche pays last year's bonuses to Bankers
Trust employees.

CYCLISTS FIND SCENIC ROUTES IN PICTURESQUE OJAI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK LANGTON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OJAI, Calif. _ As far as scenic bikeways go, you pretty much
have to go to Seattle or San Diego if you want the bike-path
EXPERIENCE. Cycling courses in the Los Angeles area have become
little more than overcrowded sidewalks for in-line skaters, joggers
and a wide assortment of baby strollers.
</P>
<P>
   However, there's a little slice of cycling heaven about an
hour's drive northwest of the San Fernando Valley that harks back
to a time when you could pedal along without having to worry if
you'd be blind-sided by a guy carrying a cooler that resembles a
Kenmore freezer.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura County's Ojai resembles a modern-day stage stop for
neo-Hell's Angels and Southern California tourists, with a touch of
local color thrown in. It seems to be filled with as many recluses
and celebrities (Mary Steenburgen and Ted Danson among them) as
workaday types trying to escape the metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   And running alongside the main roads _ highways 33 and 150 _ and
straight into the heart of Ojai is the 10-mile Ojai Valley Trail.
The wonderfully maintained paved bicycle _ and, yes, skating and
jogging _ trail climbs gradually to the north and east, gaining
about 700 feet in elevation from Foster County Park in nearby
Casitas Springs to Libbey Park in downtown Ojai. It is favored by
road cyclists and mountain bikers alike and attracts tourists,
Southland visitors and resident commuters. The ride can be extended
to 16 miles if cyclists start in Ventura on a soon-to-be-completed
path.
</P>
<P>
   Bicycling and Ojai just seem to go together, and the two often
feed off each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always people on bicycles stopping in. It's easy for
them to park and get their lattes, get a burst of energy, then
continue on up the path,'' said Juno, the espresso slinger behind
the counter at Java Heaven in Ojai Valley Village.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Ojai Valley Trail runs several hundred yards to the
north of Highway 33 at points as it approaches Ojai, Ojai Valley
Village is the only ``civilized'' area between Foster and Libbey
parks. Modern by Ojai standards, Ojai Valley Village boasts not
only a McDonald's but a Taco Bell as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trail'' is not just for recreation. It's also a popular
commuting lane for local residents who would rather ride than
drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trail is very convenient because I can jump on my bicycle
and ride the 3 miles to work, and it takes me about as long as it
does to drive my car, what with parking and walking to the spa,''
said Rick Hermelin, 58, who recently moved from Thousand Oaks to
work as a massage therapist at the Ojai Valley Resort Spa. ``If I
wanted to go faster, I'd ride on the road. But I'm in no hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   Ojai certainly loves to celebrate its artisans. Libbey Park,
with its California live oak canopy and open-air amphitheater,
plays host to several art displays and concerts each summer, the
next of which is the Art Ojai Summer Stroll, which takes place
Saturday from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. (Information: (805) 646-2091.)
Everything from oil paintings to live music will be on display.
</P>
<P>
   It is said that visiting Ojai is much the same as taking a step
back in time; strolling among the local artists' renderings, it's
easy to see why. Prices are straight out of the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of spots in Ojai to eat, drink and be merry,
and none is hard to find. Just walk down ``Main Street'' _ East
Ojai Boulevard _ and take your pick. The fare is eclectic, with
everything from classic Mexican and traditional Chinese to burgers
and fries or fish and chips.
</P>
<P>
   If you're planning to stay the night, check out the Blue Iguana
Inn a couple of miles west of town on Highway 33. It's hard to
resist the huge mosaic tile iguana fountain in the courtyard and a
30-foot tile dragon snaking around the hot tub.
</P>
<P>
   While the Ojai Valley Trail has for years begun and ended at
Foster County Park, that could soon change with an extension to the
south.
</P>
<P>
   ``The section of trail to the beach (in Ventura) should be done
by the end of the month,'' said Robert Coble, owner of Bicycles of
Ojai, where, incidentally, bicycles may be rented.(See accompanying
info box.) ``It's taken a lot longer than projected, and they still
have to finish a few stream crossings. But the pavement is done, so
we're hoping it'll be real soon.''
</P>
<P>
   A naturally occurring phenomenon that you don't want to miss is
the legendary ``pink moment,'' taking place a few minutes each
evening at dusk when the surrounding mountains glow as the sun sets
into the Pacific. With the warm breezes wafting scents of citrus
blossoms from the local orange and lemon groves, it's no wonder
folks return to Ojai to step back in time as often as they can. &QL;

 &HT;    With feet of clay, Robinson stays his path
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oprah tried, and then she tried some more. She wanted Falcons
safety Eugene Robinson to become the Jimmy Swaggart of the NFL on
her couch. Others, ranging from ESPN to Sports Illustrated to ABC's
``20/20,'' also approached Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   No response. Except for close friends and relatives, Robinson
preferred not to reveal his deepest thoughts on getting arrested on
charges of soliciting a Miami undercover cop for oral sex the night
before the Falcons met the Broncos in the Super Bowl in January.
</P>
<P>
   This was Eugene Keefe Robinson, among the Falcons' primary
leaders. He was a devout family man with a wife and two kids. Not
only that, on the morning of the same day of his trip to Miami's
seedy part of town, he won an award for living his deep-rooted
Christian beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Then something happened. Everybody wanted to know what happened,
but except for a couple of public requests by Robinson for
forgiveness, he mostly has remained silent on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a difference between innocence and righteousness, and
although I was innocent, this is kind of a touchy, iffy
situation,'' Robinson said, his words flowing easily. He sat and
shared his feelings with a visitor in a nearly empty locker room at
the Falcons' headquarters in Suwanee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I was down there,'' Robinson said, referring to an area
of Miami known for prostitutes and drug dealers. ``Nobody put a gun
to my head. I was there, and I hollered at (the undercover cop). I
was leaving after that, making my way out, but nobody cares about
that. All they care about is, boom, you were there, and I accept
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson moved closer to the visitor at his locker, before
saying without blinking, ``This is what I've told my friends. 'Hey,
it's on me. Don't look for anybody else. Don't look for any
excuses. I'm the guy. It wasn't a phantom person down there. I'm
telling you this while looking you straight in your eyes, and I'm
asking for your forgiveness.' ``
</P>
<P>
   The early indication is that Robinson's request has been
accepted overwhelmingly. For verification, there is the bulk of his
teammates, still joking with the popular Robinson, still seeking
his advice on matters inside and outside football.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Robinson is amazing onlookers with his work ethic in
the Falcons' current minicamp. ``He's probably in the best shape of
his career,'' Falcons coach Dan Reeves said. The 15-year veteran
looks nearly a decade younger than his 36 years.
</P>
<P>
   However, Robinson's teammates remember that his arrest in Miami
damaged their efforts to beat the Broncos. So Robinson took the
same approach with his teammates this spring that he took with
others last winter once he returned to his Seattle home after the
Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   And the approach? One-on-one honesty.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way,'' Robinson said, ``if they have any questions, I can
address them at that time. I tell them that we're all human and
we're men. I tell them that I'm sorry and that we need to put this
behind us. I really want them to understand that I'm not cavalier
about this thing, and that I care about what happens with this
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't believe it, but I've had some of the hardest
dudes on this team tell me, 'Hey, man, you didn't have to do that.
I appreciate you coming to me, because it wasn't necessary.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said he heard similar words after he called buddies
around the country to ``dispel all of the myths.'' He had a
confrontation with one of his best friends, who Robinson said was
``disseminating wrong information based on conjecture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to pull him aside,'' Robinson said. ``I told him that it
would be easy for me to be bitter and sad after this, but Satan has
won too many battles. I refuse to let him win any more. My friend
told me that he was extremely sorry, and I told him that we all
make mistakes. The difference is that the sin I committed was out
in the open.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the public, where Robinson said the requests
he gets for signing autographs, working clinics and making
appearances remain at the lofty level of before.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Robinson realizes that his ongoing popularity these
days is spiced with curiosity. Earlier this month, as Robinson made
one of his many roundtrips from Seattle to Atlanta, he heard a
woman whispering to her husband as they left the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned and said, 'How are you doing? I'm Eugene Robinson.
You may have heard about me during the Super Bowl,' `` Robinson
said, smiling. ``Now I could read an awful lot into these
situations, but I refuse to. So I'll break the ice for a person in
a minute. People realize that I'm just a regular dude, and they
also see that I won't be held hostage by this.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither will Robinson's wife, Gia, and their 11-year-old
daughter Brittany and 9-year-old son, Brandon. According to
Robinson, ``It's going great with them (since the incident), but
I've got a lot of work to do. I recognize that, but it's part of
the whole deal.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Robinson's continued belief in Romans 8:28: ``And we know
that all things work together for good to them that love God, to
them who are the called according to his purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My situation dispels the myth that all Christians are
goody-two-shoes, straight-laced and self-righteous,'' Robinson
said. ``This throws some humility in there, and it makes people
realize that I suffer from human frailties like everybody else.
What is getting my wife and I through this situation is nothing but
the grace of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen.

   CARGILL EXECUTIVE NAMED IN PRICE-FIXING DOCUMENTS
</P>
<P>
   A senior executive at Archer Daniels Midland told government
investigators that he held secret talks with an executive at
Cargill to rig bids and prices in the citric acid market, according
to recently released documents. Government prosecutors have said
that Cargill did not take part with Archer Daniels and three other
companies in a much broader conspiracy to illegally fix citric acid
prices. But the statements could play a significant role in an
appeal of a class-action suit against Cargill, filed by purchasers
of citric acid who contend they were cheated by the company.

LONG SHADOWS OVER POPE'S BOYHOOD HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (with POPE)

<P>
   WADOWICE, Poland _ As he stood in the main square of his home
town Wednesday night, surrounded by a few surviving old friends and
thousands of cheering local believers, John Paul II departed from
his prepared text and reminisced. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He recalled joyous times, and also the dark days of World War
II, when many of his Jewish friends and neighbors disappeared. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out one building, and said, ``In this house lived
Jurek Kluger,'' without explaining that Kruger was a boyhood friend
who barely survived the Holocaust and now lives in Rome and has
remained close. Later he mentioned his own house, which is now a
museum of the pope's early life.
</P>
<P>
   ``This house, this house where I lived, belonged to Mr. Chaim
Balamuth,'' the pope said. ``I don't know what became him. I think
he died,'' he said to a suddenly silent audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that the Jews of Wadowice endured hard trials. Many
were killed in ghettos and then in camps, because of extermination
acts of the Hitler regime.''
</P>
<P>
   An answer to the pope's rumination about his landlord, whose
name was actually Yechiel Balamuth, was sent June 2 in a letter to
the Vatican by Ron Balamuth, a grandson. Balamuth explained how his
grandfather had died in the Belzec death camp in Poland, and how he
and other surviving grandchildren had been unable to regain title
to the house. A copy of the letter was also sent to The New York
Times on Tuesday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past three decades, we have written letters to the
Vatican, who redirected us to the Polish municipality, who then
directed us to the archbishop of Krakow, who again referred us to
the Polish authorities.'' Belamuth wrote. ``We had many lawyers and
other people of influence try and bring this sad case to your
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that you are appalled by the injustice that was done
to our family and we have faith that you will find the appropriate
way of rectifying those past wrongs.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached by telephone Wednesday night, the pope's spokesman,
Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said he was unaware of the letter, but said
he would check into the matter. He noted that restitution is under
the jurisdiction of local and national authorities in Poland. ``The
Vatican is not involved in this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Balamuth said Wednesday night that he was unaware
that the pope had referred to his grandfather. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pope used the name Chaim Balamuth, who was actually
Yechiel's son, who lived in the same house and was 13 years older
than the pope. The pope's family rented rooms in the house, at 5
Ringplatz, until he and his father moved to Krakow in 1938, a year
before the war began.
</P>
<P>
   Yechiel Balamuth, his wife and three daughters all died in the
Nazi camp at Belzec. The son, Chaim, ended up in a Soviet labor
camp and emigrated to Israel after the war. He died there in 1969. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our family's wish,'' Balamuth wrote, ``that the fact
that both my grandparents, their three daughters and their husbands
and children were exterminated in Nazi death camps will be very
prominently acknowledged and memorialized at the house, which
currently serves exclusively as a pilgrimage site for Catholics who
wish to visit Your Highness' birth place.''

COKE'S CHIEF APOLOGIZES FOR RESPONSE ON CONTAMINATION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France, Luxembourg, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands)   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Coca-Cola's top executive apologized to
European customers Wednesday night in response to a growing public
outcry over its slow response to a soft-drink contamination that
apparently made hundreds of people sick in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   The apology by M. Douglas Ivester, chairman and chief executive
of Coca-Cola, the world's leading soft-drink company, came as
French government officials said that 80 people there had
complained about nausea, fever and headaches. French stores removed
more than 50 million bottles and cans from shelves Wednesday, and
bans on the sale of Coca-Cola products remained in force for a
second day in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Coke executives in Paris Wednesday afternoon,
French officials refused to relax their prohibition and delayed any
public comment until Thursday. Officials in the three other nations
said they were awaiting more information from the company about
what exactly had caused the problem.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, the authorities began checking the origin of Coke
products and removing any that had been bottled in France or
Belgium. A growing number of consumer groups in Germany and
elsewhere complained that Coca-Cola had been opaque and
unreassuring in its public explanations.
</P>
<P>
   The company's trouble comes at a time Belgium is reeling from a
scandal over cattle infected with dioxin, a cancer-causing chemical
that contaminated feed grain used on many Belgian farms. The
scandal forced the resignation of Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dahaene,
as well as the nation's health minister.
</P>
<P>
   It also comes amid an increasingly heated argument between
Europeans and the United States over American-produced genetically
modified food products, which many Europeans want to ban, and over
hormone-treated beef, which is before the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the concern in Europe, Coke's chief, Ivester,
released a statement from the company's Atlanta headquarters
Wednesday seeking to reassure customers. ``The Coca-Cola Company's
highest priority is the quality of our products,'' he said. ``One
hundred thirteen years of our success has been based on the trust
consumers have in that quality. That trust is sacred to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Promising to thoroughly investigate, he said company executives
``deeply regret any problems encountered by our European consumers
in the past few days.''
</P>
<P>
   The tone of his remarks were considerably more conciliatory than
the response from company executives in Brussels, who had insisted
that Coca-Cola Company drinks did not pose a health problem despite
the complaints of nausea and headaches. The company has attributed
the reactions to what it called bad carbon dioxide used at a plant
in Antwerp, Belgium, and to fungicide from packing crates found on
cans at the French port in Dunkirk.
</P>
<P>
   But Coke executives in Europe did little public campaigning to
reassure consumers. There were no signs Wednesday of advertising
and or more comprehensive explanations of how the problem was to be
solved. ``I have the strong feeling that nobody is really
informed,'' said Ivo Mechels, a spokesman for Test-Achats, a
nonprofit consumer research organization in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Those views were echoed in Germany. ``We couldn't get any
information from the company until we had made scores of calls,''
said Kristiana Schaefer, a nutritional scientist at the Consumer
Center, a government-financed consumer advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 people in Belgium, including 38 schoolchildren,
complained of fever, nausea and headaches after drinking Coke
products on Monday. Belgium ordered all Coke products off store
shelves on Monday, followed up by France, Luxembourg and the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   The bans affect all Coke drinks, as well as most of the
company's other soft drinks and juices: Diet Coke, Fanta, Sprite,
mineral water and Minute Maid fruit juices.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, where Coca-Cola operates 32 bottling plants,
government inspectors found no signs of contamination today and
said drinks bottled in the country were still safe. But they warned
about products bottled in Belgium or France and brought over the
border. In the city of Trier, local officials seized 2,500 cans
with French markings.
</P>
<P>
   Although the problem affects less than 1 percent of Coca-Cola's
global sales, it is the biggest product recall in the company's
history. It remains unclear how seriously it will affect Coca-Cola
over the longer term.
</P>
<P>
   Robin S. Socha, a consultant at Control Risks Germany, which
advises corporations on responding to crises, said companies were
frequently caught between the desire to inform their customers and
their fear of losing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``In crises like this one, a company has to draw a line,'' the
consultant said. ``It has to take care of its business and protect
its clients at the same time. Whatever they say, they will either
anger customers by saying too little or endanger their business.''

 &HT;    Problems called part of political tapestry
 &HT;    EDs: 1ST UPDATE; changes throughout
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The harsh reaction in Europe to the Coca-Cola health
scare should be seen in the context of politics and not as part of
a wave of anti-Americanism, experts said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't jump to the idea that sees this as an attack on a
multinational,'' said Robert B. Zoellick, counselor and
undersecretary for economic and agricultural affairs at the State
Department during the Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   Zoellick, now associated with the Washington-based Center for
Strategic and International Studies, attributed Belgium's quick ban
on Coke products to rising concern in Europe about food poisoning
and environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, the media and government have for months been locked
in nasty debate over safety of genetically modified food, a fairly
common and noncontroversial part of American diets. Additionally,
fears over ``mad cow disease'' still ripple through European food
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Europe is being reassembled under a unified economy,
there is no independent central authority for assuring food safety.
In the absence of such a body, food scares often become hot
political weapons.
</P>
<P>
   John McIntyre, director of the Georgia Tech Center for
International Business Education and Research, said the Coke ban is
part of a ``power play'' between national governments and the
European Union's consumer affairs commission over control of food
regulations. The Belgian government apparently moved decisively
with the expectation that the EU would act if it didn't, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're (Europeans) very jittery,'' McIntyre added.
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre said Coca-Cola's relations with the Europeans were
already strained. The Atlanta-based company has angered the EU by
trying to ``pick off one country at a time'' with proposed
acquisitions of beverage operations, instead of going to the
European Commission.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bromis Verhage, marketing professor at Georgia State
University, said Coca-Cola's management showed a ``lack of
sensitivity'' by not taking decisive action more quickly after
initial reports that 100 Belgian schoolchildren had taken ill,
given the fact that ``the whole country is sensitive to food
poisoning.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Other companies should learn from Coke's experience, Verhage
said. ``It seems that every company should pull out its crisis plan
and be very sensitive when problems like this occur.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Zoellick added, ``The basic lesson is react quickly to restore
public confidence.

CLINTON VOW TO CONGRESS ENDS A THREAT TO HIS NOMINATIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has promised to make no more
appointments when Congress is in recess without notifying Senate
leaders before the recess. In response, a Republican senator
Wednesday withdrew his threat to block all presidential
nominations, including that of Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers to be Treasury Secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The snarl developed after Clinton, on June 4 with Congress on a
10-day recess for Memorial Day, appointed James Hormel to be
ambassador to Luxembourg. Under the Constitution, the president may
make recess appointments when the Senate is not in session to vote
on confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel is the first openly gay U.S. ambassador. The heir to his
family's meat-packing fortune, he has been a big contributor to gay
organizations and Democrats. Republican leaders have refused for
two years to allow a vote on his nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Outraged by what he called ``flagrant abuse of the recess
appointment power,'' Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., announced on June
8 that he would exercise his prerogative to hold up all
presidential nominations, and no confirmation votes have been held
since.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the prospect that Summers might not be confirmed, the
international financial markets fluttered briefly after Inhofe's
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Hormel appointment, Clinton had followed a practice
dating from the Reagan administration of notifying Senate leaders
before a recess if he intended to make a recess appointment. In the
case of Hormel, however, the leaders were not notified until June
3, the night before the appointment was made, when the Senate had
already been in recess for almost a week.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter dated June 15 to Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the
majority leader, Clinton essentially said he would not do this
again. Hormel can remain ambassador until the 106th Congress
adjourns in fall 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``My administration has made it a practice to notify Senate
leaders in advance of our intentions in this regard, and this
precedent will continue to be observed,'' Clinton wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe, who never had the full support of Republican leaders,
said he was satisfied. ``My holds were never designed to undo the
appointment of Mr. Hormel,'' the senator said. ``They were designed
to uphold the Senate's proper role in the `advise and consent'
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has not explained why he broke practice in the case of
Hormel. Presumably, it was out of exasperation. Although a majority
of Senators have said they would vote to confirm Hormel, many
conservative Republicans object. Bowing to their wishes, the
party's leaders refused to allow a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe has called Hormel ``a gay activist who puts his agenda
ahead of the agenda of America.''

 &HT;    U.S. Franchise enters Honduras
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ U.S. Franchise Systems (ticker symbol USFS), whose
stock has jumped from a low of $4 in September to more than $20
now, said Wednesday that a Microtel Inn &AMP; Suites has opened in San
Pedro Sula, Honduras. It is the first hotel property in Latin
America that carries a U.S. Franchise Systems brand name.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-room hotel is owned by Connor/Jacobson Hotels, which also
has a license with U.S. Franchise Systems to develop nearly a dozen
hotels in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Panama over the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The financial markets are such in Latin America that a lot of
development depends on what the economic situation is at the
moment,'' said Michael Leven, chief executive officer of
Atlanta-based U.S. Franchise Systems. The company franchises
Microtel, Hawthorn Suites and Best Inns &AMP; Suites brands.
</P>
<P>
   The company will not own or manage any of the properties in
Latin America, which has the potential for as many as 30 sites
overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the brand to be in major cities and near airports so
they can be exposed to travelers who are moving from country to
country,'' Leven said. ``The objective here is to get the brand
name, Microtel, in front of as many travel agents and consumers as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, they are in the very, very early stages of what
they could potentially do internationally,'' said John J. Rohs, an
analyst with Schroder Securities in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Honduras Microtel is only the second international hotel
franchised by U.S. Franchise Systems now open. A Hawthorn Suites is
in operation in Tel Aviv, Israel. The company has agreements on
planned hotels in Brazil and Argentina and is in talks with
prospective franchisees in Mexico, southern Africa, Canada and
Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a question, an important part of this is that the
company has emerged firmly into profit territory after a first
couple of years of start-up losses,'' said Rohs. ``They've
eliminated the doubts that some non-believers had of the ability of
this company to be profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Franchise Systems stock closed Wednesday at $20.12 1/2, up
62 1/2 cents.

A PORTRAITIST WHO BLENDED DELICACY AND GRANDEUR  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MATTHEW GUREWITSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes his royal patron was slow to pay, but in the main
England was good to Anthony Van Dyck. He first crossed the Channel
at age 21, summoned to the court of James I as the outstanding
disciple of the magisterial Rubens and already a star in his own
right. That brief stay, from late 1620 into early 1621, was a
prelude to his reign as ``principalle Paynter in ordinary their
Majesties,'' beginning in 1632.
</P>
<P>
   Charles I, a sovereign whose passion for art was no pose, made
him Sir Anthony that same year. Apart from an interval back home in
Brabant from early 1634 to early 1635, Van Dyck remained in England
for the rest of his too brief life. Death claimed him at home in
Blackfriars in 1641. His bones lie at St. Paul's.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Antwerp ever neglected or forgot him. On the town's
Fifth Avenue, the Meir, the casual stroller will discover a
handsome bronze presenting the native son as a gentleman of
youthful yet self-possessed aspect, feathered hat in hand, sporting
the mustaches and pointed tuft on the chin to which he gave his
name. A more compulsive observer soon spots Antoon van Dijck
Straat, the birthhouse of Antoon van Dijck, the Sir Anthony Van
Dijck Restaurant and the Ijssalon Van Dijck (an ice-cream parlor),
the Residence Van Dyck (an apartment house), Van Dyck Glass and
Mirrors, and who knows what other more casual memorials. (After a
while, the motley spellings cease to jar.)
</P>
<P>
   What one does not find in any notable profusion in Antwerp are
Van Dyck paintings. True, the Royal Museum of Fine Arts has a late
``Lamentation'' (1635), a prize example of the painter's sacred
style, holding an eloquent balance of dignity and tenderness. Nor
is his handiwork entirely absent from the churches. But when the
world thinks of Van Dyck, the world thinks above all of the
portraits, in particular the full-length likenesses of the rich and
mighty of England and the Continent.
</P>
<P>
   The bias in Anglo-Saxon territories favors his second English
period, which set the stage for Gainsborough and Reynolds. The
mind's eye of the Italian, by the same token, conjures up the
legacy of the years Van Dyck flourished in Genoa and Palermo,
emulating the genius of Titian.
</P>
<P>
   At the last major Van Dyck show, in Genoa in 1997, the signori
of the 1620s foregathered from every point of the compass in
gorgeously festive assembly. Not to be outdone, Antwerp celebrates
the 400th anniversary of the artist's birth with the richest
panorama of his work Europe has seen in a century. The main event,
at the Royal Museum of Fine Arts, presents the top of his line:
some 100 of his roughly 800 surviving canvases (through Aug. 15; at
the Royal Academy, London, Sept. 16 to Dec. 15).
</P>
<P>
   Over the same period, the Rubens House displays Van Dyck's
landscape sketches, watercolors of unknown purpose, presumably
executed for his private delight and perhaps distributed among
friends as gifts. This material, mostly from the British Museum, is
the rarest of the rare.
</P>
<P>
   Some two dozen of only 30 known sheets will be on view,
supporting the thesis that Van Dyck was Europe's first plein-air
artist and provoking the great question: why? We associate the
phrase more readily with Constable or the Barbizon School. On
canvas, for Van Dyck, as for Giorgione, Titian and Veronese,
landscape meant background.
</P>
<P>
   A third show, at the Platin-Moretus Museum, focuses on Van
Dyck's etchings, deluxe wares for the collectors market, exemplary
in quality but to modern eyes rather antiquarian.
</P>
<P>
   ``My best student.'' Thus Rubens described Van Dyck at the age
of 19, and the tag never came unstuck. Maybe now it will. In any
case, the translation is open to question. Writing in Italian,
Rubens used the word discipolo, which covers a range of meanings
from pupil to follower to assistant. Certainly, it was never the
putdown it sounds like.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two years Van Dyck's senior, a linguist, antiquarian and
diplomat as well as an artist, with prestige to burn and a thriving
studio of assistants, Rubens appraised the field from the
perspective of his own lofty eminence. His ``best student'' was one
whose work he could recommend to the notice of an important
collector, though of course the master would expect to apply
finishing touches with his own hand.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Van Dyck had by this time already registered _ a very
young master indeed _ with Antwerp's Guild of St. Luke's. Before
long, he would be setting up a studio of his own. Surely the words
of Rubens are best understood as a combination of salesmanship with
avuncular metaphor. Though the evidence of Van Dyck's sketchbooks
shows him to have enjoyed unparalleled visiting privileges at the
Rubens studio from his youngest years, he actually served his
apprenticeship with Hendrik van Balen I, now scarcely remembered
even by specialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``My best student'' _ it took singular talent to earn that
compliment. Yet for all the lessons in stagecraft, color and
lighting Van Dyck had the skill to absorb, the elder artist's
sensibility left the discipolo untouched. The art of Rubens is an
art of muchness _ muchness to the point of surfeit, and often. In
celebrating Marie de Medici _ widow of Henri IV, mother of Louis
XIII and dreadnought regent through the perilous years of his
minority _ he decked out history in mythological trappings so
extravagant that even the tragic episodes verge on comedy for the
gods. (The gargantuan series now hangs at the Louvre.)
</P>
<P>
   Opportunities to strike such pompous themes never came his way.
While he excelled in all other princely genres, history painting _
the pinnacle of his aspirations _ was not to be his metier. Even if
it had, such theatrics from his hand are scarcely conceivable.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the older artist, Van Dyck tempered grandeur with
delicacy. Against the ruddy Olympian vigor of Rubens, he displays
an aristocratic refinement. The upholstered females and unbuttoned
menfolk of Rubens reflect a ravenous personality, in love with
flesh, quick to seize it with both hands. The imagery bespeaks the
pleasures of touch; the figures seem modeled first and colored
later, the hectic skin tones laid on like too much rouge.
(Tellingly enough, Rubens dabbled in sculpture.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Van Dyck's vision, however, is diaphanous. His brush, like those
of his exact contemporary Velasquez and the incomparable Titian
before them, captures an image as impalpably yet as entirely as the
eye itself.
</P>
<P>
   In some artists who share it, though not in these three, this
property of unmediated perception entails a clinician's
abstraction: the glare of the mirror or chill of the scalpel. In
Van Dyck, it takes on a discreet benevolence, easy to reconcile
with the observant yet respectful, vulnerable air of the
self-portraits from different stages of his career.
</P>
<P>
   On a quick reading of his portraits of others, a viewer's
attention may seize on details of costume: light yet luxurious
fabrics of dress and coat, feathery laces of cuff and collar. To
meet the people, we must pause. At first glance, the expressions of
Van Dyck's grandees may seem bland: poised yet relaxed in a manner
calculated to please the subject. And why not? Van Dyck prospered
by catering to the prosperous. The job was not to read their minds
but to show them to advantage: picture-perfect, their social masks
firmly in place. Yet again and again, with exquisite tact, Van Dyck
found ways to reveal the living face.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt this was easier when painting a member of his
professional circle. At the Frick Collection in Manhattan, Van
Dyck's portrait of Frans Snyders, a fellow artist in Antwerp who
specialized in still lifes and animal paintings, conveys, as well
as the sitter's thoughtfulness and probity, the portraitist's
affection.
</P>
<P>
   In the half-length Thomas Howard, Second Earl of Arundel, on
loan to Antwerp from the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, too
much sympathy would have been presumption. But Van Dyck spied in
that mighty patron an incongruous wariness and let it show, neither
flattering nor criticizing. The full-length Henry Danvers, Earl of
Danby, from the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, touches lightly on the
fragility of the man beneath the weight of his court dress and the
heavy chain of the Order of the Golden Fleece.
</P>
<P>
   The full-length triple portrait, ``The Balbi Children,'' from
the National Gallery in London, finds the young subjects on their
best behavior by a pair of classical columns, yet here, too, the
result is generously humane. Prince Ruprecht of the Palatinate,
from the Museum of Art History in Vienna, presents a pale,
melancholy lad of regal consequence: a Danvers in the making,
perhaps, rather sad though not pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere, though, do Van Dyck's gifts of heart and eye converge
with greater felicity than in his state portraits of parents with
children. The Antwerp show illustrates the point many times over
with masterpieces from the world's richest storehouses, but the
case may also be made from three canvases from the permanent
collection of the Louvre. The hand of a woman in a portrait from
the second Antwerp period clutches the arm of her chair, betraying
her tension under the artist's scrutiny, but her brow is smooth and
her lips stir with barely suppressed amusement as her overdressed
toddler barges in for attention.
</P>
<P>
   In a pendant portrait, a gentleman receives a similar visit, and
his features light up with affection. The son of a third sitter has
the greater patience and polished manners of an older boy; his
presence fills his father with quiet pride. The intimacy between
generations _ so injurious to the propriety insecure grownups cling
to among their peers _ dispels the tedium of the long sitting.
</P>
<P>
   Within the framework of timeless formality, Van Dyck catches a
flash of the candid. In the Antwerp selection, such freshness
appears, too, in the magnificent Queen Henrietta Maria with Sir
Jeffrey Hudson, from the National Gallery in Washington, which is
not quite the picture it seems. His cherubic visage and neat
proportions notwithstanding, Sir Jeffrey is not a child but a
dwarf, whose license to create mischief at court appears in the
visible form of his pet monkey, restrained by the queen's ivory
hand.
</P>
<P>
   From Queen Elizabeth II come no fewer than three canvases of
Charles I: one in the robes of the Order of the Garter, another on
horseback attended by an equerry and the third a tour de force
showing Van Dyck's royal patron in three positions. Her Majesty is
also sending one of several treatments of ``St. Martin Dividing His
Cloak'' (another very youthful and very poignant one may be seen on
the way to the Brussels airport at St. Martin's Church in the
village of Zaventem) and a ``Cupid and Psyche.''
</P>
<P>
   Loans from sources in Brussels; Dresden, Germany; Genoa, Italy;
Kortrijk, Belgium; London; Madrid and Paris round out the picture
with examples in the artist's sacred and profane, biblical and
mythological veins.
</P>
<P>
   As the world can hardly fail to see in the presence of such
evidence, Rubens' best student was at heart his own best teacher,
as true masters must be.

BETTER MEDICINE ON LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Science, like every other field, is being transformed by the
computer age, and as is true in all human endeavors _ even one
committed to pushing back the frontiers of knowledge _ the old
guard is resisting change.
</P>
<P>
   A stern editorial in last week's New England Journal of Medicine
criticized Dr. Harold Varmus, director of the National Institutes
of Health, for his forward-looking proposal to establish a Web site
to disseminate research papers more quickly than the laborious
print publication process allows.
</P>
<P>
   The lag between acceptance and publication can be a year or more
_ too slow for galloping developments in genetic engineering and
disease research.
</P>
<P>
   But The New England Journal of Medicine, like The Journal of the
American Medical Association and others, has long traded on being
the venerable gatekeeper for research. The notion that a paper
could appear on a Web site almost as soon as the authors finished
writing it is anathema to these editors, who fear losing not only
control but revenue to a free-wheeling Internet.
</P>
<P>
   They should relax. Varmus is not excluding them. He proposes a
two-tiered system for publication on the Web site, dubbed
``E-biomed.'' The first tier would follow tradition, posting papers
vetted by scientific journals _ but posting them immediately upon
acceptance. The second tier would bypass that strict review process
and include partial research, follow-ups on previous papers,
developments in arcane subfields, and even experiments that failed,
on the theory that blind alleys can teach a person as much as a
``Eureka!''
</P>
<P>
   Web site postings could include extensive supporting data, even
films and recordings, and would encourage immediate feedback. True,
some junk may get out there, but it's out there now. Varmus, who
calls for an interdisciplinary governing board to oversee the Web
site, is also asking for suggestions on how to make his fine idea
work.
</P>
<P>
   Journal editors should support him and relish the adventure of
change. Evolution is not only inevitable but usually makes survival
a lot easier.

GRASS-ROOTS POLITICS LOOKS FOR AN OPENING IN SERBIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ When a small number of residents of Cacak
gathered for a weekly prayer session during the NATO bombing
campaign, they immediately came under police surveillance. When
they started daily meetings in the Town Hall, the organizers were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Grass-roots politics is barely alive in Serbia. Despite the
widespread dissatisfaction with the leadership of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, the chances for rapid change are
small, two leaders of popular movements said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As it became clearer that Milosevic has arranged a deal with the
Radical Party of Serbia, led by Vojislav Seselj, to prevent it from
leaving the government and preserve the status quo, the democratic
opposition faced one option, to go to the streets. For the moment,
however, that is impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Verica Barac, a lawyer employed by the Cacak City Council, is an
organizer of the Civic Parliament, a group set up by residents of
Cacak, 60 miles south of Belgrade, to create a forum for freedom of
speech. She was arrested with five others for holding an illegal
gathering and has seen her forum dwindle in recent weeks under
police repression.
</P>
<P>
   The police have been given added powers under the state of war
declared by the government shortly after NATO began its bombing,
and they can grant or deny permission for any demonstration or
public gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Dragoljub Stosic, a former bus driver and the president of the
Union of Free Trade Unions of Yugoslavia, is fighting 100 court
cases for union members who have been discharged because of their
association with his organization.
</P>
<P>
   Stosic and Ms. Barac say it will take prolonged protests to
remove Milosevic or even push him toward political change. But they
say that right now they cannot begin to rally people.
</P>
<P>
   The Civic Parliament of Cacak drew 500 people at its peak a
month ago, before the police began their arrests, Ms. Barac said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were people from all across the social spectrum,'' she
said in an interview in Belgrade on Wednesday. ``And we saw that
beside their great fear most of the people understand that
something is wrong, because over the last 10 years we have been
living worse and worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is not to fight for power. But our forum is trying to
enable citizens to gather on squares and speak freely, as in
classic democracies.''
</P>
<P>
   They chose prayer meetings to counter the government's
organizing of daily pop concerts on the main square in Belgrade
during the war, she said. ``We think that the terrible things that
happened to us over the last 10 years were caused by our silence,''
Ms. Barac added.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all her modest aims, she and five other Civic Parliament
members were arrested by police May 23 and given heavy fines for
participating in an illegal gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Since the arrests, a few people have braved the police
harassment. The democratic opposition runs the Cacak City Council
but has been powerless in the face of the security forces.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the council, Mayor Velimir Ilic, has disappeared. He
is widely thought to have fled to neighboring Montenegro after
police had issued an order for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   An eminent university professor has been put on trial, and the
police have called in and interviewed a number of members of the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Extensive demonstrations are required to bring about political
change, Ms. Barac said, and that can occur only when the government
lifts the state of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will have to go out onto the streets, because
without massive majority pressure on the government even the most
basic things cannot be changed,'' she said. ``It might seem that
the government is so strong. But with the lifting of the state of
war, people will surely go out on the streets to show that they are
not stupid and that they will not put up with calling this a
victory, a situation in which we lost part of our territory and
suffered this whole tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Stosic said people were primed for a popular explosion after the
debacle in Kosovo. ``Public opinion is already changing,'' he said.
``And what has happened now is the last drop in the glass.''
</P>
<P>
   His union has 5,000 members and was at the forefront of the
democratic demonstrations in 1996. Asked whether he was going to
organize demonstrations again, he said, ``We are going to lead the
river of dissatisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   He warned that several thousand army and police officers were
going to arrive in Serbia in a few days, displaced from their
houses in Kosovo, and that could cause unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot tell you their attitude,'' Stosic said. ``But I can
tell what their mood will be when they realize they were
double-crossed and no one will help them but themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   He also warned that workers would start to feel the double
effects of sanctions and bombing, as industries will not be able to
resurrect themselves without outside investment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Stosic can only wait and hope that the state of war is
lifted, so he can start to organize demonstrations. ``We are going
to need civic protest as in 1996,'' he said, ``and as far as I am
concerned, we are not going to stop until there are really
significant changes. I expect great changes in the next few
months.''
</P>
<P>
   He describes Milosevic's Yugoslavia as the last communist
bastion in Europe. Stosic's hope is for changes, in the footsteps
of the Polish Solidarity movement or the Czech model of a velvet
revolution, where churches, trade unions, universities and ordinary
citizens rallied together.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he conceded that the opposition was virtually powerless.
``It seems this government is strong,'' Stosic said. ``It is as
strong as we are weak.''
</P>
<P>
   But worse, Serbian society is hopelessly confused and divided.
``This evil has continued for so long that the people are
disoriented,'' Stosic said, adding that he was worried that
unhappiness could result in serious unrest or even civil war.

 &HT;    Faulder to be executed amid an international furor
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _In 1977, when Joseph Stanley Faulder was first
convicted of killing an East Texas widow in a botched robbery, the
case seemed fairly open and shut.
</P>
<P>
   Bent on stealing cash he thought she had stashed in a floor
safe, then angered when he found it empty, two Texas juries
determined that Faulder had bound and gagged Inez Phillips with
tape, then beat her on the head with a blackjack and stabbed her. A
maid found Phillips' body the next day, a knife protruding from her
chest.
</P>
<P>
   For that, jurors thought Faulder should pay the ultimate price:
death by lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder's attempts to avoid execution, scheduled for 6 p.m.,
have been pegged not on innocence but on diplomatic mistakes, a
200-year-old federal law, a discredited Texas psychiatrist and
assertions that, because he suffered a serious brain injury when he
was a child, he may be a victim of the most active capital
punishment machine in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case has been through every facet that it could possibly
go through,'' said Odis Hill, the former Gregg County district
attorney who prosecuted Faulder. ``I'll be glad when this thing
comes to a conclusion that the jury has determined.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Faulder, 61, moved several steps closer to the
lethal needle. The U.S. Supreme Court and the 5th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals rejected his latest appeals and the Texas Board of
Pardons and Paroles refused to recommend clemency.
</P>
<P>
   ``His arguments were not compelling,'' Parole Board Chairman
Victor Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush hinted that he will not intervene. ``I have
seen no new evidence that questions the jury's verdict that he is
guilty of this crime. In fact, his request for commutation was not
based on any claim of innocence,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   A former auto mechanic who was convicted at two separate trials
and has spent 22 years on Texas' death row, Faulder two weeks ago
refused to discuss his case with parole board members and instead
railed against the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin state and federal courts, Faulder's attorneys tried
unsuccessfully to have Texas' secret clemency system declared
unconstitutional. They also unsuccessfully raised questions about
the testimony by Dr. James Grigson, a psychiatrist who labeled
Faulder a sociopath after interviewing him for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Grigson, once nicknamed Dr. Death because of the testimony he
offered against suspects in 400 capital murder cases, was expelled
from the American Psychiatric Association in 1995 amid controversy
over his ability to make such predictions. In a recent interview
with the Toronto Star, Grigson said he stood by his assessment of
Faulder.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder's lawyers also have argued his execution should be
stopped because police did not give Faulder, a Canadian citizen,
the opportunity to contact Canadian diplomats after his arrest _ a
right guaranteed foreign citizens under a 1963 international treaty
called the Vienna Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Had Faulder been able to contact Canadian diplomats in Texas,
his attorneys argue, he could have gotten help preparing his
defense _ including evidence of the head injury he suffered when he
fell out of a car in 1941 at age 4. His lawyers believe that
evidence could have prevented the death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   By age 9, he was having seizures blamed on the head injury, and
doctors said he had erratic brain-wave patterns. As a teen-ager, he
was repeatedly in trouble for fights and stealing. By the time he
was 25, had had been in prison twice for car theft.
</P>
<P>
   While Faulder's attorneys insist his brain injury could have
triggered violent impulses, a key question remains: Did Faulder
murder Phillips during such an impulse?
</P>
<P>
   No way, say investigators and prosecutors in the case. By all
indications his behavior on the day of the killing was more
criminal that mental, and he wasn't high on drugs or alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the diplomatic mistake and head injury have become
focal points in an international controversy over the case _ with
an array of Canadian officials and lawmakers, the human rights arm
of the Organization of American States, even U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright weighing in on Faulder's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Faulder went to court in Houston seeking to block
his execution under the Alien Tort Claims Act, a 200-year-old
federal law that allows foreign citizens to sue U.S. officials if
they have been harmed by breaches of treaties. A federal judge
refused to block Faulder's execution.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As a teen-ager in the late 1950s, Cary Hoffman spent
hours locked away in his bedroom listening to Frank Sinatra on his
phonograph. He was an awkward and lonesome kid, but the Sinatra
songs could make him feel as if he had the world on a string and
was sitting on a rainbow with the string around his finger.
</P>
<P>
   Like others who resisted his era's lure of rock and roll, he
longed to swagger like Sinatra, to be in the middle of a big band
with a strutting Nelson Riddle arrangement belting songs like
``Night and Day'' and ``I've Got You Under My Skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike those other teen-agers, Hoffman actually tried to fashion
a career as a saloon singer. He never made it beyond the circuit of
Catskills hotels and bungalow colonies, and consoled himself by
patching together a show business career as a commercial jingle
writer, talent manager and comedy club owner.
</P>
<P>
   But after 35 years and approaching the age of 60, Cary Hoffman
has finally realized his young man's fantasy of swinging like
Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   On most Thursday nights for the last year, Hoffman has been
found in a usually packed Manhattan nightclub singing the Sinatra
canon with a 14-piece band that has mastered the classic Riddle and
Billy May arrangements, down to the slurping trombones and sassy
trumpets. Although he got the job just over a year ago by
serendipity _ when he went to the Red Blazer, at 32 West 37th St.,
as a customer and quickly found himself on stage _ his patience
finally paid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like a kid in a candy store,'' he said, recalling his
first time singing at the Red Blazer. ``I never thought I would
live to be in the middle of a band playing that stuff with great
musicians, guys who play Broadway shows, playing it right on the
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman does not look or live like Sinatra. ``I'm not Frank
Sinatra, in case you folks haven't realized,'' he alerted his
audience last Thursday night. ``I'm a Jewish guy from Queens.''
</P>
<P>
   He has a popeyed, genial face, more homespun than handsome, and
until recently affected a stubbly goatee. He is a vegetarian who
does not smoke and only occasionally drinks a glass of wine. He
jogs and is in therapy. He has been married to the same woman _
Suzanne Hoffman _ for almost 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not exactly a ring-a-ding-ding sort of Sinatra guy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   At moments, his pealing baritone approximates Sinatra's, and all
those years of record-listening have made him sensitive to
Sinatra's dead-on phrasing and beguiling improvisations.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's audience, Mary McGeachy, a magazine industry
executive, said, ``You close your eyes and you hear Sinatra.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are purists like Jonathan Schwartz, the disk
jockey who has a radio program monopolized by Sinatra songs, who
find the idea of an act like Hoffman's ``embarrassing,'' however
earnest it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all of art, the trick is to find your own voice,'' said
Schwartz, who has never heard Hoffman sing. ``The records exist,
the real McCoy exists. Why should I hear a guy named Hoffman
pretend to be something he's not?''
</P>
<P>
   To such criticism, Hoffman replies that he does not consciously
do an impersonation.
</P>
<P>
   All he wants to do, he said, is to pay tribute to Sinatra's
music and strive, however impossibly, to emulate Sinatra's gift for
evoking need or heartbreak or exhilaration. ``He created a style of
intimate singing, converting the art of conversation into beautiful
music, and I want to keep it alive,'' Hoffman said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Sinatra, Hoffman did not exactly do it his way. The
genesis for his act goes back to when he was 4 and his father, a
Lower East Side lox slicer drafted into the Army in World War II,
was killed in a car accident on leave. His mother, Molly, a
one-time singer, moved the family into the nearby apartment of her
three brothers, Joe, Charlie and Hymie Small, all studio musicians.
Charlie had played with the Tommy Dorsey orchestra, and Joe was to
back Sinatra up on recordings like ``Saturday Night Is the
Loneliest Night of the Week.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he died,'' he said of his father, ``my mother went to
live in a house full of music. If he had lived, I probably would
have become the owner of a chain of appetizing stores.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother remarried and moved first to Queens and then to
Westbury, N.Y. At 14 and 15, Cary listened to the new Sinatra, both
torchier and more up-tempo, on Capitol Records.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was he and I, and he was talking to me,'' he said. ``He was
singing, `In the Wee Small Hours,' and I didn't know anything about
love. Somehow, that spoke to me. Maybe it was the loneliness of my
life, not having a dad. I was kind of a loner, and Sinatra became a
musical friend.''
</P>
<P>
   And also ``a father image,'' he said. He determined to try to
become a Sinatra, but his mother pushed him to study a profession,
and he graduated from New York University with a degree in
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Not willing to forsake his dream, he and a friend drove to the
Catskills and styled themselves as another Dean Martin-Jerry Lewis
duo, with Hoffman singing and his friend poking fun.
</P>
<P>
   But after five years, he was still doing weddings and bar
mitzvahs. One luminous moment was a fleeting encounter with Sinatra
himself, contrived by his agent, outside Jilly's, Sinatra's
favorite Manhattan hangout.
</P>
<P>
   When the agent invited Sinatra to come to hear Hoffman, Sinatra
stepped into his limousine and politely said, ``Send me a demo.''
Hoffman sent him a tape of a single, non-Sinatra song. He never
received a reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized the handwriting was one the wall,'' he said. ``I
was not going to be this thing. An artist who becomes a big star
has to be an original. Sinatra was a one-of-a-kind original. Cary
Hoffman was not.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1965, he gave up singing. He and a friend, Ira Gasman, wrote
songs, one of which, ``Congratulations,'' made the country-music
charts, and an off- Broadway musical. He wrote jingles for Grand
Union and sang Sinatra's ``Come Fly With Me'' for a chain of
Midwestern fish restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, he bought the Stand-Up N.Y. comedy club on the West
Side and later took up management of eight comics and writers.
</P>
<P>
   All this time, he never lost his Sinatra fantasy. Shortly before
Sinatra died on May 14, 1998, a friend took him to the Red Blazer
to hear the Stan Rubin orchestra, known for its Swing Era
re-creations. ``All of a sudden, in the loins of my body, an old
dream is starting to surface and I say these words to him: `Do you
have any of the Nelson Riddle-Billy May arrangements of the 1950s?'
To me, that stuff is Mozart. He says: `Are you kidding? I've got 75
of them.' When he says that, I almost lose my breath.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin asked him to sing ``Night and Day,'' and he did, ``as big
and loud as I've ever done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, Hoffman started a series of appearances with the
band every other Thursday night that eventually became every
Thursday. He will linger at least until the end of this month, and
there have been talks about continuing his act through the summer.
</P>
<P>
   At the club, Hoffman has learned to his amusement that there are
still young people who carry his old Sinatra torch. ``The other
night, a kid says to me, `Do you mind if I come up and sing
`Witchcraft,''' he recalled, shaking his head to convey the
rejection he gave. ``So his girlfriend says, `He's pretty good.'''

HOUSE REJECTS GOP ANTIVIOLENCE MEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Wednesday rejected a GOP measure to crack
down on ``violently obscene'' video games, music, and movies as
Republicans and Democrats embarked on a wide-ranging debate over
their competing visions of how to reduce youth violence.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment, aimed at the entertainment industry and sponsored
by Judiciary Committee chairman Henry Hyde of Illinois, was
rejected by a vote of 282-146. Members of both parties criticized
the measure banning the sale to minors of violent or sexually
explicit material as a threat to the Constitution's guarantee of
free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe this tramples on the First Amendment and . . . on
the rights of parents,'' said Mark Foley, a Florida Republican.
``It won't solve the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 249-181, the House approved a series of law
enforcement measures aimed at juvenile offenders, including
imposing stricter penalties for numerous crimes and giving
prosecutors the discretion to charge a juvenile as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate Wednesday was only a prelude to a showdown
Thursday over whether the House will follow the Senate and pass
tough new gun-control measures in consequence of the rampage at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., in which 12 students and
a teacher were killed by two students who later committed suicide.
President Clinton lobbied long distance for passage of a measure
that would make background checks mandatory for all firearms bought
at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I urge you to stand up to the gun lobby once again,'' he wrote
to dozens of lawmakers in a letter from an international conference
in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the House chamber, lobbying by gun-control advocates and
opponents was intense, with the National Rifle Association pushing
to weaken the Senate version. Inside, the GOP tried, without much
success, to shift the discussion from gun control to cultural
issues that it said are the root cause of youth violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberals demagogue tragedies like school shootings to push
their left-wing agenda,'' said the Republican whip, Tom DeLay of
Texas. ``But the big problem in America is not gun ownership. The
big problem is the abandonment of God in the public arena.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans lauded their juvenile justice bill as an attempt to
close loopholes and toughen the law for young criminals, but
Democrats accused Republicans of doing the bidding of the NRA and
avoiding the real culprit, guns, by pushing for curbs on violent
images. Waving a remote control in one hand and a cardboard gun in
the other, Florida Democrat Robert Wexler shouted, ``Instead of gun
control, we're doing remote control.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Joe Moakley, a Boston Democrat, said, ``I for one
believe the welfare of our children should be put before partisan
politics. But that's not going to happen today . . . because
partisan politics won out over common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   By midweek, powerful disagreements over how to address gun
violence, pitting suburban moderates and liberals against gun
advocates from mostly Western and Southern states, already had
fractured both parties. Democratic leaders cried foul when GOP
leaders decided to sever the gun-control measures from the juvenile
justice bill, giving their members the political cover to vote to
for one without the other.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats who favored gun control fumed over the move, privately
conceding they were unlikely to prevail, while party unity among
Republicans on the floor appeared to collapse late in the afternoon
as rank-and-file members lined up to criticize Hyde's amendment
banning violent and sexual material.
</P>
<P>
   The Hyde antiviolence amendment would have restricted minors'
access to art, video games, movies, books, and musical recordings
that were deemed to contain ``explicit sexual material or explicit
violent material.'' Hyde said it was ``designed to slow the flood
of toxic waste into kids' minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California, the mother
of teenagers, said she was troubled that under the Republicans'
proposals, a clerk who sold her child ``Shakespeare in Love'' might
be subject to criminal sanctions while someone who sold her child a
firearm would not.
</P>
<P>
   While members of both parties agreed on spending $1.5 billion in
grants to states to improve prevention programs and beef up
correctional facilities for juveniles, they locked horns over a
proposal by Representative Bill McCollum, a Republican of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   McCollum's amendment, which passed, would boost gun crime
prosecutions, give prosecutors authority to try youths as adults
starting at age 13, and impose mandatory minimum sentences for a
range of gun and drug crimes, including illegal possession of a
firearm with intent to take it into a school zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids who receive little or no consequences for their
misbehavior are by far the most likely candidates for teenage
violence as they get older,'' said McCollum, whose bill requires
states to create a system to impose increasingly stiff penalities
on criminal juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   But many Democrats rejected the proposal as punitive, contending
that it would charge more youth offenders as adults and force
children to be jailed and imprisoned with violent adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is outrageous,'' complained Representative Maxine Waters,
a Democrat of California. ``This locks up 13-year-olds in the
federal system, creates new federal crimes, and takes away the
discretion of judges, doing nothing to reduce crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, the House passed by voice vote an amendment
sponsored by Representative Martin Meehan, a Lowell Democrat, to
expand a program modeled on the Boston Gun Project, which funds
law-enforcement efforts to trace guns used in youth crimes.

 &HT;    Baptists turn up heat on rhetoric
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ From a podium near midfield of the Georgia Dome,
retired football star Reggie White scored big with Southern
Baptists on Wednesday night, preaching outreach to the cities and
condemnation of homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours earlier, delegates to the annual convention of the
nation's largest Protestant denomination voted to rebuke fellow
Baptist Bill Clinton, accusing the president of endorsing the sin
of homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   As gay pride banners flew on the streets of Atlanta, the
Baptists wrapped up the business of their convention by adopting
the rebuke of Clinton that ``deplored'' his proclamation of June as
gay and lesbian pride month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even as we express great gratitude to our Lord Jesus Christ
for his forgiveness, we hereby call upon the President to rescind
his proclamation endorsing homosexuality,'' stated the resolution,
approved in an overwhelming show of hands.
</P>
<P>
   White, a former Green Bay Packers star who was greeted with a
standing ovation, did not confine his sermonizing to homosexuality.
He also implored his audience to examine the recent suburban school
shootings in Littleton, Colo., and nearby Rockdale County.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at this, ladies and gentlemen, all the kids doing
these shootings are white kids,'' he said. Shootings ``have been
happening in inner cities for years. When you allow a cancer to
start, ladies and gentlemen, it spreads.''
</P>
<P>
   White urged Southern Baptists to minister to the cities, even to
the point of taking a homeless person into their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for us to get out of the pews and into the
streets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   White quoted a string of theologians, but stuck to Bible verses
when he tackled homosexuality, using texts from Leviticus and
Romans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never criticized the gay lifestyle,'' White told a
cheering crowd. ``I've only proclaimed what God himself said.''
</P>
<P>
   Messengers to the convention praised White's speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was awesome,'' said Art Fulks, a music minister
in Rock Mountain, N.C. ``He based what he said on the word of God,
not just on what he thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching the nation's cities has been a major thrust of this
year's meeting, which drew 11,000 messengers to the Dome. The
Southern Baptist Convention claims 15.7 million members in 40,800
churches throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Convention president Rev. Paige Patterson, who was re-elected
Tuesday, has proposed an extensive ministry that will start new
churches in cities outside the traditional Bible belt, buy property
for missions in Manhattan and establish a television super-station
for outreach.
</P>
<P>
   But drawing national attention was the Southern Baptists'
dealing with the issue of homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sick and tired of the political machinery of the White
House advancing the homosexual agenda,'' said the Rev. Wiley Drake,
a California pastor.
</P>
<P>
   At Drake's suggestion, the convention amended its resolution
rebuking Clinton to call on the president to rescind the
appointment of James Hormel, a San Francisco philanthropist and gay
rights activist, as ambassador to Luxembourg. The amendment was
approved by a 2,316 to 1,313 vote.
</P>
<P>
   A presidential proclamation issued June 11 calls ``America's
diversity our greatest strength'' and encourages all Americans to
observe gay and lesbian pride month ``with appropriate programs,
ceremonies, and activities that celebrate our diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Southern Baptists' resolution says the president's
proclamation celebrates ``abominable behavior, which is for
millions of Americans an offense to their sensibilities and an
affront to their religious heritage and convictions.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution condemns violence against gays and lesbians and
proclaims the convention's love for Clinton, a Southern Baptist
himself. But ``love compels us to rebuke him and publicly to
deplore his most public endorsement of that which is contrary to
the Word of God.''
</P>
<P>
   In other resolutions adopted Wednesday, the Baptists spoke out
against school violence, human embryonic research and ethnic
cleansing, and endorsed global missions, the changelessness of God,
prayer for public officials and Christian influence in the schools.

STOCK PRICES SOAR AS INFLATION STAYS PUT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Paced by the technology sector, which propelled the
Nasdaq market to its biggest-point gain on record, stock prices
soared Wednesday after the government reported that consumer
inflation nearly disappeared in May.
</P>
<P>
   Investors had grown increasingly fearful that continued rapid
economic growth might start to generate inflation, a concern shared
by Federal Reserve policymakers who in May announced a bias toward
raising short-term interest rates, if needed to keep prices in
check.
</P>
<P>
   Coming in contrast to expectations that the Consumer Price Index
would rise by 0.2 percent, the Labor Department's report of no
change was greeted with great relief. Some analysts who had feared
Fed policymakers, at their meeting at the end of this month, would
make the first of perhaps multiple rate increases suddenly
expressed doubts that there will be any rises.
</P>
<P>
   ``That the CPI was positive on all fronts got things going in
earnest,'' said Joseph Battipaglia, investment policy chairman at
Gruntal &AMP; Co., adding that a second factor in Wednesday's market
surge was the Oracle Corp.'s surprisingly strong sales and profit
report after the market closed on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Oracle, the biggest database software maker, jumped 7
13/16 to 32 15/16, as brokerage and bank issues joined
computer-related stocks as the day's biggest gainers.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index soared 103.16 points, or 4.27
percent, to 2,517.83, surpassing its 96.05-point jump on Feb. 11 to
claim the record as the most points ever. The percentage rise was
the biggest this year and the seventh biggest on record.
</P>
<P>
   Other major gauges also posted substantial gains _ in contrast
to their frequent tendency recently to move in opposite directions
from the Nasdaq. The Dow Jones industrial average with many
blue-chip components sensitive to the business cycle, rose 189.96
points, or 1.79 percent, to close at 10,784.95. This put it ahead
17.46 percent for the year, but it was still 2.9 percent shy of its
record of 11,107.19 reached May 13.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stock index, a benchmark for many
professional money managers, climbed 29.25 points, or 2.25 percent,
to finish at 1,330.41, putting it up 8.23 percent so far in 1999.
The index had an unprecedented string of gains of more than 20
percent a year from 1995 through 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps inspired by the U.S. performance, Mexico's chief stock
index leaped 6.2 percent, while Brazil's Bovespa was 4.12 percent
higher. European markets, which had less time to react to the CPI
and other government reports here, finished with moderate gains.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market advanced, driving interest rates down by as much
as one-tenth of a point. Most analysts said they still expected the
Federal Reserve to lift the overnight lending rate by one-quarter
point, to 5 percent, on June 30
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone kind of expects that's still to come,'' said James W.
Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management. But,
he said, the CPI report at least ``raises some doubt'' about this.
He noted, for example, that since early October bond yields have
already risen 50 percent relative to commodity prices, which have
actually retreated. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, is to discuss
monetary policy Thursday before the Joint Economic Committee of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan posted the biggest advance among the Dow 30, surging
6 points to 134. American Express, up 4 15/16, to 124, was the
third biggest contributor. Financial stocks are sensitive to
interest-rate changes, which affect lending volume, spreads between
borrowing and lending costs, holdings of derivatives and, in the
case of brokers, trading activity that tends to shrink in weak
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan climbed 5\, to 80], Citigroup 2 5/16, to 46
1/16, Merrill Lynch 5], to 72 15/16, Charles Schwab 7}, to 89[ and
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter 5 3/16, to 93 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   In technology, IBM climbed 4 13/16, to 120 11/16,
Hewlett-Packard 4 5/16, to 90}, America Online 11}, to 106{,
Microsoft 3 5-16 to 81, Ebay 13\, to 148} and Amazon.com 15 3-16,
to 111 11-16. Despite downbeat comments by some analysts, Pfizer
advanced 1 9/16, to 99[, its second straight rise following six
declines. Merck rose 1, to 68| in an otherwise restrained drug
group.
</P>
<P>
   Oil stocks and those of oil service companies were prominently
weak, with Exxon, Mobil, Texaco, Phillips each down more than a
point and Halliburton down 2\ after hitting a 52-week high and
Schlumberger down 2. Coca-Cola, which has identified production
problems related to a health scare in Europe, steadied Wednesday,
closing at 63~, up [.

 STARWOOD TO PURCHASE TRINET FOR $1.5 BILLION  &HT;     By SAM ZUCKERMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
In a bid to make it easier to get financing, TriNet Corporate
Realty Trust, a San Francisco real estate company, agreed to be
acquired by commercial mortgage lender Starwood Financial Trust for
$1.5 billion in stock and assumed debt.
<P>
   The companies said their combination will create the nation's
largest publicly traded finance company focused exclusively on
commercial real estate.
</P>
<P>
   TriNet will operate as a separately managed subsidiary of
Starwood, which is based in New York, and its 50 San Francisco
employees will keep their jobs ``for the present time,'' said
TriNet President Bill Stein.
</P>
<P>
   Starwood, whose chairman is hotel magnate Barry Sternlicht,
lends to commercial property developers.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were lukewarm about the deal. TriNet stock fell 13
cents Wednesday, to $29.19. Starwood's shares plunged $20.88, to
$34.13, but analysts said the fall was meaningless because few of
the company's shares trade on the open market. TriNet buys office
buildings and commercial properties from blue-chip corporations
such as IBM and then leases the facilities back to them. The
company does business with the pillars of corporate America, which
can negotiate low lease rates because the chances they will default
are small.
</P>
<P>
   The business requires large amounts of capital, which has become
more expensive since once-high-flying real estate investment trusts
fell out of favor with investors a year and a half ago. TriNet's
stock has fallen by about 25 percent in that period.
</P>
<P>
   Joining forces with Starwood to form a bigger, more diversified
company ``will make capital more easily available,'' Stein said.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, investors snapped up the stocks of REITs,
which sell shares to the public to finance real estate purchases.
But as property prices climbed faster than rents, anticipated
returns fell and REIT stocks collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   TriNet had its own problems, such as disappointing profits from
its moves into property development. In addition, the narrow
margins and weak profit growth of its leaseback business made it
tough to attract investors.
</P>
<P>
   The company's net income rose 15 percent in 1998, to $62.6
million. But because income was diverted to cover dividends on
newly issued preferred stock, earnings per common share fell 16
percent, to $1.91.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of TRINET17 (33954 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``The stock market looks for growth, and they were not growing,''
said Jefferies &AMP; Co. analyst James Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, hooking up with Starwood actually could raise
TriNet's cost of capital in some cases. Several credit rating
agencies, including Standard &AMP; Poor's, said they were considering
downgrading TriNet's debt because Starwood's business is riskier.

ON BLOOMSDAY, IRISH REJOICE IN `RE-JOYCING' 
</HEADLINE>
   (subs lede and 10th graf to rewrite and delete `todays' and `this
afternoon')  
(DW) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ On Bloomsday, June 16, thousands stalked the
spirit of Leopold Bloom, the newspaper advertising salesman, the
hungry relisher of innards of beasts and fowls, the cuckold, and
the Jewish outsider who is the hero of James Joyce's enormous
novel, ``Ulysses.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the people who imitated Bloom by eating Gorgonzola cheese
sandwiches at Davey Byrne's pub and bought bars of lemon soap at
Sweny's chemist shop, and climbed to the parapet of the stone tower
where the novel opens, was David Norris.
</P>
<P>
   Norris, like Bloom, is himself something of an outsider to the
culture of this overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country. Norris, 55,
is a Church of Ireland Protestant, a homosexual, a senator in the
national legislature, where he has championed gay rights for 12
years. He is also Ireland's most prominent Joycean, giving dozens
of lectures and theatrical readings annually here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Joyce chose to make his hero a Jew because that also
made him an outsider in Irish society, Norris said in an interview
that ``Bloom was an outsider, but he was an insider to readers
because his mind flows in the same way as ours do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an outsider,'' he added, ``but I'm also an insider
because now people appreciate that I have so many things in common
with them. I have a sense of humor. I perform. I make people
laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that ``Ulysses'' puzzles and intimidates many
readers and that most people in Ireland have not read the novel,
which was published in 1922. They know that it was once banned as
pornographic, and that it is a very difficult read. He said such
daunted would-be readers could overcome the kind of guilt Joyce
described in ``Ulysses'' as ``agenbite of inwit: remorse of
conscience,'' and begin to understand and enjoy the book.
</P>
<P>
   The trick to taming ``Ulysses,'' Norris said, is to skip the
many difficult or impenetrable passages, and keep reading the
narrative sections that are full of psychological drama, hopes,
fears, puns and jokes. It also helps, he said, to read the book
aloud, as poetry. That would be, in Joycean wordplay, to rejoice in
re-joycing.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom's relevance to contemporary Ireland, Norris said, is
simple: love, not hatred. In the novel, baited by a jingoist Irish
Republican in a pub, Bloom says, ``That's not life for men and
women, insult and hatred,'' ``it's the very opposite,'' ``Love says
Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, Norris said, Bloom's words applied to the sectarian
violence in Northern Ireland today. ``Instead of bloodshed,''
Norris said, ``get on with lives of ordinary decency and
tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloomsday, June 16, was the day in 1904 on which the events in
the novel take place. At Sweny's pharmacy on Lincoln Place, cakes
of lemon soap, which had cost Bloom fourpence in that shop in 1904,
were selling quickly for about $1.80. At Davey Byrne's pub on Duke
Street, gorgonzola sandwiches and a glass of Burgundy sold for
about $10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had two fellas in from the country,'' said the bartender,
Thomas B. McDonagh. ``Terrible country accents. One of them read
from `Ulysses,' one from `Finnegans Wake.' Nobody knew what they
were talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   A relevant passage from a Joyce letter about ``Ulysses,'' Norris
said, might be, ``I've put in so many enigmas and puzzles that it
will keep the professors busy for centuries arguing over what I
mean, and that's the only way of insuring one's immortality.''

 CHRONICLE PUBLISHING OFFICIALLY ON THE BLOCK  &HT;     By DAN FOST AND PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
The board of Chronicle Publishing Co. voted 9 to 0 Wednesday to
formally put the company up for sale.
<P>
   The vote came almost six weeks after the San Francisco company,
which owns The Chronicle, KRON-TV and other media properties, hired
New York investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette to ``review
and evaluate the company's financial, business and strategic
plans.''
</P>
<P>
   A source who was at the meeting said the privately held company
could fetch more than $2 billion if it were sold in pieces. John
Morton, a newspaper industry analyst based in Silver Spring, Md.,
said that figure sounded like a good estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding is expected to take most of the summer, executives said,
and it probably will be late this year or early next year before
any sales are completed.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the company has not formally solicited offers, DLJ
reported that several media companies already have expressed
interest in buying various parts of Chronicle Publishing.
</P>
<P>
   Gannett Co. of Arlington, Va.; Hollinger Inc. of Toronto;
Journal Register Co. of Trenton, N.J.; Knight Ridder Inc. of San
Jose; and Times Mirror Co. of Los Angeles reportedly have expressed
interest in buying the company's three newspapers. In addition to
San Francisco daily, Chronicle Publishing owns the Worcester
Telegram &AMP; Gazette in Massachusetts and the Bloomington Pantagraph
in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times Co., which bought the Boston Globe in 1993
for $1 billion, reportedly is interested in the Worcester paper.
Copley Newspapers expressed interest in the Bloomington paper.
</P>
<P>
   Knight Ridder Chairman and CEO Tony Ridder confirmed Wednesday
that his company, which publishes the San Jose Mercury News and the
Contra Costa Times, would be interested in buying all the
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're strong in the South Bay and East Bay but don't have much
circulation in San Mateo, San Francisco or Marin,'' he said,
``Those areas and Alameda are served by The Chronicle, and they're
great markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton said Knight Ridder might face antitrust hurdles if it
tried to buy The Chronicle. ``I don't think the Justice Department
would ever let that one go by,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ridder said that after consulting lawyers, he disagrees. He
also said Knight Ridder would be interested in The Chronicle
despite its joint operating agreement with the San Francisco
Examiner, which is owned by New York's Hearst Corp.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of CHRON17 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Under the JOA, which continues into 2005, The Chronicle and
Examiner maintain separate news operations but jointly operate all
production, advertising, circulation and other noneditorial
activities. The two owners share revenues and expenses 50-50, even
though The Chronicle's circulation is more than four times the
Examiner's.
</P>
<P>
   A source at the McClatchy Co., which publishes the Sacramento
Bee, said the JOA discouraged that company from pursuing a bid for
The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   NBC, Fox Television, USA Network and Young Broadcasting Inc.
have expressed preliminary interest in buying KRON, the NBC
affiliate in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks Muse has expressed interest in buying all the company's TV
properties, which also include San Francisco cable station BayTV;
ABC affiliate KAKE in Wichita, Kan.; and NBC affiliate WOWT in
Omaha, Neb.
</P>
<P>
   Television stations are selling for increasingly higher prices.
Last year, Hearst-Argyle Corp., Hearst's television arm, set a
record with the $520 million purchase of KCRA and two smaller
properties in Sacramento, the nation's 20th-largest market. The San
Francisco Bay Area is No.5 in market size.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers say the company is not likely to be sold in one
piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to imagine a single buyer interested in all
properties,'' said Nion McEvoy, a board member, shareholder and
editor in chief of Chronicle Books, one of the company's two
book-publishing divisions. The other is MBI, a Wisconsin publisher
of transportation books.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Also, federal rules prohibit one company from owning a
newspaper and a television station in the same community.
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle Publishing was exempted from the rule because it went
into effect after the company already owned KRON and The Chronicle.
Industry observers say the Federal Communication Commission
probably would not let a new owner buy both properties.
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle Publishing, which also operates the SF Gate.com Web
site, employs a total of 3,200 people.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Cuthbertson, executive officer of the Northern California
Media Guild, the union that represents about 350 Chronicle
employees, said he wasn't surprised by Wednesday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of CHRON17 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``All of our concerns remain about jobs and our contract,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   By next month, qualified prospective buyers who sign
confidentiality agreements will be given a look at each operation's
financial data, according to an informed source.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle is the 11th-largest daily newspaper in the
country, with a circulation of 482,268.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst has expressed interest in buying The Chronicle but not
the other properties, according to a source. Under the JOA, Hearst
has the right of first refusal to buy The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at both the Examiner and Chronicle said yesterday
that they did not know whether that right would hold up if all of
Chronicle Publishing was sold.
</P>
<P>
   At the Chronicle meeting, DLJ representatives handed board
members dark green folders containing financial analyses and sale
options.
</P>
<P>
   The paper is owned by roughly three dozen descendants of
Chronicle co-founder M.H. de Young.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the 10 board members are shareholders, and the others
are outside directors. One family director was absent yesterday as
the board gathered in the company's wood-paneled conference room
under the gaze of the formal portraits of previous publishers.
</P>
<P>
   One major shareholder and former director, Nan T. McEvoy, had
repeatedly advocated keeping the 134-year-old company in family
hands. But she reportedly has ``accepted the inevitable,''
according to one source.
</P>
<P>
   As she left the meeting, McEvoy said only, ``We'll see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The board decided to sell for several reasons, according to
company spokesman Don Solem. The economy is strong, media companies
are fetching high prices, the Bay Area is growing in importance
thanks to Silicon Valley and its perch on the Pacific Rim, and
Chronicle Publishing has a diverse set of assets that could bring
more money separately than together.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Solem said, many of the shareholders are four or
five generations removed from the founders of the newspaper. None
are involved in active management of any of the operating units,
and only a handful are even employed by the company, a big change
from past generations.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 3 of CHRON17 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``All of those things add up to: The time to sell is now,'' Solem
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After years of speculation on this, the future of newspapers
in San Francisco is moving to a fairly quick resolution,'' said Tom
Goldstein, dean of the Columbia University School of Journalism in
New York. If Hearst buys The Chronicle, it likely would merge it
with the Examiner or close one of the two papers. ``The trend
toward one-newspaper towns is absolutely unmistakable over the
years. There are so few left as to be almost statistically
negligible.''

SERIAL KILLER IS PURSUED IN TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Ky., Mexico)  (nk) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In a search described as akin to looking for ``a
needle in five haystacks,'' hundreds of federal, state and local
law-enforcement officers in Texas are hunting a serial killer
believed responsible for the fatal bludgeoning of six people on or
near railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The chief suspect in the killings _ five in the last six months
between Houston and San Antonio, the other nearly two years ago in
Kentucky _ is Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, a drifter from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The similarities in the cases, investigators say, suggest the
same killer: All six victims were savagely beaten with blunt
objects. Most were then covered with a blanket or a sheet. In at
least three cases, the killer fled by stealing a car from the
victim, although he shows no apparent interest in robbery.
</P>
<P>
   But the common thread that has instilled the greatest sense of
fear and vulnerability in South Texas railroad communities is that
the killings all occurred near the tracks, as if the attacker had
hopped off a train and randomly searched for someone to murder.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez, described by officials as a transient who has
spent much of the last decade jumping freight trains from Vermont
to California, has not been charged with any of the killings. But
officials say fingerprints in at least three cases, and additional
evidence that they decline to describe, link him to all six deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his habit of staying on the move, and because the
authorities' most recent photograph of him is four years old, the
challenge of finding Resendez-Ramirez is formidable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like trying to find a needle in five haystacks,'' said
Ron Walker, a Houston police lieutenant. Earlier this week dozens
of investigators combed hundreds of railroad cars in Brazoria
County, south of Houston, in a search that netted 21 people
suspected of being illegal immigrants, but not Resendez-Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent clue came on Saturday, when officers in Del Rio,
a border town, found the abandoned white Honda Civic of a Houston
schoolteacher, Noemi Dominguez, who was discovered beaten to death
in her home on June 5. Wednesday the Houston police announced that
the fingerprints of Resendez-Ramirez had been found in the car.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators concede that little is known of Resendez-Ramirez.
He was born in Puebla, about 115 miles south of Mexico City, and is
39, the investigators say. Because of frequent illegal forays into
the United States, he has spent time in federal prisons on
immigration charges, although his past does not appear to indicate
violence. He has used several aliases during the last decade as he
hopped freight trains across the United States. The Mexican
authorities have interviewed a former wife living in Juarez, but
finding relatives or friends has been difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a traveler,'' said Mike Cox, a spokesman for the Texas
Department of Public Safety, noting that law-enforcement agents had
been able to place him at various times over the last 10 years in
Michigan, Vermont, California, Missouri, Kentucky and Louisiana. As
a result, officials in a number of states are sifting through
unsolved murder cases, checking in particular any near railroad
tracks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The six victims seem to have had little in common other than
their proximity to the rails. The first, Christopher Maier, a
student at the University of Kentucky, was killed in August 1997 as
he walked along the tracks in Lexington, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last December, Dr. Claudia Benton of West University
Place, an affluent incorporated city within the boundaries of
Houston, was found sexually assaulted, stabbed and beaten to death
inside her home near the tracks. Her Jeep Cherokee was later found
abandoned in San Antonio, and officials say a fingerprint of the
suspect was found in the car.
</P>
<P>
   The other slayings have all occurred since April 30, when a
minister and his wife, Norman and Karen Sirnic, were discovered
dead inside their home near the tracks in the small town of Weimar.
Their stolen pickup was later discovered in nearby San Antonio.
Then Josephine Konvicka, 73, was found slain on June 4 inside her
home in Fayette County, west of Houston, and a day later the body
of Ms. Dominguez, the schoolteacher, was found in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   While investigators have yet to determine any motive for the
killings, they suspect that they are racing the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most serious case going on in Texas,'' Cox said.
``There's concern that whoever is doing these killings could kill
again.''

 N.Y. MEDIA PUNCHING EACH OTHER WITH GLOVED FISTS ONLINE  &HT;     By DAN FOST 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
New York _ In two days in Manhattan, I did it all: Ate chopped
liver drizzled with schmaltz at Sammy's Romanian Steak House, saw a
rat scurry through Gramercy Park, toured Theodore Roosevelt's
birthplace, rode out the heat wave in new and old taxis, and
visited three of the top purveyors of online financial news.
<P>
   I'm sorry to report that none of the editors at the Wall Street
Journal Interactive Edition, TheStreet.com or the New York bureau
of CBS Marketwatch.com could spin a story like the yarn my cabbie
told about his run-ins with in-line skaters, cops, judges and
bosses.
</P>
<P>
   But the Wall Street scribes did offer some entertaining tales _
like how none of them sees the others as direct competition, even
though they seem compelled to take pokes at one another.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers, after all, love a fight, and New York's status as a
financial and media capital is fomenting a first-class brawl as the
relatively new online medium builds up momentum.
</P>
<P>
   TheStreet, for instance, is the scrappy underdog that started a
mere three years ago. Its pungent commentary contrasts with the
authoritative air of the Journal's online edition, and its emphasis
on analysis makes it different from the data-intensive day-trading
paradise at Marketwatch.com.
</P>
<P>
   TheStreet's feisty editor, Dave Kansas, was a Journal reporter
for four years before jumping into the online world. He relishes
his niche as a pesky thorn in his old employer's side.
</P>
<P>
   ``The franchise of financial journalism is theirs to lose,''
Kansas said. ``It's hard to get better than the best. Each person
working to chip away at them is a terrible nuisance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Journal's top newspaper competition, the New York Times, has
even endorsed TheStreet's endeavors _ not only with a $15 million
investment, but, according to the latest filings, with plans to
create ``a jointly owned newsroom to provide continuous coverage of
business news.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas wouldn't discuss the plans for the joint venture, which
sources said would take shape by the fourth quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   He did, however, offer his commentary on the ties of
Marketwatch, based in San Francisco, to another big New York media
firm, CBS: ``I'm glad we're not locked into a large television
network like they are. We have a lot of options open to us. We can
do anything with anyone. They have a lot of obligations to such a
bigfoot daddy like that.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of MEDIA17 (91283 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Uptown, where Marketwatch maintains several desks in CBS's 57th
Street offices, New York bureau chief Emily Church was mystified by
Kansas' comments. ``I've never felt constrained because we're part
of the Tiffany network,'' Church said. ``I don't see how you can
say it hurt us. We had a huge IPO, and we have a huge, huge
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   With a small staff operating in the dimly lit, brick-walled
offices of CBS's new media operations, Church says Marketwatch can
offer both expert commentary on general financial news to deliver
on the CBS Evening News as well as sophisticated, technical reports
on its Web site on topics like the bond market.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal claims it's above the fray. The online Journal,
which occupies the same floor in the Dow Jones office tower as the
august print product's newsroom, doesn't even call itself a
financial Web site. Managing Editor Rich Jaroslovsky prefers the
term ``business publication,'' saying, ``We're not aimed at the
narrow world of finance, but at the broader world of business.''
</P>
<P>
   But with increasing numbers of Web surfers turning to
non-journalistic sites like Schwab and Yahoo Finance for
information, Jaroslovsky acknowledged that competition does exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire Web is our competition,'' Jaroslovsky said. ``We
have to be that much deeper and more authoritative than all the
things you can get for free.''
</P>
<P>
   The Journal site is envied in the online world for its 300,000
paying subscribers. The more expensive service of TheStreet.com, by
comparison, is considered successful with only 51,000 paying
subscribers as of March 31, according to its latest prospectus,
filed last month. (The interactive Journal is available for $29 a
year to subscribers of the print product and $59 to all others.
TheStreet costs $99.95 a year, and MarketWatch is free.)
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, it should be noted that the sites all praised each
other: Church admired TheStreet founder Jim Cramer's columns,
Kansas hailed Marketwatch reporters who post two to three stories a
day (as many as his staffers file in a week), and everyone conceded
that all sites do their own things very well.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of MEDIA17 (91283 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Could the mutual admiration be a reflection of Rudy Giuliani's
more civil New York? It reminds me of another Manhattan cab ride I
had: a new Crown Victoria, air-conditioned, jazz music playing and
a silent driver. It may be more pleasant, but it's not as colorful
as the old system.
</P>
<P>
   MEDIA MONEY ONLY, PLEASE: Imagine throwing a media conference
and not inviting the media.
</P>
<P>
   That was the conundrum at the Pierre Hotel last week, where the
newly merged Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown hosted a media and
telecommunications conference.
</P>
<P>
   Media firms like Marketwatch.com, Cnet and Knight Ridder sent
their executives to peddle their companies to deep-pocketed
investors, but they couldn't send their reporters to report the
stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the few conferences we have that is closed to
the press,'' said Chris Cortezi, who handles publicity for Alex.
Brown analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the analysts had invited journalists,'' said Cortezi,
who had the unenviable job of dis-inviting them. ``Some were
understanding, and some were not,'' she said.

 SOFTWARE INDUSTRY SEES RECORD GROWTH  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
U.S software sales increased 17.8 percent to a record $141.9
billion last year and the industry now employs 806,900 people
nationwide, according to a study released Wednesday.
<P>
   The software industry should become the biggest contributor to
the U.S. economy of all manufacturing industries by next year,
accelerating past the century-old automobile industry, according to
the Business Software Alliance report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The software industry has emerged as one of the
fastest-growing and most vibrant segments of the U.S. economy,''
BSA President Robert Holleyman said during a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The trade association used the report to punctuate the third day
of a technology industry blitz on Washington, D.C. The majordomos
of leading tech companies such as Microsoft and Intel have huddled
with Capitol Hill legislators and the Clinton administration,
stressing the economic and political importance of their
industries.
</P>
<P>
   To release the report, the alliance trotted out 13 CEOs from its
top member companies, including Bill Gates of Microsoft, Carol
Bartz of Autodesk Inc., John Chen of Sybase, Bill Harris of Intuit
and William Larson of Network Associates.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executives said legislators are more aware than ever
of the key issues on high-tech industry's agenda, from encryption
to software piracy.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the industry's top issue, the Senate passed a bill
this week that would limit lawsuits caused by Year 2000 computer
problems, though the White House has threatened a veto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress is listening to this industry very well,'' Gates said
at the press conference. ``I'm pleased with the dialogue and I'm
pleased with the interest level. It's related to the fact we're
creating a number of good jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, prepared by Nathan Associates Inc., said software
industry employment grew 13.9 percent annually from 1994 to 1998,
which compares to an annual growth rate of only 2.5 percent for all
of private industry combined.
</P>
<P>
   The average salary for software workers is $68,900 per year,
compared with $29,800 for other private sector workers.
</P>
<P>
   If the current trend continues, the industry will have more than
1.3 million workers by 2008, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Bartz, though, said illegally copied software cost the industry
$11 billion in lost potential revenue and prevented the creation of
32,700 jobs last year. If that rate continues, the industry would
lose 52,700 new jobs by 2008, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance is pushing for stronger copyright protection laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an area where we require help,'' Bartz said.

BENEDICT IS THE METS' MAD HATTER FOR A DAY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ On a day that Bruce Benedict was, in a sense, asked
to wear an entirely different hat as the temporary manager of the
Mets, it made little difference that Benedict forgot his cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I had a little trouble with my hat,'' Benedict said,
betraying the nerves he surely felt Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It was about the only difficulty Benedict had in his star turn
as the stand-in for Manager Bobby Valentine, who was serving the
first game of a two-game suspension. With Valentine watching in
suit jacket and tie from a box above home plate, Benedict guided
the Mets to a 5-2 victory over the Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   As Valentine sat with Phillips and Assistant General Manager
Omar Minaya in full view of the Mets' dugout, Brian McRae drove in
three runs, Robin Ventura homered and Masato Yoshii (6-5) pitched
six solid innings before four relievers closed it out. John Franco
tossed a perfect ninth to record his 16th save in 17 tries this
season. And the Mets (35-30) have now won eight of their past 10
games since General Manager Steve Phillips fired three of
Valentine's coaches following the Mets' season-high eighth straight
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict, the Mets' bench coach, was spared Phillips' purge. He
stepped in when Valentine was banished for donning a fake mustache
and sunglasses and remaining in the dugout tunnel after he had been
ejected June 9.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict takes over as manager when Valentine is ejected. But
Wednesday he managed his first major league game from beginning to
end, and he was so nervous that he emerged from the clubhouse
without a hat. When he ran back to his locker, he picked out the
one the Mets use for batting practice. It was not until the fourth
inning, Benedict said, that Charlie Samuels, the Mets' equipment
manager, brought him a regular game cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he was a little nervous,'' Valentine said of Benedict.
``I was nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   It helped that the Mets took an early lead and never fell
behind.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura helped contribute to the Mets' first four runs. After
Mike Piazza opened the second with a double to extend his hitting
streak to 19 games _ matching his career best _ Ventura moved
Piazza to third by grounding out to the right side of the infield.
McRae singled Piazza home, and the Mets led, 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura then led off the fourth against Steve Parris (4-1) with
his 11th home run of the season, before the Reds answered with
single runs in the fourth and fifth to tie the score at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Then Piazza reached first on Aaron Boone's error at third to
open the sixth. Ventura moved Piazza to third when he was credited
with an Astroturf double that bounced over center fielder Mike
Cameron's head. And both runners scored on a single to right by
McRae, who stumbled rounding first. The Mets led, 4-2, but McRae
felt a whiplash effect in his neck, and was thrown out at second as
he banged his sore left knee on the slide.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii worked his way out of jams in the fifth and sixth
innings. In the fifth, he picked Cameron off second, in one of the
game's key plays. Had Yoshii not, the Reds might have gone on to
take the lead instead of merely tie. Then, with the Reds trailing,
4-2, the red-hot Sean Casey singled to lead off the critical sixth.
Against Greg Vaughn, who belted 50 homers a year ago, Yoshii fell
behind three balls and no strikes. The pitching coach Dave Wallace
made his way to the mound to buy Greg McMichael some time in the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii threw a fastball. Vaughn grounded into a double play.
Barry Larkin grounded out. End of threat.
</P>
<P>
   Then Benedict went to his bullpen, just as he and Valentine had
planned. McMichael and Dennis Cook pitched the seventh, with Cook
stranding a runner on third. Cook and Armando Benitez pitched the
eighth, with Benitez stranding a runner on first.
</P>
<P>
   In the top of the ninth, Edgardo Alfonzo singled home Matt
Franco with an insurance run. In the bottom of the ninth, John
Franco came on for the save, and Alfonzo helped out again with a
sensational, leaping stab of an Eddie Taubensee liner for the
second out. Then McRae ran down a Cameron liner to deep center, bad
knee and all, before doing what Benedict said looked like a
Spiderman impersonation on the center-field fence, as he held on to
the game's final out.
</P>
<P>
   What was it like playing for Benedict instead of Valentine?
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I noticed was that it was real quiet in the
dugout,'' Yoshii said through his translator. ``That's when I
noticed Bobby wasn't there.''

SENATOR VOWS TO NOTE DONATIONS IN DEBATES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hoping to breathe some life into moribund campaign
finance legislation, Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., announced
Wednesday that in debates on legislation favored by interest
groups, he would make a point of identifying how much money those
groups had given to candidates and parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campaign contributions are involved in virtually everything
that this body does,'' Feingold declared in a Senate speech. ``We
cannot just pull our head out of the sand to discuss the influence
of money on the legislative process once a year when we take up
campaign finance legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   With Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., Feingold is the chief Senate
sponsor of legislation that, among other steps, would outlaw the
unregulated contributions, or soft money, that businesses and labor
unions give to political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the measure, backed by almost all Democrats and a few
Republicans, won support of a majority of the members of the House
and Senate, but it died in a Republican-led filibuster in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois has said the House will not
take up the legislation until September, and the Senate will
probably not deal with it until the House has acted. Even then,
there is no indication that the bill can get the 60 votes necessary
to overcome a filibuster.

SOTHEBY'S ENTERS ALLIANCE WITH AMAZON.COM TO SELL ART AND
COLLECTIBLES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROL VOGEL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Five months after announcing a $25 million plan to
begin its own online auction business, Sotheby's has entered into
an alliance with Amazon.com to begin selling art and collectibles
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement, announced Wednesday, combines Amazon's online
expertise and broad customer reach with Sotheby's reputation as an
authority in the business of selling fine and decorative arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are bringing to the table technology, customer service and
an introduction to 10 million people,'' said Jeffrey P. Bezos, the
founder and chief executive of Amazon.com. ``One of the biggest
problems in the online auction business is the ability to
authenticate what we sell, and that's something Sotheby's can help
us do. There's no other partner out there that could help us build
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon is also hoping to tap into Sotheby's large international
data base of collectors.
</P>
<P>
   By working together, Sotheby's and Amazon are trying to
strengthen their positions in the fast-growing and highly
competitive field of online auctions. In January, Christie's, the
Rockefeller Center auction house and Sotheby rival, announced that
it, too, would start an online auction site, Christies.com. It will
begin conducting online sales in September. Christie's, which is
owned by Pinault-Printemps-Redoute of France, is said to be in
negotiations with other online companies to form an alliance
similar to that of Amazon-Sotheby's, but a spokeswoman at
Christie's would say only that it was going ahead with its site as
planned.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the auction site Ebay bought Butterfield &AMP;
Butterfield, the San Francisco-based auctioneers, for $260 million.
Ebay is also said to have discussed some kind of partnership with
both Sotheby's and Christie's, but people close to both auction
houses said those talks had ended.
</P>
<P>
   On a smaller scale, Artnet.com, a high-end portal devoted to
selling artwork on line, went public in Germany last month. ``We
see the Sotheby's-Amazon deal not as art world news but as an
attempt by Amazon to compete with Ebay,'' said Hans Neuendorf,
chairman of Artnet. ``For Sotheby's, it's a way to expand into
low-priced collectibles.''
</P>
<P>
   Bezos disagreed with those remarks. ``That's not true,'' he
said. ``We're trying to create a whole new auction site, one that
makes sense for valuable objects. The point is to break new ground
selling fully authenticated, fully guaranteed objects on line using
Sotheby's experts around the world and its network of more than
2,800 dealers.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Amazon will invest $35 million in the
Manhattan auction house, or less than 2 percent of Sotheby's. It
has agreed to buy one million shares of class A common stock at
about $35 each and is buying a warrant for $10 million that
entitles it to buy one million more shares of Sotheby's class A for
$100 each. Shares of Sotheby's rose $4.125 Wednesday, to $39.25,
while Amazon.com rose $15.1875, to $111.6875.
</P>
<P>
   Three different auction sites will be available by clicking on
Amazon.com or Sothebys.com. Amazon will keep its three-month-old
amazon.com/auctions, which sells everything from washing machines
to Andy Warhol paintings to a $75,000 space capsule. Anyone can buy
and sell on this site, but Amazon will guarantee purchases only up
to $250.
</P>
<P>
   A joint site, sothebys.amazon.com, will offer all areas of
collectibles, from coins and jewelry to porcelains and Barbie
dolls, but sellers will be only professional dealers and they will
be responsible for guaranteeing the objects they sell. The third
site, sothebys.com, will sell the more traditional auction-house
fare, such as paintings, furniture and decorative objects. For this
site, the seller, whether it is a dealer or Sotheby's, will
guarantee all the property.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't thought of these different sites as having
different price points but rather each having different and special
characters,'' said Diana D. Brooks, Sotheby's chief executive.
``Now dealers from around the world will be able to offer their
property to an unlimited number of potential bidders, and buyers
will be able to participate in some of the most exciting online
auctions.''
</P>
<P>
   Participation will not simply be on line. In April, Amazon
acquired Livebid.com, a provider of live auctions on the Internet.
Bezos said it would begin broadcasting some of Sotheby's auctions.
Bidders will be able to see the items on their computer screens,
read the descriptions and bid while an auction takes place.

FOR THE U.S. OPEN, GOLFERS ARE GIDDY OVER PINEHURST
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ In the opinion of many players, the U. S. Open
Championship is being played at a perfect site this year.
</P>
<P>
   The fairways are wide enough to enable players to use their
drivers. The three-inch rough is high enough to create difficult
shots, but low enough to give players options. The sloping
turtle-back greens will put a premium on the short game and force
players to be creative.
</P>
<P>
   The overall challenge of the Pinehurst Resort and Country Club's
No. 2 course, one of the world's most revered, creates a special
atmosphere: a national treasure will be playing host to the
national championship for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The 99th U.S. Open, which begins Thursday, should present a fair
yet difficult test. The winner will need imagination, short-game
skill, patience and a few good breaks. Expect an unpredictable
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   If the weather is wet and the greens are soft, the winning score
could be 6-under par or lower. But if the greens remain firm, and
if there is even the slightest breeze, the winning score could
easily soar over par. So get ready to see a different Open, with
players putting with 3-woods from off the green, players using
every club in their bag and a large group of players starting the
tournament with a legitimate chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   After three days of practice _ and hearing so much about the
nuances of Pinehurst and the genius of the course architect Donald
Ross _ the players have given their stamp of approval. But loving
Pinehurst is easy. To win at Pinehurst will be far more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is in agreement that it's going to be a fantastic
Open,'' Greg Norman, who will be playing in his 17th U.S. Open,
said. ``They've done a phenomenal job in the setup of the golf
course. This is the best I've seen and that's pretty much the word
on the driving range and the putting green.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be more of an international Open. A lot more
players could win this golf tournament than we've seen in the past.
Before, the U.S. Open was conservative; the driver wasn't in your
bag. This week, you're hitting a lot of drivers, plus medium iron
shots into the greens. And if you miss the greens, you've got a
variety of different shots, anywhere from putting with your 3-wood
to putting with your putter to using an iron.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys who grew up in Europe, the guys who grew up in
Australia and the U.S. guys have all played these type of courses
before. So it's more of an open Open.''
</P>
<P>
   No European has won the U.S. Open since Tony Jacklin in 1970,
but many believe that could change this weekend. Colin Montgomerie
of Scotland, who endured heart-breaking second-place finishes in
the 1994 and 1997 Open, agreed that Europeans like himself _ Lee
Westwood and the Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal _ could fare
well. Chipping and putting is also important at the Masters, where
Europeans have won 11 of the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's motivation for every European golfer,''
Montgomerie said of the dry spell at the Open. ``I think it's been
too long. Nick Faldo has lost in playoffs. So have I. It's a matter
of trying to walk through when that door is half ajar, and not
finishing second.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, one of the beauties of Pinehurst is that not everyone
agrees on what will happen. Westwood did not buy the theory that
Europeans have a better chance this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing like this course in Europe,'' Westwood, the
world's eighth-ranked player, said. ``I don't know why somebody has
the impression it's going to suit the European player. That's just
a proviso in case one of us wins.''
</P>
<P>
   But the list of favorites is a long one. Tiger Woods is playing
his best golf in two years, having won his last two starts. David
Duval, who burned his right thumb and forefinger on a pot last
week, has been able to practice since Tuesday, and he expects to
play well.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Janzen, the defending champion, has won the Open twice, and
he has the toughness and temperament to do it again. The same could
be said for Ernie Els, another two-time U.S. Open champion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But there are several keys to winning. Driving the ball
accurately will still be important, because it will be difficult to
land approach shots from the rough onto the green with consistency.
Avoiding three-putts at any tournament is crucial, particularly at
the majors. Avoiding big-number holes will also be important.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to make a big number at Pinehurst is to miss any
green in the wrong spot, particularly past the pin, thus leaving an
impossible chip shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the rough cut to three inches, the players may be tempted
to hit a long shot toward the putting green, with little or no
control over the golf ball,'' Trey Holland, chairman of the U.S.
Golf Association championship committee, said. ``Where it ends up
is going to be anybody's guess. We think it's going to result in a
very exciting championship, something the fans and players have not
experienced with a U.S. Open setup for years.''
</P>
<P>
   And the players can hardly wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be fun,'' Curtis Strange, a two-time Open
champion, said. ``We're playing a little bit in the unknown. But
it's going to be a ball.''

 BofA Hedges On Vow to Not Share Clients' Data  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Bank of America said Wednesday that its ban on sharing information
about customers with third-party marketers will be less complete
than it previously said.
<P>
   Last week, amid a brewing storm over banks giving telemarketing
firms information on customer spending patterns and other personal
data, the North Carolina bank said it would not provide ``any
customer information'' to ``third-party marketers.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, spokesman John Cleghorn said the bank will make some
exceptions, such as providing account information to companies that
call customers at home to sell insurance. He said the outsiders
will be acting as the bank's ``agents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In some instances, we may contract with outside companies,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cleghorn insisted that there is no contradiction between BofA's
earlier pronouncement and such exceptions. He said outside
marketers will only sell financial products that the bank by law
can't provide. And BofA will require its marketers to use customer
data only to sell products on the bank's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   BofA's clarification puts its policy in line with Wells Fargo,
which last week said it, too, would end some information-sharing
with telemarketing firms but continue providing data to companies
selling insurance over the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Sutro &AMP; Co. analyst Campbell Chaney noted that banks may have no
alternative to using outside vendors if they want to sell insurance
to customers. ``It's not surprising that there was less to BofA's
policy than met the eye,'' he said.

 WILLIAMS-SONOMA TO SELL WARES ON EPICURIOUS SITE  &HT;     By CAROL EMERT 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Williams-Sonoma Inc. of San Francisco has signed a multiyear
agreement to sell cookware over CondeNet's Epicurious Web site, a
leading online food site.
<P>
   The agreement with CondeNet, an affiliate of New York publisher
Conde Nast Inc., is a ``baby step'' toward a broader relationship
between the two companies, said Pat Connolly, Williams-Sonoma
executive vice president. ``We believe there is a race to build a
dominant lifestyle portal for the upscale woman ... and CondeNet
wants to work with us on it,'' Connolly said.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies are discussing possible additional
partnerships, such as between Pottery Barn, Williams-Sonoma's
home-furnishings business, and Conde Nast publications like House &AMP;
Garden or Architectural Digest.
</P>
<P>
   Epicurious, which CondeNet launched almost five years ago at
www.food.epicurious.com has spawned a successful cooking show on
cable TV. Epicurious includes original content and repackaged
material from Conde Nast's Bon Appetit and Gourmet magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, CondeNet and Time Warner agreed to create a cable and
Web business targeted at upscale women. Williams-Sonoma expects to
be be involved in both of these projects.
</P>
<P>
   The deal announced Wednesday goes beyond a typical ``affiliate''
relationship, in which businesses install hyperlinks or a store on
a partner's site. Links to the digital checkout counter on
Williams-Sonoma's site will be interspersed throughout Epicurious.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a page containing a cake recipe might list links to
buy cocoa powder, vanilla beans and pans. An article about Spanish
cooking utensils might include a link to a paella pan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make it very easy for them to buy and (immediately)
go back to Epicurious,'' Connolly said.
</P>
<P>
   For CondeNet, the partnership is ``a way to make the site full
service,'' adding product sales to the recipes and other
information Epicurious offers, said Sarah Chubb, director of
CondeNet.
</P>
<P>
   CondeNet will get a cut of sales, though details about the
financial arrangement were not released.
</P>
<P>
   CondeNet will maintain complete editorial control over the site.
Chubb said coverage of cookware will not be influenced by
Williams-Sonoma, but there is no contractual agreement that
prevents such conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Williams-Sonoma is still developing a full-line cyber store,
which it expects to open in October, and the Epicurious links will
go up simultaneously. Williams-Sonoma launched its first major
site, a wedding registry, earlier this month at www.wswedding.com.
Pottery Barn is expected to follow early next year.
</P>
<P>
   CondeNet and Conde Nast are subsidiaries of Advance
Publications.

ARCHER DANIELS EXECUTIVE SAID TO DISCLOSE PRICE-FIXING TALKS WITH
CARGILL COUNTERPART  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ A senior executive at the Archer Daniels Midland Co.
told government investigators that he had held secret talks with an
executive at Cargill Inc. to rig bids and prices in a huge food
additive market, according to recently released documents.
</P>
<P>
   The Archer Daniels executive, Barrie R. Cox, told federal
officials that in the early 1990s he had spoken more than a dozen
times with the Cargill executive, William M. Gruber, ``about what
each would be bidding on specific accounts'' in the sale of citric
acid to giant food and consumer product companies. Citric acid is
an additive used in everything from soft drinks to detergents.
</P>
<P>
   According to records of two interviews in 1996 and 1997, which
were recently made public as part of a related criminal case, Cox
told investigators that he believed Gruber, formerly the head of
national sales of citric acid at Cargill, might have been acting
without the knowledge of other Cargill officials.
</P>
<P>
   Government prosecutors have said that Cargill did not take part
with Archer Daniels and three other companies _ the Haarmann &AMP;
Reimer Corp. of Springfield, N.J., Hoffman-LaRoche Inc., a division
of Roche Holdings in Switzerland and Jungbunzlauer Inc. of Austria
_ in a much broader international conspiracy. That scheme involved
regular meetings in the early 1990s to illegally fix prices in the
citric acid market. The four companies eventually paid more than
$100 million to settle government charges of illegal price-fixing.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said last week that it was not
investigating Cargill or Gruber at this time.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox statements could play a significant role in an appeal of
a class-action suit against Cargill, filed by purchasers of citric
acid who claim they were cheated by the company. Earlier this week,
lawyers for the purchasers filed a motion citing the Cox statements
as grounds for overturning a dismissal of the case for lack of
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Cox said in interviews with federal prosecutors that between
1992 and 1995 he and Gruber worked together to rig bids on the sale
of citric acid to giant U.S. companies. The interviews were
conducted under a federal order that granted Cox immunity but did
not shield him from criminal prosecution for making false or
misleading statements.
</P>
<P>
   Cargill officials vehemently denied any suggestion that the
company or Gruber took part in bid rigging or price-fixing. Richard
J. Favretto, an attorney for Cargill, called Cox's statements
``wholly unsubstantiated'' and said that after a thorough,
four-year investigation of the citric acid market, the Justice
Department had taken no action against Cargill or any of its
employees. Cargill officials said Gruber declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Cargill also released a letter it secured upon request last week
from Phillip H. Warren, assistant chief of the Justice Department's
antitrust division, which said that ``Cargill Inc. and William M.
Gruber are neither targets of, nor currently under investigation
in, the antitrust division's investigation of possible criminal
antitrust violations in the citric acid industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials confirmed that they had sent the
letter but declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Archer Daniels, Cargill and the three other makers of citric
acid were also accused in the class-action suit of conspiring to
fix the price of citric acid. Cox told investigators that he and
Gruber discussed the bids for Coca-Cola, Mars, Procter &AMP; Gamble and
Phillip Morris' Kraft Foods division. Coca-Cola and Mars are part
of the class-action suit. Procter &AMP; Gamble and Kraft are not.
</P>
<P>
   Archer Daniels and the three other companies agreed to pay $94
million to settle the class-action suit in 1996. But Cargill
refused to join the settlement, saying it was not part of the
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   The class-action suit proceeded against Cargill. But early last
year, before these FBI documents were available, a federal judge
dismissed the case on the grounds that there was not enough
evidence to bring it to trial.
</P>
<P>
   The case is now before a federal appellate court in San
Francisco. Earlier this week the plaintiffs filed a motion to
include the record of the FBI interviews with Cox as evidence.
Notes of the interviews were released this winter in connection
with the sentencing of three Archer Daniels executives who were
convicted last September in a Federal price-fixing trial.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, who was a key prosecution witness in that trial, is now a
consultant for Archer Daniels Cox declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   In the records, which are Federal Bureau of Investigation notes
of the interview, Cox says that he often arranged bids with Gruber
and that ``these discussions usually occurred toward the end of the
year, when contracts came up for renewal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They would talk about `x' being a good price for an account,''
he says in the records.
</P>
<P>
   Cox also told investigators that ``the effect of the Gruber-Cox
conversations is that Cargill and ADM would bid at close to the
same price, but not the identical price, as that would look
suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the records, Cox suggests that he and Gruber
operated outside the larger international conspiracy to fix the
prices of citric acid around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   In his statements, Cox says that he acted as a ``conduit''
between the international conspiracy and Cargill, and that he
believed Gruber understood that. But he says that executives at the
other companies knew that he and Gruber were having these
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Favretto, the attorney for Cargill, said Cox's comments to
investigators were groundless. ``There is not a shred of evidence
supporting his statements,'' he said, adding that they unfairly
damage the reputation of Cargill and Gruber, who is now a vice
president in the company's corn milling division.
</P>
<P>
   Favretto also cited statements made by Scott Lassar, the U.S.
Attorney in Chicago who prosecuted and won convictions against
three Archer Daniels executives last year. In his closing
arguments, Lassar told a jury that ``Cargill was not involved in
price-fixing in citric acid.''

HOUSE REJECTS STRICT LIMIT ON SEXUAL OR VIOLENT MATERIAL FOR MINORS
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House rejected a proposal Wednesday that would
have placed strict prohibitions on the sale and dissemination of
explicitly sexual or violent material to minors as members began
consideration of juvenile crime and gun control bills in the wake
of the Colorado school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The 282-146 vote against restricting the sales of video games,
movies, music, books, art and other forms of entertainment followed
several hours of spirited debate over whether the measure sponsored
by Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., would violate
the Constitution's First Amendment guarantee of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, the House approved an amendment in
direct response to the Littleton, Colo., school shootings and
bombings that would crack down harder on major juvenile crime by
imposing tougher penalties and making it easier for minors to be
tried and incarcerated as adults. The measure, sponsored by Rep.
Bill McCollum, R-Fla., was approved 249-181, despite attempts by
some Democrats to kill it.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, said she was concerned that
the McCollum amendment ``ignores studies'' indicating that tougher
penalties don't necessarily result in reduced crime. She called on
her fellow lawmakers to do more in the area of prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The McCollum measure, she said, ``locks up our juveniles. It
throws away the key and it doesn't focus us on rehabilitation and
prevention programs.''
</P>
<P>
   The votes cleared the way for a debate today on several gun
control measures that were hammered out in response to the
Columbine High School tragedy in which 14 students and one teacher
were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders, over Democratic objections, succeeded in
separating most of the gun control issues opposed by the National
Rifle Association from the juvenile crime bill, hoping to avoid a
contentious debate that might end up killing legislation to
strengthen enforcement efforts targeted at the nation's youth.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate over the Hyde amendment and other crime measures
sparked a number of angry exchanges, including a few over GOP
efforts to focus the debate more on ``cultural problems''
associated with youth violence rather than the guns used to commit
much of that violence.
</P>
<P>
   Waving a gun and a television remote control at his colleagues,
Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., accused Republicans of trying to avoid
the hard decisions required to help limit youth access to guns by
muddying the waters with a debate over violence as depicted in the
entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of gun control, we're doing remote control,'' Wexler
bellowed. ``Instead of going after NRA, we're going after NBC.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Benjamin Cardin, D-Md., said he was concerned that
Republicans were intent on spending ``more time debating why a
child shouldn't see a handgun on TV instead of how to keep a child
from getting his hands on a handgun in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the attacks on Republican motives, Hyde insisted that
while common sense gun controls are important in the fight against
juvenile crime, Congress has an obligation to ``stand with''
parents and help them ``slow the flood of toxic waste into our
kids' minds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's critical that Congress address some of the
cultural issues ... that cause children to get a gun and commit a
violent act,'' he said, adding that passing more gun laws ``won't
get at the heart of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the problem is that many youngsters have been
overexposed to violence,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the Hyde amendment, which included a number of his
Republican colleagues on the judiciary panel, said it amounted to
an unconstitutional attack on First Amendment rights. If passed and
upheld by the courts, they said it could lead to censorship of
family movies and even nursery rhymes containing references to
violent acts.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Frost, D-Dallas, called it ``an unparalleled attack
on the first amendment,'' while Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., said it
would outlaw the rental and sale of Academy Award-winning movies
like ``Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A dealer who sells a `Shakespeare in Love' video would be
subject to criminal sanctions,'' she asserted, while a dealer who
peddles automatic weapons designed solely to kill people would not.
</P>
<P>
   The Hyde amendment would have placed severe restrictions on
youth access to art. For example, Democrat and Republican opponents
noted that it would prohibit minors in some instances from viewing
sculpture depicting female and male nude forms.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., said his colleague's proposal would
``create a police force'' to decide what is decent, violent or
pornographic.
</P>
<P>
   He wondered whether popular movies with depictions of violence
like ``Home Alone'' or ``Saving Private Ryan'' would be subject to
censor.
</P>
<P>
   Included in some of the other measures passed by the House on
Wednesday were penalties designed specifically to address firearms
taken to school by students.
</P>
<P>
   One amendment approved 296-133 would prohibit federal courts
from imposing early release programs because of prison crowding or
other conditions. The measure was sponsored by House Majority Whip
Tom DeLay, R-Texas, who told his colleagues that ``all the talk
about fighting crime and keeping children safe boils down to
nothing if we are not willing to keep prisoners behind bars where
they belong.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has already passed its own version of the juvenile
crime bill, including extending background checks to pawn shops and
gun shows. The House bill, which will be completed today, is
expected to be weaker on gun control but tougher on penalties for
juvenile offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Both bills will have to be merged into one in conference before
a final version can be sent on to the White House for the
president's signature.
</P>
<P>
   A number of amendments could prove too objectionable to
President Clinton and might prompt a veto, including DeLay's
amendment that would severely curtail the authority of federal
judges.

 AT&AMP;T APPEALS RULING FORCING IT TO SHARE CABLE LINES  &HT;     By DEBORAH SOLOMON 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
AT&AMP;T Corp. filed an appeal Wednesday of a ruling that would force
the telecommunications giant to share its cable lines with
competitors in Portland, Ore.
<P>
   As expected, AT&AMP;T is challenging a June 3 U.S. District Court
decision that allows other Internet service providers, such as
America Online, the right to offer high-speed Internet access over
AT&AMP;T's cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling could set a national precedent, as San Francisco and
other cities have been closely watching the Portland case and may
model their own policies on the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's appeal, filed in San Francisco, said the ruling violates
the Cable Act because municipalities don't have the right to
require ``open access.''
</P>
<P>
   When AT&AMP;T bought Tele-Communications Inc. last year, it had to
apply for a transfer of control of TCI's cable TV franchises in
each city where TCI operates. Officials in Portland said they would
approve the transfer but said AT&AMP;T had to lease its cable lines to
competitors who wanted to offer phone, video and high-speed
Internet access. AT&AMP;T and TCI sued Portland, saying cities had no
right to require this open access as a condition of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, a U.S. District judge sided with Portland, saying
cities could indeed impose open access.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, AT&AMP;T called the judge's decision wrong and said the
Cable Act specifically prevents municipalities from requiring
access to AT&AMP;T's high-speed pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Federal law could not be clearer,'' said Jim Cicconi, AT&AMP;T's
general counsel. ``By requiring that AT&AMP;T unbundle its cable
network, the Portland ordinance does exactly what federal law
forbids.''
</P>
<P>
   John Raposa, general counsel for GTE, which argued against AT&AMP;T
in the Portland case, said the ruling should be upheld because it
will give consumers more choices for high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, if Bay Area customers want to connect to the Internet
via cable TV lines, they have to go through Redwood City's Excite
AtHome. The service is available in about 40 Bay Area communities
for $40 a month, on top of the fee for cable TV service.
</P>
<P>
   If AT&AMP;T is forced to lease its lines to AOL, Compuserve and
other Internet service providers, consumers could soon get
high-speed Internet access from a number of players, potentially
reducing costs, Raposa said.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL SULLIVAN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
DALLAS _ The situation is familiar, but the timing is just a little
off.
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Dallas Stars last encountered a playoff Game 5, the sun
was high in the afternoon sky, and Ed Belfour regarded the
scheduling with all the enthusiasm of a vampire caught out after
hours. In the Western Conference finals against Colorado, the Stars
goalie watched the red light go on a whopping six times, by far his
worst effort of this postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Bad luck? Tough bounces? Poor defense?
</P>
<P>
   All of those played into that 7-5 loss, certainly, but Belfour
offers a more colorful explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an afternoon game,'' he recalled Wednesday. ``I don't
think either goalie was awake.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Belfour faces another Game 5, the next big step in these
Stanley Cup Finals against a Buffalo Sabres team that has been
reluctant to concede the issue. If the Stars could find any
consolation in all those missed chances in Tuesday night's 2-1 Game
4 loss in Buffalo, which tied the series at two games apiece, at
least they knew this much:
</P>
<P>
   Game 5 is a 7 p.m. start, getting Belfour back on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   This quirk was worth mentioning Wednesday as the teams returned
to Texas, since the Belfour-Dominik Hasek battle that gradually is
taking center stage in these Finals features players so different
in personality and image, yet so similar in results.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek is The Dominator, the Czech Olympic hero, the fellow
generally deemed the best in the world at what he does. His 30
saves in 31 shots Tuesday night makes a good argument on his
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the leader for us,'' Sabres coach Lindy Ruff said. ``He
just said, `Bring it on.'''
</P>
<P>
   Through four games, Hasek has faced 127 shots, compiling a 1.89
goals-against average against a Dallas team generally considered
deeper and more talented. Should the Sabres go on to win the
series, the perceived edge in goal will get plenty of mention in
explaining how the No. 7 seed in the East could find itself
hoisting the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   In getting his team this far, though, The Dominator has been no
stranger to showmanship, some of it seemingly gratuitous.
</P>
<P>
   Before Game 4, Hasek urged his team to take more chances
offensively and allow him to cover any defensive lapses. He backed
that up with a solid game that may not have been quite as
spectacular as the numbers would suggest, but some still wondered
what it all meant in terms of who was running the show.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Hasek's would-be heroics in Game 4, Belfour
shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time the goalie starts telling the forwards how to play
the game, it seems a little ridiculous,'' he said. ``It would be
like them telling me how to stop the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek wasn't quite done, though. For good measure, he also
turned in several Academy Award-caliber flops in the interest of
drawing penalties and fueling the fires of both teammates and fans.
</P>
<P>
   The message: You want a hero, Dom's your man.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour, by contrast, is a sad-eyed fellow who carries the
baggage of playoff failures past. As recently as the Colorado
series, when he got the better of three-time Stanley Cup winner
Patrick Roy, even teammates feared the 34-year-old ``Eagle'' was a
meltdown looking for a place to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek, who served as Belfour's backup when the two were in
Chicago earlier in the decade, doesn't mind encouraging talk that
the Stars keep Belfour in more of a comfort zone and that his old
teammate doesn't really measure up with the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our teams are different,'' Hasek says. ``The way they (the
Stars) play, their goalie does not see as many shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Belfour saw only 18, but that didn't make it an
easy night.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo's first goal came on a breakaway fueled by a Dallas
turnover. The second was the result of a giveaway when defenseman
Craig Ludwig virtually put the puck on Dixon Ward's stick in the
slot for what proved to be the winning goal.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, given such shoddy support, Belfour might have
gone ballistic. When Game 4 was in the books, he was the portrait
of calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``That happens once in a while,'' he said. ``You'd like to have
them both back, but they (the Sabres) made some nice shots, some
nice plays.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   With a little less than seven minutes remaining in the second
period, he stoned the Sabres' Joe Juneau at point-blank range,
keeping the Stars within a goal. A few minutes later, Belfour made
the most spectacular save of the evening, diving through the crease
to blunt Miroslav Satan's shot with a stick he extended over the
line at the last second.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a guy make plays like that, you'd like to be
able to score a couple of goals for him,'' Stars defenseman Richard
Matvichuk said. ``We haven't been able to do that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Stars are two games away from winning hockey's
greatest prize, in large part because Belfour's 1.89 GAA has
matched that of the more celebrated Hasek. True, Belfour has been
asked to face just 75 shots in those same four games, but that _ as
Hasek noted _ is largely a product of Dallas' stifling defense and
emphasis on shot-blocking.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: ``These games are 2-1 because of the guys in
goal,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Eddie Belfour has held up his end of the bargain. If he
can keep doing so over the next few games, the Stars will be happy
to wake him up in time for the parade.

COURT MATES: JACKSON ACCEPTS LAKERS' OFFER, CITING A MATCH OF
TALENTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By KEN GURNICK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ Phil Jackson, scheduled to appear in Los
Angeles on Thursday to help his former teammate Bill Bradley in his
quest for a $200,000-a-year job, showed up a day early and landed a
$6 million-a-year job for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who was wooed by the New York Knicks and the New Jersey
Nets, ended his one-year sabbatical Wednesday by formally accepting
a five-year, $30 million contract to become head coach of the Los
Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   The loss to Bradley's presidential campaign was a coup for a
Lakers team in need of a leader to harness the talents of Shaquille
O'Neal and Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew he was the right coach for this team; we all in
management knew he was the right coach for this team, and now the
players know it,'' said Magic Johnson, a Lakers vice president and
part owner who walked away from the coaching job after 16 games in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's enthusiasm reflected an urgency in the front office of
a franchise that won five National Basketball Association
championships in the 80s, but has not been to the finals since
1991. This season the Lakers were swept by San Antonio in the
second round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the start of another fantastic time for us,'' Jerry
West, the Lakers' executive vice president, said at a news
conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's salary is less than the $7 million a year the Nets are
believed to have offered him, and the $8 million a year Pat Riley
earns as coach and general manager of the Miami Heat. But it still
makes him one of the NBA's highest-paid coaches. The Lakers'
majority owner, Jerry Buss, had been reluctant to pay huge salaries
to coaches. But after the Lakers were swept in the second round of
the playoffs by the San Antonio Spurs, West quickly hammered out a
deal with Todd Musburger, Jackson's agent. Negotiations culminated
last week, while Jackson was fishing in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in an Eskimo village and a kid came out and said he
wanted my autograph because I coach his favorite team,'' Jackson
said. ``I told him I don't coach the Bulls anymore. He said his
favorite team is the Lakers and I was just hired. That's how I
heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who is 53, left the Chicago Bulls after coaching them
to their sixth championship in eight seasons and has the highest
regular-season and post-season winning percentages in NBA history.
He spent the last year ``re-energizing'' and campaigning for
Bradley, once his teammate with the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said his family helped persuade him to return to
coaching because ``it's what I do best,'' and that while he
considered other offers, it was the Lakers who piqued his interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought my talent and the talent of the team matched up,''
he said. ``It kind of meshed. Shaq, I feel for him. He's
underplayed his ability. He could be mvp I'm intrigued with Kobe.
He has Jordanesque-type ability, but he's uneducated in basketball
and in life. And it ends up with Jerry West, one of, if not the
best general managers to get talent. All these things fit
together.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM STARTS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Jackson criticized the East Coast news media for making an issue
of his secret meeting in April with Dave Checketts, the Madison
Square Garden president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Knicks were in ninth place at the time,'' he said. ``We
talked about searching for players and positions. It was blown
completely out of proportion. Obviously, Dave had people working
behind his back against him. There were no negotiations at that
time. I respect Dave and felt he had been maligned in that
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said that in talks with the Nets in late May or early
June, he told Raymond Chambers, one of the team's owners, that the
organization was moving in the right direction but that he did not
feel up to coaching this year. Chambers asked if there was any team
that could make Jackson change his mind. ``I said the Lakers,''
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he needed to talk to the current coaching staff
before naming his assistants. That includes his predecessor, Kurt
Rambis, who has been promised a job in the organization after
taking over from Del Harris 12 games into the season.  &QL;

GREAT LITERATURE. PERIOD COSTUMES. THAT IS SO COOL.  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Oliver Parker's slick new screen adaptation of ``An Ideal
Husband,'' one of Oscar Wilde's lesser-known stage comedies, all of
the well-heeled characters, played by such of-the-moment film
actors as Rupert Everett, Cate Blanchett and Minnie Driver, gather
for an evening in the theater.
</P>
<P>
   The camera shifts fleetly from box seat to box seat, recording
the stars' suggestive smiles and meaningful glances and helping to
frame one of the movie's motifs, that in the social whirl of London
100 years ago, the privileged classes were as prone to the vanities
and weaknesses of the heart, soul and purse as the beautiful people
of today.
</P>
<P>
   As we watch them watch, the sights and sounds of an actual play
can be discerned, and any theatergoer with even a passing
acquaintance with Wilde will get the director's joke. It is Wilde's
masterpiece ``The Importance of Being Earnest'' that unfolds in the
background. Yet more than an homage is intended, it seems.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the rest of Parker's chiseled, glamourpuss production,
the sequence from ``Earnest'' is starchy and antique-looking, a
pill prescribed by a Victorian physician. In the contrast one can
infer the director's subliminal message. That may have been your
great-grandfather's ``Earnest.'' But this is (italics)your(end
italics) ``Ideal Husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker's movie, which opened Friday, is the latest entry in a
burgeoning genre, the hip theatrical period piece. ``Shakespeare in
Love'' is the apogee in this prestige category, having polished the
concept to a high gloss and hit the jackpot with a film that was
not only robustly witty and romantic but also helpfully filled with
young stars like Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Affleck.
</P>
<P>
   ``An Ideal Husband'' aspires to the same kind of crossover
appeal to literary and popular tastes. (Less successful was the
recent ``Midsummer Night's Dream,'' with Michelle Pfeiffer and
Calista Flockhart.)
</P>
<P>
   ``An Ideal Husband'' is polished, too, and filled with
first-rate British acting talent in small roles down to
infinitesimal ones. (Great actors of the London stage are often
wasted in movie walk-ons; here the travesties include peekaboo
appearances by Simon Russell Beale, recently seen as Iago in Sam
Mendes's ``Othello,'' and Nickolas Grace, so wonderful years ago in
``Brideshead Revisited.'')
</P>
<P>
   And in the participation of Everett, Ms. Blanchett, Ms. Driver
and the cast's single American lead in Julianne Moore, the film
more than meets the demand for players who can garner the attention
of editors at People and Vanity Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even with its formidable quotients of finery and
celebrity, ``An Ideal Husband'' is less than an ideal transfer from
the stage to the screen. It's a sleek film, yes, but it also seems
supermodel-scrawny, thin and alabaster pale to the point of
translucence. Of course it comes with the trademark Wildean
epigrams: ``To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong
romance''; ``what is unfashionable is what other people wear'' _
all those juicy bon mots uttered on divans, bridle paths and
greenswards over Darjeeling, port and Havanas.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all of its glibness, the movie is neither particularly
redolent of Wildean hilarity nor infused with the playwright's
celebrated iconoclasm. It's a rather numbing little melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, ``An Ideal Husband'' is not Wilde in tiptop form. The
play has had its admirers _ George Bernard Shaw famously declared
it superior to ``Earnest'' _ and rare, acclaimed revivals like
Peter Hall's 1996 Broadway production. Nevertheless, Wilde's
achievement here is a lesser one, on a par with his conventionally
well-made ``Lady Windermere's Fan'' rather than the eternally
piquant and winning ``Earnest.''
</P>
<P>
   On Broadway, Hall enriched the proceedings by accentuating the
play's obsession with money and the sexual ambiguity of a central
character, Lord Goring, played intriguingly onstage by Martin Shaw
and less so in the film by Everett.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hall made it clear that while the confirmed bachelor Goring
might have been ``the idlest man in London,'' he was the most
entertaining personage in the story. It concerns the blackmailing
of Goring's best friend, Sir Robert Chiltern (played in the movie
by Jeremy Northam), by the mysterious Mrs. Cheveley (Ms. Moore).
Chiltern is a revered Member of Parliament and outstanding husband,
one of the ideal ones of the title, who hides a secret about
ill-gotten gains. Mrs. Cheveley threatens to expose him, blackening
his name and likely ruining his marriage to the worshipful Gertrude
(Ms. Blanchett).
</P>
<P>
   Around this pivotal crisis orbit the tale's other ethical and
farcical elements, including the question of whether Goring will
ever wed the adoring Mabel (Ms. Driver, in a role pumped up for the
movie version).
</P>
<P>
   Wilde once declared to a friend that ``An Ideal Husband''
``contained a great deal of the real Oscar.'' In the Broadway
revival, Hall clearly took Wilde at his word, turning Goring into a
stand-in for Wilde himself, an invention that enveloped Goring's
flirtations with Mabel in an ironic and gently touching air.
Parker, who also wrote the screenplay, takes a more widely
commercial (and less interesting) tack, conceiving Goring as a
fin-de-siecle matinee idol.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Ideal Husband'' pins its hopes, in fact, on the bankable
charms Everett exhibited in ``My Best Friend's Wedding.'' If the
success of ``Shakespeare in Love'' was embodied most completely in
the star-making performance by Ms. Paltrow, who was rewarded with
an Oscar, the filmmakers here appear to be counting on similar
feats of cinematic strength by Everett, whom the camera stalks
throughout this picture like an obsessed fan.
</P>
<P>
   Near the beginning of the film, there's a shameless
acknowledgment of the actor's physical appeal. Parallel scenes of
the upper-class men and women in leisurely pursuits have Ms.
Blanchett and Ms. Driver trapped in the contortions of a living
tableau, while Northam and Everett lounge in some sort of sauna.
Northam is bundled up. Everett, however, reclines in the pose of a
Greek hero, bare-chested and beaded with perspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Wilde's risible characters tend to be in on the elaborate joke
or completely out of it. Everett occupies some territory in
between; he's terribly self-conscious in this movie, his every roll
of the eye and peeved grimace and pouting glance slavishly
documented by the cinematographer. The effect on an audience is
predictable: at a recent preview, appreciative laughter rose from
his fans at the slightest on-screen wince or flinch.
</P>
<P>
   But his is not the only overdone portrayal: Ms. Moore, a
delightful chameleon of an actress on most occasions, is weirdly
woozy here as Mrs. Cheveley, speaking oddly through clenched teeth
and appearing at times to be a victim of overmedication.
</P>
<P>
   Parker takes some liberties with the text, creating, for
example, a character for the actor Jeroen Krabbe in a flashback
sequence that provides more heft and emphasis for Chiltern's
misdeed. But it is not the mechanics of adaptation that constrain
this ``Husband.'' It's the attempt to dress Wilde to the teeth, to
package his words, rather than live in them again.

 LATEST PALMTOPS ARE PUMPED UP  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Combine the proven popularity of 3Com's Palm handheld organizers
with the allure of the Internet, make it work without wires, and
you have something that ought to be unbeatable.
<P>
   It's called the Palm VII, and it truly is nifty _ a tantalizing
taste of a future in which wireless communicators are as
commonplace as calculators, or maybe even wristwatches. But put it
to work in the here and now, as I have been doing for the past
couple of weeks, and you quickly bump up against some frustrating
limitations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, I have also been trying out the Cassiopeia E100, a
pocket-size competitor from Casio. It does not have wireless or
even a conventional modem built in, and its software, Microsoft's
Windows CE, is not as elegant as Palm's. But the E100 has some
unique virtues of its own _ notably, a gorgeous color screen and a
headphone jack that lets you listen to digital music in stereo.
</P>
<P>
   Neither device is easy to get hold of, and in both cases prices
are steep. The Palm VII costs $599, plus monthly service fees, and
it is currently on sale only in the New York area, although the
wireless features work anywhere in urban America. (It is slated to
go on sale nationwide this fall.). The Cassiopeia E100 lists for
$499, and although in theory it is available anywhere, in reality
dealers report long waiting lists for it.
</P>
<P>
   PALM BASICS: The Palm VII looks like older Palm organizers,
rather than the sleek and silvery new Palm V. In most ways, it also
works &LR;   &LR; like previous models. It has the same easy-to-use software
for recording names and addresses, appointments, to-do items,
expenses and notes. You enter your information the same way, by
writing on it with a stylus in a simplified alphabet called
Graffiti. And, as before, you can connect the device to a PC or a
Mac and synchronize handheld and desktop data at the press of one
button.
</P>
<P>
   The new model also shares the shortcomings of its older
siblings. The monochrome screen is sharp but small _ about 21/4
inches square _ and dim. Switching on backlighting turns it a
garish green. A pair of AAA batteries can still run it for weeks,
depending on usage; unfortunately, unlike the new Palm V, it does
not have a rechargeable power pack built in.
</P>
<P>
   NET ACCESS, PALM-STYLE: Aside from a slightly elongated shape,
the only visual clue to the Palm VII's uniqueness is a small
plastic antenna along the right side. Swing it up, and within
seconds you are automatically connected to 3Com's Palm.net service.
Work your way through a few simple screens to set up your account
and you are ready to start exchanging e-mail or gathering
information from the Web wirelessly.
</P>
<P>
   Within limits. You have to use a new e-mail address at Palm.net,
rather than your existing address. Long messages are cut off or
simply not delivered, and attached files, except plain-text memos,
are removed.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, it is somewhere in between a full-blown e-mail
system and a text pager. Unlike a pager, though, the Palm VII does
not automatically receive new messages sent your way _ you do not
get them until you fire up Palm's iMessenger program to check for
them.
</P>
<P>
   As for the World Wide Web, you can't browse it in the
traditional sense from the Palm VII _ the screen is too small and
the wireless network Palm uses too slow (a paltry 8 kilobytes per
second) for that. What you can do is choose among a set of small
Palm programs that let you retrieve specific bits of information,
which Palm calls ``Web clippings,'' from selected sites.
</P>
<P>
   You can, for instance, get news briefs from ABC News and USA
Today, headlines and summaries from the Wall Street Journal (and
full stories if you open an extra-cost subscription) and sports
scores from ESPN. You can get stock quotes (but not trade) via
E-Trade, check your Bank of America balance and get the address of
the nearest ATM. Or look up phone numbers, e-mail addresses,
airline schedules, movie show times, hotel and restaurant listings,
traffic and weather reports, even miniature maps. Answers generally
come back within 5 to 15 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Such tidbits are a far cry from the breadth and depth of the Web
itself, but they will be of great value to many users, especially
busy business travelers. And being able to get them within seconds,
wherever you are, without even having to plug into a phone line, is
a huge convenience.
</P>
<P>
   You will pay for the convenience, though. Besides a one-time $20
set-up fee, basic service is $9.99 a month. But that covers only 50
Kbytes of transferred data _ something like 30 messages (one a
day), 20 stock quotes, 10 sports scores, 10 traffic reports, and 10
weather updates. For $24.99 a month you can receive three times as
much data. But serious Internet junkies will eat through that in
days, and with either monthly plan, Palm charges 30 cents for each
extra kilobyte.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, the Palm VII is both elegant and innovative. But as
an Internet access device, it is also pricey and limited. If you
want full untethered access to the Net, you will be better off, at
least in the Bay Area, with one of Metricom's Ricochet wireless
modems.
</P>
<P>
   BOLD AND BRIGHT: The Palm VII's other big weakness is its
screen, which my over-50 eyes found difficult to read under many
lighting conditions. The opposite is true of the Cassiopeia E100:
Its screen is its most outstanding feature. It is noticeably bigger
than the Palm VII's, but the real difference is that Casio's
display has bright, crisp 16-bit color. Color is not just more
pleasant to look at than the drab Palm screen _ it also makes text
much easier to read and screen controls easier to manage.
</P>
<P>
   The silver Casio unit itself is a little thicker and heavier
than the Palm VII, but it still fits easily in a shirt pocket. Its
lithium-ion battery pack lasts around six hours. That could be a
problem if, for example, you plan to use it while hiking,
especially because you can't just swap in a new set of disposable
batteries. But if you keep it in its cradle when at your desk, and
plug its AC adapter into the cradle, it will recharge as you work
and be ready to roll when you are.
</P>
<P>
   The device's software, the palm-size edition of Windows CE,
provides personal-information management features like Palm's,
except that, oddly, there is no expense-recording program. As with
Palm devices, you enter data with a stylus, but with the Casio you
get more choices about how: You can tap out your words on an
on-screen keyboard or use a program called Jot, which does an
excellent job recognizing either conventional block printing or
Graffiti-style script.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Windows CE often complain that its desktop-derived
user interface is too complex and clunky for palm-size devices.
There is truth to that, but Casio has gone a long way toward
addressing the issue by adding a new iconic program-launching
screen, plus several user-configurable buttons.
</P>
<P>
   Windows CE's desktop-connectivity software could be simpler to
set up, but it works well with Windows PCs. (There is no Mac
version at all.) I configured the software to synchronize
automatically with Outlook 98 on my PCs at home and at work, so
every time I enter an appointment or contact name on the handheld
or either desktop machine, it is automatically copied to the others
the next time I plug the E100 into the PC. I don't even have to
remember to push a button!
</P>
<P>
   MULTIMEDIA IN YOUR HAND: Where the E100 really leads the pack is
in its audio and even video capabilities, though you will have to
install some extra software to take full advantage of them. At
www.audible.com, for example, you can find a free player for audio
books and articles. And at &LR;   &LR; www.xaudio.com, you can download the
killer app for this device: a free player for MP3 music, the
digital-audio format that has taken the Internet by storm.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Cassiopeia comes with 16 megabytes of RAM (compared to
only 2 MB in the Palm VII), you will probably have room for only
two or three cuts. But since the E100 has a special slot for a kind
of add-on memory called CompactFlash, you can easily pop in extra
RAM. I added a 48MB CompactFlash card, which should easily hold
between 10 to 20 songs.
</P>
<P>
   What you end up with is a full-blown pocket-size MP3 player,
comparable to Diamond Multimedia's popular Rio, except that the
E100 is also a versatile organizer. A small built-in speaker puts
out surprisingly good-quality sound, though not much volume. But
most people will use the headphone jack, which generates output
that to my ear is nearly indistinguishable from CD-quality.
</P>
<P>
   BOTTOM LINE: Which, if either, of these devices makes sense for
you obviously depends on your needs, tastes and budget. Personally,
I was more excited to discover the Cassiopeia E100, which has not
yet received much publicity, and more frustrated by the limitations
of the Palm VII, about which there has been so much hype. But both
devices, in my opinion, are indisputably cool.

OPHULS' MOVIES DISPLAY DEPTH THAT MADE HIM A FILMMAKER'S ROLE MODEL
  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 20) 
</HEADLINE>
 (rk) 
 By PHILLIP LOPATE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Whatever the summer movies may bring, it is a safe
bet that the most ravishing, romantic images on-screen this season
will be at the Max Ophuls retrospective, starting on June 26 and
running through July 15 at the Film Society of Lincoln Center's
Walter Reade Theater.
</P>
<P>
   This virtually complete selection of 21 Ophuls films, with many
rarities and new prints, will be catnip for film buffs, who regard
the divine Max as their patron saint _ perhaps because no other
director in the history of movies wrung so much emotional resonance
from cinematic technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``His camera could pass through walls,'' said Stanley Kubrick,
referring to Ophuls' penchant for movement. The French New Wave,
especially Francois Truffaut, regarded him as their auteur role
model, because he had managed to impose a personal style in the
face of producer pressures. A bon vivant who was subject to fits of
depression, Ophuls dramatized the will to pleasure and its
attendant humiliations.
</P>
<P>
   But Ophuls also had his detractors, who saw him as a decorative
stylist without substance. The fact that he made what might be
called ``women's films'' held him back from being taken seriously
during his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   It was only after his death, in 1957, that he was canonized,
though there is still debate whether to regard him as a ``beloved
minor master'' (Richard Roud) or ``one of the greatest of film
directors'' (David Thomson). The paradox of Max Ophuls is that he
may have been both _ minor and great.
</P>
<P>
   One is tempted to call Ophuls a Viennese master, since so many
of his signature works are set in 1900 Vienna. Yet the facts are
that he was a German who gravitated to France.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn imaginatively to the end of the century Vienna of
Schnitzler, Freud and Hapsburg pomp, Ophuls re-created it on the
sound stage as a closed society with recognizable types (army
officer, artist, investor, beautiful young woman desired by all),
locales (Opera, Prater park, train station) and moral quandaries
(family pressure to marry, adultery, aristocratic code of honor,
the duel.)
</P>
<P>
   Ophuls himself came from a more bourgeois, nondueling
background. He was born Max Oppenheimer in 1902; his German-Jewish
family owned a department store, and in deference to their
proprieties he changed his name when he decided to pursue acting.
</P>
<P>
   Short, not particularly handsome, with no acting talent, he
quickly switched to directing. By age 23 he had directed hundreds
of plays, operettas and radio shows, and worked at the Burg theater
in Vienna (the one year he lived in that city). There he also met
and married actress Hilde Wall. By 1930, recognized as a premiere
theater director, he was lured into filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   The tragic love story ``Liebelei'' (1933), adapted from
Schnitzler, gave Ophuls his first international success. In
``Liebelei'' a young opera singer and an officer of the dragoons
fall in love, but past mistakes catch up with the officer: he is
forced to fight a fatal duel with an ex-mistress' husband. This
simple, delicate film is embellished with tender scenes of lovers
riding through the snow, waltzing all night in a Viennese cafe.
Courtship passages were an Ophuls specialty.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s Ophuls left Nazi Germany to make movies in Italy,
Holland and France. ``La Signora di Tutti'' (Everybody's Woman),
shot in Italy in 1934, was a particularly sparkling, if mordant,
tale of a reluctant femme fatale: a young woman whose beauty brings
death and misery to everyone around her. She ends up a movie star.
</P>
<P>
   The shot of her rowing in a boat while her elderly married
suitor drives along the riverbank in pursuit has a gliding
liquidity, both pastoral and ominous. ``La Signora di Tutti'' also
initiated the Ophuls tendency to tell a character's life story,
``Citizen Kane''-like, through a complex flashback structure.
</P>
<P>
   Of the eight features he shot in France during this period, all
have their charms, but the freshest is ``Divine'' (1935), from a
Colette script about music-hall life. Ophuls loved to film the
backstage milieu, the agitations of show people. The result was
what Truffaut called ``a little masterpiece of verve, health and
life with that Ophulsian fury that drives the camera up staircases,
into the flies, in and out of the wings.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1941, just managing to escape the Gestapo, he landed in
Hollywood, along with many other European refugees, and cooled his
heels for four years, waiting for someone to offer him work. He
finally directed four pictures for small studios, including an
under-rated 1949 gem, ``The Reckless Moment,'' with Joan Bennett
and James Mason.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Koch, who wrote the screenplay for Ophuls' best American
movie, ``Letter From an Unknown Woman,'' recalled: ``I remember my
first impression of him as a baldish Peter Lorre, with the same
heavy-lidded, wide-set eyes and the same impish sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Ophuls had transported to California his wife, Hilde, his son,
Marcel (later to become an important documentary filmmaker) _ and
his attractive young mistress. ``Since Americans are not adept at
this sort of thing,'' wrote Koch, ``Max undertook to instruct me on
some of the finer points. One of his rules that I recall is that
cut flowers are properly sent to one's mistress as they are
perishable, whereas a plant, being more durable and therefore more
economical, is the correct choice for one's wife.''
</P>
<P>
   It is this wry, unshocked recognition of the desires and
complications of adult life that Ophuls brought to the American
screen. In ``Letter From an Unknown Woman,'' for instance, a young
Viennese woman, Lisa (warmly played by Joan Fontaine), has a
gigantic crush on a dashing composer-pianist, Stefan (Louis
Jourdan). She tracks him down, sleeps with him and, when he
disappears, bears his child without telling him.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years later, married, she bumps into him, goes to his rooms
again, ready to throw over all her security for love _ only to
discover he has no memory of her. Yet, for all her disillusionment,
she is throughout, as critic Molly Haskell has observed, the active
party, one of those Ophuls heroines who become ``militarists of
love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Letter From an Unknown Woman'' offers a feast of
black-and-white chiaroscuro: pools of shadows and gaslight
distributed impeccably in the frame, thanks to Franz Planer's
brilliant photography, but also to Ophuls' theater background,
which encouraged Expressionist lighting and a stylized suggestion
of background detail. Meanwhile, his gliding camera roved up
staircases and paced through rooms, bringing a joyous pulse to this
otherwise plangent material.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Why did Ophuls move his camera so? Much learned nonsense has
been written about the symbol of the Ophulsian circle, about time,
transcendence, the lustful gaze of the moviegoer trapped and
imprisoned within the frame. Perhaps James Mason (who starred in
two Ophuls movies and revered him) came closest with the rhymed
suggestion that he did it for fun:
</P>
<P>
   A shot that does not call for tracks
</P>
<P>
   Is agony for poor dear Max
</P>
<P>
   Who separated from his dolly
</P>
<P>
   Is wrapped in deepest
</P>
<P>
   melancholy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ophuls seemed to take boyish pleasure in solving the technical
questions of the long take. His curiosity kept him glued to his
protagonists, while showing the whirl of indifferent life around
them. Others have suggested that he moved his camera to help his
actors, who were forced into naturalness by motion. His mobile
camera imposed a sense of fatalism on the story, oddly enough, as
though all this lilting motion were only there to hasten a final
stasis.
</P>
<P>
   When Ophuls returned to France in 1950, he embarked on a quartet
of historical films considered by critics to be his most
significant works: ``La Ronde,'' ``Le Plaisir,'' ``The Earrings of
Madame De ... ,'' and ``Lola Montes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``La Ronde'' took Ophuls back to Schnitzler's 1900 Vienna: he
solved the challenge of the play's maddening kaleidoscopic shifts
by inventing a new character, the master of ceremonies, played by
Anton Walbrook, who keeps reappearing under different disguises,
commenting on the ``art of love'' and binding the film together
while pointing out its artifice. (At one point he is glimpsed
mischievously snipping out a sex scene.)
</P>
<P>
   Ophuls had a brilliant cast to work with, including Simone
Signoret, Gerard Philipe, Danielle Darrieux, Serge Reggiani and
Jean-Louis Barrault. The film was an enormous popular success. He
followed this up with ``Le Plaisir'' (``Pleasure''), a ripe,
virtuoso compilation film drawn from three de Maupassant stories.
Again there was an invented narrator-character, adding another
worldly layer of commentary.
</P>
<P>
   Ophuls had reached a new stage in handling romantic genre
material. From the straight renditions of ``Liebelei,'' he had
moved to complicate, take apart, use flashbacks within flashbacks,
multiply narratives into vignettes and intrude an ironic narrator.
He also took to fragmenting images by shooting characters through
windows, behind glass partitions and in front of mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   Ophuls became, in short, more of a self-consciously modernist
artist.
</P>
<P>
   This self-reflective process reached its apotheosis in his
disturbing last film, ``Lola Montes'' (1956), the only one he made
in color and Cinemascope. Here the backgrounds are sumptuously
animated, while the central performance, Lola (Martine Carol),
remains wooden. True, the barely adequate, sex-kittenish Carol was
not his choice, but having accepted her, Ophuls did little to bring
her performance alive, gambling that its very blankness would drive
home the point of the film, that desire was a matter of projection.
</P>
<P>
   He confessed he was not much interested in this courtesan. ``But
the people around her, they are passionately interesting,'' he
said. ``If the public understands that these characters are not
secondary or `episodic,' as people like to say, then all is well.''
The public didn't; they heckled so much that police had to be
called in. Truffaut, Rossellini, Cocteau, Tati and other respected
filmmakers signed a petition endorsing the film.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics consider ``Lola Montes'' Ophuls' supreme
masterpiece. I regard this as wishful thinking by auteurists, who
want to see his last work as the summit of his art, not as a
fascinating, flawed, transitional film he had the bad luck not to
outlive.
</P>
<P>
   True, ``Lola Montes'' makes the best case for Ophuls as a
pioneering post-modernist. But before we enshrine him as a clever
deconstructionist of spectacle or a Brechtian practicing alienation
effects, we ought to remember what draws us to his art in the first
place: his capacity to convey feelings rapturously onscreen.
</P>
<P>
   In each Ophuls film, there is a moment when a man and a woman
first become aware of their magnetic attraction and lean into each
other. It is always a believable scene; Ophuls had the knack of
capturing sexual emanations on film. He was not necessarily a big
believer in love: sometimes the infatuations signify no more than
physical attraction, or painful misunderstandings with eternal love
on one side and momentary appetite on the other (``Letter From an
Unknown Woman'').
</P>
<P>
   Ophuls was always a realist when it came to the transience of
erotic feelings. ``La Ronde'' and ``Le Plaisir'' are sardonic
paeans to the mechanical underpinnings of amorous transport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Earrings of Madame De ...'' represents an exquisite
balance in Ophuls' late manner between engagement and detachment,
cynicism and idealism. It is graced by three immortal performances.
A witty, hardened general and his vain, frivolous wife (played by
Charles Boyer and Danielle Darrieux) are used to deceiving each
other. He has mistresses, and will accept any number of his wife's
suitors, so long as her heart is untouched by love.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, she meets an elegant Italian diplomat (Vittorio
de Sica), who sweeps her off her feet. The great ballroom montage,
which conflates weeks of courtship into a single protracted waltz,
leads to her confession of love: ``I don't love you,'' she says,
meaning she does. Used to lying as a matter of course, she finds
herself confounded by the rules of genuine feeling. Ophuls gave
Darrieux the instruction to use her charms to ``incarnate a void.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Chekov's lady with a lap dog, Madame De, initially shallow,
becomes deepened and purified, if destroyed, by the experience of
love. What makes the film so extraordinary is the coexistence of
the libertinish pleasure given to the eye, and the cruelly moral,
inexorable narrative tightening like a noose.
</P>
<P>
   One may go back and forth in one's feelings about other Ophuls
movies, falling under their spell one time, coming back years later
and finding them contrived or melodramatic. But ``The Earrings of
Madame De ... '' is always sublime. It is a perfect film. Anyone
who made one of the greatest films of all time cannot, in the end,
be considered minor.

 SAME PALM SIZE AT A SMALLER PRICE  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The success of 3Com's Palm electronic organizers is generating
increasing competition, not just from Casio and other manufacturers
using Windows CE, but also from new players promoting lower-cost
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   The latest to enter the race is a Palo Alto startup called Fuga
Corp., which this spring introduced a palm-size device called the
eDiary. At first glance, it looks similar to the Palm III and older
3Com models. Like them, it stores contact information, calendar
entries, tasks, expenses and similar data, and it syncs with a PC
via a serial cable.
</P>
<P>
   Fuga touts two big advantages to the eDiary. One is price: It is
only $149.99, direct from Fuga's Web site (www.fuga.com). The other
is simplicity. The company says it is aiming not at the tech-savvy
computer elite that have flocked to Palm, but at ordinary
small-business people who until now have relied mainly on paper
organizers and sticky notes.
</P>
<P>
   To appeal to such users, Fuga's design minimizes reliance on
menu commands, multiple windows and dialog boxes. Most kinds of
data are displayed on a single central page, which Fuga calls
VuOne, with letters identifying the type of data (E for expense, T
for To Do and other letters for any custom categories you create).
To get more details, such as a phone number for someone with whom
you have scheduled a meeting, you simply drag the stylus over the
item name, and a small pane with additional info pops up.
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, the eDiary has no handwriting recognition _ you
have to enter data by tapping on a tiny on-screen keyboard. The
screen is even darker and dimmer than the Palm's. And Fuga's PC
software does not sync automatically or on command with Outlook or
any other desktop personal-information management programs. If you
use any such software on the PC, you have to export your data
manually, then import it into the Fuga program; changes on either
device are not automatically communicated to the other.
</P>
<P>
   Fuga's eDiary is not the only low-cost option in the growing
personal data assistant market. Royal, a division of Italy's
Olivetti, now sells a device it calls the Da Vinci for $99. And
this summer it is scheduled to roll out an improved version called
the Da Vinci Pro. Casio, in addition to its more expensive Windows
CE products, offers two new items, the PV-100 and PV-200, that are
designed simply to function as mobile ``Pocket Viewers'' for data
from Microsoft Outlook; they list for $149 and $179, respectively.
Older Palm and Windows CE devices are also frequently available for
less than $200, as are units in Sharp's venerable Wizard line. And
Casio, Sharp, Franklin and other vendors make simple electronic
address books at prices that go well below $50.

CONDUCTING A CHEMICAL EXPERIMENT 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 20) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ohio, Calif.)   (af)

<P>
   Franz Welser-Most's scheduled ascendance in 2002 to music
director of the Cleveland Orchestra is hopeful news. Conductors and
orchestras are sometimes about individual and collective
personalities, but in some places, Cleveland among them, the
subject is chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Christoph von Dohnanyi was the missing ingredient when he took
over a brilliant band of Cleveland players in 1984. Extraordinary
ensemble virtuosity met deep and implacable seriousness, setting
off some of the most significant orchestra playing of the
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Dohnanyi may not be the best conductor in the world, nor
Cleveland the best orchestra, but together they are hard to beat.
</P>
<P>
   With its ensemble skills still palpably in place from the George
Szell era, Cleveland could just as easily have slipped into the
narcissism that beset our own New York Philharmonic under Zubin
Mehta. This was bad chemistry, in which the worst instincts of both
parties served as mutual catalysts. If Kurt Masur's tenure, itself
about to end, has been a little dour, it has scrubbed away
accumulated slickness.
</P>
<P>
   Welser-Most's recent guest appearance in New York produced a
Bruckner Fifth Symphony filled with structural disconnections and a
brass section turned loose to bully everything around it. Tough and
talented professionals don't like conductors who talk a lot, and
this was one of the complaints coming out of his rehearsals here.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Sanderling has not had a happy time in New York either,
although the Los Angeles Philharmonic likes him a lot. Colin Davis,
however, has players here in the palm of his hand and has got
wonderfully musical performances from them. Strange indeed are the
chemical reactions of the orchestra business.
</P>
<P>
   Welser-Most, a serious and talented musician, took a public
beating at the London Philharmonic a few years back, as London's
many (perhaps too many) orchestras competed viciously not just for
a finite audience but also for shrinking government financing.
</P>
<P>
   He is older, at 38, and Cleveland will be a quieter place.
Indeed, his new ensemble may profit from being in a less glamorous
city. The Cleveland Orchestra tours and records to great acclaim,
but it can always return to the relative peace of Severence Hall
and a loyal, sophisticated audience.
</P>
<P>
   The Welser-Most appointment removes one name from many other
short lists. Esa-Pekka Salonen was said to be coveted in Cleveland,
but he will remain in Los Angeles, if, that is, composing
aspirations do not siphon his energies. Salonen has been brave,
forward-looking and a salesman as well.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Boulez's visits to Cleveland have heavily supplemented
Dohnanyi's efforts to make the orchestra a force in 20th-century
performance, but basically this is an ensemble grounded in an older
tradition. Maybe that fact gave Salonen pause. He is getting his
way in Los Angeles. He also might not trade the seductions of
Southern California for those of industrial Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Like New York and Cleveland, the Philadelphia Orchestra has
asked its departing music director to stay around until a
replacement is in place. But as Wolfgang Sawallisch gradually makes
his way to the door, no one new has appeared. Philadelphia
management salivates over the prospect of Simon Rattle, who has
conducted there with great success and is now cut loose from his
orchestra in Birmingham, England.
</P>
<P>
   Rattle could certainly muster the earthmoving equipment
necessary to a bring a relatively staid city and a conservative
orchestra board up to his standards of adventure, but it would
require a tremendous effort.
</P>
<P>
   Riccardo Chailly, now in Amsterdam, might try. He knows the
orchestra; he has good contacts with the recording business, and he
could well rouse Philadelphia to old standards. Chailly's
glamour-minded conducting and the Concertgebouw Orchestra's
strait-laced tradition have created odd bedfellows, but there has
been a rise from financial decline.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that could happen in Philadelphia, a city that has clung
to an old concert space of atrocious acoustics and been dragged
toward a replacement hall kicking and screaming.
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on Rattle in New York either, even though he could
handle the city's pressure and its show-me toughness as well as
anybody. He has never conducted the Philharmonic, though if my
sources are right, it is not for lack of being asked.
</P>
<P>
   Rattle reportedly wants Europe as his base and has his eye on
yet another opening, at the Berlin Philharmonic. As Claudio Abbado
gradually withdraws from that job, aspirants have been narrowed to
two: Rattle and Daniel Barenboim. Barenboim, music director in
Chicago and a big player in European music, appears to be the
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Rattle, linked for years to the Boston Symphony's future, is
probably tired of waiting. For better or worse, Seiji Ozawa seems
an immovable incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   The name now circling the New York job is Riccardo Muti. I don't
think the yearslong chemistry of Muti's tenure in Philadelphia was
a good one, but his straightforward musicianship and great skills
might work here. Muti, it is also said, is not indifferent to
history and might find attractive a job once held by another
Italian, Arturo Toscanini.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest conducting talent floating around America
is an American, James Levine of the Metropolitan Opera. Levine has
his European orchestra now, a Munich Philharmonic badly in need of
rehabilitation. He has also shown in a brilliant and expanding
series of concerts how well he and his opera orchestra can play the
symphonic repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Levine would compromise that relationship for the New
York Philharmonic job is an interesting question. It could
certainly save on cab fare. His two offices at Lincoln Center would
be about 100 yards apart.
</P>

RESTORING YESTERDAY'S STARS TO THE LIMELIGHT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWABSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The rich and various history of art in New York in
the 1960s and 70s is being rewritten _ not at any of the
universities where graduate students avidly pore over the origins
of Pop, Minimal and Conceptual Art, nor at the uptown museums that
seem content to keep reinvestigating acknowledged masters like
Jasper Johns and Ellsworth Kelly, but at a hole-in-the-wall
storefront gallery on Thompson Street. The gallery can't even open
before 3 p.m. because its owner, a high school science teacher
named Mitchell Algus, arrives after his first workday ends.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what a growing number of artists and critics
have been saying over the last few years. All of them seem to have
heard of the gallery by word of mouth, or just by having happened
to walk by when something interesting in the window caught their
eye. It's not unusual, of course, for galleries that show work by
young and relatively untested artists to be run on this kind of
shoestring basis. But the Mitchell Algus Gallery has a different
kind of program. Though Algus sometimes shows emerging artists too,
many of those he exhibits have had long and significant careers.
Some have had retrospectives at major museums; their work has been
featured on the covers of prominent art magazines or reproduced in
standard references like Irving Sandler's ``New York School'' or
Lucy Lippard's ``Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art
Object.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all that, their names now trigger little more than a
vague recognition on the part of even the most passionate art
lovers. The museums keep their works in the basement, not on the
wall. They are artists who, for one reason or another, have dropped
out of the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   A good example would be Larry Zox, an abstract painter who was
honored by a full-scale retrospective at the Whitney Museum in 1973
but whose show at the Algus Gallery last winter was his first in
New York since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Another is Nicholas Krushenick, whose last works (he died of
cancer in February) are currently on view at the gallery, along
with a pair of his first mature paintings, dated 1962. The artist
Peter Halley, writing in the May issue of Artforum, called him
``one of the most exciting painters to emerge in the early 60s,''
thanks to his ``uncanny ability to transform dynamic forces into a
disembodied language of cartoonlike forms.''
</P>
<P>
   Algus is making ``an incredibly important contribution,'' says
Raphael Rubinstein, an art critic who is a senior editor at Art in
America. ``Other people talk about revisionist art history, but he
shows how narrow most others' ideas of revisionism really are.''
Algus himself seems to see it a little less earnestly. ``It's like
being a kid in a candy store,'' he says, referring not to the size
of his storefront but to his pleasure in immersing himself in art
that no one else seems to want anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the end of the war to the mid-70's, New York was it,'' he
explains. ``Now it's as though we're sitting around in Florence
after the Renaissance thinking that there were just a couple of
interesting artists.''
</P>
<P>
   The kind of art Algus shows _ the Color Field painting of Edward
Avedisian, the homoerotic hyper-realism of Harold Stevenson, the
``destruction art'' of the conceptualist Raphael Montanez Ortiz
(which indirectly inspired primal scream therapy) or the futuristic
polyester sculptures of Nancy Arlen _ actually recalls the period
between his first experiences of art and his own decision not to
make it himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was a dentist who had painters among his patients, and
there was always art around the house,'' says Algus, who grew up in
Brooklyn and on Long Island. ``I remember him taking me to the
Howard Wise Gallery to look at kinetic art.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his university major was in geology and he earned a
doctorate in the subject at McGill University, he ``spent a lot of
time in college and graduate school in the art library reading art
magazines,'' he recalls. He then began making art on his own as
well, exhibiting it in group shows at galleries around New York
including that of Pat Hearn.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, a friend, Leecha Jimenez, told him that she needed a
partner to help run her gallery in the Williamsburg section of
Brooklyn, where his sculpture had also been exhibited. ``Once I
started running the gallery I stopped making art,'' he recalls.
``I'd always been interested in Robert Mallary's sculpture, so I
just called him up.''
</P>
<P>
   (Mallary was a pioneer of ``junk art'' assemblage who later
became one of the first to try his hand at computer art. ``I found
him up at the University of Massachusetts. He opened up his barn
and there were all those pieces I'd seen in crummy black-and-white
illustrations. And a light went off. Everything I wanted to see in
my art was already out there, and I just had to find it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the year after his partnership with Ms. Jimenez
dissolved, he opened his Thompson Street gallery.
</P>
<P>
   It is Algus' way of seeing the art of 30 years ago with the eye
of a contemporary artist that gives his program more than
antiquarian interest, though he has the kind of microscopically
detailed familiarity with the period that allows him to casually
cite, for example, the time and place where Jules Olitski and
Stanley Twardowicz bought their first spray-guns together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about resurrecting anybody,'' says Mary K.
Weatherford, a painter who frequents the gallery. ``It's just about
showing interesting work that younger artists have absorbed through
osmosis without ever having actually seen it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another painter, David Reed, explains that in the case of an
artist like Krushenick, who made abstract painting with a Pop
sensibility, the very factor that led to the artist's fall into
obscurity is the one that makes him interesting today. ``Nick was
excluded from the history of Pop because his work has no figurative
content, yet it didn't fit in with what was going on with
abstraction, so it wasn't canonized there either,'' says Reed.
``But Pop in abstraction is very important to current painting, so
he turned out to be one of the most influential painters of his
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Algus is clearly delighted by the interest of the artists and
critics who can often be found chatting with him in the gallery.
``It's great when young artists come in,'' he says, ``and I'm
showing the work of someone like Wojciech Fangor, who they've never
heard of, and they say, `But that's what I've been trying to paint
in the studio!'''
</P>
<P>
   He laments, however, the indifference of collectors to his
efforts. When asked about sales, the answer comes quickly:
``Nothing. Nothing. Artists have bought, a couple of critics have
bought, but collectors? There aren't many who have the courage of
their own perceptions. It's just buzz. So if no one's bought the
work for 20 years _ they don't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're missing the real satisfaction of being able to deal
with major pieces,'' he continues. ``It's not like getting a
Lichtenstein print. You can get the best painting this artist ever
made.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   The gallery's supporters extend a similar critique to the museum
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a painter in New York since 1971, and before that a
student here, and there's a wonderful history that I'm aware of
because I've seen it,'' says Reed, ``but the museums aren't paying
attention to it. Instead this high school teacher steps in and does
it at one-one-thousandth of the cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Rubinstein agrees, saying that ``his program should be
putting pressure on MOMA and the Guggenheim to take another look at
what they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Storr, a curator at the Museum of Modern Art, disagrees.
``It's done all the time,'' he says. ``Laura Hoptman recently did a
show on Op Art here because it was something younger artists have
become interested in. What contemporary artists do always suggests
new ways of looking at the past. But you can't turn into the Museum
of Restored Reputations.''
</P>
<P>
   Another curator at a New York museum, who asked not to be
identified, concedes, however, that museums shy away from
re-examining underrated artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they should be looked at, but they're interesting mostly
for an art world insider audience, not a general audience, which is
what museums are looking for, with an eye on the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the same curator also points out that overlooked
artists still turn up at museums in group shows. The Algus
exhibition of Ortiz coincided with one at the Whitney, he notes,
and the painter-turned-conceptualist Lee Lozano's exhibition with a
show at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   According to Rubinstein, Algus is playing with the effects of
nearness and distance in history. ``He makes you realize how far
away we are from a time as recent as 35 years ago, yet he also
makes you realize its relevance, that it's not so distant after
all.'' His project may be less like that of other galleries, let
alone museums, than it is comparable to that of certain artists who
have systematically blurred the line between art making on the one
hand and curating or collecting on the other. He could be compared
to Jim Shaw, with his hoard of thrift-shop paintings, for instance,
or Douglas Blau, with his salon-style concatenations of
reproductions.
</P>
<P>
   For Algus, what counts may really be less what he shows, despite
his interest in the recent past as a historical context for today's
art, than how it is seen. When art is overlooked by the
institutions that interpret history, its meaning becomes equivocal.
``People don't know how to see this work,'' he says. ``It could be
conventional or it could be ironic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more fun to show work that's elusive in that way. It
becomes an internal dialogue about what you bring to it. You can
make up your own story.''

SPORTS COLUMN: DANES HOPE TO SILENCE THE AMERICAN PARTY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The official video promoting the Women's World Cup begins with
the Stars and Stripes. Then there is footage of Mia Hamm scoring a
goal. Next come more Stars and Stripes. Then a tape of the Olympic
gold-medal ceremony in Georgia in 1996. It is, shall we say, a
trifle jingoistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys are very good at that,'' said Lene Terp, the Denmark
captain, who noticed.
</P>
<P>
   The Danes are getting the feeling they are accessories to the
mission, the march of the Americans to the finals in the Rose Bowl,
theoretically after Norway and China finish beating each other up
in the other semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   This soccer tournament was made in America, by Americans, for
Americans, but the Danes are just worldly enough to see the bright
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``America's been very good for soccer,'' Terp said. ``We would
not have done the same stuff if we were the host.''
</P>
<P>
   The Danes and the 14 other countries find themselves as honored
guests at a party, and they all like the sound of the party, if not
the anticipated result. Over 460,000 tickets have been sold, an
average of 27,000 per event.
</P>
<P>
   When the Danes march onto the lovely lush green anti-Parcells
grass field of Giants Stadium with their American sisters on
Saturday, at least 74,000 seats will be occupied, and maybe all
77,000 by that time.
</P>
<P>
   The extremely impressive sales are a testimony to the American
women being 1991 World Cup champions and 1996 Olympic champions
(even if NBC could not interrupt its canned features in Atlanta to
show live women actually competing.)
</P>
<P>
   The sales are also a tribute to the business acumen of Marla
Messing, the president of the organizing committee, who admitted
she would like to see ``a little more parity'' in the promotion of
the World Cup, the way Germany and Brazil are always esteemed
visitors at every men's World Cup around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   There is the danger that the enthusiasm for the Americans could
obscure the progress in other countries in overcoming traditional
taboos against female competition. As Messing noted, this is only
the third women's cup, ``and we are swimming upstream.'' Besides,
she said, ``It is hard to get footage of other teams. There just
aren't that many tapes in the vault.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks have earned the triumphalism. With it goes the
American-style excess, some of it downright smarmy. ESPN has been
carrying a craven plea for President Clinton to attend the final in
the Rose Bowl, as if only the presidential presence would justify
what these female athletes do. With any luck, he won't show, and
mess up traffic, besides.
</P>
<P>
   However, Giants Stadium will be jammed on Saturday, and the
crowd will probably be even more one-sided than the audiences at
the 1984 Summer Games when those great Americans, Mickey and
Minnie, won most of the medals in the absence of most of the Soviet
bloc and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have 300 Danish people,'' proudly announced Jorgen
Hvidemose, the Danish coach. ``They will all be sitting together
waving Danish flags.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his players would be aware of their 300 fans among the
screaming Americans, he replied, ``When we go up, 2-0, you will be
able to hear them,'' a wry smile indicating he was joking.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's news conference in New York, Hvidemose showed
himself to be a Victor Borge without the piano. He insisted
somebody in Michigan (not a journalist, he assured us) once
informed him that Denmark was the capital of the Netherlands. He
also said that while waiting for the team bus in Montclair, N.J.,
the other day, he met an American who did not know where Denmark
was.
</P>
<P>
   The Danes, meanwhile, tend to speak perfect English _ and not
just Mikka Hansen, who grew up in California and played for Santa
Clara University and for the American under-21 team for a while,
before opting for Danish dual citizenship to play in this World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen said her teammates were not totally put off by the
newspaper coverage and the publicity for Hamm and the rest of the
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, `That's America,''' Hansen said. ``They're all
talking about what a great job the U.S. is doing. They're looking
forward to playing in front of 75,000 people. They don't mind if
Mia has the commercials. It's good for soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, an American title would be good for soccer in
the home of the gigantic corporations that could sponsor leagues
and tournaments. But an upset of Ms. Goliath would be popular all
over the world. The makers of the official 1999 film would have to
include a foreign championship somewhere between shots of the Stars
and Stripes. &QL;

BOEING WORKING ON COMMERCIAL VERSION OF C-17; A CUSTOMER WOULD
HELP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The Boeing Co. is quickly laying the groundwork for a
commercial version of its C-17 Air Force cargo plane.
</P>
<P>
   The certification process by the Federal Aviation Administration
began last month, and all that's needed before Boeing's board of
directors is asked to approve the launch of the MD-17 is a launch
customer, said Stu Thompson, vice president of business development
for Boeing's airlift and tanker group.
</P>
<P>
   At about $175 million a plane, the customer would have to have
very deep pockets. So to help reduce customer risk, Boeing is
taking a page from the fractional ownership concept _ multiple
owners or users of a single plane _ that has made the market for
business jets so successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bullish index on the MD-17 has increased,'' Thompson said
in an interview this week at the Paris Air Show.
</P>
<P>
   The C-17 was built by McDonnell Douglas, and the MD designation
for the commercial version did not change after the company's 1997
merger with Boeing. If a launch customer is signed up, a new
designation for the MD-17 will surely follow.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said he is much more optimistic today than he was a few
years ago that the MD-17 will become part of the Boeing commercial
airplane family.
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell Douglas was talking about the MD-17 as far back as
1994. Expectations were raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, we probably started too early,'' Thompson said.
``The program may not have been mature enough for us to be
promoting the MD-17 as early as we did.''
</P>
<P>
   The C-17 program came close to being canceled by the Air Force
in the early 1990s because of cost overruns and questions about
performance. But reforms demanded by the Pentagon were put into
place and the program was dramatically turned around.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force awarded McDonnell Douglas a multiyear contract for
120 planes, which are built in Long Beach, Calif. The 52nd plane
off the assembly line will be delivered to McChord Air Force Base
near Tacoma next month.
</P>
<P>
   Congress just approved funding for an additional 15 planes to be
used for special military operations.
</P>
<P>
   And Boeing recently made an unsolicited proposal to the Air
Force to sell the service 60 planes at an average cost of $149
million in 1999 dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Under its current contract with Boeing, the Air Force is paying
an average of $198 million in 1999 dollars for its final 80 planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see here is our business base expanding,'' Thompson
said. ``This provides a stable production base so we can consider
the commercial plane as more viable.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is now engaged in trade studies to evaluate the
commercial pricing structure for an MD-17, Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been out there in the commercial market place since
1996 with a catalogue price of $175 million flyaway cost for an
MD-17.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last summer, we began to read about what was happening in the
business jet market, with fractional ownership. The concept of a
shared risk to lower the entry barrier ... if we could find a way
to soften that huge initial acquisition cost, we might actually be
able to break down that barrier.''
</P>
<P>
   So Boeing began looking at a consortium approach to MD-17
ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Potential customers could come from the oil, construction or
aerospace industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a look at the order book for big satellites,'' Thompson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is astounding. People don't put satellites on trucks or in
the holds of ships.''
</P>
<P>
   The four-engine giant, 174 feet long with a wingspan of 170
feet, can carry a maximum payload of nearly 170,000 pounds and can
land on short runways of 3,000 feet or less.
</P>
<P>
   It was designed to carry some of the Army's biggest weapons,
including the Apache helicopter and the M-1 tank.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's huge An-124 has proved there is a civilian market for
such a plane. Even Boeing occasionally uses the Antonov plane to
transport big items.
</P>
<P>
   To develop the MD-17, Boeing would have to remove military-type
items from the plane. But that could be accomplished for much less
than it now costs Boeing to build a derivative of one of its
commercial jets, Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   A team from Boeing, the Air Force and the FAA are working on the
certification process that would be needed.
</P>
<P>
   When McDonnell Douglas first built the C-17, it was certified by
the Pentagon. The FAA may be able to get much of that flight test
data from the military, which could considerably shorten the
civilian flight test program.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing believes it can design, build and flight test the MD-17
within 36 months after it gets the green light from the board to
proceed with development.
</P>
<P>
   But that launch customer has still not come forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had a lot of interest, but so far no one has come
forward with a checkbook,'' Thompson said.

KOREAN CLASH MAY RUIN U.S. RECONCILIATION BID
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two weeks before North Korean and South Korean
gunboats opened fire on each other in disputed waters, former
Defense Secretary William Perry spent three days in the North
trying to get a government known for its paranoia to build a
relationship with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   During 15 hours of talks, Perry laid out a plan in which
President Clinton would lift economic sanctions gradually in return
for commitments from North Korea to stop testing missiles and
selling missile technology, and to expand a freeze on
nuclear-weapons development.
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans were suspicious, a member of Perry's party
said, suspecting a trap.
</P>
<P>
   But they were also intrigued, and ended the visit with a banquet
and floor show in which performers entertained Perry with a mix of
Korean revolutionary songs and American tunes, including ``Oh!
Susanna.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, only two weeks later, Perry's detailed proposals for
reconciliation are already in deep trouble _ perhaps a casualty of
the outbreak of shooting this week that resulted in the deaths of
at least 20 North Koreans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very damaging,'' said Donald Gregg, a former American
ambassador to South Korea who heads the Korea Society in New York.
``And like everything the North Koreans do, no one is entirely sure
why they did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress were suspicious of Perry's initiative
even before the confrontation, and several emerged from a
classified briefing last week noting that the North had indicated
no willingness to give up its ballistic missile program.
</P>
<P>
   Some hard-liners, led by Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman of New York,
had already introduced legislation that would tie Clinton's hands,
preventing him from lifting sanctions and blocking further aid to
the North until it makes major concessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This latest incident fit the standard model for North Korean
negotiations,'' Gilman said Wednesday in an interview. ``They
create a crisis. Then they demand concessions in return for backing
down. The Perry report, if and when we get it, should take into
account this kind of brinksmanship.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear when Perry will formally issue a report, or in
what form. While Clinton and the national security adviser, Sandy
Berger, have reportedly approved the strategy, the White House
played down Perry's mission and, so far, has offered no public
support for his proposals. In fact, administration officials have
refused to discuss his overtures to the North in public, saying
they fear that would undercut delicate diplomacy with a volatile
regime.
</P>
<P>
   Even within the Clinton administration, there is growing
skepticism that the North Koreans will take the deal, or that
Congress will go along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time the North Koreans do something defiant or something
stupid, all it does is harden the view that they could never be
trusted to execute whatever deal we strike,'' a senior
administration official involved in Korea policy said this week.
``If you think `engagement' is a hard sell with China, try it with
North Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   This week's gun battle on the seas off the Korean Peninsula was
particularly unsettling to the administration because it clearly
was more than a confrontation among hot-headed captains. It was
preceded by a standoff that lasted several days, as South Korean
ships tried to push the North's vessels, chiefly fishing craft
seeking crabs, back into Northern territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was plenty of time for North Korea's military leadership
to tell them to back off,'' said an official familiar with the
intelligence gathered from American and South Korean aircraft over
the area. ``But clearly they wanted to send a message that they
were not about to back down.''
</P>
<P>
   After the sinking of the North Korean torpedo boat, however,
Pyongyang did back off, clearly calculating that they were
outgunned.
</P>
<P>
   Equally interesting, the South Koreans backed off as well, and
President Kim Dae Jung, who arrives here next month for his second
visit to Washington, said he would not retreat from his ``sunshine
policy'' of expanded contacts with the North Koreans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a sign of a growing maturity on the part of South
Korea,'' said Gregg, whose long career with Korea included a tour
as the CI A's station chief there during other moments of tension
with North Korea. ``There is a confidence among the South Koreans
we did not used to see.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That confidence, however, is no assurance that Kim's policy or
Perry's congruent initiative will sell.
</P>
<P>
   The Perry effort hinges on what a State Department official
Wednesday called ``a broad vision of what a new relationship with
North Korea could look like.''
</P>
<P>
   At its core would be a series of commitments by the North, each
verifiable by inspections or American spy satellites, to halt
several projects that North Korean leaders have said are important
to their national or economic security.
</P>
<P>
   First would be an end to the testing of missiles, including the
medium-range missile that was launched over Japan last summer.
Pyongyang would also have to end its export of missile technology
to the Middle East and Pakistan, one of its few sources of hard
currency.
</P>
<P>
   It would also have to expand on the 1994 nuclear accord,
allowing broader inspections to dispel fears that it has simply
moved its nuclear-weapons projects to sites outside Yongbyon, the
frozen nuclear complex where that research was located.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't go there with the idea that they would say, `Great
idea. Where do we sign up?''' said the State Department official.
``But they also listened very intently, asked a lot of questions,
took copious notes.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Perry's interactions were with Kang Sok Ju, the
country's first vice foreign minister, who is regarded by American
intelligence officials as the civilian official closest to
President Kim Jong Il, the son of the North's late founder, Kim Il
Sung.
</P>
<P>
   President Kim declined to meet with Perry, though American
officials believe that he read a letter from Clinton that the
American delegation carried. The contents have not been made
public.
</P>
<P>
   Perry also met with Lt. Gen. Li Yong Chol, the director of the
national defense commission. Presumably, Li was in the chain of
command as North Korean forces engaged in Tuesday's firefight with
the South.

 KEEPING AOL FREE OF COOKIES  &HT;     By DAVID EINSTEIN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Q: On my computer at home I have successfully disabled cookies in
America Online. So imagine my surprise when I loaded AOL onto my PC
at the office, only to discover that the cookies options had
disappeared. What's the story, and is there an easy fix?
<P>
   A: The story is that the version of AOL you installed at work
doesn't give you cookie control. But you can remedy the situation
easily. Just install Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 on your office
PC (ask your systems people to do it for you or get their OK to do
it yourself).
</P>
<P>
   AOL, which comes with an earlier version of IE 4, will
automatically upgrade itself to use IE 5's preferences, including
cookie options. It's unfortunate that neither AOL nor Microsoft has
bothered to tell us about this curious relationship between the two
programs, but now you know.
</P>
<P>
   To set your cookie options, go to My AOL and choose Preferences.
Click the WWW icon, which brings up the window for AOL Internet
Properties. Tab over to Security and click the button for Custom
Level. Then scroll down until you get to the options for cookies.
</P>
<P>
   NO EXPRESS RECEIPTS
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was very much interested to learn in your column that I
could get a receipt when I sent e-mail. You showed how to do this
for Outlook and Netscape. I use Outlook Express and the
instructions provided do not apply. Can I request receipts with
Express, and if not, how do I switch from Express to Outlook?
</P>
<P>
   A: Outlook Express has no provision for receipts, which can tell
you when an e-mail message you've sent has been received and/or
opened. But hey, the program is free, so you can't complain too
much. Switching to Outlook will cost you, because that program is
part of the Microsoft Office suite (which also includes Word,
Excel, etc.) And Office is expensive. The standard upgrade version
of Office 2000 costs $250, and the full version is $450. My advice
would be to use Netscape, or maybe another free program such as
Pegasus, which also supports receipts. You can download Pegasus
from &LR;   &LR; www.pegasus.usa.com.
</P>
<P>
   You know what I do sometimes when I send an important e-mail? I
include a blind copy to myself. It's not as good as a receipt, but
if I get the copy back, I at least know that the message went
through the Internet the way it was supposed to. So you might try
that as a way to put your mind at rest.
</P>
<P>
   TO BUY OR LEASE
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm wondering about different ways to finance a new PC. I
know you can purchase one over time from Gateway. Dell, on the
other hand, offers what it calls a ``personal lease'' program that
I assume is like leasing a car. Which of these options do you think
is the better deal?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm thinking that financing a computer from Gateway is a
better deal than leasing one from Dell. Either way, you'll spend
about $1,775 over two years _ $74 a month _ for a $1,500 computer.
But at the end of that time, you'll own the Gateway. With the Dell,
you'll have to pay 22 percent of the original price to buy the
computer after the lease. Also, Gateway lets you trade in your
computer for a new one (the trade-in allowance is the wholesale
value of the computer at the time of the trade-in).
</P>
<P>
   TRANSLATION UPDATE: Last time, I gave out the address of a site
run by AltaVista that offers free online translations between
English and several European languages. Some readers responded that
they couldn't access the site. Invariably, it was because they were
adding ``www'' to the address by mistake. Just enter
babelfish.altavista.com/cgi-bin/translate? and that should do it.
(Remember to include the question mark at the end.)
</P>
<P>
   On the same subject, a few readers said the site doesn't do a
great job of translating. Some of the words they used to describe
it were ``garbled'' and ``garbage.'' So maybe a software package
such as Power Translator Pro from Lernout &AMP; Hauspie ($130),
Universal Translator from Language Force ($40) and Easy Translator
from Transparent Language ($42) is your best bet after all.
</P>
<P>
   TIP OF THE WEEK: When you conduct a search on the Internet for a
name or phrase, search engines typically go out and find thousands
_ sometimes millions _ of results that include any of your search
words. But there is a way to narrow your searches considerably.
Just enclose your search phrase in quotation marks. That tells the
search engine to look for only the exact phrase.

U.S. INDICTS 2 MORE MEN IN EMBASSY BOMBINGS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two men who the authorities say are leaders of an
Islamic terrorist organization were indicted Wednesday by a federal
grand jury in Manhattan on charges that they had a hand in the
bombing last summer of two American embassies in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say the two, Ayman al-Zawahiri and Khalid al-Fawwaz,
are close associates of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who has
been charged with ordering the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania,
killing hundreds of people and injuring 4,000. The indictment also
charged both men with conspiring to kill Americans around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Like bin Laden, neither man is in U.S. custody, although Fawwaz
is being held by British authorities and is awaiting an extradition
hearing that could order him to New York for prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Zawahiri is thought to be in Afghanistan along with bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's indictments raise the number of those charged in the
bombings to 15; five of the defendants are being held in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   In a detailed indictment issued by the U.S. attorney for the
Southern District of New York, Mary Jo White, both men are
described as vital members of bin Laden's organization, Al Qaeda,
who were intimately involved in planning the Aug. 7 bombings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's indictment underscores our resolve to bring to the bar
of justice each and every person who participated in these heinous
crimes that resulted in the death of hundreds of innocent people,
both American and foreign nationals of all religions,'' said Ms.
White. ``The charges also show the reach of the worldwide terrorist
network threatening civilized society.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that Fawwaz has been running media operations
for Al Qaeda; his duties include publicizing statements made by bin
Laden, recruiting military trainees, transmitting confidential
messages to members and purchasing communications equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also believe that Fawwaz was instrumental in
disseminating bin Laden's fatwahs, or death sentences, including
those that ordered Muslims to kill Americans anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Officials charge that after the bombings, Fawwaz helped forward
messages to various media outlets claiming responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Zawahiri was a leader in al Jihad, a terrorist organization that
authorities believe was responsible for the assassination of
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. In 1995, the organization's leader,
Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, was convicted in a plot to bomb New York
City landmarks, including the World Trade Center. Three years
later, his group merged with bin Laden's Al Qaeda.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Katzman, a senior analyst for the Congressional Research
Service, described Zawahiri as a military expert and a top
lieutenant in Al Qaeda. ``Once he lost his patron, he came under
the wing of bin Laden, who has the organization and the money,''
Katzman said. He added that Zawahiri is wanted by Egypt for his
role in the assassination of Sadat.
</P>
<P>
   When the United States attacked bin Laden's headquarters in
response to the embassy bombings, Zawahiri called a Pakistani
newspaper and issued a threatening response. ``The war has just
started,'' he told a reporter. ``The Americans should wait for the
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Zawahiri could receive the death penalty,
according to the indictment. Fawwaz faces a maximum sentence of
life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, the indictment
says.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the government indicted Ali A. Mohamed, a former
U.S. Army sergeant, on charges of collaborating with bin Laden in a
conspiracy to kill Americans abroad, asserting for the first time
that Al Qaeda was behind the embassy attacks in Africa. U.S.
officials claim that Al Qaeda plotted against the United States for
arresting and prosecuting its members and those affiliated with its
terrorist groups, including Abdel-Rahman.
</P>
<P>
   There are $5 million rewards for the fugitives, including bin
Laden, who was recently placed on the FBI's 10 most wanted list.

<P>
   KORENICA, Yugoslavia _ For the last four days, Tom Dedaj has
been going house to house in search of the unburied horrors of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   They are not hard to find here. A severed foot lies on the grass
of the cemetery. Three doors down from his house, the charred
bodies of five friends are strewn in a rubble-filled room. His own
aunt lies, a mass of lumps and ashes, in her front hallway.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he took a lawyer with Human Rights Watch on a tour
of what he had found, as Kosovo's tragedy entered its next phase:
documenting exactly what has happened since March, with an eye
toward punishing the guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts of killings of civilians in Kosovo have so far been
secondhand _ or even more distant _ based on interviews in refugee
camps in Macedonia and Albania, with no way to confirm the reports.
</P>
<P>
   Now that NATO peacekeepers and other outsiders have entered the
province, they are collecting evidence in village after village in
an attempt to assemble a complete picture of the civilian toll of
the Kosovo war.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on investigation is evident around the province as
NATO troops, who have been in Kosovo only since Saturday, have
moved to secure sites where mass killings are said to have been
carried out. In fact, Wednesday morning, Brigadier Gen. Fritz von
Korff, the commander of the German sector, which has several mass
grave cites, told reporters that NATO would start using the phrase
``crime scene'' instead of ``mass grave.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, there is no evidence of massacres of the astonishing
scale of the one in Srebrenica, the village in Bosnia where Serbian
forces killed as many as 7,000 people in 1995. But after only a few
days of open access to Kosovo, it is becoming clear there may be
hundreds and hundreds of smaller sites with numbers of victims
ranging from one or two to perhaps several hundred.
</P>
<P>
   And while most victims are buried under newly churned earth, it
is also clear, from a tour of this village and several others
within a few miles, that there is much evidence in plain view.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing several sites Wednesday, including Korenica and
Meja _ and finding more than a dozen unburied bodies _ the Human
Rights Watch lawyer, Joanne Mariner, said she could draw a few
preliminary conclusions about the deaths of civilians: ``We knew a
lot of people were killed but we're finding a lot more than we
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You add it up and it adds up to a lot of deaths,'' she said.
``It's systematic. There were a lot of people involved. It wasn't
some aberration that people were killed.''
</P>
<P>
   But proving exactly what happened _ and exactly who did what _
may be a difficult task. Ms. Mariner said that even after extensive
interviews with refugees, and the beginnings of interviews inside
Kosovo, she has heard relatively few names of people accused of the
killings. Some of the killers were masked, she said witnesses told
her; some were strangers. Often there were no witnesses at all.
</P>
<P>
   And finding witnesses who can agree on details of killings is
equally hard. There is no doubt that many people were killed here,
and in the neighboring village of Meja, just outside Djakovica. But
the accounts can be strikingly different.
</P>
<P>
   In Meja, the remains of six men, all in civilian clothes, still
lie scattered around a ditch. One man in a leather jacket had no
head. A pair of pants was filled by a single leg, with a black shoe
and blue sock still at the end of it. A stretch of ground near a
cemetery, apparently the killing ground, is littered with human
teeth, bits of skull and the pink plastic of shattered dentures.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, refugees and villagers say there appeared to be
two sets of killings on the same day: In Meja, Serbian forces and
paramilitaries, they say, separated the men from women and children
in a huge convoy of ethnic Albanians fleeing from Kosovo on April
27, killing between 100 and 300 of the men.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Korenica, villagers say that these same forces killed as
many as 100 more people, burning many of them in their own homes:
Dedaj, a 38-year-old farmer, recognized his aunt by the jewelry on
the floor and a necklace she had tucked away in her bra. He
recognized an 80-year-old man by a metal box he found next to the
body with the man's pocket watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a person who is mentally ill or sick can do this,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Both mass killings appeared to be in retaliation for an attack
by the Kosovo Liberation Army in Meja in which five Serbian police
officers were killed.
</P>
<P>
   But Kurtshtest Morina, a 30-year-old sanitation worker, said
Wednesday that it was his job to drive people from where they were
killed to the cemetery in Korenica and he saw at most 40 bodies in
the last few months.
</P>
<P>
   He is a Gypsy and was not targeted by Serbian forces as the
ethnic Albanians were. He conceded that Serbian forces might have
buried more bodies on their own, but he had not heard of hundreds
of people being killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might have been more that I haven't seen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Morina said that the Serbian forces were meticulous about how
they buried the dead.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``They would take pictures of the bodies,'' he said. ``They
would write down the names of the dead. They would attach a number
to the corpse. And according to that number they would bury the
body.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the grave would have a number,'' he said. ``They were
very organized.''
</P>
<P>
   The same questions and contradictions are surfacing in other
areas of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In Drenica, the heartland of the Kosovo Liberation Army, a day
after Serbian forces largely withdrew, signs of death were
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   In the village of Makermal, near Drenica, Habib Gjinovci, a
farmer and KLA fighter, was trying to figure out whose blackened
skull was lying in the charred wreckage of his corn hutch. He said
the remains he found might be those of a teen-age boy Serbs
captured a month ago with roughly 20 others.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the size of the skull, it could be a woman or a child,''
he said. ``There were some kids who were 14 or 15 arrested that
day.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Serbs withdrew from the village on Monday, returning
Albanians found eight fresh graves in the cemetery. They dug up two
of them and found several sets of charred bones in each grave, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the village of Rezalle, KLA, soldiers dug up what they
thought would be a mass grave only to find a dead cow.
</P>
<P>
   Two local Albanian rebels said the grave formerly held the
bodies of 50 to 80 Albanians killed by Serbian soldiers on April 5.
Observing from across the front line, the two soldiers, Aziz Aruqa
and Musa Derguti, said that they saw Serbs bury the bodies in the
mass grave. But two weeks ago the Serbs returned with heavy
equipment, removed the bodies and then shot cows and buried them in
the pit, the soldiers said.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees who fled Poklek, a KLA-controlled village at the
southern end of the Drenica region in May, carried with them the
tale of a mass killing of women and children there April 17.
</P>
<P>
   The home of Qamil Mucolli, the scene of the deaths, has become a
shrine to the 50 people killed that day. Mucolli, a 27-year-old KLA
fighter, said his wife, his two small daughters, his parents and
four sisters were among those killed when a Serbian soldier threw a
hand grenade into the crowded first-floor room. Mucolli, who was
fighting with the rebels at the time, said he understood that the
Serbian assailant then opened fire with his assault rifle, killing
all but four of the people inside. The Serbs burnt the bodies that
day in the room where they died, leaving it charred. Later the
rebels collected the bones for safekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in his basement, Mucolli pointed out how blood from the
first floor had trickled down through the ceiling and along the
basement walls to form dark red pools on the floor. Two months
after the attack, the pools of blood are black and untouched except
by the mold growing on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not cleaned it,'' he said, ``because we want everyone
to see the evidence.''

   PINEHURST, N.C. _ If there's a ``home pro'' for the 99th U.S.
Open that begins Thursday at Pinehurst No. 2, it's Davis Love III.
As a youngster, he often accompanied his father, a storied teaching
pro, to Golf Digest schools here. As a three-time all-American at
the University of North Carolina, he played here in the prestigious
North and South Amateur, winning it in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot of little things that have been important to
my game,'' he said. ``This was my favorite place to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 35-year-old Davis Love III is among the favorites to win the
first Open here at the Pinehurst Resort and Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just remember spending a lot of time pounding balls here
with my Dad and Jack Lumpkin,'' he said, referring to another Golf
Digest pro. ``I remember Jack teaching me how to pitch in one of
the deep holes on the side of the 15th green, how to get the ball
up in the air. I remember winning the long-drive contest off the
14th tee here at No. 2.''
</P>
<P>
   How far had he hit it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said with a slow smile. ``Longer than
everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for John Daly, Tiger Woods and maybe David Duval, he
still does.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Open is special for me,'' Love said. ``I get to go to the
Pine Crest Inn and the Carolina Hotel and my friends are in town
and that's where the sentiment comes in. And we've never seen a
town and fans so excited. They are nuts about it and it's great to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Pine Crest Inn, for $1 or more a shot, you can chip a
golf ball off a mat on the lobby floor at a hole in a target in
front of the fireplace. If you chip it through the hole, you
collect whatever money has accumulated from all those who have
missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to do that,'' Love said, ``but the line is too long
this week.''
</P>
<P>
   But when he played in the North and South Amateur in this
pine-shaded village with 38 golf courses, he must have collected a
Pine Crest pot or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I ever won that game,'' he said. ``I couldn't
chip in college.''
</P>
<P>
   He can chip now. On the PGA Tour he's won more than $11.4
million ($1.4 million this year) and 13 tournaments, including one
major, the 1997 Professional Golfers Association Championship at
Winged Foot. If he hadn't three-putted the final hole at the 1996
Open at Oakland Hills, he would have been in an 18-hole playoff
with Steve Jones.
</P>
<P>
   More than most of the Open golfers, Love understands the nuances
of Pinehurst No. 2's turtleback greens, softened by Wednesday
evening's rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it won't be a chipping contest,'' he said. ``I think Tiger
summed it up, saying you have to hit the ball in the fairway enough
times to get the ball on the green and have some chances for
birdies. You're not going to win unless you make some birdies.
Nobody is going to make 72 straight pars and win. It's going to be
who can be the most patient and put their misses in the right
spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miss the second green too long every day and you can make
three pars and a bogey. Miss it short and right every day and you
make three bogeys and a double.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where you're going to have to be patient enough to say,
`Look, I can't shoot at any pins on the right front of that green,
I have to keep it over to the left.' And when you get to the fifth
green, you can't miss it short and left. Every miss has to be long.
And playing that kind of patience game is going to be hard. I think
that's where it's going to be won and lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the rough will be kept at 3 inches, instead of the
Open's usual 4 to 5 inches, Love expected more double bogeys than
usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``With normal U.S. Open rough, you hit it in there, hack it out,
hit it on the green and one putt or two putt,'' he said. ``But
here, a guy that hits it over the third green, he might be talking
to guys down on the fifth green, deciding who's away.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't smiling now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hit a little flier over the 14th green, which I've done in the
North and South, and it's down on the 10th fairway,'' he said.
``You could see some big, big numbers because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Davis Love III dismisses the value of his personal sentiment
for Pinehurst.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start playing,'' he said, ``you better start hitting
the fairways and the greens, or sentiment is not going to help you
very much.''  &QL;

AIRPLANE MAKERS KNOW HOW TO PLAY NUMBERS GAME ON JET ORDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The aircraft order game was in full evidence Wednesday
at the halfway mark of the Paris Air Show.
</P>
<P>
   And like Alice in Wonderland, things keep getting curiouser and
curiouser.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus Industrie, whose just-launched A318 is in a dogfight with
Boeing's new 717 that has been making daily demonstration flights
for air show crowds, held a news conference with its top guy,
managing director Noel Forgeard, to announce that it had won 60
firm orders from International Lease Finance Corp., 30 of which
were for the A318.
</P>
<P>
   Only 24 hours earlier, Steven Udvar-Hazy, president and chief
executive officer of International Lease, had stood with Boeing
commercial boss Alan Mulally and announced an order for 50
next-generation 737s with options for 50 more _ a nearly $5 billion
deal that, with options, would be Boeing's largest ever for the
next-generation 737.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Udvar-Hazy and Forgeard were announcing an even
bigger firm order for the Airbus A320 family, which now includes
the A318.
</P>
<P>
   But wait a minute. Hadn't International Lease announced at the
Farnborough Air Show outside London last September that it would
order 30 of the A318s?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Udvar-Hazy acknowledged in response to questions, but at
the time International Lease was only making a commitment to buy
the Airbus plane. Since the A318 program had yet to be officially
launched, the orders had not been firm. Now they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first firm order for the A318,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a press release, Airbus said the same thing: ``The
announcement marks the first firm order for the A318.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait another minute.
</P>
<P>
   In April, when Airbus called a news conference to announce the
formal launch of the A318, Forgeard said the European airplane
maker had 109 firm orders, including the 30-plane International
Lease order as well as orders by Air France, TWA and AirEgypt.
</P>
<P>
   TWA had announced earlier in the year that it would buy 50
Boeing 717s and 50 Airbus A318s.
</P>
<P>
   Since April, newspaper and trade magazine stories that have been
written about the Boeing and Airbus 100-seat airplanes have
referred to the 109 firm orders for the A318 and the 115 firm
orders for Boeing's plane.
</P>
<P>
   It was only recently revealed in a published report by Flight
International that the April announcement by Forgeard was a bit
premature, and that the Airbus supervisory board had not yet given
its OK to launch the A318.
</P>
<P>
   The hangup was a dispute between the German Airbus partner
DaimlerChrysler Aerospace and Aerospatiale Matra, the French Airbus
partner.
</P>
<P>
   Aerospatiale wanted the A318 to be assembled in Toulouse, where
it builds the A320 and the widebody Airbus planes. DaimlerChrysler
wanted to assemble the new plane in Hamburg. The A318 is a
shortened version of the A319, which is assembled in Hamburg.
</P>
<P>
   As part of an agreement reached days before the Paris show
opened Saturday, Hamburg will get to assemble the A318, but some
A319 assembly work will be shifted to Toulouse. That settlement
cleared the way for the official launch of the A318.
</P>
<P>
   Forgeard was asked Wednesday if the previously announced 109
firm orders for the A318 are actually firm or merely ``letters of
intent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are more than that,'' Forgeard said. They are a
memorandum of understanding. That's to say, firm commitments with
down payments. He said Airbus ``expects'' firm orders from ``most''
of the previously announced A318 customers.
</P>
<P>
   An Airbus executive said later the consortium was ``close'' to
signing firm deals with the previously announced A318 customers.
</P>
<P>
   But people familiar with the matter say Air France is not happy
with the choice of Pratt &AMP; Whitney as the A318 engine maker, and
TWA has so far balked at officially signing a firm deal.
</P>
<P>
   Udvar-Hazy said after the announcement that International Lease
has so far commitments for nine of the A318s from airlines, but he
would not identify them.
</P>
<P>
   One of those customers is thought to be Northwest. If that's so,
it would be a blow to Boeing's 717.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is pushing the 717 as a replacement for the aging fleet
of DC-9s, and Northwest has the largest DC-9 fleet still flying _
nearly 200 planes. Both Airbus and Boeing executives have been
heavily courting Northwest to buy their 100-seaters.
</P>
<P>
   The A318s will be delivered beginning in 2002, the earliest
Airbus will have them ready.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 30 A318s, Udvar-Hazy also announced that
International Lease has ordered a mix of 30 Airbus A320s, A319s and
A321. He described them as firm orders. At least three of the
orders have been previously announced by Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aircraft have been ordered,'' he said. ``As usual, because
of the volume there is flexibility of model type .... that's
important since many will not be delivered for three, four or five
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Boeing nor Airbus ever disclose the value of the orders
they receive. Reporters come up with a value based on the list
price of the various planes, but the list price depends on the
configuration of the particular plane ordered. So at best it's an
educated guess.
</P>
<P>
   And even if that educated guess is close to the actual list
price, Airbus and Boeing customers get discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how much of a discount International Leasing received for
the 60 Airbus planes, Udvar-Hazy said, ``we paid a reasonable
price.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Boeing knows how to play the numbers game, too.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say Boeing executives were concerned in the last weeks
before the Paris Air Show that the company would be shut out of a
major order announcement, leaving the important world stage to
Airbus. So Boeing convinced International Lease to go ahead and
announce the 100-plane deal even though final details still had to
be worked out, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The first question Udvar-Hazy was asked after Tuesday's
100-plane announcement was whether International Lease and Boeing
had actually signed the deal.
</P>
<P>
   No, Udvar-Hazy said, the papers have not been signed. But they
will be, he said, probably next month.

MICROSOFT CALLS ITS OWN CHARACTER WITNESS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At its antitrust trial, the Microsoft Corp.
Wednesday presented its leading character witness, a folksy,
plain-spoken industry veteran who delivered a message that pleased
Microsoft's lawyers but will surely make its marketing executives
cringe.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony that traced his 25 years in the business, Gordon E.
Eubanks Jr. portrayed the software business as an entrepreneurial
hotbed, fast changing and fluid, where today's dominant company can
quickly become tomorrow's also-ran.
</P>
<P>
   And Microsoft is under threat today, Eubanks said, because the
center of gravity in computing is shifting rapidly beyond what he
called the ``PC centric world'' ruled by Microsoft and its Windows
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The key, Eubanks told the court, is that software programmers
are writing more and more programs to run on Internet technology,
notably on browsing software, instead of on Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The momentum of development for writing programs has gone to
the browser,'' testified Eubanks, president of Oblix, a Silicon
Valley start-up.
</P>
<P>
   The browser comment _ though meant to suggest that Microsoft is
no entrenched monopolist _ supports the government's case,
according to David Boies, the Justice Department's lead trial
lawyer. The government charges that Microsoft illegally moved to
thwart competition in the browser market because the browser can
serve as an alternative technology to the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made our point _ the importance of the browser _ and
Microsoft's use of its monopoly power to protect its operating
system monopoly and to extend its monopoly into Internet
software,'' Boies said after Eubanks left the stand.
</P>
<P>
   During his afternoon cross-examination, Boies attacked the
credibility of Eubanks as a witness, portraying him as a Microsoft
ally and dependent. To try to undercut his testimony, the
government introduced documents and e-mail showing that at his
current company and at Symantec Corp., where Eubanks was chief
executive until earlier this year, peaceful accommodation with
Microsoft was a priority.
</P>
<P>
   The government introduced a 1997 agreement stating that
Symantec, best known for its Norton Utilities and anti-virus
software, would get ``early access'' to Windows technology in
return for agreeing to make Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser
its favored, or default, browser and using Microsoft's version of
Java, an Internet programming language created by Sun Microsystems
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Presented with a copy, Eubanks said he was ``not aware'' of that
stipulation in the contract. And a Microsoft lawyer said Wednesday
night that those provisions of the contract were never invoked.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination, Eubanks said that he agreed to testify
on Microsoft's behalf after he was asked to by Bill Gates, the
Microsoft chairman. He also said that Microsoft had asked him to
write opinion pieces favorable to Microsoft for the Op-Ed pages of
newspapers, and that he had.
</P>
<P>
   The government also introduced an e-mail from the chairman of
his current employer, Oblix, saying the company depended on its
relationship with Microsoft, adding, ``We need to be totally in bed
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The government even introduced internal Microsoft e-mail
suggesting rankings of ``friend, enemy or neutral,'' for software
companies. The document came from another antitrust suit against
Microsoft, and according to a Microsoft lawyer dealt with a
suggested list of companies that might receive royalty waivers from
Microsoft. The recommendations were never carried out, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Eubanks described the software industry as one that lends itself
to ``natural monopolies'' for periods of five to 10 years, but that
these dominant companies over the years have all been unseated by
the next wave of technology.
</P>
<P>
   Eubanks was called by Microsoft to explain the industry context
for the court. He has no firsthand knowledge of the business
practices and disputed episodes that are at the center of the
government's suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government would have you believe that somehow this
industry is not working properly,'' said William H. Neukom,
Microsoft's general counsel. ``This is a witness for the
proposition that this industry is working just fine _ that it is
highly competitive, innovative and entrepreneurial.''

&HT;    THE BIG CITY YANKEE TRASH MAY PRESERVE A REBEL SHRINE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)  By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLES CITY , Va. _ Robert E. Lee played as a child under this
tree,'' Charles H. Carter III said on Tuesday, speaking of his
first cousin five times removed. Carter was standing by the
enormous willow oak on the front lawn of his home, Shirley
Plantation, on a bluff above the James River.
</P>
<P>
   Carter is the 10th generation of his family to live on this
land, which was settled in 1613, just six years after the founding
of the Jamestown colony down the river. Today it is still a working
plantation that grows wheat, corn, cotton and soybeans, although
most of the family's income comes from the tourists who file
through the landmark mansion and stroll around the elegant lawns
and gardens.
</P>
<P>
   It is Carter's ambition to carry on the family tradition and
preserve these bucolic 700 acres, 20 miles southeast of Richmond.
To do that, he wants New York City trash by the bargeload, and he
has gone to court to get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may struggle to understand how solid waste fits into
the picture here,'' he said. ``Reporters love to write about
bringing New York garbage into the home of Robert E. Lee's mother.
But I'd never do anything to hurt my own backyard, and I'd never
jeopardize our tourist business.'' He pointed a half-mile away to a
stand of trees hiding a cove with a new port ready to receive
sealed containers of trash.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't see it, smell it or hear it,'' he said. ``The only
impact of the trash will be to help us keep this plantation the way
it is. We need the income to preserve the buildings and the
paintings and the grounds, and to pay the inheritance taxes so it
stays in the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's $15 million container port, named Port Tobacco, was
paid for by Waste Management Inc., the operator of the nearby
landfill, where the trash would be taken by truck. But the cranes
are sitting idle because of a new state law. The Virginia
legislature, responding to the recent outcry from some politicians
and journalists over the importing of Yankee trash, banned the
shipping of garbage on the James River.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to overturn the law, Carter filed suit earlier this
month along with the landfill company, the barge company and the
Charles City County government. The prospect of diminished revenues
from the landfill has forced Charles City County to raise taxes and
make cutbacks in its schools and police force.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes no sense to ban just trash from the river,'' Carter
said. ``Right now six million tons of commercial cargo go by this
house every year, and well over two million tons are classified as
hazardous. There are industrial chemicals like carbolic acid and
sulfuric acid, plus oil and aviation fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trash is not even classified as a hazardous material. There'd
be at most one barge every two days, and you would't even be able
to tell it from a barge carrying containers of televisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Mmaybe the problem is the trash's provenance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were getting the trash from North Carolina,'' Carter
said, ``it'd probably be: `Y'all come back now and bring some
more.' They'd name the barge the Bobby Lee and everybody'd be
happy. There's a special hatred for New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter was appalled by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's lack of
political finesse in January, when the mayor mentioned the
``reciprocal relationship'' between Virginians visiting New York's
cultural attractions and New Yorkers who need a place to throw
their garbage. But Carter understood the point that Giuliani had
been trying to make about the comparative advantages of a crowded
city and a sparsely populated area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two-way trade is in both sides' economic interest,'' Carter
said. ``That's why this plantation was established here. The James
River was the nation's first commercial highway. My ancestors had a
port here to ship tobacco and lumber and other raw materials to
London, and their ships would come back with finished goods. Now
the market's New York, and we're essentially trading them the air
space in our landfill for their really finished goods.''

committee's chairman, and John LaFalce, D-N.Y., would also urge
international financial institutions to offer the world's poorest
countries more debt relief than now provided under a 1996
initiative of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
Additionally, the Leach-LaFalce plan would provide more relief than
the proposal that President Clinton will promote when he meets this
weekend in Cologne, Germany, with the heads of state from six
industrialized powers and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But does the Leach-LaFalce bill, let alone the president's plan,
go far enough? No, says Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Harvard
Institute for International Development. He applauds Leach for
pressuring the administration to seek more debt relief. But, he
says, proposals that only partly wipe out the debt of the worst-off
countries are inadequate. Many heavily indebted countries cannot
afford to repay their loans, and, he said, ``nobody with good sense
would want them to.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider the 700 million people living in the 41 poorest, most
indebted countries. They live on an average of about $4 a day; many
survive on less than $1 a day. Yet these countries are expected to
repay about $130 billion in loans from the IMF, World Bank and
Western countries.
</P>
<P>
   The fund and the bank began a program in 1996 to solve the
problem, focusing on about two dozen countries for relief. Under
the program, countries that undertake economic reforms overseen by
the IMF would _ after six years _ qualify for enough relief to
reduce the ratio of their remaining debt to their export revenues
to between 200 and 250 percent. Three years later, only three
nations have qualified. Many economists say the program leaves
crushing levels of debt in place.
</P>
<P>
   The Leach-LaFalce plan would focus on more than 40 countries and
reduce their debt payments to 10 percent of government revenues,
probably about half the level of the president's proposal. Under
the Leach-LaFalce plan, the United States would forgive almost all
its $6 billion in loans to those nations and require them to spend
the savings on education, health and other social needs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan would cut the debt of those countries by at least
$70 billion beyond the current IMF-World Bank program. It sets some
of the same targets as the Leach-LaFalce bill does, and would also
require the countries to use debt relief to strengthen health and
education programs. The administration does not think it can
convince leaders from the other Western powers to do more than it
has already proposed.
</P>
<P>
   But Sachs argues that much more _ complete debt forgiveness _ is
desperately needed for perhaps 25 of the 40 countries. And he
provided Leach's committee with data to show that forgiveness is
affordable.
</P>
<P>
   He starts with the IMF. The 40 countries owe it about $8
billion. He notes that the fund owns gold worth, at market prices,
more than $30 billion, but it carries the gold on its books at only
about $5 billion. By recognizing the true value of its gold
reserves and selling modest amounts over time, Sachs suggests, the
fund could write off loans to poor countries yet leave its balance
sheet looking better than under current accounting rules.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs also shows that the World Bank could easily afford to
write off unsubsidized loans. He concedes that the bank would need
extra money from rich nations to continue issuing as many
subsidized loans. Yet, even if it is forced to curtail such
lending, the most heavily indebted countries might not be worse
off. For many, the combination of less debt and fewer loans would
be better than the current situation, in which they wind up
repaying the bank with one hand the money they borrow with the
other.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs estimates the cost to the United States of writing off
loans would also be small. The $6 billion in loans to the worst-off
countries is truly worth only about $600 million, he said, the most
that the United States could expect to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the numbers hovers the issue of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any attempt to collect debt payments from these countries,''
Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., said, ``starts from the false premise
that they owe the money. But why should a fisherman off the coast
of Ghana set aside two extra fish to pay for lavish spending by
former tyrants?''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, he said, ``these loans were not loans at all.
They were grants for political purposes, like winning the Cold
War.''

FEW IN REDMOND, WASH., GET STIRRED UP LIVING RIGHT NEXT TO
PIPELINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDD SLIVKA  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ The Hausermans were watching television in
their family room when the news about the Bellingham pipeline
explosion came on.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't get too excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vern,'' Nadenne asked, turning in her chair to face her
husband. ``Isn't that what we have outside the house?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah, we have a natural gas pipeline out there,'' Vern said,
believing it. But the pipeline 28 steps from the front door of the
Hausermans' ranch-style house carries petroleum products _ just
like the one that ruptured and caught fire last week in Bellingham,
Wash., killing three people. In fact, it's the same pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline, owned by the Olympic Pipe Line Co., is just part
of the geography in the section of Redmond between Northeast 60th
and Northeast 80th streets, a fact of life. The way it is along
Hanna and Whatcom creeks in Bellingham, and throughout Western
Washington from Cherry Point near the Canadian border to the
Columbia River.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline started flowing in 1965 and predates nearly all of
the homes, the junior high school across the road, the once-swanky
apartment complex around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors either don't think about it or don't know it exists.
It's a lot like the family uncle who's gone to prison: No one
thinks about him until he calls collect to tell you he's been
released and needs a ride from the bus station.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no pipeline back there,'' says Rich, a Microsoft
employee who lives on 135th Place Northeast, gesturing out his back
window. ``Power lines, yes. Pipeline, no.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim, a mother of two who lives on 137th Avenue Northeast, knows
about the pipeline but doesn't care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no concerns about it,'' she said. ``It's just there.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Olympic pipeline was permitted in 1962, Redmond's
population was 1,426, and much of eastern King County was
undeveloped farmland. So why not put a petroleum pipeline there, or
a natural gas pipeline such as the Williams pipeline, less than a
mile west?
</P>
<P>
   Eastside development was sparse. Who could have predicted then
that Redmond would have more than 40,000 people? Or who would have
foreseen the extent of the Eastside boom, when grazing land got
plowed under for subdivisions?
</P>
<P>
   ``The pipeline has been operating for 34 years,'' Olympic
spokesman Joann Hamick said. ``We didn't encroach upon them. We've
been encroached upon.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the pipeline became incorporated into the area's
geography, something to be considered by builders as they put up
ranch houses along streets that dipped and swayed like the country
lanes they were supposed to emulate.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulations mandate how deep the pipeline needs to be,
how far back structures are supposed to. But it's up to the local
governments to decide nearby land use.
</P>
<P>
   ``The regulation says that if the pipe is buried only 3 feet
deep, structures are not supposed to be any closer than 50 feet to
the pipe,'' Hamick said. ``That's not the easement. That's how
close they can be to the pipe. If the pipe is buried 4 feet or
more, then there is no setback.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond has no rules about building right up to the easement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't regulate private companies in that regard,'' said
Scott Thomasson, the city's utility engineering manager. The city
follows the same policy with public-utility easements, believing
that the right of way provides a sufficient buffer.
</P>
<P>
   So people do build up to the easement, and residents rarely
think about the pipeline, though it runs under the track of Rose
Hill Junior High School, not more than 200 feet away from the
girls' locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Principal Steve Mezzich has been at Rose Hill for a year, and
didn't know of the pipeline's existence until Wednesday, though the
school's track team does endurance training by running up and down
the hill between pipeline markers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't bother me, really,'' Mezzich said. ``We have the
power lines, and apparently a pipeline, too. I guess I'll just have
to think that the tragic accident in Bellingham was the exception
and not the rule.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easier to focus on the power lines, and so the pipeline
becomes something secondary, in the back yard, or over the fence or
across the street.
</P>
<P>
   At Sixty-01 Village, an apartment and condominium complex along
the right-of-way, the pipeline has a putting green built over it,
and P-patches _ now fragrant with late spring blooms _ planted
around it. There's a tennis court there, too, and a volleyball
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I've got more concern with the high-power lines
overhead than I do with the gas lines,'' said Randy Kundert, who
directs maintenance at Sixty-01.
</P>
<P>
   Across Old Redmond Road, at her home on Northeast 137th Street,
Gloria Hull reads voraciously, watches the Seattle Mariners every
night and looks out her back window at the birds and squirrels.
</P>
<P>
   For 31 years, when she lived two and a half miles down Northeast
137th, she had a pipeline and power lines running through her
property.
</P>
<P>
   When they put the pipeline in there, she said, she moved her
horses out of the barn _ just in case. But that was the extent of
her worries.
</P>
<P>
   For the past six years she's lived with the pipeline just beyond
her brown wood fence, and when the trees get full, she can barely
see the triple-phase power lines that mark the pipeline's path
through east King County.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of those type people who won't worry about something
they have no control over. And I don't have any control over
that,'' she says nodding toward the pipeline's vicinity. ``So why
worry about it?''
</P>
<P>
   There is some concern, of course. Lou Kelly, a maintenance
worker at Sixty-01, has been regarding the grounds differently
since the Bellingham blast. Especially since his job takes him into
the soil near the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the pipe (in Bellingham) was buried 15 feet deep, and
last week we were out at the gate digging around 20 feet to fix the
fence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another resident of the complex, Carol, is aware of the pipeline
and doesn't like it much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really think about it,'' she said. ``I know it's
there, and I think about it when my daughter and I take walks and
cross over it. My hope is that if something goes wrong, the
fireball isn't too big.''

U.S. INDICTS 85 IN $100 MILLION STOCK-SWINDLING SCHEME
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal officials announced Wednesday the indictments
of 85 people who they said had swindled thousands of unwary
investors out of more than $100 million by manipulating the stocks
of small and start-up companies. Three of the suspects have ties to
organized crime, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The schemes generally followed the outlines of what has become a
classic approach to bilking less than vigilant investors: a group
of swindlers buys or steals the stocks of small companies and then
induces brokers, through secret payoffs, to market them
aggressively. Once the share price rises, they sell, leaving
investors with huge losses.
</P>
<P>
   Three separate schemes were involved, the longest running from
1991 to 1998, the investigators said. They added that two of the
people charged, Dominick Dionisio, 29, and Enrico Locascio, 29, are
linked to the Colombo crime family, and one, Yakov Slavin, 36, is
linked to a Russian crime group.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the involvement of these three underscored
organized crime's continuing exploitation of the lucrative bull
market on Wall Street. They said mobsters had sought new criminal
opportunities after law enforcement efforts curbed their profits
from the businesses they had traditionally infiltrated, like
garbage hauling, the garment industry and the city's wholesale food
and produce markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mob never saw a market it didn't want to control,'' said
Lewis D. Schiliro, head of the FBI's New York office. He joined
officials of the Securities and Exchange Commission and other
agencies in the Brooklyn office of Zachary W. Carter, the U.S.
attorney for the Eastern District of New York, where the
indictments were announced.
</P>
<P>
   The people named in the three indictments, which totaled more
than 100 pages, included licensed and unlicensed brokers and sales
people affiliated with what federal law enforcement and securities
officials said were nine small, corrupt brokerage firms that
manipulated the stocks of about 20 companies.
</P>
<P>
   The companies were involved with products like toys, clothing,
drugs, computer-related equipment and, in one case, a new additive
to motor oil that was aimed at improving the operation of auto
engines.
</P>
<P>
   Their stocks were called ``microcap'' stocks because the
companies had small-market capitalizations, little or no revenue, a
fairly low number of shares and a low volume of trading, which was
not carried out on a major exchange, said Jonathan S. Sack, an
assistant U.S. attorney in Brooklyn and one of the prosecutors in
the cases.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the companies traded their securities on the Nasdaq
small-capitalization stock market and its OTC Bulletin Board, an
over-the-counter trading forum for 7,000 tiny companies.

QWEST IS NEAR TO A PARTNERSHIP WITH CISCO
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even as investors continue to digest Qwest Communications
International Inc.'s unsolicited $55 billion bid to acquire U S
West Inc. and the Frontier Corp., announced earlier this week,
Qwest is pushing ahead with deploying its advanced fiber optic
communications network.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Qwest was close to a partnership worth as much as $1
billion with Cisco Systems Inc., the leading maker of data
communications gear. Under the agreement, Cisco will supply
equipment while the two companies jointly develop advanced
communications services based on Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is structured so that Qwest pays only for equipment
that is actually in use, executives close to the deal said. That
could allow Qwest to better manage its cash flow by paying only for
gear that is generating revenue rather than for truckloads of
equipment that might not be put into use for weeks or months. The
value of the deal could fluctuate depending on customers'
acceptance of the new system and services, the executives added.
</P>
<P>
   The deal ``gives us a partner that can help us on the technology
side,'' said Lewis O. Wilks, president of Qwest's Internet unit.
</P>
<P>
   As Qwest moves from standard telephone networks to systems based
on Internet technology, Wilks said, ``Cisco is helping us architect
it so that transition is seamless.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald J. Listwin, the Cisco executive vice president in charge
of selling products to big communications carriers, said, ``This is
a partnership that is going to enable Qwest to have really the
first all-Internet-based network and is of substantial importance
for us in that we are going to get the lion's share of the
infrastructure business.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco may well get most of Qwest's spending on Internet gear,
but Qwest has not said it will build an all-Internet-based network
_ something a rival long-distance carrier, Level 3 Communications
Inc., has said it plans to do. Instead, Qwest has said it will use
a range of protocols, including Internet technology but also other
systems with an older pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   Wilks said the Qwest deal would not accelerate the demise of the
other systems in Qwest's network, but added, ``It continues to
point to what we think is a technological trend.''

INFOMERCIAL FIRM'S IPO RECEIVES LUKEWARM RESPONSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- An infomercial company that added a ``.com'' to
its name in December went public Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   GenesisIntermedia.com, initially priced at $8.50 a share, closed
at $8.5625, up 6.25 cents. Formerly Genesis Media Group, the Studio
City company sold 2 million common shares to the public, according
to IPO Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The issue traded under ``GENI'' in the Nasdaq National Market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors have gone Internet mad. . . . But it doesn't mean
you have to invest in it. It's not a pure Internet company,'' said
Tom Taulli, an analyst at IPO Monitor, a listing service in
Calabasas, and author of the book ``Investing in IPOs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramy El-Batrawi, chief executive of Genesis, said the company
changed its name because it acquired two technology companies and
expects to expand its operations in the multimedia arena.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to use money from the IPO to repay debt,
reimburse shareholders who had to shoulder S corporation income
taxes, develop interactive mall kiosks, expand operations and for
general corporate purposes. Most of its revenues come from
traditional media of print ads and infomercials.
</P>
<P>
   SEC filings also show that ``Trade Your Way To Riches,'' a video
Genesis used to market, is being investigated by the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, a regulatory agency. The federal
government has subpoenaed infomercial host Jake Bernstein and MBH
Commodity Advisors. El-Batrawi owns Trade Your Way To Riches Inc.,
which produces the video.
</P>
<P>
   Genesis said it no longer markets the video.

ADVERTISING: BIG-BUDGETED CAMPAIGNS FOR AUTO RACING AND GOLF 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As summer approaches, two sports organizations are running
multimillion-dollar advertising campaigns to woo spectators,
participants and advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The Indy Racing League, an 11-race, open-wheel series owned by
Indianapolis Motor Speedway Corp., whose prime event is the
Indianapolis 500, has hired Wieden &AMP; Kennedy to create its first
national ad campaign ever. In addition, the U.S. Golf Association,
the 104-year-old golf governing body, is running two new TV ads by
BBDO New York, a unit of the Omnicom Group, during the U.S. Open,
which starts Thursday in Pinehurst, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jeff Chapman, director of marketing and branding
for the racing league, public awareness of the league, which
started in 1996, has been very low. ``The equipment, cars and teams
do great,'' he said, ``but we knew we needed to formally launch the
product from a marketing standpoint.'' Increasing attendance and TV
viewership ``could lead to increased sponsorships,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, attendance at Indy Racing events has grown 13
percent. It has 10 major sponsors, led by The Pep Boys _ Manny, Moe
and Jack, the Philadelphia-based automotive parts and services
company. According to IEG Sponsorship Report, a newsletter that
follows sports marketing, the league's sponsorships, including
sponsors for teams and tracks, totaled an estimated $101 million in
1998, and are expected to reach $105 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   Wieden &AMP; Kennedy is the Portland, Ore., agency whose work for
Nike and ESPN has won many plaudits.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has created a $10 million campaign that will run
through October; almost 70 percent of the budget is devoted to
national television and print media, while the remainder is
allocated to local print and TV.
</P>
<P>
   There are a dozen 30- and 60-second national TV spots, five of
which appeared last month before the Indianapolis 500. Four will
break next week. These commercials, with the tag line ``You had to
be there,'' are running on cable channels like Fox Sports and on
cable programs like ESPN Sportscenter and Inside NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-second commercials are irreverent and entertaining, a
tone that is typical of Wieden &AMP; Kennedy. In one, Davey Hamilton, a
driver, brags about his new helmet to another driver, Sam Schmidt,
only to discover, to his chagrin, that its design is identical to
that of Schmidt's helmet; rather like two women arriving at a
dinner party in the same dress. Another spot, accompanied by Tommy
Roe's 1969 song ``Dizzy,'' shows spectators spinning their heads
around to watch an Indy race on an oval track.
</P>
<P>
   A 60-second commercial, whose tone is entirely different from
the others, is a tribute to Jerry Unser, one of the three legendary
Unser brothers, who was killed in 1959 at the age of 26 at the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The ad shows his son Johnny, now 40
and a driver in the league, at the speedway, as well as footage
from family movies and photographs of Jerry Unser competing.
</P>
<P>
   Print advertising for the league, which is running in magazines
like Car &AMP; Driver and Motor Trend, in USA Today and local
newspapers, contains striking photographs shot by Wieden &AMP;
Kennedy's creative team at two Indy Racing events earlier this
year; one ad, for example, shows Scott Goodyear, a driver,
autographing a model car in the pit. This advertising has the same
tag line as the TV spots.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Chipps, an editor of IEG Sponsorship Report, said he
thought the league had opted to run a big-budget campaign because
``attendance has been struggling,'' and NASCAR doesn't ``have to
spend that kind of money to draw people to their events.'' CART is
the Championship Auto Racing Team and NASCAR is the National
Association for Stock-Car Auto Racing.
</P>
<P>
   He also questioned whether the advertising could lift attendance
for Indy Racing, saying, For ``true-blue motor sports fans, their
allegiances are already set.''
</P>
<P>
   The golf association is running two new spots by BBDO, seeking
to promote the association's services and increase membership,
during ESPN and NBC broadcasts of the United States Open and five
other championships through October. Air time is worth an estimated
$8 million.
</P>
<P>
   A 60-second, sentimental spot, partly shot in soft focus,
suggests the association ``handles'' golf ``with care'' and
includes an ``800'' number golfers can call for membership
information. The second, a 30-second spot that shows dawn breaking
over a course as a group of male golfers arrives to play, is
amusing: It says studies have shown man can survive for four weeks
without food, for three days without water, but for only one day
without golf. At the end, one of the golfers _ who is apparently
still half-asleep _ is told to leave because he is wearing pajamas,
an outfit the course has forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we're accused of being humorless,'' said Marty
Parkes, senior director of communications for the golf association.
``But a lot of the reason people play golf is fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the ``for the good of the game'' theme created for
the golf association by BBDO when it won the association's business
two years ago, Parkes added, ``Part of the good of the game is to
make sure people continue to have fun.''

BRAZIL AUCTIONS OIL LICENSES, ENDING SOME STATE CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SIMON ROMERO    c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ The government ended Brazil's oil monopoly
in a two-day auction that concluded Wednesday, overcoming
nationalist resistance and recently weak petroleum prices to
auction the first exploration licenses to big foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
   The AGIP unit of ENI of Italy, BP Amoco PLC, Exxon, Texaco and
Unocal were among the victors in the auction for 12 of 27 fields,
which took place in Rio de Janeiro. Companies agreed to pay $181
million to Brazil for licenses to explore for oil mainly off the
Atlantic coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the Italians, the Spanish, the Argentines, the
Americans and others that won fields,'' said Jean-Paul Prates, the
president of Expetro, a Rio de Janeiro-based consulting firm
specializing in oil and gas. ``It is a new competitive era.''
</P>
<P>
   The auction of the licenses is part of a wider easing of the
government's grip on energy. Over the last several years, foreign
companies have purchased such state assets as electric utilities
and gas companies as well as licenses to expand Brazil's natural
gas grid.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it has been in the oil industry, a redoubt of nationalists
and labor interests, where the government has found the strongest
opposition to its privatization program. To proceed with this
week's auction, officials had to overcome last-minute legal
challenges from left-wing opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone on its home turf, Petroleo Brasileiro SA, or
 &UR; Petrobras &LR; , the state-controlled company created in the 1950s amid
cries of ``the oil is ours,'' bid aggressively and won some of the
choicest licenses. It thus put on a show of the government's
continued strength in a new competitive environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The valuation of the Brazilian oil business has risen to a new
level, and we're well positioned to compete,'' Petrobras president
Henri Philippe Reichstul told reporters in Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
   Although Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has
discarded the idea of ceding state control of Petrobras in the
foreseeable future, the results of the auction are expected to bode
well for the next big development in Brazil's oil industry, the
sale of a large minority stake in the company. The transaction has
been delayed since turbulence hit Brazilian financial markets late
in 1998 and early this year.
</P>
<P>
   While Petrobras and other companies, most notably AGIP,
submitted pricey bids for some areas, other oilfields were ignored,
suggesting Brazil's the perceived low potential as a producer
compared with Latin American countries like Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has about 9 billion barrels of proven reserves, compared
with roughly 64 billion barrels in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Petrobras has made strides to lessen Brazil's
dependence on foreign oil through the development of advanced
offshore drilling methods. Brazil produces about 1.2 million
barrels of oil a day, equivalent to two-thirds of its daily
domestic consumption. In the next three years, domestic production
is seen growing to 1.5 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   Production from the fields auctioned this week should start
within six or seven years. The government is hoping for investments
of $15 billion and the creation of up to 300,000 jobs, according to
David Zylbersztajn, the head of Brazil's energy regulatory agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the breakup of the monopoly accomplished, we can move
forward,'' Zylbersztajn said.
</P>
<P>
   Before investments proceed much further, however, tax and
regulatory details must be worked out, oil industry analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil is still seen as messy for many oil companies,'' said
Declan Ryan, head of Latin American energy research at Wood
Mackenzie Consultants in Edinburgh, Scotland.

MINIMED GETS OK FOR BLOOD SUGAR SYSTEM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Diabetic-treatment specialist MiniMed Inc.
reached a key milestone Wednesday as the federal government issued
final approval of its potentially blockbuster system for monitoring
blood sugar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Continuous tissue glucose monitoring is breakthrough
technology that ultimately could revolutionize the care of
diabetics,'' said Jane E. Henney, Food and Drug Administration
commissioner. ``This new system is a first step in that
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street cheered the FDA move, boosting MiniMed stock 3
percent, or $2.3125, to a record of $75.0625. The issue has more
than tripled in less than a year, mostly on optimism over the
continuous glucose monitoring system.
</P>
<P>
   Industry trackers believe the system -- which can help doctors
make a precise determination of when patients should take insulin
and how much to inject -- eventually could become a powerful
addition to MiniMed revenues, on track to hit $200 million this
year. By closely regulating glucose, diabetics are less likely to
suffer from complications such as blindness and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Archie Smith, an analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, said
the device could boost revenues by $10 million in the first year.
``It's the first step in what will be a significant product line,
but it will be at least 24 to 36 months before it makes a major
contribution,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   About 16 million people in the United States have diabetes.
MiniMed executives have indicated they plan to develop more complex
devices that would constantly monitor blood sugar. ``There's been a
tremendous anticipation for this type of product,'' said Senior
Vice President Eric Kentor.
</P>
<P>
   Sylmar-based MiniMed will formally introduce the system for
commercial use at this weekend's meeting of the American Diabetes
Association in San Diego and could start selling devices to doctors
by next month. Initial rollout during the third quarter will be
gradual, with the first systems available through a physician's
prescription at a few selected diabetic treatment centers.
</P>
<P>
   The device -- a tiny electrode fitted under the abdomen's skin
and connected to a monitor attached to a belt or waistband -- gives
a precise reading of glucose levels every five minutes. The
information can be gathered for up to 72 hours and downloaded on a
computer, leading to customized treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetics now monitor glucose by testing blood samples from
finger pricks several times a day. The FDA warned Wednesday that
MiniMed's system won't replace that painful procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Kentor said pricing has not been set but added that MiniMed's
goal will be to make it competitive with conventional blood-testing
systems. He also said MiniMed will boost its work force of 1,100 as
production of the device increases.

FOR RAMBIS, JUST ANOTHER TOUGH SPOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ For a guy who presided over one of the
NBA's premier teams for three months, Kurt Rambis has had a
decidedly unkind year.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected promotion to head coach in February was quickly
followed by a major trade, too many Dennis Rodman flare-ups to
count, locker-room feuds and an unhappy Glen Rice _ all in a
truncated season allowing no time to pull together a young,
disjointed team.
</P>
<P>
   And when it was all over, Rambis took more than his share of
blame for the Lakers' collapse against the San Antonio Spurs in the
playoffs. And now, limbo.
</P>
<P>
   When the Lakers decided to pursue Phil Jackson, Rambis fell from
front-runner candidate to the edge of unemployment. Now he can only
wait as Jackson decides whether to retain Rambis as an assistant,
the role he filled for four-plus seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to get the opportunity to talk to Phil about the
possibility of joining his coaching staff. That has not been done
yet,'' Rambis said from his Manhattan Beach home.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson deferred answers about his staff Wednesday, but it seems
certain he will hire Tex Winter, architect of the triangle offense
and his longtime assistant in Chicago. Other strong candidates
include Bulls assistant Jimmy Rodgers and former Dallas Mavericks
head coach Jim Cleamons.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Drew, a Lakers assistant for seven years, also wants to
stay, while longtime assistant Bill Bertka might accept a
front-office position with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson will meet today with Lakers executive Jerry West and
general manager Mitch Kupchak to discuss several matters, including
the coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Drew attended Jackson's noon press conference at the Beverly
Hilton and said there is ``no doubt'' he wants to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already expressed to Jerry (West) that I would be very
interested in remaining here as an assistant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis, who passed up potential opportunities to coach the
Sacramento Kings and the Clippers, has no regrets, despite his
current awkward position. He's been guaranteed a job within the
organization and will have offers elsewhere, but his clear
preference is to coach under Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I was disappointed'' not to be rehired, he said, but
the 41-year-old Rambis philosophically calls this season, his first
as a head coach, a learning experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether I'm an assistant coach or head coach, I don't think
that learning process ever stops,'' he said, ``and to have the
possible opportunity to work with Phil is, I think, a golden
opportunity to learn from one of the best coaches that's ever been
involved in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's contract is for five years. If Rambis, with his deep
Lakers ties and high upside as a coach, sticks around long enough,
he might yet get his dream job. But his mind is on the present.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be very presumptuous to say it's my goal to
stay with this organization the rest of my life,'' he said. ``I
think every opportunity that is presented to me, I will weigh it
against what I have.''

TOUR DE FRANCE ORGANIZERS PULL WHEELS OUT FROM UNDER DRUG
OFFENDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Responding to the drug scandals that have tarnished
bicycle racing for nearly a year, the organizers of the Tour de
France announced Wednesday that they had banned four French riders,
an entire Dutch team and the director and doctor of a Spanish team.
</P>
<P>
   The action was unprecedented in the recent history of the Tour,
which began in 1903 and runs for three weeks in July. The race was
crippled last year, and almost ended prematurely, when riders
reacted to police drug raids by staging two strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the right, indeed the duty, to protect the race,''
said the race director Jean-Marie Leblanc as he formally announced
the names of the 20 teams of nine riders each that were invited to
the race _ and those who were banned. None of those barred has been
found guilty or confessed to any crime, but Leblanc dismissed a
question about the legality of the action. ``Organizers can invite
whom they please.''
</P>
<P>
   The major name on the banned list was Richard Virenque, a French
idol who has finished as high as second in the Tour and four times
has been its mountain-climbing champion. Virenque, 29, was the
leader of the Festina team that was expelled from the race last
July 18 after team officials admitted that the riders had
participated in systematic doping.
</P>
<P>
   Virenque has denied knowingly using any of the illegal
performance-enhancing drugs that six of his teammates have admitted
they took. He is under formal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Festina affair has become doping affairs _ in the
plural,'' Leblanc said, citing ``the major shock waves and traumas
of doping'' that continue to echo in the sport. On June 5, Marco
Pantani, the Italian winner of the last Tour, was forbidden to ride
the final two stages of the Tour of Italy, which he was leading,
after he failed a blood test.
</P>
<P>
   Leblanc said Wednesday that Virenque's ``presence would be
incompatible with the image of the Tour, and the one we want to
preserve.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard Virenque epitomizes, in his name, in his image, the
doping phenomenon,'' Leblanc said, ``whether or not he is
responsible for the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Tour organizers also barred Laurent Roux of the Casino team and
Philippe Gaumont of Cofidis, both under suspension from their teams
in drug cases. Also, they announced, Pascal Herve, a Festina rider
who was not on the initial team list of Tour riders, would not be
welcome. Herve, like Virenque, has never admitted using drugs.
</P>
<P>
   All other riders on those teams are acceptable, organizers said.
They skirted a decision on Pantani, noting that he has said he does
not want to ride in the Tour because the course displeases him. His
Mercatone Uno team was invited, and Leblanc said, ``If Pantani
changes his mind, we will have to review the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Leblanc said that the Festina team was invited. None of the six
riders who admitted to doping and served suspensions before joining
new teams was banned.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating the ban on Virenque, Polti announced last month
that it would fight legally and possibly withdraw its team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot say yes to a team and no to one of its riders,''
the team sponsor, Franco Polti, said. ``Excluding Richard Virenque
does not solve the problem of doping.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish team ONCE may also withdraw because its director,
Manolo Saiz, and its doctor, Nicolas Terrados, were banned.
Terrados is under investigation in a Tour drug case, and Saiz was
critical of the race's organizers when he pulled his team out last
year to protest continuing police investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The TVM team from the Netherlands was banned, Leblanc said,
because of what he called improper behavior last summer. Under
investigation in another drug case in France, TVM riders were
questioned by the police after a stage and then kept late at a
hospital to give urine, blood and hair samples for drug inspection.
The team's doctor and director were also arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their attitude was an insult,'' Leblanc said, citing the ``V''
for victory sign the riders made as the race crossed the border
from France into Switzerland and the team's withdrawal once on
Swiss soil.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Claude Killy, president of company that owns the Tour de
France, opened Wednesday's news conference by saying that there was
no question the Tour would be held this year. He pointed out that
only World Wars I and II had stopped the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why penalize millions of spectators and 160 million TV viewers
around the world and, indeed, the Tour itself?'' he said. ``The
Tour de France is part of ourselves, part of our identity.'' &QL;

 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
PINEHURST, N.C. _ Jack Nicklaus always used to enjoy coming to the
U.S. Open, not so much for the golf as much as for the whining.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I used to love listening to them gripe,'' Nicklaus said of the
players who routinely bashed the Open courses. ``Somebody would
say, `The rough is too high.' You could check him off. `The greens
are too fast.' Check him off. `The course is too long.' Check him
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could just check guys off as they complain because they
complained themselves right out of the championship.''
</P>
<P>
   This year at Pinehurst No. 2, there's not much checking off
being done.
</P>
<P>
   The 99th U.S. Open, which starts this morning, is going to be
the first one in a long time in which the course equalizes the
field rather than separating it into haves and have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got that many fellows who are happy with the golf
course, there must be something wrong,'' Nicklaus said.
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong is that this truly should be a wide Open.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is complaining about conditions or the setup of
Pinehurst's fabled Donald Ross layout. The rough isn't as long as
it was last year at The Olympic Club. The greens have been softened
by on-and-off showers during the past few days, and even the nasty
greens shaped like upside-down saucers that feed shots into closely
mowed collection areas aren't drawing any rants.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody, it seems, feels like there are parts of Pinehurst
that fit their game well. And that makes the list of contenders
long.
</P>
<P>
   However, even if there are 50 or more players who genuinely have
a shot at winning this week, they first will have to beat two
people _ Tiger Woods and David Duval.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you beat Tiger, you're going to have a good chance
to win,'' said Colin Montgomerie.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie meant that Woods may not be accepting the trophy
Sunday afternoon, but there's a good chance he's going to be in the
hunt to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Even Duval believes it's going to be a lot more than a
one-on-one Open. If this ends up as the coming-out party of a
Duval-Woods rivalry, it will be surprising to one of the
participants in that anticipated duel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the way the setup is will bring a lot more people into
the mix,'' Duval said. ``When you play a typical Open, you know the
fairway is going to be narrow and the rough is going to be high.
But here, you have options of advancing the ball from the rough.
And that brings more people into play. I think it's a lot more
wide-open.
</P>
<P>
   ``But one thing about the Open: This is my seventh or eighth
Open, and I've yet to play in one that hitting it in the fairway
and knocking it on the green doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   And Duval expects to have a good chance of doing just that this
week despite some leftover blisters on his right thumb and index
finger where he received burns last week when picking up an
overheated teapot.
</P>
<P>
   Duval said he has overcome that and a midseason lull that he
said hit him after the Masters and caused him to play poorly at the
Shell Houston Open and miss the cut the following week in New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put a lot of hard work in on and off the golf course getting
ready for the run from The Players Championship to Augusta,'' Duval
said. ``As a result, I just wasn't as ready to play as I would like
to be when I got to Houston. Maybe it's just that I was more
drained from those three weeks than I had expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I chose not to play for a while, to try to get back and get
ready. And yes, I'm very eager to play now.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval still owns the No. 1 world ranking over Woods, but just
barely. And a Woods win this week would send him back into the top
spot he surrendered to Duval in March.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of the teapot injury wasn't lost on Duval. ``I've gone
snowboarding a lot,'' he said, ``and people think that I'm crazy to
do that. But then I almost take myself out trying to fix a cup of
coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Woods, he is the pre-tournament favorite by virtue of
having won the last two times he has played, once in Europe and two
weeks ago at the Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   And Woods should benefit from the fact that the rough is two
inches shorter than it was last year at The Olympic Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like this course a lot,'' Woods said. ``The course is
playing a little more friendly than I thought it would. I think the
USGA recognized the fact that they made a mistake last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``From tee to green, this is a very simple course. It's around
the green where it gets very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   But even around the green this week, players can make shots.
They may be difficult shots. But they can be made, unlike some of
the thatch-roof lies that confronted them last year when Lee
Janzen's winning score was even-par.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot more players could win this golf tournament than we've
seen in past U.S. Opens,'' said Greg Norman. ``I think that's a
credit to the USGA for setting up the course the way they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that players should get comfortable with the surroundings
this week. Even if the rain keeps the track soft all week and
scores dip, the USGA has no intentions of letting the Open become a
shootout every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The golf-course architecture lends itself to this setup,
whereas others do not,'' said Trey Holland, chairman of the USGA's
Championship Committee. ``We'll find ourselves going back to
(other) styles when we go to golf courses that lend themselves to
that style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus will continue to be trying to put the supreme test,
if you will, for the United States Open championship, and that
objective will not change.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's very safe to say that the rough here is a little bit
more along the lines of what the players are used to. We feel the
rough is much more fair and it's going to allow players to do
things with the golf ball that they haven't been able to do at
prior U.S. Opens.''
</P>
<P>
   As Davis Love III said: ``When you have a great golf course that
can't be set up with deep rough around the greens, you know you're
going to get a fair test of golf. This is a special Open and a
special place.''
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of the week, the scores might suggest that this
week did not give, as the USGA likes to say, the supreme test of
golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming in, I feel the players are going to score fairly high
or fairly low,'' Nicklaus said. ``I don't think it will be in the
middle ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like the Open record will be broken or you'll have a
hard time breaking par, depending on the conditions. If the rain
continues and the greens are soft and these guys can throw the ball
at the pin, then they are long enough and strong enough to (shoot
low).
</P>
<P>
   ``If the golf course stayed fairly dry, and we have any wind at
all, I think they'll have an awfully hard time staying around
par.''
</P>
<P>
   But the tournament will start with the soft conditions, meaning
this will begin as the warm-and-fuzzy U.S. Open.

AS SESSION ENDS, LITTLE TO SHOW, AND STILL NO STATE BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The Legislature's 1999 session reached its
scheduled end Wednesday with all the usual frenzy but none of the
results, as lawmakers failed to make deals on most unresolved
issues, and girded for a showdown over whether the state would keep
paying hospital bills after Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republican senators and Senate aides said that on
Thursday, Republican Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, will, for the
first time, allow his chamber to vote on a bill making it illegal
for protesters to block access to an abortion clinic. The bill,
which is almost assured of passage, would not go as far as the one
passed by the Democrat-controlled Assembly, and it would include
tougher criminal penalties for stalkers, which some Democrats
dislike. But aides to Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said it would
be seriously considered.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the proposal stalls in the Senate, it represents an
important turn by Bruno, who has refused to permit a clinic access
bill to reach the Senate floor. ``I do sense a change in climate,''
said Sen. Roy Goodman, R-Manhattan, who favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The state has no budget, 2{ months into the fiscal year, and its
hospital financing system expires later this year, so everyone
knows the Legislature will return to Albany several more times this
year. On Wednesday, the leaders of the Senate and Assembly said
they would be in session again Thursday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the scene in the Capitol reflected end-of-session
tradition, as lawmakers tried to make a flurry of deals and to rid
themselves of their ordinary business, while lobbyists and interest
groups crowded Capitol hallways, trying to buttonhole legislators
and raise their voices above the din. Orthodox Jews pressed for a
law requiring health insurance plans to cover infertility
treatment, as environmentalists tried to block a bill permitting
cellular phone towers with no environmental review.
</P>
<P>
   But at day's end, the Legislature had little more to show for
its efforts than a handful of routine bills passed by both houses,
and controversial ones that passed in one house but were dead on
arrival in the other.
</P>
<P>
   In another end-of-session tradition, top lawmakers made a raft
of new proposals. Pataki called for campaign finance reform and a
renewal of the state's Superfund program for toxic waste cleanup,
while Silver proposed a $294 million effort to build or buy housing
for 3,500 mentally ill people.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for the first time, legislators' paychecks are being
withheld as long as the budget is late, and the day brought them
unwelcome news. In May, in a suit filed by 14 Democratic
legislators, a Brooklyn judge struck down the law, but Gov. George
Pataki and Attorney General Eliot Spitzer appealed to the Court of
Appeals, New York's highest court. Wednesday, the court turned down
the plaintiffs' request that they be paid pending the outcome of
the appeal and set oral arguments for Aug. 24, meaning that it
probably would not rule until October.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, a Republican, held another in a series of budget talks
Wednesday with Silver, but they said they were no closer to an
accord. ``At this point, I think we're still in the exploratory
stages of setting up parameters for going to conference
committees,'' Silver said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time this year, lawmakers face a significant
deadline in the budget battle. Cuts to Medicaid that were made in
1995 and 1996 are set to expire June 30, and if they do, state and
local governments will find themselves paying more to hospitals and
nursing homes, at a rate of almost $1 billion a year. The governor
is determined to continue the cuts, but the Democrats want to
restore some of them.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers have kept the government running through a series of
emergency spending bills, and Thursday, Pataki will send another
one or two such bills to the Legislature, to cover operations
through July 11. That means that for the first time, the governor
will be trying to extend 1995 and 1996 cuts past their expiration
date, which he says is essential. Silver has said that he will not
allow that, but he refused to comment on the subject Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the governor said it is still unclear whether he will
send one emergency bill for the entire state government, or two,
one for Medicaid and one for everything else. If he sends a single
bill, brinkmanship over the cuts would threaten to shut down state
government Monday.
</P>
<P>
   And if, as most officials here believe, he sends two bills, the
stalemate would threaten to cut off all state Medicaid payments to
hospitals, nursing homes and home health care providers Monday.
Some of those hospitals say that without Medicaid reimbursement,
they would be unable to meet their bills within a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters, the state is required to send the Federal
government, by June 30, its plan for Medicaid spending for the next
year. State and federal officials say they do not know what will
happen if the state simply ignores the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   June 30 represents still more deadlines, including expiration of
the law controlling rents for thousands of people who live in
converted lofts, mostly in Manhattan, one of the issues still in
negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few deals of note to be struck in the closing frenzy
would give parole officers the presumption that any heart disease
they suffer is job-related, allowing them to retire early with
greatly enhanced pensions. The Assembly was expected to pass it
Thursday, but it was not clear whether Pataki would sign it.
</P>
<P>
   Such laws are controversial, because the workers involved are
not required to show any connection between their ailments and
their jobs, and because they increase government costs.
</P>
<P>
   Similar laws have been enacted for New York City police and
firefighters and city and state correction officers.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, Silver and Bruno are close to an agreement on a law
making it easier to compel mentally ill people to undergo
treatment, and in some instances to commit them against their will.

QUESTIONS TO PONDER ON VACATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't know about your workplace, but at mine the
most-often-uttered sentence of the month has been, ``I need a
vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the time of year when long lunch hours or early Friday
escapes aren't big enough battery rechargers to count. It's time
for longer getaways from the grind. It's also time to ponder:
</P>
<P>
   Can a nation awash in annual productivity gains continue to
expect improvement from workers who have comparatively little
vacation reward and relaxation time?
</P>
<P>
   Or does America derive its productivity strength precisely from
the fact that U.S. workers don't get as much vacation time as
workers in other developed nations?
</P>
<P>
   Among world commerce leaders, the United States stands markedly
apart in that it has no statutory vacation requirements. Without a
government mandate, most American workers work longer than their
global counterparts to earn their paid vacation time, according to
a survey by Hewitt Associates.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest differences is that most U.S. employers base
vacation time on job tenure. A typical American worker needs to
work five years in the same place before getting three paid weeks
off _ a vacation duration that is the norm for European workers
after only one year of service.
</P>
<P>
   (A separate survey by Management Recruiters International found
that 82 percent of 5,000 managers surveyed said they took work
along on their vacations, so ``vacation time'' may be a misnomer
anyway. But that's another topic.)
</P>
<P>
   The Hewitt survey looked at vacation policies around the world
and found that the Danish government mandated 33 vacation days a
year, making it the world leader in required paid time off. (But
Denmark's standard workweek is six days, not five, so its vacation
mandate isn't all that huge in terms of hours worked.)
</P>
<P>
   Government-mandated vacation among America's international
business competitors ranges from Mexico's six days to Denmark's 33
days (for workers with one year of service), according to the
Hewitt survey.
</P>
<P>
   Other nations with six-day workweeks include Austria, with 30
mandated vacation days, and France and Norway, with 25 required
days. Sweden has a five-day workweek, but also decrees 25 days.
</P>
<P>
   Belgium, Finland, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain and
Switzerland order between 20 and 24 vacation days for their
five-day workweeks. Australia requires 20. Fifteen days are
mandated in New Zealand and the United Kingdom, but the U.K.
requirement rises to 20 in November.
</P>
<P>
   Japan and Canada provide 10 vacation days after one year on the
job, which coincides with typical U.S. business practices. Hewitt's
survey found that 81 percent of U.S. employers provided two weeks
of vacation after one year of service.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that 80 percent of U.S. employers offered
three weeks of paid time off after five years of service and that
87 percent allowed four weeks off after 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   But remember the big difference from world competitors: U.S.
vacation time usually is earned based on tenure beyond one year. So
when someone says, ``Enjoy your time off; you've earned it,'' you
really have.

MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) _ He's a small slender man with a long
narrow face, a long thin nose and a bald spot on the back of his
head that'll get bigger and bigger as he ages. But for now he looks
young and, when wearing his large oval spectacles, innocent. If you
saw him outside the courtroom, Scott Falater would remind you of
Don Knotts, not a guy who stabbed his wife 44 times and dumping her
body. Then claimed he was sleepwalking. By E.J. MONTINI Story will

</P>
<P>
   OKCORRAL (Phoenix) _ To begin with, ``OK Corral'' has a nice,
snappy, Western sound, perfect for the site of a shoot-'em-up. If
the event had taken place at, say, Fred's Corral or the OK
Bathhouse, the Old West's most famous gunfight might not have
become so famous. And thanks to the fuzziness of contemporary
accounts _ plus all the subsequent yarn spinning and moviemaking
and book writing _ the history of that bloody day is still not
particularly certain and the story is all the more enduring. By

   QUAYLE (Concord, N.H.) _ GOP presidential hopeful Dan Quayle
ripped what he views as the ``mushy'' message of GOP front-runner
George W. Bush Wednesday, saying that it could lead, at best, to a
hollow victory for Republicans. An intense Quayle compared the
Texas governor's unwillingness to take a stand on many issues to
President Bill Clinton's ``triangulation'' strategy designed to
seek the middle ground between the extreme factions of his party.
It was developed by Clinton's former advisor, Dick Morris, who was
fired for dallying with a prostitute. ``Republicans don't win
elections trying to be like Bill Clinton and being Dick Morris
Republicans,'' Quayle said in an interview. ``If you are going to
run an ambiguous, mushy, equivocating, triangulation, Dick Morris
type of campaign, what good is it to be elected? You're not really
going to change the country. And I want to change the country.'' By
KRIS MAYES and CHARLES KELLY. Story will move in the ``A''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SLEEPWALK (Phoenix) _ Scott Falater, taking the stand in his
defense Wednesday, testified amid tears that he did not
deliberately stab his wife 44 times and that she was the love of
his life. ``Some people talk about their spouse as their right
arm,'' said the man who claims he was sleepwalking when he stabbed
his wife 44 times. ``She was like both my arms, and my legs, half
my head and all of my heart. By JERRY KAMMER. Story will movein the

EDITORIAL: AL GORE AS THE UN-CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, June 17:
</P>
<P>
   All vice presidents have a special challenge when they try to
run for president themselves. They have to campaign on the
achievements of the outgoing administration while also separating
themselves from its failings. In one sense Al Gore's job should be
a straightforward one. Practically everyone on the planet can
identify the big defect in the Clinton presidency, and Gore has
gotten off to a brisk start in explaining how he would differ from
Bill Clinton. In carefully calculated television interviews, Gore
shed his role as the president's defender against what he once
described as partisan attacks stemming from the sexual scandals of
the Clinton White House. He now sees the Monica Lewinsky episode as
``inexcusable'' and tells reporters that he resented the ``wasted
time'' the president's conduct caused.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, when he officially announced his candidacy in
Tennessee, the vice president pulled out all the stops in billing
himself as the family-values candidate. A prominent part in the
proceedings was given to his eldest daughter, who is expecting a
baby any day now. He asked the electorate to let him bring ``my own
values'' to the White House, implicity suggesting that those values
are different from the ones currently on display. Gore's delivery
also indicates that he is trying to respond to criticism of his
wooden speaking style by injecting some passion into his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's vice-presidential baggage does not include the task of
explaining exactly what he has been doing for the last seven years.
It is a tribute both to him and the president that Gore has been a
key policy player in this administration, and one of Clinton's most
influential advisers. He is particularly expert on foreign
relations and the environment, areas where the leading Republican
candidate, George W. Bush, is weak.
</P>
<P>
   But if the current polls are any indication, Gore is going to
have to do more than offer the American people eight more years of
the same policies, plus marital fidelity. He needs his own vision
of what comes next. His speech on Wednesday suggested that his
answer is remarkably similar to the one propounded earlier this
week by Bush. Both men are talking about moving beyond material
prosperity to build, in Gore's words, ``an America that is not only
better off but better,'' with strong families and caring
communities. They both stress education, and making sure that, as
the nation grows wealthier, no segment of society is left behind.
</P>
<P>
   From this early vantage point, it appears that the main danger
in this campaign could be the spectacle of two candidates clinging
so firmly to the center, appealing so consistently to the soccer
moms and the suburban vote that their themes become interchangeable
in the public mind. If that happens, the election could very likely
turn on issues of personality, and it would be unfortunate if the
public reacted to its disappointment with Clinton by deciding this
election on the basis of personal charm.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of Americans who talk to pollsters may say right
now that they prefer Bush to Gore, but they are also wise enough to
admit by huge margins that they do not know enough about either
man. Both have a long way to go before even winning a nomination.
They also have plenty of work to do turning the warm and fuzzy
campaign themes unveiled this week into proposals of clarity and
substance.

CULTURE WAR RAGES IN HOUSE AS PRESIDENT SCRAMBLES FOR VOTES ON GUN
CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS to UPDATE with House passing minimum prison sentences
for juvenile crime, trims and clarifies throughout.) 
 (With CONGRESS-GUNS-SCENE) 
(rm) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL and FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bitterly divided House plunged Wednesday into the
nation's culture wars, passionately debating long into the night
whether school prayer, a clampdown on violence in entertainment,
stiff prison sentences or gun control was the answer to the spate
of school shootings that have left teen-agers dead.
</P>
<P>
   The debate was the beginning of a two- to three-day free-for-all
as the House considered 44 amendments on cultural issues and crime
and 11 gun-control proposals. The House approved tough mandatory
minimum sentences to combat juvenile crime. But in a blow to social
conservatives, the House on Wednesday night voted 282-146 to reject
a measure sponsored by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill, that would have made
it a crime to expose children to movies, books or video games
containing explicit sex or violence.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans _ including three members of Judiciary
Committee, which Hyde chairs _ strode to the Democratic side of the
chamber to agree with Democrats that Hyde's legislation was an
unconstituional abridgement of the First Amendment right of free
speech. Ninety-two Republicans joined 189 Democrats and one
independent to defeat the measure, while 127 Republicans and 19
Democrats voted for it.
</P>
<P>
   But if they suffered a loss, the conservatives had their day on
the stage as the House Republican leaders made sure the cultural
debate came ahead of the gun control debate preferred by Democrats.
The scheduling gave Republican after Republican a prime-time
platform for arguing that it was not guns, but a depraved culture
and a glorification of violence that had led to the nation's school
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the House minority whip, delivered
several thundering jeremiads on the House floor, brushing aside the
gun debate to blame American culture as the source of youth
violence. He pointedly read aloud a letter, sent to a local Texas
newspaper, that condemned everything from birth control to day care
to the absence of prayer in school.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating the words of the letter-writer, DeLay bitingly asked
why school shootings happened and suggested that everything from
daycare to television to birth control was to blame. ``It couldn't
have been,'' he said, reading from the letter, ``because our
children, who historically have been seen as a blessing from God,
are now being viewed as either a mistake created when
contraceptions fails or inconveniences that parents try to raise in
their spare time.''
</P>
<P>
   As the debate raged on the House floor, a fierce struggle for
votes was waged behind the scenes over gun control.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, flying to Geneva in advance of a meeting in
Germany with leaders of industrialized nations, telephoned two
wavering Democrats _ Nick Lampson of Texas and Bob Etheridge of
North Carolina _ to urge them to support a measure sponsored by
Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., that would regulate sales at gun
shows nearly as stringently as the Senate voted to do last month.
The Senate narrowly approved a measure that broadly defined gun
shows and gave vendors up to three business days to conduct
mandatory background checks on buyers. Mrs. McCarthy's amendment
had identical provisions but eliminates some of the paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   The president also sent a letter to moderate Republicans who had
voted for background checks for handguns six years ago, imploring
them to put ``the interests of the American people over the clout
of the gun lobby.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the issue, a dozen National Rifle
Association lobbyists worked Capitol Hill. And DeLay similarly
sought to rally some of the most conservative members of his party
around a weaker gun show measure that has been proposed by a
Democrat, Rep. John Dingell of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay told them that if they tried to vote against all gun
control, they might inadvertently help the Democrats. ``You hate to
vote for any gun control if you're a defender of the Second
Amendment,'' he said. ``At the same time, what do you do to stop
the gun control people?''
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the emotions of the day, Mrs. McCarthy choked back
tears at one news conference where she and another lawmaker were
displaying weapons that could be purchased at gun shows. She said
one of them reminded her of the gun that had killed her husband on
the Long Island railroad shooting of 1993. ``This is personal to
me,'' she had said earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House minority leader, told reporters
Wednesday night that he expected to lose about 45 Democrats when
the McCarthy measure comes to the floor. He said that would mean
gun control advocates would need to pick up 51 Republican votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a chance to do that,'' he said. But he
complained that moderate Republicans did not seem to be lobbying
their colleagues aggressively. In a backhanded compliment to the
National Rifle Association and DeLay, Gephardt said, ``We're up
against the best lobby in town and we're up against Tom DeLay's
whip organization.'' His comments minimized the role of Dingell, a
fellow Democrat fighting at DeLay's side.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., who is co-sponsoring Mrs. McCarthy's
measure, said she could not say how many Republicans would vote
with her. ``I have not been going around counting noses,'' she
said. In another effort to draw Republicans, Democrats recruited
Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., to join them in sponsoring one
comprehensive gun control measure.
</P>
<P>
   Wavering Republicans were under all kinds of pressure. Michael
Long, the chairman of the New York State Conservative Party, sent a
letter to New York Republicans calling Dingell's amendment
essential. That posed a political bind for Rep. Rick Lazio who may
challenge Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for the Republican Senate
nomination next year.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has not returned calls from reporters in recent days and
an aide said she did not know how he would vote on gun measures.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Dennis Hastert has cast the gun control vote as a matter
of conscience. But Delay, his third in command, has been working to
pass the Dingell measure. DeLay said today he is not cajoling
Republicans to vote Dingell's way but only telling them that he
planned to vote with Dingell in order to keep gun control advocates
from prevailing.
</P>
<P>
   He delivered that message to some 24 to 30 of the most
conservative members of the House over Chinese food in his office
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Dingell's gun show amendment is the least stringent version that
will come before the House. Republicans fear it could yet be
defeated if more than a dozen conservatives decide that they cannot
abide any kind of gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, DeLay, the hard-driving majority whip, was
everywhere. He made a star turn at a rally, for ``God not guns,''
on the Capitol grounds with black and Hispanic ministers from New
York, whose followers waved their Bibles in the air to punctuate
the speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``What message is sent when it is illegal to pray in schools?''
the Texan asked. ``This rejection of God must change.'' He said
that in the battle against a decadent culture ``we all need to
understand that you cannot stand up for America _ you need to kneel
down for America and stand up for God.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite the day's heated arguments over amendments, the basic
bill the House was debating is a bipartisan juvenile crime
initiative that allocates $1.5 billion in block grants to state and
local governments for aggressive prosecution, punishment and
prevention of juvenile crime.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the measures yielded passed by simple voice votes. They
included block grants to help local governments computerize their
juvenile records and mandatory life imprisonment for people
convicted of a second sexual offense against a child.
</P>
<P>
   A proposal by Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., that included stiff
mandatory minimum sentences for crimes involving guns and children,
was opposed by many liberal Democrats but passed by a vote of
249-181. It also gives federal prosecutors authority to try youths
as adults starting at age 13.
</P>
<P>
   Other amendments provoked fierce disagreement, such as Hyde's
proposal to bar youths from being sold or shown violent
entertainment, books or video games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entertainment industry gets away, literally, with
murder,'' Hyde said. ``Anybody that doesn't think rotten movies,
rotten rap lyrics, rotten video games aren't poisoning _ toxically
poisoning _ our kids' minds and making some kids think that's
acceptable, just isn't paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally impassioned, Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., countered that
Hyde's legislation ``grows the government ever larger'' and would
require a police force to determine ``what is decent.'' Asking what
movies would be banned from teenagers under the bill, he asked,
``Is that a movie like `Home Alone,' is that a movie like `Ben Hur'
is that a movie like `Private Ryan?' ''

family members, reporters and courthouse gawkers as word spread
that Falater was about to testify in his own defense, to say with
his boyishly straight face that he was sleepwalking when he carved
up his wife, Yarmila, and tried to hide the bloody evidence. &QL; 
Looks are everything &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Falater must know that nothing he says could excuse such horror.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers know.
</P>
<P>
   They know that neither sleepwalking experts nor their client's
testimony will convince jurors to set him free.
</P>
<P>
   His appearance, however, just might.
</P>
<P>
   No one, not even the defense's experts, can say they're 100
percent sure Falater was sleepwalking on the night of his wife's
death. But everyone, from the judge to the guy who sweeps out the
courtroom, is 100 percent sure he killed her.
</P>
<P>
   And yet there he sat, calm, unflinching, even as the temperature
rose in the courtroom. He didn't remove his jacket. He didn't
sweat.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear this is the best and boldest method for trying get
away with murder. Admit to the killing and ask jurors to set you
free anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Without ever speaking, everything about Falater says, ``Look at
me, I'm a twirp, a mama's boy. I could never do such a thing if I
was awake. I ``must'' have been sleepwalking.''
</P>
<P>
   His story is that he was asleep and went outside to fix the pool
pump in a trance-like state. The ``tool`` he brought with him was a
knife.
</P>
<P>
   (Perhaps he couldn't find the hunting rifle he normally uses for
home repair.)
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer says his wife interrupted him in his sleep and he
hacked her up, rolled her into the water, then packed the knife and
his bloody clothes into a plastic container, which he wrapped in a
plastic bag and hid in the wheel well of his Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, when he ``awoke'' and was told about what happened,
he didn't fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   He was calm, like Wednesday. &QL; 
No explanation, no excuse &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the courtroom, he smiled at relatives and made notes on a
legal pad while lawyers argued over the scientific viability of
sleep experts and no one discussed poor Yarmila.
</P>
<P>
   In this day and age, ordinary victims aren't nearly as
interesting as extraordinary defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they manage to convince a juror or two that Falater was
asleep during the murder, those people will still have to ask, `'So
what?''
</P>
<P>
   It's an explanation, not an excuse. There is no excuse.
</P>
<P>
   And if Scott Falater, who took the stand Wednesday afternoon,
was the pious, law-abiding man his lawyers claim he is, he wouldn't
be looking to weasel out of responsibility for his wife's death.
</P>
<P>
   It's a B-movie performance going at the courthouse, a show.
</P>
<P>
   I got the actor right but I picked the wrong Don Knotts picture.
This one's more like ``The Ghost and Mr. Chicken.'' &QL;

PATAKI PROPOSES EXTENDING AND EASING SUPERUND PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki on Wednesday proposed spending
nearly $4 billion over the next 20 years to extend the state's main
program for cleaning up toxic waste.
</P>
<P>
   But he also sought to ease many of the program's stringent
cleanup standards, as a way to spur businesses into developing
thousands of abandoned industrial sites.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, a Republican who has worked to mold a prominent
pro-environment image, has been under intense pressure to renew the
program, known as Superfund, because it is running out of money.
</P>
<P>
   But he has been slow to do so, largely because the issue placed
him in a political bind. He was caught between environmentalists
who wanted the program refinanced and even strengthened, and his
corporate allies who wanted him to relax the burdensome and costly
cleanup requirements imposed on businesses and owners of polluted
properties.
</P>
<P>
   The plan released Wednesday, essentially an opening bid in
negotiations between the two competing camps, calls for some of the
most sweeping changes to the program since its inception nearly two
decades ago in the wake of Love Canal. Both sides said that
Pataki's bill fell short of meeting all their goals, but that they
welcomed his overture as an opportunity to advance an issue of
major importance.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I think it is an effort to address widely different viewpoints
on key issues like cleanup standards and funding,'' said Kenneth
Pokalsky, an official with the Business Council of New York State,
a statewide chamber of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Izeman, a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, also gave the plan mixed reviews. ``The governor deserves
credit for advancing a proposal for refinancing the Superfund
program and attempting to stimulate the reuse of abandoned
industrial sites,'' he said. ``But the details on insuring public
health protection are critically important, and it's not clear
whether the proposal achieves that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's plan would extend the life of a program that was
created in 1982 to clean up toxic dumps and spills that are not
covered by the federal Superfund program. Since its creation, it
has spent more than $1 billion. The last time it was refinanced was
in 1986, when voters approved a $1.2 billion bond act to pay for
it, but all that money is now either spent or spoken for.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the state's program, formally known as the Inactive
Hazardous Waste Disposal Site Program, has cleaned up more than 300
waste sites, from landfills to abandoned dry-cleaning plants and
gasoline stations, and it is still cleaning 511 others. But it
lacks the money to finish all of those sites or to clean up about
300 other properties identified by state officials as posing a
``significant threat to public health.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's proposal calls for $3.89 billion over the next 20
years, with the costs being evenly split by industry fees and the
state's taxpayer-financed general fund. The proposal particularly
troubled business leaders, who complained that it significantly
raised existing industry fees that are used to help pay for some of
the costs of the Superfund program.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's bill also calls for easing some of the state's strict
cleanup standards in an effort to encourage businesses to develop
long-dormant industrial sites that contain hazardous waste. The
bill would determine the level of cleanliness for a polluted site
depending on how the site would be used. Put another way, a
property to be used for a dry-cleaning plant would not have to be
as thoroughly cleaned as a site intended for a school or day-care
center.
</P>
<P>
   That approach was supported by business leaders and even some
environmentalists. They contend that current standards _ which
require polluted sites to be thoroughly cleaned, no matter what
their ultimate use _ are too costly and have discouraged investors
from developing hundreds of tracts of abandoned industrial sites.
</P>
<P>
   But some environmentalists Wednesday criticized that approach,
saying that no one can be sure how a property will be used in
future years as ownership changes _ though the bill would require a
more extensive cleanup if a property's designated use changed. The
critics also contend that failure to entirely eliminate pollutants
poses a risk to natural resources like groundwater, and that the
bill itself allows the new relaxed cleanup standard to be used even
on properties near such resources.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also seeks to relax some of the rules in the area of
so-called cleanup liability. The current program holds not only the
major polluter of a site responsible for its cleanup, but also a
long list of others _ from banks that foreclosed on contaminated
property to subsequent owners.

NORTH KOREANS SUPER SERIOUS IN PRACTICES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLAREMONT, Calif. _ It's been a sight to see the North Korean
women train at Pomona-Pitzer College this week. Their workouts seem
more like military boot camp than soccer practice.
</P>
<P>
   All the players sport short haircuts. And instead of laughing
and talking during informal scrimmages, the North Koreans conduct
drill after drill in silence. Their coach is the only one who
speaks.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the shoes. As they switch from turf shoes to
soccer boots, they leave their turf shoes perfectly lined-up,
side-by-side _ another sign of the discipline that embodies North
Korean soccer.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea, which meets the looser, singing Nigerians Sunday at
the Rose Bowl in their opening game of the 1999 FIFA Women's World
Cup, is the most secretive team in the tournament. And the team
that has the least contact with the rest of the world rarely grants
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the coaches and players like the media because
we're trying not to divert their attention from the training,''
said Korean secretary Mun Si Song. ``We don't find any positives
from doing interviews. We didn't come here to talk politics, we
came here to play the match and to train.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary general Ryu Song II endorsed those feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not distract the players,'' Song II said. ``Doing any
activities that might affect players while they are conditioning
and training is not good.''
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans are expected to grant required interviews as
the tournament moves on, but for the most part, it is a team that
keeps to itself.
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans are intent on reaching the second round and
qualifying for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, so players follow
strict team guidelines. While Germany and Italy are visiting
Universal Studios and Santa Monica Beach during their short stay in
Los Angeles this week, North Korea has planned no sightseeing
adventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right,'' said Si Song. ``We're here for training and
match, that's all. We have a schedule from the coach and we plan to
follow it.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korea also prefers not to deal with the media because the
questions often turn political.
</P>
<P>
   Since U.S. forces joined South Korea in patrolling disputed
waters in the Yellow Sea after a South Korean gunboat sank a North
Korean gunboat Monday, questions about unrest in the communist
country seem natural.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to say much,'' said Si Song. ``Sometimes we say
something one way and your reporters say it another way.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Women's World All-Star match in February, North
Korean coach Myong Ton Chan dismissed any political questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are problems I do not want talk about,'' Ton Chan said
through an interpreter. ``That kind of thing is not for this forum.
I know there are things, but if I say there are problems or
something, it is not a good thing to say.''
</P>
<P>
   One example of life in North Korea surfaced following a comment
from a North Korean official while the team was training by a golf
course in New Jersey last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we have a golf course in my country,'' he said.
``But I am not sure.''
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is that the North Koreans earned their first
Women's World Cup berth thanks to a 1-0 upset of Japan in the
semifinals of the Asian Cup. In group A with the United States, the
North Koreans will meet the Americans on June 27 in Foxboro, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   What the Americans and other teams do know about North Korea is
that the players are technical, physical and played China tough in
a 2-0 loss in the Asian Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say my country is young and green,'' said Tong Chan back
in February. ``We don't have a lot of experience like the USA, but
we welcome our chance to play them. If you are going to catch a
tiger, you have to get in the cave with them.''
</P>
<P>
   And North Korea might be the most rapidly improving team in the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think women's football is one of the sports close to Korean
women in a physical sense,'' said Kim Hak-Yong, the team's
technical official. ``In elementary schools and higher schools, we
have a football class, and each school district has extracurricular
activity for football. We have a program to bring up the women at
all levels and in every age group.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of girls who look forward to becoming a football player
believe this World Cup is an inspiration to the development of our
team.''

EDITORIAL: LESSONS OF THE BALKAN WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, June 17:
</P>
<P>
   As NATO peacekeepers move into Kosovo, they are finding grisly
evidence of Serbian brutality in nearly every town. The signs of
mass killing and wanton destruction in places like Djakovica,
Vlastica and Cikatova ought to give pause to those who fault NATO
for confronting Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. Though
definitive judgments on the war await further developments in the
Balkans and the work of future historians, it is not too soon to
conclude that the air offensive was just, and more effective than
its many critics expected. As an exercise in military and political
coercion, the campaign achieved most of its aims with limited
civilian casualties. Perhaps most important, it demonstrated that
the United States and its allies can act decisively in defense of
democratic principles and against ethnic violence in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first military conflict since the end of the Cold
War fought primarily for humanitarian purposes. It probably will
not be the last. Washington went to war in the Persian Gulf eight
years ago because Iraqi aggression threatened America's economic
welfare. The threat in Kosovo was different. Certainly, maintaining
stability in Europe is essential to U.S. security. But the
immediate hazard in Kosovo was a demonic assault on the principles
of a civilized society. NATO bombed Serbia for 78 days to combat
lethal ethnic cleansing, to reverse the expulsion of more than a
million ethnic Albanians from their homes and to prevent Slobodan
Milosevic from terrorizing the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   That Washington and its European allies were willing to confront
Milosevic is a powerful signal to other tyrants that the
instigation of ethnic violence, even within their own borders, can
reach a point that the world will not tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean the West can or should intervene whenever
ethnic conflict erupts. As a practical matter, intervention should
be confined to cases where violence is extreme and threatens to
engulf neighboring nations and where democratic nations have the
means, as in Kosovo, to respond. The combination will be rare
outside Europe. When possible, such military actions should be
conducted with the approval of the United Nations Security Council.
They should not be initiated without the support of the American
people and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Air power is not a panacea, but the war in Yugoslavia
demonstrated that sustained aerial attack with precision munitions
can erode resistance and bring retreat. Civilian casualties are
inevitable, but NATO worked hard to avoid them. It is a tribute to
U.S. military technology and the skill of NATO pilots that in
almost 10,000 bombing runs no allied airmen were lost and only two
planes were downed. Americans should not count on such success in
every conflict, but the bombardment of Serbia and Iraq suggests
that most air defenses can be defeated by U.S. weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, in its first war, showed surprising cohesion and
determination. Much was made of Germany's opposition to a possible
ground war, and Italy's and Greece's preference to end the bombing,
but in the end the alliance did not crack as the air war was
extended and intensified. This was due in considerable part to the
steady leadership of President Clinton, British Prime Minister Tony
Blair and French President Jacques Chirac. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, raised in the turmoil of earlier European
conflicts, brought great conviction and passion to the fight
against a new kind of chaos.
</P>
<P>
   The mass graves, gutted buildings and torched farmhouses of
Kosovo are not the inevitable product of military conflict. They
are the result of a premeditated assault by Milosevic against
ethnic Albanians. Enforcing the peace in Kosovo will be difficult,
as the events of the last week have shown. Reconstruction will take
months, and reconciliation may be impossible after so much
bloodshed. But to have done nothing in the face of Milosevic's
campaign of terror would have been unconscionable.

J.F. POWERS, 81, DIES; NATIONAL BOOK AWARD WINNER WROTE ABOUT
PRIESTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Minn.)   (rk) 
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   J.F. Powers, who won a National Book Award in 1963 for his first
novel, ``Morte d'Urban,'' and had a long career as a writer of
sardonic but deeply compassionate fiction about Roman Catholic
priests in the Midwest of the United States, died on Saturday at
his home in Collegeville, Minn. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   In his graceful novels and short stories, Powers depicted with
great humor and awareness the subtleties as well as the isolated
nature of the spiritual life. Although he was not a priest, he
seemed to have an interior knowledge of what it meant to be one in
the United States in this century, and he was expert in capturing
the idiom of clerical speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an absolutely masterly comedian and satirist with a
very gentle and delicate touch,'' novelist Mary Gordon said
Wednesday. ``He had one subject and that was priests.''
</P>
<P>
   Extolling Powers' ``precision of form,'' she added, ``At the
heart of his compassion was that his characters were in an
impossible profession, as intermediaries between God and men,'' as
men who were very much involved in the culture of the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Powers had a small body of work, and he never achieved a wide
popularity. But he had fervent admirers in Britain as well as the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Writing about Powers' first collection of stories, ``Prince of
Darkness,'' Evelyn Waugh said that he ``is almost unique in his
country as a lay writer who is at ease in the Church; whose whole
art, moreover, is everywhere infused and directed by his faith.''
Frank O'Connor said he was ``among the greatest living
storytellers'' and Sean O'Faolain called him ``a one-man show at
the top level of short story writing.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Powers' first important story, ``Lions, Harts, Leaping Does,''
was published in Accent, a literary quarterly, in 1943 and then
appeared four years later in ``Prince of Darkness and Other
Stories.'' Five of the 11 stories in that collection dealt with the
Roman Catholic Church, and with priests who were dying or were
spiritually bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   The other six were nonecclesiastical, and several concerned
blacks in the United States; they were filled with sympathy for the
overlooked and repressed, which was one of the author's principal
concerns in his fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prince of Darkness'' was followed by a second collection,
``The Presence of Grace,'' in 1956, and then by ``Morte d'Urban,''
which began as a short story and then was expanded into a novel.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the book is Father Urban, a priestly go-getter
and charmer who turns a neglected religious center into a golf
course. On his own terms, Father Urban retains a sense of
dedication to his calling. To him, priests are ``those heroic
family doctors of the soul.''
</P>
<P>
   After Powers won the book award, Pete Hamill characterized the
author's territory: ``He has etched curates and monsignors dueling
for the favors of a bishop; old pastors outfoxing young assistants;
bored bishops made uncomfortable by the zeal of young priests. His
theme is almost always the conflict between the true religious
spirit and a not exactly religious commercial practice, and his
heroes are men _ not saints or devils.''
</P>
<P>
   The award was a surprise to Powers; rival candidates included
Vladimir Nabokov, John Updike and Katherine Anne Porter.
</P>
<P>
   His third collection of stories, ``Look How the Fish Live,'' was
published in 1975, but it was not until 1988 that he had a second
novel, ``Wheat That Springeth Green.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview that year, he tried to explain that gap: his
wife was sick, he was innately lazy. But much of the delay seemed
to derive from the fact that his first novel had found only a
limited audience, despite winning that award. As a result, he said,
he was ``somewhat despairing.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing Powers' second novel in The New York Times Book
Review, Amy Edith Johnson said, ``Perhaps the publication of this
splendid second novel will scandalize the literary establishment
into rushing Powers' earlier works back into print.'' She added,
``The beauty of Powers' writing lies in its art's being almost
invisible.'' ``Wheat'' was nominated for a National Book Award.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, the author follows the life of Joe Hackett. When
Joe enters the seminary, the author writes:
</P>
<P>
   ``He had grown up. Now he knew what he was doing, or, anyway,
what he was trying to do _ simply the hardest job in the world:
getting to know God, growing more like God, growing in holiness.
Holiness ... was the only ambition worthy of the priest and
therefore of candidates for the priesthood. Holiness was the point
of all the lives of the saints, the point where all those glorious
lives converged, and what the whole world was crying for.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the book, after he has been a priest for many
years, Joe wonders about his soul: ``Still, you never knew where
you were in the spiritual life; that was the hell of it _ only God
knew.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   James Farl Powers was born in Jacksonville, Ill., and grew up as
a Roman Catholic in a largely Protestant town. One of his boyhood
heroes was Sinclair Lewis, and it was no surprise that in common
with Lewis, as a writer he was able to satirize life in small-town
America.
</P>
<P>
   When his family moved to Quincy, Ill., he studied with
Franciscan friars at Quincy Academy. Several of his classmates
entered the priesthood. ``I never wanted to be a priest,'' Powers
said. ``Although part of it was the celibacy, it was more the
matter of being on call to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead he moved to Chicago, where he held a variety of jobs
while trying to be a writer. He attended Northwestern University
but left before graduation and worked for a time in a bookstore,
where he met Richard Wright and Nelson Algren. After taking part in
religious retreats, he wrote ``Lions, Harts, Leaping Does,'' and
that, in effect, began his literary career.
</P>
<P>
   As a pacifist, he refused to be inducted into the Army during
World War II. For that refusal, he was confined for more than a
year at the Sandstone Prison in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   After he was released in 1944 he worked as a hospital orderly
and continued to write stories. In 1951 he and his family moved to
Ireland and for the next several decades lived both there and in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   His stories were published in The New Yorker as well as in
smaller literary journals. For many years he also taught writing,
and was a writer in residence and professor of English at St.
John's University in Collegeville.
</P>
<P>
   Powers' wife, Elizabeth, died in 1988. He is survived by four
children, Katherine Anne, who lives in Cambridge, Mass., and writes
a book column for the Boston Sunday Globe; James, Hugh and Jane,
all of Ireland, and four grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, after his wife's death, he expressed his own
questioning about the existence of God, indicating that his belief
was instinctive. As someone who wrote so often about matters of
faith, he said: ``There are people who believe nothing I've said
about there being a God and a next world. Maybe they're right.'' He
added, ``I have to believe, or else I can't believe in anything.''
After a pause, he concluded: ``Maybe I'd believe in art. Art is
there to be discovered out of God.''

<P>
   As universities race to establish research centers in the
growing field of genomics, Princeton University on Wednesday
announced a $35 million gift for its new Institute for Integrative
Genomics. The gift will cover nearly half of the $75 million
Princeton is trying to raise for the institute.
</P>
<P>
   The gift is part of a $55 million donation by an insurance
company executive, Peter B. Lewis, a 1955 Princeton graduate and
university trustee who has also made major gifts to arts
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   It is the second-largest gift Princeton has received, after the
$100 million pledged by a Hong Kong businessman, Gordon Y.S. Wu, in
1995. Although Wu has encountered business difficulties in recent
years, a Princeton spokesman said Wednesday that his gift was still
on track.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who is chairman and chief executive of the Progressive
Corp., an insurance company based in Cleveland, said in a statement
Wednesday that what drew his interest to Princeton's genomics
center was the way young scientists from many fields would converge
to try to develop an important new scientific discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a risk-taker myself, and this new institute
seems very much in that spirit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the mapping of the human genome nearly complete, Princeton
researchers hope to use analytic tools from physics, chemistry,
computer science, mathematics and engineering to study how various
genes work together in living organisms.
</P>
<P>
   Other organizations that have announced major research
initiatives intended to build on the genome sequencing work that is
nearly complete include Harvard University, Stanford University,
Cornell University and the Scripps Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley M. Tilghman, the Howard A. Prior Professor of the Life
Sciences at Princeton and director of its genome institute, said
money raised for the institute would pay for a new building and
equipment and also for the research itself. The field is so new and
so interdisciplinary, she said, that researchers will have to take
many risks and therefore could find it difficult to raise grant
money to pay for their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The really exciting thing about the Lewis gift,'' she said,
``is that it will allow us to give these young people five years of
secure funding _ core funding with which they can try new things.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Lewis pledged $50 million to the Solomon R.
Guggenheim Museum, of which he is chairman. It was one of the
largest cash gifts made to any visual arts institution and the
largest the Guggenheim had ever received. He also helped create the
Cleveland Center for Contemporary Art.

CERNER SEEKS TAX BREAKS FOR $237 MILLION EXPANION IN NORTH KANSAS
CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH and MIKE RICE  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move that could more than double its area employment,
Cerner Corp. is proposing a $237 million expansion of its North
Kansas City headquarters campus.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the project would be built in five phases over 15
years, from 2000 to 2015, and would have space for an additional
3,600 employees. The development would be about one-third the size
of the new Sprint Corp. campus being built in Overland Park, Kan.,
a Kansas City suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Cerner, one of the world's biggest developers of health-care
information technology, is asking for about $42.09 million in
property tax abatements under Missouri's Chapter 353 redevelopment
law. Officials said Cerner needs the tax breaks to compensate for
the added costs of building on the site's silty, erosion-prone
soil.
</P>
<P>
   Cerner is pursuing the project at a time when its bottom line is
being squeezed by competition, belt-tightening in the health-care
industry and fallout from potential customers delaying purchases
because of the year 2000 computer bug.
</P>
<P>
   The company's earnings and stock also have been pressured in
recent years by expenditures to develop its HNA Millennium
software. Cerner has spent about $150 million on the software,
which is designed to loop together the information systems of
hospitals, pharmacies, laboratories, doctors' offices and other
health-related entities.
</P>
<P>
   But Glenn Tobin, Cerner's executive vice president and chief
operating officer, said Wednesday that the campus expansion was an
``absolutely natural step. We are reaching the end of available
space on this campus. To grow, we need a place to put those
people'' the company plans to hire.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said Cerner expects its headquarters employment to double
in the next three to five years, from 1,600 to 3,200.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said the added office space ultimately could hold 3,600
more workers than the company now employs at its headquarters,
though he did not estimate an employment figure by the project's
completion in 2015.
</P>
<P>
   Cerner officials, who noted that the company's employment rolls
have doubled in the past few years, expect continued rapid growth
from sales of its new family of software products and consulting
services.
</P>
<P>
   Mike T. White, a lawyer representing Cerner, said the company
had received feelers from other cities seeking Cerner's
headquarters. White and Cerner officials declined to identify those
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said Cerner is ``not actively seeking out those offers nor
are we entertaining them. We believe there is a lot of opportunity
in North Kansas City to bring together highly valued workers from
throughout the Midwest and the United States. We believe it is very
good business to be located in (metropolitan) Kansas City.''
</P>
<P>
   Cerner, founded in 1979, moved to North Kansas City in 1981. It
bought the property northeast of Missouri 210 and Walker Road in
1994. Of the 98 acres, 43 are developed.
</P>
<P>
   The Cerner campus currently consists of six office buildings and
an associate center with meeting rooms, a fitness center and a
child-care facility, for a total of 500,000 square feet of
developed space. Most of the buildings were built in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion would add nine office buildings of one to five
stories, for about 1 million square feet of new office space.
</P>
<P>
   It also would add three parking garages and surface lots that
would increase parking capacity from 1,850 to 4,700 spaces. It
would include about 45,000 square feet of renovations at two
existing buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion is meant only for Cerner's use and not for leases
to other companies, Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Sprint's 3.9 million-square-foot campus in
Overland Park will cost nearly $1 billion. That includes the cost
of installing Sprint's new ION advanced communications technology,
as well as a recently approved addition to the project.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed 353 plan, the new Cerner buildings would
receive 100 percent real estate property tax abatements for 10
years and then pay 50 percent of its real estate taxes for 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   Some North Kansas City leaders were skeptical about the Chapter
353 plan when it was presented at a City Council meeting Tuesday.
Councilman Merle Walker asked why the financing tool was needed
when the seven existing buildings were constructed without such tax
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   White said Wednesday that the existing buildings were on land
that is flatter than the proposed expansion site. He said the
company probably will not proceed with the expansion if the tax
breaks are not approved.
</P>
<P>
   Cerner would make payments in lieu of taxes to the taxing
authorities in the project area.
</P>
<P>
   White said developing the project with the requested tax
abatements would generate $27.3 million in real estate taxes over
25 years. If the project is not developed, the real estate taxes on
the existing headquarters complex would be $15.5 million during the
same period, White said.
</P>
<P>
   White said the 353 plan would not cut personal business property
taxes on items such as new computer systems. The expansion would
triple the company's personal property taxes from an annual
$370,000 to $924,000, according to a report prepared by Cerner.
Annual utility taxes would grow from $45,000 to $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   George DeFrench, city administrator for North Kansas City, said
the Cerner project would be one of only a handful of 353
redevelopment projects approved by the city. It would be the city's
first such project to include a finding of blight based on the soil
conditions of vacant land, he said.
</P>
<P>
   DeFrench said the City Council would discuss the Cerner proposal
further in a week or two. If the council agrees to proceed, a
public hearing will be held. A final vote by the council could come
at or after the public hearing.

SPORTS COLUMN: IT'S A GREAT SERIES: IS ANYBODY WATCHING? 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Derian Hatcher, the captain of the Dallas Stars, is a
big, tough, talented defenseman with an intimidating style and a
rap sheet to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher began the two-month Stanley Cup tournament under a
five-game suspension because his vicious check put Jeremy Roenick
of Phoenix into the boards and out of action with a broken jaw. In
a previous game, Roenick's hard hit had hurt Mike Modano, the
scoring star of the Stars. Hatcher's retaliation is the way hockey
players sometimes settle such scores.
</P>
<P>
   Before the final round against the Buffalo Sabres, when asked if
he accepted terms such as ``scary'' and ``dangerous'' and
``intimidating'' as complimentary, Hatcher chuckled and said,
``Well, I would have to.'' He added: ``I don't know if guys should
be scared, but if they are, I guess I am doing my job.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night in Buffalo's new Marine Midland Arena, a 2-1
Sabres victory that sent the series back to Dallas tied at two
victories apiece, even an unsophisticated fan or television
director could see several Sabres charging full speed toward
Hatcher, hurling their smaller bodies into his 6-foot-5-inch,
225-pound frame. Even Dominik Hasek, the Sabres' goalie, greeted
Hatcher with a gratuitous bump that prompted a four-penalty melee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dom's got a black belt,'' Sabres coach Lindy Ruff said. ``So
he'll be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not to suggest that Hatcher and the Stars are
intimidated by the Sabres, a younger, lesser-paid team that
finished far below league-leading Dallas in the 82-game regular
season. It is merely to illustrate the intensity of competition in
what may be the NHL's best championship round of the decade after
four consecutive years of four-game sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   Challenging Hatcher in this manner is like clicking a stick
along the bars of a lion's cage or lighting cherry bombs while
pumping gasoline. But this sort of thing is happening all over the
ice in most minutes of every game. When asked if he felt like a
target, Hatcher said Wednesday: ``Yeah, sometimes I feel like they
are coming at me. I am a big guy. I can handle it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher's Stars still should win this series, which resumes
Thursday night in Dallas. Even though the Sabres have the reigning
most valuable player in Hasek, the Stars have more talented players
and they have more playoff experience. Two of the remaining three
games are in Reunion Arena, an older building with newer fans who
match the passion of the Sabres supporters but lack both their
Canadian-border hockey hipness and Buffalo's sincere, almost
painful yearning for a championship after decades of civic
deprivation, inside and outside sports.
</P>
<P>
   If the Sabres have an advantage, it is in their youth and
relative freshness at the end of a nine-month grind of more than
100 games, the hardest ones last. Dallas played three longer,
tougher rounds in this tournament and the Stars are hurting the
most.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull missed most of Game 3 and all of Game 4 with a groin
pull and his return is questionable for Game 5. Modano is playing
with an injured left wrist that hampers his stick-handling, passing
and shooting. The rest of the Stars, gnarled old pros, throw
themselves in front of speeding pucks the way soldier-heroes jumped
on hand grenades in the old war movies. Surely these slap shots
have left their welts and contusions.
</P>
<P>
   By now, even the savvy hockey mavens who complained in advance
about the defensive orientation of these teams have to acknowledge
that low scoring isn't necessarily boring when both sides use
high-pressure checking systems instead of the passive neutral-zone
trap so popular at mid-decade with finalists like the Devils and
the Florida Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   But, outside the hockey cult, in places such as basketball-mad
New York, does anyone else notice the drama? No matter the
marketing rationale, it is preposterous to extend a hockey season
until the hot days of mid-June, when baseball approaches midseason
and hockey players complain about mushy ice.
</P>
<P>
   As for attracting a broader television audience, it is
self-defeating to show the games from Dallas on the Fox network,
which frequently interrupts its horrid camera work with lengthy
commercial breaks and smutty promos for silly sitcoms.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey buffs who grudgingly concede that their sport does not
translate perfectly to television have learned one hard lesson from
the soon-to-end Fox experiment: that low camera angles and
ill-timed close-ups away from the puck make hockey almost
incomprehensible to even veteran viewers.
</P>
<P>
   So, we close this season and this rant with a version of the old
catcall usually aimed from the cheap seats to the referees: Hey,
Fox! Hey, America! Open your eyes! You're missing some great games!

DR. BRUNO BALKE, 91, INNOVATOR IN STUDY OF PHYSICAL CONDITIONING
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Colo., Wis., Ore.)  (nk) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bruno Balke, a sports medicine innovator who preached a regimen
of sensible exercise as an antidote to heart ailments, died on June
7 at St. Mary's Hospital in Grand Junction, Colo. He was 91 and had
lived in Grand Junction in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Balke was credited with being the first exercise physiologist to
chart the precise relationship among oxygen consumption, exercise
and cardiovascular health. At a time when bed rest was the general
prescription for heart patients, he was an early advocate of
heart-strengthening exercises of the kind that became popular in
the 1970s with the growth of aerobics and fitness salons.
</P>
<P>
   Balke was a professor emeritus of physiology and kinesiology at
the University of Wisconsin in Madison. Earlier in his career he
accompanied a German expedition in the Himalayas, tested the
stamina of German Alpine troops in World War II and helped the U.S.
Air Force determine how the human body could adapt to space flight.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Braunschweig, Germany, he graduated from the German
Academy of Physical Education in 1931. He earned his medical degree
at the University of Berlin in 1936 and added a doctorate in
medical rehabilitation at the University of Leipzig in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   From 1936 to 1942, Balke was affiliated with the department of
sports medicine at the University of Berlin. As the team physician
for German climbers in the Himalayas in 1938, he found an interest
that would last the rest of his life: high-altitude conditioning
and human endurance under extreme stress.
</P>
<P>
   He served in the German medical corps in World War II but
contracted infectious hepatitis on the Russian front. After that,
he was posted to the medical school of the German Army Mountain
Corps to lead its department of performance physiology.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Air Force recruited him for its School of Aviation
Medicine in 1950. That allowed him to continue his research in San
Antonio, where in 1958 he subjected himself to 10 grueling days in
a simulated space capsule.
</P>
<P>
   Later he became chief of the biodynamics branch at the Civil
Aeromedical Research Institute of the Federal Aviation
Administration, joined the faculty of the University of Wisconsin,
worked with the Green Bay Packers football team, helped American
athletes prepare for the high altitude of the Mexico City Olympics
in 1968 and led a committee that created Medicine and Science in
Sports, which became the journal of the American College of Sports
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Balke's wife, Annemarie, died in 1996. He is survived by three
sons, Horst, of Basalt, Colo.; Frank, of Salem, Ore., and Per-Olof,
of Grand Junction; a daughter, Hedda Marg of Alzey, Germany; 11
grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.

PATAKI URGES MONEY CURBS IN CAMPAIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki proposed Wednesday that New
York for the first time place significant restrictions on the way
politicians raise and spend money. But the governor waited to
present his long-promised campaign finance plan until the last
scheduled day of the Legislature's session, giving the measure _
unpopular among lawmakers anyway _ almost no chance of passage in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki plan would sweep away a system that has, in practice,
allowed parties and candidates to collect virtually any amount of
money from anyone, with little fear of punishment for violating the
few existing rules. The proposal would ban unregulated
contributions, lower many contribution limits and step up
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's timing spurred some Democrats and advocacy groups
to question whether he was announcing the measure mostly so that he
could portray himself as a reformer, while having little interest
in actually bringing about change. Pataki, who has been the most
successful fund-raiser in the state's history, shrugged off the
attacks. He said he stood behind the plan and hoped the Legislature
would eventually approve it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fair and good proposal and I will work to try and
get it passed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the governor made his comments at a news conference during
which he was notably alone at the podium, unaccompanied by any of
the legislators who typically join him at such events.
</P>
<P>
   By late in the day, it became clear that he had done little in
either major party to garner the support of lawmakers, who are
generally resistant to toughening the state's lax campaign finance
system. The existing rules bestow major advantages on incumbents _
the same men and women who would have to vote to modify them.
</P>
<P>
   Even Pataki's staunchest Republican allies, state Senate
Majority Leader Joseph Bruno and Republican State Committee
chairman William Powers, declined to endorse the package of
measures.

FACTS HAZY ABOUT EPIC GUNFIGHT AT OK CORRAL  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CLAY THOMPSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ To begin with, ``OK Corral'' has a nice, snappy,
Western sound, perfect for the site of a shoot-'em-up.
</P>
<P>
   If the event had taken place at, say, Fred's Corral or the OK
Bathhouse, the Old West's most famous gunfight might not have
become so famous.
</P>
<P>
   And thanks to the fuzziness of contemporary accounts _ plus all
the subsequent yarn spinning and moviemaking and book writing _ the
history of that bloody day is still not particularly certain and
the story is all the more enduring.
</P>
<P>
   This much, we think, we know for sure:
</P>
<P>
   About 2:30 p.m. Oct. 26, 1881, in a vacant lot behind the OK
Corral in Tombstone, Ariz., Virgil Earp, the marshal of Tombstone;
his brothers Wyatt and Morgan, and their pal John ``Doc'' Holliday
shot it out with brothers Ike and Billy Clanton, Tom and Frank
McLaury, and Billy Claiborne.
</P>
<P>
   When the shooting stopped 27 seconds later, more than 30 shots
had been fired. Wyatt Earp was unscathed, his brothers were
seriously wounded and Holliday had a scratch.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, the McLaurys and Billy Clanton were killed,
Billy begging right up to the end for someone to hand him one
bullet so he could get another shot off at the Earps.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, 2,000 people turned out for the funerals of
Clanton and the McLaurys.
</P>
<P>
   The story Hollywood has given us casts the Earps and Holliday as
white-hatted lawmen, outnumbered but bravely facing the blazing
guns of a passel of no-good rustlers.
</P>
<P>
   The truth of course, if there is any, is less clear-cut. The
Earps and their hangers-on drifted into Arizona about 1880 from
Dodge City, Kan., where they had been known as the Fighting Pimps.
</P>
<P>
   The Clanton faction, on the other hand, were ranchers, though
not exactly noble sons of the prairies. They had been accused over
the years of rustling, thievery, harboring fugitives and general
orneriness.
</P>
<P>
   There was bad blood between the two sides for several months
before things came to a head at the OK Corral.
</P>
<P>
   The story of that bad blood fills several pages of colorful
Arizona history and involves stagecoach robberies, smuggling, women
of doubtful character and various people on both sides taking
potshots at each other and whacking each other over the head.
</P>
<P>
   The source of the feud boils down to this: Wyatt Earp, a
Republican, was banking on being appointed sheriff of the newly
formed Cochise County. Instead, the job went to a Democrat, John
Behan, a Clanton ally.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt's motives were not all based on his thirst for law and
justice. In ``Arizona,'' historian Marshall Trimble notes: ``Being
a law enforcement officer could be quite lucrative in those days
when the citizenry was more tolerant of certain extracurricular
activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Between the shakedowns and tax-skimmings that could have been
his, Wyatt Earp was out about $30,000 or $40,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   So the bad blood simmered and boiled until Oct. 26, 1881, a day
that left Tombstone on the western mythology map forever.
</P>
<P>
   In the months following the Gunfight at the OK Corral, Wyatt
Earp and Doc Holliday faced a monthlong hearing on murder charges
and were cleared. Virgil Earp was wounded in an assassination
attempt and Morgan Earp was murdered while shooting pool. Wyatt
Earp eventually killed three men he believed murdered his brother
and left Cochise County for Colorado, never to return. &QL; 
John Behan went on to serve as superintendent of the territorial
prison in Yuma.
</P>
<P>
   Ike Clanton eventually was shot and killed by a private
detective. Virgil Earp died in Nevada in 1905. Holliday died of
tuberculosis in Colorado in 1887.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt Earp died in 1929 in Los Angeles, hoping to the end that
William S. Hart would play him in a movie based on his life. He
didn't. &QL;

   Don't be surprised if Jackson, who officially became the Los
Angeles Lakers head coach Wednesday, is reunited with his longtime
assistant and master of the triangle offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've given me free opportunity to pick my own staff,''
Jackson said during his press conference at the Beverly Hilton. He
wouldn't, however, go as far as to name names until the team's
incumbent staff is consulted.
</P>
<P>
   But the first name might be Winter's.
</P>
<P>
   If Jackson is the high priest of sideline karma, Winter _ who
just finished his 14th season as a Chicago Bulls assistant _
qualifies as the Jedi prophet of offensive flow. His celebrated
system served as Michael Jordan's tactical censor during six NBA
championship runs by Jackson and the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   So after a season of separation, is Winter planning to ride
shotgun for Jackson again?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little premature for that,'' Winter said Wednesday from
the Bulls' Berto Center complex, which remains home at least
through the length of a contract that expires June 30. ``Phil's a
little busy with things out there, but I'm sure we'll talk.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a Bulls source, Bulls coach Tim Floyd has been
advised to start interviewing for Winter's position.
</P>
<P>
   While carefully articulating his interest in working for the
Lakers, Winter did inquire about the location of the team's new
practice home, as well as the construction progress at Staples
Center. The 76-year-old Winter knows his way around town, having
played at USC, then returning as head coach at Long Beach State for
five seasons (1978-83).
</P>
<P>
   ``The triangle is something that just evolved,'' said Winter,
who credits Sam Barry, his coach at USC, with providing basic
principles he's tweaked during each stage of a 53-year coaching
career. ``I think it's pretty simple, and it has to be, because I'm
a rather simple-minded guy.''
</P>
<P>
   But the inevitable caterwauling of critics already has suggested
the young, me-oriented Lakers will be unable to assimilate what is
perceived as a sophisticated scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``The better you are as a basketball player,'' Winter said,
``the better the triangle will be. If you don't have the talent, it
can be difficult. This year with the Bulls, we had marginal
players, really, so we struggled.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the Lakers don't seem to have that problem.''
</P>
<P>
   No, the Lakers seem to have the talent requirement licked, but
will a system that traded on the versatility of Jordan and Scottie
Pippen invalidate the low-post lease of Shaquille O'Neal?
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I'm biased,'' Winter said, ``but with a dominant
center, it (triangle) should work even better. And it should help
Kobe (Bryant) the way it did Michael. It's a five-man concept, but
it adjusts to your personnel. That's the great thing about it.''
</P>
<P>
   During Jackson's last three (championship) seasons in Chicago,
the low-post hub of the triangle was Luc Longley, whose offensive
flair was overshadowed by his ability to achieve a
body-surfing-related injury. Longley averaged 11.4 points per game
in his last Bulls run but dipped to 8.7 this season while playing
for Phoenix in a more NBA-conventional offense.
</P>
<P>
   As Winter points out, the triangle will promote plenty of
opportunities for O'Neal to get his hands on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just have to see how good he is at passing it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where Jackson comes in.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he joined the Bulls, Phil had a selling job to do with
Michael,'' Winter said of the crucial Jordan endorsement. ``He
could have sabotaged everything. So could Shaq and Kobe.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think that's Phil's strength. He's a great motivator and
a good psychologist.''

   PHOENIX _ He's a small slender man with a long narrow face, a
long thin nose and a bald spot on the back of his head that'll get
bigger as he ages. But for now he looks young and, in his large
oval spectacles, innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom, where he's on trail for stabbing his wife
44 times and dumping her body in the family pool, he reminds you of
Don Knotts in ``The Incredible Mr. Limpet,'' a character whose bad
eyesight and wimpy physique keeps him from passing the army
physical.
</P>
<P>
   `` '' It's exactly the image Scott Falater's lawyers want the
jury to see.
</P>
<P>
   A weakling.
</P>
<P>
   A nebbish.
</P>
<P>
   All Wednesday morning, as he has throughout his trial, Falater
sat studiously at the defense table _ the bookish kid in science
class who purposefully sits in the front row.
</P>
<P>
   He wore a dark suit and a dark tie, occasionally making notes on
a legal pad with a perfectly sharpened pencil, occasionally
crossing his arms over his chest, always with his eyes fixed
attentively at the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Ronald Reinstein's fourth floor courtroom was jammed with
family members, reporters and courthouse gawkers as word spread
that Falater was about to testify in his own defense, to say with
his boyishly straight face that he was sleepwalking when he carved
up his wife, Yarmila, and tried to hide the bloody evidence. &QL; 
Looks are everything &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Falater must know that nothing he says could excuse such horror.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers know.
</P>
<P>
   They know that neither sleepwalking experts nor their client's
testimony will convince jurors to set him free.
</P>
<P>
   His appearance, however, just might.
</P>
<P>
   No one, not even the defense's experts, can say they're 100
percent sure Falater was sleepwalking on the night of his wife's
death. But everyone, from the judge to the guy who sweeps out the
courtroom, is 100 percent sure he killed her.
</P>
<P>
   And yet there he sat, calm, unflinching, even as the temperature
rose in the courtroom. He didn't remove his jacket. He didn't
sweat.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear this is the best and boldest method for trying get
away with murder. Admit to the killing and ask jurors to set you
free anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Without ever speaking, everything about Falater says, ``Look at
me, I'm a twirp, a mama's boy. I could never do such a thing if I
was awake. I ``must'' have been sleepwalking.''
</P>
<P>
   His story is that he was asleep and went outside to fix the pool
pump in a trance-like state. The ``tool`` he brought with him was a
knife.
</P>
<P>
   (Perhaps he couldn't find the hunting rifle he normally uses for
home repair.)
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer says his wife interrupted him in his sleep and he
hacked her up, rolled her into the water, then packed the knife and
his bloody clothes into a plastic container, which he wrapped in a
plastic bag and hid in the wheel well of his Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, when he ``awoke'' and was told about what happened,
he didn't fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   He was calm, like Wednesday. &QL; 
No explanation, no excuse &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the courtroom, he smiled at relatives and made notes on a
legal pad while lawyers argued over the scientific viability of
sleep experts and no one discussed poor Yarmila.
</P>
<P>
   In this day and age, ordinary victims aren't nearly as
interesting as extraordinary defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they manage to convince a juror or two that Falater was
asleep during the murder, those people will still have to ask, `'So
what?''
</P>
<P>
   It's an explanation, not an excuse. There is no excuse.
</P>
<P>
   And if Scott Falater, who took the stand Wednesday afternoon,
was the pious, law-abiding man his lawyers claim he is, he wouldn't
be looking to weasel out of responsibility for his wife's death.
</P>
<P>
   It's a B-movie performance going at the courthouse, a show.
</P>
<P>
   I got the actor right but I picked the wrong Don Knotts picture.

HAROLD KOHN, 85, LAWYER IN CLASS-ACTION CASES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (rk) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harold E. Kohn, a lawyer who filed some of the earliest class
action lawsuits accusing corporations of anti-competitive
practices, died Monday at his home in Philadelphia, a law partner
said. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Kohn became nationally known when he won a key
case against General Electric, Westinghouse and two dozen other
companies that the federal government had charged with illegally
fixing the prices of the electrical equipment they sold.
</P>
<P>
   Customers who had purchased the equipment filed hundreds of
civil lawsuits against the companies. Kohn's case, brought on
behalf of public utilities, was the first to go to trial and
resulted in a $29 million verdict.
</P>
<P>
   During the litigation, the courts began consolidating the
hundreds of cases and handling them as if they constituted several
large class-action lawsuits. After the lawsuits were settled, Kohn
helped draft some of the rules that courts began to use in
class-action cases. Soon, he and other lawyers around the company
were filing class-action lawsuits against numerous companies,
charging them with fixing the prices of products as diverse as
plumbing fixtures, antibiotics, paper and sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Kohn brought a class action lawsuit against the timber industry,
and the jury awarded his clients $2 billion in 1981, then the
largest verdict in an antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   But Kohn also brought public interest cases on the behalf of the
American Civil Liberties Union and other groups. During the Vietnam
War, he helped file a case that contended that the military draft
was unconstitutional because it excluded women. The case went all
the way to the Supreme Court, which ruled in 1981 that the
exclusion of women did not violate the Fifth Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Kohn also represented Ralph Ginzburg, the publisher, who was
trying to appeal his 1963 conviction for mailing obscene
literature. Ultimately, Ginzburg, who had been sentenced to five
years in prison, was paroled after eight months.
</P>
<P>
   In 1937, Kohn graduated first in his class from the University
of Pennsylvania Law School. In 1939, he began practicing law at the
Philadelphia firm of Murdoch, Paxon, Kalish &AMP; Green, which later
changed its name to Dilworth, Paxon, Kalish, Kohn &AMP; Dilks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Kohn formed his own law firm, which is now known as
Kohn, Swift &AMP; Graf.
</P>
<P>
   Kohn is survived by his wife, Edith; three daughters, Amy Kohn
Goldberg, Ellen Kohn Goddard and Lee Ann Glanton; his son, Joseph,
and eight grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   While Kohn became wealthy from the fees he earned on
class-action cases, he often differed with some lawyers who had
helped bring the antitrust cases on the issue of legal fees. At
times, Kohn argued that the fees that his colleagues were
requesting were too high.

EDITORIAL: PATAKI'S CAMPAIGN REFORM CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid the gloom that has settled over New York state's do-nothing
Legislature this session, Gov. George Pataki on Wednesday offered a
flicker of enlightenment. It came with his long-awaited campaign
finance reform package, which the governor wants in time for next
year's elections. The package, announced as this session moves to a
close, instantly sent grumbles through the Statehouse where
legislators do little more than talk about reforming one of the
least savory campaign financing systems in the country. But what
the governor has presented could be a starting point for real
reform _ especially if the details match the promises and if the
Pataki political clout is securely attached to it.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's package leaves some questions and issues unresolved,
especially since many of the details are yet to emerge. Most
disappointingly, the proposal falls short of authorizing public
campaign funding for candidates and setting spending limits, the
best hope of generating competition for members of the state
Assembly or Senate whose election is now tantamount to legislative
tenure. Last year the re-election rate for incumbents was 100
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's interest in the issue, however, stirs an
unfamiliar hope that New York's lax campaign financing system,
which has few limits on raising or spending money, could become a
thing of the past. Pataki announced that his plan would reduce
campaign contribution limits from $30,700 to $5,000, ban
housekeeping slush funds for political parties, crack down on sham
``issue ads,'' require more disclosure by candidates and toughen
enforcement of campaign laws.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, his proposal aims to curb the fund-raising hustle that
has overtaken recent legislative sessions. With New York's feeble
lobbying law set to expire this year, a few legislators are trying
to limit influence-buying by lobbyists rather than extending the
old law that only loosely regulates such activities in the state
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with proposed changes to their job protection plan,
legislators quickly took on self-protective tones. Minutes after
the governor announced his plan, it was being called a last-minute
distraction designed more to create better press coverage than to
produce decent legislation. Although Democrats have for years been
pushing for even stronger versions of campaign reform, such
criticism misses the point. This is a good starting place for
negotiations to end the easy influence of money in Albany.

HULL'S RETURN MAY HELP STARS' OFFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Brett Hull danced on the ice yesterday afternoon
at the Dr Pepper StarCenter. He had bounce, he had energy, he had
jump.
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Brett skated despite a sore groin and flicked pucks
at the net from every angle. He went top shelf, he aimed for the
corners, he threw backhands and his patented snap shots and rarely
failed to find twine.
</P>
<P>
   And all the Stars need is for one of those pucks to nestle into
the back of the net tonight at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   What difference can Brett Hull make? With or without Hull, the
Stars have one goal in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably one goal,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said, only
half-joking.
</P>
<P>
   It has come down to that, this nail-biting best-of-seven Stanley
Cup series between the Stars and Buffalo Sabres that resumes tied
2-2 with Game 5 at 7 tonight at Reunion Arena. Brett Hull's return
from a groin injury could mean one additional goal for the Stars.
Benoit Hogue's return from a severely sprained knee could mean one
goal. The improvement of Mike Modano's wrist after another day goal
could result in one extra goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's been the difference,'' center Guy Carbonneau said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nearly 13 periods of hockey played in the Stanley Cup
Finals, the games have been within one goal for all but 26 seconds.
One goal in mind? It's not just the Stanley Cup, it's the theme of
this series _ finding any way to score one goal.
</P>
<P>
   After missing Game 4, Hull has been upgraded from doubtful to
questionable and could be moved to probable if he has a good skate
this morning. Can he add one goal?
</P>
<P>
   Hogue is listed as ``available for selection'' after missing
three weeks with torn ligaments in his left knee. Can he add one
goal?
</P>
<P>
   One goal in mind; it rings true.
</P>
<P>
   Were you frustrated you couldn't help in Game 4, Brett?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an understatement,'' Hull said. ``Especially in that
one-goal game when I think the majority of people agree the one
thing I can do is score goals. And to be just that one short, it's
as frustrating as you can imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars know the drill on Sabres goalie Dominik Hasek, who
lowered his goals against average to 1.83 and raised his save
percentage to .938 after a 2-1 victory in Game 4. The book says
shoot high and get plenty of traffic in front of him. But that's
easier said than done.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much room on either side, so it's really hard,''
Carbonneau said. ``But you get used to it and you know you just
have to work hard for your chances.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, you never know when one player will make a mistake.
You never know when that mistake will lead to a goal, as it did for
Buffalo in Game 4 when Craig Ludwig's turnover turned into Dixon
Ward's game-winning shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't play 55 or 56 minutes, because that's not good
enough now,'' Carbonneau said. ``You have to play 60 minutes... and
more if necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   One goal in mind. Maybe it's the goal of Hull, the thoroughbred
shooter with goal-scorer's lineage. Maybe those hands that have
produced 586 regular-season goals and 76 more in the postseason
don't need the rest of Hull to be completely healthy. Maybe he can
come back on a bad leg and still find the back of the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hands are fine,'' Hull said. ``Hopefully I'll be 80 and the
hands will still be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock called him a ``shark,'' lurking in the open spots on
the ice. Benoit Hogue referred to Hull as a ``caged tiger'' trying
to watch the game from the locker room. Hull could be the wild card
the Stars need.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe, they simply need to play their game and not worry
about forcing a goal against Hasek. Maybe looking for goals would
be playing right into the hands of the Sabres' backstop.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start putting pressure on yourself to score and score
and score, you start giving up odd-man rushes,'' Hitchcock said.
``I don't think we need to start exchanging chances.''
</P>
<P>
   One goal? Maybe the goal is patience. Maybe it's becoming
predatory. Maybe the Stars need a shark or a tiger.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanley Cup Finals have become a best-of-three series and
the Stars have two of those games at home. Their one goal is a
victory and they need at least one goal to do that. However, it
would help if they had more.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides know that's pretty difficult, though.
