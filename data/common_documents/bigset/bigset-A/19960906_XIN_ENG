<P>
WASHINGTON, September 5 (Xinhua)-- Following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- After weeks of mounting tensions, pressures and secret
negotiations, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu finally met face
to face Wednesday with Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader he has
repeatedly reviled during his election campaign.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton said Iraq pulled back most of
its troops from a contested Kurdish enclave following two American
missile strikes.

network commercial as a person of sacrifice and success, utterly
shorn of his economic proposals and even his tenure in the Senate.

<P>
-- President Clinton will appoint a panel to recommend ways of
protecting consumers against changes in the health care industry
that threaten the quality of care.
</P>

<P>
LONDON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher
said here today that their countries welcomed the talks between
Israeli and Palestinian leaders.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat held their first meeting on
the border area between Israel and Gaza Strip on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts say that the meeting marked formal acceptance by
Netanyahu of Arafat as a negotiating partner three years after the
Palestinian leader sealed a peace deal with assassinated Israeli
leader Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after his talks with Christopher this morning, Rifkind
told reporters: "I warmly welcome the meeting between Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and (Palestinian) President
Yasser Arafat and the commitment which both expressed to continuing
the Peace Process and honoring the Oslo accords."
</P>

"I particularly welcome Prime Minister Netanyahu's indication
that he understands the need to improve the economic conditions of
the Palestinian people, and President Arafat's commitment to
continue security cooperation with Israel," Rifkind said.

<P>
The British Foreign Secretary also stressed that "we now look
forward to concrete actions to restore the momentum of the Peace
Process."
</P>
<P>
Christopher, who is on a five-day trip to Britain, France and
Germany, said that the first meeting between Arafat and Netanyahu
was "very significant".
</P>
<P>
"It crossed a psychological threshold that is essential if
there is going to be meaningful progress and it's a first step
that paves the way for the two parties to understand each other's
problems and to begin to work together to resolve those problems,"
Christopher added.

<HEADLINE> Method for Selecting Chief Executive of HKSAR Discussed in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Members of a panel of the
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) have finalized the specific method for selecting the
first Chief Executive of the region.
</P>
<P>
The panel of the first Chief Executive of the Preparatory
Committee held its third meeting here on September 4-5.
</P>
<P>
The panel members agreed that according to the provisions of
the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR, the candidates of the first
Chief Executive shall be Chinese citizens of no less than 40 years
of age and the permanent Hong Kong residents who have lived in
Hong Kong for 20 consecutive years, with no rights of residence in
any foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
They should support the Basic Law and pledge loyalty to the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. They cannot hold any
foreign passports, including the British Dependent Territories
Citizen passport and the British National (Overseas) passport.
</P>
<P>
The civil servants presently serving in Hong Kong who are
willing to stand for election for the post of the Chief Executive
must resign from their present post before the nomination.
</P>
<P>
Candidates for the first Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR
should be nominated through a voting system. Before being
nominated, those who are members of political parties or
organizations must withdraw their memberships.
</P>
<P>
The panel members suggested that the first Chief Executive be
selected by the means of nomination and election after going
through consultations in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Selection Committee will nominate candidates by
endorsement following consultations in Hong Kong. The nominations
will be presided over by the chairman and vice-chairmen of the
Preparatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
Those who are nominated by no less than 50 members of the
Selection Committee must complete required application
forms. After the SAR chairman committee conducts the
qualifications examinations of the applicants, those qualified
will officially become candidates for the first Chief Executive of
the SAR.
</P>
<P>
The candidates should present reports detailing their personal
situation and political programs to the Selection Committee. They
will subsequently be elected by secret ballot by the committee,
and those candidates who have received more than half of the votes
will be elected.
</P>
<P>
Should none of the candidates get more than 50 percent, a
second round of voting will be conducted to choose one of the two
top candidates. Following the voting, the winner will be submitted
by the SAR to the Central People's government for appointment.
</P>
<P>
The selection of the Chief Executive should be completed within
45 days after the Selection Committee is established.
</P>
<P>
The chairman and vice-chairmen of the Preparatory Committee is
held responsible for overseeing the election and handling
complaints.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeni
Primakov and his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel today failed to
solve their differences over the NATO's eastward expansion plan
and the United States' missile strikes in Iraq, reports said.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Primakov told reporters that Russia's position
on NATO membership for former east bloc states "has remained the
same" and that Moscow will continue a dialogue with NATO on the
expansion issue.
</P>
<P>
Without Russia there could be no security in Europe, stressed
Primakov.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said that although Germany and Russia maintained
different positions on NATO, both nations agreed there should be a
new definition of NATO's ties with Russia.
</P>
<P>
On the U.S. missile strikes on Iraq since September 3, Primakov
reiterated Russia's opposition to Washington's use of force against
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
He said that no resolution rejects the right of Iraqi troops to
be in this or that part of Iraqi territory and Moscow had no plan
to intervene in Baghdad's policy.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said that although Bonn and Moscow had different views
on the U.S. missile strikes, both nations agreed there should not
be any escalation of the military conflict.
</P>
<P>
Primakov announced that German President Roman Herzog has been
invited to visit Russia for talks with President Boris Yeltsin on
October 12-14.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl will fly to Russia on September 7
to meet Yeltsin.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Gas Pipeline Project Going on Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- A key part of China's longest
gas pipeline project running through northwestern province of
Shaanxi, and Shanxi and Hebei provinces and Beijing municipality
in north China has been completed.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang Chengzhi, a senior official with the China
National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), the 3.3 billion yuan pipeline
project, starts at Jingbian County in Shaanxi Province and ends at
the Shijingshan District in Beijing, extending through 22 cities
and counties.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the pipeline-laying project, with a length
of 150 kilometers, covers complex and varied landforms and
topography. The project is scheduled to be completed in its
entirety by September of next year. It is expected to start gas
supply to Beijing and Tianjin on September 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The official added that upon completion, the gas transmission
pipeline will have a gas handling capacity of 1.1 billion cu m in
the first several years; it will proceed to reach as high as 2
billion cu m in the later years.
</P>
<P>
The CNPC source said that Beijing and Tianjin have long been
afflicted with power shortages, and suffer from serious air
pollution owing to heavy coal consumption.

<HEADLINE> More FBI Agents to Combat Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno on Thursday confirmed reports the Federal Bureau of
Investigation is planning to shift a number of its agents into
counter-terrorism operations.
</P>
<P>
But Reno said that there is no firm number of agents to be
transferred, that the administration is asking Congress for 108
new agents to fight terrorism and that President Bill Clinton will
be making an announcement once the overall plans are firm.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post Thursday quoted "senior federal law
enforcement officials" as saying that at least 500 agents would be
reassigned to contend with the heightened threat of domestic and
international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In a speech after a terrorist bombing in Saudi Arabia killed 19
U.S. service members in June, Clinton said "the war against
terrorism" had replaced the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the FBI has been called in to investigate the crash
of TWA Flight 800, which killed all 230 people aboard on July 17,
and the pipe bomb explosion in Atlanta's Olympic Centennial Park
which caused the death of two people on July 27.
</P>
<P>
Reno said Thursday the reassignments should not hurt other
areas of FBI operations, such as violent crime and white-collar
crime.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Media Slam US Missile Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi media today lashed out
at series of U.S. missile attacks against military targets and
some residential areas in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The state-run newspapers published front-page stories with
such striking headlines as "the world is with us, the ugly
American is condemned and isolated," and "damned Clinton commits
new and treacherous aggression against our people and country."
</P>
<P>
The daily Al-Thawra, run by the Ruling Baath Socialist Party,
said in an editorial that the day will come for those who
supported U.S. missile strike against Iraq to come and ask to be
forgiven and to let their firms have a stake in Iraqi riches.
</P>
<P>
It is in an apparent reference to those countries who
supported American missile attacks on Iraq, which include Japan,
Germany and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Al-Iraq said that U.S. President Bill Clinton,
like his predecessor, George Bush, will be "nothing other than
the dustbin of history."
</P>
<P>
Baghdad appears calm today after the U.S. launched three
rounds of missile attacks at Iraqi targets since early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But for days, tens of thousands of Iraqis have taken to the
streets in various parts of the country to protest against
American missile attacks and the expansion of the U.N.-imposed
"no-fly" zone in the south of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi dinar has surged to 1,320 for one U.S. dollar from
1,650 just one day ago when U.S. missiles hit Iraq.
</P>
<P>
People are more concerned about the oil-for-food deal signed
by Iraq and the U.N. in May. The implementation of the deal has
been delayed by the U.N. due to Iraqi troops' offensive in the
north to intervene in the fightings between the two Kurdish rival
factions there.

<HEADLINE> IPPF Launches Charter on Sexual and Reproductive Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
London, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Planned
Parenthood Federation (IPPF) today launched the Charter on Sexual
and Reproductive Rights.
</P>
<P>
The charter identifies 12 key rights which the IPPF considers
to be the basic human rights of people within the sphere of sex
and reproduction, says Ingar Brueggemann, secretary-general of
IPPF, the world's largest voluntary family health care association.
</P>
<P>
"The charter has two main objectives. The first is to raise
awareness of the extent to which sexual and reproductive rights
have already been recognized as human rights by the international
community. The other is to make clear the connection between these
human rights and the lives of men, women and children whose needs
in these areas are still unrecognized, " she said.
</P>
<P>
Of particular relevance to the Beijing Platform of Action was
the charter's special section on the right to equality, and to
freedom from all forms of discrimination, she said.
</P>
<P>
Brueggemann said that she hoped the charter "will help to
transform rights into realities" for the women and men whose
sexual and reproductive health and rights were denied.
</P>
<P>
The charter has been adopted by the 127 members of the
federation.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Pulp Makers Plan Price Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Several major Canadian pulp
producers, seeing improvements in paper markets worldwide, have
told their customers to expect a price increase of 40 to 50
U.S. dollars a ton from October 1.
</P>
<P>
The Vancouver-based Harmac Pacific Inc. plans to raise its
price for northern bleached softwood kraft pulp to 630 dollars
worldwide, from the current 580 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Another Vancouver company, Canfor Corp., told its customers
Wednesday that the price of its pulp would jump by 40 dollars, to
620 dollars a ton on October 1.
</P>
<P>
Other producers are also scheduling similar increases,
according to today's Globe and Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Pulp makers have had a dismal first half year watching prices
plummet by almost 50 percent from last fall's peak of 1,000
dollars a ton. Many reported financial losses for the first and
second quarters.
</P>
<P>
Inventories at Canadian mills skyrocketed to levels not seen
this decade, and major producers shut down production for weeks at
a time.
</P>
<P>
The shutdowns were continuing, and would probably last even
after October 1 if producers hoped to make the latest price
increases stick, the newspaper quoted an expert as saying.
</P>
<P>
Inventories around the world still remain high. Total supplies
on hand in North America and Scandinavia increased in July by
170,000 tons to about 1.7 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Producers needed to get that figure down to 1.2 million tons to
be able to push through strong prices increases, the analyst said.
</P>
<P>
However, pulp producers have been mostly successful in raising
prices worldwide over the summer, to 580 dollars in the United
States in July, to 550 dollars in northern Europe and to 560
dollars in Japan and South Korea, with a further tick upward in
offshore markets in August.

<HEADLINE> France to Continue Joining Allied Patrol in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- France today agreed to continue
to join the allied patrol over the two No Fly Zones in northern
and southern Iraq, after French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette
and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher had a meeting here.
</P>
<P>
The decision will take effect on September 9, said the French
Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Christopher had a brief meeting with President
Jacques Chirac and left the Elysee Presidential Office without
making any declaration.
</P>
<P>
De Charette first refused to release the result of his talks
with Christopher after the two held a three-hour meeting this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Before arriving here, Christopher said today in London that he
hoped that France would continue to cooperate with the United
States "as in the past".
</P>
<P>
France has expressed serious reservation over the U.S. missile
raids on Iraq in the past two days, but did not comment on the
U.S. decision to extend the exclusion zone in southern Iraq to
33rd north parallel, or 50 kilometers from Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear so far whether French combat aircraft will
enter the extended area after resuming patrol missions.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government has declared that it no longer recognizes
the two exclusion zones, set up by the United States, Britain and
France after the Gulf War in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Precious Chinese Archives Scattered Abroad In Large Numbers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- A large number of precious
Chinese archives have been lossed or taken overseas throughout
China's history, said Xu Yipu, director of the First Historical
Archives of China, who spoke at the ongoing 13th International
Congress on Archives in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Yin Ruins, the Dunhuang Buddhist Classics, and the Archives
of the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing Dynasties (1644-1911) are three
major cultural discoveries in modern Chinese history, but many of
these valuable relics were taken by foreign powers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Inscriptions on tortoise shells and animal bones found in the
Yin Ruins of the Shang Dynasty (16th century-11th century BC)
are symbols of ancient Chinese civilization, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China is in possession of about 128,000
inscriptive pieces of the total 150,000 that have been
unearthed. The others were extorted by foreign powers, such as
Japan, Canada, Britain, and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Dunhuang Buddhist Classics, written between the fourth and
11th century, were stored undetected for nearly 1,000 years. After
they were discovered early in this century, plunders from Western
countries made off with large numbers of the treasures.
</P>
<P>
As many as 6,000 volumes of these classics are in the Museum of
Great Britain, and 2,500 are in the National Library of France in
Paris. Some are still missing.
</P>
<P>
In 1900, the Eight-Power Allied Forces sent by Britain, the
United States, France, Russia, Japan, Germany, Italy and Austria,
captured the Chinese capital and plundered all of the archives
that had been preserved by the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) for more
than 200 years.
</P>
<P>
Many of them are still on exhibit in the Congressional Library
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The criminal activities inflicted by foreign powers on the
Chinese ancient civilization are unforgivable. It is also an
unprecedented barbaric cultural destruction of mankind's history,"
said Sun Dajiang, an archives expert.
</P>
<P>
To date, China has more than 170 million volumes of archives,
but the figure accounts for a small part of the total Chinese
historical archives, the expert said.

<HEADLINE> EU Differs over American Military Actions against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Irish Foreign Minister Dick
Spring has acknowledged that there are "very different views"
among the European Union (EU) member states over America's missile
attacks upon Iraq, according to press reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with Irish Radio earlier today,
Spring, whose country is holding the six-month rotating EU
presidency, said that "there are very different views" over
Washington's attacks on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the EU has postponed issuing a joint
statement on the U.S. military action against Iraq, underlining
the division in Europe over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Britain has reportedly pushed for a strong statement of support
for the U.S. action, but others, notably France argued that such a
statement should come from EU foreign ministers rather than from
the normal committee of political officials.
</P>
<P>
France, which has refused to join the United States and Britain
in policing an expanded no-fly zone over southern Iraq, said that
the UN Security Council must reaffirm Iraq's sovereignty and
territorial integrity in any resolution concerning Iraq's
offensive in the Kurdish area of northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Spring noted that EU reaction to U.S. raids upon Iraq would be
discussed at an informal meeting of EU foreign ministers, which is
due to be held at Tralee, Ireland over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
"We will have an opportunity of discussing that at the weekend
in Tralee and I am looking forward to that discussion," Spring
said. but he denied that EU states had "agreed to disagree" about
their views on the issue.

<HEADLINE> UK Business Warn Major Not to Rule out EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- A group of Britain's largest
companies today warn the Prime Minister John Major not to give in
to pressure form Tory Euro-sceptics to rule out participation in
European Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Financial Times newspaper, which is published
today, the chairmen and chief executives of 15 companies say that
outright rejection of a single currency would be "deeply damaging"
to jobs and export prospects.
</P>
<P>
The warning is the most significant indication yet of the
concern in industry over the growing pressure from within the
cabinet and the Tory party for Major to go into the next election
on a Euro-sceptic platform.
</P>
<P>
It closely follows a campaign by senior City figures to
persuade the government that London's position as the financial
centre of Europe would be jeopardized if Britain were left out of
a single currency.
</P>
<P>
The companies boasting "billions of dollars of export business
and creating tens of thousands of jobs in Britain" are led by
British Petroleum, the oil company, and Unilever, the consumer
products group.
</P>
<P>
They say that with so many aspects of proposed monetary union
unresolved as the official 1999 deadline approaches, "leaving an
empty chair at the table would mean that British interests would
be unrepresented as crucial decisions were taken."
</P>
<P>
Such a move would leave British firms "at a competitive
disadvantage for years to come" and would be interpreted by
investors in UK as "the first act in a process of disengagement
from one of the largest markets in the world", the letter says.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Treasury was sent a copy of the letter
and Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor, and Michael Heseltine, the
Deputy Prime Minister, will be delighted at the companies' stand.
</P>
<P>
They have been fighting an increasingly difficult battle to
keep open the UK's option.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the intervention of such senior
industrialists is likely to exacerbate divisions among the Tories
as next month's party conference approaches.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Europe's biggest Casino, built
by the Hyatt Regency hotel group, formally opened this evening in
Salonika, turning this northern Greek city into a Balkan gambling
Mecca.
</P>
<P>
The glittering gambling temple, built at a cost of 8.5 billion
drachmas (37 million U.S. dollars) is part of the Greek
government's efforts to boost its revenues, encourage regional
development, and stop the rich people from flocking across the
border to Casinos in neighboring Bulgaria and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
The Casino employs a staff of 1,200 people, mainly young
locals who underwent rigid training in Roulette, black jack, Punto
Banco, Carribean-style poker and other gambling delights.
</P>
<P>
The Greek state will reap 30 percent of the profits from an
estimated revenue of 15 billion drachmas (about 65 million U.S.
dollars) from the operation of the Casino.

<HEADLINE> U.S. CIA Head Says Iraqi Troops Pulling Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) Director John Deutch said today that Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein is pulling back troops and tanks from the Arbil
region in northern Iraq despite press reports of escalation of
military preparations in the region.
</P>
<P>
Deutch made the remarks during a testimony on other issues
before the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee.
</P>
<P>
The CIA head said that following U.S. missile strikes against
selected targets in Iraq in the past few days, Iraq's "mobilized
and tank units are withdrawing from Arbil and northern Kurdish"
areas.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the U.S. Central Command, headquarters
responsible for the Gulf region, also said earlier in the day that
they were seeing the Iraqi president removing his troops from
northern Kurdish areas.
</P>
<P>
But local news reports quoting Kurdish faction leaders as
saying that Iraq's forces were again preparing to move against

<HEADLINE> Turkish Minister: US Attack on Iraq Violates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Justice Minister
Sevket Kazan said today that the U.S. air strikes against Iraq
have violated international law and hurt the relations between
Turkey and Iraq, according to the semi-official Anatolia News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Kazan, who is also a leading member of the pro-Islamic Welfare
Party (RP), said in Bursa, western Turkey, that "a country has no
right to do this before a resolution is adopted by the United
Nations Security Council."
</P>
<P>
This is the first Turkish official response criticizing the
United States for its military operations against the selected air
defense targets in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkey strongly supported the U.S.-led coalition forces to oust
Iraq from Kuwait during the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. air forces launched two rounds of cruise missile
attacks against Iraq in 24 hours starting from early Tuesday
morning, killing six people and wounding 36 others. The
U.S. claimed that the strikes were in retaliation for Iraqi
troops' weekend attacks on the Kurdish-controlled city of Irbil in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
At midnight Wednesday, the General Command of the Iraqi
Armed Forces confirmed that Iraq had suffered the third round of
missile attacks launched by the U.S. forces, which came several
hours after the Iraqi anti-aircraft guns opened fire on hostile
targets in the dark skies over Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
On August 12, Kazan and Turkish Education Minister Mehmet
Saglam met with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in Baghdad and
held talks with Iraqi officials on means of boosting bilateral
relations in the commercial, economic and political fields after Iraq
signed with the U.N. an oil-for-food deal in May.
</P>
<P>
Turkey claimed that it has lost a total of 30 billion U.S.
dollars since the imposition of the U.N. trade embargo on Iraq
six years ago.

ANKARA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today asked the

Turkish sources here said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Undersecretary of the Turkish Foreign

the closure of the petrol pipelines following the 1990 Gulf War
hurt the Turkish economy.

Oymen attached great importance to the immediate flow of oil

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 5 (Xinhua) --U.S. President Bill Clinton
is concerned about reported heart problems of Russian President
Boris Yeltsin and the U.S. Embassy in Moscow has been instructed
to seek further details, a spokesman for the White House said
today.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, speaking slowly in a television interview, told
Russians earlier in the day that he had agreed to undergo heart
surgery, probably at the end of the month in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
"The president (Clinton) is obviously concerned to hear about
President Yeltsin's health," White House spokesman Mike McCurry
told reporters aboard Air Force One. He was accompanying Clinton
in a two-day presidential election campaign trip to Florida.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any official information from our embassy yet,"
the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
He said that Clinton "certainly wishes him all the best for a
full and speedy recovery."
</P>
<P>
A Kremlin source told reporters that Yeltsin's operation was
likely to be bypass surgery, in which artificial tubes are
inserted to replace clogged arteries to improve blood supply to
the heart.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin had two heart attacks last year. He disappeared from
Russian public view on June 26. His aids first denied that the
president was ill, saying only that Yeltsin was exhausted after a
grueling election campaign.

<HEADLINE> Dole Calls Postponement of Bosnia Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican
presidential nominee Bob Dole today repeated his call for
President Bill Clinton to postpone general elections in the
war-torn former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"These elections make a mockery of our principles and
commitment to democracy," Dole said in a campaign speech at
Dayton, Ohio, where the United States brokered the Bosnian peace
accord last November.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal after human rights workers say that the
voter registration process in Bosnia was plagued by abuse and
nationalist authorities have stifled free speech and free
movement.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian voting for president and several legislative
chambers is run by the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe. The elections, scheduled to be held on September 14,
are designed to reunify the ethnically divided country.
</P>
<P>
Dole, former U.S. Senate majority leader, wrote to Clinton last
week, asking the president to help postpone the planned elections
in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"There is still time for the president to postpone these
elections. Many Americans, regardless of party, think it's a big
mistake to pursue what would in effect be shame elections," Dole
told his supporters in Dayton, a U.S. midwestern industrial city.
</P>
<P>
But the Clinton government has insisted that Bosnian elections
should be held as planned so that the nearly 20,000 American peace
implementation troops could be pulled out from the Balkan nation
at the end of the year.

PARIS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. State Department official
said here today that the Western coalition against Iraq is always
in good shape and remains "intact" after the U.S. launched
missile raids on Iraq this week.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made by U.S. State Department spokesman
Nicholas Burns at the end of a visit by U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher in the French capital today.
</P>
<P>
France agreed today to continue its participation in the
"Southern Watch" and "Provide Comfort" operations led by the
United States and Britain to supervise two No Fly Zones in
northern and southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On the unilateral decision by the United States to extend the
exclusion zone in southern Iraq to 33rd parallel, Burns said that
it is up to the French government to decide whether it will
observe it or not.
</P>
<P>
"The United States and Britain are capable of putting into
work the decision of extending this exclusion zone," he said.

A French Foreign Ministry communique said that French combat
aircraft will not cross the 32nd parallel.

<HEADLINE> British Diplomat Found Guilty in Smuggling Sex Videos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- A British diplomat was found
guilty today of smuggling more than 100 videos of child
pornography from Japan.
</P>
<P>
Robert Coghlan, 54, who spent 30 years in British Embassies
abroad, was caught when his possessions were routed from Tokyo,
where he was first secretary, to his new posting in Madrid, via
London.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat did not deny that the l09 videos are obscene and
was convicted by a jury at London's Southwark Crown Court. He will
be sentenced on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nigel Lithman, prosecutor, claimed Coghlan had deliberately
tried to conceal the presence of his illegal collection at a time
when he knew his belongings were first being sent to Britain.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat was arrested last March. Lithman said Coghlan had
admitted that many of the "homosexual pornography" videos had been
bought in Japan, but he insisted he was not interested in
"watching young kids".
</P>
<P>
Coghlan is believed to be the first British diplomat to be
found guilty of smuggling pornographic material.
</P>
<P>
The jurors looked shocked as they watched the paedophile
activities on screens in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
Lithman said: "It would seem that in Japan he had something of
a dual existence, that he was something of a Jekyll and Hyde
character -- sometimes a respectable representative of the
country, at other times visiting specialist sex shops, buying the
most profane type of paedophile material, until he had accumulated
this large collection."
</P>
<P>
Judge Gerald Butler QC remanded the suspended senior diplomat
in custody overnight pending sentence tomorrow.

for the Democrats for the first time since the 1970s, U.S.
President Bill Clinton opened a campaign sprint across Florida
Thursday with promises of further efforts in education.
</P>
<P>
"I want a country where every 8-year-old can read, every
12-year-old can hook into the Internet and every 18-year-old can
go to college," media reports quoted Clinton as saying at a rally
on a high school lawn in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
"I want you to support me in trying to build a bridge to the
21st century where every child in America has the best educational
opportunity in the world," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Much has been achieved in his administration, Clinton said,
"but I want to be president for four more years because there are
some other things we need to do in education."
</P>
<P>
Polls showed Clinton running neck and neck with his Republican
rival Robert Dole in Florida.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was expected to turn next to the health care issue in
the state that has the fastest growing retirement in the country.

<HEADLINE> Canada TV Channels to Grow by 23 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian federal broadcast
regulator has granted 23 new TV specialty channel licenses,
covering everything from gardening and history to sports and
animation.
</P>
<P>
Four of the new channels were given priority access to the
available cable channels. They are expected to be launched in
about a year from now.
</P>
<P>
The other channels will have to wait until channel capacity
increases with the arrival of digital distribution, according to
local media reports today.
</P>
<P>
Digital distribution will begin when direct-to-home satellite
television is launched in Canada, and when the cable industry
introduces new digital video compression boxes, promised now for
late this year.
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, the Canadian Radio-television and
Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) has approved the creation of
43 specialty channels and 11 pay-TV channels.
</P>
<P>
The last time CRTC dished out licenses, it granted just 6
specialty channels. This time, the regulator gave the nod to many
more, partly because of industry pressure, and partly due to the
consideration that if Canadian channels aren't developed quickly,
American channels will come in.
</P>
<P>
A recent official report shows that in 1995 Canadians watched
an average of half an hour more television a day than in 1994, the
first viewing increase in many years.

<HEADLINE> NY City Schools Open to Worst Crowding in Decades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Classrooms were crammed into
oversized closets, cordoned off in auditoriums and plunked into
locker rooms.
</P>
<P>
This scenario was given by the New York Times today which
carried a lengthy article reporting the opening of classes across
New York City.
</P>
<P>
The city schools opened Wednesday to the worst overcrowding in
decades with signs of strain and confusion, just from the overflow
of students, 91,000 more than the school system can accommodate,
the article said.
</P>
<P>
More than 500,000 students in the city's high schools and
junior highs showed up, mostly to register, and today, elementary
school students begin classes. Lines of students trying to
register stretched for blocks. Some schools had so many new
students trying to sign up that they had to turn away applicants
for the day, saying that they could not find time to evaluate and
register everyone.
</P>
<P>
This year, 20,000 new students enrolled in the system, bringing
the total of students to 1.06 million, which left the system
almost 10 percent over capacity, forcing the largest classes to
grow as many as 45. The maximum under the teachers contract is 34.
</P>
<P>
The city's teachers union Wednesday threatened to pull its
members out of schools where overcrowded conditions posed a danger
to teachers or students.
</P>
<P>
The overcrowding is attributable to a combination of factors:
immigration flooding into the system, the effects of a miniature
baby boom, fewer students dropping out and the failure to build
new classrooms in time to accommodate the overflow.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it has also been fueled by budget constraints. The
Board of Education has predicted that by 2004, the school system
would need construct enough spaces for 300,000 students. But the
board's current five-year plan has enough money to build space
only for 30,000 students.

</P>
<P>
ICBC is the leading state-owned commercial bank in China and is
ranked among the top 10 largest banks in the world in terms of

<HEADLINE> French Government Suspends Sale of "Mad Cow" Cosmetics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- French government today decided
to suspend the sale of cosmetics products containing essences of
the eye, brain and marrow of cows and sheep likely to be infected
with the "mad cow" disease.
</P>
<P>
However, the ordinance will seriously affect the local
cosmetics market, because French cosmetics producers have been
observing a government recommendation of not to use possible "mad
cow" cattle essences from Britain since November 1992, said the
State Secretariat of Health.
</P>
<P>
The ordinance said that cosmetics producers containing eye,
brain and marrow essences of cows older than six months, and sheep
and goat more than one year old cannot be sold.
</P>
<P>
Eye, brain and marrow are considered to be the easiest parts of
cattle to be infected with the "mad cow" disease virus.
</P>
<P>
The ordinance also bans the sale of cosmetics and body hygiene
products containing essences of cattle slaughtered in Britain, no
matter what age the slaughtered cattle are.

<P>
ANKARA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Despite denials from the
military sources here, heavy military preparations are reportedly
underway on the Turkish borders with Iraq today.
</P>
<P>
A massive cross-border military operation is believed to be
launched on the bases of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK)
in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
This evening, Turkish Justice Minister Sevket Kazan said in
Bursa, western Turkey, that Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan held
 a secret meeting with senior Iraqi diplomats at the prime
minister's residence at Ayranci District of Ankara to give the
Iraqis the information on the pending Turkish military operations
in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkish sources said that Turkey is seriously considering to
set up a security belt zone, up to 10 kilometers deep into the
Iraqi side of the border, to prevent PKK infiltrations into the
Turkish territory.
</P>
<P>
President Suleyman Demirel met with Chief of General Staff Ismail
Hakki Karadayi and Interior Minister Mehmet Agar this evening
amid reports of the military preparation and plans to set
up the security zone in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu
Ciller said Wednesday that the PKK was amassing forces on the
border with Turkey.

<HEADLINE> More Canadian Retirees Return to Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- More Canadian retirees return
to work, especially among managers and professionals, according to
the latest report by Canada Statistics.
</P>
<P>
About 13 percent of retired Canadians surveyed in 1994 said
they had returned to work.
</P>
<P>
On average, they returned to the world of work within 18 months
after leaving it.
</P>
<P>
About 25 percent of the retirees said they went back to work
for financial reasons. The rest said they preferred to work and
wanted to occupy free time.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of retirees who return to work generally
decreases with age, with 8 percent of those aged 70 and older
working and 38 percent of retirees under 55.
</P>
<P>
In addition, people with a university education were more
likely to return to work after retirement.
</P>
<P>
Retired managers and professionals had a higher rate of return
to paid employment than retirees from clerical, sales and service
jobs, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
There is also a link between type of employment and retirement
age. People with a contract or part-time job retired later than
those with a standard job. Self-employed Canadians retired later
than employees, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Most Frenchmen Want Economic Policy Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Eighty-three percent of
Frenchmen want a change of the country's economic policy and 51
percent think it is no good to maintain a strong franc at any
price, according to a latest poll by the Liberation daily.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-three percent of Frenchmen think that it is possible to
put into place a different economic policy, while 59 percent say
that a lowering of social charges on salary owners will help
improve the economy.
</P>
<P>
One among two reached by the poll said that a lowering of taxes
will push the economy forward and 46 percent say that cutting
taxes will stimulate consumption.
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted by the IFOP polling institute for
Liberation on August 29-30 among 943 people chosen from different
regions and social walks.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Alain Juppe announced today that the
government will cut income tax by 25 billion francs (5 billion
U.S. dollars) in 1997 and by 75 billion francs (15 billion U.S.
dollars) in five years.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Down to 5.1 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. unemployment rate
declined to 5.1 percent in August, the lowest level in seven
years, the Labor Department announced today.
</P>
<P>
It was a steep drop from the 5.4 percent rate in July and the
lowest since it reached five percent in March 1989.
</P>
<P>
A survey of employers showed a gain of 250,000 jobs in August,
following an increase of 228,000 in July, which was revised up
from 193,000 initially reported last month.
</P>
<P>
Much of the job creation, 77,000, came in government jobs and
most of that in education, the Department said.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing jobs rose by 25,000 after declining in June and
July. Payrolls grew by 21,000 in retail trade, 21,000 in finance,
insurance and real estate, but by only 6,000 in construction.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the average hourly earnings of non-farm,
non-supervisory workers went up to 11.87 dollars in August, a six
cent increase following a two cent drop in July.
</P>
<P>
The labor report was almost sure to rile financial markets,
which were watching anxiously for signs of an overly strong
economy that could cause the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) to boost
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Before today's report, economists were split over whether the
Fed would nudge rates higher before the Nov. 5 election, or wait
to see if economic momentum slowed a bit. The report was expected
to increase the likelihood that monetary policy-makers would act
by their next scheduled meeting on September 24.
</P>
<P>
The strong job market since early this year has pleased
President Bill Clinton who is running for the second term. The
U.S. government said that job growth during Clinton's term had
been nearly double the 129,000 jobs created monthly during George
Bush's four years in office.

<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Olympic silver medalist China
scored an easy 3-0 victory over the Netherlands in the second leg
of the women's volleyball Grand Prix preliminaries here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Spiker Wu Yongmei scored 12 points, captain Lai Yawen added
five and ace hitter Sun Yue had four to inspire China to the 15-2,
15-5 and 15-7 win against the European champion, a repeat of the
3-0 win in an Atlanta Olympic Games group match.
</P>
<P>
"Today we played the best match in this year's grand prix,"
Chinese head coach Lang Ping said. "We had prepared for the match
very well."
</P>
<P>
Dutch coach Bert Goedkoop said: "This was the worst game my
team had ever played in two years. The younger players failed to
stay calm and I'm not satisfied with their performance."
</P>
<P>
Erna Brinkman scored four points to lead the Dutch players.
</P>
<P>
In another match on Friday, Olympic champion Cuba rallied from
10-14 down in the first set to win 16-14 against the resilient
South Korea and took the following sets 15-12 and 15-3.
</P>
<P>
Veteran Regla Torres led Cuban scorers with 13 points, followed
by Marleny Costa and Ana Fernandez both at seven.
</P>
<P>
Ku Min-jung had nine points for South Korea and Chang So-yun
added five.
</P>
<P>
Cuba's coach Antonio Perdomo said: "Without three Olympians, I
am contented with the results. We had problems with service and
receiving in the first set."
</P>
<P>
South Korean coach Kim Cheol-yong attributed the loss to his
players' shorter statures.
</P>
<P>
"Our players are shorter and blocking become a big problem,"
Kim said.

China faces South Korea and Cuba meets the Netherlands on

respect the Chinese government's principled position on the Taiwan
issue.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Shen Guofang, told the press today the Chinese
government has made serious representations with the Indonesian
government over its permitting Chang Shiao-yen, "foreign minister"
of the Taiwan authorities, to visit Indonesia and arranging his
meetings with high-level Indonesian officials.

<HEADLINE> China Wants Long-Term Cooperation with Poland, Li Ruihuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese leader Li Ruihuan said
here today that it is China's policy to develop long-term
cooperation with Poland on the basis of mutual respect, equality,
mutual benefits and non-interference in each other's internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), made the remarks during
his meeting with Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is on a trip to Poland, said that exchange of visits at
high levels played a unique role in pushing forward the
development of relations between China and Poland.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski said that Poland and China enjoyed a sound
relationship and the Polish government always attached great
importance to relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Poland hoped to enhance cooperation with China in the fields of
politics, economy, science and culture, the Polish president said.
</P>
<P>
In a separate meeting with Polish Prime Minister Wlodzimierz
Cimoszewicz, Li said trade and economic ties were a major
foundation for the overall bilateral relationship and that
potentials for trade and economic cooperation between the two
countries were yet to be tapped.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between China and Poland increased annually in
recent years and the prospects for further economic and trade
cooperation were promising, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that governments of the two countries should encourage
more business contacts and help businessmen gain a bigger share in
each other's markets through improving quality, quoting reasonable
prices and providing better services.
</P>
<P>
Cimoszewicz said that China had made great economic
achievements and Poland had also made new progress in economic
construction.
</P>
<P>
He said this had laid a solid foundation for closer trade
and economic cooperation between Poland and China.
</P>
<P>
The Polish prime minister said he believed the two countries
would become the most important trade partner to each other through
concerted efforts.

OTTAWA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Canada's employment increase in
August has reduced the jobless rate 0.4 percentage points to 9.4
percent, Statistics Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
The federal fact-gathering agency estimated there were 82,000
more jobs in August compared with the previous month, more than
offsetting job losses observed in June, when the jobless rate hit
10 percent.

<P>
Prior to June, the country's unemployment rate hovered steadily
in the 9.4 percent range.
</P>
<P>
In the province of Quebec, employment increased by 41,000 in
August, partially offsetting the estimated 76,000 job loss
observed in June and July.
</P>
<P>
In Ontario Province, employment rose by 51,000 following a
31,000 increase in July, bringing year-over-year gains to 144,000.
</P>
<P>
Employment in August fell by 11,000 in both Alberta and British
Columbia. And all four Atlantic provinces showed little change in
employment in August, the agency said.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto said here today he has no immediate plans to dissolve
the Diet's House of Representatives and call for a general
election before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said he had no such plans for the time being because,
"I must deal with such pending issues as Okinawa and economic
recovery."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said he had told his predecessor, Tomiichi
Murayama, who heads the Social Democratic party (SDP), of his
position.
</P>
<P>
The SDP is part of the tripartite ruling coalition which also
involves Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and New Party
Sakigake.
</P>
<P>
Major Japanese dailies, citing coalition sources, reported in
their morning editions today that Hashimoto was considering
dissolving the lower house and calling a general election in
October or early November.
</P>
<P>
They said Hashimoto had obviously taken into consideration
growing pressure within his LDP for an early dissolution of the
lower house as the present chamber had been in place for more than
three years following the previous general election.

<HEADLINE> British Gurkha Squadron Disbands in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The 67 Gurkha Independent
Field Squadron, British Gurkha Engineers stationed in Hong Kong,
disbanded here this evening after they staged their last parade
ceremony at Sek Kong.
</P>
<P>
It is one part of the final-stage withdrawal of the British
Garrison in Hong Kong, which started from August 30.
</P>
<P>
The squadron first served in Hong Kong between 1962 and 1966,
and it returned to the territory from Malaysia in 1970.
</P>
<P>
As the only remaining engineer unit with the British Forces in
Hong Kong, the 120 member squadron mainly provided engineering
support for the British Garrison in Hong Kong since the
disbandment of Gurkha Engineer Regiment in 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release from the news service of the
British Garrison in Hong Kong, half of the squadron will remain in
the British Army and are set to return to Britain to join 69
Gurkha Squadron with 36 Engineer Regiment in Maidstone.
</P>
<P>
Of the remainder, three will be transferred to the Royal Gurkha
Rifles while 62 men will leave the Squadron. Some of them have
applied to join the Gurkha Reserve Unit in Brunei, some will take
up jobs in Hong Kong and the rest will return to Nepal to start
their own business.
</P>
<P>
On August 29, Major General Bryan Dutton, commander of the
British Forces in Hong Kong, announced the current withdrawal of
the British Garrison which will last until June 30, 1997 when
China resumes its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
There are now 3,250 personnel in the British Garrison, which
consists of about 2,600 military personnel and 650 civilians.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Ruling Party Bags Most Seats in Bypolls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's ruling Awami League
(AL) has won most of the parliamentary seats in Thursday's
by-elections in 15 constituencies, the Election Commission said in
an unofficial statement on the initial results today.
</P>
<P>
The by-elections were held to fill up the 15 parliamentary
seats vacated by senior leaders of several political parties who
had won in more than one constituency in the country's seventh
parliamentary elections on June 12.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the AL won eight seats in the
bypolls while the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)
bagged three seats, the Jatiya (National) Party (JP) won two seats
and an independent candidate got one seat.
</P>
<P>
The result of the bypolls in the Rangpur constituency in the
northwest of the country has yet to be announced as polling in one
center was postponed due to "ballot stuffing," said the
commission.
</P>
<P>
Chief Election Commissioner Mohammad Abu Hena said the bypolls
were free, fair and transparent. Reports said that except for
sporadic incidents in some polling centers, the polling was held
peacefully with a high turnout.
</P>
<P>
However, the BNP alleged massive rigging and widespread
violence by the ruling party in the by-elections.
</P>
<P>
According to one BNP official, the by-elections were marked by
incidents like booth capturing, driving out of BNP polling agents,
stuffing of ballot papers and intimidation of voters. He added
that at many places women voters were threatened with acid
throwing.

<HEADLINE> Lebed Discusses Chechen Settlement with Yeltsin's Chief Aide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian security chief
Alexander Lebed met the Presidential Office Director, Anatoly
Chubais, here this morning to discuss the Chechen settlement, the
presidential press service said.
</P>
<P>
It gave no details of the meeting which took place soon after
Lebed returned from a Chechen trip.
</P>
<P>
The press service only said that Lebed and Chubais met for two-
and-a-half hours to "discuss a wide range of issues, including the
process of the settlement of the crisis in the Chechen republic."
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Lebed and Chechen rebel leaders agreed on a
coalition government in Chechnya, demilitarization of the Chechen
capital of Grozny and exchange of war prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin broke his long silence on the
peace deals for Chechnya signed by his special envoy
Lebed. Yeltsin gave Lebed his overall support but criticized him
for being too hasty in withdrawing Russian troops from the
breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
"I support his action, and I have backed the latest plan of
action with the exception of one issue -- the fast and prompt
withdrawal of troops. I think we should not be in a hurry to do
that. The rest I have backed and fully approved," Yeltsin said in
a television interview.
</P>
<P>
It was the first direct comment Yeltsin had made on the Chechen
agreement, signed on August 31 by Lebed, secretary of the Russian
Security Council, and Chechen rebel military chief of staff Aslan
Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
The agreement made a compromise on the core issue of the
Chechen conflict -- the political status of Chechnya -- by putting
off a decision for five years.
</P>
<P>
Lebed is expected today to meet Chechen pro-Moscow leader Doku
Zavgayev, who stated earlier that he was not going to resign
because that would not help establish a lasting peace in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Zavgayev, who spends most of his time in Moscow since the
Chechen rebels stormed into Grozny early in August, said he had
agreed to meet with Lebed.

<HEADLINE> New Railway Line Under Construction in Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today
announced that construction has begun on another part of a key
railway line in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The railway line begins in the city of Turpan and ends in
Kashi, extending a total length of 1,470 km in southern Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
The 975-km stretch to be constructed is the western part of the
railway line and will link Korla and Kashi. It is expected to be
completed in three and a half years.
</P>
<P>
The eastern part of the line, between Turpan and Korla,
covering 495 km, opened in 1984. It plays a vital role in
exploiting petroleum and gas resources in the Tarim Basin, and
boosting economic growth in southern Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
The premier said at a ceremony in Korla that the construction
of the new rail line is a key move by the State Council to step up
economic and social development in Xinjiang and narrow the gap
between the eastern and western parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the state has increased investment in
infrastructure in Xinjiang, but the sector remains weak, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on all officials with the Ministry of Railways to
carefully plan the railway's construction, in order to contribute
more to economic expansion of resource-abundant Xinjiang.

<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The first conference of the
21st Century Forum, sponsored by the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, ended here
today and was hailed as a success.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time the CPPCC has invited renowned Chinese
and foreign statesman, experts and scholars to engage in detailed
discussions over a number of major international issues.
</P>
<P>
It proved to be positive, beneficial and fruitful, according to
participants.
</P>
<P>
More than distinguished 50 guests and speakers analyzed Asia's
general economic and political trends in the 21st century,
focussing mainly on China after the year 2000. They were open,
enthusiastic and cordial in their exchange of views.
</P>
<P>
It was a widely-held belief at the conference that the prospect
for Asia's economic growth is promising, and the current rapid
growth trend in Asia, especially in the east and southeast Asia
areas, will continue at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Reform is taking off in south Asia, and great potential for
middle and west Asia cannot be neglected, many participants agreed.
</P>
<P>
They said the new economic development trend in Asia was
characterized by intensive effort, integration and globalization.
</P>
<P>
Many Asian countries that need economic restructuring and
adjustment of economic growth approaches are switching from an
extensive mode to one that is intensive, they noted.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out the Asian economies are becoming more
integrated, a trend that is a natural outcome of economic
development in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Asian economy has at the same time become an important
component of the world economy, they said, and the development in
Asia will help push forward the world economy.
</P>
<P>
However, attention was also drawn to challenges facing the
economic growth in Asia, which include population growth,
inflation, inadequate infrastructure, weak scientific and
technological strength and resource constraints.
</P>
<P>
These and other problems that may crop up during the course of
economic development and transformation should be handled with
care and conscientiously overcome, they cautioned.
</P>
<P>
The participants also exchanged views on the issues concerning
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The political situation and security in Asia was a
pre-occupation at the conference, with many participants believing
that the comparatively stable political situation -- a prominent
feature of the region -- is likely to be sustained.
</P>
<P>
They attributed this to the unique conditions that Asia
possesses: multi-polarization, which started early in the region
and continued to develop; and diversity, which makes it difficult
for Asian countries to form antagonizing military blocs.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the Cold War, the security cooperation in Asia
has become increasingly more active. Security dialogue, political
consultations, military exchanges and confidence-building measures
have been carried out through different channels, in different
forms and at different levels.
</P>
<P>
However, they noted, some destabilizing elements do exist,
which were also discussed at the forum.
</P>
<P>
The participants praised China's enduring rapid economic
development, saying China will achieve still more advances in this
area, and play an even greater role in international affairs in
the next century, as long as it maintains political stability and
remains on the steady course it set out to follow.
</P>
<P>
A number of speakers repudiated the so-called "China threat."
They held that China has the ability to demonstrate that a
prosperous China is better for the world than an impoverished and
unstable nation.
</P>
<P>
They also reach consensus that the economic growth of China and
other areas in East Asia offers more opportunities to the world
and helps to maintain the balance of the global economy.

<HEADLINE> Amal-Hezbollah Coalition to Run for Lebanon's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Nabih Berri, leader of the
Lebanese pro-Syrian Amal Movement, announced in his southern
Lebanese residence this afternoon a joint list of candidates of
his group and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah to run for the country's
general election.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made at a televized press conference held
in Berri's residence in Museileh after the two biggest Shiite
groups agreed to form a coalition to stand the forth of the
five-phased parliamentary election in southern Lebanon on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two rival groups reached the agreement only after Syria,
the main power broker in Lebanon, intensified its mediation
efforts and summoned Berri and Hezbollah's Secretary General
Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah to Damascus on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Many Lebanese sighed with relief when Amal and Hezbollah, both
have armed militias which are inclined to flex their muscles,
reached the agreement as a result of the mediations made by senior
Syrian officials, particularly Vice President Abdel Halim Khaddam.
</P>
<P>
Local political observers believed that the Amal-Hezbollah
coalition was dictated by "the regional circumstance," including
the continuous Israeli occupation in southern Lebanon, Israel's
increasing threat of military action against this country and the
deadlocked peace process.
</P>
<P>
Berri said that all the candidates on the list of "Liberation
and Development" represented all the citizens in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said that they were representing the Amal, Hezbollah, the
Arab Baath Socialist Party, the Progressive Socialist Party, the
National Social Party and all other national forces in the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
"All the candidates on the list are committed to Lebanon, to
God, to a national unity and to a common life," the Amal leader
stressed.
</P>
<P>
However, he called on supporters of the groups in the
coalition to vote for all the candidates on the list and warned
them not to resort to crossing off any names in the polling, a
tactic prevalently used in the previous rounds of election.
</P>
<P>
There are some 120 candidates to compete for the 23
parliamentary seats allocated for southern Lebanon, including 13
reserved for Shiite Moslems, four for Sunni Moslems, two for
Maronites, one for Greek Orthodox Christians, two for Greek
Catholic Christians, and one for Druzes.
</P>
<P>
On the Amal-Hezbollah joint list are 21 candidates, including
six members of Amal and four members of Hezbollah, while leaving
two slots vacant for two Sunni candidates from Saida, one could
very possibly be incumbent deputy Bahia Hariri, sister of Lebanese
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
</P>
<P>
Bahia has to stay outside of the Amal-Hezbollah coalition for
the Shiite fundamentalist Hezbollah, a main opposition force in
Lebanon, insisted on its refusal to stand the election side by
side with a Hariri.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
today agreed with the governments of Bosnia, Herzegovina, and the
self-styled Serb Republic on the implementation of the first
region-wide mine clearance program.
</P>
<P>
As part of its commitments to reconstruction in Bosnia and to
its wider campaign against the scourge of anti-personnel mines,
the EC will provide funding of more than six million ECU (some 7.8
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A communique issued here Friday said the money would cover
several proposed projects -- the first including the purchase of
mine clearance equipment for up to 20 mobile teams, along with
salaries for 240 local mine clearers.
</P>
<P>
The second project would create a rapid-response explosive
ordnance disposal unit, with 10 four-member teams trained for
emergency mine and bomb disposal tasks.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that for both projects, 70 percent of resources
would be devoted to Bosnia and Herzegovina, and 30 percent to the
"Serb Republic".
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Bosnia and Herzegovina are "polluted" by
up to three million mines. Sarajevo's Kosovo hospital admits a
seriously-injured victim every day on average.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-run Mine Action Center, partly funded from a
contribution of 3.6 million ECU (about 4.7 million dollars) from
the European Union, reports 100 mine casualties a month in the
region.

<P>
PARIS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- France will raise taxes on
alcohol and tobacco products and will use the extra money to
finance social security projects, said Minister of Economy and
Finances Jean Arthuis today.
</P>
<P>
Arthuis, who justified the decision by linking alcohol and
tobacco consumption to health problems, did not give the exact
figures of the increases, but said they would be "high".
</P>
<P>
He said that the government expected a 1.3 percent growth of
the gross national product in 1996, and a 2.3 percent growth in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The public deficit would be contained below 288 billion francs
(about 58 billion U.S. dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
The government announced Thursday evening that it would reduce
income and other taxes by 43 billion francs (8.6 billion dollars)
in 1997.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Visit Egypt on Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat is to visit Egypt Saturday to brief his Egyptian
counterpart Hosni Mubarak on his landmark meeting with Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Natanyahu.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Arafat met Netanyahu for the first time for a
brief summit on the Israeli-Gaza border to reactivate the stalled
peace process.
</P>
<P>
It was the first face-to-face meeting between the two leaders
since Netanyahu took office in June. Trying to keep a campaign
promise, he has long shunned Arafat, whom he accused of
"harboring terrorism."
</P>
<P>
The meeting helped ease Israeli-Palestinian tension growing
since Netanyahu's May election victory over former Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
In the summit, the two leaders agreed to a series of
lower-level talks during which key outstanding issues would be
discussed.
</P>
<P>
Among the issues on the agenda is Israel's desire to change
the terms of its promised pullout from the West Bank town of
Hebron to protect Jewish settlers there, and the Palestinians'
demand that Israel ease the six-month closure of their
territories.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference after the meeting,
Netanyahu said that the two leaders "reiterated the commitments
to the signed agreements and the determination to carry out the
implementation."
</P>
<P>
"However," he added. "I'd like to emphasize that we have to
take into account the needs and requirements on the basis of
reciprocity and ensuring of the security and wellbeing of both
Israelis and Palestinians alike."
</P>
<P>
Describing the meeting as "positive", Arafat praised Netanyahu
 for agreeing to hold the meeting that would increase mutual
cooperation to push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In Rome, Arafat said Thursday that the issue of Jerusalem
would either make or break the Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
"To insist on saying that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel
is a fact that is contrary to truth and reality, besides being a
violation of a (U.N.) resolution and international law," he added.
</P>
<P>
Israel has insisted on an undivided Jerusalem as its
capital. While the Palestinians have demanded the establishment
of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Arafat often comes to Egypt to confer with Mubarak on the
peace process. Egypt is the first Arab country to make peace with
Israel, and Mubarak has been active in mediating between the
Palestinians and Israelis.

<HEADLINE>   China Welcomes Help, But Not Interference: CPPCC Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese leader Li Ruihuan said
here today that China welcomes foreign help, suggestions and
criticism made with good-will, but opposes interference in its
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
China respects other countries' rights in deciding their own
internal affairs, and hopes other countries respect China's right
to do likewise, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), made the remarks this
morning at a meeting with Polish President Sleksander Kwasniewski.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the Chinese government always believed a country's
choice of social system and development were its internal
affairs, and allowed for no foreign interference.
</P>
<P>
Countries varied in cultural traditions, customs, religions and
economic conditions, Li said. Any attempt to force one's ideas
upon others was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Li said China believed that all countries would some day find a
development path suitable to their own conditions.
</P>
<P>
As the biggest developing country in the world, China had a
huge population, and faced a shortage of resources and a
regionally unbalanced development, Li said.
</P>
<P>
It was always a most arduous job for China to feed its 1.2
billion people, achieve sustained economic growth and maintain
long-term social stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is the Chinese who know China best. It is still the Chinese
who are most concerned with China's difficulties and problems", Li
said, China had chosen a socialist road with Chinese
characteristics after hard exploration, and this had been proven
to suit China's realities, and therefore was a success.
</P>
<P>
Li said China sincerely wanted to conduct exchanges and
cooperation with other countries and to learn from the experiences
of all peoples in the world.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski said that the Polish people always respected
Chinese culture which had a long history, and were pleased to see
China's achievements in its modernization drive.

<HEADLINE> Chinese General Meets With Former US Defense Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- General Zhang Wannian,
chairman of the Chinese Central Military Commission, said here
today that China will never pose a threat to any other country and
the so-called "China threat" is mere nonsense aimed at inflaming
its relations with neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with visiting former US defense secretary
James R. Schlesinger and his party, General Zhang described
China's defense policy as defensive, saying that its military
expenditure is low and the development of the weaponry by its army
is aimed soly to protect his country's state sovereignty and
territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Taiwan issue remains the key problem in
Sino-US relations, and hoped that the US would strictly observe
the principles set in the three Sino-US joint communiques, concern
itself with the overall situation instead of saving a little only
to lose a lot, and no longer cause trouble in regard to this issue.
</P>
<P>
To develop healthy and stable Sino-US relations not only
accords with the interests of the people of both nations, but is
also beneficial to the safeguarding of peace and stability of the
Asia-Pacific region and the world as a whole, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to work together with the US to increase trust,
reduce troubles, develop cooperation and eliminate confrontation
in a hope that the relations between the two countries and their
armies would keep developing and improving," he said.
</P>
<P>
James R. Schlesinger and his party are visiting China as guests
of the China Institute for International Strategic Studies.

HANOI, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has again turned down
requests by the United States to use its territory to broadcast
Free Asia Radio, says the Laotian official news agency KPL.
</P>
<P>
KPL quoted Tuang Mukdasiri, charge d'affairs of the Thai
embassy in Vietnam, as saying that Thailand would not let the
U.S. use its territory for relaying programs of the Free Asia
Radio because such authorization would jeopardize relations with
Thailand's neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The Free Asia Radio, initiated and sponsored by the American
government, aims at disseminating Western ideas of "freedom",
"democracy" and "human rights". It was considered an
anti-communist tool during the cold-war period.
</P>
<P>
Mukdasiri was asked to clarify Thailand's decision on the
matter by the head of the press department of Lao's foreign
ministry, Touane Vorasane.
</P>
<P>
The Thai diplomat said the United States had pursued this
matter for two years and Thailand had always refused to
comply.

BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Some 4,200 fires occurred in
Beijing last year, resulting in economic losses of about seven
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
To better control future blazes, the city improved its

</P>
<P>
"The loss will be tremendous if fires occur in these areas,"
Liu stressed, adding that the local residents lack a sense of fire

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Shipbuilding Orders Inch Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 6 (Xinhua) -- South Korean shipbuilding firms
have started to recover from a business slump with overseas orders
gradually trickling in over the past few months.
</P>
<P>
The Korea Shipbuilders Association (KSA) said here today that
South Korea received 2.67 million gross tons of shipbuilding
orders in the first eight months of this year. This was about 70
percent of the orders received during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Korea's shipbuilding activity sagged for the first five months
of this year, with orders totalling less than half of that during
the same period last year. But it started to inch up in June and
had continued to gain momentum.
</P>
<P>
Overseas shipbuilding orders for the first seven months of this
year amounted to 61 percent of orders received in the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Korea's backlog of orders, which is based on
the gross tonnage of ships, has also began to increase along with
the additional orders. By the end of July, it stood at 11.7
million tons, up 0.3 percent from the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The backlog was expected to rise to 12 million tons by the end

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Boost Overseas Oil Development Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 6 (Xinhua) -- To the background of United
States missile attacks against Iraq, the South Korean government
has decided to significantly increase the money it spends on
developing overseas oil sources and supporting exploration.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) said
here today that this was aimed at providing a stable supply of
petroleum.
</P>
<P>
It would conduct aggressive oil diplomacy with major
oil-producing countries, and support the 29 oil development and
exploration projects that 15 South Korean firms are currently
undertaking in 15 different countries.
</P>
<P>
To that end, the MITI had asked the Ministry of Finance and
Economy (MFE) to increase the overseas oil development survey fund
from 1.08 million U.S. dollars this year to 2.44 million
U.S. dollars next year, and the overseas oil field development
fund from 82 million U.S. dollars to 105.7 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The MITI had also asked the MFE to establish a new 12.5 million
U.S. dollar fund for oil-related debt guarantees next year.
</P>
<P>
If the MITI's requests are granted, South Korea's overseas oil
development budget next year will increase 31.4 percent, to 120.64
million U.S. dollars, from this year's 91.8 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> India Condemns U.S. Missile Attacks on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 6 (Xinhua) -- India today called upon the
United States to refrain from any further attack on Iraq and
respect its sovereignty and territorial integrity as reiterated in
the U.N. Security Council resolutions, the Press Trust of India
reported.
</P>
<P>
"The government of India is unable to accept the justification
put forward for the bombing on the grounds of alleged Iraqi
contravention of U.N. Security Council resolutions or the
protection of the interests of the U.S. and its allies in the
Gulf," External Affairs Minister I.K. Gujral said in a statement
in both houses of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after all-round condemnation of the U.S.
action by members of all parties in the two houses, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The MPs termed the U.S. action as deplorable and in violation
of all norms of the international law.
</P>
<P>
Expressing serious concern over the U.S. action, Gujral said
India was watching the situation closely.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite widespread international sentiments
against the U.S. action, the U.S. again launched cruise missile
attacks on Iraq on Wednesday, which he said were "highly
regrettable."
</P>
<P>
Gujral said India was particularly distressed over the freezing
of the U.N. Security Council's relaxation of the embargo on Iraq's
oil export for purchasing medicine and food for the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Iraqi population, including innocent women and
children, had been subject to great hardship and deprivation by
U.N. sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Popov Facing Two Months Convalescence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian star Alexander Popov,
badly hurt a fortnight ago in a stabbing incident at a Moscow
street market, was set to leave hospital Friday but faced two
months out of action, his doctor said.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Atlanta double gold medal swimmer was stabbed
in the lung and kidneys by a watermelon seller after becoming
embroiled in a fight with market vendors.
</P>
<P>
His team doctor, Alexandre Fyodorov, told ITAR-TASS that
"Alexander Popov will be able to return to light training within
45 to 60 days."
</P>
<P>
"It's too early to say whether Alexander will recover 100
percent or just 99 percent, but his great physical strength and
morale allows us to be optimistic," Fyodorov added.
</P>
<P>
"Alexander was really lucky. His lung was stabbed just as he
breathed out, which is why the injury to it was only superficial,"
Fyodorov said.
</P>
<P>
The 1.97 meter-tall Popov, who generally trains in Australia,
is unbeaten in the 50 meters pool since 1991 and is on record as
saying he intends to defend his Olympic titles in Sydney in 2000.
</P>
<P>
He won the world championship the same year and the European
title in 1993 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
The star has denied rumours that he might apply for Australian
citizenship in time for the 2000 Games.

<HEADLINE> China Plans to Increase Train Speeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, September 6 (Xinhua) -- China has drawn up a fast
track solution to its crippling rail bottleneck problem.
</P>
<P>
Lack of funds is preventing the country from building many new
lines. So its rail departments have declared the raising of train
speeds as just the ticket.
</P>
<P>
It will mean more, faster trains, with travel time being
cut. The bonus for rail passengers is that the current slow-coach
maximum speeds of 70 kilometers an hour will be doubled.
</P>
<P>
Officials agreed it is impossible for China to solve the
problem of strain on railway transport by only opening new rail
lines, due mainly to the lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
Chinese railway departments have already been making progress
in the high-speed drive, noted Cao Bingxun, engineer in chief of
the Beijing Railway Bureau.
</P>
<P>
He said the speed-increase tests are being conducted on rail
lines in north China's Hebei Province, mainly focusing on the
Beijing-Qinhuangdao railway, with the highest speed on the line
already registering 120 km.
</P>
<P>
"This is a prelude to a national drive to quicken the operation
of trains," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-Shijiazhuang railway is being upgraded, in
preparation to soon launch express service.
</P>
<P>
High-speed trains are also projected to run on rail lines from
Beijing to Shenyang, capital of northeast China's Liaoning
Province, and Jinan, capital city of Shandong Province in east
China, at a speed of more than 150 km per hour, or doubling
the original figure.
</P>
<P>
Under China's Ninth Five-Year Plan of the Ministry of Railways,
train speeds will be raised to 140 kph on main lines of Beijing to
Guangzhou, Harbin, and Shanghai, and eventually to 160 km per hour.
</P>
<P>
Trains have been a major means of transportation in China for
many years. The crowded rail network bears 50 percent of passenger
flow and 70 percent of cargo flow. Railway transport became a
"bottleneck" restricting the national economic boom after the
policy of reform and opening-up was implemented in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the train speed stands at about 70 km per hour, and
cargo trains run even slower, problems caused by the low quality
of tracks and crossings, as well as too many turns on rail lines.
</P>
<P>
China planned to build an express railway between the Chinese
capital of Beijing and Shanghai, to alleviate transport pressure
in east China. The Ministry of Railways, however, estimates that
only a short section will be available for test purposes by the
year 2000. The ministry says it is hard to generate the necessary
investment, which will reach 80 billion yuan in total. So far only
the feasibility study has been done.
</P>
<P>
Increasing train speeds is viewed as an efficient low cost
measure to improve rail lines, compared to building new lines, Cao
noted, adding that the first quasi-express railway from Guangzhou
to Shenzhen, in south China's Guangdong Province, which went into
operation in 1994, was an example of successfully upgrading rail
management.
</P>
<P>
"Tests in Hebei also prove that the development trend of
the country's railways lies in high speed," Cao said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Participants in the first
conference of the "21st Century Forum," which closed today in
Beijing, deemed the event a success, saying it was a platform for
the far-sighted and free exchange of opinions.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the three-day meeting was on the future economic
and political development in Asia, China in particular, in the
next century.
</P>
<P>
Three panel discussions were held that involved over 50
political figures and scholars from 19 countries. Nearly 75
speeches were given that presented a range of views on China's
role in the future.
</P>
<P>
Germany's former Federal Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, who took
part in Thursday's discussions, said that the forum was
well-organized, and could well be the "highest-level international
symposium hosted by China."
</P>
<P>
Nobuo Matsunaga, former Japanese Ambassador to the US and
current adviser to the Japanese Foreign Ministry, said that
everyone who attended spoke freely during the session, which is
"very conducive to enhancing mutual understanding." He said he is
willing to participate in the next forum.
</P>
<P>
Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger praised the
meeting's outcome and also China's organizing efforts, adding that
this first forum marks a good beginning for others to follow.
</P>
<P>
Most of those in attendance said they believed it is beneficial
to talk openly about the issues of common concern that face
Asia. They also expressed their satisfaction with the "active
atmosphere" that was present during the discussions.
</P>
<P>
The forum, which was sponsored by the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, received over
40 correspondents from 11 Chinese media organizations, and over 30
journalists from about 30 media agencies of 14 countries.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a congratulatory letter was sent from the Beijing
Office of the League of Arab States to the forum's secretary,
asking for manuscripts of the speeches.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, diplomatic envoys from Switzerland, Brazil
and Uruguay and other countries expressed their hopes of joining
in the forum.

<P>
XIAMEN, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Coming and going for Taiwan
business people is to be made easier in Xiamen City in east China's
Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The city plans to ease entry and exit conditions for Taiwan
business people, and those who have purchased houses in the city.
</P>
<P>
According to a city official, the new regulation, effective
from September 8, specifies that Taiwanese people who have
purchased houses in the city will be permitted to apply for
two-year temporary residence certificates, and multi entry and
exit certificates.
</P>
<P>
Their families can also enjoy the preferential terms, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwanese people, who have businesses, investments or who study
in Xiamen, can renew their multi entry and exit certificate
extending procedures 15 days before the expiry date of the
previous terms.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of Taiwan people are coming to Chinese
mainland for travel and doing business.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen, separated from Taiwan by the straits, has become a
major entry gate for Taiwanese people to mainland areas, and one
of Chinese cities with major Taiwan investments.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that one million Taiwanese people have come to
the mainland via Xiamen Customs over the past few years. The
number accounts for one fifth of the total.

<HEADLINE> Last Dynasty Had over 50 Embassies, Consulates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Qing Dynasty (1644-1911),
China's last feudal dynasty, established 16 embassies and about 40
consulates in other countries and regions, according to archives.
</P>
<P>
The archives show that in 1875, the Qing government sent
ambassadors and consuls to Britain, the United States, Spain and
Peru, the first group of Qing diplomats dispatched.
</P>
<P>
Wu Zhaobo, an archivist who is attending the 13th International
Conference on Archives, said that the Qing Dynasty was one of the
strongest countries in the world in its time, but it pursued a
closed-door policy to the West until the beginning of the Opium
War (1840-1842).
</P>
<P>
After the war, Western countries began to establish consulates
in China's trading ports, such as Guangzhou, the capital of
Guangdong Province, Fuzhou, the capital of Fujian Province, and
Xiamen in Fujian.
</P>
<P>
In 1860, Britain and France were the first countries to send
embassadors to China, and were followed by other Western countries.
</P>
<P>
During the Qing Dynasty, foreign countries opened 25 consulates
in Hong Kong, 20 in Shanghai and 17 in Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
China, one of the oldest civilized countries in the world,
steadily increased economical and cultural relations with other
countries due to commerce from two "Silk Roads," one on land and
another shipping route at sea.
</P>
<P>
China currently has over 150 embassies and 50 consulates in
other countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States and British
embassies in Lusaka said here today they had not "blackmailed"
the Zambian government to grab a voters' registration contract.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, Zambian Defense Minister Ben Mwila had
criticized the two countries for threatening to cut their
economic aid to Lusaka if the contract was awarded to Nikuv, an
Israeli company.
</P>
<P>
Denying the charge, a spokeswoman of the British High
Commission in Zambia said the British government did not and
would not link the award of the contract to its aid to Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said a British company had made a bid worth
six million U.S. Dollars instead of 18 million U.S. Dollars, much
lower than Nikvu, but admitted that British diplomats had urged
the Zambian government to consider the British bid.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman for the U.S. Information Agency accused
Zambia of "telling lies", saying the original list of bidders
showed that the firm from the United States bid at a lower rate
than that of Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said the Zambian government was free to select any company
without interference from any country, denying that the U.S.
government had linked the contract to the U.S. economic aid to
Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Indian Opposition Leader Faces Corruption Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A special court in India
today decided to charge L.K. Advani, president of the opposition
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), with criminal conspiracy and
corruption in the 18 million U.S. dollar hawala case, the Press
Trust of India said.
</P>
<P>
The hawala case is a bribery scandal in which at least two
dozens of leading Indian politicians, including Advani, have been
accused of receiving money from illegal foreign exchange traders
(hawala dealers).
</P>
<P>
In an order delivered in the court here, special judge V.B.
Gupta said that on the basis of the prosecution charge sheet filed
by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and related
documentary evidence, a prima facie case is made out against
Advani under the Penal Code and the Prevention of Corruption Act.
</P>
<P>
However, Advani was not present in the court today. He sent an
application for exemption from personal appearance, pleading that
an important meeting of the central committee of the party was
scheduled for the day and he could not attend the court.
</P>
<P>
The judge first fixed September 13 for formally framing of the
charges but Advani's counsels pleaded that Advani would be busy
with election campaign (in Uttar Pradesh) and should, therefore,
be given at least two weeks' time.
</P>
<P>
Accepting the request, the judge fixed September 26 for
formally framing the charges against the BJP chief.
</P>
<P>
The judge warned that if the accused fails to appear in the
court on that day, the process under law would be initiated
against him.
</P>
<P>
The CBI, in its charge sheet filed against Advani on January 16
this year, had accused him of receiving a total of six million
rupees (169,000 U.S. dollars) as "illegal gratification" from
hawala dealers.
</P>
<P>
The court had issued a non-bailable arrest warrant against
Advani on February 29 after taking cognizance of the CBI charge
sheet. But the BJP chief got anticipatory bail from the Delhi High
Court on the same day after he challenged the issuance of arrest
warrant by the special judge.
</P>
<P>
Advani himself has denied having any link with the hawala
dealers figured in the case and receiving any money from them. His
party, the BJP, became the largest party in the country following
the recent general elections.

<HEADLINE> Zou Jiahua Calls on Northeast China to Boost Regional Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, September 6 (Xinhua) -- China's vice-premier Zou Jiahua
has urged the country's northeast to change its economic system
from a traditional planned economy to a market economy.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the area to promote regional development by
turning economic growth from extensive to intensive.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar in Dalian on Northeast China's regional
economic development, the vice-premier said Northeast China had
made huge contributions to the national economic growth over the
past four decades, and will continue to play an important role in
national economic development in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Northeast China consists of Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang
provinces, and part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Appreciating that Northeast China has come across difficulties in
its economic development in recent years, Zou said that the main
causes derived from historical factors and the area's inability to
adapt itself from a planned economy to a market economy.
</P>
<P>
"So long as we face difficulties squarely and realistically,
accelerate the two fundamental shifts, follow the principle of a
socialist market economy, rely on the people, and bring into play
superiority, we will surely overcome difficulties and win the
victory," Zou said.
</P>
<P>
To shift the economic system from a traditional planned economy
to a market economy, it is essential to gear the market to needs,
and to readjust its industry.
</P>
<P>
Zou called on Northeast China to make full use of its rich
natural conditions, to steadily increase grain production and
expand livestock breeding, to become one of China's major
market-oriented grain production and processing bases.
</P>
<P>
Northeast China was urged to protect, develop and make proper
use of its abundant forest resources, to develop machinery,
petrochemicals, iron and steel, the automobile industry,
ship-making and energy industries.
</P>
<P>
Zou has called on local state-owned industrial enterprises to
deepen their reforms, undergo technical transformations, and
produce more market-oriented products.
</P>
<P>
"Northeast China, which has coastal and border areas, and is
located at the center of Northeast Asian Economic Zone, must take
the advantage to open itself wider to the outside world, and
explore the international market," Zou said.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged Northeast China provinces and region to join
hands to boost water conservancy, power, transport, trade, science
and technology and information.
</P>
<P>
The three-day seminar was sponsored by the State Planning
Commission and attracted leading officials from Northeast China
provinces and region.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Does Not Object If U.S. Cancels F-16 Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has no objection if
the U.S. cancels its plan to sell F-16 fighters to the country, a
government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We have no objection if they cancel the sale (of the F-16
fighters)," State Secretary Moerdiono said when he was asked to
comment on Washington's decision to review the sale of nine F-16s
to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The nine planes were part of the 28 planes originally under an
agreement to be sold to Pakistan, but the delivery was blocked by
a U.S. congressional amendment prompted by Islamabad's nuclear
policy.
</P>
<P>
On the U.S. decision to delay the sale of the F-16s because of
human rights issues, Moerdiono said that human rights abuses also
occur in the U.S. despite its claims of upholding human rights.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that it was U.S. President Bill Clinton himself who
initiated the discussion of the fighter sale with Indonesian
President Soeharto when they met at the White House in October
last year.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Washington, the U.S. government has
decided to delay the sale of the F-16 fighters to Indonesia until
they review the deal early next year.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Up Information System Against Floodings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A sophisticated flood
monitoring system has gone into operation in China.
</P>
<P>
The meteorological flood information system will provide the
State Council and relevant departments with accurate information
on flood situations across China.
</P>
<P>
The system, established by the Chinese Academy of Surveying and
Mapping, will not only give a clear indication of the distribution
of flood sites, but also has the capability of providing a
comprehensive appraisal of flood situations, covering flood-hit
areas, the population affected, and economic losses.
</P>
<P>
To establish the system, researchers put together a large
volume of information on flood control, meteorological data, and
comprehensive geographic information, making it a very practical
information system.
</P>
<P>
China has long suffered from floods, with the country hit by
1,029 floods between 206 BC and 1949, the founding year of the
People's Republic of China.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Strengthens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
firmer against the U.S. dollar today, which was traded at 79.40
U.S. cents at the close compared with 79.03 U.S. cents at
Thursday's close.
</P>
<P>
Local traders expected the currency to test 80 U.S. cents next
week. The Aussie dollar was buoyed by huge buying interest from
Japan and the United States after the Australian Reserve Bank
ruled out a cut in interest rates in the short term.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the higher-than-expected job and wage growth
in the U.S. could have some negative impact on the Australian
dollar. But investors remained cautious to see whether the U.S.
Federal Reserve was to cut short-term interest rates.
</P>
<P>
A rise in U.S. interest rates will diminish the interest rate
difference between the U.S. dollar and the Australian dollar,
making the local currency less attractive to overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was traded firmer against the Japanese
yen at 86.68 yen from 86.01 yen on Thursday.
</P>

It ended firmer against the German mark at 1.1796 marks from

<HEADLINE> Future for Asia Looks Promising: Shultz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) --US Former Secretary of State
George Shultz said in Beijing today that the future for Asia looks
very promising.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark during a closing ceremony speech at the
"21st Century Forum", sponsored by the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
Shultz said he shares the view with Lee Kuan Yew, Noboru
Takeshita, Helmut Schmidt, Henry Kissinger and many other
participants at the forum, that the future for Asia looks very
promising.
</P>
<P>
"We are lucky to be here at this time with such promise at
hand, " he said, adding that "our task is to be sure we don't
throw away that opportunity by letting security problems
unnecessarily disrupt."
</P>
<P>
Shultz noted that while the world prospers, there are threats
that mainly come from the security side, including terrorism,
which are devastating to economic activities, willingness to
invest, trade, and being comfortable with inter-dependence that
comes with trade. He hopes security issues be resolved and handled
well.
</P>
<P>
On the US presence in Asia, Shultz believes his country's
presence in the region will continue, and will continue to be
constructive.
</P>
<P>
On US-China relations, Shultz said, "China is not just a big,
important country, China is a country for which there is much to
respect, not only for its long history and culture. China deserves
respect for what it's doing today."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the economic achievements China has made are
extraordinary. From a diplomatic stand point, he said, "if a
country is important, that means you have to work with it."
</P>
<P>
He went on to warn: "Don't get yourself all cut up in words
like "engagement" or "containment".
</P>
<P>
According to Schultz, the Taiwan issue is not on the
constructive broad agenda of US-China relations. Taiwan is part of
China, the problems between the peoples of Taiwan and the mainland
are up to China to work out.
</P>
<P>
"Our interest is by peaceful means," he added.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Shultz also touched upon issues of science,
energy, comparative demography, and trade balances, which he
believes will affect people's life in the 21st century.

region's increasing input in the field, Zhu Guangya, President of
the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference, made the remarks at
the 21st Century Forum in a speech titled "Development of Asian
and China's science and technology, and economic and social
influences".
</P>
<P>
Zhu quoted a policy investment and research report of the World
Bank as saying that "there is no mystery in the economic success
of East Asia", and emphasis on the mastery of advanced technology
is an important factor of the East Asian success.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that consideration of those countries and regions in
Asia which have registered a rapid rate of development shows that
the highest authorities have clearly acknowledged the strategic
position of science and technology, formulated development
strategies, adopted various policies to support the growth of
science and technology, focused on developing applied research and
technology, and strengthened the combination of science and
technology with economy.
</P>
<P>
He noted that, at the same time, the region must pay attention
to the presense of problems and inherent weakness for the
following reasons.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, many Asian countries have developed their economies by
relying on natural resources and cheaper labor forces. But now
economic advantages enjoyed by these countries have declined.
</P>
<P>
To accelerate the transition from labor-intensive industries to
technology- and knowledge-intensive industries is proving to be
one of the most important steps the Asian countries and regions
are adopting to further their economies.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the intellectual gap between the developed and
developing countries is clearly evident further in fields of basic
scientific research. Therefore, the strengthening of basic
scientific research is an important strategic measure in
guaranteeing steady and lasting development in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, various countries are confronted with three major
problems, namely, overpopulation, natural resource depletion and
environmental deterioration, he noted. It is necessary to banish
the outdated development mode, control growth of population,
popularize sustained farming and forest technology, increase the
efficiency of energy resources use, improve the structure of
energy expenditure and develop renewable energy resources and
implement ecological resumption projects.
</P>
<P>
Lastly, the complementary nature of economic factors and
scientific and technological structures between various Asian
countries has increased daily. All the Asian countries, developing
or developed, can fully utilize their advantages in scientific and
technological resources, spread of talents, funds, equipment,
labor forces and economic markets.
</P>
<P>
"It is encouraging to note that these important trends of
future scientific and technological development have attracted the
attention of the majority of Asian countries," he said. "Most
countries have awarded an increasing amount of attention to the
technological contents of national economic development. Many of
these countries have stipulated long and medium-range plans for
scientific and technological development while they have also
greatly increased the inputs for conducting basic research."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The New China Life Insurance
Company, the third national insurance firm of this kind, was
founded in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The new insurance firm is jointly funded by 15 large
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that the setting-up of independent life insurance
enterprises in China this year marks the country's life insurance
market entering into a new era of development.
</P>
<P>
China's life insurance sector has lagged far behind the
developed countries. Currently just one out of every five Chinese
have bought life insurance, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
The fast developing economy has boosted the growth of the
country's life insurance sector. A number of foreign life
insurance firms have also entered Chinese market, especially in
the major and coastal cities.

<HEADLINE> France Celebrates 100th Anniversary of Family Garden Movement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- France will celebrate between
Friday and Saturday the 100th anniversary of the founding of the
family garden movement by Abott Lemire in 1896.
</P>
<P>
Some 200,000 members of 800 family garden associations are
opening their private gardens to public in 30 cities across
France for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
The tradition of maintaining a family garden in France was
first made known by the motto of Francois Voltaire 300 years ago
-- "Cultivate your own garden."
</P>
<P>
Today, the associations of family gardens and garden workers
have made it into a national rule that when 100 dwelling houses
are built, 15 to 20 gardens should be built alongside.
</P>
<P>
The family garden movement evolved into a national movement at
the turn of the century when Lemire turned it into a social
assistance means to help the poor and educate the newly booming
industrial manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
"The real happiness of a boy is to be free in his house, and on
a small corner of the land," said Lemire when founding the "League
of the Corner of Land and Home" in October 1896, which later
turned into the "Federation of Family Gardens."
</P>
<P>
When first promoting the maintenance of a small piece of land
dedicated to flowers and grass, Lemire wanted to keep the husbands
of the households from taverns and drinking by introducing a
healthy and economically affordable activity for men.
</P>
<P>
The first international congress of garden workers was held in
1903 which was joined by political and religious figures, as well
as doctors from around the world.

BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesman said here today that China hopes Indonesia will treasure
the existing good-neighborly and friendly ties between the two
countries, and respect the Chinese government's principled
position on the Taiwan issue.

"China is determinedly against any country, which has
diplomatic relations with China, to form official ties with Taiwan
or to have official exchanges and contacts with it in whatever
form," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
He said the it is a habit of the Taiwan authorities to carry

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Amal, Hezbollah Form Coalition in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's two main Shiite
groups, the Amal movement headed by House Speaker Nabih Berri and
Hezbollah, or Party of God, reached an election coalition "due to
regional and local circumstances," a local political analyst said
today.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the Syrian-mediated coalition, a violent showdown
was ruled out between the pro-Syrian Amal and the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah in the forth and fifth of the five-phase general
elections in Lebanon, Asad al-Khouri, editor of Beirut's Nida
Al-Watan daily said.
</P>
<P>
"The coalition eliminates difficult and delicate security
possibilities in case the two groups possessing all the assets
of force on the ground confront each other in an election
combat," al-Khouri said.
</P>
<P>
After three rounds of elections in Mount Lebanon, Northern
Lebanon and Beirut respectively on the previous three Sundays,
the last two rounds are to be held in Southern Lebanon on
September 8 and in the Beqaa on September 15.
</P>
<P>
"Damascus will be annoyed if it sees its two basical allies
in Lebanon to plunge into a breaking-bone battle in a sensitive
area like the south, and the Syrian-Iranian relations also do
not allow this kind of negative development between Amal and
Hezbollah," the political analyst noted.
</P>
<P>
Amal's leader Berri and Hezbollah's Secretary General Sheikh
Hassan Nasrallah agreed in principle to form a coalition between
them after their meetings with Syrian officials Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Berri and Nasrallah held a meeting with Syrian Vice President
Abdul-Halim Khaddam in Damascus and another meeting with
Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kanaan, chief of intelligence of the Syria's
35,000-strong forces in Lebanon in the eastern Lebanese Beqaa
Valley.
</P>
<P>
Islamic fundamentalists have experienced a nightmare in the
first three rounds of the elections in Lebanon competing with a
overwhelming anti-extremism axis led by Berri, Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri and Druze leader Walid Jumblatt, a minister in
Hariri's government.
</P>
<P>
Hezbelloah has lost two of its current eight seats in the
parliament after one of its incumbent deputy, Ali Ammar, was
defeated in Mount Lebanon and another deputy, Mohammed Berjaoui,
was defeated in Beirut.

LONDON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- British Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang on Thursday
restored the Post Office monopoly on delivering mails, even though
the postal workers union dispute remains unresolved.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke led the
Tory assault on Labor's tax policy on Thursday, claiming that the
average family would be 700 pound (about 1,050 U.S. dollars) a
year better off by the time of the general election.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Tory divisions over Europe were reopened on Thursday after
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke supported a warning from Britain's
largest companies that the Government should not rule out a single
currency.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Amal, Hezbollah Form Coalition in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Sunni premier described the election as a "battle between
the moderates and extremists."
</P>
<P>
Hariri and his allies won 14 out of 19 seats in the third round
of the elections in Beirut, making him the chief of the largest
bloc in the next 128-seat house.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-two seats have found their owners while the remaining
46, 21 of which are reserved for Moslem Shiites, will be decided
in Southern Lebanon and in the Beqaa.
</P>
<P>
Al-Khouri said that the billionaire prime minister will be
"the biggest loser" in the Amal-Hezbollah coalition since it
obstructs Hariri's plan to downsize Hezbollah politically and
electionally.
</P>
<P>
The analyst expected a defeat of all or most of Hariri's
candidates in the last two rounds of elections, which could
result in a return of a powerful Hezbollah bloc into the
parliament, which has sufficiently irritated the prime minister
in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
Al-Khouri estimated the membership of Hezbollah's parliamentary
bloc at more than 10, including Hezbollah's members and its
allies.
</P>
<P>
Quoting sources close to the prime minister, al-Khouri pointed
out that the Amal-Hezbollah coalition, "which was imposed by the
Syrian side for security and regional reasons," could "shake" the
alliance between Hariri and Berri in the next stage.
</P>
<P>
He noted that both Hariri and Berri have benefited from their
alliance in the elections in Mount Lebanon, the north and
Beirut, where the Shiite house speaker grabbed two seats, with
support of Hariri, from Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing Syria's motives behind its mediation efforts between
Amal and Hezbollah, al-Khouri said that the regional situation
was "conservative" on control of a certain political bloc over the
Council of Deputies or the political life in Lebanon, no mater
what the size this bloc is and how big the bloc's national scheme
is.
</P>
<P>
Under this view point, "it is better that in this delicate
stage all the political forces are equal in strength or weekness
so that no single political party is able to impose its wills,
or its political, economic and national scheme upon other
groups," he underlined.
</P>
<P>
Amal, which was founded in early 1970s, and Hezbollah, which
seceded from Amal in 1985, formed a coalition in the last
parliamentary election in 1992, which was also the first since the
end of the country's 1975-90 civil war.

province al-Sayed Ismail al-Gawsaky left here early this morning

general, and in Alexandria in particular," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Alexandria and Shanghai signed a sistership
agreement three years ago, expressing hope that the two cities

China, saying that Egypt will do its best to make the relations
more fruitful.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President On Sino-US Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
has said that China hopes the United States will adopt practical
and effective steps to stick to the "One China" stand, not only
in rhetoric but in action, and to stop creating discord and
friction on some specific issues, but conditions for the healthy
and steady development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
In doing this, the US side should adopt a long-term point of
view and take into account the overall situation of the world and
the US fundamental interests, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The remark came in an interview with Alain Peyrefitte, chief
editor of France's Le Figaro, on Tuesday, when Jiang pointed out
that granting the most favored nation status on a reciprocal basis
is the foundation for normal economic exchanges and trade.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining this reciprocal arrangement is in the practical
interests of the two countries and it is wrong to link trade with
human rights, he noted. Now US President Bill Clinton saw that
linking the two issues does not conform to the US interests either
and decided to extend China's MFN status unconditionally, and the
Chinese government appreciates this decision.
</P>
<P>
"I hope US leaders will adopt a sensible attitude and solve the
MFN question once and for all, so as to establish long-range,
stable, and mutually beneficial economic and trade ties between
the two countries," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The US side should also give up all forms of discriminative
policies in trade with China in order to ensure a smooth
development of economic and trade relations between the two
countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that China's stand on the human rights
issue is clear and consistent, and that it strongly objects to any
attempts by one country to interfere in the internal affairs of
another, using the human rights issue as a pretext.
</P>
<P>
If the US side abandons the practice of using the human rights
issue to interfere in China's internal affairs and cause
confrontations, he pointed out, China is willing to exchange views
with the US side on the human rights issue on the basis of mutual
respect and equality in order to enhance mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
The president said that China and the US both have
considerable influence in the world, and that maintaining and
developing healthy and stable ties between them is in the wishes
and interests of the two peoples, and beneficial to peace,
stability, and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and the rest
of the world.
</P>
<P>
Jiang recalled when, in 1992, he suggested that China and the
US increase mutual trust, reduce troubles, increase cooperation
and not engage in confrontation, and said that this has been and
will be China's basic principle in handling the Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
He summed this up by saying, "The key to the healthy and steady
development of Sino-US ties is strictly abiding by the principles
set in the three Sino-US joint communiques, especially those of

SEOUL, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Seoul City Council Vice Chairman
Kim Ki-young was arrested Thursday for allegedly embezzling 1.2
million U.S. dollars from proceeds of newspaper sales, a
prosecution official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Kim, who is also the Chairman of the Korea Newspapers Sales
Corporation, allegedly embezzled the money from selling newspapers
at newsstands installed in subway stations and express bus
terminals under an illicit lease, the official added.
</P>
<P>
Kim acquired the lease from the Veteran Policeman Scholarship
Foundation, which received the lending right from the Seoul
Metropolitan Underground Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Under the South Korean law, the right to sell newspapers at
subway stations may only be leased to welfare foundations.
</P>
<P>
The official said that Kim also allegedly evaded corporate
income taxes by only declaring 10 percent of the proceeds.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an official of the Veteran Policeman Scholarship
Foundation was also arrested on similar charges.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President On Sino-European Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin talked about a
wide-range of topics in Sino-European relations in an interview
with Alain Peyrefitte, chief editor of France's Le Figaro, on
September 3, in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Concerning economic and trade relations, Jiang said that
developing economic relations and trade with all countries,
including those of Europe is the Chinese Government's policy and
that the principle is one of equality, and mutual benefit and
advantage.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chinese companies ordered aircraft from Airbus
Industrie on the basis of these principles, and that "We believe
that Airbus, provided it constantly improves its service and
competitive price, can occupy a favorable place in the
international aircraft market."
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that all countries, no matter what size, have
strong points and advantages in the world economy.
</P>
<P>
China has a large market which is believed to have good
prospects, and no doubt, good bilateral relations are conducive to
the development of economic relations and trade and to expanded
business in China.
</P>
<P>
On Sino-French relations, Jiang said that because both
countries are permanent members of the UN Security Council, they
both occupy an important position in world affairs and have a
major responsibility to maintain world peace and security.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome France to play a positive and constructive role in
international affairs. China and France share similar or identical
views on many major international issues, and have fine
cooperation in diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
We are willing to increase cooperation with France in all
aspects in the UN, because this is not only in the two countries'
interest, but also helpful for the UN's handling of the world's
affairs in a fair and more balanced way, and for maintaining the
interests and rights of Third World countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China and France have already had good
results in economic and trade cooperation and that this has great
potential.
</P>
<P>
The president said that an important characteristic of today's
world is the increasing plurality, and relations between Asia and
Europe have made encouraging progress recently. The success of the
first Asian-European meeting reflected the common desire of Asian
and European countries to increase cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that President Chirac and other leaders have made
positive contributions by holding the meeting, a fact that China
appreciates.
</P>
<P>
"Improving Asian-European cooperation not only helps improve
relations of the two continents' countries, but helps maintain
world peace and improve regional stability and those countries'
economies.
</P>
<P>
"Looking to the 21st century, we believe that the prospects for
strengthening cooperation between Asia and Europe are bright and
broad," he concluded.
</P>
<P>
Peyrefitte extended the sincere greetings of President Chirac
to Jiang, who expressed his thanks, asking Peyrefitte to give his
regards to the French president and his wife.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President also took the opportunity to thank Chirac
for his concern about Sino-French relations and expressed his
appreciation for his positive contribution to the long-standing
bilateral relations.

MAPUTO, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The major oppostion party of

<P>
RENAMO leader Afonso Dhlakama hailed the inspection tour "a
success" to both Chissano and himself, the local Noticias

Joaquim Chissano, not others, Dhlakama declared, adding that
his party is satisfied with Chissano's tour, which was made on

</P>
<P>
This was the first visit to Maringue by Chissano since the
warring sides ended a 16-year civil war in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Business Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 6 (Xinhua) -- the following are business
briefs from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The office furniture provider, Finish, has
established a joint venture with Grand Office headed by former
U.S.-based Herman Miller managing director Stephen Coe, reported
the bi-weekly Israel Business Today.
</P>
<P>
The new concern will focus on the manufacture and export of
office furniture items while marketing the products in a number
of countries, principally in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Finish Marketing Manager Eran Harpaz said that the new joint
company is expected to achieve a sales turnover of 4 million
U.S. dollars in its first year of operation. Initially, the
furniture will be manufactured in Israel, and later production
will commence in the Far East.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- An unnamed Tunisian company has made an approach
to Kibbutz Sarid-based Gamal Sarid to acquire technical know-how
and form a cooperation alliance involving the establishment of a
cutting and sharpening disk manufacturing plant, reported the
bi-weekly Israel Business Today.
</P>
<P>
Gamal Sarid General Manager Amnon Shaham said that the offer
was made following a sharp increase in company sales to
France. The upturn in Gamal Sarid's share in the French market had
an adverse effect on the Tunisian company's sales there.
</P>
<P>
Shaham added that the joint project will help reduce
operational costs and provide Gamal Sarid with an opportunity to
further its interests in north Africa.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Israeli Ministry of Agriculture is examining
the possibility of importing apples from Jordan, reported the
bi-weekly Israel Business Today.
</P>
<P>
Fruit Council General Manager Shalom Blair said the local
apple yield is down 30 percent compared with last year's crop
which totaled around 120,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Ministry Assistant Director General Dalia Harel
added that if the price of apples in this country becomes
unreasonable, the ministry will issue a permit to import apples
at a lower custom duty rate.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The National Bank of Egypt has entered into agreement
on issuing Suez Cement Company shares in stock exchanges of the
world and registering the shares in the London Stock Exchange, the
Arabic daily Al-Ahram reported today.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian Deputy Premier and Minister of Agriculture
and Land Reclamation Youssof Wali reviewed a report on two
Egyptian-Hungarian agricultural cooperation agreements on animal
hygiene, agricultural quarantine and production of aetiology-free
eggs as Hungary has know-how in this respect, the Arabic daily
Al-Ahram reported today.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Petroleum Minister Hamdi el-Banbi said three natural
gas and oil fields have been discovered in the Gulf of Suez and
the Western Desert.
</P>
<P>
The oil field discovered in northwest of the Gulf of Suez is
expected to produce 2,500 barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
The natural gas field north of the Mediterranean city of
Matrouh will yield 66 million cubic meters of gas a day and 5,270
barrels of oil a day.
</P>
<P>
The third find in the Khalda concession in the Western Desert
will yield 1.47 million cubic meters of gas and 2.060 barrels of
condensates daily, the Egyptian Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Privately-owned power generating stations will be
established for the first time in Egypt. The Egyptian Electricity
and Energy Ministry received 54 offers for the establishment of a
steam-powered station that will be transferred over to the Energy
Authority after an agreed upon period of time.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: South Africa Should Discard Illusion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- South Africa should discard
the illusion of "dual recognition" of both the People's Republic
of China and Taiwan in developing relations with China.
</P>
<P>
At present, China and South Africa do not have diplomatic
relations, an issue left over from the white-minority rule in that
African country.
</P>
<P>
Since the birth of the new South Africa in 1994, an increasing
number of South Africans of insight have expressed the wish to set
up diplomatic ties with China.
</P>
<P>
South African leaders have also said that they wish to
establish diplomatic ties with China but meanwhile maintain
"diplomatic relations" with Taiwan, attempting to create "dual
recognition."
</P>
<P>
However, "dual recognition" is only an illusion, and is 100 per
cent unacceptable to the Chinese government and people.
</P>
<P>
In 1971, the United Nations Assembly passed Resolution 2758,
restoring to China its legitimate seat in the U.N. and expelling
Taiwan from the international organization.
</P>
<P>
Many African countries participated in submitting the draft
resolution, and when the resolution was passed, most of those who
celebrated the occasion at the United Nations were representatives
from black Africa.
</P>
<P>
South African leaders cannot fail to understand the historical
significance of this event.
</P>
<P>
It is true the two sides across the Taiwan Straits have not
been reunified, but that changes little the nature that Taiwan is
an inalienable part of China. This is a fact generally
acknowledged throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
A total of 159 countries, including 45 African countries, have
set up diplomatic ties with China, showing clearly without dispute
who is the sole legitimate representative of China.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference on August 26, a South African leader
however treated Taiwan as a "nation," disregarding historical
facts and going contrary to common international knowledge. This
indeed came as a surprise to the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
China has long been a major supporter of the African National
Congress of South Africa. Since the birth of the new South Africa,
bilateral trade between the two countries has been increasing
dramatically, opening up a vast range of prospects for economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China's rapid development and its huge potential market is
attracting the whole world. President Jiang Zemin's May visit to
six African countries has laid the ground work for consolidating
and further developing the new-century-oriented all-round
cooperation between China and Africa. It has also created
favorable conditions for boosting bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
China has never been opposed to countries' maintaining
unofficial economic and trade relations with Taiwan after they
establish diplomatic ties with China, but will never allow any
official exchange between those countries and Taiwan. This is
China's persistent stand, which is not to be altered.
</P>
<P>
At present, South Africa is the only regional power among
nations which have so-called "diplomatic relations" with
Taiwan. In other words, among world and regional powers, South
Africa is the only country that does not have diplomatic relations
with China. This is something abnormal.
</P>
<P>
The normalization of relations between China and South Africa
will help both countries to cooperate better in regional and
international affairs and is therefore in the fundamental
interests of both peoples.
</P>
<P>
Anything that is done otherwise would not be beneficial to
either country. In that case, to be frank, South Africa would have
greater short-term and long-term losses.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen has said
China could wait if South Africa needed time to establish
diplomatic relations with China.
</P>
<P>
We hope that South African leaders, as distinguished statesmen
in Africa, will "ascend a height to enjoy a distant view," look
ahead into the future, and through deliberation and a review of
advantages and disadvantages, make the right choice, that is,
severing relations with Taiwan and recognizing the People's
Republic of China as the sole legitimate government of China.

KAMPALA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Scared civilians are fleeing
the refugee-choked northern town of Gulu, 300 km north of here,

</P>

Almost every day pick-ups loaded with household items have

The exodus comes as rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA)
killed 11 people and torched more than 200 huts in three separate
attacks near Gulu town on Wednesday night, bringing the civilian
toll to 53 in one and a half weeks of terror.
</P>
<P>
As the exodus from Gulu town continues, Stephen Lanek, a local
official was quoted as appealing for aid from the government,
non-government organizations, private companies and others.
</P>
<P>
In Gulu town, there are 100,000 displaced people due to the terror
of the rebels.

PHNOM PENH, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's First Prime
Minister Norodom Ranariddh Thursday appealed to Khieu Samphan and
Son Sen, senior leaders of Khmer Rouge (Democratic Kampuchea
Party), to stop the civil war and return to the society.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh made the appeal while speaking at a gathering to
inaugurate two secondary school buildings in Messang district of
Prey Veng province, about 80 kilometers southeast of Phnom Penh,
according to the local newspaper "the Cambodia Today."
</P>
<P>
If the two men, who were signatories to the Paris Peace
Accords, are still struggling to maintain Cambodian territory and
sovereignty from the Vietnamese, they should do it by joining the
national society and cooperate with the people to protect the
lands of the country through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
He urged them to return to the King's umbrella and together to
resolve the poverty issue of the Cambodian people.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the first prime minister noted that only His
Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk has the constitutional right to
grant amnesty to Ieng Sary or any one else.
</P>
<P>
Ieng broke away from the Khmer Rouge's leadership last
month. His supporters are controlling at least two major
strongholds in northwestern Phnom Malai and neighboring areas.
</P>
<P>
The breakaway faction has been negotiating with representatives
of the Cambodian government since Thursday in Nor Kor Phanom in
Thailand for national reconciliation.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President On Sino-Japanese Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said that he hoped the Japanese government can learn a lesson from
history and take actions to regain the trust of Asian countries
and people that were victimized.
</P>
<P>
Jiang was commenting on Sino-Japanese relations during an
interview in Beijing on September 3 with Alain Peyrefitte, chief
editor of France's Le Figaro.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that China and Japan are separated by only a narrow
strip of water and that being good neighbors and developing
friendship and cooperation are in the two peoples' fundamental
interests and conducive to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
He said that Sino-Japanese relations are in general stable at
present, in spite of a few problems and disputes, the major one
being the failure by some Japanese politicians to deal with
historical issues correctly.
</P>
<P>
Everyone knows that the war of aggression that resulted from
Japanese militarism half a century ago caused great suffering
among the Chinese and people of other Asian countries, Jiang
said. This is an "indisputable fact", he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that the Chinese government has always
believed that "past experience, if not forgotten, is a guide for
the future", and that "the overturned cart ahead is a warning to
the ones behind."
</P>
<P>
So, he said he hopes the Japanese government will do this, but
there have been occasional incidents where some Japanese distorted
history and prettified aggression.
</P>
<P>
In recent years especially, Jiang went on to say, some members
of the Japanese Diet have gone so far as to visit the Yasukuni
Shrine to pay respect and attempt to call forth the spirit of
Hideki Tojo and others like him, and some members of the Japanese
Diet have mouthed absurd nonsense trying to cover up the facts
about the war in China begun by Japanese militarists.
</P>
<P>
He said that this shows that there are indeed some in Japan who
are attempting to revive the old militarist dreams, and that their
words and deeds can't help arousing the wrath of the Chinese and
other Asian people.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that the common people in the world should
maintain their vigilance in this, to see whether Japan follows the
road of peace and development or another path, and at the same
time urged Japan to deal with the historical issues correctly and
liquidate the reactionary view of history, and by so doing can
Japan improve it's image in the world and establishing relations
of trust with its neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Tangshan Earthquake Archives Go On Show in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Documents and photographs of
the 1976 catastrophic earthquake in Tangshan City in north China's
Hebei Province have been put on display at the ongoing 13th
International Congress on Archives in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Fushan, archivist from Tangshan who is attending the
congress, said "these historical records will become important
evidence from which, we and our coming generations, can draw
lessons.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the past 20 years part of the Tangshan
earthquake archives had been used as important material for
spreading earthquake knowledge.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake occurred in the early morning of July 28, 1976,
leveling almost all buildings in the important industrial city.
</P>
<P>
The quake, measuring 7.8 on Richter scale, killed 240,000
people, and seriously wounded 164,000.
</P>
<P>
Collection of archives on the earthquake started with the
rescue and rebuilding process.
</P>
<P>
Records on groundwater supply networks, buildings and
communications helped in rescue work and the early resumption of
water supplies and communications.
</P>
<P>
In the rebuilding of Tangshan, archives also played an
important role.
</P>
<P>
A coal dressing plant at Kailuan Mine was totally destroyed by
the quake. The original technological documents helped the plant
resume production in one year instead of five years.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 6.7 million, the city has witnessed a
rapid growth in its coal, power, metallurgical and ceramics
industries.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President On Taiwan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- In an interview with the
French newspaper Le Figaro, Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
that the Chinese government will adhere to and implement the
eight-point proposition on developing relations across the Taiwan
Straits and promoting the peaceful reunification of the
motherland, and create better conditions for the peaceful
reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's remarks came in an interview with Alain Peyrefitte,
chief editor of the newspaper, on September 3, when he said that
the eight-point proposition was put forth by him on January 30 of
last year out of the consideration for the interests and future of
the whole nation, and out of respect for history and for reality,
and in the interests of all sides. It is fair and reasonable, and
feasible as well.
</P>
<P>
"My speech reaffirmed the proposal about holding negotiations
between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits on the peaceful
reunification," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a first step, he said, the two sides can hold discussions
on formally ending the state of hostility under the one-China
principle, and come to an agreement. On such basis, they are both
obligated to safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial
integrity and can work on a plan for future development of
cross-straits relations, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that his speech was clear about Taiwanese leaders'
visit to the mainland, by saying that on the premise of one China,
Taiwan's leaders are welcome to visit the mainland in their proper
capacity, and "we are also willing to accept an invitation from
the Taiwan side to go to Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
If the Taiwan authorities are indeed sincere about holding
meetings, Jiang said, they should give up their political plot of
creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" in the
international arena and stop all forms of their splittist
activities, such as agitating for the so-called "return to the
United Nations".
</P>
<P>
They should also take practical steps immediately to develop
cross-straits relations, especially to realize direct exchange of
mail, trade, air, and shipping services across the straits at an
early date, he said.
</P>
<P>
"However," he said, "what we have seen is exactly the opposite
of this. The Taiwan authorities recently engaged openly in
so-called "northward diplomacy," continuing their splittist
activities. How can this be an expression of their sincerity about
holding meetings between the two sides?"

<HEADLINE> President Jiang Zemin On Hong Kong Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
has said that the government's stand on Hong Kong is consistent,
and that the establishment of the present Legislative Council of
the British Hong Kong government violates the Sino-British Joint
Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong, the principles of the
Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR, and the two governments'
agreements and memorandums.
</P>
<P>
In an interview here with Alain Peyrefitte, chief editor of
France's Le Figaro, on September 3, Jiang went on to explain that,
as a result, the Chinese government's original "through train"
arrangement where all members of the last Legislative Council
could become members of the first Legislative Council of the Hong
Kong SAR was impossible and that the British were responsible.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the term of office of the present British Hong
Kong Legislative Council has to come to an end on June 30, 1997
when British rule ends, and the Preparatory Committee of the Hong
Kong SAR will set up a provisional legislature in accordance with
relevant decisions of the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
After 1997, the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR
will be formed in accordance with the NPC's decisions and
provisions of the Basic Law, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that these measures will not harm Hong Kong's
stability and prosperity, but will in fact help the stable
transition and the Hong Kong SAR's governmental operations.
</P>
<P>
There will be a full guarantee for maintaining the long-term
prosperity and stability of Hong Kong after 1997, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
After China resumes sovereignty over Hong Kong, it will follow
the principle of "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" with a
high degree of autonomy, according to the Sino-British Joint
Declaration and the Basic Law, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
With the "one country, two systems" principle, Hong Kong's
capitalist social and economic system and way of life will be as
it was and its laws will not be basically changed, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong SAR will have an independent judiciary and the
power of final appeal, he said, pointing out that there is no
power of final appeal in Hong Kong under British rule.
</P>
<P>
On freedom of the press, Jiang said that there is no press in
the world that is not subject to laws and that there is no
absolute freedom of operating outside the law. After 1997, Hong
Kong people's rights and freedom, including freedom of the press
will be fully ensured by the law.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that Hong Kong's prosperity in the past can not
be attributed, as some have suggested, to an independent judiciary
and a free system of the press, but mainly to the creativity of
the Hong Kong people themselves.
</P>
<P>
And, he added, it is also due to the Chinese inland area's
support, the economic reforms, and the opening up to the outside
world and the subsequent economic development as well.
</P>
<P>
After the return of Hong Kong to the motherland, the people of
Hong Kong will surely create a more prosperous Hong Kong with the
attitude of masters of the country, he said.

<HEADLINE> APEC Calls For More Cooperation on Small Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CEBU, Philippines, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Third
Ministerial Meeting on Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) of the
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) concluded here today with
ministers from 18 economies calling for more cooperation on SMEs
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The ministers said in a joint statement after the two-day
meeting that they are committed to making continued cooperative
efforts to allow the SMEs to achieve their full potential and to
contribute to the APEC goals of free and open trade and
investment.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the delegates reviewed the implementation of
the SMEs Action Program and discussed how to push for the
globalization of the SMEs by broadening their cooperation in five
priority areas which include human resource development,
information access, technology and technology sharing, financing
and market access.
</P>
<P>
According to Philippine Trade Secretary Cesar Bautista, the
chair of the ministerial meeting, the ministers made progress
especially in exchanging information on policies, programs and
services for SMEs.
</P>
<P>
Bautista said the Philippines will establish the APEC Center
for Technology Exchange and Training for SMEs while China
announced that it will conduct a survey on the operating
environment of the SMEs founded by the APEC in China and the
United States proposed that the various Internet home pages of the
APEC members be integrated.
</P>
<P>
The ministers commended the various economies on the completion
of more than 10 projects in the five priority areas at the meeting
and gave the go-ahead signal to another nine projects that aim to
further advance the SMEs Action Program.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they called for more involvement of private sector
and support groups that address the needs of the SMEs and agreed
that the diverse character of APEC and the different levels of
SMEs development in APEC economies were recognized as important
parameters in further developing the SMEs Action Program.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also restressed the importance of SMEs as the
driving force of the regional economic growth and the policy
dialogue among APEC members.
</P>
<P>
They said they will report the accomplishments and the
development of the meeting to APEC leaders so that while they meet
in Subic in November they would be able to reflect upon the
importance for APEC and member economies to reach out to the SMEs
in the region.

<HEADLINE> Japan PM Reportedly to Call General Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto plans to dissolve the House of Representatives and call
a general election possibly in October or early November, major
local dailies reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspapers, Asahi Shimbun and Nihon Keizai Shimbun, said
that an early general election is likely to be held on October 20
or 27, but the newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun said that the voting day
of October 27 or November 10 is now under consideration.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto is likely to convene an extraordinary Diet (Japan's
Parliament) session in late September or October and immediately
dissolve the lower house to pave the way for an early election,
according to the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Under Japan's constitution, a general election must be held
within 40 days of the dissolution of the decisive House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto had obviously taken into consideration the growing
pressure within his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) for early
dissolution of the lower house, as the current chamber has been in
place for more than three years since the previous general
election, the papers quoted ruling coalition sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the new party
Sakigake, which formed the coalition government with the LDP, are
also inclined to Hashimoto's decision, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, who is the LDP president, is expected to hold
meetings with his predecessor Tomiichi Murayama, head of the SDP,
and newly appointed Sakigake Chief Shoichi Ide before making a
decision on the actual date for a lower house dissolution, the
papers said.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on China's Economic Issues  (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On development disparity between town and country in China,
President Jiang Zemin told Alain Peyrefitte of Le Figaro, pointed
out that some foreign media organizations, mainly from the west,
frequently raised such questions as whether China can maintain its
stability, and whether riots would occur in China's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said, "I can make it clear to all people who are
following developments in China that China is stable now, and will
certainly maintain a long-term stability in the future."
</P>
<P>
He noted, since the founding of new China, the mass of Chinese
peasants have been living and working in peace and
contentment. There were no riots in China's rural areas in the
past, and there will be no riots in the future.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that to study issues of China's rural areas, the
first thing that should not be forgotten is that China is a
socialist country, based on an alliance of workers and peasants
under the leadership of the working class.
</P>
<P>
It is the starting point and end-result of all the policies of
the Communist Party and government, to guarantee the interests of
workers and peasants, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that China has always attached great importance to,
and correctly dealt with, issues concerning agriculture, the
countryside and farmers. This is also a basic experience for the
continuous success and victory of the Chinese revolution,
construction and reform, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said Chinese farmers make up the overwhelming majority of
the country's total population, and the standards of their
material and cultural lives have been improved gradually.
</P>
<P>
Now only 60 million out of the 900 million rural people in the
country have not yet attained the goal of having enough to eat and
wear. This is a great achievement, not only in the development
history of China, but also in the development history of the world.
</P>
<P>
Jiang added that because of this, Chinese farmers are loyal to,
and support, the Party and the government, and are loyal to and
support socialism.
</P>
<P>
Though encounting some difficulties in the course of
advancement, they can understand, and are confident, that all the
difficulties can be solved through their hard work under the
leadership of the Party and the government. This is the basic
reason why Chinese rural areas can maintain continuous development
and stability.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin said, China's reform started in the rural areas,
and Chinese farmers benefit a great deal from the reform, and they
support the reform wholeheartedly.
</P>
<P>
For various reasons the income gap between rural and urban
residents became wider in the course of reform and development.
The Party and the government are working out effective measures to
strengthen, and give energetic support to agriculture, increase
farmers' income, to guarantee co-ordinated development between
industry and agriculture, and between urban and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
We are confident that the once widened income gap can be
gradually narrowed, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of how to narrow the development gap between the
hinterland and booming coastal areas, Jiang said, during the Ninth
Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) period, China planned to implement a
series of policies and measures favorable to easing the growing
gap between central and western parts on the one hand, and coastal
areas on the other, and more efforts will be made to promote this
work.
</P>
<P>
These policies and measures include: priorities given to
central and western parts in arranging construction projects
utilizing local resources and infrastructure projects; encouraging
resource-processing and labor-intensive industries to more to
central and western parts; further adjusting the prices for
resource products, with more efforts to promote exploration of
(mineral) resources in central and western parts; gradually
increasing financial support to central and western parts; more
overseas preferential loans used in the central and western parts,
and encouraging more overseas business people to invest in those
parts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the central government has also asked
economically-developed coastal areas to help central and western
parts develop their economies through various ways.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said, "We are confident that with these measures and the
great efforts of cadres and the masses in the central and western
parts, the regional development gap will be narrowed step by
step".

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Ease in Weekly Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Australian wool prices eased
at Sydney and Fremantle sale this week, with the key eastern
market indicator closing down eight Australian cents at 607 cents
(473 US cents) per kilogram clean.
</P>
<P>
"But demand at future sales is likely to increase," said a
market review released by the Australian Council of Wool Exporters
(ACWE) today.
</P>
<P>
"The rebound in prices for 22 micron and broader wool late this
week signaled a slight increase in demand from Chinese and
European buyers."
</P>
<P>
Until recently, buyers have been able to source wool for prompt
or immediate shipment from Wool International's stockpile. Wool
International have almost met their disposal target of between
182,000 and 192,000 bales for the current September quarter and
buyers are no longer able to source wool from the stockpile for
prompt shipment.
</P>
<P>
ACWE said the western market indicator closed the week down 14
cents at 542 Australian cents (423 US cents) per kg, since the
last Fremantle sales a fortnight ago.
</P>
<P>
Next week's sales are in Sydney, Melbourne and Fremantle with
101,023 bales on offer -- the largest offering for 10 weeks.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Women Demonstrate for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of Israeli and
Palestinian women held a joint demonstration outside the gate of
Israeli Ha'Sharon Prison, demanding the release of the
Palestinian women incarcerated there.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrating women, organized by Bat Shalom and the
Women's Organization for Political Prisoners, called upon the
government to carry out immediately the prisoners' release,
already a year overdue.
</P>
<P>
The women urged the government to honor Israel's explicit
treaty obligation and asked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
to give substance to his declared intention to restart the peace
process, as expressed at his summit with Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A press statement issued by the organizers said that the Oslo
2 agreement, signed nearly a year ago, mandated the immediate
release of all Palestinian women prisoners and detainees held by
Israel.
</P>
<P>
But the agreement was not implemented though nearly a year
passed, since the Israeli army general in charge of the West bank
failed to sign the necessary pardons for three of the women, and
the others, in a remarkable act of solidarity, refused to be
released until their comrades are freed as well.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the Israeli general made it clear that
his actions on the matter are in accordance with the instructions
from the government. President Ezer Weizman did pardon several
other women prisoners, but they, too, refused to be released
until the pardon is extended to all.

<HEADLINE> China's Overall Economic Situation Sound: Chinese President  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The overall economic situation
in China is sound, Chinese President Jiang Zemin has told a French
newspaper leader in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with Alain Peyrefitte, chairman of the
editorial committee of leading French newspaper, Le Figaro, on
September 3, President Jiang said China has always adopted the
approach of correctly handling the relationships among reform,
development and stability when dealing with problems cropping up
in the course of fast economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"We have paid great attention to correctly handling the
relationships among reform, development and stability, in a bid to
harmonize and mutually promote the three," said the Chinese
president.
</P>
<P>
While continuing to carry forward reform and pursue
development, marked progress has been made in curbing the previous
inflation level by adopting measures, including strengthening and
improving macro control, Jiang went on.
</P>
<P>
He said that the retail price hike rate across the country hit over 25
percent for a very short time in 1994, but soon fell. The level
was recorded as 14.8 percent in 1995 from the annual 1994 average
of 21.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
This year retail price rises have continued to fall to a single
digit month by month over the past eight months, said Jiang,
stating that he was confident that the goal of keeping price hikes
below 10 percent for the whole of 1996 could be reached.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth across the country has continued to maintain a
sound momentum, Jiang said. In the first half of 1996, the gross
domestic product reached 2,975.6 billion yuan (358.5 billion
U.S. dollars), a rise of 9.8 percent over the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
The president believed that such a quick growth is appropriate
under China's current conditions, and will not cause an overheated
economy.
</P>
<P>
With a huge population, Jiang said, the problem of surplus
labor will be present for a long time in China, and will sometimes
become even very acute, the president explained.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, local governments at various levels have
always attached great importance to adopting many measures to
create employment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade or so, the registered unemployment rate
in China's urban areas has remained below three percent, which is
low, compared with unemployment rates elsewhere in the world, including
some developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the rural surplus labor, Jiang said that
the Chinese Government has adopted a series of important
measures, which will remain to be the right way for solving the country's rural
surplus labor for the present, and for some time to come.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts have been made to guide and organize rural laborers to
carry out agricultural development in both depth and scope,
in addition to establishing more rural and township enterprises,
vigorously promoting service trades, and increasing the
construction of small towns, increasing the building of
labor-intensive projects, and basic facilities in rural areas to
realize the transfer (away from farming) of rural surplus labor
locally," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in accordance with the needs for development of big
and medium-sized cities, and other coastal areas, efforts have
also been made to organize in a planned way rural laborers to work
away from their places of birth. Theses measures are to promote
the flow of laborers in a rational and orderly way.

<HEADLINE> Three Convicted on Charges of Plotting to Blow Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Three Muslim men were
convicted here today of plotting to blow up U.S. jetliners over
the Pacific Ocean to punish the United States for its Middle East
policies.
</P>
<P>
Ramzi Yousef, Abdul Hakim Murad and Wali Khan Amin Shah face a
mandatory sentence of life in prison, while Yousef faces an
additional trial on charges he masterminded the 1993 New York
World Trade Center bombing.
</P>
<P>
The three men showed no emotion when U.S. District Judge Kevin
Duffy told them "each and every one of you got an extraordinarily
fair trial."
</P>
<P>
The series of attacks was supposed to take place over Asia in
1995 but was never carried out. Prosecutors said the bombings
would have killed 4,000 people in planes headed to Los Angeles,
San Francisco, Honolulu and New York City, and were aimed at
forcing the United States to pull out of the Middle East and stop
supporting Israel.
</P>
<P>
The defendants were convicted of all seven charges related to
the conspiracy. Yousef also was convicted of guilty of killing a
man with a bomb placed aboard a Philippines Airlines jet in 1994,
while Shah also was convicted of escaping from prison.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said the plot was hatched in the Philippines, where
Yousef used his apartment in Manila as a bomb factory.
</P>
<P>
Yousef fled the United States hours after the World Trade
Center bombing and he was captured in Pakistan last year.
</P>
<P>
During the four-month trial in Manhattan federal court, Yousef
acted as his own lawyer. He argued that evidence was fabricated by
the Philippine government to curry favor with the United States.
</P>
<P>
Murad was arrested in the Philippines after claiming he started
the fire while celebrating the new year with firecrackers. Shah
was arrested in the Philippines, escaped, then was again captured
in Malaysia and brought to the United States.
</P>
<P>
It was the third such conviction made by the U.S. Attorney's
office in New York since the Trade Center bombing. In 1994, four
men were convicted in the blast. Last year, Sheik Omar
Abdel-Rahman was convicted along with nine other men of plotting
to blow up the United Nations and other major New York
structures.

</P>
<P>
Health Ministry sources said that Sri Lanka has found no polio
cases between January 1994 and August 1996, and is therefore

<HEADLINE> Inflation Rate Hits Record Low in Vietnam Since 1986 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Commodities and service prices
rose only 2.2 percent in Vietnam in the first eight months of this
year, the slowest price hike since economic reforms started 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rate had fallen continuously in the past four months,
according to an official report.
</P>
<P>
Annual inflation fell from July's 3.9 percent to 3.2 percent
last month, compared with 18.4 percent in August 1995.
</P>
<P>
The state bank cut the short-term lending interest rate to 1.5
percent and the mid- and long-term rates to 1.55 percent Sunday,
so as to ease a cash glut in commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
It is the third cut this year and in January the highest
lending rates stood at 1.7 percent and 1.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of the state bank said the rates may be cut
again.
</P>
<P>
Chu Van Nguyen, deputy chief of the bank, said the rate decline
would help narrow the interest gap between the dong, Vietnam's
currency, and the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
However, the 0.35-percent gap between the lending and savings
rates would remain unchanged, but commercial banks could work out
new savings rates while taking into consideration the gap and the
maximum lending rate, he said.
</P>
<P>
The further lowering of the lending rate would cause
difficulties in raising capital as the savings rate might drop
too, he added.

<HEADLINE> India's CBI Submits Phone Tapping Report to PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bureau of
Investigation (CBI) Director Joginder Singh Thursday submitted a
report on the telephone tapping case to Prime Minister H.D. Deve
Gowda, The Hindustan Times said today.
</P>
<P>
The CBI carried out the probe at the direction of Gowda after
the Congress party leaders took up the phone tapping issue to the
prime minister one month ago and urged him to clarify reports that
the telephones of Congress party President P.V. Narasimha Rao and
his close aides were being tapped.
</P>
<P>
Gowda had denied the allegations but still ordered the CBI to
submit a report on the issue within one month.
</P>
<P>
According to CBI sources, the investigation report stated that
there was no conclusive evidence to prove that the phones of
senior Congress party leaders including Rao had been tapped and
there was no basis to the allegations.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the allegations appeared, Deve Gowda has been
handling the issue carefully because the scandal may snowball into
a major confrontation between the ruling United Front and the
Congress party and undermine the stability of the government. The
Congress party is supported the United Front government from
outside.

reported huge profits in the third quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Royal Bank, the biggest commercial bank of Canada, said that it
had a third-quarter profit of 261 million U.S. dollars, up from
232 million in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
It puts its profit for the nine months ending July 31 at 766
million dollars, up from 687 million in 1995.

<P>
CIBC rang in with a 245-million-dollar profit in the quarter,

It made a total of 750 million dollars in the first nine months
of the year, up from 523 million in the same period of last year.

The collective profits of Canada's six big banks so far this
year are 3.4 billion dollars, up 730 million from the same period
of last year.

Aleman, presidential candidate from the Liberal Alliance, lost
two points to 34 percent, while Ortega, fielded by the National
Liberation Sandinista Front, gained four points to 29.8 percent
compared with June's poll.
</P>
<P>
However, the poll showed that neither of them could get 45
percent of the votes needed to win the October 20 election, and
that a second voting seemed inevitable.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the survey indicated that 65 percent of the
people polled showed strong interest in an eventual public debate
between Aleman and Ortega.
</P>
<P>
Ortega said he will not go into a debate with Aleman unless the
"minimal agenda", a political agreement signed by 21 presidential
candidates to guarantee the October election results, is ready.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Admits Heart Trouble, to Accept Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today admitted that he has heart trouble and agreed to have a
cardiac surgery probably at the end of this month at the Moscow
Cardiological Center.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told the Russian Television (RTR) that he was found
heart problem during a routine checkup recently and the doctors
recommended either undergoing an operation or doing passive work.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said he has chosen to make a full recovery through an
operation because he would never like the idea of working
passively.
</P>
<P>
The president also denied the speculation that he would have
the operation abroad.
</P>
<P>
"I do not want to go abroad. Moscow's Cardiological Center is
able to carry out such operations. The operation will probably be
late in September," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin had two heart attacks last year. After he was
re-elected president in July this year, he, mainly due to health
reason, has spent most of his time on "vacation" outside the
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
He is currently on holiday outside Moscow and is getting ready
to meet German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
He told the RTR that he will discuss with Kohl bilateral
cooperation in the fields of economy, finance and politics.
</P>
<P>
The recent U.S. cruise missile strikes on Iraq are also one of
their major topics, he said, adding that he had approved the
government's statement condemning the U.S. unilateral military
operation.
</P>
<P>
As for the Chechen crisis, Yeltsin said that he supported
national security chief Alexander Lebed in his efforts to solve
the problem.
</P>
<P>
But he also noted that he was against a speedy troop pullout
from the breakaway region. "I think one should not be in a hurry
with it," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, September 5 (Xinhua) -- France aided Britain in
the 1982 war over the dispute of the Malvinas Islands (Falklands),
Time magazine quoted French and British sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the latest issue of its Latin American edition which hit
newsstand today, Time quoted the sources as saying that late
French President Francois Mitterrand brushed aside opposition from
his foreign and defense ministers and cooperated with the Britons
by providing them with intelligence information.
</P>
<P>
An intelligence data system was established between the defense
ministries of France and Britain shortly after the war began, the
sources told the magazine.
</P>
<P>
Information provided to the Britons was mainly about the French
weapons sold to the Argentine military.
</P>
<P>
In another development, France held back an Argentina-bound
cargo of eight Exocet missiles.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine navy stirred a sensation by sanking British
destroyer Sheffield with an Exocet in the early stage of the war
which unfolded around and on the disputed islands.
</P>
<P>
On April 4, 1982, after negotiations broke down with the
dispute unresolved, Argentina took the Malvinas and South Georgia
islands by surprise.
</P>
<P>
After 74 days of fight, Argentina withdrew from the islands and
Britain regained the control of them.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Donor countries have warned that
they will not provide further food supplies for the Rwandan
refugees in Goma, Eastern Zaire, until an accurate count of the
refugees has been carried out.
</P>
<P>
World Food Program officials warned here today that about
727,000 Rwandan refugees in Goma, eastern Zaire, could face a
serious food shortage owing to the impasse over the issue of a
census in camps.
</P>
<P>
Arrangements for the count had to be called off on Monday
following an organized boycott by refugees.
</P>
<P>
Donors and relief agencies said that they need a count so that
food requirements can be accurately calculated. "We urgently
advise refugees and their leaders to allow the count to take
place," a WFP official said.
</P>
<P>
Goma is the biggest of the Zairean refugee centers on the
border with Rwanda. A successful head count was carried out in
July and August among some 300,000 refugees in camps in Bukavu,
eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Aid workers returned to Goma camps today and normal activities
resumed following a three-day suspension of non-emergency services
by aid agencies in response to the boycott.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program, headquartered in Rome, is the largest
international food aid organization in the world. Last year, the
WFP fed more than 50 million people, including half the world's
refugees and internally displaced people.

BONN, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Ultra-rightists' violence against
foreigners for the first half of this year dived by 50 percent,
with only 165 cases, compared with the same period last year in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Federal Office for Protection of the
Constitution said that in 1995 there were totally 7896 violent
occurrences proved or estimated to be related to the radical
rightists nationwide, slightly less than the figure in 1994.
</P>
<P>
He said that the number of members and mainstays of
ultra-rightist organizations fell, by nearly 30 percent in the
last two years, from 64,500 in 1993 to 46,100 in 1995 in the whole
country.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the reasons of the reduction, the official said it
was mainly because more and more people in the society oppose
violence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he alerted people to the fact that the
ultra-rightist forces were still powerful and incidents of
foreigner-targeted violence have consistently occurred recently.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Members Agree to Better Customs Work for AFTA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Customs chiefs of ASEAN
countries ended a two-day meeting here Thursday with a pledge to
continue working to remove all impediments in the implementation
of a scheme to establish an ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA).
</P>
<P>
They recommended that ASEAN formulate a bold and long-term
vision in the customs in the 21st century and developments in the
international trade environment, said ASEAN Secretary General Dato
Ajit Singh told newsmen last night after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) groups
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand
and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN customs directors general further recognized that
customs cooperation was an essential ingredient in any free trade
arrangement. In ASEAN's case, it would contribute to the
sustenance and enhancement of the organization's economic growth
and dynamism.
</P>
<P>
According to Singh, the ASEAN Agreement on Customs provided a
legal framework for cooperation to obtain, among other things,
harmonization of tariff nomenclature, customs valuation system,
customs procedures and customs forms.
</P>
<P>
In their discussion of the implementation of the common
effective preferential tariff (CEPT) scheme for AFTA in their
respective countries, the directors general were pleased to note
that a customs clearing procedure called "green lane system"
introduced at the beginning of this year was proving effective in
expediting the flow of goods covered by the CEPT.
</P>
<P>
In Malaysia and Thailand, Singh said, the new system had
enabled the customs processing time for CEPT-listed goods to be
shortened by 60 percent and 40 percent respectively compared to
that for non-CEPT-listed products.
</P>
<P>
The directors general also agreed to institutionalize their
meetings, meaning they would meet at least once a year. They
agreed to meet in Brunei next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria today expressed concern
over the deteriorating situation in Iraq while Albania aired
support for U.S. air strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by the Bulgarian news agency, the
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zdravko Velev said that his country was
paying close attention to the situation in Iraq and that any
escalation of war there would not only threaten the national
security of countries in the Middle East, but hamper the peace
process in the region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Bulgaria was confident that the problem had
to be solved through political means. It called on all warring
parties involved to halt their military actions and try to solve
their disputes within the framework of resolutions of the U.N.
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
It went on that only a solution acceptable to all sides and
without threatening the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Iraq could help lift the U.N. stiff sanctions on the country,
which had brought huge economic losses to both Iraq and third
countries including Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to Bulgaria, Albanian President Sali Berisha said he
appreciated U.S. strikes on Iraq when accepting the credentials of
the new U.S. Ambassador to Albania Marisa Lino.
</P>
<P>
Berisha hailed the strikes as an "appropriate response" to
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's suppression of Kurds in northern
Iraq.

Under the deal, the corporation, the sole bidder for Plama,
should repay the total debt of about 135 million dollars for the
refinery, whose fixed assets are worth only 35 million dollars,
said Blagoev.
</P>
<P>
The company was also committed to invest about 52 million
dollars in the refinery in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
So far the biggest privatization deal the government has closed
is the sale of 55 percent of the shares of the large-scale Somat
transportation firm to German businessman Bill Betsi, at a price
of some 55 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Opposition Condemns US Missile Attack on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's main opposition, the
Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML), has
condemned the recent United States missile attacks on Iraq,
according to a press report today.
</P>
<P>
"The CPN-UML strongly protests the undemocratic and barbarous
US attacks against Iraq," the report quoted a press release by the
party's Foreign Department as saying.
</P>
<P>
It stated that the US cruise missile attacks, which came after
an Iraqi military movement towards the Kurdish-controlled northern
Iraq, have encroached the Iraqi sovereignty and caused "heavy"
losses of lives and property in that country.
</P>
<P>
The attack is a blow on all those aspiring for a democratic and
 peaceful world order, according to the CPN-uml release issued
thursday.
</P>
<P>
The US attacks have crushed the Iraqi people's right to
self-decision and created a new series of tensions in the Gulf
region, it added.
</P>
<P>
The press release asked the US to respect the sovereignty of
small countries like Iraq and urged to resolve the Iraqi problem
in a peaceful and democratic manner.

<HEADLINE> Former Indian PM Questioned Again over Bribery Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Former Indian prime minister
P.V. Narasimha Rao on Thursday was interrogated for the second
time by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in connection
with a bribery case, The Hindustan Times said today.
</P>
<P>
Rao has been accused of buying support from four members of
parliament of a small party, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), in
a voting on a no-confidence motion against his government in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Delhi High Court filed charge sheets against Rao and some
other Congress leaders for their alleged role in the bribery
scandal about three months ago.
</P>
<P>
Sources revealed that the CBI, which had questioned Rao on
Wednesday afternoon, again met him at his residence in the capital
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials of the CBI are believed to have spent nearly
two hours with the former prime minister, questioning him about
various of aspects of the JMM pay-off case which had created a
furor in political circles.
</P>
<P>
The investigating agency had to undertake this "interrogation"
before the next hearing of the case in the Delhi High Court on
September 9, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Officially, however, the CBI remained tightlipped on the
questioning of the Congress party president.
</P>
<P>
A CBI official spokesman said that "I am neither confirming nor
denying the report (on the interrogation of Rao)."

<HEADLINE> Austria Calls for International Consultation on Iraq Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
VIENNA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Prime Minister Franz
Vranitsky said today that he hopes the U.S. approach to Iraq will
not become a rule and that the Iraq issue should be resolved
through international agreements.
</P>
<P>
Vranitsky made the statement to the press after talks with
visiting former U.S. president Jimmy Carter, during which they
exchanged views on international hot spots, including the
U.S. missile strikes against Iraq since September 3.
</P>
<P>
Carter said the U.S. strikes were "a limited response" to
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's abuse of the Kurds. He hoped "the
raids are over and that Saddam Hussein will comply with United
Nations resolutions."
</P>
<P>
The United States claimed it had credible evidences that Iraqi
forces killed 100 Kurds last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Carter, a former Democratic Party president defeated by
Republican Ronald Reagan in 1980, brokered the 1979 peace deal
between Israel and Egypt, the first peace treaty between the
Jewish state and an Arab country.
</P>
<P>
He arrived in Austria on September 4 to attend a meeting of
the international broadcasting and television policy committee.

<HEADLINE> HK Media Condemn Japan's Intention of Occupying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A flurry of criticism sweeps
the front-pages of many local newspapers today against Japan's
intention of occupying the Diaoyu Islands, which have been part of
the Chinese territory for hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
Under the banner headline "The Chinese People are Roaring,"
Ming Pao criticizes in a commentary Japanese Consul-General
Hideaki Ueda in Hong Kong for threatening to "take necessary
action against the Hong Kong people who encroach on the islands".
The Japanese official Thursday reiterated his government's claims
that the islands were part of the Japanese territory and warned
the Hong Kong media not to "artificially make the issue bigger."
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that these words, confounding black and
white, are absolutely preposterous. Ming Pao demanded Hideaki Ueda
admit his mistake and make an apology to the Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
Oriental Daily News, a local Chinese-language paper with the
biggest circulation, refutes the argument that "To whom the Diaoyu
Islands belong is only a petty thing".
</P>
<P>
Tin Tin Daily News makes it clear in a commentary that the
sovereignty over the Diaoyu Islands is by no means a minor matter.
</P>
<P>
The local media also give a wide coverage of Hong Kong
organizations which urged the Japanese government to give up the
intention of occupying the Diaoyu Islands.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that a spate of demonstrations will be organized
from today through September 18, when the Japanese invaders
occupied the three provinces in northeastern China 65 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Upgrade Health Insurance Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is planning new
health insurance programs to upgrade its existing ones to provide
equal benefits to a wider coverage of the society.
</P>
<P>
Sanguan Nitiyarumphong, director of the Health Insurance
Office, said that there are some problems in the existing
insurance programs and about 30 percent of the population are not
covered by any insurance schemes provided by the state.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry has worked out a new draft health insurance
bill to tackle the existing problems, the official from the Health
Ministry was quoted as saying by local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, all groups of the society will be issued the
same card with the same fund ceiling to avoid problems like
rejection of or discrimination against the patients from the
low-income group at hospitals.
</P>
<P>
In the existing health insurance system, a wide gap of the fund
ceiling is seen among people from the low-income group, civil
service, and those under the social security scheme, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ceiling for the low-income group is between 200-300 baht
(8-12 U.S. dollars), while that for civil servants is 2,000 baht
(80 dollars) and 800 baht (32 dollars) for those under the social
security scheme, he added.
</P>
<P>
The different ceilings specified for different schemes have
made hospitals focus on rights and benefits rather than quality of
treatment, the official noted.
</P>
<P>
However, the official pointed out that the bill still has a
long way to go to become an act, saying it will take at least two
years for the parliament approval.

COLOMBO, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's rebel group

for temporary peace to facilitate the immunization campaign to
eradicate polio, a press release from the LTTE's London office
said today.

</P>
<P>
The UNICEF representative has written to both the LTTE leader
and the Sri Lankan government to declare peace during the stated
days for the sake of children to carry out the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Military spokesman Brigadier Sarath Munsinghe said Thursday
that the army also had no objection to conducting such a campaign
in a peaceful environment.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has successfully carried out the polio immunization
program since the 1980s and no polio case has been reported in the
country since 1993.

ROME, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy said here today that the Middle East peace process resumed on
"the right track" after the landmark meeting on Wednesday night
between Palestinian President Yassar Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Israeli foreign minister told reporters after a
press conference after meeting with his Italian counterpart
Lamberto Dini, that his country and the Palestinians "have
embarked on the right road to find peace."
</P>
<P>
Levy arrived here today to start his European tour aimed at
briefing government leaders on the Netanyahu-Arafat meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said despite difficulties, the new Israeli government "has
decided on a policy to continue the peace process."

<P>
"Of course, this will be based on a reality to fight terrorism
to ensure (Israel's) security," he added.
</P>
<P>
Levy, who had been urging Netanyahu to meet Arafat face to
face, said the high-level meeting on the Israeli-Gaza border was
"the green light to begin discussions of the mechanisms" of
resuming stalled talks on extending Palestinian self-rule in the
West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Dini hailed the Netanyahu-Arafat meeting as "a new prodding" to
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Italy had played an important role in prompting to relaunch the
stalled Israel-Palestine talks as well as in promoting economies
in the region.

<HEADLINE> Booming Economic Belt Forming in Guangxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIHAI (Guangxi), September 6 (Xinhua) -- A booming economic
belt covering an area of more than 80,000 square kilometers has
taken shape along the coast of south China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
For several years running the growth rate of Gross National
Product (GNP) in the belt has been maintained at more than 20
percent. The belt has become fastest growing development area in
Guangxi.
</P>
<P>
In the belt, transportation, telecommunications, financing,
trade and information networks have been set up, local officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The belt, with the capital city of Nanning at the center,
includes the coastal cities of Beihai, Qinzhou, Fangcheng and
Dongxing.
</P>
<P>
To implement the central government's polices of accelerating
the construction of Guangxi as a passage to the seas, Guangxi has
started to accelerate the development of the coastal cities.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, Guangxi has invested nearly 10
billion yuan (about 1.2 billion US dollars) in infrastructure
work.
</P>
<P>
It has completed a highway from Nanning to Beihai, a railway
between Qinzhou and Beihai, optical fibre telecommunication lines
from Nanning to Fangcheng, Qinzhou, Beihai and Guangzhou, and has
finished the Qinzhou and Beihai ports and the expansion of Nanning
Airport.
</P>
<P>
In addition, construction of the Nanning-Fangcheng expressway,
and the expansion of Fangcheng, Beihai and Qinzhou ports, are
under way.
</P>
<P>
It is also to construct a navigation route from Nanning to
Guigang, and expand Beihai International Airport.
</P>
<P>
At present, a naval navigation network covering Fangcheng,
Beihai and Qinzhou ports, is able to handle 10 million tons of
cargo annually.
</P>
<P>
As Guangxi opens wider to the outside world, the economic belt
has become a hot spot for foreign investments. So far, foreign
investors have put 1.5 billion US dollars into the region, and
have established 8,000 joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
The belt has also had an impact on southwest China. Yunnan,
Guizhou and Sichuan provinces, as well as the Tibet Autonomous
Region, have all established offices and development zones in the
belt.
</P>
<P>
By the time the Nanning-Kunming Railway is completed, 80
million tons of cargo a year will be transported from north to
south, to use the ports in the belt as a gateway to the seas.

The group's position on the Helms-Burton Law "is not surprising
Cuba" because "the law not only attacks Cuba's sovereignty, but
also the sovereignty of all the countries", acting Foreign
Ministry spokeswoman Marianela Ferriol said today.
</P>
<P>
The Rio Group firmly rejected the Helms-Burton Law in a
declaration issued at the end of its two-day summit which ended on
Wednesday in Cochabamba, Bolivia, and said the law, which imposed
sanctions on companies in third countries with investments in
Cuba, contravenes the rules that govern relations of co-existence
among countries and ignores the fundamental principle of respect
for sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokeswoman said that Jorge Bolanos, first Cuban
vice-foreign minister, will go to Santiago, Chile, to attend a
preparatory meeting for the Iberoamerican Summit to be held in
November in Chile.

<HEADLINE> Chile Reports Three Quakes off Easter Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Three earthquakes, with one
measuring 7.1 in magnitude on the open-end Richter scale, were
detected today off the Easter Island of Chile in the Pacific
Ocean, according to the National Emergency Bureau of Chile.
</P>
<P>
But the island residents did not feel the quakes, the Chilean
Interior Minister Carlos Figueroa said.
</P>
<P>
The 7.1-magnitude quake occurred at 08:14 GMT, followed by two
smaller tremors measuring 5.5 and 5.9 in magnitude respectively.
The ensuing quakes were detected at 09:10 GMT and 09:46 GMT.
</P>
<P>
The epicenter of the earthquakes was located some 670
kilometers northeast of the island which is 2,500 kilometers off
the Chilean coast.
</P>
<P>
Seismological authorities dismissed the possibility of a
"tsunami", an earthquake-triggered sea wave of high tides.
</P>
<P>
Earthquake magnitude measures the total energy released by a
quake. A quake of 7.1 in magnitude can cause widespread, heavy
damage if it occurred in a populated land area.

<HEADLINE> Property Development Investment Up in Fujian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
FUZHOU, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Investment in real estate in
the coastal province of Fujian in the first half of the year was a
little over four billion yuan (about 480 million US dollars), an
increase of 47.9 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate was 28.1 percentage points higher than that of
provincial investment in fixed assets, and real estate investment
as a percentage of investment in fixed assets rose from 20 to 26.9.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the fact that housing sales were up there are
still 1.1 million sq.m. of flats left unsold because of several
years of overbuilding.
</P>
<P>
the province's real estate business experienced a period of
rapid development in the early '90s, but real estate investment
has been in a slump since 1993 because of the state's
macro-economic control policies.
</P>
<P>
The increased investment in real estate can be attributed to
growth in finances, with domestic loans accounting for 17.9
percent of investment, foreign investment accounting for 17.2
percent, and money raised by the province or other funds
accounting for 64.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The province's real estate development has improved, thanks to
provincial efforts to increase construction of medium-income
residences, following the country's help for low-income people, or
those who live in run-down, dangerous housing.
</P>
<P>
From January to June, development of luxury buildings, hotels,
and recreational facilities has apparently fallen off. With
development funds shifted to cheaper housing, the amount of land
used for development had a negative growth rate. During that
period, investment in cheaper housing reached 3.68 billion yuan,
up 56.5 percent, but investment in land development dropped 16.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the fundamental problem that plagues property
development -- the overbuilding of low-cost housing -- is still a
headache. Although sales seem to be up, there is still a lot of
low-cost housing available in the province, especially in coastal
areas.

<HEADLINE> US Spends Over 3 Billion Dollars in Containing Saddam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States has spent
more than 3 billion U.S. dollars and tied up a lot of military
resources since 1991 in containing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein,
but it is still facing serious challenges from Baghdad, American
military officials said.
</P>
<P>
In northern Iraq, the United States and its Western allies have
kept an operation dubbed Provide Comfort, which began in April
1991, just after the Gulf War ended, said the officials quoted by
local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
The operation, through patrols of the northern "no-fly" zone,
has cost a total of 900 million U.S. dollars since the start,
including an estimated 125 million U.S. dollars this year,
according to Pentagon figures that did not include expenses of
this week's military attacks.
</P>
<P>
In southern Iraq, a similar "no-fly" zone was declared by the
Western coalition led by the United States in 1992. Since then the
operation has cost the United States more than 2 billion U.S.
dollars, including 490 million U.S. dollars this year, but also
not including this week's expenses.
</P>
<P>
The United States is not bearing the military burden alone.
British and French planes have been helping patrol the "no-fly"
zones in northern and southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Percentage of Americans Eating Health-Promoting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The percentage of Americans
eating health-promoting diets is up with the diet of wealthier
whites improving most drastically.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed in a latest study, the first to compare
national dietary trends over the last three decades in different
economic groups. The new findings, by Dr. Barry Popkin and his
colleagues at the University of North Carolina, were published
today in the New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
The study looked at four groups: wealthier whites and blacks,
and poorer whites and blacks.
</P>
<P>
In 1965, wealthier whites and blacks scored lowest in the
percentage eating a healthful diet, and poorer blacks scored
highest, a discrepancy that researchers attributed to the
difference in ability to afford substantial amounts of meat and
other foods high in saturated fat.
</P>
<P>
By 1991, a higher percentage of Americans in general were
eating health-promoting diets, having significantly reduced their
consumption of saturated fats and cholesterol, and lowered their
total fat intake to 35 percent of daily calories, from 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the differences in dietary quality between whites
and blacks narrowed considerably, the study concluded.

<P>
LUANDA, September 5 (xinhua) -- The Angolan government is expected
to send an envoy to eight central and west African countries to
explain reason for repatriating a large number of "illegal
immigrants".
</P>
<P>
According to a government statement issued here today, Dombele
Bernado,the special envoy of the Angolan government, is scheduled to
start his tour to Senegal, Guinea, Mali, Gambia, Mauritania,
Cameroun, Zaire and Equatorial Guinea on Friday.
</P>
<P>
On August 8, the Angolan police initiated a month-long campaign
named "Cancer II" and has since repatriated over 2,000 foreign
businessmen, mostly from the above-mentioned african countries, who
"had immigrated and resided in Angola illegally to conduct business
without being authorized."
</P>
<P>
Bernado explained that the measure is aimed at stablizing the
political and economic situation in Angola, which he said has been
sabotaged by those foreigners who were forging certificates, foreign and
local currencies as well as conducting other 'underground' business.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the envoy explained that the measure was taken "in an
exceptional circumstance", stressing that Angola "will always welcome
African friends and brothers."

LUANDA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan Police today
started to destroy the ''illegal arms and explosives'' they
had recovered from civilians as the war-torn country is heading
toward peace.
</P>
<P>
A first dispatch of 30 pieces of explosives were destroyed in
the suburban areas of capital Luanda, which included grenades,
mines, high explosive shells, tear bombs and detonators which had
been illegally held by civilians.
</P>
<P>
''This is only the start of the campaign,'' said Eusebio Costa,
the police officer in charge of the destruction of illegal arms,
during a ceremony held here today.
</P>
<P>
He said a total of 3,000 pieces of explosives and 17,000
bullets have been recovered by the police from civilians
nationwide.
</P>

During the years of civil war in the southern African country, a
large number of arms, ammunition and explosives have been
controlled by the civilians, which the government said is a
''serious destablising factor'' in the Angolan society in the

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Macedonian Finance Minister
Taki Fiti has said the general trade agreement recently signed by
Yugoslavia and Macedonia provided for a preferential treatment in
trade.
</P>
<P>
Fiti told the Friday edition of the Privredni Pregled business
newspaper in the Macedonian capital of Skopje that all customs and
other duties would be abolished, except expenses of customs
records amounting to only 1 percent for all goods.
</P>
<P>
He added that regular customs will remain, however, for the
sensitive goods quotas, according to the Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
Fiti said the Macedonian list of sensitive goods had been too
broad, and it was agreed that it would be reduced to six or seven
items in 1997.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of signing other accords that
provided a legal framework for the further development and
intensification of overall bilateral economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav Prime Minister Radoje Kondic paid a two-day state
visit to Macedonia Tuesday and Wednesday and reached seven
cooperation accords with Macedonian officials in the fields of
telecommunication, traffic, trade and customs.

<HEADLINE> Kleiner: All Sides to Blame for Postponement of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 5 (Xinhua) -- An Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) official said here today that all
three sides in Bosnia had manipulated the voter registration in
Bosnia, postponing the municipal elections.
</P>
<P>
Han Peter Kleiner, an OSCE official, made the remarks in a talk
with Chairman of the Yugoslav Commission for Bosnian Refugees
Bratislava Morina.
</P>
<P>
He also said the municipal elections in Bosnia would probably
be held on November 17 this year.
</P>
<P>
The Provisional Election Commission of the OSCE announced late
last month that the municipal elections in Bosnia, scheduled on
September 14, had been postponed to next April or May due to the
voter registration irregularities in the Serb entity of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Kleiner, who is advisor to OSCE Chairman Flavio Cotti, said
amendments to the election rules were being prepared and it was
not yet known what solutions would be offered.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE was expecting a decision on an extension of its
mandate, so as to continue work until the holding of municipal
elections, he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton peace agreement, the mandate of the OSCE
mission expires on September 14, the election day in both entities
in Bosnia -- the Muslim-Croat federation and Republika Srpska.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Morina said the voting of refugees in
Yugoslavia ended without any incidents and ballots, including
those sent by mail, received by this morning amounted to nearly 70
percent of more than 80,000 registered voters.
</P>
<P>
Morina informed Kleiner that the Yugoslav commission would
continue its work until the September 14 elections. She also said
that about 100,000 refugees were expected to leave Yugoslavia for
Bosnia on the election day to cast their votes there.
</P>
<P>
Kleiner promised that the peace Implementation Force would
guarantee security and absolute freedom of movement during the
elections in both entities.

<HEADLINE> London, Paris Shares Up Despite Wall Street Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Leading European stock markets
closed mixed today with London and Paris finishing firmer while
Frankfurt ended the session little changed.
</P>
<P>
British shares held up well despite a dull showing on Wall
Street sparked by fears of a possible U.S. interest rates rise.
Market sentiment was generally positive following strong signals
on retail growth from the Confederation of British Industry.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index ended up 14.5 points, just below its top
level, boosted by a firm bond market as the interest rates were
left unchanged after Wednesday's monetary meeting between the
Chancellor and the governor of the Bank of England.
</P>
<P>
In Germany, the Frankfurt market closed an unremarkable session
little changed, with the DAX-30 index down 2.85 points, shrugging
off a small rise in German unemployment figures for August.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the Bundesbank's decision to leave key German
rates unchanged came as little surprise to the market.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the CAC-40 index finished 11.46 points higher, but
did not breach the 2,000 level as traders were kept cautious ahead
of Friday's U.S. August jobless figures.
</P>
<P>
Encouraging corporate results and stronger bonds have the
market a modest boost, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading
British shares closed up 14.5 points at 3,887.2. The Frankfurt
DAX-30 index ended 2.85 down at 2,529.54. The Paris CAC-40 share
index finished up 11.46 at 1,996.23.

<HEADLINE> Dutch 2nd Chamber Speaker: Great Potentialities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hague, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Relations between the
Netherlands and China have been greatly improved at all levels in
recent years, but there are still great potentialities for the
development of Sino-Dutch relations.
</P>
<P>
These remarks were made by Wim Deetman, speaker of the Second
Chamber of the Dutch Parliament, in an interview given to Chinese
journalists on the eve of a three-day visit to his country by Li
Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference, which starts on
September 8.
</P>
<P>
"I am looking forward to Chairman Li's visit and will discuss
with him issues on further promoting the relationship between our
two countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Deetman said that the Netherlands attaches great importance to
the development of economic and trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in recent years, both the Netherlands and China
have made great efforts to improve their bilateral economic and
trade relations, and that the trend of development of the two
side's cooperation in such fields as agriculture, education and
science is very satisfying.
</P>
<P>
He said his government will hold the rotating presidency of the
European Union (EU) during the first half of next year and active
promotion of the EU's relations with Asia and China stands high on
its working agenda.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the Taiwan issue, Deetman said the Dutch government's
stand is clear and definite, that is to remain and develop
diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China and not
with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He said he totally disagrees to the argument by some Western
media that China is playing "economic cards" by promoting economic
and trade relations with Europe.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Sino-Dutch relations will be further
promoted by Chairman Li's visit to the Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> Exhumation Starts in Ovcara, Eastern Slavonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Representative of the
International War Crimes Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia
William Hagland said today that the exhumation of the Ovcara mass
grave in Eastern Slavonia had finally started after a long delay.
</P>
<P>
Exhumation is being carried out in a 50 square meter area in
Vukovar where the bodies of between 170 and 260 Croats killed on
November 20, 1991, are believed to be buried, Hagland told a press
conference in Vukovar. The exhumation would last six weeks, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the surface of the grave had not been touched
since October 1993 when the tribunal's representatives were last
there. Forensic examination of bodies would be carried out in
Zagreb, capital of Croatia, under the supervision of human rights
experts, he said.
</P>
<P>
The exhumation and forensic investigation would be monitored
also by representatives of Serbs and Croats, the Tanjug news
agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
But only one body had been found so far, not at the mass grave
site but in a nearby trench, he added.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal's legal advisor Clint Williamson, who heads the
exhumation team, told the same press conference that the
exhumation was part of the investigation of former Yugoslav army
officers -- Colonel Mile Mrksic, Major Veselin Slivancanin and
Captain Miroslav Radic -- who have already been indicted by the
tribunal.
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, army units under the command of
the above-mentioned three officers had taken 260 people from a
Vukovar hospital on November 20, 1991 and abused them for several
hours before killing them and burying them at Ovcara near Vukovar,
the biggest city in the Eastern Slavonia region, Williamson said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether any exhumations of Serb mass graves in Croatia
would also be undertaken as the Serb side insisted, he said this
would be done any time in connection with an indictment. He added
that the bodies of 19 Serbs had been exhumed in October 1993 from
a mass grave in Pakracka Poljana in the region.

NEW YORK, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Stocks slid into the close

Other major indexes were negative too.

Stock were pressured from the start as bond prices fell on news
that the number of first-time applicants for unemployment benefits
fell by 15,000 to 316,000 last week, an unexpectedly large decline
that provided further evidence of the economy's strength. The
number was six or seven times greater than analysts' expectation.

As bond prices fell, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond
rose to 7.15 percent from late Wednesday's 7.09 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bilateral Talks Between Uganda, Iran Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Bilateral talks between Uganda
and iran was held here today by President yoweri Museveni of Uganda
and visiting President of Iran ali Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, museveni said Uganda and Iran are ideally
suited for the exchange of goods and services.
</P>
<P>
He said this is especially possible because Uganda is rich in
agriculture and can supply iran with agricultural products while
iran is rich in petroleum and can supply Uganda with petroleum
products like asphalt for roads construction.
</P>
<P>
He said the two governments had agreed on particular areas of
cooperation and investments in areas like the industry of hydro
power generation, mineral and petroleum exploration as well as in
housing and animal husbandry when he visited Iran in 1991.
</P>
<P>
He noted that to enhance cooperation between the two countries
in these Fields, there is need to open up communications between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Rafsanjani emphasized the importance of cooperation
between nations for the benefit of their people.
</P>
<P>
He urged the people of africa and Uganda in particular to emulate
the Iranian experience of solving their needs through self reliance.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said Iran is ready to share this experience with
other countries, adding that this experience in self sufficiency
has shown them that costs of production become lower.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Uganda and Iran should ensure communication as
well as banking which he said are necessary to facilitate mutual
exchange between the two countries. enditem
