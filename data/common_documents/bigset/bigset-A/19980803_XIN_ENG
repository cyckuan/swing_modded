<HEADLINE> China Calls for Protection of Chinese Indonesians' Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A leading Chinese newspaper urges
the Indonesian authorities to protect the legitimate rights of the
ethnic Chinese in Indonesia and punish those who brutalized the
minority group in a series of riots.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary for its Monday edition, the People's Daily says
that thousands of shops owned by Chinese Indonesians were
ransacked and many ethnic Chinese women were reported to have been
savagely raped in the riots, which occurred in May.
</P>
<P>
These criminal acts have sparked grave concern and strong
indignation among the people in China and the overseas Chinese
societies.
</P>
<P>
The international community strongly condemned these
atrocities, describing them as being "savage" and "inhuman" and a
blasphemy against modern civilization.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government expressed its deep concern over the
unjust treatment of the ethnic Chinese and the Chinese nationals
living there and urged the Indonesian government to bring to
justice those held accountable and prevent the occurrence of
similar incidents.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that the Chinese Indonesians are law-abiding
people, who have made important contributions to the economic
development and social progress in that country.
</P>
<P>
At the critical moment when the Indonesian economy is in
serious trouble, the ethnic Chinese are still making unremitting
efforts to help lift that country out of the economic predicament
and maintain its social stability.
</P>
<P>
The legitimate rights of the ethnic Chinese, who constitute an
important part of the Indonesian society, should be well respected
and their lives and property be effectively protected, the paper
says.
</P>
<P>
But what they got is just the opposite, it notes.
</P>
<P>
Although Indonesian President B.J. Habibie admitted the
incidents as being "the most inhuman event in the history of the
nation" and pledged no such incidents would happen again, the
paper notes, some people in Indonesia have been playing down the
gravity of these incidents and even denied their occurrence.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that this is an important reason why similar
incidents are still happening even today.
</P>
<P>
The paper urges the Indonesian authorities to face the facts
squarely, take strong steps to punish the lawless and protect the
personal safety and property of the ethnic Chinese, and treat
them fairly.
</P>
<P>
This will help Indonesia restore its credibility in the
international community so that it can attract investment,
stablize the society and secure an early economic recovery and
development, the paper says.

<P>
LONDON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Keith Gillespie moved from
Newcastle to Middlesbrough for 3.5 million pounds 95.76 million
U.S. dollars) on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson moved in for the unsettled
Gillespie after failing to sign Italian World Cup winger Francesco
Moriero from Inter Milan.
</P>
<P>
Gillespie, who moved to St James's Park from Manchester United
in January 1995, had not been offered a new contract by Newcastle
after initial talks broke down.
</P>
<P>
"Keith is a first-class winger," said Robson. "I've been a
long-time admirer of his since his days with Mancester United."
</P>
<P>
Gillespie's agent Ian Elliott said the player had parted
company with Newcastle on good terms.
</P>
<P>
"There is no bitterness...he enjoyed his time at Newcastle, "he
said. "The club thought we were asking far too much in our
contract talks but they never came back to us."
</P>
<P>
Gillespie, signed on a five-year contract, will make his
Middlesbrough debut in a tournament in The Hague next weekend.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- After reaching a settlement with Italy's "BBD"
Arms Company, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) decided to lift the
embargo imposed on the Italian arms companies.
</P>
<P>
Under the new decision, the Italian companies are allowed to
supply the UAE armed forces with defensive weaponry, the UAE news
agency reported in the weekend.
</P>
<P>
In March last year, the UAE decided to ban the importing of
arms from the Italian arms companies in response to BBD's refusal
to take part in repairing a technical impairment in the missile
launchers purchased from the company at 280 million U.S. dollars
in 1984.
</P>
<P>
RABAT -- The Moroccan oil imports in the first five months this
year stood at 2.4 billion dirhams (2.1 billion U.S. dollars),
compared with 3.4 billion dirhams (2.9 billion dollars) of the
same period last year, according to the latest official figures.
</P>
<P>
Over the first half of this year, the Moroccan economy achieved
a 5.3 percent Gross Domestic Product growth.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Two foreign companies are competing to buy 40 percent
shares of the Jordan Telecommunications Company (JTC), which is to
be privatized under a government plan, the Jordan Times reported
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official daily quoted a government source as saying
that the British Cable and Wireless Company has offered 320
million U.S. dollars for the shares and the Southern Bell Company
of the United States offered more than 600 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government decided in 1997 to sell 26 percent of
JTC's shares to a strategic partner in a bid to draw private
investments, update technology, establish incentive management
mechanism and increase the company's profits. The privatization
scope was later grew to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Defying a national anti-smoking campaign, Egypt's
tobacco giant the Eastern Tobacco Company has decided to increase
its production this year, the English-language daily Egyptian
Gazette reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the Eastern Tobacco Company will increase its
production to 60 billion cigarettes in 1998 from 54.8 billion
cigarettes last year.
</P>
<P>
That means it will produce an average of 164.4 million
cigarettes daily, or 2.74 cigarettes for every citizen.
</P>
<P>
To further boost its sale among domestic smokers who account
for one ninth of the whole population, the state-run company is
planning to launch new brands in the local market by the end of
this month.
</P>
<P>
The company, which has a monopoly on the domestic market, is
doing a brisk business outside as well. It has clinched deals with
Russia and Ukraine to export 250 million cigarettes to these
former Soviet states.
</P>
<P>
It has also received orders to supply the U.S. market with 12
million Egyptian pounds (3.5 million U.S. dollars) worth of
cigarettes, and provide 20 million pounds (5.9 million dollars)
worth of cigarettes and tobacco to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
With all the plans, the company seems set to run counter to
the government-sponsored campaign aimed to alert Egyptians of the
dangers of smoking.
</P>
<P>
Hamdi al-Sayyed, head of the National Association of Physicians
said Friday the government has earmarked 300,000 U.S. dollars for
a tobacco awareness campaign targeting juveniles.

<HEADLINE> AL Chief Leaves for Libya to Tackle Lockerbie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary General
Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid left for Libya Sunday for talks on the
recent U.S.-British discussion on holding the trial for the two
alleged Lockerbie bombers in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid is expected to seek response of Libyan leader
Muammar Gaddafi to a detailed plan for the procedures of the trial
of the two Libyans suspected of planting a bomb on an American
airliner that killed 270 when the aircraft blew up over the
Scottish town of Lockerbie in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Britain and the U.S. agreed last month to allow the two
suspects to stand trial in the Netherlands but under Scottish law
with Scottish judges, rather than an international panel of judges.
</P>
<P>
Tripoli is likely to seek the AL's support for lifting the
U.N. embargo immediately upon its approval of the trial procedures.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations slapped an air embargo against Libya in 1992
after Tripoli refused to hand over the two suspects for trial in
either Britain or the U.S., arguing that this will compromise
their chance for a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
The AL General Secretariat sources said that Abdel-Meguid, who
departed from Egyptian northern port city of Alexandria Sunday,
traveled to Libya by land, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The AL chief has requested permission Tuesday to fly to Libya,
but the U.N. Sanctions Committee which monitors the air sanctions
on Libya turned down the request Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The AL General Secretariat issued a statement Saturday,
criticizing the committee's objection to the request, arguing that
the AL chief was to find all possible means to solve the
long-running crisis.
</P>
<P>
Following the compromise of the U.S. and Britain, the AL chief
has expressed his readiness to help peacefully resolve the dispute
in a way that would guarantee the rights of all parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
The AL has supported Libya's stance, and suggested a fair trial
in a neutral venue.
</P>
<P>
In a recent meeting in Cairo, the AL said Libya was entitled to
claim damages for the havoc resulting from the unfair sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The recent compromise of the U.S. and Britain came amid
increasing defiance of U.N. sanctions against Libya.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of the African Unity Organization has
threatened to bust the embargo as of September 1 should Washington
and London fail to agree on a compromise.
</P>
<P>
Three African heads of state have recently defied the embargo
by flying to Libya.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Announces Economic Reform Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 2 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of the first
anniversary of assuming office, Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
on Sunday announced his long-awaited plan to rehabilitate the
country's ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA quoted Khatami as stressing
that the country needs fundamental economic changes in order to
offload economic pressures on the public.
</P>
<P>
He said that his government will focus its works on job
creation, promoting investments and manufacturing, reducing
reliance on oil revenues, controlling inflation, providing people
with basic commodities and repayment of the country's debt.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the people scheduled to be broadcast later
Sunday night, Khatami expressed the hope that the "informed and
strong-willed" Iranian nation will endure the hard times for a
more promising future.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that social justice is given the highest
priority in the plan to rehabilitate the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The president said if a conflict arises between development and
social justice, development will surely take a back seat.
</P>
<P>
He assured the nation that the government will continue to
subsidize basic commodities and medicine in order to preserve
people's purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said that his government encourages the private
sector's role in economy and paves way for investments from various
sources.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Warns Against Overstretching Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa Sunday warned that the Palestinians' patience is running
thin against Israel's continued resistance to a U.S. initiative to
save the Mideast peace-making.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. offer (of Israeli troop withdrawal from 13.1 percent
of the West Bank) is a good initiative. It is already accepted by
the Palestinians but they could not wait for long," Moussa told
reporters following a meeting with President Hosni Mubarak in the
northern coastal resort of Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the peace process has entered a "vicious circle"
without any hope of progress now or in the future.
</P>
<P>
"The elements and potentials of such progress are not clear
under the current Israeli policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Palestinian negotiators have set
Monday as the deadline for their Israeli counterparts to make
progress on the long-stalled peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Direct talks have been going on for two weeks between Israeli
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Secretary General of
Palestine Liberation Organization Executive Committee Mahmoud
Abbas (Abu Mazen) on the U.S. proposal to get the peace process
back on track, but there have been no signs of a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians broke down in
March 1997 after Israel began to construct a new Jewish
neighborhood in Arab East Jerusalem which the Palestinians want to
be their future capital.
</P>
<P>
"What is going on is merely a matter of procrastination, delay
and waste of time without any sign of progress," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
The international community should not stand as spectator to the
peace initiative as it collapses, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa also briefed Mubarak on the outcome of his talks in
Paris last week to propel the Egyptian-French initiative on
holding an international peace conference, along with results of
the meetings held by Al Quds (Jerusalem) Committee of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference last week in Casablanca,
Morocco.
</P>
<P>
Moussa's trip to Paris has reportedly turned the idea into a
plan and thrashed out details of a viable option to the ongoing
U.S. mediation bid.

<HEADLINE> World Leaders Urged to Help Revive Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian leadership,
under the chairmanship of Yasser Arafat, called on the world
leaders on Sunday to help revive the stalled Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
This call was made in the letters sent Sunday to the world
leaders, especially the co-sponsors of the peace process, namely
the U.S. and Russia, European Union nations, China and japan,
according to Jerusalem Media and Communication Center (JMCC).
</P>
<P>
In the letters, the Palestinian leadership put together all
the facts about Israeli exercise in the peace process and
explained the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks have been continued in an endless circle
without achieving any results, the letters said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leadership, in the letters, renewed their call
on the United States to officially announce its initiative, which
asks Israel to withdraw from 13.1 percent of the West Bank during
the second stage troop redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Washington has not announced the initiative, already accepted
by the Palestinians, due to Israel's opposition.
</P>
<P>
The leadership denounced the Israeli government's decision to
create armed militias in the settlements, saying the continuation
of settler's daily provocations and attacks against the
Palestinians and their property will result in an explosion of the
situation.
</P>
<P>
The leadership met in Gaza Saturday night and decided to send
the letters to the world leaders to tell them the true picture of
the peace process, said JMCC.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leadership consists of government ministers and
members of the Executive Committee of the Palestinian Liberation
Organization.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Interior Minister Appointed Acting Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian supreme leader Sunday
appointed Interior Minister Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari as acting
commander of the security forces for better coordination between
the executive body and the security officials.
</P>
<P>
The appointment was made in reply to a request made by Lari to
give him free hand to coordinate the executive body with the
security officials, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to the leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, also
commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Lari said that the mandate
would enable him to carry out his responsibility for providing
public security and putting into practice the security programs.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the interior ministry and the security
forces were strained after the government of the moderate cleric
President Mohammad Khatami came to power a year ago as Khamenei
did not appoint former Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri as the
acting commander of the forces as usual.
</P>
<P>
In the past, upon the request of the interior minister, the
leader normally appointed him as the acting commander of the
security forces, but Nouri was not appointed because he did not
request during his 10-month tenure.
</P>
<P>
Nouri was impeached and sacked on June 21 by the
conservative-dominated Majlis (Parliament).
</P>
<P>
After Lari gained a vote of confidence from the Majlis to
succeed Nouri, moderate newspapers demanded the security forces
to come under the command of the interior ministry in order to
prevent any disorder in the country.

<HEADLINE> Slowdown of Population Growth Called for in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 2 (Xinhua) --A senior Ethiopian official
said Sunday Ethiopia's increasing population is not in harmony
with the country's economic growth and called for a slowdown in
pupolation growth.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's backward technology will not be in a position to
meet the multifarious demands of the people so long as serious
measures are not taken to harmonize the country's economy with
its ever increasing population, which stands at 58 million at
present, National Population Affairs official Genet Mengestu told
a population conference held here.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 10th annual meeting of the National Council of
the Ethiopian Family Planning and Guidance Association, Mengestu,
Head of the Reproductive Health, Youth and Women Department of
the National Population Affairs Office, said that a viable
national population policy has been drawn with a view to
harmonizing the annual population growth with the country's
national resources.
</P>
<P>
She stressed the need to consolidate family planning services
and sex education so as to effectively realize the policy.
</P>
<P>
The official also disclosed that the population of the nation
will reach over 115 million after 25 years if the current trend
of population growth remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The National Council of the Ethiopian Family Planning and
Guidance Association has opened 13 mother-child care clinics, 54
out reachers, over 357 family planning service rendering
stations, five youth centers and seven branch offices since it
was established in 1965.
</P>
<P>
It has undertaken 15 population-related projects since last
year and close to 174,772 youths have become beneficiaries of the
projects.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Opposition Labor Delegation Heads for U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of Israeli
opposition Labor Party headed by its Chairman Ehud Barak left for
Washington on Sunday, seeking to revive the stalled Mideast peace
process.
</P>
<P>
During their week-long visit, the delegation will explain to
the U.S. government, the Congress and leaders of major Jewish
organization Labor's position on the peace march and ask
Washington to publicize its initiative on Israeli troops
redeployment in the West Bank, a senior Labor source said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Xinhua
that the delegation will hold talks with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern
Affairs Martin Indyk, U.S. Middle East Peace Envoy Dennis Ross,
and National Security Advisor Sandy Berger.
</P>
<P>
They may also meet President Bill Clinton, the source disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The trip is organized at the request of U.S. Jewish leaders who
complained to Labor Party leaders that the Party's position and
voice about the peace process are not heard in the U.S., the
source added.
</P>
<P>
Labor legislator Ephraim Sneh said he and his colleagues go to
the U.S. "so that they (the Americans) will know that in Israel at
least half the nation has a different view on the issue of peace
from that of the government of Israel."
</P>
<P>
The Labor party, which oversaw the signing of the
Palestinian-Israeli peace agreements in 1993 and 1995, narrowly
lost Israel's 1996 elections to Likud by less than 1 percent of
the vote.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition in Israel supports Israeli troops
withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Key Labor Party member Yossi Beilin also said "We think it's
important the Americans make public their pullback plan, so that
we, as well as the Israeli public, get a clear picture. It's
difficult to support an initiative which has not been released for
publication."
</P>
<P>
Israel's ruling Likud Party officials on Saturday accused
Labor's leaders of going to cause damage to the government's
policy over the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Uzi Landau, a senior Likud lawmaker, said the Labor leaders
were trying to get the Americans to put pressure on Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to make concessions at a critical stage of
negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has proposed Israel to hand over 13.1 percent of the
West Bank to the Palestinians during its second troops
redeployment. The Palestinians accepted the proposal, but Israel
rejected it, citing security reasons.

<HEADLINE> Israel Terms Iran's Missiles Long-Term Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli military chief
reiterated Sunday that Iran's efforts to develop missiles and
non-conventional weapons pose a long-term threat to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Chief of General Staff of Israeli Armed Forces Shaul Mofaz made
the remarks during a visit to the army's Home Front Command,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The threat necessitates special budget allocations for the
Israeli army and its Home Front Command to boost their defense
ability, he said.
</P>
<P>
On July 25, Iran confirmed that it has successfully testfired a
medium-range missile with a range of 1,300 kilometers, which means
that the Shihab-3 missile can reach Israel and the U.S. forces
stationed in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Shihab-3 will be fully-operational
within a year.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Martin Indyk
warned that Iran is working on a more flexible long-range missile
Shihab-4, with a range of 2,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Israel, which regards Iran as an arch-enemy in the Middle East,
has expressed grave concern over the test and warned that Iran's
ability to develop these kinds of weapons poses a threat not only
to Israel, but also to other countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Iranian news agency IRNA reported that Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami on Saturday defended Iran's defense program,
including the recent missile tests.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said Iran's military strength "by no means constitutes
a threat to the security of other countries, but rather
contributes to the security of friendly countries as well as the
Muslim world."

<HEADLINE> Iranian Hardliners Make Concession, Lifting Ban on Moderate Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative judiciary
made a concession Sunday by conditionally lifting the ban on a
moderate daily after it keeps publishing under a new name.
</P>
<P>
Public Relation Director of the Tehran Justice Department
Saeed Nobari said that Tehran's public court has issued a decree
to lift the ban on the Tous, provided it distances itself from its
banned predecessor Jameah (Society), the official news agency IRNA
reported.
</P>
<P>
Tous, named after an ancient Iranian city, was banned
Saturday, but it was published under a new name Aftab Emrouz, or
the Sun Today, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The publication of Aftab Emrouz showed the determination of the
moderates to uphold freedom of expression advocated by President
Mohammad Khatami and not to give up to the powerful conservatives
who dominate the legislative and judiciary bodies.
</P>
<P>
Tous hit the newsstands only on July 25 to replace the Jameah
by absorbing Jameah's staff. Its publication angered conservatives.
</P>
<P>
A group of hard-liners on Saturday attacked the office of Tous,
beating up its editor-in-chief Mashallah Shamsolwaezin, and even
threatening to kill him.
</P>
<P>
Nobari said Tous was banned because it has violated the
publication law by using a similar form to that of the banned
daily Jameah, which was closed down on July 24.
</P>
<P>
Following thorough investigation of the court, he said,
Managing Director of the daily Mohammad Sadeq Javad Hesar was
fined 10 million rials (1,818 U.S. dollars) according to the
press laws and the Islamic penal laws.
</P>
<P>
As the violator presented no objections to the court ruling,
the final verdict was announced to the Ministry of Culture and
Islamic Guidance to allow the paper continue its publication in a
different format from the banned Jameah, Nobari said.
</P>
<P>
Conservative leaders, including the judiciary head Ayatollah
Mohammad Yazdi, have lashed out at the Minister of Culture and
Islamic Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani for giving green light to
Tous' publication.
</P>
<P>
However, Mohajerani argued that the country's current press
laws did not ban the staff of a banned daily from transferring to
another daily.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance Saturday demanded
the judiciary revoke its ban on Tous, arguing that the points
adduced against the publisher of the daily by the court have
already been fully explained to him and he has been committed to
observing those criteria in the future.

<HEADLINE> Gunfire Rings in Eastern D.R. Congo at Rwandan Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KINSHASA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The rebel forces supported by
Rwandan troops and the government forces of the Democratic
Republic of Congo Sunday exchanged gunfire in Goma, the capital of
the Nord-Kivu in eastern part of the country and at the border
with Rwanda, said reports from Goma.
</P>
<P>
The Goma airport was also closed for security reasons, said
official sources here.
</P>
<P>
The fighting erupted after D.R. Congo President Laurent-Desire
Kabila ordered on July 27 the withdrawal of Rwanda soldiers who
have been staying in D.R. Congo since they helped him come into
power 15 months ago.
</P>
<P>
This signaled an apparent split between the D.R. Congo with
Rwanda and Uganda, the two eastern neighbors which intervened in
former Zaire and helped topple the regime of Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
Kabila said in a speech on Monday to the leaders of the
country's military that he had decided to expel all the remaining
Rwandan soldiers from the country.
</P>
<P>
Local media said that some 800 Rwandan soldiers had returned
home from the former Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The rebel forces seem to be members of the Banyamulenge Tutsi
minority who were the first to start the war against Mobutu in
late 1996.
</P>
<P>
A senior military official said that the fighting was started
by the Rwandan soldiers who refused to go home.
</P>
<P>
The officer, who wished to remain anonymous, said that the
Congolese army is now in control of the situation.
</P>
<P>
The private Rwandan news agency Monday carried a communique by
a rebellious movement against Kabila, which said that it had
launched a war against the D.R. Congo government in Nord Kivu.
</P>
<P>
The communique, broadcast Sunday from Goma and Bukavu on the
national Congolese radio the Voix du Peuple, was read by the
commander of the 10th battalion of the Congolese army based in
Goma, Sylvain Mbuchi.
</P>
<P>
"The province of Nord-Kivu has entered a state of open
rebellion against the government of Laurent-Desire Kabila. In the
name of the government troops we denounce the regime of
Laurent-Desire Kabila,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He listed the ``errors'' allegedly committed by Kabila as being
``nepotism, corruption and bad government''.

The water level at Shashi in Hubei Province stood 43.48 meters
by 14:00 this afternoon, 0.37 meter over Sunday, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, water levels in the middle and lower reaches of the
Yangtze remained high, with the level in Hankou rising slightly to
29.06 meters by 14:00 today, and reaching a record 16.3 meters at
Datong in Anhui Province this morning at 08:00 this morning.
</P>
<P>
Water conservancy experts attributed this year's Yangtze
flooding, the heaviest since 1954, to unseasonably heavy rains
sweeping through the entire Yangtze River Valley since early
summer, and created even more serious silting which has
significantly filled the riverbed in recent years.
</P>
<P>
High-ranking Chinese leaders, including President Jiang Zemin
and Premier Zhu Rongji, have exhibited great concerns about flood
control efforts along the Yangtze, and Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao is

Headquarters.

The staff daily flood briefings planning meetings attended by
officials from the Ministry of Water Resources and other relevant
central departments, senior flood control officials and retired

<HEADLINE> Israel Sets to Tackle Economic Slowdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli is taking measures to
remedy the economic slowdown, primarily the rising unemployment,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is setting up a national
economic council to tackle the issue.
</P>
<P>
The new council will comprise top officials from the Bank of
Israel, the ministries of finance, industry and trade, labor and
social affairs, as well as the Manufacturers Association and the
Histadrut (Labor Federation).
</P>
<P>
The radio said Netanyahu announced Monday that the council will
meet for the first time this week, and he will present new
measures dealing with the economic situation at the next cabinet
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The plan to set up the council came at a time when the
government released one discouraging data after another on the
economy recently.
</P>
<P>
A senior member of the Manufacturers Association predicted
Sunday that the economy in Israel will grow by only 1.1 percent in
1998, the lowest growth rate since 1966.
</P>
<P>
This echoed a prediction early June by the Economist
Intelligence Unit which said the Asian crisis, the continuing
slump in tourism and a steep fall in investment will push the
economic growth in Israel this year down to a 32-year low.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest data released by the Central Bureau of
Statistics, unemployment rate hit a five-year high of 9.3 percent
in May. Meanwhile, experts said this trend of steadily rising
jobless rate will not reverse itself soon.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Yaacov Neeman, who has been under fire for
the government's economic policy, said his ministry has been
working for weeks in a bid to find a solution to rising
unemployment. He insisted the government would continue allowing
the private sector to develop and grow and to serve as an engine
for the whole economy.
</P>
<P>
Under criticism that its high interest, low inflation policy
should be blamed for the lingering economic slowdown and rising
unemployment, the Bank of Israel, the central bank, announced late
July that it will cut interest rates by another 0.3 percentage
point in August to 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
Since inflation has been kept at a relatively low level of 4
percent, the Bank of Israel has cut the interest rates seven times
in months. Altogether, the rates have fallen by 2.4 percentage
points since the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
But Neeman stressed that to maintain the stability of the
Israeli currency, the shekel, the interest rates could not be
slashed too quickly.
</P>
<P>
Not everyone, however, has confidence in the new economic
council. Maxim Levy, member of the parliament's Labor and Social
Affairs Committee, said that similar councils had been set up in
the past, but they did not help.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese meteorologist said
today that this year's second tropical storm, expected to hit land
in China's southeast coastal regions within the next two days,
will quite likely have some negative influence on the flood
control efforts in the lower and middle reaches of the Yangtze
River.
</P>
<P>
"We're not as yet able to pinpoint exactly where the typhoon
will hit. However, a landing in provinces such as Jiangsu or
Zhejiang would create greater problems for Yangtze flood control
efforts," said Tang Huifang, vice-president of the Central
Meteorological Station.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed source from the State Flood Control and Drought
Relief Headquarters said the Yangtze River enbankment, which flood
waters have thoroughly saturated and eroded for over a month, is
now facing a growing threat of breaches.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the flood control situation along the Yangtze
remains extremely serious, and will remain so for the foreseeable
future, according to the source.
</P>
<P>
He said reports indicated the threat of some 3,200 breaches
along the Yangtze, including 1,800 major breaches. Fortunately,
major disasters have thus far been avoided,
</P>
<P>
The latest report from the State Flood Control and Drought
Relief Headquarters indicates that heavy rain in southwest China's
Sichuan Province and Chongqing Municipality on August 2 caused
flooding along the Minjiang and Wujiang rivers, both of which are
tributaries of the Yangtze. The flooding also resulted in slowing
rising water levels in thee upper reaches of the Yangtze.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Some 212 former members of the
law enforcement departments have been removed from their posts for
unethical or illegal conduct.
</P>
<P>
The major shake-up represents an educational and reorganization
move on the part of the Ministry of Justice to check injustices in
prisons and correctional institutes, and unethical practices
involving lawyers, notaries and grass roots legal service units,
as well as legal departments
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,146 cases have been reported in 17 provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities, with investigations carried
out on 738 cases and 75 people prosecuted for misconduct.
</P>
<P>
The leadership reorganization has been carried out in legal
departments at all levels, with improvements in rules, regulations
and management mechanisms, and strengthened supervision introduced
to future corruption.
</P>
<P>
The recent move by the Ministry of Justice is viewed as another
major government endeavor to curb rampant corruption.
</P>
<P>
Unethical and illegal behavior in law enforcement has been the
focus of public outrage in recent years, as evidenced by the fact
that the issue ranks as one of the major complaints tabled during
the annual sessions of the National People's Congress, China's top
legislature.

<P>
KHARTOUM, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese government
unilaterally declared a ceasefire with rebels in southern Sudan on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The truce will start on Tuesday, said a government statement,
but without mentioning the duration of the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the ceasefire was announced "to contain the
humanitarian situation in southern Sudan," where at least 1
million people are facing starvation.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came on the eve of negotiations between the
warring parties in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia with an aim to end the
15-year-old civil war.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese People's Liberation Army led by John Garang is now
the only rebel group continuing fighting the government for
autonomy of the predominantly Christian and animist region from the
Muslim north. In April last year, six rebel factions signed a
peace treaty with the government to end their armed struggle.
</P>
<P>
At least 1.5 million people have died since the insurgence
started in 1983.
</P>
<P>
There are about 2.6 million people in southern Sudan suffering
from lack of food. Fighting and drought are making the situation
worse.

During the meeting in the Presidential Palace, Estrada said it

<P>
"We intend to maintain good relations with the Philippine
government should this agreement not be successful. Our
relationship falls well beyond the agreement," he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Khatami's First Year in Office Features </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Treading a rough and thorny path,
Iran's moderate President Mohammad Khatami on Monday completed his
first year of office marked with diplomatic successes as well as
domestic political setbacks.
</P>
<P>
When the liberal-minded Khatami sworn in as the president, high
hopes were pinned on him to bring the Islamic Gulf state out of
long years of its enstrangement from the world.
</P>
<P>
Khatami did not let his people down. His government's focus on
detente with the rest of the world and the rule of law inside the
country has won compliments from both home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Distancing from the hard-line stance of his predecessors,
Khatami based his foreign policy the principles of removing
tensions with other countries, developing bilateral relations on
the basis of mutual respect and strengthening peace and stability
in the region as well as the world.
</P>
<P>
The overture of detente not only convinced the neighboring
countries, the Gulf states in particular, to remove long-running
misunderstandings to open the way for friendly cooperation, but
also was welcomed by Tehran's sworn enemy, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Following the successful Islamic summit in Tehran last
December, Arab countries, led by Egypt and Saudi Arabia, extended
their hands to Iran and agreed to sink their old feuds to usher in
a new era of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Iran's longtime foe Iraq also agreed to accelerate the pace of
solving the remaining issues left over from the 1980-88 bloody war
between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
European nations, putting aside their concerns about Iran's
stands on terrorism, the Middle East peace process, human rights
and weapons of mass destruction, rushed to Tehran to examine
opportunities of investment.
</P>
<P>
Most notably, the U.S. also waved olive branches to Tehran for
a possible reapproachment after nearly 20 years of
confrontation. In a positive sign, the exchange of visits by
sports people was regarded as a prelude to an end to the
two-decade hostility between them.
</P>
<P>
Back home, Khatami's liberal reforms have not gone as smoothly
as expected due to the strong resistance from the powerful
conservatives who dominate the judiciary and the society.
</P>
<P>
His slogan of "rule of law" and policy of granting more
personal freedom to the people has been denounced as an attempt to
undermine the Islamic rule and values.
</P>
<P>
The first major setback was the impeachment of his leading
supporter Abdollah Nouri as the interior minister by the
conservative-dominated Mjalis (Parliament) in June.
</P>
<P>
The imprisonment of the liberal Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein
Karbaschi by the court for alleged corruption was another blow
against Khatami in an intensified battle between the two camps.
</P>
<P>
Despite the setbacks, Khatami has scored points by successively
selling the idea of "rule of law" to his people, which has been
accepted by nearly all political factions -- in public at least.
</P>
<P>
And Khatami's reformist policies enjoy considerable support
among the society, the youths in particular, who endorse his
outlooks on political and social developments.
</P>
<P>
On the economic front, a continued fall in world oil prices had
cornered the heavily oil-dependent Iran. But Khatami is striving
to manage a way out, announcing a rehabilitation plan on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The plan is widely regarded as an indication that Khatami's
focus for the coming years will be on economic reform and
development.
</P>
<P>
However, observers said, the conservatives would be well in
Khatami's way so long as he keeps the reforms on, a harbinger of
further ups and downs, if not successes and setbacks, for the
president.

<HEADLINE> Units Pledge to Reinforce Anti-Smuggling Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- China's People's Liberation Army
(PLA), armed police units and public security departments have
vowed to fully support the recent central authorities' decision to
intensify anti-smuggling efforts nationwide, and to cease all
commercial activities in line with Party and government
requirements.
</P>
<P>
The PLA General Staff Headquarters and General Political,
Logistics and Armament Departments recently convened a meeting to
discuss army's role in the nation's anti-smuggling campaign.
</P>
<P>
Officers attending the meeting agreed that important and urgent
tasks center on expanding the battle against smuggling and banning
the military and armed police units from engaging in commercial
activities.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that the PLA, a solid foundation for the
people's democratic dictatorship in China, should resolutely
battle smuggling and play an exemplary role for society.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they noted that the common aspiration of all soldiers
and officers in the PLA and armed police units is to cease
involvement in all commercial activities which have without a
doubt had a negative impact on military management.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Security recently issued a circular
requiring bureaus and departments across the country, especially
those in the coastal and border regions, to give the highest
priority to the battle against smuggling, and to make every effort
to solve major smuggling cases and severely punish smugglers.
</P>
<P>
Greater efforts should also focus on the smuggling of drugs,
guns and ammunition, counterfeit currency and cultural relics, and
traffic control departments should improve management to ensure
that no smuggled vehicles obtain licenses, according to the
circular.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Security also instructed officials with
ll bureaus and departments to conscientiously comply with the ban
on any commercial activities by the army and police.
</P>
<P>
It also prohibits the future establishment of new companies
affiliated with public security departments, and requires all
existing ventures to operate in strict accordance with central
authorities' requirements.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Speaker Calls for Strong Central Organ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Speaker Dawit
Yohannes said Monday a revitalized central organ with stronger
mandate and broader policy options must continue to guide
Africans in monitoring and responding to its crisis.
</P>
<P>
Opening the 10th annual conference of the African Society of
International and Comparative Law here, Dawit said "our
collective political will and aspiration must manifest itself in
stronger political action."
</P>
<P>
"To that end, the prevention of armed conflicts must dictate
our organization's highest goal, deepest commitment and greatest
ambition," the speaker said.
</P>
<P>
To find so many of Africa's people languishing in abject
poverty when Africa stand poised to enter the next millennium is
not only unacceptable, but also dangerous, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to him, peace, democracy, good governance and
respect for human rights cannot flourish amongst human tragedy
and suffering.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Anatone Thendrebeogo, assistant secretary general
of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), expressed OAU's
support for the success of the conference on behalf of OAU
Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim.
</P>
<P>
The OAU would continue its efforts to solve the conflicts of
the continent, improve injustice and promote human rights,
democracy and good governance.
</P>
<P>
A message by the U.N. Chief Kofi Annan said regional practices
provide a valid basis for the codification and progressive
development of international law at the international level.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference will be devoted to the analysis of
the achievement and prospect of the OAU at its 35th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
The conference will also focus on topics such as political
achievements, peacekeeping, conflict prevention, human rights,
economic integration and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The African Society of International and Comparative Law is a
non-governmental organization in the region which was established
in 1986.

<HEADLINE> Teen Girls Fight Fat Through Smoking: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Teenaged girls frequently use
smoking to try to control their weight, according to a
British-Canadian study published Monday.
</P>
<P>
Schoolgirls smoke not simply to be cool, but to be thin, the
research indicates. Cigarettes are seen as a weapon to fight
pubescent bulge.
</P>
<P>
The study assessed body weight and smoking habits in 2,768
girls aged 10 to 17 in Ottawa and in London, England, and its
findings partly explain why girls are even more resistant than
teenaged boys to pressures to quit smoking.
</P>
<P>
"Those forces that drive the female desire to be thin are very
powerful: They certainly override the prospect of death coming a
few years earlier some decades hence," said lead researcher Arthur
Crisp, a psychiatrist with Atkinson Morley's Hospital in
Wimbledon, England.
</P>
<P>
"They're not going to give it up just because we tell them it's
harmful for them," Crisp said.
</P>
<P>
The study examined responses by 1,936 British girls and 832
Canadian girls to questions related to smoking, alcohol
consumption, moods, weight changes, eating habits, menstruation
and attitudes concerning body weight and shape.
</P>
<P>
Crisp, who worked with researchers at Ottawa General Hospital
and Royal Ottawa Hospital, found striking similarities between
girls on both sides of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
Both groups gave a nearly identically ranked order of reasons
for smoking and the consequences of giving it up. They listed
smoking as a substitute for eating and as a relaxing, enjoyable
activity that curbs appetite.
</P>
<P>
They also reported that if they gave up smoking they would eat
more and gain more weight. But they expressed very little anxiety
or concern about smoking itself.
</P>
<P>
Reports suggest teenaged girls now account for the greatest
increases in overall teenage smoking and offer insight into the
climbing rate of lung cancer among women.

<HEADLINE> Tourism Earns South Africa Record Income in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 3 (Xinhua) -- International tourism had
earned South Africa more than 20 billion Rand (3.3 billion U.S.
Dollars) in foreign exchange last year, a new record in the
sector, Environment and Tourism Minister Pallo Jordan said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
This substantially contributed to South Africa's balance of
payments and to overall economic growth and job creation, South
African Press Association quoted Jordan as saying at a briefing
in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
World Trade Organization (WTO) figures showed that South
Africa's tourism growth rate was the world's second highest last
year, and the country ranked 26th as the world's favorite tourism
destination, he said.
</P>
<P>
The total number of international visitors to South Africa had
exceeded 5.4 million, Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 600,000 people were directly employed in the
country's tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
While South Africa had made some achievement in upgrading
international airports and enlarging room capacity of hotels, the
country's inadequate tourism marketing budget and worrying
security record are hampering its tourism development, Jordan
said.

<HEADLINE> China Vows to Strengthen Economic Ties, Trade With Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- China has given top priority to
Sino-African economic relations and trade of equality and mutual
benefit, State Councillor Wu Yi said today at the opening ceremony
of the China-Africa Seminar for Economic and Management Officials.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, hosted by China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) and Foreign Ministry, is the first
of its kind and was created by the suggestion of Chinese President
Jiang Zemin. It will be held twice a year for economic officials
of African countries.
</P>
<P>
Wu welcomed the 22 participants from 12 countries attending the
seminar, saying she aimed to inform participants about China's
basic situation, introduce each other to their own countries, and
deepen mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the first seminar were from Egypt, Eritrea,
Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Sudan,
Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
China places importance on the development of sincere and
friendly relations with Africa of equality, mutual benefit and
cooperation, Wu Yi said.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to strive with all African countries to
develop a long-term, stable relationship of comprehensive
cooperation oriented toward the 21st century, she said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of China-Africa economic relations and trade, she said
the Chinese government has always valued its commercial ties with
African countries. Both Chinese leaders who have visited Africa
and leaders of African countries who have visited China promised
to give top priority to foster economic and commercial cooperation
of equality and mutual benefit, she said.
</P>
<P>
Trade between China and Africa has continued to grow in recent
years. Records show that the trade volume was 5.67 billion
U.S. dollars in 1997, up 40.6 percent over the previous year, and
six times the 1990 figure. The volume for the first six months of
this year reached 2.859 billion U.S. dollars, rising 12 percent,
including a 44 percent increase in exports. Various channels, ways
and multi-levels appeared in the bilateral trade ties, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Growth of its trade with Africa created very favorable
conditions for further development of bilateral trade ties, which
still has a large potential, she said.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to join hands with African countries, and to
strive to upgrade China-Africa commercial ties to a new height,
she said.
</P>
<P>
Shi Guangsheng, the MOFTEC minister, also delivered a speech at
the ceremony. He said that during the seminars Chinese
governmental officials and experts are expected to introduce to
the participants China's way of economic development, its economic
structural reforms, and policies and initiatives in all fields
since reforms and opening-up began, especially the policies of
attracting foreign investment and strengthening economic ties and
trade with Africa.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, participants will exchange information on the status
and experience of economic development in their own countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will also organize the participants
touring China for investigation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Foreign Minister Ji Peiding and diplomatic envoys of
relevant African countries also attended today's ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Ung Huot Urges Cambodians to Respect People's Will </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian First Prime Minister
Ung Huot on Monday asked Cambodians "not to create problems" but
to respect the people's will following last Sunday's election.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at his residence, Ung Huot said
he would hand over power if his Reastr Niyum (Populism) Party
failed in the election.
</P>
<P>
Initial results showed that Ung Huot's party, failing to pocket
enough votes, would not have any seat in the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Ung Huot vowed to "respect the will of the people" himself and
called on Cambodians to "put the national interests above
everything else".
</P>
<P>
He said he has decided to "conditionally" accept the results
pending investigations into alleged vote frauds.
</P>
<P>
"I will accept the final result after the investigation and
verification by the National Election Committee (NEC)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ung Huot's party was among those calling for a probe into
"irregularities" which were said to have influenced the election
outcome.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP), an apparent winner
of the polls, has named the current co-premier Hun Sen as prime
minister of Cambodia's next coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Ung Huot replaced his predecessor Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who
was ousted by Hun Sen in July last year.
</P>
<P>
Making his first public remark following the election, Ung Huot
voiced his hope that Cambodia, under the new government, would
have its seat in the United Nations restored and join the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN indefinitely postponed Cambodia's admission following
the ouster of Ranariddh, and Cambodia's UN seat has remained
vacant ever since.
</P>
<P>
The first prime minister also denied press reports that he had
fled to Australia after the election, saying that he had been in
Cambodia before, during and after the election.

</P>
<P>
Speaking at a work conference on learning Deng Xiaoping Theory,

</P>
<P>
"We must help Party members realize that Deng Xiaoping Theory
is a great banner for progress...and more profound studies of the
theory will provide a fundamental guarantee for achieving
trans-century goals and promoting reform, development and
stability. Studies will also serve as the key for training
qualified Party member cadres and ensuring that departments
faithfully perform important duties," said Wu.

Representatives from a number of departments recounted their
experiences in learning Deng Xiaoping Theory and its application
to their work at the conference.

<P>
NEW DELHI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Militants shot dead Monday at
least 31 people and wounded 14 in two separate incidents in remote
areas of Chamba district of Himachal Pradesh, north India, the
Press Trust of India reported.
</P>
<P>
The militants, armed with automatic weapons, swooped on
mud-built hut housing road construction laborers while they were
asleep at around 03:00 local time at a place called Kalabanh and
showered bullets on them, killing 26 on the spot.
</P>
<P>
The firing left 11 wounded, two of whom trudged to the nearest
police station to report the incident, PTI said, quoting police.
</P>
<P>
In another incident, PTI said, militants shot dead five people
including a police constable and injured three at Satrandi, about
20 km from Kalabanh, Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
The killing in Chamba came a week after militants suspected to
be of the banned Hizbul Mujaheedin shot dead 17 Hindus in two
villages of adjoining Doda district of Jammu and Kashmir on July
28.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said Monday's killings in Himachal could be
the handwork of militants belonging to the outfit which was
responsible for the gunning down on July 28.

</P>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- After reading a recent newspaper
report on the draft revision to the law on the organization of
village committees, Yao Yuan, a Shanghai engineer, immediately
contemplated writing to the top legislature which is
soliciting opinions from the general public.
</P>
<P>
However, Yao refrained from doing so since he is neither a
villager nor a legal expert.
</P>
<P>
"A short time later, I watched a TV news report on Li
Peng's fact-finding tour in the northeast, and was once again
determined to write the letter," said Yao.
</P>
<P>
His letter was one of 452 responses the Legislative Affairs
Committee under the National People's Congress Standing Committee
received last month.
</P>
<P>
Most of the contributors were farmers, village leaders, county
and township government officials, legal experts and ordinary
citizens like Yao.
</P>
<P>
Provincial legislatures expect to receive even more responses
over the next few weeks, according to Zhang Chunshen, deputy
director of the Legislative Affairs Committee. He added that the
Civil Affairs Ministry also received several hundred related
responses.
</P>
<P>
China's 900 million farmers consider the law on the
organization of village committees their "guarantee for autonomy
in village affairs." However, a senior Chinese legislator noted
that the law is "sketchy" and requires refinements and amendments
in terms of application procedures needed to improve village
democracy.

country's political reform is also advancing to the countryside,"
an expert from the rural community research center said in his
letter, noting that the ongoing change in the countryside is of
far-reaching significance.

the operation of the new Hong Kong International Airport since it
was appointed on July 21.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Merapi Volcano Continues to Show Signs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's most active volcano
in Central Java, Mount Merapi, was continuing to show visible
signs of activity with its danger status still one rung below the
highest alert level, Antara News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hot clouds, lava and volcanic ashes had lately also emanated
from the volcano's crater, threatening the lives of people living
on its western and southwestern slopes, Head of the Center for
Research and Development of Volcanic Technology Mas Atje
Purbawinata said.
</P>
<P>
Residents of areas closest to the mountain had been told to
remain alert to any possible emergency as volcanic materials were
continuing to emerge on the mountain's top, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, people in the same areas were now also being
endangered by cold lava floods caused by rains that have been
falling almost continuously in the past few days, he added.
</P>
<P>
The 2,968-meter Merapi erupted on July 11, spilling out hot
fumes and ashes and its conditions have prompted local authorities
to maintain a "Merapi alert" state of readiness.
</P>
<P>
Sixty people were killed when Merapi erupted without warning in
November 1994, while in January last year 8,000 people were
evacuated when it poured out hot gas, ashes and lava.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Appeals to Gordon to Step Down Peacefully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada appealed anew Monday to former Subic Bay Metropolitan
Chairman Richard Gordon to "step down peacefully."
</P>
<P>
Despite Gordon's continued defiance, Estrada said he has
ordered peacekeeping forces in the freeport to continue exercising
maximum tolerance in dealing with Gordon's supporters.
</P>
<P>
The president renewed his appeal to Gordon's good sense as the
Court of Appeals gave the government and Gordon three days to wrap
up their respective arguments.
</P>
<P>
Estrada charged that Gordon has been resisting a legal order by
the president but still the government will not resort to
violence.
</P>
<P>
It was regrettable, Estrada said, that Gordon's clinging to his
post has led to skirmishes between government forces and his
supporters that cost the life of one person and sent 22 policemen
to hospital with serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
Gordon has served the office for six years. After he failed to
win the May 11 presidential elections, Estrada, who assumed office
on June 30, appointed Felicito Payumo the new Subic Bay
Metropolitan Chairman.
</P>
<P>
Payumo said he has made it clear to the president that he would
vacate his post as soon as the court hands down a ruling in favor
of Gordon.
</P>
<P>
He also assured the president that he would not fall into the
trap set by Gordon who had been allegedly provoking him to use
force against his supporters.
</P>
<P>
But he added that Gordon's alleged supporters are actually
hired hooligans who were engaged to sabotage operations in Subic.
</P>
<P>
Subic was transferred into a freeport and a special economic
zone after U.S. troops withdrew from the naval base in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Flood Victims Spend Tranquil Night on Dike in Hunan Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANXIANG (HUNAN), August 3 (Xinhua) -- Lying on the dike
surrounded by floodwaters, thousands of farmers who were forced to
flee their homes are spending another night filled with
expectation.
</P>
<P>
Although nine days have passed, most of the flood victims are
not accustomed to their changed living environment. The dike,
serving as their temporary shelter, is covered by tents and
discarded disposable styrofoam fast food containers and plastic
bags.
</P>
<P>
Without adequate food and drinking water, the flood victims can
do nothing but wait for the retreat of the floodwaters and the
assistance of the government.
</P>
<P>
"Despite having no homes, we have no anxiety at all since there
are the government and the People's Liberation Army," said Zhang
Xuezhen, from Huizimiao Village of Anxiang County in central Hunan
Province.
</P>
<P>
Since late June, the water level of Dongting Lake in Hunan has
risen dramatically because of serious flooding on the Yangtze
River. Threatened by record high water, a section of the dike in
Anxiang was breached on July 24. More than 100,000 villagers
nearby lost their homes overnight.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, 63, said she had never experienced such a serious
flood. She joined two other families in cooking meals and took
part in the night patrol organized by the village authorities to
prevent thefts from the submerged houses.
</P>
<P>
To prevent an epidemic, the local hospital set up a temporary
medical service station every two kilometers along the dike, with
nearly 100 doctors ready to offer medical treatment around the
clock.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jun, a doctor on duty, said he and two colleagues today
treated more than 100 flood victims, most suffering from colds and
diarrhea. "Our biggest wish is that the cracked section of the
dike could be repaired as soon as possible so that the victims can
return and reconstruct their homes," he said.
</P>
<P>
The scene on the dike was tranquil, except for the sound of an
occasional truck passing by loaded with relief supplies.
</P>
<P>
At the site of the cracked dike, several thousand local
officials and PLA soldiers were busy repairing the cracked areas.

<HEADLINE> Djibouti Offers to Be Used by Malaysia as Gateway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Djibouti Monday offered
Malaysia to use the African country as a gateway to a huge East
African market of some 130 million people.
</P>
<P>
Djibouti saw this as another way to increase bilateral trade
and investment between the two countries, Malaysian Foreign
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi told reporters after a bilateral
delegation meeting between Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and
Djibouti President Hassan Gouled Aptidon here.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said, "Malaysia will send a ministerial level
delegation to the country to have a closer look on this and other
trade and investment opportunities there."
</P>
<P>
The ministers of transport as well as for international trade
and industry would be going to Djibouti for the purpose as
Monday's discussions involved mainly opportunities in the two
sectors, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Djibouti president, who arrived here Sunday for a nine-day
state visit, expressed his country's willingness to provide
various incentives to Malaysian investors in the area of petroleum
industry, telecommunications, banking and light industries,
Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
Djibouti has asked Malaysia to help the country set up a free
trade zone to further develop its economy and wanted Malaysia's
help to modernize and develop its various sectors such as
infrastructure, agriculture, power generation, port and airport
services, the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
"But the prime minister said that we are currently facing with
economic problems and as such there could be difficulties to
involve in a big way," Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
He said Mahathir had offered economic-related training programs
to Djibouti especially in the field of management and port
management.
</P>
<P>
At present, nine students from the republic are studying at the
International Islamic University in Petaling Jaya near here.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Malaysia and Djibouti Monday signed two agreements,
one on promotion and protection of investment, and the other on
economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia was represented by Abdullah and International Trade
and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz while Djibouti by Minister of
Commerce and Industry Mohamed Barkat Abdillahi for both
agreements.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Korean Project on Oil Tanker Conversion Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The conversion of a Brazilian oil
supertanker has been successfully finished with the joint efforts
of the Shanhaiguan Shipyard in north China and Hyundai Heavy
Industries Co. Ltd. of the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
The supertanker, known as Jose Bonifacio and with
270,000 dead-weight tons, has been re-equipped with a floating,
production, storage and off-loading system (FPSOs). Shanhaiguan
Shipyard and Hyundai converted a similar oil tanker in February.
</P>
<P>
The re-equipment of FPSOs, a very complicated task that requires
the use of high technology, prepares an oil tanker for integrated
tasks of drilling, processing, storing, and off-loading of sea
petroleum.
</P>
<P>
The newly converted tanker, built in 1974, is 337.7 meters
long, 54.5 meters wide, and 28 meters high. It will be operating
on the Marine Sea offshore from Brazil, with a daily production
capacity of 500,000 barrels of crude oil and two million cubic
meters of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1972 and located near the Qinghuangdao Port, the
Shanhaiguan Shipyard is one of the leading shipyards in China.

<HEADLINE> Survey Uncovers Unqualified Domestic Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- A survey published today shows a
slight improvement in the general quality of domestic products,
but also indicates serious problems with regard to certain products.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which covered 2,533 types of products manufactured
in 1,904 enterprises, was conducted by the State Quality and
Technology Supervision Bureau in the second quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that 77.8 percent of products are up to the
state standards, up 1.3 percent on the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
However, the qualification rates for products from small
state-owned enterprises in machine building, medical appliances
and various other light industries were comparatively low.
</P>
<P>
Experts noted that outdated ways of management, slow upgrades
of products and the neglect of quality standards represent major
causes for low product quality of many enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In addition, various quality problems were listed for wheat flour
and certain types of agricultural machinery.
</P>
<P>
The bureau has instructed quality supervision departments at
all levels to tighten controls and order enterprises which failed
to pass quality tests to institute immediate improvements. It also
called for an immediate ban on the production and marketing of low
quality and counterfeit products.

<HEADLINE> Nepal, Bhutan to Hold Ministerial Talks on Refugee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Girija
Prasad Koirala said here Monday that Nepal and Bhutan will soon
resume ministerial talks on the refugee problem.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the press at the airport upon arrival from
Singapore, Koirala said that during their talks on the sidelines
of the South Asia summit in Colombo, Sri Lanka, he told Chairman
of Bhutanese Council of Ministers Jigme Thinley that "if small
nations can solve their problem, then they can maintain their
identity in the present international context."
</P>
<P>
This time the attitude of the Bhutanese side was positive, he
added.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 Bhutanese refugees are staying in eight U.N.-run
camps in eastern Nepal after being forced to flee Bhutan in 1989
and the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
"Refugees can reach everywhere and can do everything when their
problems are not resolved," Koirala said.
</P>
<P>
Nepal and Bhutan have held seven rounds of ministerial talks on
the issue, but to no avail. India has refused to get involved in
the issue, saying it is a bilateral matter.
</P>
<P>
On the sidelines of the 10th summit of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) held on July 29-31,
Koirala also discussed the refugee issue with Indian Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in addition to bilateral issues.
</P>
<P>
Koirala said that the attitude of his Indian counterpart was
positive as well.
</P>
<P>
On the 10th SAARC summit, he said that the summit has shown
that SAARC can play a significant role in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
"The dispute between India and Pakistan created much commotion
at the SAARC conference and doubts arose about the significance of
SAARC itself," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We stuck to the view that bilateral issues should not
undermine the importance of SAARC and the conference went ahead in
a congenial atmosphere," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the 11th SAARC summit will be held in Nepal at the end
of October or beginning of November 1999.
</P>
<P>
After attending the 10th SAARC summit, Koirala paid a private
visit to Singapore before returning home.

HONG KONG, August 3 (Xinhua) -- A heat spell has haunted Hong
Kong for the past several days with a maximum temperature hitting
34.4 degrees Celsius Monday, the highest so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Local observatory said temperatures over the northern parts of

<HEADLINE> Indian Congress Party Attacks Government's Handling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Congress party
Monday attacked the handling of foreign policy by the government
led by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as a "complete failure",
resulting in "total isolation" of the country following the
nuclear tests in May.
</P>
<P>
Initiating a special discussion Monday on the recent
developments affecting India's foreign policy in Lok Sabha, the
Upper House of Parliament, senior Congress leader P. A. Sangma
said the country was facing "isolation" internationally and
lamented that the BJP-led coalition still has no foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Though Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee described his talks
with his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif last week in Colombo,
Sri Lanka, as "cordial and constructive", Sangma said, Sharif
dismissed the talks as a "waste of time".
</P>
<P>
Stating that India has not been able to carry conviction with
the so-called key interlocutors after the nuclear tests, Sangma
said it was due to the "inconsistency between our call for
disarmament and our nuclear tests and weaponization".
</P>
<P>
Other factors were that there was inconsistency between the
nuclear tests and the image and reality of India as a land of
poverty, malnutrition and unemployment, he said.
</P>
<P>
National security could not be preserved, protected and
enhanced due to the nuclear tests and it could not be achieved
without security in various other fields like food, job and
health, said Sangma, former speaker of the Indian Parliament.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Criticizes Butler for Working in Old Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraq Monday criticized U.N. chief
arms inspector Richard Butler for continuing his old working style
in dealing with its weapons issues, saying the ongoing talks would
not yield good results.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with Butler, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz said he had told Butler that "I am not surprised to know that
you are still working in the same old style, though you promised
in our last meeting that the work program we agreed upon would be
honestly and swiftly implemented."
</P>
<P>
Aziz and Butler reached an agreement in June on a two-month
program of work for weapons inspections. Butler told a press
conference held after the conclusion of the agreement that the
light at the end of the tunnel for Iraq was more visible than
before.
</P>
<P>
Butler arrived here on Sunday for a three-day visit. He and
Aziz held the first round of talks Monday on missile warheads,
indigenous production and the biological file. They will start the
second round of talks in the evening.
</P>
<P>
The way the United Nations Special Commission, or UNSCOM,
worked last month was the same of ignoring essential issues of
disarmament while focusing on minor and insignificant issues to
waste time, prolong work and distort the picture of the situation,
Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM is charged with overseeing the elimination of Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
It must certify that Iraq has destroyed the long-range missiles
and nuclear, chemical and biological weapons before the U.N.
Security Council can lift the crippling economic sanctions imposed
on Iraq in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
"The manner in which UNSCOM teams worked were neither honest
nor swift. In fact they were games and maneuvers intended for
prolongation and distortion," Aziz said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIDAIHE, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress, met
here today with a delegation of the Foreign Affairs Committee of
the Danish Parliament led by its chairwoman, Helle Degn.
</P>
<P>
Extending a warm welcome to the delegation, Li said he hoped
that the current visit would help Danish parliament members deepen
their understanding about China, and also strengthen cooperation
between the foreign affairs committees of the two parliaments.
</P>
<P>
At the request of his guests, Li introduced China's reform,
opening-up and economic construction after the 15th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Li told guests that China's target is to build socialism with
Chinese characteristics, and China is still a developing country
in the primary stage of socialism. During the past 20 years, he
said, China has emphasized proper handling of the relationship
between reform, development and stability, which is an important
experience.
</P>
<P>
According to the spirit of the 15th CPC National Congress,
China is implementing two basic strategies of invigorating the
country through science and education and achieving sustained
development, both keys to the modernization of the country, he
said.
</P>
<P>
On China's democratic system, Li said China exercises the
system of people's congresses and the system of multi-party
cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the

<HEADLINE> Cohen Optimistic About Manila's Ratification of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William S.
Cohen expressed his optimism here Monday that the Philippine
Senate will ratify the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) as it will
help Manila and Washington work in partnership for the stability
of the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
"The Visiting Forces Agreement is going to help the United
States and the Philippines work more closely together and I would
like to be clear on this point, the U.S. does not seek any bases
in the Philippines," Cohen told a press conference here after his
talks with Philippine Defense Secretary Orlando S. Mercado.
</P>
<P>
"What we want is an expanded mutual security relationship with
the Philippines. That is why our government supports the
agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen denied that his visit or that of U.S. State Secretary
Madeleine Albright last week was to pressure the Manila government
for the ratification of the VFA.
</P>
<P>
Albright was here last week for the ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) Regional Forum.
</P>
<P>
The focus of talks between the defense secretaries of the two
countries was the VFA, which is pending for ratification by the
Senate in the next few weeks, according to the Philippine News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that Mercado-Cohen talks touched on many topics
such as ways in which the Philippines and the U.S. could improve
their security relations and the stability of the Asia-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed the exchange of security dialogues between
Washington and most countries in Asia that includes training of
military personnel, it said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen also said that he discussed with his Filipino counterpart
other areas of mutual interests that include exercises, disaster
relief, and other subjects of mutual and regional interests.
</P>
<P>
"We also explored ways in which we could work together on
procurement (and) reform, something that I have been engaged on
for many years as member of the Senate," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the U.S. is sure that the Philippine Senate will
approve the VFA, Cohen said that there is a need to work hard.
</P>
<P>
"The prospects for approval are very good. But I think as a
former legislator myself, one never counts the votes until the
votes are finally in," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen also cited the commitment made by the Philippine
government to work hard for the ratification of the VFA.
</P>
<P>
Mercado, who in 1991 voted against the extension of the
Philippines-U.S. Military Bases Agreement (MBA), said that he is
supporting the ratification of the VFA.
</P>
<P>
Mercado explained that the VFA and the MBA are not the same
because the VFA only calls for a joint exercise between Filipino
and American troops on a periodic basis.
</P>
<P>
He said that he opposed the MBA because of the permanent
stationing of U.S. troops in the country and the VFA does not.
</P>
<P>
"We feel that these exercises will be of use and beneficial to
our country, especially now we are in a bind and unable to pursue
with gusto our modernization plan," Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who arrived here Sunday, also met with Philippine
President Joseph Estrada during the day.

<HEADLINE> Film on 7 Greatest places in World to be Shown in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 3 (Xinhua) -- A film that will take the
audience to seven of the planet's most obscure and awe-inspiring
natural wonders will start screening at the Hong Kong Space Museum
here Tuesday, according to the Provisional Urban Council.
</P>
<P>
The 38-minute film, "The Greatest Places" starts off from 250
million years ago when the planet's "super continent" begins
splitting apart, unleashing massive climatic powers across the
globe which greatly affect the places to this day.
</P>
<P>
The film then tours seven diversities of the Earth, from the
isolated island of Madagascar off the coast of Africa which has
bred an exotic assortment of wildlife including two thirds of the
world's species of chameleons, to a desert of Africa.
</P>
<P>
The audience will see on the impressive dome-shaped screen how
the massive movements of the Earth's crust create the world's
largest uplifted area of Tibet of China and experience the power
of the Iguazu Falls in South America, which has a total fall width
four times that of Niagara Falls.
</P>
<P>
Other wonders highlighted include the Amazon River in South
America, the world's largest river in terms of water mass; the
Okavango Delta in mid-Africa, Africa's largest oasis, and
Greenland, the largest island in the world where snow falls every
month of the year, testing the limits of human existence.
</P>
<P>
"No other movie of this sort that I know of shows as many
remote worldwide locations," film director Mal Wolfe said.
</P>
<P>
The film also helps viewers explore these locations by looking
at the wildlife, culture and people that define them.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government
announced Monday Minister for Education and Second Minister for
Defense Teo Chee Hean will visit Indonesia to present humanitarian
assistance.
</P>
<P>
Teo Chee Hean will lead a delegation of senior officials to
attend a handover ceremony that will take place at Indonesia's
Halim Airport to mark the first delivery of humanitarian aid to
the country, the government said in a press statement.
</P>
<P>
Teo Chee Hean will also make a courtesy call on Indonesian
President B. j. Habibie and a number of Indonesian cabinet
members, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The aid worth 12 million Singapore dollars (7 million U.S.
dollars) was announced on July 6 by the Singapore government.
</P>
<P>
A statement released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that
day said recognizing the hardships the current economic crisis has
caused Indonesia, the Singapore government "will be extending 12
million Singapore dollars worth of humanitarian assistance in rice
and medicines to the Indonesian people to help alleviate their
difficulties."
</P>
<P>
The statement also noted that the amount "is in addition to the
5 million Singapore dollars in humanitarian aid that the Singapore
Red Cross has announced."
</P>
<P>
After nearly a month of close consultation, officials from both
sides have worked out the details for the handover of the aid.
</P>
<P>
Under the handover plan, the aid will be delivered in three
separate shipments over the next few weeks. The first phase will
comprise 10,000 tons of rice and a supply of medicines and
subsequent shipments of aid will follow in the weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
The Navy and Air Force of Singapore will transport the aid
cargo to Indonesia by sea and air while the Indonesian armed

<HEADLINE> Experts Warn Use of Vitamins in Fight Against Heart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Vitamins could cause more harm
than good in the fight against heart disease, world leaders in
cardiac research said Monday in western Australia's coastal city
of Perth.
</P>
<P>
The warning came as cardiologists predicted developing nations
would be hardest hit as heart disease became the world's biggest
killer in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
David Harrison, a U.S. heart disease prevention expert, warned
vitamins, known as anti-oxidants and hailed in recent years as the
ultimate in heart disease prevention, could actually help cause
heart attacks and strokes.
</P>
<P>
"Stop taking anti-oxidant vitamins until there is much better
research. At least until current studies are completed in about
two years," Harrison, a globally recognized cardiologist, was
quoted Monday by the Australian Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Vitamins A, C and E have been sold by the medical community as
substances which eradicate harmful free radicals - highly active
cells which can inflame artery walls and promote cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
Harrison said there was still much research to be done on
anti-oxidant vitamins, but current results suggested after they
"scavenged" free radicals, anti-oxidants themselves could become
free radicals.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know for sure that anti-oxidants are good, if they
are bad, or if they have no effect at all," he told the Cardiac
Society of Australia and New Zealand's annual conference in Perth.
</P>
<P>
Naturally occurring anti-oxidants in fruit and vegetables were
the safe alternative to highly-concentrated vitamin pills,
Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
The health message came as world-renowned Canadian cardiologist
Salam Yusuf predicted by 2020, 75-80 percent of all heart attacks
and strokes would occur in third world nations.
</P>
<P>
"It is entirely lifestyle changes and environmental changes now
occurring in the developing countries, including increased use of
tobacco, increased urbanization with its stresses, increased
consumption of the wrong foods, decreased energy loss," he said.
</P>
<P>
An ever-intensifying push by tobacco companies in developing
nations could mean heart disease will increase far beyond Yusuf's
predictions.
</P>
<P>
"The single most important thing we can do in terms of
prevention of heart disease is tobacco control," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to better education about the risks of cigarette smoking
and the importance of a balanced diet, developed nations could
expect to see a continued decrease in heart disease deaths.

<HEADLINE> South African Mercenaries Join Angola Rebel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- A mercenary force of more
than 300 men, among them many South Africans, is joining the
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) in their
fight against government troops, local intelligence sources have
revealed.
</P>
<P>
The Star paper Monday quoted unidentified intelligence sources
as saying that most of those signed up are former members of the
military advisory organization of Executive Outcomes, who were
previously active in Angola and other African states as well as
in the Middle East and Papua New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Executive Outcomes, well-known for its mercenary business
abroad in the past, said last year it had closed down its
military operations ahead of new legislation passed by parliament
this year, which prohibits South Africans from offering freelance
military skills and services to foreign countries and companies.
</P>
<P>
The legislation makes provision for heavy fines, confiscation
of property and long prison sentences for mercenaries convicted
by local courts.
</P>
<P>
The South African government was reportedly aware of South
African mercenaries inside Angola. Last week, Defense Minister
Joe Modise said action would have to be taken to prevent South
African mercenaries and supplies reaching the UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the tense situation in Angola, Modise said: "We
will have to stop the trafficking of weapons and supplies to the
warring parties. There are rumours that supplies are coming from
this country and that our people are involved."
</P>
<P>
The mercenaries were reportedly signed up by a new, so far
unnamed security group with links to business interests in South
Africa, the United States, France and Britain.

<HEADLINE> China's Media Taking Watchdog Role in Courts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Live coverage of trials, a new
but popular practice in China, has enabled more Chinese to observe
and supervise the process of courtroom hearings which had been
secretive until only a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
Experts here pointed out that broadcasting trials live not only
provides the general public with a chance to supervise the
judicial departments, but also facilitates China's judges to
improve their professional skills.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Yang, president of the Supreme People's Court, expressed a
positive attitude toward the practice, saying that as long as the
media respects the facts and takes an impartial stand, live
coverage of trials is always welcome.
</P>
<P>
To date, more than 40 television stations across China have had
live court coverage, the first of which is the Nanjing City
Television Station in east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Since April 1, 1994, the station began the practice of live
coverage in a weekly program titled "Courtroom Fax" and, to date,
the program has shown more than 200 trials.
</P>
<P>
On July 11, 1998, China Central Television (CCTV), the
country's state-run television station, broadcast a courtroom
hearing live nationwide for the first time, which has sparked a
reaction among ordinary Chinese.
</P>
<P>
A number of television stations in China are reportedly
planning live court coverage as part of an effort to catch up with
their coastal counterparts.
</P>
<P>
"The primary objective of live coverage is to improve the legal
awareness of the general public," said an official in Jiangsu
Province.
</P>
<P>
The Nanjing City Television Station explicitly stipulates
that live broadcasting gives priority to those civil, economic and
administrative cases which the ordinary citizens care about most,
provided that those cases do not involve national security,
individuals' privacy or juvenile delinquents.
</P>
<P>
While experts and lawyers are invited to comment on the trials
being broadcast alive, hot lines are also prepared for the
audiences to air their opinions, the official said.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted in Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu Province,
shows that many local residents have an enormous interest in the
program and frequently ask their friends to record the program
when they can't afford the time to watch the trials.
</P>
<P>
"The objectivity of live coverage helps it win popularity,"
said Zhang Guoliang, director of the Social Education Department
of the station.

<HEADLINE> Memorial Service Held for Taiwanese died in Haicheng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 3 (Xinhua) -- A memorial service was held
Sunday for Lin Ti-chuan, a Taiwanese who died recently in
Haicheng, a city in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Lin's parents, relatives and close friends came here on Sunday
to handle the funeral affairs. Lin died after she was reportedly
kidnapped and illegally detained because of an economic dispute.
</P>
<P>
The local government helped arrange a memorial hall for
Lin. The relevant departments, including the associations of
Taiwan-funded enterprises of Dalian and Haicheng cities as well as
the Liaoning Provincial Federation of Taiwan Compatriots,
presented flower baskets and elegiac couplets.
</P>
<P>
Lin's picture was hung in the center of a wall covered by lily
flowers. Fresh flowers and fruit were placed before her picture.
</P>
<P>
Before going to the memorial hall, a Master of the Law who came
specially from Taiwan carried out rituals for Ms. Lin at the place
where she was illegally detained, according to Taiwan's customs.
</P>
<P>
Upon leaving the memorial hall after the memorial service,
Lin's parents requested the incense in the hall be kept burning
until they left Haicheng. Local officials promised to fulfill
their wish since the people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits
are linked each other by flesh and blood.
</P>
<P>
Lin's father expressed his gratitude to the local government
for its support and help in handling the funeral affairs.

<HEADLINE> Half-Year Crime Rate Up in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Statistics released by the
police Monday showed the crime rate went up by 4.7 percent in
Singapore for the first half of this year with an across-the-board
increase in crime figures.
</P>
<P>
The statistics came after Minister for Home Affairs Wong Kan
Seng revealed at a general meeting of the National Crime
Prevention Council Friday that 23,844 crime cases were recorded in
the first half of this year, 1,073 more than the 22,811 in the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, the highest increase was recorded
for crimes such as snatch theft, car theft and motor vehicle
break-ins.
</P>
<P>
Cases of snatch theft was a jump of more than 55 percent, while
car theft and motor vehicle break-ins increased by more than 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
Murder cases, rape, housebreaking and robberies also increased,
registering 12 more murder cases against the same period last
year, a 30 percent increase in rape cases and a marginal rise in
housebreaking and robbery cases.
</P>
<P>
However, there was an almost 12 percent drop in rioting, and a
decrease in the number of outrage of modesty cases.
</P>
<P>
At Friday's meeting Wong Kan Seng said "although the overall
figure is no cause for alarm, we are still concerned."
</P>
<P>
"The police have spared no effort in combating crime, but the
public must continue to do their part as well," he added.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner of Police Khoo Boon Hui said on another occasion
that the police have focused their efforts on those crimes that
have increased significantly and on arresting serial offenders in
order to better tackle the situation.

<HEADLINE> New Technology Developed to Recreate Crime Scenes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- In what Australian police
claimed to be a world first, visual crime scenes will be recreated
in the courtroom following computer technology developments by
police experts in Australia's Queensland state.
</P>
<P>
They have developed a way to allow judges, jurors and witnesses
to "walk through a crime scene" and examine fingerprints and
forensic evidence, without setting foot in the real-life site.
</P>
<P>
The new technology, Interactive Crime Scene Recording System,
digitally combines the hundreds of photographs taken at a crime
scene to create a 360 degree view of the area, allowing it to be
examined from any angle.
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm aware, we're the only police service in the
world to have taken this (system) on board," Acting Deputy
Commissioner Ron McGibbon told the Australian Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
The technology had the potential to cut back the crime scene
paperwork swamping courtrooms, and present the same information in
a simple and compact computer presentation.
</P>
<P>
"I believe it will revolutionize the way we introduce evidence
in court," said Senior Sergeant Adrian Freeman, one of the
system's designers.
</P>
<P>
The system, developed over two years, has been demonstrated
successfully overseas and "is rapidly being adopted as an industry
standard", he said.
</P>
<P>
The trial period will continue for another year, "until we are
sure it is tamper-proof", McGibbon said.

<HEADLINE> Malnutrition to Cause 22.9B-Dollar Productivity Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will lose 22.9 billion
U.S. dollars in productivity in ten years to come if the present
state of malnutrition among children and mothers continues, a
press report said Monday quoting a Health Ministry document.
</P>
<P>
The country will lose 11.4 billion dollars in productivity due
to "stunting" caused by protein deficiency, 6.8 billion dollars
due to anemia and iron deficiency among mothers and 4.7 billion
dollars due to iodine deficiency among both, the document
elaborated.
</P>
<P>
The "unacceptably high rate of malnutrition in the country is
one of the highest in the world which is reducing the country's
development potential, it said.
</P>
<P>
About 50 percent of the babies are born underweight and 51
percent of the children suffer from "under-height for age" due to
"stunting" caused by malnutrition, it stated.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 percent of pregnant women are still anemic, it
noted, adding it is estimated that about 600 children die every
day due to malnutrition and 25 percent of maternal deaths are
related to hemorrhage and anemia, it added.
</P>
<P>
Stunting significantly affects children's physical and mental
capacity and their productivity when they become adults, said an
expert.
</P>
<P>
"Undernourishment leads to many diseases. Indirectly,
malnutrition is the biggest killer of human beings in Bangladesh,"
he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Overall prevalence of malnutrition in childhood remained at 91
percent" in Bangladesh, said a World Bank review completed last
June. It further said that night blindness among children over
five and pregnant and lactating women increased to over three
percent.
</P>
<P>
Some 56.3 percent of babies in the age group of six months to
six years were "moderate to severely stunted" in the country,
according to a 1996 child nutrition survey.
</P>
<P>
"Nutrition received little attention in national development
till recent days," the report quoted an official of the Health
Ministry as saying. "The government allocated very limited funds
for nutrition."
</P>
<P>
The government has prepared a ten-year program with a cost of
one billion dollars to reduce malnutrition to the extent that it
does not cause a public health problem. The program covering the
entire country, now under negotiation with the World Bank, is
expected to be started from July 2000, according to the document.

<P>
ZHENGZHOU, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Efforts to battle flooding
along the Yellow River, China's second longest river following the
Yangtze, have entered a crucial stage with the rapid approach of
the main flood season.
</P>
<P>
Records show that most floods occur in late July and early
August, and rainfall in the upper and middle reaches of the river
is expected to be higher than normal.
</P>
<P>
"We must closely monitor the flood situation and must not relax
our vigilance for even a single day," said Zhuang Jinglin, an
official with the Yellow River Water Resources Committee.
</P>
<P>
Provinces along the Yellow River have mobilized a 2.5 million
task force fully prepared to battle summer flooding, with ample
stockpiles of flood control materials
</P>
<P>
The first Yellow River flood crest entered the Bohai Sea on
August 1, with the Huayuankou Hydrological Stations recording a
normal water flow rate of 4,000 cu.m/second.
</P>
<P>
Yellow River flooding on the scale witnessed along the Yangtze
River this year will create an extremely grave situation since
many sections of the riverbed rise some 6-10 meters above the
surrounding ground level, according to Zhuang.

<HEADLINE> Fire Dies Out at Israeli Toxic Waste Dump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The largest ever fire at the
national hazardous waste dump in southern Israel died out
Monday morning, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said that bulldozers had began to clear up the site,
which is near the southern city of Beersheva in the Negev Desert.
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out Sunday evening after vats storing used
lithium batteries apparently caught fire due to hot weather.
</P>
<P>
Lithium is not defined as poisonous, but is highly flammable
and explosive, and neither water nor foam can be used to put out
the fire.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters, who rushed to the scene, fought the
conflagration for some five hours and finally decided to let the
main flashpoint burn itself out. No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
The site serves as the country's main dump for hazardous
waste. Thousands of barrels, which are stacked across a large open
area, contain as much as 60,000 tonnes of dangerous materials.
</P>
<P>
The environment activist group Greenpeace's representative in
Israel Ofer Ben Dov has called for investigation into the
incident.
</P>
<P>
He said the government must regard the site as a national
priority and take steps to make it safer.

<P>
NAIROBI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- More than three million people
in Kenya are unemployed, according to Gerald Gicheru, the
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another 500,000 people entered the job market every
year but only 150,000 of them managed to get jobs, he was quoted
by Monday's Daily Nation newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Decrying the high unemployment rate, he noted that more
emphasis must be put on the informal sector which had emerged as
the biggest employer today.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan population had risen from eight million at
independence in 1963 to about 30 million today, a figure, which
Gicheru said must be controlled.
</P>
<P>
"The high population growth has greatly strained the economy
and the country's resources, thus affecting the provision of
government services to the public," he said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The official also urged Kenyans to acquire technical skills in
order to be assured of employment in the job market.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt today that graduates from technical
institutions are in high demand in the job market," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government, he added, will retrench 169,000 employees in
the next few years in order to cope with the difficult economic
times.

CANBERRA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar slipped
back more than three quarters of a U.S. cent in a day of almost
stagnate trade due to a bank holiday in Sydney and Canberra.

MANILA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said he will soon meet with the economic managers of his
administration to discuss ways on further reduction of the
interest rates, a presidential press release said here Monday.

<P>
"This is what I had pledged during the campaign," Estrada was

<P>
The president vowed to find immediate solutions to the high
interest rates regime that has adversely affected many
businessmen, particularly the small-scale entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he added, more workers are being laid off due to
cutbacks in production and business failures blamed mainly on the
high interest rates.

"No businessman would dare go into business if he can not get
loans from the banks due to the high interest rates. This is what
I want to remedy as soon as possible," Estrada said.

Central Bank governor Gabriel Singson, however, said that the

<HEADLINE> India Says It Respects Nuclear Free Status in SE Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee assured members of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) Monday that his country respected the status
of the nuclear weapons free zone in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee declared in the Parliament that New Delhi committed
itself to a comprehensive and non-discriminatory global nuclear
disarmament regime.
</P>
<P>
India, according to the prime minister, set at rest
misconceptions about its nuclear tests in May at the recent ASEAN
conferences in Manila and during his interaction with leaders of
member countries of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) in Colombo last week.
</P>
<P>
"Our initiatives for confidence building and disarmament have
been appreciated," Vajpayee declared, adding that "there was
agreement on the need to commence purposeful negotiations towards
a comprehensive and non-discriminatory global nuclear disarmament
regime and a nuclear weapon-free world".
</P>
<P>
He said that India's participation in the ASEAN and ASEAN
Regional Forum meetings last month was particularly important as
it provided an opportunity to clarify New Delhi's policy on
nuclear disarmament in the context of its nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee declared that India was ready to enter into bilateral
free trade arrangements with interested SAARC countries, adding
that India had decided to substantially increase the ceiling for
investment in SAARC countries from 8 million to 15 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The decision would encourage a greater flow of Indian
investment and stimulate trade, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka had taken up India's offer on bilateral free trade
purposefully towards setting up a free trade area and a group of
experts would be set up to negotiate a comprehensive legal
framework for liberalized trade and facilitation measures, he
said.
</P>
<P>
On relations with neighboring Pakistan, the Indian prime
minister said he looked forward to continuing a "purposeful"
interaction with his counterpart Nawaz Sharif, asserting that all
outstanding issues, including Jammu and Kashmir, should be
addressed through a "direct, composite dialogue".
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers held talks on July 29 on the sidelines
of the 10th SAARC summit.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Vajpayee said, he reiterated India's
commitment to developing peaceful and friendly ties with Pakistan
and New Delhi's interest in a "secure, stable and prosperous
Pakistan".

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Urged to Suspend Fresh Bilateral Dealings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's ruling United
Malays National Organization (UMNO) Youth Monday proposed that
Malaysia suspend all fresh bilateral dealings with neighboring
Singapore until the latter states its official stand on
outstanding issues with Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The proposal came in the wake of a dispute between Malaysia and
Singapore related to the relocation of the customs, immigration
and quarantine (CIQ) checkpoint from Tanjong Pagar railway station
in Singapore owned by Malayan Railway company to Woodlands closer
to the border.
</P>
<P>
The movement has all along maintained that statements by the
Singapore foreign affairs and home affairs ministers did not
reflect Singapore's sincere stand, UMNO Youth Chief Ahmad Zahid
Hamidi said in a prepared statement at a press conference in Kota
Tinggi, some 385 kilometers southeast from here, according to
Malaysia's national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
Other outstanding issues between the two neighbors include the
supply of untreated water by Malaysia to Singapore, the claim over
Pulau Batu Putih (island).
</P>
<P>
Recently, Malaysia was also not happy with Singapore's media
reports on the new Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA),
Singapore's stand for not allowing Malaysian workers from
Peninsular Malaysia to withdraw their contributions to Singapore's
Central Provident Fund, and offer of high interest rates on
ringgit (Malaysia's currency) deposit in Singapore to attract
money flow from Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The UMNO Youth called on Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong
to state his government's official stand on outstanding issues in
Malaysia-Singapore bilateral ties, based on Goh's earlier
agreement and understanding with his Malaysian counterpart
Mahathir Mohamad.
</P>
<P>
The UMNO Youth Wing also urged that the issues be resolved
sincerely, responsibly and with wisdom, in line with the agreement
reached between Mahathir and Goh during their meeting early this
year.
</P>
<P>
The issues both leaders agreed to resolve were economic and
financial cooperation, water supply to Singapore, Malayan Railway
land in Singapore, the claim over Pulau Batu Putih, cooperation in
tourism and the establishment of a Malaysia-Singapore business
council.
</P>
<P>
"We would have to separate one issue from another. Settlement
through the official government-to-government channel is the
better way out at this point of time," Ahmad Zahid was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
As for water supply to Singapore, Ahmad Zahid said UMNO Youth
would want Malaysia, upon expiry of the existing water supply
agreements in 2011 and 2061, to only supply processed and not
untreated water to Singapore.
</P>
<P>
However, he said UMNO Youth maintains that the issue of water
supply to Singapore has never at all been capitalized upon to
pressure Singapore. "In fact, even before we've been supplying raw
water not for profits but because we appreciate that water is a
basic necessity. As a neighbor we're mindful of the other
neighbor's limitations," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Zahid said the movement urged the government to remain
firm in its stand on bilateral issues with Singapore especially
those relating to Malaysia's dignity and national integrity.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Takes Measures to Boost Shrimp Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
recently formed a national committee with the prime minister as
its chairperson to boost the shrimp production sector, a major
foreign exchange earner of the country.
</P>
<P>
The committee will provide policy guidelines and directives to
the concerned institutions and organizations for increased
production of shrimp and maintenance of the quality for export,
The Daily Star newspaper Monday quoted a high-ranking official for
the sector as saying.
</P>
<P>
It would also look into proper supply of protein, employment
and exports of quality shrimp through increased production, said
M. Liaquat Ali, Director General of the Fisheries Directorate.
</P>
<P>
A national executive committee headed by the state minister for
fisheries and livestock has also been formed to assist the
national committee on the fisheries sector.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh earned nearly 13.48 billion taka (about 287 million
U.S. dollars and in the July 1996-June 1998 fiscal year and 11.83
billion taka (about 252 million dollars) in the July 1997-May 1998
period from fish and fish goods exports, and at least 82 percent
of the total earnings from fish exports came from shrimp,
according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
However, they pointed that the rate of production of shrimp had
not increased up to the expected level although the area of shrimp
cultivating farms expanded to 138,000 hectares in 1996-97 from
64,000 hectares in 1984-85.
</P>
<P>
The government has established six shrimp hatcheries along the
country's coastal belt which is very conducive for shrimp culture,
thus creating interest among the private shrimp farmers, they
noted.
</P>
<P>
The government would provide due facilities including credit to
the private entrepreneurs to make such an initiative more dynamic
and expeditious, the director general said, adding that it would
also use modern certificate system to ensure quality of exportable
shrimps.
</P>
<P>
The shrimp sector in the country needed 3-4 billion shrimp fries
annually and most of which are collected from the natural sources.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock as per decision
carried out reform and modernization work at the laboratories of
the fisheries directorates in Dhaka, second largest city of
Chittagong and southwest city of Khulna to ensure the quality of
exportable shrimps as per the demand of the European Union, the
major importer of Bangladesh's shrimps.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei Monday approved a government plan aimed at reviving
the ailing oil-dependent economy.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a letter of President Mohammad Khatami, Khamenei
termed all the points raised in the letter as sound and said that
he agreed to all of them, the official news agency IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei wished success for Khatami and his administration in
managing the economy and removing the obstacles in the way of its
development.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Khatami asked the leader to comment and offer
guidelines on the plan "to boost confidence in the society and set
direction for the officials."
</P>
<P>
He said the plan was made in conformity with the principles
outlined by the leader and stipulated in the second five-year
development plan (1995-2000).
</P>
<P>
Khatami announced the economic plan on Sunday with an aim to
revive its oil-dependent economy that has been hit by the recent
fall of oil prices in the international market.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will focus work on job creation,
promoting investment and manufacturing, reducing reliance on oil
revenues, controlling inflation, providing people with basic
commodities and repayment of the country's debt.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Climbs 145 Yen in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar climbed to 145.71 yen
in Tokyo Monday for the fist time since June 16, the day before the
United States and Japan jointly intervened on the foreign exchange
market to prop up the Japanese currency.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was quoted at 145.63-65 yen at 5 p.m. (local time), up
from 144.79-82 yen at 9 a.m. in Tokyo, and from 144.70-80 yen late
Friday in New York.
</P>
<P>
During the day, the U.S. currency weakened to 144.60 yen before
resuming its upward trek, pushed by market players anxious for the
Japanese government to get to work on improving its economy.
</P>
<P>
Pessimism about the ability of the new Japanese government to pull
Japan out of its current recession is weighing on the yen, dealers
said.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet of Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, installed last
Thursday, has a record low 31.9 percent approval rating, according to
a Kyodo News opinion poll released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Market players are likely to test the year's high of 146.75 yen,
also seen in Tokyo on June 16, because they lack reasons to hold on to
the Japanese currency, dealers said.

the U.S. dollar, triggering losses on Hong Kong market and other
regional bourses Monday.

Kong government prepared to reveal GDP growth rate for the first
quarter, and Hang Seng Index heavyweight HSBC banking group
announced interim results, said dealers. Both announcements were
arranged shortly after the market close.
</P>
<P>
The government just announced that the first-quarter GDP fell
by 2.8 percent in real terms over a year earlier, the worst in a
decade, as the economy absorbed the impact of the regional
financial turmoil.

All the four sub indices of the index recorded heavy losses
Monday, out of which property shares lost 547 points or 6.7
percent and finance shares shedding 608 points, or close to 5

<P>
Familiar brands have maintained an advantage in the quality
competition, according to inspectors. Brands such as Kaikai cotton
underwear produced in Shanghai have kept improving the style and
workmanship, and have won the recognition of consumers, the report
showed.
</P>
<P>
However, the exterior quality of the knitwear is not very
satisfactory, according to the inspection. Meanwhile, some
products shrink too much in water or fade easily. The problems
have become the focus of complaints by consumers.

<HEADLINE> HK GDP Falls 2.8 Percent in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's gross domestic
product (GDP) shrank by 2.8 percent in real terms in the first
quarter of 1998 from a year earlier, the government said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The figure, the worst in more than a decade, represented a
further deceleration from the 2.7 percent growth in the fourth
quarter of 1997, according to the Census and Statistics
Department.
</P>
<P>
The department in a statement attributed the slump to "a
significant slowdown in domestic demand, as the economy absorbed
the impact of the regional financial turmoil."
</P>
<P>
"A more moderate export performance and continued weakness in
inbound tourism also contributed" to the GDP slump.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary data had put the contraction at around 2 percent
two months ago.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the latest GDP figures, Government Economist Tang
Kwong-yiu said: "The weak economic performance in the first
quarter of 1998 reflects a continuing consolidation and adaptation
process, as the economy weathers the impact of the regional
financial turmoil."
</P>
<P>
"As an integral part of the regional economy, our economy
cannot be immune from the profound shocks emanating elsewhere in
the region which are beyond our control," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, our economy has been adjusting expeditiously so
as to recoup competitiveness," said Tang, adding property prices
and rentals have fallen substantially, while wages and salaries
are softening.
</P>
<P>
He observed: "As the adjustment is gone through, it will
provide us with a strong basis for a prompt return to growth when
the regional environment and the economic outlook for Hong Kong
improve."

<HEADLINE> Taliban Advance on Opposition Headquarters in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Islamic Taliban
militia Monday closed in on Mazar-e-Sharif, headquarters of the
rival northern alliance, after capturing a strategic town in
northern Afghanistan, reports monitored here said.
</P>
<P>
The student militia forces were advancing from the west and
east of Mazar-e-Sharif, around 300 km north of the Afghan capital
of Kabul, in Balkh province, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Mazar-e-Sharif is the only major Afghan city not under the
strict Islamic rule of the Taliban, who now control more than
two-thirds of the country's territory.
</P>
<P>
Some local commanders in the key district of Balkh, only 20 km
west of Mazar-e-Sharif, have joined the Taliban forces, the
reports added.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's new assault followed their capture of Sheberghan,
provincial capital of Jowzjan province and around 120 km west of
Mazar-e-Sharif Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Sheberghan was the native stronghold of warlord Rashid Dostum,
one of the strongmen in the Mazar-e-Sharif-based anti-Taliban
alliance, which groups forces led by Dostum, former Afghan
military chief Ahmad Masood and Shiite Hezb-e-Wadhat leader Karim
Khalili.
</P>
<P>
Taliban's mouthpiece Radio Shariat earlier announced that the
recent gains had placed their forces "on the threshold of victory"
in their aim to capture the remaining one-third of Afghanistan
held now by the northern alliance.
</P>
<P>
The militia had briefly held Mazar-e-Sharif in May last year
but were forced out with heavy casualties after an opposition
commander who helped them suddenly changed sides again.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Islamic Taliban
militia Monday contradicted the news report that one of their
transport planes had crashed during a routine flight to frontlines
in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"We have checked in that area (Kunduz province) and found no
such incident happened," said Abdul Hayee Motamin, Taliban's s
spokesman in the southern stronghold of Kandahar, when contacted
by telephone.
</P>
<P>
"This report was released last night from Kabul, but there is
no truth in it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, reports reaching here from Kabul quoted Taliban's
mouthpiece Radio Shariat as saying that an aged Soviet-made
Antonov 32 belonging to the militia had crashed due to technical
problems while approaching for landing at their northern enclave
of Kunduz province.

<HEADLINE> First Made-in-Malaysia Aircraft Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Monday launched its
first Made-in-Malaysia two-seater experimental aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The experimental aircraft "Langkawi 1" is a collaboration
between Eurodynamic Sdn Bhd (ESB) and Association of Malaysia
Airlines Licensed Aircraft Engineers (AMALAE), costing more than
60,000 ringgit (about 14,457 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The project began in 1996 and the aircraft was built from
blueprints purchased from the manufacturer, Zenith Air of Canada,
with its aim at producing cheap but safe aircraft for the
Malaysian aviation community and upgrading the knowledge and
skills of locals in the industry.
</P>
<P>
The experimental aircraft would be sold at about 80,000 ringgit
(about 19,277 U.S. dollars), according to ESB/AMALAE Adviser Haji
Abdul Aziz Abdul Rahman.
</P>
<P>
Launching the light plane at the Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport
near here, Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik said the aircraft
which is attractively priced would make flying affordable to
Malaysian and this would eventually help to introduce and
popularize the flying culture in Malaysia and neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
Ling said although the Malaysian aerospace industry was still
in its infancy, the government has identified it as a strategic
industry, which is being supported financially by the technology
acquisition fund and commercialization of research and development
fund.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Fall Sharply in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices fell sharply in Tokyo
Monday on weak yen and renewed fears over Japan's fragile
financial system.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange nosedived 213.89 points, or
1.31 percent, from last Friday's close to end at 16,165.08.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, lost 16.80 points or 1.33 percent to
1,245.24.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section decreased to an estimated 300
million shares from 379.36 million shares Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sakura Bank was Monday's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Investors were bearish from beginning to end, with falling
Nikkei 225 futures prices in Osaka and Singapore and the drop in
the Dow Jones Industrial Average to below 8,900 Friday in New York
weighing heavily on stocks.
</P>
<P>
Banks fell hard after the Financial Supervisory Agency (FSA)
issued warnings Friday to get their act together.
</P>
<P>
Traders admitted the FSA's upcoming reports of its current
audit of major banks had investors worried.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese yen's fall to the 145 yen line against the
U.S. dollar in Tokyo also hurts banks. A weaker yen boosts the
value of a bank's overseas assets and lowers its capital-adequacy
ratio.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,334 issues listed on the First Section, losers
outpaced gainers 823 to 274, with 170 issues remaining unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Australia, PNG Sign MOU Over Gas Pipeline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- A memorandum of understanding
(MOU) between Australia and Papua New Guinea (PNG) was signed here
Monday to lay a 1.86-billion-U.S.-dollar gas pipeline linking the
Australian state of Queensland with PNG.
</P>
<P>
Visiting PNG Prime Minister Bill Skate, who witnessed the
signing in Canberra, said the pipeline would be laid across Torres
Strait, which separated the two countries, to the rich gasfields
in PNG's southern highlands.
</P>
<P>
"At the Australian end it is intended to power an aluminum
processing plant at Gladstone (of Queensland) and an electricity
station in Townsville (of Queensland)," he told a joint news
conference after the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
A consortium of companies led by Chevron is planning to develop
gas production in the southern highlands, then pipe it to Torres
Strait where the gas will be processed and the liquid petroleum
gas and condensate will be extracted.
</P>
<P>
A pipeline across Torres Strait and down the Cape York
Peninsula, the nearest part of continental Australia to PNG, will
then carry the gas to a proposed a 300-million-U.S.-dollar power
station in the coastal city of Townsville and Comalco company's
proposed a 868-million-U.S.-dollar alumina refinery at Gladstone.
</P>
<P>
Gladstone is a coastal town about 1,500 km southeast of the
Cape York Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
PNG Minister for Petroleum and Energy Rabbie Namaliu and
Australian Resources and Energy Minister Warwick Parer signed the
memorandum.
</P>
<P>
Parer said the pipeline could also supply cities in Queensland
such as Bowen, Mackay and Cairns, and mining communities such as
Weipa.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Rise on Singapore Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August (Xinhua) -- Share Prices ended higher on
Singapore Market Monday although external worries continued
dampening sentiment on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index (STII) gained
10.56 points to close at 1,074.76 points and the gains were
largely achieved on buying index-linked stocks.
</P>
<P>
The turnover totaled 91.71 million shares worth 133.25 million
Singapore dollars (about 77.02 million U.S. dollars). There were
198 losers against 73 gainers while 316 counters remained
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
TAC 200 was the most active stock as it finished on a turnover
of 6.37 million units. It was followed by Li Xin that had 5.49
million counters done. SingTel was next with 4.15 million shares
changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Creative 50 was the top gainer of the day as it gained 60 cents
to close at 21.60 Singapore dollars. UOB F edged up 19 cents to
5.15 Singapore dollars at close. KepFELS was up 16 cents to finish
at 3.38 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Sime Uep was the biggest loser as it lost 2.62
Singapore dollars to close at 0.78 Singapore dollars. RothmansI
shed 30 cents to end at 7.70 Singapore dollars. Venture inched
down 26 cents to finish at 4.16 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
As most Singapore-listed companies report their half year or
full year results this month or next, focus on the stock market
has been shifted on corporate results.
</P>
<P>
Investors are worried that companies may report poor financial
results as a result of the regional economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
However, a better than expected profit declared Friday by UOB
led to some picking of banking stocks.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the broader market was still bearish amid Japanese
yen weakness and a slide in regional bourses.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the yen fell through the 145 level Monday
against the U.S. dollar amid persistent worries about the Japanese
economy, that has kept many investors sidelined.

<HEADLINE> Efforts Expected from Japan's New Cabinet to Restore Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIDAIHE, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China,
expressed the hope here today that the new Japanese cabinet led by
Prime Minister Obuchi Keizo would made new efforts to invigorate
the Japanese economy and advance Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
China's economy is confronted with some problems due to the
pressure of the Southeast Asian financial crisis, and China needs
an improving exterior environment while depending on its own
efforts to tackle the difficulties, Li told a presidents'
delegation with Hitachi Ltd. of Japan.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that Japan, as China's largest trade partner,
will initiate effective financial and economic policies to
resurrect its economy, since doing so would help ease and overcome
the crisis, Li said.
</P>
<P>
This year marks the 20th anniversary of the China-Japan Peace
and Friendship Treaty, Li said, expressing his hope that both
sides would seize this opportunity to promote the healthy and
stable growth of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Li recalled his past contacts with Hitachi, including his visit
to its headquarters in 1979 and his meeting with Hitachi's former
president during last year's Japan tour, and said he hoped the
company would further expand its cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
Head of the delegation Kanai Tsutomu, president and
representative-director of Hitachi, said that relations between
Japan and China have entered a new development stage, and Hitachi
is willing to make its due efforts to strengthen bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Hitachi has conducted many cooperative projects in China, and
is willing to redefine its cooperative sphere to match China's
industrial development priority, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hitachi also plans to increase coordination with the Chinese in
such basic industries as energy, environmental protection and
high-tech. The company is also willing to help restore Japan's
economy and ease the pressure on China caused by the financial
crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hitachi is one of the first groups of big Japanese companies to
enter the Chinese market, and has so far opened more than 50
jointly financed or cooperative enterprises throughout the
country.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM Meets Chinese Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Monday that Malaysia treasures its friendly
relations with China and pledged to uphold its "One China" policy.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian leader made these remarks during his meeting here
with visiting Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan.
</P>
<P>
Tang said on the occasion that China and Malaysia are close
neighbors and there exists profound friendship between the peoples
of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the bilateral relations had maintained a momentum of
continuous development in general since the establishment of
diplomatic ties more than 20 years ago and the areas for
cooperation widened gradually.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have shared common views on a number of
international and regional issues and have had effective
cooperation and coordination, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang pointed out that the relations between China and Malaysia
also face problems sometimes but provided both sides look at the
overall situation of the bilateral relations, adhere to respective
commitments and mobilize the positive factors as well as reduce
and remove the obstacles created by the negative factors, China
and Malaysia can enjoy healthy and smooth development of bilateral
relations for the greater interests of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the financial crisis in East Asia during the
meeting, Mahathir praised China as a responsible big country for
its very important role in easing up the crisis by upholding its
commitment not to devaluate its currency Renminbi.
</P>
<P>
Tang expressed his admiration for the spirit of self dependence
to overcome the difficulties, exhibited by the Malaysian
government and its people and believed Malaysia and East Asia
would extricate themselves from the difficult economic position
and their economies would get on the track of recovery.
</P>
<P>
During his four-day working visit at the invitation of his
Malaysian counterpart Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, Tang also called on
Malaysia's Supreme Head of State Tuanku Ja'afar and held talks
with Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
Tang left for home later Monday.

<HEADLINE> Forecast for Israel's 1998 Economic Growth Gloomy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Israel's economic growth in
1998 could slide to 1.1 percent from last year's 1.9 percent, an
economic forecast published by the Manufacturers Association of
Israel said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The forecast, which is in line with other recent predictions,
suggested another gloomy year for Israeli economy which has begun
to slow down since 1996 after a decade of rapid expansion.
</P>
<P>
"The year of 1998 will go down in memory as one of the Israeli
economy's worst years, and the country's industrial growth is
likely to reach only 1.7 percent in 1998, just under the 1.8
percent posted in 1997," the report said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, the unemployment rate in Israel was
expected to rise to 10.4 percent, and the average rate of
unemployment for the whole year would reach 9.3 percent, a record
high in five years, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The association estimated that the business output would
increase by only 0.3 percent in 1998, the lowest rate since
1976. Overall investement in 1998 would drop by 4.5 percent from
that in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The one bright spot, the forecast said, would be the continuing
decline of the deficit in the balance of payments, which was
expected to be reduced to 1.2 billion U.S. dollars from 3.2
billion dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, according to Israel's Income Tax
Commission's data, the crisis in Israel's real estate market is
deepening in 1998. A sharp 12 percent drop in the number of real
estate deals has been recorded since the beginning of 1998.
</P>
<P>
From January to July this year, only 72,000 real estate
transactions were conducted, compared to 82,000 in the same period
of 1997, and 96,000 in the same period of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Urged to Develop Poor Southeastern Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) has urged
Turkey to take systematic and effective steps to develop its poor
southeastern region, the English Daily News reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Frederich Temple, WB's representative in Turkey, said the
underdeveloped southeastern areas could become a major bottleneck
for Turkey's economy if the problems there remain unresolved.
</P>
<P>
"Western and northwestern Turkey have shown a significant
development, while the east and southeast regions are extremely
poor," Temple said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the economic backwardness in the southeast to
unjust distribution of resoruces and unstable situation there due
to the constant clashes between government troops and the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party, which has been fighting for an independent
Kurdish state since 1984.
</P>
<P>
"The present Southeastern Anatolia Project has vital importance
for people living in that region. This project will contribute
to the private sector and promote new investments," Temple said.
</P>
<P>
The WB has agreed to provide necessary financial support to
the project, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the WB official said Turkey's high inflation arising
from inconsistent budget and structural problem is still among the
urgent problems needed to be tackled.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's high inflation rate, which stood at 80 percent at the
end of June, and the sharp devaluation of Turkish Lira have posed
grave threats to the country's economic stability.
</P>
<P>
Temple said that effective measures must be taken to bring down
the high inflation to create a healthy developing environment for
Turkey's economy.

<HEADLINE> Expert Suggests Construction of Flood Diversion Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- An expert from the Yangtze River
Flood Control Commission has suggested that China step up
construction of flood diversion areas to minimize losses caused by
floods.
</P>
<P>
"The loss will be less if we divert floods in a planned way
when the situation becomes an emergency," said Wu Daoxi, an
official from the commission.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the diversion projects along the Jingjiang River and
near Dongting Lake in the middle Yangtze Valleys have contributed
to controlling floodwaters. He added that facilities in some other
parts of the Yangtze are still substandard.
</P>
<P>
Hubei Province, for example, has abandoned 11 small dikes to
divert floodwaters and lower the water level in the main stream of the
Yangtze River. Though causing more than 400 million yuan in
losses, the strategy helped protect Wuhan, an industrial and
densely populated city in the province.
</P>
<P>
Tan Qifu, another expert from the same commission, also
suggested building more reservoirs to store floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 1,000 reservoirs have been built
along the Yangtze, mostly on the middle and lower reaches of the
river.

<HEADLINE> East, Southern Africa to Form Cruise Marketing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- A regional association to market
eastern and southern Africa as cruise destinations is to be
formed in October.
</P>
<P>
The 18-member state Port Management Association of Eastern and
Southern Africa (PMAESA) has approved plans to launch the
association at its recent annual meeting in Reunion, the East
African weekly newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ports in the region could gain substantially from an
increase in cruise ships, Danielle le Normand, the assistant
manager of Reunion port, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The region has experienced a steady but slow growth in cruise
ships, especially since the opening of South Africa to the world
market.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly feel that with an aggressive marketing campaign,
both at the national and regional level, our share of the market
could be substantially increased," she said.
</P>
<P>
Reunion received 50,000 tourists last year, 9,000 of them were
on cruises.
</P>
<P>
Kenya and Mauritius receive respectively an average of 58 and
16 percent of ships in the region, followed by Seychelles. All
the three countries have seen a steady growth in cruising
industry over recent years.
</P>
<P>
However, Reunion, Mauritius and South Africa are the only
member states with modern dedicated passenger terminals. Similar
facilities are also planned for Seychelles and Kenya, according
to the report.

<HEADLINE> 64,000 Angolans Flee UNITA Military Draft Tactics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of Angolans fleeing
into Zambia from forced conscriptions by Angola's opposition
UNITA movement has swelled to 64,000.
</P>
<P>
Ngande Mwanajiti, Executive Director of Inter-African Network
for Human Rights and Development, and Alex Vines, a Human Rights
Watch researcher, said here Sunday that the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) has resolved to forcibly
draft into their army men and women ranging from 13 to 30 years,
Times of Zambia reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mwanajiti and Vines, who have just completed a joint field
mission to the Angolan-Zambian border and refugee camps in
Zambia, also disclosed that UNITA, in their quest to amass a
powerful battalion to topple the Angolan government, has resorted
to killing hundreds of people opposed to its ideologies.
</P>
<P>
Angola is again at the convulsion of a fresh civil war and
the number of Angolan refugees seeking asylum in Zambia will
increase to more than 80,000 by the end of the year, they said.
</P>
<P>
Zambia will soon be flooded by an influx of Angolan refugees
with thousands of them now being crossing into the country for
sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the conscription for men, Vines said, women are
being forced to marry to and carry bullets for UNITA soldiers
before being educated on the use of military weapons.
</P>
<P>
The two human rights observers urged the southern African
governments to find a permanent solution to the Angolan conflict
to abate further human life loss and displacement.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Upset Over Maids Export Ban by Asian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti labor offices are
upset over a recent export ban of housemaids by Bangladesh, Nepal,
Indonesia and the Philippines, the Arab Times daily said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The four Asian countries imposed the ban in order to protect
their national image because some of their housemaids, or nurses,
working previously in Kuwait were involved in "immoral"
activities, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the ban was the ill treatment that many
foreign workers received from their Kuwaiti employers.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's labor offices will bear the brunt of the ban because
their profits are to be trimmed due to the cut of supply of cheap
foreign labor, the paper quoted recruitment agents as saying.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Ambassador of Bangladesh to Kuwait Mustafa Rahman was
quoted as saying that his country banned its nationals from
working as housemaids or nurses in Kuwait because many of the
girls previously working in the country had been involved in
immoral activities.
</P>
<P>
Some housemaids got "married" again with Kuwaitis despite
they were already married back home, he said, adding that this
undermined the image of Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The government's decision was also based on many other factors,
such as the maltreatment of its citizens working as housemaids in
Kuwait and other countries, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign housemaids in Kuwait are often reportedly beaten,
forced to work overtime and even raped by their employers.
</P>
<P>
Besides, they were so underpaid that some of them even can not
make ends meet in the rich Gulf emirate.

<HEADLINE> Flood Victims Living On Dam Near Dongting Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
CHANGSHA, August 3 (Xinhua)--Zhang Xiuying, 68, has been staying
in a make-shift tent on the Hudu River Dam in Anxiang County for
nine days. She doesn't know when, or if, she will be able to move
back to her house.
</P>
<P>
Zhang is one of about 100,000 flood victims in the Dongting Lake
in central China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
On July 24, the Anzao protective embankment in Anxiang County
was destroyed by floods and 20,000 hectares of fields were
inundated by water.
</P>
<P>
Zhang and her fellow villagers had to abandon their houses and
move to the dam in the rain.
</P>
<P>
Located west of the Dongting Lake, Anxiang County has five
rivers running through and 400-kilometer-long dams and is now one
of the focal points in the flood-control campaign in central and
south China.
</P>
<P>
"I was sleeping at home and ran out without taking clothes when
I heard cries of floods," Zhang said. "It was raining heavily at
that time."
</P>
<P>
Zhang said she could see her house immersed in water from the
dam every day, like a wreck with only its black roof above the
water.
</P>
<P>
Hao Zipeng, Zhang's husband, said the house would probably
collapse even if the flood recedes very soon.
</P>
<P>
The eight-meter-wide dam is crowded with simple camps built for
the victims by the government.
</P>
<P>
A local official said that the camps stretch for 60 kilometers
on the 125-kilometer-dam. Outside the camps are basins, bowls and
pots dredged up from the water.
</P>
<P>
"During the first few days, we lived on the biscuits and
distilled water supplied by the government," Zhang said. "Later,
we got rice, but it is not enough. Now we eat twice every day
without any dishes."
</P>
<P>
But she expressed no worries about the future, saying she heard
that the government had begun to move the victims to dry land.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the weekend 58,000 victims, 56.5 percent of the
villagers on the dam, had been resettled, according to the local
official.

<HEADLINE> Prince Ranariddh Denies Having Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Prince Norodom Ranariddh, upon
return from Bangkok on Monday, said he had no troops deployed on
the border with Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh went to Bangkok on July 31 after partial results
showed that the ruling Cambodian People's Party would lead
Cambodia's next coalition government following its win in the
July 26 election.
</P>
<P>
When asked about whether he had met his generals commanding his
troops on the Cambodian-Thai border, Ranariddh said he did not
have any troops.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh's troops fought with those of incumbent co-premier
Hun Sen after the prince was ousted as first-premier in July last
year.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh also told reporters that he would not consider
joining a coalition government with his rival Hun Sen, who is set
to become next prime minister, unless his demand for vote
recounting in some areas was met.
</P>
<P>
The prince has claimed fraud in the "unjust" and "unacceptable"
election and called for re-polling in some areas.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, the National Election Committee (NEC) said
recounting would soon begin in some communes where
"irregularities" were said to have influenced the election outcome.
</P>
<P>
NEC spokesman Samraing Kamsan told reporters that the NEC would
recount the votes in certain communes after some political parties
complained about election "fraud" there. The commune's names were
not given.
</P>
<P>
But he said the recounting would not cover all "fraud-ridden"
areas as requested by the parties, notably Funcinpec of Prince
Norodom Ranariddh and the opposition Sam Rainsy Party (SRP).
</P>
<P>
According to unverified initial results of the July 26
multi-party election, the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP)
won the most votes, to be followed by Funcinpec and the SRP.
</P>
<P>
Funcinpec, the SRP and other parties demanded revoting in some
areas, otherwise they would not accept the election results. The
NEC has set up a special panel to investigate alleged
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
In a statement faxed to Xinhua on Monday, the SRP said it has
collected evidence for counting fraud and will present summaries
of the evidence to the press later in the day.
</P>
<P>
The statement invited journalists, election observers and
members of the diplomatic community to "hear the testimony of
Cambodian people who have witnessed serious election fraud and who
have been threatened and attacked before, during and after the
polling and counting of votes."
</P>
<P>
The NEC spokesman said they would handle complaints about
election fraud after the announcement of verified initial results
scheduled for August 4. The final official results will not be
announced until as early as August 19.
</P>
<P>
Votes in 11 provinces out of a total of 23 had been verified by
Monday noon.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Product Quality of Large Enterprises Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- About 95 percent of the products
from large Chinese enterprises meet state standards, according to
a survey which was issued here today.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by the State Quality and Technology
Supervision Bureau in the second quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
"It indicates a slight improvement in the product quality of
the country's large companies, which has been maintaining a high
level over the past few years," said Zhu Mingxian, deputy-director
of the bureau, at a news conference in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Large enterprises in pillar industries did especially well in
improving product quality, he said, adding that the survey found
all the products from big companies in the chemical industry, the
industries of nonferrous metal, electronics and construction
materials, and 98 percent of those in the metallurgical industry
qualified.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that more than 86 percent of the 700
types of products from medium-sized companies met state standards,
while 70 percent of the 1,500 products from small companies passed
the quality tests.
</P>
<P>
"The product quality of the domestic enterprises has improved a
little in recent years on a general basis," said Zhu, "but there
are still some problems."
</P>
<P>
He said the general proportion of qualified products has been
kept above 75 percent during the past three years, but it never
surpassed the figure of 1990, which was 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The low quality of products of some small collective and
private companies has hindered the overall progress of the
country's product quality," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
About 30-to-50 percent of the products from these companies are
not up to standards, according to the survey. Earlier surveys
found that all milk powder and cooking ranges for home use,
produced by the non-state-owned companies, were not satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said state quality and technology supervision departments
at all levels will still focus on improving the management and
inspection of these enterprises in the next few years.

<HEADLINE> Drug-related Crimes Rise Rapidly in Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Drug-related crimes in Jordan rose
by a record high of 50.9 percent in 1997 compared with 1996, an
official report said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report issued by Jordan's Public Security Department said
that it dealt with 492 cases of the kind in 1997, 166 cases more
than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Some 803 people were involved in the drug-related cases last
year, up 22 percent from 1996, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The department attributed the rise in drug-related crimes to
more people moving from rural to urban areas and the increase of
foreign workers in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
But the report did not elaborate on the figures.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Jordanian police seized 82 kilograms of heroin, a 22
percent rise from 1996, and 3 million pills, 10 times of that in
1996.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is used as a transit route by drug traffickers from
Lebanon and Turkey, which has also contributed to the increase of
drug crimes in the kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Set up More Radio, TV Stations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- A total of 13 private FM radio
stations and three television companies have applied for
broadcasting licenses in Uganda, making the competition for the
airwaves tougher than ever.
</P>
<P>
If all the applicants are registered, Uganda will have
altogether 26 radio sations and eight TV stations.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government will build another 20 FM radio and
television stations at selected locations within the next two
years.
</P>
<P>
The 4.5-million-U.S. Dollar project is expected to increase
the revenue for the state-owned Radio Uganda and Uganda
Television, which has been plummeting since the liberalization of
the airwaves in Uganda in 1993, the East African weekly reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The radio and television stations are now moving toward
specification as they struggle for a niche in the market.
</P>
<P>
With the newcomers into the advertizing market, the old ones
say they'd like to face the challenge.

Patrick Quarcoo, the managing director of Capital Radio, said
"The new companies are welcome. We are not worried as we believe

NAIROBI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government aims to

</P>
<P>
A series of polio immunization campaigns started at the
weekend at 8,500 centers across the east African country.

<HEADLINE> China's Giant Coal Producer Hopes to Become Clean-Energy Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Shanxi Province, China's leading
coal producer, is hoping to turn itself into China's largest
clean-energy base in years.
</P>
<P>
Known as "a sea of coal," the province has verified coal
reserves of 287.3 billion tons, one-third of the country's total.
It now produces 300 million tons of coal annually.
</P>
<P>
Intensified coal exploration and extensive processing in the
province have caused worsening environmental problems such as
serious air pollution, leaving a 200-kilometer-long smoke
pollution belt from the provincial capital of Taiyuan to Linfen
city and the waste from a huge amount of chemical raw materials.
</P>
<P>
To change this situation, the province plans to upgrade coke
furnaces which lack recovery facilities in the Fenhe River
Valleys, and concentrate hundreds of smaller ovens in the same
valley into several groups where large modern coke ovens will be
installed during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
Urban residents in the region will be encouraged to use coal
gas to reduce the discharge of pollutants, said local sources.
</P>
<P>
Several large tar-processing centers and coal-gasification
enterprises will be built. Discarded materials from coal
exploration and in-depth processing will be treated to reduce
pollutant discharge to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
While improving the utilization rate of coal resources, the
province will increase efforts to develop and spread clean-energy
technology and energy-efficient equipment to turn Shanxi into a
region with both a healthy environment and a highly developed
economy.
</P>
<P>
The province will also introduce advanced foreign technologies
in its drive to make Shanxi a clean-energy base, which may cost an
estimated 10 billion yuan, according to local sources.

<HEADLINE> 5 Reportedly Killed in Taliban Transport Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 3 (Xinhua) -- A transport plane belonging to
Afghanistan's Taliban militia has crashed during a routine flight
to frontlines in northern Afghanistan, killing possibly five
people on board, reports reaching here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The aged Soviet-made Antonov 32 crashed due to technical
problems while approaching for landing at their northern enclave
of Kunduz province, the reports quoted Taliban's mouthpiece Radio
Shariat as saying.
</P>
<P>
All the crew on board -- the standard number of which is five
--were killed in the crash, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
No further information is immediately available.
</P>
<P>
Encircled in Kunduz by anti-Taliban northern alliance forces,
the hard-line Taliban have used their aged airforce to supply
several major frontlines. This crash was the first to be reported.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban and northern alliance forces are now battling in
Afghanistan's northwestern province of Jowzjan. On Sunday, the
student militia claimed that they had captured Sheberghan, capital
of Jowzjan, about 120 km west of Mazar-e-Sharif, de facto
headquarters of the northern alliance.

JERUSALEM, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- In an apparent effort to overcome the ongoing deadlock in
the peace talks, the Israeli government has agreed in principle
to free 100 security prisoners. The news came as Palestinian
officials expressed reluctance about continuing talks with Israel
Monday. They have threatened this could be the last negotiating
session unless Israel agrees to the U.S.-proposed 13 percent
withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- An aide to Palestinian National Authority leader Yasser
Arafat said Sunday that the Palestinians will call off peace
talks should Israeli negotiators fail to bring new ideas to the
talks on Monday. Palestinian sources added that they would not
accept Israel's proposal to turn some part of the West Bank into a
nature reserve as part of a deal on the further redeployment of
Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- A fire erupted Sunday evening at a toxic waste dump south of
Israel, sending fire fighters, police and environmental experts
rushing to the scene. No injuries were reported, but ecological
activists immediately issued statements calling on the government
to make every effort to make the dump safer.

<HEADLINE> Mobile Phone Users Growing Fast in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of mobile phone users
in China has grown to more than 18 million since the first one
appeared in the country in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
This means that the demand for mobile phones in China is
growing faster than that for other household appliances like
telephones, televisions and refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
It took 100 years for the country to have 10 million
telephones for family use, 20 years to have 10 million
televisions in use, and 30 years before it had 10 million
refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
The faster-mushrooming mobile phone number in China is
attributed partially to the participation of overseas investors,
the top three of which are the US's Motorola, Sweden's Ericsson,
and Finland's Nokia.
</P>
<P>
Motorola is the number one in China's mobile phone market and leads
its competitors in both manufacturing and marketing with nearly a
third of the market and after-sale service outlets throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
For a long time, China's telecom industry gave priority to the
development of telephones, first in the workplace, then in urban
homes, and finally in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to an increasing income and the advance of economic
reforms, China has seen a huge rise in the use of telephones this
decade.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this May, some 80 million telephones had been
installed in the country, eight times the figure seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
The number of China's mobile phone users is expected to peak at
600 million, based on an estimate of the country's population peak
at a maximum 1.5 billion in the middle of the next century.

<HEADLINE> Unemployed Kenyans Top Three Million  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- More than three million people
in Kenya are unemployed, according to Gerald Gicheru, the
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another 500,000 people entered the job market every
year but only 150,000 of them managed to get jobs, he was quoted
by Monday's Daily Nation newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Decrying the high unemployment rate, he noted that more
emphasis must be put on the informal sector which had emerged as
the biggest employer today.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan population had risen from eight million at
independence in 1963 to about 30 million today, a figure, which
Gicheru said must be controlled.
</P>
<P>
"The high population growth has greatly strained the economy
and the country's resources, thus affecting the provision of
government services to the public," he said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The official also urged Kenyans to acquire technical skills in
order to be assured of employment in the job market.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt today that graduates from technical
institutions are in high demand in the job market," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government, he added, will retrench 169,000 employees in
the next few years in order to cope with the difficult economic
times.

<P>
ANKARA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Turkish newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zaman (Time)
</P>
<P>
-- Turkey's Supreme Military Council is to convene on Monday to
decide on the retirement of Chief of General Staff Ismail Hakki
Karadayi and promotions of senior military officers.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Commander of the Land Forces Huseyin
Kiyrikoghu is the top contender to succeed Karadayi.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom)
</P>
<P>
-- More than 100 of the world's 500 biggest companies have
invested in Turkey so far, giving a great impetus to the country's
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Auto giants, including General Motors, Fiat, Mercedes Benz and
Toyota, have shown great interest in exploiting Turkey's lucrative
auto market.
</P>
<P>
Cumhuriyet (Republic)
</P>
<P>
-- As a step to ask the military to stay away from party
politics, Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz has warned that
increased pressure on the Virtue Party (FP) might give the party
more votes in the parliamentary elections scheduled for April next
year.
</P>
<P>
The powerful generals have been accusing the FP, a successor of
the former Welfare Party, of attempting to shake the country's
secular system.

<HEADLINE> Summer Camp for Obese Kids in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- No fried chicken, no braised
pork, no buttered bread. Life was really hard for 13-year-old Yu
Chi last week.
</P>
<P>
Yu weighs over 100 kilograms and, along with 52 other obese
children between 10 and 14 years old, was participating in a
week-long summer camp program for overweight kids in Shanghai,
China's largest commercial city.
</P>
<P>
On the first day of camp, two beds were broken when two of the
kids sat on them, said one camp counselor.
</P>
<P>
Children must get up at six o'clock every morning and then do
exercises such as running and swimming in the sweltering summer
heat.
</P>
<P>
In addition to physical exercises, the camp highlights
cultivating good daily habits in the children, said the teacher,
adding that they must make their beds and wash their own clothes.
</P>
<P>
Doctors from local hospitals have been invited to present
classes teaching the children about the harm of obesity and how to
scientifically reduce their weight. The children's diet while at
the camp is planned by professional nutritionists.
</P>
<P>
China adopted the one-child policy some two decades ago. Since
then, Chinese parents have pampered their children with affection
and allowed them to over-indulgence in junk food.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that Chinese children now consume too much fat and
sugar while sitting in front of the TV all day long and almost
never exercising.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that three out of every 100 Shanghai
children under the age of six suffer from obesity, 6.24 times the
rate of a decade ago.

<HEADLINE> UNSCOM, Iraq Start Talks on Weapons Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 3 (Xinhua)-- The U.N. Special Commission for
disarmament in Iraq, known as UNSCOM, opened talks with Iraqi
officials here Monday amid Iraq's call for end to its prolonged
inspection mission.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler did not speak to reporters
before his meeting with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz at
the Iraqi Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of his current visit here, Butler told reporters
Sunday evening that the UNSCOM wants to wrap up its work
quickly. He said during the talks, the two sides would review the
working program reached between the two sides weeks ago during
Butler's last visit to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
"We will check together what the progress has been, what
has been achieved, what may still need to be done," he said.
</P>
<P>
Butler termed as "very important" his talks with Aziz, saying
he hoped they could get to the end of the disarmament phase as
soon as possible so the United Nations Security Council could
consider whether to lift the eight year long sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Iraq has been accusing the UNSCOM and the U.N.
Security Council of not awarding its cooperation with the UNSCOM
and the International Atomic Energy Agency on their weapons
inspection mission in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Due to the strong opposition by the United States and Britain,
the Security Council failed last Wednesday to accept a Russian
proposal for scaling back the U.N. inspection in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein made it clear in a nationally
televised address last month that Iraq would adopt "alternative
strategy" should its cooperation with the UNSCOM did not lead to
the lifting of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has imposed comprehensive economic sanctions
on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990, and the sanctions
cannot be lifted unless UNSCOM verifies that it is free of
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM is to present its next report on the Iraqi weapons
inspection to the U.N. Security Council in October.

<HEADLINE> Three Tigers Born in Changchun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- A Siberian tiger has recently
given birth to three cubs in Changchun, capital of northeast
China's Jilin Province, bringing to nine the number of newly-born
tigers at the Changchun Zoo.
</P>
<P>
The three cubs, born on July 3, now weighs more than one
kilogram each.
</P>
<P>
This was the ninth birth of the 13-year-old mother tiger, Yan
Chun. In June, it had a miscarriage and gave
birth to a dead cub. "Usually, a miscarriage may lead to the
premature delivery of the other cubs, which would probably not
survive," said a zookeeper.
</P>
<P>
The zookeepers at once adopted measures to prevent the
premature delivery of the other cubs. The three cubs are now in
good condition, often crouching around Yan Chun and jostling with
each other to nurse at their mother's breast.
</P>
<P>
The zookeepers said that at present they could not determine
the sex of the cubs.
</P>
<P>
The other six month-old cubs at the zoo, one male and five
females, were born to two other tigers. The six now weigh about
seven kilograms each.
</P>
<P>
The Siberian tiger is a species on the world's top protection
list.

<HEADLINE> Market Research Agencies Boom in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- China now has over 850 registered
market research agencies with over half of them based in the
largest cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
The results of a survey announced at a recent meeting of
China's market researchers showed that China's market research
agencies include those which are either foreign funded,
state-owned, collectively run, or academic.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicates that China's market research industry
generated 450 million yuan (54 million U.S. dollars) worth of
business in 1997, with 73 percent of this money coming from
domestic customers.
</P>
<P>
It also shows that the turnover from special subject research
and continuous research accounted for nearly half of the total.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that market research will witness faster
developing in the coming years as foreign-funded ventures speed up
the process of their capital localization, and famous-brand
ventures begin to utilize the techniques of modern marketing.
</P>
<P>
However, the survey said China still lags behind developed
countries in the field of market research.
</P>
<P>
China's 1997 volume in this industry accounted for only 5.7
percent of Japan's total, and only 1.4 percent of the U.S. total
for 1996.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Imported Copters Not Airworthy: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The four second-hand helicopters
imported by the Ugandan military have proved not airworthy and
the sale agreement has been seriously breached, an investigation
report said.
</P>
<P>
The report has been made by a Uganda-invited South African
firm in response to allegations that the planes have not met the
standards required, the Nairobi-based East African weekly
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Based on the findings of the report, Uganda's Ministry of
Justice is planning to take legal action against the supplier,
Consolidated Sales Corporation (CSC) reportedly owned by Uganda's
rally ace Emmanuel Katto.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government is reported to have made the purchase
of the four MI 24 helicopters from the Republic of Belarus in
April 1997 for more than 12 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Up to now only two of the combat aircraft have been delivered
to Uganda. They are supposed to be overhauled before shipment
and to be in good mechanical conditions as stipulated in the
sales contract.
</P>
<P>
Bart Katureebe, the attorney-general, was quoted as saying
last week: "I have raised the matter with the suppliers. We shall
take actions on their reply."
</P>
<P>
On July 13, President Yoweri Museveni's Senior Presidential
Adviser John Nagenda issued a statement saying the CSC was
introduced to the military by an impeccable contact he did not
name.
</P>
<P>
Uganda opted for the second hand aircraft because the
government could not afford the new ones which will cost eight
million U.S. Dollars each and the military need them badly to
boost its air strike capacity.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian FM to Visit Iran to Amend Strained Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister Jawad
Anani will pay an official visit to Tehran on Saturday in a bid to
amend bilateral ties that have been strained in the past years.
</P>
<P>
"After a break of several years, we believe that with the new
political leadership in Iran, the time is ripe to develop and
enhance bilateral ties on all levels," the semi-official Jordan
Times Monday quoted Anani as saying.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Tehran, Anani is expected to deliver a
good-will message from King Hussein of Jordan to Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami and invite him to pay an official visit to the
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Anani will also meet his Iranian counterpart Kamal Kharrazi
and other officials to discuss means of political and economic
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Among the issues to be raised with Iranian officials are
Iranian-Arab relations, elimination of mass destruction weapons in
the Middle East, as well as the Arab-Israeli peace process, Anani
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Anani will also discuss with Iranian officials ways
of increasing bilateral trade and industrial cooperation. The
establishment of a joint venture in Jordan to produce phosphate
fertilizer that will be mostly exported to Iran is on the agenda
of the upcoming talks, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Tehran severed its diplomatic ties with Amman to protest the
kingdom's one-sided support to Iraqi during the 1980-1988
Iraqi-Iranian war.
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic ties between Jordan and Iran were restored in
1990.
</P>
<P>
However, the bilateral ties have been strained since 1995 when
Jordan expelled First Secretary at the Iranian Embassy Saeed
Batini, accusing him of "performing acts that contradicted with
his diplomatic status."
</P>
<P>
After the moderate Khatami was elected Iranian President last
year, the ice in the bilateral ties began to thaw amid Tehran's
efforts to improve relations with all countries, especially with
most of the Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Last November, Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan visited Iran to
attend the a meeting of the Organization of Islamic Conference,
during which he met Khatami and other senior officials.

<HEADLINE> Study Detects Widespread Smoking Among Kuwaiti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Up to 64 percent of the male
secondary students in Kuwait are smokers, the Arab Times newspaper
quoted a report as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
A study conducted recently by the Kuwaiti Health Ministry said
that this was a 18 percent rise from 1995.
</P>
<P>
But the study found that male adult smokers in Kuwait have
declined. More than 42 percent of the men over the age of 20 were
smoking last year, 10 percentage points lower than in 1992.
</P>
<P>
It also showed that 14 percent of the adult women are smokers,
adding that more and more female university students have turned
to smoking.
</P>
<P>
Smoking has resulted in many diseases. The cases of lung cancer
increased by 412 percent among females and 118 percent among males
between 1992 and 1997, the study said.
</P>
<P>
The rate of heart attacks and strokes at an early age (around
40) also keeps rising, it added.

<P>
NEW YORK, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States hauled three
more gold medals on the last day of the 1998 Goodwill Games to
boost its title tally to 43, ranking first ahead of Russia's 35
during the 15-day competition.
</P>
<P>
The United States top the medal table with a 41-48-43
record,followed by Russia, 35-29-29, and China, 7-7-6. At the
previous Games the top three were the same, but Russia overwhelmed
the United States with 68 to 37 in the gold medal battle.
</P>
<P>
With only the men's swimming and women's beach volleyball
finals featured on Sunday, the U.S. delegation remained overall
first on the medal tables. The World All-Star Team took a total of
17 swimming golds.
</P>
<P>
The Games, which offered a total of 5 million U.S. dollars in
prize money, failed to produce a high level of world class
performances, only setting two world records in the men's 4x400m
relay and the women's 50m breaststroke.
</P>
<P>
South African swimmer Penny Heyns was the only one who was
awarded 10,000 U.S. dollars following setting a 30.95-second world
record yesterday. The U.S. track relay foursome had to share a
total purse of 12,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Tonight, Fernando Scherer of Brazil upset Russian Olympic hero
Alexander Popov in the men's 50-meter freestyle with the fourth
fastest time ever in history, clocking 22.18 seconds as the World
Team overpowered Germany 85-37 to claim the men's swimming team
title.
</P>
<P>
In the unique dual meet competition in the pool, the World Team
collected 229 points ahead of Russia's 203, the United States' 161
and Germany's 138.
</P>
<P>
Scherer didn't have a head-to-head showdown against
Popov,double Olympic champion in the 50m and 100m freestyle in
both the 1992 and 1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
"The races were really competitive and it was mentally tough to
swim," said Popov, who landed the 100m freestyle title and raced
in second leg on the winning 400m freestyle relay team.
</P>
<P>
Kurt Grote chalked up a double victory for the host
team,winning the individual titles in the men's 100m and 200
breaststroke swimming. Lenny Krayzelburg captured the men's 200m
backstroke top honor to round off the American gold spree.
</P>
<P>
The World Team, made up of world stars from the other countries
except the United States, Russia, Germany and China, showed its
depth and power in the swimming pool, sweeping 16 golds out of
30,but all the honors its swimmers earned had to be credited under
the name of the World Team.

Sunday also saw Brazil's Shelda Bede and Adriana Behar power
their way smoothly to gain the women's beach volleyball
gold,beating Australian tandem Pauline Manser and Kerri Pottharst
12-9,12-5. Brazil also won the men's beach volleyball title
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Although the Goodwill Games created the largest purse money in
multi-sport event history, and an array of world stars in each
event competed in the 15-sport Games, the level of the meet
appeared not as impressive as expected.
</P>
<P>
The mini-Olympics, which had been staged three times
before,looks set to lose money this time. But Michael Plant,
president of the Games, shrugged off the question of financial
issues on the eve of Sunday's closing celebration.
</P>
<P>
"We always use the word 'investment'," Plant said. "We still
believe at the end of the day, this will be the most financially
successful games."
</P>
<P>
The Goodwill Games, the brainchild of Ted Turner, president of
the Turner Broadcasting System, had made Turner lost 109 million
U.S. dollars in the previous three Games.
</P>
<P>
"We will not discuss any final tally of revenue or expenses, as
is the policy with any other project of the company. The people at
the top are pleased with the results of the 1998 games," Plant
added.
</P>
<P>
The next Games will shift to Brisbane, Australia in 2001 with
12 events plus surf-lifesaving. It has decided to cut off
wrestling,water polo, synchronized swimming and soccer.
</P>
<P>
During the 15-day competition, huge sections of empty seats for
many sports in New York indicated a poor ticket sale during the
Games despite televsion ratings up 25 percent from four years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Games was hit by a tragic injury of a 17-year-old Chinese
female gymnast, who broke her neck in a warm-up for the vaulting
competition on July 21.
</P>
<P>
Sang Lan, China's vaulting champion, injured her spinal cord
severely and cannot feel anything from her mid-chest down. After
an operation a few days ago, Sang Lan has been moved to Mount
Sinai Hospital, where she is beginning rehabilitation. Doctors
believe that she is unlikely to walk again.
</P>
<P>
Sang's tragedy created more attention than many of the events
and the American people showed their concern and care to the
Chinese teenager. She will remain in the United States for at
least two or three months.
</P>
<P>
The next Goodwill Games will be the first time for the event to
be held outside of the United States and Russia. The previous
Games were held in Moscow in 1986, Seattle in 1990, and St.
Petersburg, Russia, in 1994.

<HEADLINE> PLA Insurance Regulations Go Into Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- A set of regulations became
effective on August 1, the Army Day, insuring all members of the
People's Liberation Army (PLA) against losses of life and injuries.
</P>
<P>
The regulations stipulate that if a Chinese service man
is killed in action, his beneficiary can expect to receive, in
addition to his pension, a guaranteed sum that is 10 times higher
than the pension.
</P>
<P>
Sun Zhiqiang, head of the PLA Army Men Insurance Office, said
the establishment of the insurance fund is aimed at offering
compensation to the families of soldiers who are killed or
handicapped in action, or who become handicapped because of illness.
</P>
<P>
He said that this is the first time an insurance system has
been introduced into the PLA, and that it is aimed at maintaining
the rights and interests of the PLA personnel.
</P>
<P>
The official said that past regulations focused on the
pension. However, the pension is quite low and the rights and
interests of soldiers could not be guaranteed in that way.
</P>
<P>
He said that endowment and medical insurance for those retired
from the army will also be introduced when conditions are mature.
</P>
<P>
These new regulations were joinly issued by the PLA's
Headquarters of the General Staff, the General Political
Department, the General Logistics Department and the General
Armament Department.
</P>
<P>
The compulsory servicemen, civil servicemen and volunteer
soldiers are required to pay a certain amount as an insurance
premium, which is no more than one percent of their monthly salaries.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred thousand officers and soldiers retire from the
military every year, and thousands of them are handicapped or ill,
and many are met with the problems of low pensions and future
employment.
</P>
<P>
This insurance plan for servicemen was granted by the State
Council and the Central Military Commission in July this
year.

<HEADLINE> Women Adapt Better to High Altitudes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Women's adaptability to the
low-oxygen of high altitudes is much better than men, according to
a recent physiological study of both men and women who have moved
to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
</P>
<P>
Wu Tianyi, a Chinese altitude-medicine specialist, said that
women are born with better adaptability because men and women
secrete different hormones.
</P>
<P>
People who first move from the plains to the plateau are apt to
suffer altitude disease as their red blood cells increase due to
oxygen deficit.
</P>
<P>
The medical study found that female sex hormones, called
estrogen, can check the hyperplasia of red blood cells, while the
male sex hormones increase the number of these cells. In addition,
menstruation also lowers red blood cells in women.
</P>
<P>
Also, thoracic breathing is found to be quite common among
women while abdominal breathing is more frequently found among
men. Chinese experts noted that under the same conditions,
thoracic breathing can supply more oxygen.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, progeterone in women stimulates the human
respiration center to inhale more oxygen under low-oxygen
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The study of female adaptability to high-altitude environments
has just begun, but this new knowledge is expected to have a great
impact on health protection for people living on the plateau,
according to scientists.
</P>
<P>
In China, estrogen is already being used to treat chronic
altitude sickness.

<HEADLINE> Qinghai Increases Fixed Assets Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Qinghai Province
pumped 2.85 billion yuan into fixed assets from January to June,
a rise of 36.7 percent over the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
This investment was 22.9 percent more than the national average
for the first half, according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
The province generated 7.64 billion yuan of gross domestic
product (GDP) in the first six months of this year, up 7.8 percent
from the comparable figure last year. This rate of increase is
the highest among all provinces and autonomous regions in
northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Local officials attribute the province's sound economic
development to the fast growth of fixed assets investment which is
estimated to have contributed 70 percent to the province's
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Heavy industry makes up over 80 percent of the province's
industrial economy as Qinghai abounds in natural resources. Since
the beginning of this year, the province has hastened the
production of electrolytic aluminum, steel products, cement, and
chemical fertilizers, and the construction of infrastructure and
service industries. Marked increases of investment in power,
transportation, oil and gas, agriculture, services, real estate,
and infrastructure also were reported in the first six months of
this year.
</P>
<P>
The province also introduced 15.08 million U.S. dollars of
overseas funds for investing into its fixed assets in the first
half, a rise of 31 percent over last year's comparable figure.

<P>
DHAKA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Diarrhea, dysentery and fever have
already affected over 40,000 people in Bangladesh's flood-hit
areas with 30 lives claimed so far, a media report said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Leader of various section of people in the flood-affected areas
have called for effective measures to check the outbreak of
diarrhea and other water-borne diseases with receding of flood
water.
</P>
<P>
"It's time to take necessary steps to prevent the epidemic of
diarrhea and other diseases in the country's flood-affected areas
to check further deaths," they said.
</P>
<P>
Health officials at the flood-hit areas were unable to face the
threat of such diseases caused by people drinking polluted water
and eating rotten food, they added.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh red Crescent Society has issued a global appeal
of 1.7 million U.S. dollars' aid for the flood victims, and
requested the World Health Organization to send about five million
water-purifying tablets to ensure pure drinking water for the
marooned people and keep safe from the diseases in the aftermath
of flood.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has been hit by flood due to constant heavy rainfall
since early last month.
</P>
<P>
Up to Sunday, 37 districts out of the total of 64 have been
seriously flooded, with over 17.5 million people being hit and
flood-related death toll rising to 256.
</P>
<P>
The flood has also damaged and washed away over 5,000
kilometers of roads, 1,722 kilometers of embankment and 2,215
bridges and nearly 200,000 hectares of standing crops, causing
heavy losses for the country.
</P>
<P>
The government departments concerned have already distributed
more than 11 million taka (234,000 dollars), over 3,000 tons of
grain and other relief materials among the flood victims. The have
also sent several thousand medical teams to the flood-hit
districts to treat patients with water-borne diseases and control
of their spread.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided not to seek outside financial aid
and succor to the victims of the flood.
</P>
<P>
However, the overall flood situation across the country marked
slight improvement on Sunday with receding of water in all major
rivers, according to the Flood Forecasting and Warning Center.

<P>
But he said the recounting would not cover all "fraud-ridden"
areas as requested by the parties, notably Funcinpec of Prince
Norodom Ranariddh and the opposition Sam Rainsy Party (SRP).
</P>
<P>
According to unverified initial results of the July 26
multi-party election, the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP)
won the most votes, to be followed by Funcinpec and the SRP. The
CPP is set to lead Cambodia's next coalition government, with its
vice-president and incumbent co-premier Hun Sen as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Funcinpec, the SRP and other parties demanded revoting in some
areas, otherwise they would not accept the election outcome.
</P>
<P>
The election committee has set up a special panel to
investigate alleged irregularities.
</P>
<P>
In a statement faxed to Xinhua on Monday, the SRP said it has
collected evidence for counting fraud and will present summaries of
the evidence to the press later in the day.
</P>
<P>
The statement invited journalists, election observers and
members of the diplomatic community to "hear the testimony of
Cambodian people who have witnessed serious election fraud and who
have been threatened and attacked before, during and after the
polling and counting of votes".
</P>
<P>
The committee spokesman said they would handle complaints about
election fraud after the announcement of verified initial results.
The final official results will not be announced until as early as
August 19.
</P>
<P>
To assure accuracy in vote counting, the NEC is now verifying
the initial results and will release the verified outcome on
Tuesday. Votes in 11 provinces out of a total of 23 had been
verified by Monday noon.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro
arrived Sunday on the Caribbean island of Grenada, where U.S. and
Cuban forces fought face-to-face 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Grenadian Prime Minister Keith Mitchell greeted the 71-year-old
Cuban leader at the Point Salines airport.
</P>
<P>
Castro said after a welcoming ceremony that he was pleased to
see a rebirth of cooperation and friendship between the two
peoples.
</P>
<P>
"We can assure you that Cuba will continue its modest
cooperation in solidarity with Grenada's developments," he added.
</P>
<P>
A state dinner hosted by Governor General Daniel Williams was
scheduled for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
On Monday Castro will meet with Prime Minister Mitchell and
slain Prime Minister Maurice Bishop's widow at her home.
</P>
<P>
On Monday afternoon, there will be a rally followed by a
reception. The Cuban leader is slated to leave late Monday.
</P>
<P>
Just 34 kilometers long and 20 kilometers wide, Grenada has a
population of 97,000.
</P>
<P>
On October 25, 1983, U.S. troops invaded the island after
Grenadian Prime Minister Maurice Bishop was murdered along with
most of his cabinet by dissidents in his New Jewel political
movement.
</P>
<P>
The invasion resulted in the deaths of 18 U.S. soldiers and 34
Cuban construction workers.
</P>
<P>
Grenada and Cuba broke off relations during the 18-month U.S.
occupation.
</P>
<P>
Grenada is the last stop of Castro's three-nation Caribbean
tour which has taken him to Jamaica and Barbados.

<HEADLINE> Italian Bank Governor Urges Unemployment Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The governor of Italy's central bank
has urged current expenditure reductions, tax cuts and public
investment for increasing infrastructures, especially in poor
areas.
</P>
<P>
Antonio Fazio, governor of the Bank of Italy, held these as the
key measures for reducing unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Another measure should be a new income policy linking wages
more closely with productivity, the governor said Sunday in a rare
 interview with the Italian daily, La Repubblica.
</P>
<P>
Governors of the Italian central bank usually make their views
known in official speeches and reports.
</P>
<P>
The interview gave no hint about one thing that all businessmen
and financial operators are keen to know: the bank's next
reduction in its discount rate.
</P>
<P>
But amid general expectations that there must be a cut sometime
now, he explained that decisions of this kind are strictly
technical and are not "regulated to assign rewards or punishments
to the government or society's components."
</P>
<P>
Monetary policy decisions of the bank are taken in terms of
"objective parameters" such as prices, liquidity, the state of the
public accounts and the general economic conditions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fazio hinted that any other way of envisaging the bank's tasks
would represent a relinquishment of its independence from
political pressure.
</P>
<P>
Fazio added that the welfare reform is needed, but should be
achieved with "wide-spread consent" so as to preserve its basic
aims.

<HEADLINE> China Developing New Way To Treat Mental Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese psychiatrists have
developed a new way of treating mental illnesses by using
traditional Taoist philosophy.
</P>
<P>
This "Chinese Taoist Cognative Treatment" has been claimed to
be especially suited to the psychology of the Chinese people. Its
effectiveness has been confirmed by clinical experience in 16
provinces and cities over the last three years.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Zhang Yalin, one of the people who developed it, says that
the reason they chose Taoism as the theoretical base was that
Taoist thought has a special effect on the mentality of the
Chinese, who often resort to it for consolation in times of
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
He explained that Taoist philosophy emphasizes benefitting
without hurting and acting without striving, restricting
selfishness and individual desire, being in harmony with others,
and obeying the law of nature.
</P>
<P>
The five-step treatment begins with identifying the causes of
the patient's mental distress and the subjective reasons for his
or her stressful reaction. Then the patient is helped to adjust by
learning from Taoist philosophy to resolve the conflict until a
new way of thinking is firmly established in his mind.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Zhang said the results are more encouraging when combined
with the use of medicines.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Expanding to Suburbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Two suburban counties becoming
districts of Beijing are a significant sign that the capital city
is expanding its urban territory by leaps and bounds.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily, Tongxian County in East
Beijing was converted into Tongzhou District of Beijing last year
and Shunyi County in the northeastern suburb will become another
"District" this December.
</P>
<P>
"After the change, the two newly added districts will be
considered part of Beijing's urban area," said Li Shaochun with
the basic-level government under the Beijing Bureau of Civil
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has a total of 12 districts and six counties at present.
</P>
<P>
In the future, Beijing will form a three-ring pattern with 10
districts in the urban area, two districts, Daxing and Changping
counties in the suburbs and the remaining four counties in the
outer suburbs, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's county-to-district conversion is just part of the
national urbanization process, the China Daily said. Statistics
show that the number of Chinese cities has tripled since 1980 to
stand at 666.
</P>
<P>
The change of the two counties into districts is expected to
lessen pressure on the capital's urban traffic and other
infrastructure capabilities.
</P>
<P>
"The conversion of counties into districts will attract more
commuters to settle down in the suburbs," Li said, explaining that
in China, being a city person still spells higher social status.
</P>
<P>
For Zhang Deqin, office chief of the Tongzhou District, the
change is even more realistically significant.
</P>
<P>
"More investment has been offered to our district and local
estate is booming," he said. "I was told that during the first
half the year, the district sold all the houses we originally
planned to sell in the whole year."

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Province Building Its First Wind-Power Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Construction of a 100,000-kw
wind-power station is now underway in Tongyu Prefecture in
northeast China's Jilin Province, the first power plant of its
kind in the province.
</P>
<P>
The project will be built in five phases. The first phase will
cost more than 87 million yuan, including 5.34 million
U.S. dollars of investment from Spain.
</P>
<P>
The second phase is due to commerce in March 1999 and will use
loans from the Danish Government.
</P>
<P>
Located at the juncture of the Changbai Mountains and the Great
Hinggan Mountains, Tongyu Prefecture is the passage for the
Siberian airflow heading southwards.
</P>
<P>
Wind-power stations can be built within a circumference of more
than 500 square kilometers in the prefecture, where wind normally
blows at an average speed of 6.95 meters per second.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to its rich wind resources, an installed capacity
totalling 300,000 kw can be achieved in Tongyu, making
it one of the largest wind-power producer in the country.
</P>
<P>
The province expects to get into the sustained development of
local energy by increasing its use of this clean energy source.
</P>
<P>
China has several wind-power stations in its northwest and
coastal areas and intends to install one million kw
of wind-driven generators in the next three to five years.

<HEADLINE> Chinese City Paying Closer Attention To High-income Tax Cheats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The city of Chongqing in
southwestern China is taking stricter measures in watching on
high-income earners to be sure that individual income taxes get
paid to the state treasury.
</P>
<P>
The move comes amid lax tax-paying awareness, mounting tax
evasion, and a weak tax collection system, the city's tax
officials say.
</P>
<P>
Stricter attention will be paid to income from nine major
sectors: power supplies, finance, securities, telecommunications,
tobacco, foreign trade, tourism, advertising, and real estate.
</P>
<P>
Salaries of lawyers, high-ranking executives, professionals,
people in the entertainment industry, athletes, foreigners, and
private business people will be scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
The city recently announced new rules on collecting individual
income taxes.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Overseas Tourism Declines in First Half of This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- A total of 729,200 overseas
tourists visited Shanghai from January to June this year, a fall
of 6.85 percent from the first half of last year.
</P>
<P>
Information from the Shanghai Municipal Tourism Commission
showed that in the first half of this year, 81,560 tourists from
Hong Kong and Macao, and 66,076 tourists from Taiwan visited
Shanghai, up 8.52 percent and 0.14 percent respectively over the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Due to the adverse impact of the Asian financial crisis and
devaluation of the Japanese yen, the number of tourists from
Thailand, the Republic of Korea (ROK), and Indonesia plunged by 40
percent, and those from Japan fell by 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
But this decline is expected to become slower in the later half
of the year, said an industry expert, adding that the overall
decrease ratio of tourist arrivals from Southeast Asian countries
and Japan will be around 30 percent and ten percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, tourist arrivals from European countries and North
America went up to some extent over the past six months.
</P>
<P>
In the later half of this year, the China National Tourism
Administration and related departments in Shanghai will hold a
wide range of tourism-promotion events in the United States to woo
more tourists to China.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is expected to receive some 1.64 million overseas
tourists this year, which would be close to last year's level.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Keeps Unbeaten at Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia proved its dominance at
the Men's World Basketball Championship by trouncing Canada 95-55
in Sunday's second round game.
</P>
<P>
The European champion decided the victory only 10 minutes into
the first half.
</P>
<P>
Even without its two best players _ Vlade Divac of the
Charlotte Hornets and former NBAer Predrag Danilovic _ and
playmaker Aleksandar Djordjevic battling injury, Yugoslavia has
looked like it could add this title to its 1990 world gold.
</P>
<P>
"They got on a roll and we couldn't stop their roll," said
Canada's coach, Steve Konchalski. "When we got the ball inside in
the first half, they seemed to block every shot."
</P>
<P>
Spain beat Brazil 73-63 while Greece edged Puerto Rico 71-64,
both improved to 4-0.
</P>
<P>
The Americans (3-1) didn't pull away from Argentina until late
but put together their best overall game of the tournament to win
87-74. Wendell Alexis scored 20 points and Jimmy Oliver had 18.
</P>
<P>
It was a two-point game with 4:00 minutes to go.
</P>
<P>
U.S. coach Rudy Tomjanovich said that his team was never fully
in control, allowing Argentina (2-2) to get within shouting
distance repeatedly. Marcelo Nicola led the South Americans with
26 points, and Fabricio Oberto added 18.
</P>
<P>
Alexis had 15, including three 3-pointers from the corners, in
a 5-minute stretch of the first half when the United States built
the first of its short-lived leads.
</P>
<P>
The victory moved the Americans into second place in their
group, tied with Lithuania at 3-1. The United States will meet
Spain next game.
</P>
<P>
Spain was led by guards Alberto Angulo and Ignacio Rodriguez,
both scored 17 points apiece when Spain trailed by as many as
seven points in the early stages.
</P>
<P>
Joao Jose Vianna had 15 points for Brazil (1-3).
</P>
<P>
Forward Nicos Economou's 19 points helped Greece keep pace
with Yugoslavia atop the other six-team group by defeating Puerto
Rico.
</P>
<P>
The hosts led by 13 at halftime, but Puerto Rico (1-3), led by
Eddie Casiano's 19 points, closed the gap down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere Sunday, Russia (3-1) secured a 71-55 win over Italy
(2-2) on the strength of Sergei Babkov's 26 points and Mikhail
Mikhailov's 15 rebounds, and Australia (2-2) handed Lithuania its
first loss, 71-61, as Seton Hall product Andrew Gaze scored 24,
including 10 straight down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
The top four teams in each group reach the quarterfinals, and
Sunday's losses mean Canada, Brazil and Puerto Rico have virtually
no chance of advancing.
</P>
<P>
In consolation games, Nigeria defeated South Korea 89-65 and
Japan topped Senegal 66-55.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Government Urged to Punish Rioters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- A known political commentator
Monday urged the Indonesian government to bring to justice the
real culprits in a series of riots on May 13 to 15 in Jakarta,
capital of Indonesia, and other cities.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary published by the Jakarta Post, chairman of the
supervisory board of the Center for Strategic and International
Studies Jusuf Wanandi called the May riots similar to "ethnic
cleansing" campaigns in other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia saw the worst looting and rioting in decades in
Jakarta and other cities. About 1,200 lives were claimed, and
thousands of buildings and vehicles were damaged and burnt.
</P>
<P>
According to a non-governmental organization, the total number
of victims of rape and sexual harassment from the rioting has now
reached 168.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said the riots, looting, burning and rapes in
May have left Chinese Indonesian "bewildered, rudderless and
desperate".
</P>
<P>
"If the planners of the riots wanted to scare the Chinese
Indonesians, they have succeeded. But they have also succeeded in
hurting Indonesia itself," the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
Describing as a watershed period for Chinese Indonesians, the
commentary called on the government to win back this community.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese Indonesians will only plow money into the economy
after they have regained trust in Indonesia's future," it said.
</P>
<P>
For this, the commentary said, most vital is a full accounting
of the May riots.
</P>
<P>
"President B.J. Habibie's effort to recognize the traumatic May
events and apologize on behalf of the government is a good start.
And the creation of an independent national committee to
investigate the rapes is welcomed. The investigation must go to
the root of the problem, even if its trail leads to powerful
people," the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
In the medium term, there must be an open dialog on the future
status, rights and obligations of Chinese Indonesians in the
country's national development. This should produce acceptable
policies for both the minority Chinese Indonesians and the
majority native Indonesians, the commentary added.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Reports Drop in Pharmaceutical Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has witnessed a sharp
drop in imports of foreign pharmaceutical products due to
implementation of a new medical reform program which requires
local residents to pay for certain types of imported products.
</P>
<P>
Beijing import 137 tons of foreign medical products during the
first half of the year, down 50 percent on the same period last
year, according statistics released by the Beijing Customs Office.
</P>
<P>
The overall decline in imports was the direct result of the
fall in imports of pharmaceuticals excluded from the list of
reimbursable medical products.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the overall trade volume of imported medical
products hit 14.45 million US dollars, up 3.6 percent on the 1997
period.
</P>
<P>
Experts explained that the total import value continued to rise
in spite of the falling volume due to price hikes for various
foreign medicines.
</P>
<P>
Joint ventures and foreign-funded companies account for the
bulk of enterprises engaged in the pharmaceutical import sector,
with related ventures accounting for more than 85 percent of the
total import volume.
</P>
<P>
China witnessed further optimization of the structure for
imported medicines during the first half of the year, with a rise
in imports of related raw materials and drop in imports
preparations. The change clearly indicates the growing production
capacity of China's pharmaceutical industry.
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of pharmaceutical joint ventures and
foreign-funded companies in Beijing were founded by companies from
Switzerland, Germany and France, as well as various other European
nations. Said countries also supply the bulk of raw materials for
medical products, with a lesser volume coming from the United
States.

BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major
Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
"People's Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji announced at the end of last
month that the central government will introduce active measures
to increase investments in infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the measures will be the most effective
method for stimulating domestic demand and promoting the growth of
economy, according to Zhu, who made the comments during visits to
the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Shanxi Province between
July 27-31.
</P>
<P>
-- The People's Daily in a commentary in its overseas edition
urges the Indonesian authorities to protect the legitimate rights
of the Chinese-Indonesians and the overseas Chinese in Indonesia
and punish those who brutalized the minority group in a series of
riots.
</P>
<P>
"Xinhua Daily Telegraph"
</P>
<P>
-- China's Ministry of National Defense held a grand reception
at the Great Hall of the People yesterday to mark the 71st
anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
 "China Daily"

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>   Italy, Libya Reopen Marine Transportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Italy and Libya on Sunday reopened
their marine transportation of cargoes and passengers in a move
towards a more dynamic course in bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday morning, a Libyan ship, Toletela, arrived in Catania
on the island of Sicily from the Libyan port city of Tripoli, and
would start its return voyage in evening.
</P>
<P>
Two ships of General National Maritime Transport Co. of Libya
will serve the line between Tripoli, capital of the
Arabian-majority African nation, and Catania.
</P>
<P>
Each ship has a cargo capacity of 6,000 tons with a maximum of
768 passengers.
</P>
<P>
Sea traffic between the two countries had been cut off in the
wake of sanctions imposed on Libya by the United Nations in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The embargo came after Libya's refusal to extradite to London
or Washington two Libyans suspected of involvement in the December
1988 bombing of a U.S. passenger plane over Lockerbie, Scotland
that killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
But bilateral links have eased based on an accord signed on
July 9 aimed at normalizing relations and bringing an end to the
negative impact of the past.
</P>
<P>
One of their odds between Italy and Libya, which was colonized
by Rome from 1911 to 1943, had been the question of financial
compensation for the colonial period.
</P>
<P>
Regardless of their odds, the two nations have built up strong
economic links, with Italian imports, mostly oil, totaling 3.78
billion U.S. dollars from Libya last year.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai GM to Roll Out First Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai GM, China's largest car
joint venture, is set to roll out its first mid-sized car model,
the Buick, in December, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Hu Maoyuan, president of Shanghai GM, as saying
that the goal is to enable "made-in-China Buicks" to compete
favorably with imported luxury saloon cars.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai GM is a 1.52 billion US dollar joint venture between
China's largest passenger car manufacturer, Shanghai Automotive
Industry Corp (SAIC), and the world famous manufacturer of
automobiles, General Motors (GM).
</P>
<P>
Five work shops, involving pressing, body welding, painting,
general assembly and power chain production, have been
completed. Equipment installation is expected to be concluded by
the end of August.
</P>
<P>
The vehicles will feature 2.98-liter 6-valve engines and
automatic transmissions, automobile components to be manufactured
in China for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai GM will manufacture 100,000 vehicles, 180,000 engines
and 100,000 transmissions when it goes into full production.
</P>
<P>
The cars will be sold in China and other Asian countries. In
addition, some parts that have been localized for Shanghai GM
vehicles will be exported throughout the region and to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Employees of Shanghai GM will grow to 3,000 at peak
capacity. An average of 375 hours of training will be provided to
each employee before production begins, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Agro-Foodtech Exhibition to Boost China's Food Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- An international Agro-Foodtech
exhibition, for the first time in China, is expected to boost
China's agricultural modernization by combining the agricultural
and food processing industries, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"The exhibition, to be held next April in Beijing, will not
only showcase the world's leading agricultural machinery, animal
breeding, food processing and packaging technology and products,
but also sell to more Chinese the concept that the agriculture and
food processing sectors coalesce to yield safe and high quality
food," said an agricultural department official over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Yang Hong, deputy general secretary of the China Council for
the Promotion of International Trade Specialized Sub-Council of
Agriculture (CCPIT-SSA), said that the CCPIT-SSA will cooperate
with France's largest exhibition group, Exposium, to organize the
show, which is expected to lure participants from 30 countries.
</P>
<P>
The official noted: "for years, China's agriculture, animal
husbandry and food processing industry have been separate in terms
of production and management, which has hindered the development
of agro-industrialization in this huge agricultural country."
</P>
<P>
To date, China has more than 70,000 food processing companies,
most of them small, with some using imported machines made in the
1980s.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government to Crack Down on Illegal Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government planned to
crack down on illegal foreign workers from Monday, according to
Deputy Labor Minister Jongchai Thiangtham.
</P>
<P>
There agencies, the Labor Ministry, the Police Department and
the Immigration Bureau, would join forces to arrest illegal
workers in industries not allowed to hire an alien workforce,
Jongchai was quoted Monday by the Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
The crack-down comes after a brief reprieve when various
industries negotiated with the government to allow them to
continue hiring foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government, which had earlier said it would deport
foreign workers to solve the unemployment crisis, had relaxed its
ban on five industries, mainly rubber, rice milling, sugar cane,
fishery and pig breeding.
</P>
<P>
From now on no other industry will be exempted, Jongchai said.

<HEADLINE> Robbers Disguised as Flower Pedlars Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Beijing police has recently
tracked down and arrested five robberies who pretended to be
flower sellers, according to the Beijing-based Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
In May this year, a female resident in Chaoyang District in
east Beijing was robbed when she opened the door to buy flowers
from the knockers. The knowckers robbed her house after
covering her eyes and mouth with rubber tapes, and then ran away
with cash and other valuables.
</P>
<P>
A similar case occurred in the same district two months later,
with losses of about 70,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The police later found clues from a robbed mobile phone which
led to the arrest of the five suspects on July 25.
</P>
<P>
They all confessed to the robberies and the murder of a
young man and the theft of five automobiles since June.

<P>
WELLINGTON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Auckland businessman John
Slater was elected President of the National Party, a major ruling
party in New Zealand, at its 62nd annual conference in Auckland at
the weekend, a Wellington-based newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
That means the National Party put Slater into the vital job of
managing next year's election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Slater has been a party member for 37 years and is the chairman
of National's powerful northern division, which includes all the
Auckland electorates.
</P>
<P>
"It's a huge responsibility but I've served a long
apprenticeship and I believe I've got the skills and the ability
to do it," The Dominion quoted Slater as saying after the
election.
</P>
<P>
Key issues affecting National's chances at the next election,
which is due in November next year unless the Government calls it
earlier, would be improvement in the economy and a public
perception of confidence in the future, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Slater runs his own textile importing business, which he
started from scratch. He took over the presidency from Geoff
Thompson, who had held the position for four years.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand PM Calls for Smaller Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Jenny Shipley, New Zealand
Prime Minister and the leader of the National Party, a major
ruling party in New Zealand, has called for fewer government
departments and reduced size of the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The call was raised when she was addressing the 62nd annual
conference of the National Party, which was held in Auckland at
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
In her keynote address, which was released here Monday by the
Office of the Prime Minister, Mrs. Shipley stressed that small
government "is one of the principles" in the National Party.
</P>
<P>
"The size of Parliament, the size of the Cabinet, the size of
the bureaucracy are all things that you and I need to have a clear
view on. I believe that we do have a historical view of being
wedded to smaller government and larger private sector
participation," she told the 600 delegates to the conference.
</P>
<P>
Dealing with the electoral reform, the Prime Minister called on
New Zealanders to debate the issue with respect to the size of the
Parliament. She indicated that she favors for reducing the number
of MPs from the current 120 to 100 and supports change in the
current "Mixed Member Proportional" (MMP) electoral voting system.
</P>
<P>
Under this electoral voting system, each voter has two votes,
one for an electorate MP and the other for a political party. Each
party's share of the total number of MPs is decided by its share
of the nationwide party vote. This total is made up of electorate
MPs and MPs elected from the party lists published before the
General Election.
</P>
<P>
"I believe some change will be required in the future ...... I
personally support change," Mrs. Shipley said at the conference.
</P>
<P>
In her address, Mrs. Shipley also reiterated that her
government would continue to allow greater private sector
involvement in the areas of business now controlled by Government.
</P>
<P>
She said she was not advocating a "wild-eyed privatization bid"
but recognizing that "where the private sector can do it better,
we will allow them to do that."
</P>
<P>
A Wellington-based newspaper said in a today's report that the
National Party's moves to dump MMP "have opened a fresh rift" in
the present coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Winston Peter, deputy prime minister and the leader of New
Zealand First, the partner of the National Party in forming the
coalition government, was quoted by The Dominion as saying that
opponents of MMP "simply do not want to share the political
power".
</P>
<P>
Although Peter did not name the National Party as one of those
opponents, his comments were clearly directed at Mrs. Shipley's
remarks at the National Party conference.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Benefiting from Mainland's Scientific Findings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- A recent exposition showed that
Taiwan's scientific community is benefiting from the Chinese
mainland's technological findings, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
About 200 mainland scientists were sent to Taiwan from July 11
to 22 on academic exchanges, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two seminars were held in the International Convention
Center of Taibei, where 246 technological findings were exhibited.
</P>
<P>
"The findings -- involving telecommunications, electronics,
machinery, materials, chemical industry, petroleum and space and
aviation -- received acclaim from Taiwan scientific and industrial
circles," the paper quoted an official from the Ministry of
Science and Technology as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official is from the ministry's Center of Science and
Technology Exchange Across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
The exposition, designed to enhance cross-straits relations,
was sponsored jointly by the center and the Taiwan General
Industrial Federation. The theme was "building links through
science and technology."
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, the largest of its kind, indicated that the
mainland's theoretical research level is higher than Taiwan's. But
the production and commercialization of research findings in
Taiwan are more efficient than on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan scientists are particularly interested in the mainland's
technology of environmental protection, oil exploitation, shipping
and superconduction, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The scientists also discussed scientific policies and
intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
Bright prospects exist for scientific co-operation across the
straits because the technological development of both sides is
complementary, said one of the researchers, who has attended the
exposition.
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 mainland scientists have visited their Taiwan
counterparts, and thousands of Taiwan scientists have traveled to
the mainland over the years.

<HEADLINE> "Grape King" Able to Defend Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Rozi Niyaz of Turpan, China's
leading grape growing area, will be able to win the title the
"king of grape" for the second consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the then 44-year-old grape grower reaped a record
91.5 tons of grapes per hectare, as against an average of 34.5
tons per hectare, thus becoming Turpan's champion.
</P>
<P>
With dry weather and abundant sunshine, Turpan, located in
Xinjiang Uygur Automonous Region, is a world-renowned grape
producer, especially famous for a seedless white grape variety.
</P>
<P>
Because of favorable climate conditions and improved
agro-technology, experts expect the gross and single output of
grapes and raisin of Turpan will be still higher this year than
last year.
</P>
<P>
Rozi Niyaz is from Lianmuqing Township, a leader of grape
growing in Turpan, with all 5,000 local households engaged in the
business. Last year, the township reaped an average per-ha yield
of 34.5 tons from its 1,300 hectares of vineyards, with, well
above an average yield of 25.5 tons per hectare in Turpan area.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Rozi earned 60,000 yuan (7,228 US dollars) alone
from his 0.4 hectares of vineyards.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the grape, Rozi, the champion defender, is
especially upbeat: "I'm fully confident I'll keep my title this
year."
</P>
<P>
The farmer-turned horticulturist attributes his success to
spreading fertilizers in a scientific way and superb pruning
methods.

<HEADLINE> Peru's Tourism Booming in First Half-Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Peru's tourism was booming in the
first half of this year with 380,000 foreign tourists visiting the
country, up 10.2 percent compared to the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Ministry figures show that the number of foreign
arrivals during the six-month period surpassed that of the entire
1990, when it was 310,900.
</P>
<P>
The increase is attributed to measures taken by the government
to develop the industry, which included more investment,
modernization of tourism facilities and development of new tourist
spots.
</P>
<P>
With favorable policies and measures, revenues from the
industry also witnessed steady increases: 527 million U.S. dollars
for the year 1995, 632 million dollars for 1996 and 800 million
dollars for 1997.
</P>
<P>
The tourism income this year is expected to exceed that of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Javier Valle Riestra, Peru's new president of the council of
ministers, said earlier that the tourism income could reach 1.7
billion dollars by the year 2002.

<HEADLINE> Premier League Top Clubs Warned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Football Association of
English has issued a warning against English's top clubs over a
proposed European Super League, according to local reports on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
F.A. chairman Keith Wiseman said:"Any club which plays unsa
nctioned football would render itself liable from FIFA downwards
to be banned from sanctioned football. It is as wide as that."
</P>
<P>
Wiseman also spelt out the implications of a breakaway league
for England players at rebel clubs.
</P>
<P>
"The postion is clear," he said. "Anyone who plays outside the
jurisdiction of the football bodies renders themselves liable to
be excluded from any competition within these boundaries.
</P>
<P>
"FIFA has jurisdiction over everything -- and that includes
international football. The implications are considerable."
</P>
<P>
The premier league has already asked its leading clubs to
assure that they do not intend to join a Super League.
</P>
<P>
Champions Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool are the
clubs likely to be approached by any new European league. United
have denied any involvement.
</P>
<P>
Leading Spanish and Italian clubs are believed to be at the
center of the breakaway talks but none has confirmed it has been
involved in discussions.

CANBERRA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- The opposition leader Kim Beazley is poised to take the
Australian Labor Party into a new era of immigration policy
Monday, declaring immigration is good for Australia, and he is
also expected to take head-on the immigration policies of One
Nation Party.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- More than 400,000 Sydney residents received the all-clear
Sunday to drink tap water but the state government has admitted

</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- Corporations would face fines of up to 10 million Australian
dollars (6.2 million U.S. dollars) if they failed to pass on to
consumers the widespread tax cuts to be delivered by the
government's tax package, Treasurer Peter Costello said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- Rio Tinto Ltd. is running the ruler over BHP's minerals
division in a move that could trigger one of the biggest mergers
and corporate shake-outs in Australia's history, according to

<HEADLINE> Torian Steals Limelight, Black Bows Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Former American footballer Reggie
Torian stole the limelight of the British Grand Prix athletics
championships in Sheffield, England on Sunday, beating world
record holder Colin Jackson and Olympic champion Allen Johnson in
high hurdles.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Britain's Olympic silver medalist Roger Black, who
ended a bitter and controversial last week of his running
career,could only manage for a third place in the men's 400 meters.
</P>
<P>
Torian, who has burst onto the athletics scene this year after
concentrating on football until 1997, won a tight finish to the
110 hurdles in 13.15 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, also the reigning world champion, dipped behind in
13.22 with Jackson third in 13.24. But Torian, the fastest racer
in the world in the discipline this year, had time to raise his
arm in celebration as he crossed the finish line.
</P>
<P>
"When I got to Sheffield I thought that someone had stolen the
sun. But I guess God stole it back and shone it on my performance
today," said Torian.
</P>
<P>
"I was more confident than anything. It wasn't the best race,it
wasn't the best time, but everyone was there and there was no
doubt who won."
</P>
<P>
Black, 32, had hoped to finish his last season by bidding for a
third European 400 meters title in Budapest later this month.
</P>
<P>
But after being left out of the British team for the individual
400m at the championships following a defeat at the national
trials last month, the 1986 and 1990 European champion decided to
finish his career on Sunday in front of his home fans.
</P>
<P>
In the last race of his career, the Briton could only finish
third behind his team rivals Mark Richardson and Twan Thomas.
</P>
<P>
Richardson was timed in 45.05 seconds, Thomas was second at
45.22 and Black in 45.51.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Paula Radcliffe notched up an emphatic 3,000 meters
victory over her distance rival Sonia O'Sullivan of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Radcliffe, who is expected to clash with the Irish former world
champion over 10,000 meters at the Budapest championships,burst
away from the rest of the field after three laps and was soon a
good 30 meters away.
</P>
<P>
The Briton kept the lead to finish in eight minutes 38.84
seconds with O'Sullivan well behind in second in 8:45.35. But
Radcliffe, boosted by some recent altitude training, said she
expected a bigger challenge from O'Sullivan in Budapest.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure she'll be there at the Europeans," the Briton said,
"I would never write her off because she'll just bounce right
back."
</P>
<P>
France's world 400 meters hurdles champion Stephane Diagana
bounced back from injury with his first victory of the season.
</P>
<P>
Diagana, who has struggled with calf and groin problems for the
first months of the season, clocked 48.70 seconds to record a
victory ahead of the European championships.
</P>
<P>
The world champion never looked in danger of losing the race
after he powered off the final bend a few strides ahead of the
rest of the field. Zimbabwe's Kenneth Harnden was second in 48.90
with Australian Rohan Robinson third in 49.02.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's world cross-country champion Paul Tergat also showed
his sharpness with a strong burst off the final bend to win the
men's 3,000 metres in seven minutes 39.50 seconds.
</P>
<P>
American Melissa Morrisson produced a flowing performance to
continue her superb season by winning the women's 100 hurdles in
12.74 seconds ahead of Jamaica's Michelle Freeman, the world
bronze medallist, who finished second in 12.80.

<HEADLINE> Corser Wins Ninth Round of Superbike Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Austrialian rider Troy Corser, who
overcame early tyre problems to dominate the second of the day's
two races, stretched his lead in the World Superbike Championships
in Brands Hatch on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Corser, who set pole in the rain on Saturday, had a frustrating
first race but his win in the second left him on 275.5 points in
the championship, ahead of the Honda-riding New Zealander Aaron
Slight on 245.
</P>
<P>
Texan Colin Edwards held off Slight for victory in the first
race as the works Ducatis hit tyre trouble with local hero Carl
Fogarty finishing fourth and Corser a distant seventh.
</P>
<P>
The Ducati mechanics solved the problems between the races and
Corser never looked in trouble over the 25 laps as he led from the
start.
</P>
<P>
"In the first race the tyres just weren't up to it...I thought
it best just to finish and get some points," said Corser, a former
Suzuki 500cc world championship rider.
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame I lost so many points (to Slight) in the first
race but I think I just made them up again," Corser said.
</P>
<P>
The second race was fairly processional for Corser but the
first was a real battle with Honda's Edwards being pushed by his
team mate Slight all the way to the flag.
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't easy. I had Aaron to worry about all time. The whole
race was flat out," said Edwards, whose two other race wins this
season came at Monza in Italy in May.
</P>
<P>
"I think if I had tried something special on that last lap,I
might have taken us both out," said Slight, who crashed heavily in
the last round at Laguna Seca. Scott Russell of the United States
was third on a Yamaha.

<HEADLINE> Rangers Beaten in Scottish Premier League Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Rangers were stunned in its
oopening match of the Scottish premier league when they lost to
Hearts 1-2 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The result was a repeat for the two teams, which met in the
Scottish Cup Final 11 weeks ago. As in May's final, French striker
Stephane Adam scored for Hearts in the sixth minute, and another
goal 14 minutes later from Jim Hamilton left Rangers in dire
trouble.
</P>
<P>
Rod Wallace struck back with just 28 minutes gone but despite
fierce pressure from Rangers in the closing stages,Hearts held on
to delight their home fans.
</P>
<P>
Rangers had hoped to put last season's disappointment behind
them, when they finished without a trophy for the first time in 12
years. But Adam gave Hearts the start they needed.
</P>
<P>
He stabbed in a shot from five meters after Neil McCann's low
cross was missed by Dutch World Cup defender Arthur Numan,making
his league debut after joining from PSV Eindhoven.
</P>
<P>
Hamilton doubled the lead when McCann robbed Jonas Thern of the
ball and supplied the perfect pass which his striker finished off
with a low left foot shot.
</P>
<P>
Wallace, one of Advocaat's signings, drilled in a right foot
shot after Dutch international Giovanni van Bronckhorst's mishit
shot ran into his path.

<HEADLINE> Heat Blamed for Train Derailments in Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Temperatures up to over 40
degrees centigrade were blamed for warping stretches of railroad
track, causing two separate Union Pacific train derailments in
Texas of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The heat also hampered efforts to fight grass and brush fires
in north Texas, destroyed a home and forced the evacuation of
about 100 people from rural Parker County west of Fort Worth, news
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's temperature in Dallas passed 38 degrees centigrade at
noon.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-nine deaths statewide have been blamed on heat-related
causes, pushing the nationwide total to 155, including 29 in
Louisiana and 19 in Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
Heat-warped railroad tracks derailed 13 cars of a 112-car
freight train about about 13 kilometers north of Fort Worth on
Saturday, Union Pacific spokesman Mark Davis said Sunday. Nine of
the cars carried aluminum ingots. There were no injuries.
</P>
<P>
Davis blamed it on a "sun kink," when a sudden change in
temperature or extreme heat expands the rail and moves it out of
alignment.
</P>
<P>
Hill County sheriff's Deputy Joe Milligan said the same could
be said for another Union Pacific accident Saturday, a
Houston-bound 126-car train carrying coal from Wyoming. It ran off
the tracks near Hillsboro, about 100 kilometers south of Dallas.
Twelve cars derailed and there were no injuries.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Prison Population Keeps Increasing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The adult prison population in
the United States grew to more than 1.2 million in 1997, as
inmates served longer terms for violent crimes and a constant
stream of criminals entered prison doors, the Justice Department
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 5.2 percent growth to 1,244,554 federal and state prison
inmates by year's end was slightly below the seven percent annual
average growth during the 1990s, the department's Bureau of
Justice Statistics said.
</P>

"The increased time served, particularly for violent crimes, is
a product of tougher parole boards and such measures as longer

interview, according to the Associated Press. Such laws have
proliferated at the state and federal level during the 1990s.

A rise in revoked probation and parole has been a major factor
in keeping admissions stable even though violent crime has
declined during the 1990s, Beck said.
