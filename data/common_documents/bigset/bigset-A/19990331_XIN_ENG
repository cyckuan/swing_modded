<HEADLINE> NATO Keeps Intensified Air Strikes in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- An air officer of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) said here Tuesday that the
alliance will continue to plan vigorously to maintain and to
increase the intensity of the air strikes in coming days in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
David Wilby, the senior NATO air officer, told a news briefing
that the alliance is now in the offensive operations
around-the-clock. "We are well into our plans for Phase II
operations. More offensive assets specifically suited for this
role are entering our order of battle. And the whether is set to
improve."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea told reporters that
NATO had no preplanned targets in Montenegro during the military
operations Monday night. He made remarks referring to some media
reports about the preplanned targets in the republic neighboring
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
When asked if Russian Prime Minister Yevgeni Primakov had
brought some results from Belgrade for a peace deal, the spokesman
said international envoys had a rather frustrating time in
Belgrade recently. "Obviously we hope that Prime Minister Primakov
will be successful today in persuading Milosevic to halt his
attack in Kosovo, that is what we're looking for."
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman pointed to a NATO view of the peace
mission's success. "The crucial point of the mission is not to
stop the NATO campaign, it's to stop the Serb attacks, that is the
yardstick of the success, that was our objective obviously," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We'll see what the results of these talks. But as you know, we
are continuing air operations today, we see no need to relent to a
pressure, and we hope Prime Minister Primakov would deliver a very
stern and compromising message to President Milosevic and share
the determination of the international community to focus the
attention on stopping the violence in Kosovo," Shea told reporters
at the NATO headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
When answering a question about Primakov's mission in Belgrade,
Shea said, "We are not looking for deals, secret or otherwise, we
are looking for actions and guarantees that the fighting will
stop."

TIRANA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- More than 2,000 Macedonians
demonstrating against NATO military action in Yugoslavia gathered
again in the northern Macedonian city of Kumanovo on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Holding Yugoslav and Macedonian flags and chanting anti-NATO
slogans, the protesters marched through Kumanovo, a city close to
Yugoslavia that has been used by NATO as a military base for the
strike on Yugoslavia. They called for a quick end to the disaster
in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
During the demonstration, some Macedonian Albanians and some
protesters rioted before police arrived. One policeman and two
protesters were injured in the ensuing conflict.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations against NATO's action first broke out in
Macedonia's capital city Skopje on March 25 and 26. More than 2,
000 pro-Yugoslavians participated in the protests.
</P>
<P>
NATO bombs pounded Yugoslavia for the sixth day Monday. NATO is
trying to force Serbs to accept a peace plan that calls for 28,000
foreign troops in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urged to End Occupation of Disputed Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid Tuesday called on Iran to "end occupation" of three
disputed islands in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Meguid made the call when he spoke to reporters about the
dispute between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Iran over the
sovereignty of the islands of Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu
Musa.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Iranian government to halt further establishment
of any facilities on the islands and demolish the installations
already set up.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the 22-nation pan-Arab forum reasserted support
for UAE's claim of sovereignty over the three islands near the
strategic Strait of Hormuz.
</P>
<P>
He called on the two countries to resort to peaceful means to
end the dispute on the basis international laws.
</P>
<P>
Both the UAE and Iran claim ownership of the three islands, on
which Iran deployed troops and civil workers in 1971 when Britain
pulled back from them. The two countries have expressed readiness
to solve the dispute through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has proposed to solve the problem through international
arbitration while Iran prefer bilateral negotiations.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Value of Contracts for Construction Falls in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The value of new construction
contracts dropped for a second consecutive month in February to
its lowest level since September 1997, the Wall Street Journal
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The value of new building contracts fell to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 363.26 billion dollars, down 4.7 percent
from 381.28 billion dollars in January, according to F.W. Dodge, a
business research division of publisher McGraw-Hill Cos.
</P>
<P>
The Dodge Index, a benchmark of national construction value,
fell to 144 in February, down seven points from a revised score of
151 in January, but remains six points higher than the
year-earlier month. The index uses 1992 as a base year of 100.
</P>
<P>
Residential building, a category that accounts for nearly half
of all construction, fell 7 percent from January to 173 billion
dollars on a seasonally adjusted annual basis. The back-to-back
decline in residential construction contracts parallels a second
straight drop for new-home sales in February, a drop announced by
the Commerce Department Monday.
</P>
<P>
Despite a swell of institutional construction, the value of
nonresidential building contracts edged lower, down 2 percent to
122.65 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Nonbuilding construction, including public works, fell 4
percent in February to 67.62 billion dollars, pulled lower by a 3
percent drop in highway projects.

<HEADLINE> 4 Lebanese Soldiers Wounded by Israeli Helicopters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Four Lebanese army soldiers,
including an officer, were wounded Tuesday by Israeli helicopters
in the country's eastern West Bekaa Valley.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers were hit during an exchange of fire with Israeli
helicopters in the area of Jinem just north of the Israeli occupied
border zone in south Lebanon, a statement issued by the army said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli helicopters were carrying out a mission of
bombardment on nearby hills and wadies believed to be hideouts
for guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
However, the injured soldiers were not in serious conditions,
the statement added.
</P>
<P>
This is the first casualties the Lebanese army suffered in
south Lebanon since the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese army has rarely confronted with Israeli troops
which set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon in
1985.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is spearheading a guerrilla war in a bid to oust
Israeli occupation forces out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Sao Tome &AMP; Principe Gets New Finance Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Miguel Trovoada, president of Sao
Tome &AMP; Principe, has appointed Adelino Castelo David as the new
minister of planning, finance and cooperation, to replace the
Afonso Varela, who resigned last week.
</P>
<P>
The official Angolan News Agency reported Tuesday that Varela,
who was alleged to be involved in the 500-million-U.S.-dollar
financial scandal, asked to step down last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Guilherme Posser da Costa said that as a member
of the investigation group of the financial scandal, Varela
resigned for his " improper connection" with those who are
directly or indirectly involved in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
Early last month, Belgium police detained three foreigners for
their illegal financial dealing, in which a large number of state
treasury bonds were confiscated. The bonds were later found to be
issued without the permission of the Sao Tome government.
</P>
<P>
The scandal touched off a big stir in the island country and
the government thus removed Carlos Quaresma, governor of the
central bank from his office on March 15.
</P>
<P>
The 43-year old David is an adviser for the World Bank office
in Maputo and an economist, who has served as governor of the
central bank.
</P>
<P>
It was noted that David has been appointed as finance minister
just before the parliament budget debate and the visit by
Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres who is expected to
discuss debt issues with this island country.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Protest Against Land Confiscation by Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Arab Communities in Israel and
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip held annual Land Day
demonstrations to protest against confiscation of Arab land by
Israel.
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 Arab residents in the Galilee, northern Israel,
held a peaceful demonstration to mark the 23rd anniversary of the
Land Day, according to Israel televisions.
</P>
<P>
The Land Day which falls on March 30 is to mark the killing of
six Arabs by Israeli troops in 1976 in Arab protests against the
confiscation of land from their communities in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators said the focus of this year's rally is to
protest against the limitation Israel put on the development of
Arab towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians also held demonstrations in the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip, but only one incident of violence has been reported in
the village of Beit Omra near Hebron.
</P>
<P>
TV pictures showed several dozens of Palestinian youths
burned tyres and threw stones at Israeli soldiers, who responded
with tear gases and rubber-coated bullets.
</P>
<P>
This year's Land Day passed relatively peaceful partly because
it coincided with the Muslim festival of Eid al-Adha, or feast of
sacrifice, which entered its fourth and last day Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Previous anniversaries have been marked by violent clashes
between protesters and Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
In the Arab town of Umm el-Fahm in northern Israel, the Land
Day passed quietly Tuesday because local Arab leaders and
government officials have made progress in their talks over a land
dispute.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 Umm el-Fahm residents and 20 Israeli policemen
were injured last September in two days of clashes sparked by an
Israeli army attempt to confiscate land for use as a firing
range.

<HEADLINE> UK Donates $110 Mln to Boost Uganda's Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
decided to donate 147 billion shillings (110 million U.S. dollars)
to Uganda in the next five years to boost education programs in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The plan was announced Tuesday by British High Commissioner to
Uganda Michael Cook , a press release from British High Commission
to Uganda said.
</P>
<P>
The funds will go towards the construction of classrooms,
teaching materials, teacher training in the primary school sector
in some districts.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said that the grant will enable the government
 to strengthen its role in education.
</P>
<P>
Cook pledged that British government will continue to support
Uganda's Universal Primary Education (UPE) program.
</P>
<P>
Since Uganda launched its UPE program in early 1997, the
primary school enrolment has topped 5.2 million pupils, doubling
of the figure before the program.
</P>
<P>
To meet the increasing demand for classrooms and teachers, the
government needs 240 billion shillings (180 million dollars) to
accomplish the target of providing 41,000 classrooms to pupils.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Denies Offensive Against Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea denied Tuesday that its
forces had ever launched any offensive against Ethiopia on Monday,
saying that Ethiopia's claims were "unfounded and contradictory".
</P>
<P>
Eritrean Foreign Ministry said in a statement in response to
Ethiopian allegations that Eritrean forces "launched two
counter-offensives on the Mereb River and both were repelled while
on the Zala-Anbessa-Egala Front, there was unusually heavy
shelling from the Eritrean side."
</P>
<P>
The statement said Ethiopian claims "can only be interpreted as
a thinly veiled intention on their part to launch fresh
offensives."
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean statement noted that Ethiopia asserted Sunday that
45, 000 Eritrean troops had been put out of action and while 91
tanks had been captured or destroyed, which had resulted in "a
total decimation of Eritrean fighting capacity".
</P>
<P>
An Eritrean Foreign Ministry spokesperson Tuesday said,
"Ethiopians claim to destroy us, then say we attack. "
</P>
<P>
The border conflict between the Horn of Africa neighbors broke
out last May and erupted again in early February after an
eight-month lull. Eritrea occupied the disputed Badme area in May
1998 but was pushed out of the area last month.
</P>
<P>
Both Ethiopia and Eritrea have accepted a peace proposal by
the Organization of African Unity (OAU), but the diplomatic
efforts to persuade both sides to accept an immediate cease-fire
have failed.

<P>
MAPUTO, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano urged Tuesday the economic integrity among Indian Ocean
rim countries, to face the challenge of the ever-growing tide of
economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the second meeting of the Councils
of Ministers of the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional
Cooperation, Chissano said that countries along the Indian Ocean
rim should overcome the obstacle of geological distance and
enhance their cooperation for the interest of the people.
</P>
<P>
The association, Chissano said, is playing an important role
among the Indian Ocean countries in strengthening their economic
cooperation ties, especially in personnel training, the management
of economy, tourism environment and natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Chissano said that there may be great potential along the
Indian Ocean rim, citing that the ocean takes about one third of
the marine transportation and two thirds of oil transportation.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation has
14 members including South Africa, Mozambique, Australia, India,
Indonesia, Singapore, and Kenya.

<HEADLINE> Libya Asks Why U.S. Still Offers Reward on Lockerbie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Libya wants the U.N.
Security Council to ask why the United States is still offering a
reward for the apprehension of two men wanted in the bombing of an
airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, when arrangements for their
handover have already been made.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the president of the 15-member Council, Qin
Huasun of China, Libyan U.N. Ambassador Abuzed Dorda said the
Voice of America broadcast a U.S. government announcement last
week offering a 2 million U.S. dollar reward for information
leading to the arrest of the two men accused of bombing Pan Am
flight 103 over Lockerbie in December 1988 in which 270 people
were killed.
</P>
<P>
Dorda asked why the announcement was broadcast "after the
relevant agreements were reached through the secretary-general of
the United Nations" and with the mediation of South Africa and
Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to an agreement announced on March 19 under
which the two wanted men are to be handed over to the United
Nations by April 6, to be tried before a Scottish court in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"We also wonder to whom they might pay the reward that was
announced once again today and whether the intention is to entice
adventurers seeking the reward into abducting the two suspects
while they are on their way to the Netherlands," Dorda added in
his letter dated March 25.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to find that you and the Security Council will have an
explanation of the rationale and purposes of the editorial
containing this announcement and of the objective in broadcasting
it at this particular time," he said in the letter.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Re-arrests Rwanda Genocide Suspect Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian authorities have
re- arrested Bernard Ntuyahaga, a Rwanda genocide suspect who was
released by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR)
free of any charges.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Justice Minister Bakari Mwapachu said Tuesday that
Ntuyahaga was arrested in Dar es Salaam Monday, hours after he was
released by the ICTR, but the minister declined to say if
Ntuyahaga would be extradited to other countries.
</P>
<P>
Ntuyahaga, a major in former Rwandan armed forces who was
accused of murdering 10 Belgian United Nations peace-keeping
soldiers and the then Prime Minister of Rwanda, was released in
Dar es Salaam Monday by the Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Belgium and Rwanda have been seeking Ntuyahaga's extradition
for trial in their courts.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Tanzania probably will charge Ntuyahaga
with violating its immigration laws by illegal entering Arusha, a
town in northern Tanzania, for surrendering to the ICTR, but has
not yet decided whether to extradite him.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the ICTR registrar said that Ntuyahaga is open to
trial by any state once he is freed.
</P>
<P>
Ntuyahaga's release, the first case in the ICTR history, is in
accordance with the decision by the ICTR Trial Chamber 1 on March
18 in which the chamber granted the prosecutor's request to drop
charges against Ntuyahaga.
</P>
<P>
"This matter is now closed as far as the tribunal is
concerned," an ICTR release read Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ntuyahaga, 47, surrendered himself to the tribunal based in
Arusha on July 10, 1998 and was indicted on September 29 with one
count, namely crime against humanity (murder).
</P>
<P>
He was allegedly responsible for disarming and arresting the 10
Belgian soldiers who were sent to escort the then Prime Minister
Agathe Uwilingiyimana before they were killed on April 7, 1994.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR Tribunal on March 18 granted the prosecution leave to
withdraw its indictment against Ntuyahaga and set him free.
</P>
<P>
But Ntuyahaga has since preferred to stay in the United Nations
 Detention Facility (UNDF) on the outskirts of Arusha where the
ICTR is based for fear of being extradited to Rwanda or Belgium
which have sought his trial in their courts.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the extradition requests to Tanzania by Belgium
and Rwanda, the ICTR Registry has said that is not a question for
the tribunal, but one between the states concerned.
</P>
<P>
Established on November 8, 1994 by the United Nationa Security
Council, the ICTR has the mandate to try persons suspected to be
responsible for genocide and other serious violations of the
international humanitarian law committed in the territory of
Rwanda between January 1 and December 31, 1994.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR has so far issued 28 indictments against 45
individuals and a total of 36 indicted individuals are in custody,
35 of them in the UNDF in Arusha and one is detained in Texas of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
About half a million Rwandans were reportedly killed during the
1994 genocide.

<P>
BONN, March 30 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
Tuesday rejected Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's proposals
for talks to end NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia, which was
brought over by Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
"The proposals brought by Prime Minister Primakov are no basis
for a political settlement,"Schroeder said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said Milosevic must send the West a clear signal of
his willingness to enter serious peace talks and to respect peace
agreements.
</P>
<P>
Primakov arrived here early Tuesday to brief Gerhard Schroeder,
who holds the EU's rotating presidency, on his six-hour talks in
Belgrade with Milosevic in a bid to bring an end NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival from a mission to Belgrade, capital of Yugoslavia,
Primakov said that Milosevic is ready for political talks if NATO
ends its air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said that Yugoslavia had six key conditions for a
reduction of its military presence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"If the (NATO) bombing stops, he is ready to reduce his
military presence in the region," Primakov told reporters through
an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
"Milosevic is ready, after the cessation of attacks, to find a
political solution to all problems," he said. Milosevic was
insisting on direct talks with the Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
"He is ready...to create the conditions for the return of all
peaceful refugees," the Russian prime minister said.Yugoslav
President Slobodan
</P>
<P>
In Belgrade, Milosevic was quoted by a state television as
saying Tuesday that he was ready to withdraw some forces from
Kosovo if NATO halted air strikes on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
After emergency talks with Primakov, he said that Belgrade
remained committed to a political settlement with separatist
Kosovo Albanians but NATO must first stop attacks on his forces.
</P>
<P>
"We remain firmly committed to a political solution through
negotiations. At the moment, the aggression against Yugoslavia
must be stopped immediately so that space opens up for a political
solution.
</P>
<P>
"As proof of our good intentions to solve Kosovo's problems
peacefully, (we) will accept a Russian proposal that, after the
halt of bombing, we scale back part of our forces present in
Kosovo to defend against aggression," Milosevic said.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton vowed Tuesday that
NATO strikes will continue despite the flood of refugees being
forced out of the province.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Stresses Importance of Revolving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has stressed the importance of the Antandikwa (starting) Fund and
urged the first beneficiaries to pay back their loans so that the
scheme can become a really sustainable program.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks Tuesday when addressing a public
rally in eastern town of Mbale which marks the end of his
eight-day tour of seven districts in the region, a press release
from the President's Office said.
</P>
<P>
Every effort should be made to eradicate poverty from
homesteads, he asserted, calling upon local people to plan their
economic activities carefully so that they can get maximum returns
in production.
</P>
<P>
The Antandikwa Fund scheme was first launched by President
Museveni in the eastern district of Kapchorwa. Under the scheme,
the government provides 30 million shillings (30,000 U.S. dollars)
to each of the 214 constituencies in the country every year.
</P>
<P>
The beneficiaries of the fund should be the poorest people in
the area. They should pay back the loan at the end of the year so
that other poor people can use it and the fund will increase in a
snow-balling way so that it can benefit all the poor people.
</P>
<P>
The scheme is part of the Ugandan government's efforts to
eradicate poverty in the country.
</P>
<P>
Now, about 46 percent of Ugandans are still living under the
poverty line, 10 percent down from the pre-Antandikwa figure.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Vice-President Specioza
Kazibwe defended herself in Parliament Tuesday over the
controversial valley dam project.
</P>
<P>
The vice president's defense includes a documentary video
showing the contested dams, Radio Uganda reported Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Kazibwe denied responsibility for the improper execution of the
plan for the construction of the 15 big valley dams, saying that
the plans were conceived far before she was given the seat in the
Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries.
</P>
<P>
Those who sat in the ministry at that time should instead take
the blame, she said.
</P>
<P>
The construction work of the dams were reportedly contracted
out to two private companies at a total cost of 2.55 billion
shillings (2.55 million U. S. dollars). The improper
implementation of the plan made at least 3.4 billion shillings
(3.4 million dollars) unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary select committee on agriculture, which is
responsible for the investigation of the valley dam scandal, has
drafted a censure motion against Kazibwe, accusing her and the the
ministers under her of failing to properly supervise the dam
project.

WASHINGTON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President-elect
Olusegun Obasanjo Tuesday held talks with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on the prospects for a new relationship under
the new Nigerian president.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official said Obasanjo will also hold talks with
President Bill Clinton later in the day. "They will discuss
bilateral relations, including regional security, and the
challenges Nigeria faces as it moves to inaugurate its first
democratic government in over 15 years," the official added.
</P>
<P>
African experts in Washington said they expected the agenda to
include national reconciliation, corruption, debt relief, foreign
investment and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
After the presidential election in Nigeria in February, the
United States lifted restrictions on visas for Nigerian officials
and certified it as a country cooperating with the United States
on drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said they expected Nigeria to seek more U.S.
assistance for the ECOMOG, the Nigerian-led peace force which has
been fighting rebels in Sierra Leone and Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The United States contributed 3.9 million dollars to ECOMOG
logistics in the 1998 financial year and 4 million dollars in the
first three months of this year, another U.S. official said.
"We're looking at ways to increase the amount," he added.
</P>

"Nigeria's regional security role is a matter of great interest
to the United States, which would like to see regional problems
solved by regional powers," said Peter Lewis of American
University's School of International Service.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians to Continue Restoring Rights: AL Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid said Tuesday the Palestinians will continue struggle
till their land is liberated and an independent state with
Jerusalem as its capital is established.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to mark the the Palestinians' Land Day,
Abdel-Meguid said Israel's rejection of the land-for-peace
principle and its failure to resume the peace talks will not
slacken the Palestinians' steadfastness in restoring their rights.
</P>
<P>
The Land Day which falls on every March 30 has been intended to
commemorate six Palestinians killed by Israeli troops in a 1976
protest against Israel's confiscation of the land of three
villages.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid also accused Israel of continuing settlement
activities on the occupied Palestinian land to impose a fait
accompli and judaize the holy city of Jerusalem, which has been
declared by Israel its capital and by the Palestinians their
future capital.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1993 Oslo Accord signed between the
Palestinians and Israel, the fate of the holy city will be
discussed in the final status talks, which have yet to start.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid hailed the position of the European Union (EU) on
the Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has hinted that he will
declare an independent state on May 4 when the five-year interim
self-rule period stipulated by the Oslo Accord expires.
</P>
<P>
The EU refrained from supporting the Palestinians to declare a
state on that particular date before the Israeli general elections
on May 17 for fear of complicating the peace process.
</P>
<P>
But the 15-nation European organization issued last Thursday a
statement, saying the Palestinians have an "unqualified right to
self-determination, including the option of a state."

<HEADLINE> Cypriots Oppose NATO Strikes Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus is organizing an all
party rally on Saturday to condemn the continuing air strikes by
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) against Yugoslavia,
the House (parliament) President Spyros Kyprianou announced
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou, who will address the rally, said the rally will send
the message that the Cypriots, who are fighting for their
own freedom, "give their full support to the same principles, the
same values and ideals in every case."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 100 people demonstrated outside the United
States and British embassies in Nicosia, both cordoned off by the
police with barbed wires.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, secondary school students also took to the
streets to protest the NATO bombardment.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus Peace Council has sent a message to United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, denouncing NATO's "inhuman raid
against the people of Yugoslavia and calls on the U.N. to take
immediate action to end it and promote a political solution to
the problem."
</P>
<P>
The NATO started the air strikes last Wednesday after
West-brokered peace talks between the Belgrade government and the
separatist ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the
population in Serbian province of Kosovo, cratered.
</P>
<P>
The air strikes aroused widespread anger among the Cypriots.
The past few days have seen protests outside the U.S. embassy
staged by Cypriots and Yugoslav nationals living in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
On March 26, about 500 people demonstrated outside the
U.S. embassy. They burned an American flag.
</P>
<P>
On march 27, some 400 protesters gathered outside the embassy,
demanding an immediate end to the air strikes. The protesters,
holding anti-NATO banners, threw eggs, tomatoes, red paint and
bottles against the embassy building.
</P>
<P>
On march 29, a group of some 500 technical school students left
classes early and gathered to march to the U.S. embassy to express
their solidarity to the Yugoslav people.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot Church announced it will be launching a huge
fund-raising campaign on April 4 in all churches across Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The administrative council of Cyprus Journalist Association
also issued a statement of condemnation to the NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides said the Cypriot
government supports a peaceful solution to the Kosovo issue. He
expressed the view that "Kosovo should remain within the borders
of Yugoslavia with some form of administrative autonomy. It is
high time the Security Council concerned itself with Kosovo."

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Reiterates Demand of Extradition of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has
reiterated its demand to the Tanzanian government to extradite
Bernard Ntuyahaga to Rwanda to face trials for the crimes against
humanity.
</P>
<P>
The Rwanda News Agency Tuesday quoted Rwandan Minister of
Justice, Jean de Dieu Mucyo, as saying that his government sent to
Tanzania a very important delegation to request the extradition of
the former Rwandan army officer to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan Minister of Foreign Affairs, Amri Sued Ismail, was also
quoted as saying that Rwanda is in close contacts with the
Tanzanian authorities to secure Ntuyahaga's extradition to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
On March 18, Rwanda had reportedly filed a request to Tanzania
asking for the extradition of the genocide suspect, after the
United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR)
had withdrawn its indictment and set Ntuyahaga free.
</P>
<P>
Ntuyahaga was accused of murdering 10 Belgian United Nations
peace- keeping soldiers and the then Prime Minister of Rwanda
</P>
<P>
However, Tanzanian Justice Minister Bakari Mwapachu said
Tuesday that the Tanzanian authorities Monday re-arrested
Ntuyahaga who was released by the ICTR free of any charges.
</P>
<P>
But Muwapachu declined to say if Ntuyahaga would be extradited
to other countries. Belgium and Rwanda have been seeking
Ntuyahaga's extradition for trial in their courts.
</P>
<P>
''Rwanda has approached the Belgian government to withdraw
their request of extradition, but nothing indicates that Belgians
will stand down,'' the Rwandan foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
He also indicated that if they wanted, the Belgians could be
associated to the trial of Ntuyahaga in Rwanda, arguing that the
genocide he is charged with was committed against Rwandans on the
Rwandan soil.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources in the Belgian Embassy in Kigali, Rwandan
capital, have disclosed that the Belgians would like to have
Ntuyahaga before April 7. Ntuyahaga ordered the killing of the 10
Belgian blue helmets, and the late Prime Minister Agathe
Umwilingiyimana five years ago.

<HEADLINE> Botswana to Withdraw Troops From Lesotho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Botswanan Deputy President
Ian Khama has said that his country would pull its troops out of
Lesotho at the end of next month, Southern African Broadcasting
Association (SABA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Khama said that the political situation in Lesotho is now
stable and that the objective of foreign troops to restore order
in the tiny mountain kingdom in southern Africa has been achieved.
</P>
<P>
But SABA did not say when Khama made the remarks.
</P>
<P>
Khama said the decision to withdraw the troops followed his
talks with South African Defense Minister Joe Modise in January.
</P>
<P>
Both Botswana and South Africa sent troops to Lesotho in
September last year in face of an imminent coup d'etat, following
disputes over election results in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Britain, in a first reaction to
reports of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's conditional
offer to withdraw his forces from Kosovo, insisted on Tuesday that
it wanted "action, not words" from Belgrade before considering an
end to air strikes.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for British Prime Minister Tony Blair said: "It's
action, not words, that counts. He (President Milosevic) knows
what he has to do."
</P>
<P>
"We have said that what he has to do is withdraw his troops.
It's important that happens. It's not a question of talking," the
spokesman was quoted as saying by local media.
</P>
<P>
President Milosevic reportedly said after talks with Russian
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov that he was ready to withdraw some
forces from Kosovo if NATO halted air strikes.

<HEADLINE> Serious Food Shortage in Angola's Kuito City: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- People in Kuito, capital city of
Angola's central Bie Province, are facing serious food shortage
due to the escalating fighting, an Angolan government official
said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The unidentified official from the Ministry of Assistance and
Social Reintegration said that there is a serious short of supply
of various essentials for daily life and the food stock managed by
the ministry in the city is only enough for 80,000 people to
consume for less than one week.
</P>
<P>
But the official noted that the refugees coming to the city
from neighboring areas have amounted to nearly 100,000 while the
United Nations agencies have stopped relief flights to the city.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. World Food Program airlifted the last batch of 17 tons
of food to Kuito on March 23 before stopping its humanitarian
flights there.
</P>
<P>
Since early March, the forces of the rebel National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) launched attacks against
the Angolan government troops in some towns around Kuito and
Huambo, capital city of Huambo Province. The fighting in Kuito
was the most fierce one.
</P>
<P>
Because of the renewed civil war in the southern African
country, the number of the internally-displaced people has
increased up to 1.5 million and they are living in dire situation.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan Ministry of Assistance and Social Reintegration has
recently initiated a 30-day national relief program to help the
war victims in various ways.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Indicates Yugoslavia's Claim to Kosovo at Stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton, while
vowing to proceed with attacks on Yugoslavia, threatened on
Tuesday that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic could pay the
price of his claim to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to stay with our policy," Clinton said in
remarks at a State Department ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He said the NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia were designed to
"raise price" of Milosevic's resistance to Western-imposed Kosovo
peace deal.
</P>
<P>
"If there was ever any doubt about what is at stake in Kosovo,
Mr. Milosevic is certainly erasing it by his actions," Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
"He faces... the prospect of international support for Serbia's
claim to Kosovo increasingly jeopardized," he added. "We must
remain steady and determined with will to see this through."
</P>
<P>
The United States has opposed independence moves in Kosovo,
supporting Serbia's claim to the province. During the Rambouillet
peace talks, the Clinton administration supported autonomy, but
not independence, for the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Clinton did not mention a Yugoslav peace offer made to Russian
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, which U.S. officials said was
being assessed in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic said earlier in a statement in Belgrade that he would
scale down the Serbian force in Kosovo on the condition that NATO
stops bombing.
</P>
<P>
"As proof of our good intentions to solve Kosovo's problems
peacefully, we will accept a Russian proposal that, after the halt
of bombing, we scale back part of our forces present in Kosovo to
defend against aggression," he said through Serbian state
television.
</P>
<P>
Washington has not made any response to the Yugoslav
president's statement, but some analysts here said the Clinton
administration was unlikely to accept the offer.

<HEADLINE> Blood Donors Needed in Hangzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Hospitals in Hangzhou have been
hit by a sharp decline in blood donors which has resulted in a
critical shortage of blood for clinical use.
</P>
<P>
This follows the introduction of a national law last October
which banned commercial batches of blood being used in hospitals,
which had previously kept their blood banks topped up.
</P>
<P>
The problem is rife in China even despite a major promotion to
encourage blood donors was launched in 1984 but has been described
as having suffered a "sluggish" response.
</P>
<P>
One of the major reasons, according to health officials, is a
deeply-rooted opinion amongst Chinese people, which has been
proved wrong, that donating blood may be harmful to health.
</P>
<P>
Now in a bid to combat the lack of supplies in Hangzhou, a
local law to encourage citizens to donate blood was passed by the
legislators of east China's Zhejiang Province here today during a
Standing Committee meeting of the Ninth Provincial People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
It stipulates that, following the guidelines laid down by the
national Blood Donation Law, workers in government departments,
people in the military, medical workers and university students in
Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang, have an obligation to provide blood
free of charge.
</P>
<P>
As a result blood donors and their relatives will enjoy certain
privileges if they need blood and when hospitalized while non-
donors will have to pay.

<HEADLINE> Blair Says Progress Made in N.Irish Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said the discussions over decommissioning in Northern Ireland on
Wednesday had produced movement toward a deal.
</P>
<P>
 "We believe good progress has been made here but there is
still more to do," he said before leaving Belfast early in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The message of hope came on the second morning of crunch talks
in a Hillsborough castle near Belfast attended by the province's
main political leaders.
</P>
<P>
"If progress can be made, we stand ready to return and take
these discussions to a successful conclusion," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
The British prime minister and his Irish counterpart Bertie
Ahern joined the Northern Ireland peace talks these past two days
in an attempt to end the stalemate over decommissioning in the
province.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone wants this agreement to work. We need to get the
details firmed up during the day," Blair added.
</P>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister Ahern went further, suggesting the
outstanding matters related only to timing. "Surely we should not
lose out because two of the parties could not agree on times and
dates," he said before heading to Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Wednesday, the outlawed Irish Republican Army IRA)
issued its Easter statement insisting the peace process can work.
</P>
<P>
"The IRA guns are silent. If the political will exists, the
peace process contains potential to resolve the conflict and
deliver a real peace," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The pro-British Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble has
consistently refused to sit in an executive with IRA's political
wing Sinn Fein until the IRA start to hand over its arms.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Urges Good Implementation of Macao Basic Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official said here
Wednesday that people both in Macao and the inland areas of China
should exert more efforts to ensure a good implementation of the
Macao Basic Law in the future Macao Special Administrative Region
(SAR).
</P>
<P>
"The Basic Law is an essential guarantee for Macao's long-term
stability and development," Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua
News Agency Macao Branch, said on the occasion of the sixth
anniversary of the issuance of the law.
</P>
<P>
The law was enacted by the National People's Congress of China
following widespread consultations among Macao residents.
</P>
<P>
Wang noted that only 264 days are left before December 20 when
Macao will return to the motherland and the Basic Law will be put
into effect.
</P>
<P>
"Time is limited and we must work harder," he told two groups
of correspondents coming from China's Guangdong province.
</P>
<P>
Organized by many social organizations, people from all walks
of life in Macao have done a lot of effective work to publicize
the Macao Basic Law over the past six years. Therefore, people in
Macao have become more and more familiar with the law.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the study and publicity of the law has been
popular in the inland areas of China. "The law is a national one.
Not only should it be implemented in Macao, but it also should be
observed in other parts of China," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
With the participation of some social bodies from Macao, "Macao
Publicity Weeks" have been held in many inland cities including
Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, Fuzhou, Xi'an and Shijiazhuang. "
Macao's return to the motherland has become a big event attracting
the attention of the masses of people in the inland areas," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"To safeguard the authority of the Basic Law and to build the
future SAR into a society based on the rule of law are conducive
to achieving China's grand goal of governing the country according
to law and will act as a reliable guarantee for Macao's lasting
stability and development," Wang Qiren said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that many issues have to be handled well before
the transfer of power from Portugal to China, such as the
localization of civil servants and the law, the use of Chinese as
an official language, the transfer of government assets and
archives and the payment of pension to civil servants.
</P>
<P>
These matters are related to Macao's steady transition and
smooth handover, he said, adding "they are vital to the good
implementation of the Macao Basic Law in the future SAR."

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Lawyers Demand Immediate End to Attacks on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnam Lawyers' Association
Wednesday issued a declaration, vehemently protesting NATO's acts
and demanding an immediate end to all military actions against the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The declaration also demanded resumption of political
negotiations for a peaceful and just solution to the Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"This action outrageously and seriously violates the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia's independence, sovereignty and national
integrity. It causes a lot of heavy losses and grave consequences
to the lives of Yugoslavian people," the declaration said. It
added that the action also blatantly violates the United Nations
Charter and international law.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam Lawyers' Association stressed in its declaration
that in international relations among states as well as in the
relations between international organizations and their members,
the principle of mutual respect is the highest condition which
must be observed by all states and international organizations.
</P>
<P>
It said that no one is allowed to unilaterally use its military
power to attack a sovereign state without a decision by the United
Nations Security Council in accordance with the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
"NATO's military attacks on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
further complicate the handling of the Kosovo issue, create a
dangerous precedent in international relations, cause tension in
the Balkan region, and threaten peace not only in Europe but also
in the world as a whole," the Vietnamese Lawyers' Association
said.
</P>
<P>
The association called on lawyers all over the world to raise
their voice in support of the U.N. Charter and the principle of
not to threat the use of force or to use force in international
relations and to condemn NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia as well as
violations of international law and general practices in
international relations.

<HEADLINE> 3,000 Tons of Toxic Waste to Depart From Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Sihanoukville's mercury-laden
waste is ready for shipping to the U.S. within two days after
repackaging was finished on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony was held here to mark the end of the cleanup
operation. Deputy Prime Minister Sar Kheng attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the waste would be shipped to California.
</P>
<P>
Some 160 Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF) soldiers took part
in the cleanup operation. Three thousand tons of toxic waste plus
2,000 tons of top-soil taken from the toxic waste hilltop were
repackaged into 18,000 oil barrels which were stored in more than
350 containers.
</P>
<P>
The toxic waste, dumped on a hill 15 km from Sihanoukville town
 early last December, was shipped from a Taiwanese company and
caused a panic in the seaside town.
</P>
<P>
After more than two months of dispute and negotiations,
Taiwan's Formosa Plastic Corp. signed an agreement in late
February with the Cambodian government, agreeing to transport the
waste out of Cambodia within 60 days or face fines of up to 5,000
U.S. dollars a day.
</P>
<P>
The cleanup is thought to have cost the company some 2.5
million dollars.

</P>
<P>
The official told the press on Tuesday that the worst affected
regions are Mudug and Nugal where water scarcity is forcing the
nomads to gather around the main towns thus further devastating
the already poor economy and draining the local resources.
</P>
<P>
The government is planning to open refugee camps for the
destitute people and launch a water distribution campaign for
those still in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities in Puntland have earlier forwarded their
outcry to the international aid agencies for humanitarian
assistance, "but only WFP (World Food Program) said they will
offer 2000 sacks of flour which is far too less to cover even the
immediate needs," said Farah.
</P>
<P>
"We won't be able to distribute such a small amount of food to
the innumerable affected people." "But all we will be able to do
is to move the people from the waterless areas around the main
towns."
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, a water giving campaign has been launched by the
International Committee for the Red Cross in the regions of Mudug
and Nugal early in the month.
</P>
<P>
In a seven-day watering campaign, the Red Cross has offered
over 320 water tanks to the villages far in the Mudug and Nugal
regions. The water was distributed among the water troughs in the
villages as well as in the countryside where the nomads brought
about all the utensils they could to take the water for
themselves as well as to their camels and goats.
</P>
<P>
Also in the other neighboring region of Galgudud, the rainy
seasons are yet to fall despite the preparation of the subsistence
farmers for their seasonal cultivation of sorghum and beans.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities of the region are similarly expressing
concern that only heavy rains will relieve the catastrophic
situation.

<P>
HANGZHOU, March 31 (Xinhua) -- New, stricter regulations for
noise control were approved today by the municipal legislative
body of Hangzhou, capital of east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say that the new rules are necessary because,
with the improvement of people's living standards, urban noise
problems are having greater effects on citizens. They say that
former regulations, issued in 1987, no longer meet current
requirements.
</P>
<P>
And with many residents remodeling and renovating their houses
day and night quarrels are beginning to break out among neighbors
because of the loud noise involved.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations will allow those affected by noise to
report any incidents to local environmental protection agencies
which have the authority to prosecute offenders.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Boost Exports of Agro-forest Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is making efforts to boost
the export of agro-forest products, Vietnam News Agency (VNA)
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam plans to earn 3.3 billion U.S. dollars from the export
of agricultural and forest products this year, said VNA.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 figure was 2.9 billion dollars, accounting for 29
percent of the country's total export value.
</P>
<P>
However, according to Vietnam's General Department of
Statistics, the export of farm produce in the first quarter of
this year declined compared with last year. For example, rice
export was down 41.2 percent while the export of coffee, tea,
cashew nuts also decreased.
</P>
<P>
The Department for Agro-Forest Product Processing and Rural
Occupations under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development of Vietnam put forward a proposal for tax exemption
for new farm produce processing establishments for a period of 2
to 5 years. The ministry also asked the state to exempt the
newly-earmarked material areas for processing industry from
agricultural tax, and offer other incentives.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is planning to take more measures to expand markets for
farm produce. Vietnam will start promoting exports to traditional
markets in ASEAN countries, Russia and Eastern Europe and seek for
new markets in America and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has set export targets for the year 2010, including
4-4.5 million tons of rice for 1.3 billion dollars turnover,
550,000-600,000 tons of coffee for 1.2 billion dollars,
350,000-380,000 tons of rubber for more than 300 million dollars,
and 150,000 tons of dried tea for 300 million dollars, and 2,000
tons of processed vegetables and 2,500 tons of processed fruit for
300 million dollars.

<P>
OTTAWA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Canada is sending six more CF-18
fighter jets to join in intensifying NATO air strikes against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Defense Minister Art Eggleton said Tuesday that the
fighter jets, currently in the Netherlands, will join six Canadian
CF-18s already stationed in Aviano, Italy, within two or three
days.
</P>
<P>
The CF-18s in Aviano have taken part in the air strikes against
Yugoslavia since NATO launched its first wave of air strikes last
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Air strikes against Yugoslavia "will have to be turned up," and
NATO needs more military equipment to do the job, Canadian Foreign
Minister Lloyd Axworthy said in Ottawa.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Send Warships to Mediterranean: Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Russia is planning to send
warships to the Mediterranean to protest NATO air strikes on
Yugoslavia, following its failed attempt to broker peace between
the two sides Tuesday, said Russian news agencies.
</P>
<P>
The seven ships to be sent to the Mediterranean in early April
will include missile frigates and anti-submarine frigates from the
Black Sea fleet, the Interfax and ITAR-Tass News Agency reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, there has been no confirmation of the report from the
Russian navy authority.
</P>
<P>
The deployment of Russian warships in the Mediterranean would
highlight its disapproval of what it sees as the intervention into
Yugoslavia's internal affairs by NATO, whose warships are deployed
in the region for operations against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government has strongly condemned NATO's action by
suspending all contacts with the alliance and recalling its
representative to the alliance. However, it has ruled out any
conflict with NATO.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov failed in his efforts to bring
Belgrade and NATO to the negotiating table during his talks with
Yugoslav President Slobodon Milosevic and German leaders Tuesday.
But he promised that Moscow would continue its mediation efforts.

<HEADLINE> 4.1 Bln Dollar Deficit for Current Fiscal Year in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) announced here Wednesday it
has a deficit of 31,985 million HK dollars (about 4.1 billion U.S.
dollars) for the first 11 months in the current fiscal year ended
February 28, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Expenditure for the current fiscal year by February 28 amounts
to 210.4 billion HK dollars (about 27 billion U.S. dollars) and
revenue amounted to 178.4 billion (about 22.9 billion U.S. dollars
</P>
<P>
The deficit is 4.5 billion HK dollars, or about 577 million U.S.
dollars, higher than that for the period to January.
</P>
<P>
After taking into account the increase in the net worth of the
Land Fund, the deficit for the fiscal year 1998-99 ending February,
1999, was 23.7 billion HK dollars (about three billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Donald Tsang announced in his
Budget Speech on March 3, 1999, that he expected the deficit for
1998-99 to amount to 32.3 billion HK dollars (4.19 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The fiscal reserves stood at 433.9 billion HK dollars (about 55.
6 billion U.S.) as of February 28, 1999, a decrease of 23.7
billion HK dollars (about three billion U.S. dollars compared with
the level as of March 31, 1998, the end of the previous fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
An SAR government spokesman said that the results for the first
11 months reflect the effect of the package of special relief
measures announced on June 22, 1998, as well as a general slow-
down in revenue collections as a result of the economic downturn.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Greek Leaders Voice Concerns Over World Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and Greek leaders voiced
their profound concerns over world peace here Wednesday as air
strikes by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) against
Yugoslavia escalated.
</P>
<P>
With the end of the Cold War, the world has failed again to
become a place of peace, as conflicts triggered by various causes
continue to occur from time to time, said Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China,
during his meeting with Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos.
</P>
<P>
Cases of interference in the internal affairs of other
countries under various pretexts were not rare, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived here on Tuesday on a four-day official visit. It is
the first leg of his six-nation tour which will also take him to
Turkey, Syria, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Some people who always claim they respect human rights are
currently bombing the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia relentlessly,
killing innocent civilians, leaving tens of thousands homeless and
depriving them of their basic rights of existence, the Chinese
leader pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Is this a way of protecting human rights?" he questioned.
</P>
<P>
President Stephanopoulos said Europe is now faced with many
complicated problems, which cast a dark shadow over the future
prospects of Europe.
</P>
<P>
The escalation of the Yugoslavia crisis is threatening the
security of Europe as a whole, the president said, noting that it
was horribly sad that a large number of people were wounded and
killed during the NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
The president said that Greece does not want to see the further
worsening of the situation in Yugoslavia, as the refugee problem,
which arose in the wake of the NATO air strikes, has become a big
headache for Greece.
</P>
<P>
Greece maintains that the dispute should be settled in
accordance with international norms, the authority of the United
Nations should be respected, and the U.N. Security Council should
play a greater role.
</P>
<P>
Greece opposes any military action against a sovereign nation
which bypasses the United Nations, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Greek leader pointed out that small nations are more
sensitive to being unfairly treated in world affairs. Therefore,
he said, Greece appreciates China's proposition that all countries
should be equal, regardless of their size, and China's call for an
early establishment of the new world order.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said that there are three important principles in
China's independent foreign policy for peace: that all disputes
between countries should be solved through negotiations and should
not resort to force; that the internal affairs of a country should
not be interfered with by other countries; and that every country,
whether it is strong or weak, rich or poor, is an equal member of
the international community, and its sovereignty and territorial
integrity should be respected.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Daily Hails Jiang's Successful European Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
visit to Italy, Switzerland and Austria has deepened mutual
understanding and given a strong impetus to bilateral relations
and cooperation between them, a leading Chinese newspaper said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial commenting on the March 20-30 visit, the
official People's Daily said that the visit will have a great
influence on China's relations with those countries and Europe as
a whole.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Jiang held in-depth discussions with his
counterparts on bilateral ties and international issues. He also
briefed them on China's domestic and foreign policies and its
achievements in reform and opening up.
</P>
<P>
He also met the representatives of the business communities and
toured some companies and institutions, especially the high-tech
ones.
</P>
<P>
China and Europe share common interests in maintaining world
peace and promoting common economic development. With their
economies mutually complementary, China and Europe have many
favorable conditions to enhance cooperation in the economic, trade,
science, technology and cultural areas.
</P>
<P>
Jiang reached a consensus with the leaders of the three
European countries. He highlighted their strong will to further
strengthen bilateral cooperation, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
On many occasions during his three-nation European tour,
particularly at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, the paper
said Jiang exhibited a "profound" analysis of the current
international situation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, quoted by the paper, said that, generally speaking, the
current international situation continues to ease up, but regional
conflicts and a good many destabilizing factors still exist. The
Cold War mentality still lingers on as hegemonism and power
politics manifest themselves from time to time. The tendency
toward closer military alliances is on the rise. New forms of "
gunboat diplomacy" are rampant.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that a changing world needs a new international
order accordingly. To this end, the Chinese president advocated
the cultivation of a new world security concept with mutual trust,
mutual benefits, equality and cooperation at the core. He also
called for the stepping-up of the disarmament process and the
maintenance of global security.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also elaborated on his opinion on promoting the
establishment of a new peaceful, stable, fair and reasonable world
political and economic order.
</P>
<P>
He repeatedly emphasized the principles of mutual respect for
sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-
interference in each other's internal affairs and political
solution to any international dispute.
</P>
<P>
As for NATO's military attacks on Yugoslavia, Jiang urged the
immediate cessation of the Western military bloc's military
intervention so as to bring the Kosovo issue back to the course of
political solution as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's stance on Kosovo and his views on state-to-state
relations and global security are of "vital and far-reaching
significance" in helping the international situation move toward
relaxation and creating a new world order, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Poultry Free of Flu Virus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- China's quarantine officials have
tightened up the inspection of Hong Kong bound fowl exports since
the Agriculture and Fisheries Department (AFD) of the HK Special
Administrative Region said earlier this month that it had
discovered examples of the H5N1 virus in excrement samples taken
from ducks and geese.
</P>
<P>
However, after carrying out extensive tests the authorities
insist they have not detected the virus, which is a form of flu,
in inland poultry farms or among birds supplied to Hong Kong and
Macao.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, according to the State Administration for Entry-Exit
Inspection and Quarantine, no cases of bird-to-human transmission
of the H5N1 virus had been discovered after a year long inspection
among some 200 million chickens, ducks, geese and pigeons in
inland areas.
</P>
<P>
But exports of Chinese poultry were seriously affected after
local press in Hong Kong reported the alleged claims.
</P>
<P>
China's quarantine officials insisted that for every batch of
poultry being shipped to Hong Kong and Macao there had to be a
minimum of 13 blood samples taken to test for H5N1. Sterilization
and supervision work during the shipment was also strengthened.
</P>
<P>
"The central government has always paid close attention to the
health of poultry supplied for Hong Kong residents, and the state
administration has worked closely with the AFD on this matter to
ensure that a clean bill of health is given the 42 million birds
bound for Hong Kong every year," a Chinese quarantine spokesman
stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC), met
Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis here Wednesday, with both
sides spoke highly of the relations between the two countries and
sharing common or similar views on international issues.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed his satisfaction with the development of relations
between the two countries, saying that Sino-Greek relations have
enjoyed smooth development since the establishment of diplomatic
ties in 1972.
</P>
<P>
He praised Greece's support for China in the issues of human
rights, Taiwan and Tibet, as well as China's efforts to enter the
World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader said the good political relations between
China and Greece have created favorable conditions for the further
development of economic and trade ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
On international issues, Li said multi-polarization and
economic globalization are the main tendencies of the contemporary
world. China hopes the multi-polarization and economic
globalization will be conducive to safeguarding world peace and
stability as well as international cooperation and development on
the basis of equality and mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
As for China's domestic issues, Li stressed that China attaches
equal importance to the political reforms as well as the economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Simitis said that Greece, a member of NATO and the European
Union, sticks to a multi-facet foreign policy and puts great
emphasis on its relationship with China.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Kosovo, he expressed his worry about the crisis,
adding that his country supports a peaceful solution to the
problem.
</P>
<P>
He also called for respect by NATO of the international laws to
help maintain peace and stability in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The differences of development in the Balkan countries should
be recognized and foreign countries should not interfere in the
internal affairs of other counties under the pretext of human
rights.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived here Tuesday afternoon for a four-day official visit
to Greece, the first leg of his six-nation tour which will also
bring him to Turkey, Syria, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Open Rice Market With Tariff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Japan will open its rice market
beginning the next fiscal year, but it will impose high tariffs on
imported rice to protect its domestic rice growers.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Diet (parliament) on Wednesday enacted a bill aimed at
introducing tariffs on rice imports beginning April 1 of fiscal
year 1999.
</P>
<P>
The law, which will take effect Thursday, allows Japan's
private sector to import rice freely under the tariff scheme.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time in 68 years that importing rice is
deregulated. Japan's rice imports have been under government
controls since 1931. Currently, the Japanese government's Food
Agency imports rice under a quota system.
</P>
<P>
The tariff, which the government says is imposed in conformity
with the World Trade Organization's agricultural agreement, is set
at 351.17 yen (about 2.9 dollars) per kilogram for fiscal 1999,
making imported rice more expensive than most Japanese-brand rice.
</P>
<P>
With the adoption of the tariff, Japan will be allowed to
reduce the amount of rice imported by the Food Agency under a 1993
multilateral accord reached under the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT), the WTO's predecessor.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government was obliged under the GATT accord to
import 4 percent of its rice consumption in fiscal 1995 and to
gradually increase the share over a six-year period to 8 percent
in fiscal 2000.
</P>
<P>
The switch to tariffs allows Japan to slow down the annual
import growth from 0.8 percentage point to 0.4 percentage point in
each of the final two years of the accord.
</P>
<P>
The rice tariff plan, unveiled in December, 1998, has drawn
fire from three rice producing countries including Australia, a
major exporter of rice to Japan, and the European Union.

<HEADLINE> Pollution Control in Dianchi Lake Speeds Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- China has speeded up pollution
control in the Dianchi Lake, the sixth largest of China's
freshwater lakes in southwest China's Yunnan Province, to ensure
it is improved before the World Horticulture Exposition starts on
May 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
The famous lake, on a high plateau which covers 307 square
kilometers, plays a key role in balancing the ecological
environment in Kunming, the provincial capital and venue of the
exposition.
</P>
<P>
In order to make industrial enterprises, hotels and restaurants
around the lake meet state standards on the release of pollutants,
a "Zero Hour Mission" was launched today.
</P>
<P>
Those who fail to meet the laid down standards at the deadline
of zero hour on April 30 will be forced to close down.
</P>
<P>
Among the 253 enterprises listed as major polluters in the area,
122 have now passed inspections by environmental protection
agencies while a further 77 have introduced pollution control
systems and are awaiting inspection.
</P>
<P>
However, according to a local official, four enterprises have
not even started to take any pollution control action yet and are
being closely watched.

<HEADLINE> Tanker Collision Pollutes South China Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 square kilometers of
the South China Sea have suffered bad pollution after a cargo ship
collided with an oil tanker which spilled 150 tons of 'heavy'
crude oil into the water.
</P>
<P>
The collision took place in the small hours of March 24 in the
sea near the city of Zhuhai in south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Official sources say that more than 260 ha of fish farms have
been polluted, leading to direct economic losses of 1.05 million
yuan. And some 130 ha of oyster farms have also been polluted,
with large numbers of oysters expected to die within weeks.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Environmental Protection Bureau of Zhuhai
City said that an investigation into the cause of the collision is
still ongoing.
</P>
<P>
He said that although emergency measures have been taken to
tackle the pollution no effective means have been found to
completely combat the impact within a short period of time because
heavy oil is relatively sticky and hard to disperse.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense minister Chi
Haotian held talks here today with Cambodia's joint defense
ministers Tea Banh and Prince Sisowath Sereyrath.
</P>
<P>
Chi, who is also vice-chairman of China's Central Military
Commission, explained that at present the global trend is towards
detente and stability, with the main focus being on peace and
economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
"However, the world is still constantly threatened by hegemony
and power politics. It is good, therefore, that the pursuit of
peace and development are important factors for most countries in
drafting out their policies," Chi added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting that he valued the latest developments in Sino-
Cambodian relations, Chi stressed that China attaches great
importance to enhancing relations between the two countries and
their armed forces.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to work together with our counterparts in Cambodia to
promote mutual understanding and trust, and to enhance friendship
and cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tea Banh gave a brief outline to his hosts about the current
situation in Cambodia. He told how the newly organized congress
and government are functioning normally and intend to make
Cambodia a country based on the rule of law. "The welcome ending
of a civil war which lasted for years has provided a perfect
chance for unification and national reconciliation, as well as
social and economic development," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And the Cambodian government, army and people are grateful for
the enormous support China renders, both in spirit and materially,
" Tea Banh added.
</P>
<P>
He also reaffirmed that Cambodia supports the "one China"
policy.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Little Changed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar finished
little changed Wednesday, despite dipping a touch in early trade
due to weaker metal prices in London.
</P>
<P>
Colonial State Bank treasury manager Nick Volanakis said the
domestic currency recovered during the afternoon, helped along by
some buying out of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
At the close the Australian dollar was trading at 62.98 U.S.
cents from Tuesday night's finish of 62.93, after spending the day
between 62.65 and 63.00.
</P>
<P>
"It started off weak with just spill over from weak
commodities, particularly metal prices," Volanakis said.
</P>
<P>
On the London Metal Exchange Tuesday night, copper fell 30.50
U.S. dollars per ton, tin fell 60 U.S. dollars, lead fell 10.50
U.S. dollars and zinc fell 49.50 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Retail trade figures out Wednesday came in better than expected
but Volanakis said this was probably not the main driver of the
afternoon recovery in the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that retail trade
for February fell a seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent, following
January's startling 5.2 percent advance.
</P>
<P>
Also at the close, the Australian dollar was buying 0.5861 euro
from 0.5860 euro Tuesday, while the Australian dollar was trading
Japanese yen at 75.68 from 75.53 Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Launches Air Pollution Control Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Beijing is to boost efforts to
tackle air pollution, so as to celebrate the coming 50th
anniversary of the founding of New China with a clean environment,
Wang Guangtao, deputy mayor of Beijing, said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection
Commission, Wang pointed out that although the capital's air
quality has improved considerably since late last year, when local
authorities began to tackle problem, it is still not satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
A major part of the campaign will be to control the spread of
dust and plant grass and foliage on waste ground, which according
to Wang totals approximately six million sq meters.
</P>
<P>
The authorities will also encourage more use of natural gas and
tighten up regulations concerning automobile exhaust emissions.

<HEADLINE> French President Rejects Idea of Kosovo Breaking Away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
rejected the idea of Kosovo breaking away from Yugoslavia, because
that would bring about profound instability in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Chirac made the declaration one day after U.S. President Bill
Clinton warned Yugoslavia that what was happening in Kosovo would
put into question its sovereignty over the province.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with members of a support group for Kosovo
Albanians, "Committee Kosovo," Chirac said the consequences of a
NATO intervention, including a humanitarian disaster, were "
foreseen" by Western leaders.
</P>
<P>
He said the NATO operation against Yugoslavia is "an affair
which will last long" and which needs patience, according to "
Committee Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
But the French president said that he would not even think
Kosovo breaking away from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also refused to comment on reports that NATO is
preparing to send ground forces to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
France, Britain and the United States are reportedly sending
small groups of their commando special units into Kosovo to carry
out "punctual attacks" against Serb forces.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Favors NATO Air Strikes Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu Tuesday expressed support for the ongoing NATO air
strikes against Yugoslavia, breaking the diplomatic ambiguity over
the last few days.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot remain silence in the face of the crime (in
Kosovo)," Netanyahu was quoted by Israel Radio as saying.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came after the government was fiercely criticized
by opposition blocs and diplomatic experts for its neutrality on
the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
Since NATO launched its aerial bombardment on Yugoslavia last
Wednesday, the government has refrained from taking sides in the
crisis, from singling out a party to blame.
</P>
<P>
Some say that the assistance extended to Jews by the Serbs
during the Holocaust in World War II has played a key role in
Israel's decision not to denounce them.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties have rapped what they called the
"thundering silence" of the government on the reported massacres
taking place in Kosovo, saying Israel should have unequivocally
supported the NATO air strikes on Serb targets in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has denied allegations that he had failed to express
explicit approval for the NATO actions so as not to antagonize
Russians, close allies of the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn all mass killing, whether it is done by the Serbs
or by anyone else," he declared.
</P>
<P>
The government decided at a special cabinet session Tuesday to
send medicine, blankets and clothes to Kosovo refugees in Albania.
</P>
<P>
But the planned flight loaded with the supplies was scrapped
Tuesday night at the last minute as the air space in the Balkans
has been closed by NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
The plane will possibly leave for Albania Thursday night, said
Israel Radio.

At present there are approximately 100,000 Afghan refugees in

The residents of the area, who welcome the sealing of border,

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senator Says U.S. And China Need Frank Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Senator Craig Thomas, chairman of
the East Asia and Pacific Affairs Subcommittee of the US Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, said here today that the United
States and China need more frank and candid dialogues to increase
mutual understanding and to find solutions to their problems.
</P>
<P>
Thomas, a republican from the state of Wyoming, told Xinhua
that there are a lot of issues on both sides that need to be dealt
with, including trade relations, Taiwan, Tibet, and human rights.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he said that he disagrees with the opinion
expressed by some media that U.S.-China relations have been ebbing.
"It is rather a downturn from a year ago, but I don't view it as
long-term deterioration," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thomas, who has visited China three times, said he believes
that there is value in getting together, cooperating and having an
opportunity for discussions in an honest and open way between the
United States and China. He urged that this process be speeded up.
</P>
<P>
"We have a little too much of stand-offs in our relationship
instead of exploring issues frankly," Thomas said, and suggested
the establishment of a joint group in charge of examining the
facts.
</P>
<P>
Over time, it is in the interest of both countries to overcome
their problems, he emphasized and said "we don't expect everyone
to be the same, but we should deal with each other and find some
solutions."
</P>
<P>
Thomas, Senator Gorden Smith and Representative Greg Walden,
left Beijing this evening for Shanghai to continue their China
tour.

<HEADLINE> 4.1 Bln US Dollar Deficit Recorded for Current </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) announced here Wednesday it
has a deficit of 31,985 (rpt31,985) million HK dollars (4.1
billion U.S. dollars) for the first 11 months in the current
fiscal year ended February 28, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Expenditure for the current fiscal year by February 28 amounts
to 210.4 billion HK dollars (27.0 billion U.S. dollars) and
revenue to 178.4 billion (22.9 billion U.S.).
</P>
<P>
The deficit is 4.5 billion HK dollars, or 577 million U.S.
dollars, higher than that for the period to January.
</P>
<P>
After taking into account the increase in the net worth of the
Land Fund, the deficit for the year 1998-99 ending February, 1999,
was 23.7 billion HK dollars (3.0 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Donald Tsang announced in his
Budget Speech on March 3, 1999, that he expected the deficit for
1998-99 to amount to 32.3 billion HK dollars (4.19 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The fiscal reserves stood at 433.9 billion HK dollars (55.6
billion U.S.) as of February 28, 1999, a decrease of 23.7 billion
HK dollars (3.0 billion U.S.) compared with the level as of March
31, 1998, the end of the previous financial year.
</P>
<P>
An SAR government spokesman said that the results for the first
11 months reflect the effect of the package of special relief
measures announced on June 22, 1998, as well as a general
slow-down in revenue collections as a result of the economic
downturn.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Calls for Arms Embargo on Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Wednesday renewed call
for arms embargo on Afghanistan, saying foreign intervention and
supply of weapons are main causes of relentless hostilities in the
war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Replying to questions, Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shamshad
Ahmed said Pakistan has floated a proposal to punish those who
violate the embargo under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
Without naming any country, Shamshad said some U.N. members
opposed the idea and added that "those countries which objected to
arms embargo proposal in fact were supplying arms to the warring
groups" in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad refuted the allegation that Pakistan is interfering in
Afghanistan's internal affairs and said that Islamabad has been
striving to bring the warring factions to the negotiation table so
that they could reach an agreement on the formation of a
broad-based government in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan's sincerity and non-interference policy can be well
judged from the suggestion made for a complete arms embargo on
Afghan warring factions," he added.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad told reporters that Pakistan still hosts some 1.3
million Afghan refugees and would be directly affected if the
crisis in Afghanistan continues.
</P>
<P>
He described the peace talks between warring Afghan factions in
Ashgabad this month as positive development and said Pakistan has
always encouraged dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad dispelled the impression that Pakistan and Iran are
engaged in cold war over the Afghan issue, saying that both
countries are desirous of lasting peace in Afghanistan because
they are the affected countries of the civil war in that country.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan had deep-rooted ties with Iran and the
question of cold war between the two does not underline the need
for close Pak-Iran coordination for restoration of peace in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad admitted that Pakistan had some difficulties with Iran
concerning Afghanistan but observed that these problems are
gradually removing as the two neighboring countries are desirous
to see peace in Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Forest Fires Stalk Southeast Asia Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Forest fires are stalking
Southeast Asian countries and the world as a whole, a
recently-released annual report of the United Nations Environment
Program (UNEP) reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The report based its assessment on the forest fires in
Southeast Asia and some other areas in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
In Asia, the report said Indonesia was worst affected, although
fires also raged in Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The report said international support augmented local efforts
to put out the fires in 1997, but continuing drought conditions in
1998 led to the fires again spreading out of control.
</P>
<P>
In February, Klaus Topfer, the UNEP executive director,
attended a meeting of environment ministers of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to discuss how the UNEP could
help.
</P>
<P>
In recognition of the scale and duration of the forest fires,
the report said U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan asked Topfer to
coordinate the U.N. response to the emergency.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Receives Invitation to Co-host 2000 Africa Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria Football Association (NFA)
has confirmed that it had received an official invitation from the
Confederation of Africa Football (CAF) to co-host 2000 African
Nations Cup with neighboring Ghana.
</P>
<P>
The continental football body announced Nigeria and Ghana as co-
hosts of the next edition of the African Nations Cup after it took
the hosting rights away from Zimbabwe early this month, The
Guardian reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the Nigerian football and government officials refused
to make an official response to the CAF'S invitation, citing lack
of official invitation as reason.
</P>
<P>
NFA got CAF's official invitation on Tuesday to host the Africa
Nations Cup with Ghana and CAF gave an April 10 ultimatum to
Nigeria to respond to the invitation.
</P>
<P>
Austin Mgbolu, FNA spokesman, confirmed the reception of the
CAF's invitation and said that Nigeria response to the invitation
would be made at the appropriate time.
</P>
<P>
NFA Chairman Col. Abdulmumuni Aminu had expressed happiness
over the invitation to co-host the football tourney with Ghana.
</P>
<P>
However, government sources revealed that Nigeria may not
accept CAF's invitation to co-host Nations Cup with Ghana as it is
generally believed that Nigeria has the facilities to solely host
the tourney and could do so without any assistance.
</P>
<P>
A football staff of Nigeria said, "If we can host 24 nations of
the world, I don't see any reason why we cannot host 16 nations
from Africa."
</P>
<P>
Amos Admu, director in the sports ministry, said the government
will soon make an official announcement on the request.

LONDON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Lennox Lewis may have to
wait until November for a heavyweight title rematch with Evander
Holyfield, Lewis' promoter Panos Eliades said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, Eliades said: "Evander's signed
up with Don King and Don is talking to me about doing a rematch
possibly as late as November of this Year.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wants the fight. I've had offers from Saudi Arabia,
I've had offers from South Africa. But Las Vegas is the one that
really wants the fight and they are pushing the price sky high.
King also wants to keep it in America."
</P>
<P>
The first clash between WBC champion Lewis and WBA and IBF
champion Holyfield was widely derided with most observers
concluding that the Briton had outpointed the American.
</P>
<P>
A US Grand Jury is investigating whether or not the judges took
illegal payments.
</P>
<P>
King said earlier this month that both sides were working
towards a rematch in September.

<HEADLINE> Record Number of Parties to Run for Next Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A record number of 33 parties
will run for the next Knesset (Parliament) in the May elections
in Israel, raising the possibility that the 15th Knesset will be
further fragmented.
</P>
<P>
All these parties had presented their Knesset lists to the
Central Election Committee by Tuesday midnight, the deadline for
registration of parties and prime minister candidates.
</P>
<P>
There are six candidates for the premiership. Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu of Likud, Ehud Barak of the One Israel alliance
and Yitzhak Mordechai of the Centrist Party are regarded as the
three main competitors.
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic development, right-wing Knesset member Benny
Begin, head of the United National Party, was qualified as prime
minister candidate Tuesday night only with a last-minute help
from Israel B'aliya, an immigration party.
</P>
<P>
After some 11,000 of the 58,000 signatures supporting Begin's
candidacy were suspected of being forged, Natan Sharansky, leader
of the Israel B'aliya, announced that he and four Knesset members
from his party would back Begin's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Together with Knesset members from his own list, Begin was
secured the recommendation of 10 serving Knesset members, which
constitutes an alternative to at least 50,000 signatures of
voters required for a prime ministerial candidate.
</P>
<P>
Former Knesset member Yosef Ba-Gad, who claimed that his list
of 50,000 supporters caught on fire and burned, was approved by
the election committee as prime ministerial candidate.
</P>
<P>
Arab Knesset member Azmi Bishara, leader of the Balad, or
National Democratic Assembly, joined the premiership race last
week, becoming the first Arab Israeli to run for the top
executive office in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Tibi resigned Tuesday as advisor to Palestinian National
Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat to join in the Knesset election
as No. 2 on Bishara's list.
</P>
<P>
The previous record number of parties competing in elections
was 27, recorded in the 12th Knesset elections in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Twenty parties ran in the last Knesset elections in 1996, with
11 of them winning at least one seat in the 120-member
legislative body.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Expects Better Economic Performance in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's economy is
expected to stage a recovery in 1999 after a big contraction in
1998.
</P>
<P>
The country's real gross domestic product (GDP) is projected to
record a positive growth of 1 percent in 1999 against a
contraction of 6.7 percent in 1998, according to the forecast by
Bank Negara (State Bank) in its 1998 annual report released here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"There is a possibility that GDP growth could be higher than
projected in 1999 should the prospects for the international
environment improve or the private sector respond more favorably
to the policy measures," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Since the fourth quarter of 1998, the outlook for the Malaysian
economy has turned positive with indicators showing signs of a
revival in consumer and investor sentiment, it said.
</P>
<P>
Given that prospects of export growth, which has shown a
recovery since October 1998, remain uncertain, the main source of
growth for the Malaysian economy will emanate mainly from domestic
demand supported by the fiscal stimulus.
</P>
<P>
Economic recovery in 1999 is expected to be gradual in view of
the high inventory build-up in the first half of 1998 and the
increase in capacity in many industries resulting from several
years of expansion, it said.
</P>
<P>
Growth is likely to be marginal in the first half of 1999,
allowing the economy to consolidate, it said adding restructuring
of the financial and corporate sectors will intensify in the
second and third quarters of 1999 to create more favorable
conditions for stronger growth in the second half-year.
</P>
<P>
Positive growth in output in the manufacturing, services and
agriculture sectors is expected while the decline in the
construction sector is forecast to moderate and the mining sector
to contract.
</P>
<P>
In the manufacturing sector, output is projected to turn around
to register an increase of 0.8 percent in 1999 compared with a
10.2 percent decline in 1998, with main impetus from the stronger
expansion in output of the domestic-oriented industries.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the agriculture sector is also expected to turn
around to increase by 5 percent from a decline of 4 percent in
1998 due mainly to forecast higher output of crude palm oil.
</P>
<P>
The construction sector, which experienced a most severe
decline in output last year, is forecast to experience a further
consolidation of activities in 1999, but its output decline is
projected to moderate to 8 percent against a decline of 24.5
percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In the mining sector, which increased by 0.8 percent in 1998,
is expected to contract in 1999 as crude oil production will
decline by 1.8 percent from the 1998 level despite higher
production of gas and tin in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Activity in the services sector is expected to increase in 1999
in line with the expansion of the leading sectors in the economy
with the sector's growth rate forecast at 2.5 percent compared
with a growth rate of 1.5 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Real aggregate domestic demand, which declined, for the first
time since 1986, by 20.6 percent in current prices in 1998, is
expected to turn around to record an increase of 4.3 percent in
1999.
</P>
<P>
The current account of the balance of payments, which recorded
an unprecedented large surplus of 36.1 billion ringgit (about 9.2
billion U.S. dollars), is expected to decline moderately to 29.5
billion ringgit (about 7.76 billion U.S. dollars) or 11 percent of
gross national product.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's total external debt outstanding, which declined by
6.4 percent to 159.8 billion ringgit (about 42 billion U.S.
dollars) at the end of 1998, is forecast to increase by 4.2
percent to 166.4 billion ringgit (about 43.79 billion U.S.
dollars) in 1999 based on the assumption the short-term debt would
remain unchanged at end-1998 level which was 18 percent of the
total external debt, and the moderate increase in medium- and
long-term debt.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rate is projected to be contained below 4 percent in
1999 against 5.3 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The projected recovery in the economy in 1999 is expected to
generate increased employment opportunities in all the major
sectors of the economy, however in view of the higher entrants
into the domestic labor market, the unemployment rate is estimated
to increase above the full employment level of 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bank Negara described the year 1999 as "another challenging
year" in terms of macroeconomic management.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has already embarked on a fiscal stimulus program as
early as March 1998 to stimulate domestic demand as the main
engine of growth.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said the strategy of domestic-driven growth
would continue in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Military Strike Against Yugoslavia Abominable Precedent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The US-led NATO air strikes
against the sovereign state of Yugoslavia are an "abominable
precedent" in international relations, some analysts said at a
post-cold-war international relations symposium here today.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, sponsored by China's Foreign Affairs College,
was attended by Chinese international relations scholars from
various research institutes. They focused on the impact of the
NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia, which circumvent United
Nations regulations under the pretext of halting "humanitarian
disasters" in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The participants said that these represent hegemony, have
violated the UN Charter and could have seriously negative
consequences for world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Some experts pointed out that the U.S., with its power politics
of recent years and with its economic and military advantages,
could exercise its will for a time, but it will not be effective
in the long run and could add to the problems in international
security.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Share Prices Lower on Last Day of Fiscal 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed slightly lower
in Tokyo with thin trading Wednesday as investors stayed on the
sidelines on the last day of fiscal year 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange dropped 22.53 points, or 0.14
percent, from Tuesday's close to end at 15,836.59. The index
failed to end above 16,527.17 recorded on the last trading day of
the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), which also
beat the fiscal 1997 closing level of 1,251.70, fell 2.02 points
or 0.16 percent to 1,267.22.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section edged up to 480.42 million shares
from 464.40 million shares Tuesday, but traders said trading
volume still remained low, reflecting investors' reluctance to
trade at the end of the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Kankaku Securities was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
All through the day, share prices wandered between plus and
minus territory. The Nikkei once topped 16,000 in the afternoon,
boosted by a rise in index futures prices, before losing upward
momentum partly because of profit-taking, traders said.

<P>
MANILA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A big step towards liberalizing
imports and freer trade in Pakistan was taken Wednesday with the
approval by the Asian Development Bank(ADB) of a 300 million U.S.

PARIS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic refused to yield on
Tuesday by insisting of a stop of NATO strikes as a precondition
for a resumption of talks on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
-- In France, Britain and Germany, the question of whether NATO
intervention has accelerated the repression in Kosovo is dividing
public opinions and the political consensus around the raids
appear more and more fragile. Meanwhile, NATO has repelled the
attacks by the media on accusation that NATO airstrikes have
worsened the plight of the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Le Monde:
</P>
<P>
-- Trapped in the torment of the war in the Balkans, the
Yugoslav republic of Montenegro has to confront pressure from both
the NATO and Belgrade, plus an influx of Albanian refugees. The
government of Montenegro, which has adopted a stand clearly
hostile to Milosevic, appears powerless before a return of pro-
Serbian feeling of its people.
</P>
<P>
-- While former Warsaw Pact countries stand by the side of NATO
to different degrees in the present conflict in Yugoslavia, public
opinions are divided over the NATO operation in the three new NATO
members -- Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland, which are also
not going to join any future international mission in former
Yugoslavia.

in leading British newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Britain reacted coolly Tuesday night to Yugoslav President
Milosevic's attempt to get NATO to call off its airstrikes. Senior

</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- America, Britain and Germany Tuesday night dismissed an
offer by President Milosevic of Yugoslavia to start pulling troops
out of Kosovo and begin peace talks if NATO first ends its air
strikes. They said that the proposal did not go nearly far enough.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- The Spanish judge seeking to extradite Augusto Pinochet to
Spain has said he will co-operate in seeing the former Chilean
leader tried in Britain, should the British Home Secretary decide

<HEADLINE> WTO to Choose New Chief at Last-Minute Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Members of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) will meet here Wednesday to decide who will
lead the organization into the new century.
</P>
<P>
Although March 31 is the last day of the end-March deadline for
the 134-member WTO to choose a new director-general, a consensus
is still yet to be reached.
</P>
<P>
However, the switch of support of the European Union for
Thailand's Supachai Panitchpakdi could boost the Thai in his bid
for the WTO chief.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member EU was originally divided with eight for 52-year-
old Supachai and seven for his opponent, 50-year-old Michael Moore
of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
"Germany, as the president of EU, lobbied hard for consensus
among the group, with German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer
throwing his weight behind Supachai," said Thai Foreign Minister
Surin Pitsuwan.
</P>
<P>
"This is a major breakthrough," he said. "It means EU has a
clear position that they don't want division and want a candidate
from a developing country to head WTO."
</P>
<P>
Supachai has been in the lead since WTO began to choose its new
director-general in the fourth quarter of 1998 but Moore is
believed to have the support from the United States and majority
support from Latin America and much of the sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
Originally, there were four candidates to run for the WTO
position, but Hassan Abuyoub of Morocco quit and Roy MacLaren of
Canada suspended the contest after failing to gather sufficient
backing.
</P>
<P>
The WTO members have missed several deadlines before to agree
on their new leader.

<HEADLINE> Record Number of Parties to Run for Next Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A record number of 33 parties
will run for the next Knesset (Parliament) in the May elections
in Israel, raising the possibility that the 15th Knesset will be
further fragmented.
</P>
<P>
All these parties had presented their Knesset lists to the
Central Election Committee by Tuesday midnight, the deadline for
registration of parties and prime minister candidates.
</P>
<P>
There are six candidates for the premiership. Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu of Likud, Ehud Barak of the opposition Labor
Party and Yitzhak Mordechai of the Centrist Party are regarded as
the three main competitors.
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic development, right-wing Knesset member Benny
Begin, head of the United National Party, was qualified as prime
minister candidate Tuesday night only with a last-minute help
from Israel B'aliya, an immigration party.
</P>
<P>
After some 11,000 of the 58,000 signatures supporting Begin's
candidacy were suspected of being forged, Natan Sharansky, leader
of the Israel B'aliya, announced that he and four Knesset members
from his party would back Begin's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Together with Knesset members from his own list, Begin was
secured the recommendation of 10 serving Knesset members, which
constitutes an alternative to at least 50,000 signatures of
voters required for a prime ministerial candidate.
</P>
<P>
Former Knesset member Yosef Ba-Gad, who claimed that his list
of 50,000 supporters caught on fire and burned, was approved by
the election committee as prime ministerial candidate.
</P>
<P>
Arab Knesset member Azmi Bishara, leader of the Balad, or
National Democratic Assembly, joined the premiership race last
week, becoming the first Arab Israeli to run for the top
executive office in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Tibi resigned Tuesday as advisor to Palestinian National
Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat to join in the Knesset election
as No. 2 on Bishara's list.
</P>
<P>
The previous record number of parties competing in elections
was 27, recorded in the 12th Knesset elections in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Twenty parties ran in the last Knesset elections in 1996, with
11 of them winning at least one seat in the 120-member
legislative body.

<HEADLINE> China to Accelerate Inland Waterways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- China is to speed up the
construction of its inland waterways, in a bid to meet the demands
of its growing national economy, according to Li Juchang, Deputy
Minister of Communications.
</P>
<P>
Li said today that in the next few years, the country will
concentrate on building waterways with a total length of 15,000
kilometers to complement its 20 major rivers, such as the Yangtze
River, Pearl River and the Beijing-Hangzhou Canal.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, construction of ports, docks and related security
system will also be under way," said Li.
</P>
<P>
China's inland waterways now stretch 110,000 kilometers, 7,000
km of which are capable of carrying vessels of over 1,000 tons.
There are also currently 520 berths along these waterways, 50 of
which are designed for over 10,000-ton vessels.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that inland navigation plays an important role
in the country's economic growth and social development.
</P>
<P>
However, China's investment in the sector has been too limited
in the past 50 years, hence the decision promote it, he said.

<HEADLINE> Timber Prices Drop Despite Logging Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua)-- Timber prices have been falling
since the beginning of the year, despite a ban on logging in the
country's forests areas, according to a recent issue of the China
Materials News.
</P>
<P>
The logging ban, announced soon after the severe floods last
year, resulted in a temporary rise in timber prices but this was
not maintained this year, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
A low demand for timber has caused the drop in prices and in
Jiangsu Province in east China, timber prices even fell to the
level before the logging ban was announced.
</P>
<P>
The report estimated that the timber market should witness a
rebound in the second quarter, when a large of number of
infrastructure construction projects are launched.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has committed 1.2
billion shillings (some 20 million U.S. dollars) to the
development and marketing of Jua Kali (small private businesses)
products, an official with the bank said here in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
World Bank country director Harold Wackman said Tuesday that
his bank had also pledged additional assistance to the sector once
the Kenyan government would provide sites for Jua Kali
operations, the Kenya Times newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Wackman said the government cannot address the issues of
unemployment unless Jua Kali is fully supported. Out of 240,000
jobs created every year, only 26,000 are in the formal sector
while over 200,000 are in the informal sector, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Kenyan government to set aside permanent places
for small businesses, adding that parcels of land had been set
aside for the sector in some cities including Eldoret and Kisumu
in the west and Mombasa in the south.
</P>
<P>
For Kenya to achieve sustained economic growth, the director
said, the government would need to address the scourge of AIDS,
invest more in education and training and reduce population
growth.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has supported Kenya in training managerial and
technical skills and 5,000 Jua Kali workers have been
beneficiaries, he added.

<HEADLINE> China To Boost Global Scientific Links </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- China is keen to take part in the
world's major scientific programs such as the Alpha International
Space Station, according to Wang Shaoqi, head of the International
Cooperation Department of the Ministry of Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
Already the Ministry of Science and Technology has promised
that 2.5 billion yuan (300 million U.S. dollars) will be allocated
over the next five years to help boost the country's own basic
research programs.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shaoqi confirmed with Xinhua today that China is making
strenuous efforts to play its part in major international programs,
especially with the rapid development of its economic and
scientific power.
</P>
<P>
However, so far China has not been involved in any such
programs but is seeking ways of cooperating with scientifically
advanced countries such as Germany, the United States, Britain,
France, Canada, Japan and Russia. It hopes to push forward Sino-
foreign cooperation in these fields to a new higher level.
</P>
<P>
Wang stressed that China wants especially to promote scientific
cooperation with Russia.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that such programs are an important part of
basic scientific research which is closely linked to national
interests, a country's development strategy and its ability to
compete internationally.
</P>
<P>
As usually a huge financial investment and vast numbers of
first-rate scientists are required for most scientific programs
they do require international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lu Yongxiang, president of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS), announced earlier this year that the country's
highest scientific body is to focus its international cooperation
on those particular global scientific research programs and
actively support them.
</P>
<P>
The CAS has already established a number of jointly-run labs
with France, Germany and Britain.

BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Statistics from the Ministry of
Education show that over ten million people participated in
examinations after taking home courses in higher education in 1998,
up 15.98 percent over 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education is in the middle of its annual
working conference, which lasts from March 30 to April 1 in
Beijing, to summarize and direct home education.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 the ministry encouraged those in rural areas to take
study at home and sit examinations. It also invited educational
experts to edit home teaching materials in 566 subjects.
</P>
<P>
Since the home-based higher education program began in 1981,
some 20 million people have taken exams, and 1.8 million obtained
university or college certificates. It has helped solve the
problem of there not being enough places in Chinese universities
for the needs.
</P>
<P>
The program was extended to include Hong Kong residents in 1994
and has attracted 400 participants there annually ever since.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Machinery Steel Demand Expected to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua)-- China's machine-building industry
is expected to need 10.51 million tons of steel this year, up 2.69
percent over last year, according to the State Bureau of Machinery
Industry.
</P>
<P>
Last year, machinery steel consumption stood at about 10.23
million tons, up 4.03 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Machinery steel refers to steel used in engineering machinery,
automobiles, power equipment, home appliances and farming machines,
among others.
</P>
<P>
This year, the industry is expected to benefit from a few
favorable policies such as expanded infrastructure spending and an
increase of export-related value added tax rebate from nine
percent to 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bureau predicts that demands for silicon steel, seamless
tubes, heavy sections, wire rod, medium plate and thin gauge sheet
will increase significantly. Those for heavy rail, light rail and
welded pipes will remain unchanged, with the rest of the products
set for further decline.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The old city wall in Kaifeng in
central China's Henan, the former capital, is being rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
The 14.4-km. wall was first built in the year 781 during the
Tang Dynasty (618-907) and was later fortified during the Jin (
1115-1234), Yuan (1271-1368), Ming (1368-1644), and Qing (1644-
1911) dynasties. It was put on the state protection list in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Because it was disregarded for so long it is run down in many
places. To restore it to its past splendor, a special group has
been set up by the city government to oversee the work and it has
raised 2 million yuan, while a million yuan has been allocated by
the State Cultural Relics Administration. Workers have already
rebuilt the tower at the West Gate and a section of the wall
inside Tieta Park.
</P>
<P>
They expect to take seven or eight years to complete the work.
</P>
<P>
Kaifeng was the capital during seven dynasties and had to be
rebuilt several times because of Yellow River floods.

<HEADLINE> New Laundry Detergent Additive From Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Kaiyuan Chemical Group Co.
Ltd of northwest China's Gansu Province has developed a laundry
detergent additive made from sodium silicate.
</P>
<P>
The product is licensed to companies in Germany, the United
States, and some other countries. It is expected to help solve the
pollution problem in rivers and lakes caused by phosphorus in
detergent.
</P>
<P>
China now produces two million tons of detergent each year,
using sodium tripolyphosphate as the main ingredient. It means
that several hundred thousand tons of phosphorus is released into
surface water each year, causing the growth of plankton in rivers
and lakes and serious water pollution.
</P>
<P>
Scientific studies have shown that one gram of phosphorus in
water can produce 100 grams of blue green alga, which can directly
cause cancerous toxins and developed countries have banned the use
of detergents with phosphorus additives.
</P>
<P>
In early 1998, the Chinese government also issued rules
prohibiting the sale of detergent with phosphorus, but the sodium
silicate used for non-phosphorus detergent is imported from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predict annual demand for the new product to reach 500,
000 tons in China.

<HEADLINE> Urgent: Malaysia's Economy Contracts 6.7 Percent in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's economy
contracted by
6.7 percent in 1998 when the full effect of the regional financial
crisis
was felt, according to the 1998 annual report released by the Bank
Negara
(State Bank) Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This was the first annual contraction of the country's real
gross
domestic product (GDP) after 12 years of uninterrupted expansion
averaging 7.8 percent per annum. Even in 1997 when the regional
financial
crisis erupted, real GDP grew by 7.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Malaysia's macroeconomic policy management focused on
reducing risks in the economy to ensure macroeconomic stability
and
promote a stronger financial system.
</P>
<P>
The annual report said that overall, there are indications that
the
trough in the growth cycle had been reached in the third quarter
of 1998
and Malaysia ended the year on a positive note, with the
underlying
economic conditions generally favorable.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is expected to stage a recovery in 1999 with real GDP
recording a positive growth of 1 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's economy is
expected to
stage a recovery in 1999 after a big contraction in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The country's real gross domestic product (GDP) is projected to
record
a positive growth of 1 percent in 1999 against a contraction of
6.7
percent in 1998, according to the forecast by Bank Negara (State
Bank) in
its 1998 annual report released here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The projected recovery in the economy in 1999 is expected to
generate
increased employment opportunities in all the major sectors of the

economy, however in view of the higher entrants into the domestic
labor
market, the unemployment rate is estimated to increase above the
full
employment level of 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bank Negara described the year 1999 as "another challenging
year" in
terms of macroeconomic management.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has already embarked on a fiscal stimulus program as
early as
March 1998 to stimulate domestic demand as the main engine of
growth.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said the strategy of domestic-driven growth
would
continue in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Economy Contracts 6.7 Percent in 1998: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's economy
contracted by 6.7 percent in 1998 when the full effect of the
regional financial crisis was felt, according to the 1998 annual
report released by the Bank Negara (State Bank) Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This was the first annual contraction of the country's real
gross domestic product (GDP) after 12 years of uninterrupted
expansion averaging 7.8 percent per annum. Even in 1997 when the
regional financial crisis erupted, real GDP grew by 7.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Per capita income in nominal terms declined to 11,835 ringgit
(about 3,018 U.S. dollars) in 1998 from 12,051 ringgit (about
4,284 U.S. dollars) in 1997, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, activities in all sectors were affected with the
exception of the mining sector.
</P>
<P>
Output of the manufacturing sector contracted by 10.2 percent
in 1998, the first decline since 1985, with output of the
domestic-oriented industries falling sharply by 13.4 percent owing
to the severe contraction in domestic demand, and that of
export-oriented industries by 7.3 percent reflecting the economic
downturn in the Asia-Pacific region which accounted for 40 percent
of Malaysia's manufactured exports.
</P>
<P>
The construction sector in the year under review experienced a
most severe contraction in output by 24.5 percent against a growth
of 9.5 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The sharp contraction in this sector was attributed to
completion of large projects, deferment of selected new
infrastructure projects and slow implementation of existing
infrastructure projects as well as postponement of non-residential
projects.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture sector contracted by 4 percent in 1998,
reflecting declines in the production of all major commodities
such as crude palm oil and rubber affected mainly by adverse
weather, labor shortage, unfavorable prices, reduced cultivated
area and lower yields.
</P>
<P>
However, value added in the mining sector increased further by
0.8 percent in 1998 against 1 percent growth in 1997, reflecting
primarily higher production of crude oil and gas increasing by 1.7
percent and 0.3 percent respectively, and a turnaround in tin
production which grew by 10.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Following the contraction in the economy, the growth in the
service sector moderated in 1998, which recorded a growth rate of
1.5 percent compared with 8 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
On the demand side, aggregate domestic demand declined, for the
first time since 1986, by 20.6 percent in current prices in 1998
against a growth of 9.6 percent in 1997 and an average annual
growth rate of about 13.5 in the period 1987-97.
</P>
<P>
Total consumption spending declined by 6.5 percent in nominal
terms in 1998 following an increase of 8 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The contraction in total investment was significantly higher at
39 percent in nominal terms and 44.9 percent in real terms with
private investment declining by 53.3 percent in nominal terms.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, gross national savings continued to increase by 5.1
percent in 1998 despite the contraction in the domestic economy,
thus bringing its share in gross national product (GNP) to 41.2
percent against 39.4 percent recorded in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The balance of payments outturn in 1998 was much better than
expected with the current account recording an unprecedented large
surplus of 36.1 billion ringgit (about 9.2 billion U.S. dollars),
far exceeding the 20.1 billion ringgit (about 5.29 billion U.S.
dollars) surplus projected in the 1999 budget announcement in
October 1998.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's overall external debt situation improved in 1998.
The country's total external debt outstanding declined by 6.4
percent to 159.8 billion ringgit (about 42 billion U.S. dollars)
at the end of 1998 and short-term debt accounted for only 18
percent of the total external debt against 25 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the gross international reserves held by the central
bank rose significantly by about 68 percent to 99.438 billion
ringgit (about 26.2 billion U.S. dollars) at the end of 1998, a
level sufficient to finance 5.7 months of retained imports.
</P>
<P>
In the year under review, the inflation rate increased by 5.3
percent, but lower than the earlier estimates of 7 - 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the employment front, in the face of a contraction in
domestic economic activity, the unemployment rate is estimated to
have increased from 2.5 percent in 1997 to 3.9 percent in 1998,
below the full employment level of 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Malaysia's macroeconomic policy management focused on
reducing risks in the economy to ensure macroeconomic stability
and promote a stronger financial system.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of the Macao SAR Basic Law (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Basic Law of the Macao
Special Administrative Region (SAR), a document promulgated six
years ago today, represents an accurate and complete embodiment of
the great concept of "one country, two systems".
</P>
<P>
The fundamental importance of the legal code is to maintain the
prosperity and stability of Macao following the region's return to
the Motherland on December 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua News Agency will publish a question and answer series on
the ABCs of the Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative
Region beginning today.
</P>
<P>
The ABCs of the Basic Law of the Macao SAR (1):
</P>
<P>
(1) How did the Macao Question arise?
</P>
<P>
Macao has been an integral part of Chinese territory since
ancient times. The Macao issue arose as a result of the corruption
and incompetence of feudal dynasties in China and aggression
against China committed by imperialist powers.
</P>
<P>
Portugal acquired the right to pay ship calls at the Macao Port
and conduct trade there in 1535. The Portuguese established a
permanent base in Macao in 1553 under the pretext of the need for
a facility to dry goods damaged by water.
</P>
<P>
A walled village was established in 1557 and Portuguese traders
paid rental fees to local Chinese officials in exchange for the
right of residence in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The Opium War erupted in 1840 and ended with victorious Western
imperialist powers forcing the government of the Qing Dynasty to
cede the territory and pay indemnities.
</P>
<P>
Portugal passed a law in 1845 declaring Macao as a "free port."
The Portuguese government refused to pay land-use fees, forcibly
gained control of local customs offices and expelled Chinese
officials and soldiers from Macao.
</P>
<P>
Portugal resorted to the use of force between 1851-1864 to gain
jurisdiction over Taipa and Coloane islands and thus completing
its occupation of Macao.
</P>
<P>
The Qing government in Beijing signed the unequal Sino-
Portuguese Treaty of Reconciliation and Trade in 1887 consenting
to Portugal's "permanent administration of Macao". However,
extensive negotiations failed to yield an agreement on the
demarcation of boundaries.
</P>
<P>
The fourth extension of the Sino-Portuguese Treaty of
Reconciliation and Trade expired in 1928 and China's Nationalist
government notified the Portugal of its intent to terminate the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
The new Sino-Portuguese Treaty of Friendship and Trade
concluded thereafter failed to address the Macao question and
Portugal's occupation of Macao continued.
</P>
<P>
Portugal passed an organic law in 1955 declaring Macao as one
of its overseas colony. The new Portuguese government which
assumed power after a successful anti-fascist coup in 1974 granted
independence to all overseas colonies and recognized Macao as a
part of China's territory.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Organic Law adopted in 1976 stipulated that the
territory, a special area under Portuguese rule, enjoyed
administrative, economic, financial and legislative autonomy.
</P>
<P>
China and Portugal established formal diplomatic relations in
1979, with the two nation countries reached the following
agreement: Macao is a part of China's territory which is now under
Portuguese administration. The Macao question is left over from
history. It will be settled by China and Portugal at an
appropriate time through friendly consultations.

<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Today's edition of China
Securities Daily reported that a panel has been formed yesterday

</P>
<P>
This panel consists of leading, advisory and working groups,

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Service Sector Boosts Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's service industry,
including the postal, telecommunications, financial and trade
sectors, accounted for a record 50.1 percent of local GDP in the
first two months of the year.
</P>
<P>
The service sector moved in front of the local industrial
sector in terms contributions to the local economy for the first
time in history. The latter sector accounted for 48.5 percent of
local GDP during the period, down dramatically from the 77.4
percent for 1978.
</P>
<P>
The change indicates that Shanghai has shifted from an assembly
and distribution center for raw materials and manufactured goods
to a comprehensive capital and information hub.
</P>
<P>
It also indicates the city has moved forward in efforts to
become an international economic, financial and trade center.
</P>
<P>
The service sector's contribution to local GDP has grown by an
annual average of 1.4 percentage points since 1978, with the
figure for 1998 hitting 47.8 percent. On the other hand, the
industrial sector's proportional contributions to GDP have edged
down 1.3 percentage points annually and ended last year at 50.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai introduced an industrial restructuring program in the
early-1980s and has since adopted definitive guidelines placing
priority on developing the service sector.
</P>
<P>
The service sector is expected to keep pace with industrial
sector in the process of local economic development.

<HEADLINE> Gulf States Advised to Stress Private Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Governments of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) countries should act to encourage more
active private sector role in economic development, a study
recommanded.
</P>
<P>
The study, published in the Trade and Industry magazine of the
Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said GCC governments
should curb their involvement in commercial activities, thus
providing an ideal environment for private sector activity.
</P>
<P>
The GCC comprises Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain
and the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
"While official plans already call for privatization and an
increased role for the private sector, the process has yet to gain
momentum and embrace all economic sectors," the study said.
</P>
<P>
It said the operations of large state ministries for
electricity and water are redundant and inefficient, and should
be transferred to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
"Privatization can help GCC countries achieve diversification,
both with their domestic production base and with their
investment abroad," it added.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, the prominent role of the public
sector in the GCC countries has led to a high level of government
expenditure which averages 40 percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Government involvement in economic activities also effectively
excluded the private sector from major development projects.
</P>
<P>
"What is needed is to encourage more active private sector
participation in technologically advanced activities which will
also enable them to compete in the global economy," it noted.

<HEADLINE> Fixed Asset Investments Increasing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- China continued to maintain the
momentum for fixed asset investments during the first two months
of the year.
</P>
<P>
A recent report released by the State Development Planning
Commission indicated that total fixed asset investments hit 84.5
billion yuan during that period, excluding funds contributed by
collective and private investors, up 28.3 percent on an annual
basis.
</P>
<P>
Priority investment areas included capital construction,
technological upgrades and real estate, with respective
investments in the sector growing 32.1, 22.4 and 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the rise to the lingering impact of
policies the central government adopted in the latter half of 1998
to consolidate infrastructure. The government allocated
approximately 74.8 billion yuan of the projected 100 billion yuan
in treasury bonds earmarked for the effort during the January-
February period alone.
</P>
<P>
Increased investments in fixed assets have sparked industrial
production, the added value for the period rising 10.6 percent to
28 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Investment in east China stood at 25.3 percent, compared to 30.
8 percent in the central areas and 35.9 percent in western regions.
</P>
<P>
Projections calls for 12 percent growth in fixed asset
investments during 1999.

<HEADLINE> Melbourne Could Face Challenges for 2006 Commenwealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Melbourne could face more
challenges for its bid to host the 2006 Commonwealth Games with
Cape Town and New Delhi's possible attendance.
</P>
<P>
Wellington, Melbourne's only rival to host the Games, quitted
from the race last month due to financial problems and left no any
other challengers to the Australian city.
</P>
<P>
However, Melbourne bid chief Ron Walker said there were sources
that South Africa and India could be set to mount late bids upon
the deadline of April 9.
</P>
<P>
"There is some information coming out of Cape Town and Delhi
that they may just enter the race at the last minute," Walker was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"There are some people in Cape Town and Delhi who have been
making some inquiries."
</P>
<P>
Melbourne has been lobbying for three years to host the Games
and has always been a front-runner with most of the facilities
already in place. It has repeatedly shown that it can handle world-
class events.
</P>
<P>
Walker believed Melbourne will draw bigger crowds to the
Commonwealth Games than the Sydney 2000 Olympics if it is named
host city.
</P>
<P>
Walker, who has lobbied every country in the Commonwealth, will
make Melbourne's presentation in London.
</P>
<P>
A decision on who will host the Games will be decided in Fiji
on October 10.

The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States Tuesday tried to correct what it called a
misconception on Israel's part, saying clearly it expects Israel
to fulfill its obligations under the Wye accord, including the
troop pullbacks in the West Bank, without waiting for the
Palestinians to fulfill their part of the agreement first. The
comments came two days after U.S. officials presented conflicting
versions of American expectations of Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu supports NATO actions in
Kosovo, government officials said Tuesday, after Foreign Minister
Ariel Sharon pointedly refused on Monday to back the NATO action
against the Serbs. Netanyahu's support was coupled with an
explicit statement against Serbian mass killing in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- A record number of 33 parties and six candidates for prime
minister are running in the upcoming elections. All parties had

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 31 (Xinhua)- Vietnam is trying to reduce this
year's trade deficit to 15 percent of the total export value, down
7.8 percent on the 1998 figure.
</P>
<P>
This was announced at a business conference held by Vietnam's
Ministry of Trade in Hanoi on March 28-29, according to a report
of Vietnam News Agency Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A report at the conference said that this year the trade sector
is trying to register 195,000 billion Vietnamese dong (roughly 14
billion U.S. dollars) in retail sales, up 8 percent over last
year.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's trade sector is also trying to post an export
turnover of 10 billion U.S. dollars, of which domestic enterprises
will contribute 7.6 billion U.S. dollars, or up three percent, and
the foreign-invested sector, 2.4 billion U.S. dollars, up more
than 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
The trade sector, on the other hand, is expected to import a

<HEADLINE> UK Import Ban on Chinese Goldfish Lifted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 31 (Xinhua) -- British quarantine officials
have given the green light to partially reinstate import licenses
for Chinese goldfish which have been under an eight-month-long
suspension due to alleged viral infections in the fish, which are
used mostly in display tanks.
</P>
<P>
But the ban is still in force on any exports from Beijing and
Tianjin awaiting further test results which might take up to a
year.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday morning, the Hung Hoi Aquarium Co. Ltd. in south
China's Guangdong Province loaded a shipment of 10,000 goldfish
bound for Britain, the first since the ban was rescinded.
</P>
<P>
The company specializes in breeding a variety of exotic fish
and annually exports some six to seven million to North America
and Europe.
</P>
<P>
However, their business with Britain was suspended nearly a
year ago after the Center for Environmental, Fish and Agricultural
Sciences (CEFAS) in the UK, claimed to have found the SVC viral
infection in goldfish imported from Beijing. It asked its Chinese
counterparts to instigate a two year monitoring program and impose
a nation-wide quarantine on such fish, which led to the temporary
import ban.
</P>
<P>
Soon after, France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Japan and Singapore
followed Britain's decision and imposed a similar ban on the
goldfish, which resulted in losses to Chinese exporters of more
than 100 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chinese quarantine centers in Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen
quickly responded by carrying out a thorough epizootic examination
and research into the infection as laid down by the International
Epizootic Organization (IEO). They discovered that, in fact, the
infection was not present in most Chinese goldfish breeding
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In December last year, Barry Hill, the CEFAS's leading advisor
who is also an official with the IEO, came on an inspection tour
of China during which he too became convinced that not all Chinese
fish farms were infected.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the CEFAS lifted its import restrictions on
February 19 allowing goldfish exports from China but not from
Beijing and Tianjin, insisting that the two year interdiction term
remain in force for these two cities so that further observations
can be made.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Levy Commercial Tax in Foreign Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar will levy a commercial tax
on foreign currency with effect from January 1 this year,
according to a six-part 25-section 1999 State Budget Law
promulgated here Tuesday by the State Peace and Development
Council.
</P>
<P>
If foreign currency is included in the proceeds of sale or
total proceeds of sale received by any person from any production
and sale of goods or from any trading work of purchase and sale of
goods, a commercial tax equivalent to 8 percent of the amount of
foreign currency shall be paid, Wednesday's official newspaper The
New Light of Myanmar quoted the law as saying.
</P>
<P>
The provision shall not be applicable to items exported by
enterprises with the permission of the Myanmar Investment
Commission, export items re-exported by enterprises carried out by
the cutting, making and packing system and proceeds of sale from
export and sale of export items of the mineral, energy and forest
sectors, the law states.
</P>
<P>
With the exception of the sections relating to the commercial
tax, the provisions of other sections of the law shall come into
force on April 1 for the 1999-2000 financial year, the law added.
</P>
<P>
The remaining sections of the law deal with receipts and
expenditures, reserve fund, taking of loans, state economic
organizations, cantonment municipalities and development
committees and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the reserve fund, any expenditure from the fund
shall be made only by the decision of the government, the law
says.
</P>
<P>
Relating to taking of loans, the government may do so by
issuing security bonds guaranteed by the government or debentures
or by other means within the country or from abroad, the law
states. It adds that dealing with loans obtained by issuing
security bonds for covering the deficit in the budget of the
previous financial year, new security bonds may be issued when
payment of the loan becomes due.
</P>
<P>
The state economic organizations and cantonment municipalities
may take loans from abroad for their projects with the approval of
the government which may also grant permission to any government
department to borrow money from abroad for any project, the law
says.
</P>
<P>
During the 1999-2000 financial year commencing April 1, 1999,
and ending on March 31, 2000, the amount of loans actually
received by the execution of loan agreements shall not exceed 70
billion kyats (233 million U.S. dollars according to the market
exchange rate).

<HEADLINE> ADB Program to Assist Sri Lanka Over Next 3 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
has finalized a strategy document to guide its assistance program
in Sri Lanka over the next three years, ADB officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Over the last two weeks the ADB Country Programming Mission has
been in Sri Lanka to prepare the bank's proposed loan and
technical assistance program covering the period between 2000 and
2002.
</P>
<P>
The mission met with senior government representatives and a
cross-section of the country's private sector and community-based
organizations.
</P>
<P>
ADB Resident Representative Tadashi Kondo said the bank mission
has formulated a program of assistance for the three years
consisting of 10 new loans and 17 technical assistance projects,
exceeding 360 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said it will be supplemented by the bank's possible loan and
equity participation in major private sector projects.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the loans will be provided from the highly
concessional Asian Development Fund resources of the bank," Kondo
said.
</P>
<P>
He said priority areas defined by the bank's new Country
Operational Strategy would include human development,
environmental management, infrastructure development, improvement
in public sector efficiency and the expansion of the role of the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
The ADB has been the main financial assistance organization to
Sri Lanka over the years.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan projects received 190 million dollars loans from the
ADB in 1998. The bank also provided partial credit guarantee for a
project in the country.
</P>
<P>
Under the bank's partial credit guarantee scheme, the bank
provides coverage of all commercial and sovereign risks for a
portion of the debt service. The guarantee for Sri Lanka covered
the principal repayments only.

<HEADLINE> Expert Cites Danger of Indoor Air Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Cui Jiusi, an environmental
expert, recently cited health dangers resulting from indoor air
pollution.
</P>
<P>
Urban dwellers spend 80-90 percent of their time indoors in an
environment with an air pollution index which includes
formaldehyde and high levels of airborne particles, according to
Cui, director of the Air Quality Monitoring Laboratory under the
Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine.
</P>
<P>
The laboratory reached the conclusion based on indoor air
quality date collected over the past 12-odd years.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics from Beijing's Chemical Poisonous Substances
Test Center show that more than 400 poisoning accidents reported
annually are the direct result of construction and interior
decorating materials. The statistics also revealed that some 10,
000 people suffer from related accidents on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
Cui said indoor pollution includes carbon monoxide, nitrogen
dioxide and microscopic airborne particles resulting from the use
of coal, gas and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that interior decorating materials,
furniture and household chemicals release formaldehyde and various
other volatile organic compounds.
</P>
<P>
In addition, various construction materials and household
appliances release radon, ammonia and electromagnetic waves,
according to Cui.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that people should enhance their awareness of self-
protection, quit smoking and pay greater attention to ventilation.
The use of poisonous construction and interior decorating
materials should avoided and plants should be place in indoor
areas, said Cui.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Chinese environmental and health experts have
conducted extensive studies on indoor pollution and health in
recent years.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves 4.9 Billion Dollar Payment for Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) approved on Tuesday the disbursement of 4.9 billion U.S.
dollars to Brazil, the second installment of a massive
international rescue deal agreed last year, to support the
Brazilian government's revised economic program.
</P>
<P>
"Brazil may now borrow a further 4.9 billion dollars, which
would bring its total borrowings from the IMF under the program to
9.6 billion dollars," said Stanley Fischer, Acting Managing
Director of the IMF.
</P>
<P>
He said the Brazilian authorities also are expected to draw 4.9
billion dollars under a facility arranged by the Bank for
International Settlements and a loan from the government of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The IMF payment was initially scheduled for end-February, but
it was delayed after Brazil, bowing to market pressure, devalued
its currency, the real, which forced the IMF and the government to
renegotiate the terms of their agreement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the IMF and the Brazilian government
reached agreement on a new economic plan designed to put the
control of inflation at the center of the country's monetary
policies.
</P>
<P>
Fisher commended the Brazilian authorities for the recent
strengthening of policies, and welcomed both the commitment of the
commercial banks to maintain their exposures to Brazil and the
improvement of market sentiment. He emphasized that the firm
implementation of the economic program remains the key to its
success.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's real gross domestic product is expected to decline by
3.5-4 percent this year. The IMF said the new program will lay
basis for a sustained economic recovery in 2000 and beyond, as
confidence recovers, and external financing constraints are eased.
</P>
<P>
The IMF is the largest single contributor to Brazil's 41-
billion-dollar international rescue deal, which includes money
from the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and from
rich donor states.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand Launches Stimulus Package to Cure Economic Woes (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 31 (Xinhua) -- An ambitious stimulus package
went through the Thai cabinet on Tuesday, representing the
government's latest effort to jump-start the economy, which was
once the vigorous tiger in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The 130 billion baht (3.5 billion U.S. dollars) package,
including expenditure measures, a broad range of tax cuts and
measures to lower energy prices, would provide breathing space for
the economy as it fights its way to achieve a 1-percent growth
this year.
</P>
<P>
"The expenditure measures place a priority on creating jobs,
increasing incomes and alleviating the social impact for those
severely affected by the ongoing economic turmoil in both rural
and urban areas," Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda said in a
statement issued after the Tuesday cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
As many as 486,000 jobs will be saved with Tuesday's package,
which includes a 53 billion baht (1.45 billion dollar) state
spending spree nationwide with loans from the World Bank, Japan's
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund and the Japanese Export-Import
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The tax cuts contained in the package would cover a value-added
tax (VAT) reduction from 10 percent to the pre-crisis level of 7
percent for two years.
</P>
<P>
Small businesses having sales figures of between 600,000 and
1.2 million baht (16,216 and 32,432 dollars) will be given a
1.5-percent cut in VAT.
</P>
<P>
Personal income taxes are cut in an across-the-board fashion by
2 percent while earners of less than 50,000 baht (1,351 dollars)
in net income per year will be granted tax exemption.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin said the tax measures place a priority on stimulating
private investment and consumption, the largest component of gross
domestic product (GDP), by improving purchasing power through
increasing disposable income and reducing the price of consumer
goods.
</P>
<P>
The third part of the package, reducing the energy prices, are
aimed at lowering the cost of living and manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
Under the package, excise tax on fuel oil will be slashed from
17.5 percent to 5 percent, prices for liquefied petroleum gas
reduced by 1 baht (2.7 cents) per kilogram and power charge cut by
0.25 baht (0.67 cents) per unit.
</P>
<P>
The package was warmly received by the private sector and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), which actually helped in
drafting the package.
</P>
<P>
The IMF expressed the hope that the package would stimulate the
economy and halt the deflationary spiral and also said it would
help boost the purchasing power as well as the productivity of
businesses with viable projects which commercial banks are willing
to back.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin expects the construction and consumer-product sectors to
experience the benefits of the stimulus package. Thailand's
automobile sales this year would be driven up by 25 percent over
last year's 180,000 units.

<TEXT>
<P>
However, some critics remain skeptical about the effectiveness
of the package.
</P>
<P>
Most economists agree that an effective revival requires tax
rates to be cut sufficiently to prompt new spending and investment
by corporations and consumers alike.
</P>
<P>
But each one-percentage-point cut in VAT means that the state
loses 20 billion baht (540.5 million dollars) in revenue. The tax
cut measures of the package will cost the state coffers 77 billion
baht (2.08 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Some experts are worried about how much "stimulus" a tax cut
would actually bring to the economy as the current fall in demand
was not caused only by higher prices and declining personal
incomes.
</P>
<P>
Uncertain job and economic prospects have led many households
to sharply cutting back their spending and raising savings instead
to improve their security.
</P>
<P>
People may decide to save money gained from tax cuts, thereby
defeating the goal of raising consumer spending, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Other economic analysts argued that the tax cuts are not deep
enough to really spur the economy. They said the VAT should be cut
from 10 to 5 percent as some economists suggested.
</P>
<P>
Now, the government may face a lose-lose situation, where
consumers remain extremely cautious and the government misses a
big chunk of revenue, they said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some local and foreign bankers, while welcoming
the package, considered the corporate debt restructuring as the
key to long-term economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Banthoon Lamsam said sustainable recovery cannot rely solely on
this single economic package, rather there should also be
substantial debt and productivity restructuring.
</P>
<P>
ABN Amro Asia's Bangkok-based Managing Director David Kadarauch
also warned that the mostly foreign funded stimulus package would
play a secondary role in the recovery compared with corporate debt
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
"A fiscal package can never be the centerpiece of an economic
recovery of the type that Thailand needs," he said. "That role
will be centrally played by debt restructuring, foreclosures as
banks use the new bankruptcy measures."
</P>
<P>
The package is the best news Thailand has right now. But
questions remain as whether or not the consumers will want to
spend the this windfall.
</P>
<P>
However, one thing is certain: The Thai government still faces
a bumpy road ahead.

<HEADLINE> ADB Program to Assist Sri Lanka Over Next 3 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
has finalized a strategy document to guide its assistance program
in Sri Lanka over the next three years, ADB officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Over the last two weeks the ADB Country Programming Mission has
been in Sri Lanka to prepare the bank's proposed loan and
technical assistance program covering the period between 2000 and
2002.
</P>
<P>
The mission met with senior government representatives and a
cross-section of the country's private sector and community-based
organizations.
</P>
<P>
ADB Resident Representative Tadashi Kondo said the bank mission
has formulated a program of assistance for the three years
consisting of 10 new loans and 17 technical assistance projects,
exceeding 360 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said it will be supplemented by the bank's possible loan and
equity participation in major private sector projects.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the loans will be provided from the highly
concessional Asian Development Fund resources of the bank," Kondo
said.
</P>
<P>
He said priority areas defined by the bank's new Country
Operational Strategy would include human development,
environmental management, infrastructure development, improvement
in public sector efficiency and the expansion of the role of the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
The ADB has been the main financial assistance organization to
Sri Lanka over the years.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan projects received 190 million dollars loans from the
ADB in 1998. The bank also provided partial credit guarantee for a
project in the country.
</P>
<P>
Under the bank's partial credit guarantee scheme, the bank
provides coverage of all commercial and sovereign risks for a
portion of the debt service. The guarantee for Sri Lanka covered
the principal repayments only.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Confidence Rises Again in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- An abundance of jobs and
record stock market performance pumped up consumer confidence for
a fifth-straight month in March, the Conference Board reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It said that its index of consumer confidence rose a stronger-
than-expected 0.8 points to 133.9 in March from a revised 133.1 in
February.
</P>
<P>
The index dropped sharply in last October but has since been
making a steady recovery. The upward revision by the business-
financed research group made the February number even stronger
than the 132.1 originally reported.
</P>
<P>
Consumer sentiment is an important economic indicator because
consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the U.S. overall
economic activities.
</P>
<P>
Consumers say jobs were more available in March than in
February, and they foresee a growing labor market over the next
six months. Home-buying plans is still another positive factor.
</P>
<P>
The index that measures expectations for the next six months
was also higher, rising 1.3 points to 104.7.
</P>
<P>
Economists, however, were less sanguine than consumers on
certain portions of the economic outlook but saw nothing near-term
signs to derail confidence.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones' struggle to hold 10,000 points after first
closing above there Monday could erode consumer confidence some
time in the future, some economists said.
</P>
<P>
The consumer confidence index, started in 1967, is compiled
from responses to questions sent to 5,000 households nationwide.
The survey polls consumers on matters ranging from job prospects
to buying plans. The index compares results to its base year, 1985,
when it stood at 100.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Launches Second National Sanitation Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has begun its second
annual national sanitation week as a mass movement to push the
country's sanitation work ahead following the achievement made in
the first event.
</P>
<P>
This year's national sanitation week, which began Tuesday and
will last until April 5, covers carrying out sanitary work in
schools and government departments, motivating the local populace
to be involved in the activities and raising the overall
nationwide coverage to 75 percent by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of the national sanitation week include the
reduction of the spread of communicable diseases, educating the
general public in the values of sanitation and assisting the
people in actual implementation of sanitary works, said the
official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, in cooperation with the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF),
 implemented the first national environmental sanitation week in
May last year. The ultimate goal is to achieve total sanitation
coverage by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
During the first such event, nearly 1 million fly-proof
latrines were built, which was highly appreciated by countries in
East Asia and the Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
According to available data, sanitary works coverage has so far
 increased to 60 percent of households in the country, compared
with 45.7 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Recently, representatives from Indonesia and Bhutan came here
to observe the achievements of the first national sanitation week
 activities undertaken in Myanmar, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Sanitation work has been promoted in Myanmar for more than two
decades and success has been attained to a certain extent and
endeavors are being doubled to realize the goal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, maternal and child health care, nutrition and AIDS
prevention and education are also being carried out in the country
with the assistance of the UNICEF.

said in a survey Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Consumers were more optimistic in the first quarter of this

associate director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research
Center.
</P>
<P>
Franco said, consumers' appraisal of current business
conditions continues to "sail at record-high levels, with no signs
that confidence will erode any time soon." They are continuing to
count on steady business growth, low inflation and a strong job
market through the remainder of the century, she said.
</P>
<P>
Consumer confidence index is a very important economic
indicator because consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of
the overall economic activity in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board said the index that measures consumer
opinions about present conditions rose slightly to 177.8 in March
from an adjusted 177.7 in February, reaching a record high in the
history.
</P>
<P>
The Board said the index that measures consumer expectations
for the next six months rose 1.3 points to 104.7 and only 11.8
percent of consumers said job are hard to get, it added.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic: Yugoslavia to Withdraw Some Troops If NATO Stops Airstrikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Having resisted several days of
NATO bombing, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic said Tuesday
that he was ready to withdraw some troops from Kosovo if NATO
halts airstrikes on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic made the statement after a six-hour-long meeting with
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov who came to Belgrade in a
bid to stop NATO military strikes on Yugoslavia, according to the
official Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
Only through political means, Milosevic said, could the Kosovo
issue be solved, noting that the fearless Yugoslav army and people
will never yield to bombing.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Yugoslav government is ready to take
constructive measures to put the Kosovo issue back on the track of
political settlement.
</P>
<P>
NATO must immediately halt its airstrikes on Yugoslavia so as
to create necessary conditions for the resumption of the Kosovo
peace talks and this will be in the interests of all ethnic
nationalities of Kosovo, Milosevic said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he also demanded NATO completely stop its support
for separatists in Kosovo and withdraw its heavy troops deployed
along the borders of Yugoslavia, saying this would help solve the
Kosovo issue in a political way.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic expressed the belief that the position of Yugoslavia
on the Kosovo issue will win support from Russia, China, India and
other peace-loving peoples.
</P>
<P>
A peaceful solution to the Kosovo issue, which could only be
achieved after NATO stops its military action, will be of great
importance to the future of the Balkans, the Yugoslav leader went
on.
</P>
<P>
However, Milosevic said his country is determined to fight to
the end if NATO refuses to halt the war of aggression, saying that
Yugoslavia has the ability to stand this severe test.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, who headed a senior delegation on a visit to Belgrade,
a close ally of Russia in the Balkan region, told Milosevic that
Russia will stand behind the brave Yugoslav people in their just
struggle against NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
Describing NATO military action as a flagrant aggression,
Primakov said the Russian leadership and people strongly demand an
immediate halt of the airstrikes on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that NATO airstrikes in the past few days
have failed to force Yugoslavia to back down on the Kosovo issue.
Instead they have served to strengthen the will of the Yugoslav
army and people to resist aggression.
</P>
<P>
They added that situation might take a favorable turn if NATO
could end its airstrikes on Yugoslavia as a positive response to
Milosevic's offer.

<HEADLINE> Portugal Opposes Sending in Ground Troops to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Portuguese Prime Minister
Antonio Guterres said here Tuesday that ground forces should not
be sent into Kosovo before a peace agreement on the crisis there
is reached.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference held with his Bulgarian
counterpart Ivan Kostov, Guterres praised Bulgaria for its stance
on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria backs NATO's military operation against Yugoslavia on
the Kosovo crisis, which has entered into day seven, but has not
taken part in military actions against the country.
</P>
<P>
Guterres, who started his three-day official visit to Bulgaria
Monday, also supported Bulgaria's efforts to join the European
Union and NATO, saying if accession talks for Central and Eastern
Europe start, it will be unacceptable to exclude Bulgaria from the
process.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed the enlargement would not stop until
Bulgaria and its neighbors join the two organizations.
</P>
<P>
Guterres expressed the hope that the Bulgarian position on
Kosovo will receive a clear answer at the military alliance's
Washington summit in April.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Kostov expressed satisfaction "
with Portugal's support for Bulgaria's desire to join the European
and Atlantic structures."
</P>
<P>
He also told reporters his country is suffering from great
economic losses caused by transportation interruption with
Yugoslavia, via which most of Bulgaria's goods traded with Western
Europe are transported.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian prime minister also expressed the worry that the
situation in Kosovo, a troubled Yugoslav province, would have
negative impacts on Bulgaria's structural reform, economic growth
and inflow of foreign investment.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Stresses Need to Study Macao SAR Basic Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Wang Qiren, director of the
Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch, recently stressed the long-term
need to fully understand and publicize the Basic Law of the Macao
Special Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
Wang's Preface to the "ABCs of the Basic Law of the Macao SAR"
clearly defines and provides a formal legal framework for the "one
country, two systems" principle.
</P>
<P>
He notes that the Basic Law adheres to the principle of
national unification and provides a high degree of autonomy
enabling the people of Macao to comprehensively administer the
region and related government institutions.
</P>
<P>
Wang's recently published book includes eight chapters in a
question and answer format. The book explicitly covers the process
for drafting the Basic Law and the relationship between the
central government and the MSAR, as well as the new special
administrative region's political framework, economy, culture and
foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
Wang said Macao is in the final stages of transition and
preparations are underway to ensure the smooth transfer of power
in accordance with the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China's long-standing national policy is to
ensure adherence to the concept of "one country, two systems" in
Macao. Wang's book also stresses the need for a nationwide
campaign to study and publicize the Basic Law of the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
Editions of the book will be available in both traditional and
simplified Chinese characters, as well as in English, French,
Spanish, Portuguese, German, Japanese, Russian and Arabic.

<P>
HANOI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Jobless insurance is seen as an
urgent task as unemployment rises in Vietnam, the Vietnam News
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment in Vietnam's urban areas increased from 6.01
percent in 1997 to 6.85 percent in 1998, according to the
English-language daily.
</P>
<P>
The capital city of Hanoi reported a 9.09-percent employment

The Vietnamese government is being urged to introduce national
unemployment insurance policies to ensure income for jobless
workers and stabilize the society.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meets with Nigeria's President-Elect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President-Elect
Olesegun Obasanjo on Tuesday held talks with President Bill
Clinton, discussing the transition to democracy in Nigeria after
his win in February's election.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed the transition in Nigeria. The president
reaffirmed the interest of the U.S. in democracy in Africa,"
Obasanjo said after a half-hour meeting at the White House.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo invited Clinton to attend his inauguration ceremony in
May and the White House said a high-level delegation would go. The
State Department declined to say whether Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright would make the trip.
</P>
<P>
The White House said the meeting "highlighted the broad and
increasing cooperation between our two governments".
</P>
<P>
The United States has expressed its interest in Nigeria's
election in February and has improved its relations with Nigeria,
which hit rock bottom during the rule of General Sani Abacha, who
died last June.
</P>
<P>
Washington has already lifted restrictions on visas for
Nigerian officials and certified it as a country cooperating with
the United States on drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
And Nigeria is seeking more U.S. assistance for ECOMOG, the
Nigerian-led peace force which has been fighting rebels in Sierra
Leone and Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The United States contributed 3.9 million U.S. dollars to
ECOMOG logistics in the 1998 financial year and four million
dollars in the first three months of this year. "We're looking at
ways to increase the amount," a U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo, a retired general, was Nigeria's military leader from
1976 until 1979, when he returned power to a civilian government.
The military took over again four years later.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo had been jailed by General Abacha. After Abacha's
death, his successor, General Abdulasalam Abubakar, steered
Nigeria toward civilian rule and Obasanjo was elected on February.

SANTIAGO, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Latin America is passing through

</P>
<P>
Representatives from Latin American countries, international
organizations and academies discussed the impact of the Asian
financial crisis on Latin American economy, politics and
integration as well as the role regional integration organizations
can play in preventing a similar crisis.
</P>
<P>
They urged the populations to participate in activities
designed "to ensure stability and development in the future."
</P>
<P>
They also noted that without the mechanism of dialogue, which
has worked in the region, the impact of the Asian financial
turmoil on Latin America would have been worse.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Rejects Milosevic's Proposal on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Tuesday called "unacceptable" a proposal by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic for the settlement of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Yugoslavia issued a statement on the
meeting between Milosevic and Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov, calling for an end to NATO's bombing.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the leadership of Yugoslavia would
accept Russia's proposal to resume the political process and, as a
logical consequence of the termination of NATO bombing, remove
some military forces presently stationed in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, after telephone consultations with German Chancellor
Gerhardt Schroeder, said in a statement that he and Schroeder
agreed that the proposal was "unacceptable".
</P>
<P>
"There is strong consensus in NATO that we must press forward
with our military action," said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department said the Yugoslav proposal fall "far
short" of the NATO demands for stopping bombing.
</P>
<P>
"We regard this suggestion as falling far short of what is
necessary in order for NATO to stop its air campaign," U.S. State
Department spokesman James Rubin said at a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Rubin referred to conditions laid down by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic during talks in Belgrade Tuesday with Primakov,
who later visited Bonn and reported details of his talks to German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
"Our position is clear. Milosevic must halt the offensive
against the Kosovo Albanians, withdraw his forces and embrace a
settlement based on the Rambouillet framework," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov and Milosevic held six hours of talks before yielding
a statement by Milosevic that he was willing to rein in a harsh
military campaign against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and resume
peace talks if the NATO strikes stop.
</P>
<P>
A statement from Milosevic's office read on state-run
television said: "To open the space for negotiations, (NATO)
aggression against Yugoslavia has to stop immediately."
</P>
<P>
Milosevic also called for the withdrawal of NATO troops from
Macedonia and a halt in NATO support for the Kosovo Liberation
Army, the ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for independence.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to defend our country to the very end. It is not
the first time that Yugoslavia has had to defend itself and its
sovereignty, territorial integrity and national pride," Milosevic
said.

<P>
HONG KONG, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese budding women
swimmer Chen Hua hopes to break the world record and sweep the
distance freestyle gold medals at the World Short Course Swimming
Championships to be held here from April 1-4.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident I can grab three titles, but my top target for
this meet is to shatter the world record," said Chen, who will
compete in the women's 400, 800 meter freestyles and 4X200m relay.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Chen, who had overpowered Costa Rica's world
record holder Claudia Poll in the 400m and 800m freestyles in
several legs of the World Cup short course series, has topped the
world rankings this year.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen's coach Zhun Zhigen made a low-key comment that
Chen was not in her peak form as she competed too much after the
Bangkok Asian Games last December and some legs of the World Cup
short course.
</P>
<P>
"It's a challenge to test her strength against the world top
swimmer Claudia in such a big international event," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yunpeng, former head coach of the Chinese national
swimming team, tipped Chen will win at least two gold medals if
she performs her normal pace.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Grooms 534 Athletes for SEA Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A national training program is
underway for 534 athletes from 20 sports who will represent
Indonesia in the 20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Bandar Seri
Begawan, Brunei, in August, the Jakarta Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
National Sports Council (KONI) outgoing chief in charge of
athletes development Mohamad Hindarto said that 95 coaches have
joined the program.
</P>
<P>
Training sessions conducted by each sport association were
scheduled to take place between February and May.
</P>
<P>
Each association will evaluate athletes based on their physical
endurance and skills during the four-month training period, before
naming the best qualified candidates for the biennial event.
</P>
<P>
"Not all of them will be dispatched to the SEA Games. We will
only select athletes who have the best chance to win medals. We
will provide an exception for younger athletes, who are preparing
for the 2006 Asian Games," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia aims to improve its ranking from 11th in the 1998
Asiad to sixth in eight years, by staging a long-term training
program -- the Golden Garuda project. Indonesia aims to host the
quadrennial Asian Games in the same year.
</P>
<P>
The SEA Games, to be held by Brunei Darussalam for the first
time from August 7 to 12 will offer 235 gold medals in 21 sports.
Indonesia will compete in 20 sports.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, 884 national athletes brought host Indonesia
back to the top with a record haul of 194 golds, 101 silvers and
115 bronzes, or 44 percent of the total number of gold medals on
offer. Indonesia lost to arch rival Thailand in the 1995 SEA Games
in Chiang Mai, Thailand
</P>
<P>
Hindarto said State Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports Agung
Laksono had vowed to financially assist the Indonesian team by
providing 15 billion rupiah (1.7 million U.S. dollars). The money
will be used to finance the training and tryouts program abroad.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Unprepared for Sudirman Cup, World Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- With only six weeks to go to the
Sudirman Cup and the World Championships in Copenhagen, Denmark,
Indonesian shuttlers are not properly prepared for either event,
the Jakarta Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Men's doubles player Rexy Mainaky accused officials of the
Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI) of being careless in
preparing its athletes for the prestigious events.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to blame the officials but I think they don't
give enough attention to us. We used to have food supplements
during our training back in 1997," Rexy said after a training
session at the Indonesian Badminton Center here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Now, with only six weeks before the events, we don't get
anything. Maybe they (officials) think that even with serious
training two years ago we still lost, so now they don't want to
spend as much money or time training us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's badminton team lost to China in the Sudirman Cup
semifinals in Glasgow two years ago.
</P>
<P>
In the World Championships two years ago, Candra and Sigit
saved face for Indonesia by winning the men's doubles title
against Malaysians Cheah Soon Kit and Yap Kim Hock.
</P>
<P>
Rexy said the PBSI was not providing athletes proper nutrition,
quality shuttlecocks or psychological consultations during the
training for this year's events.
</P>
<P>
"They are asking us to win both events without any support.
They just talk a lot," said the 1996 Olympic gold medalist, adding
that he preferred to compete only in the World Championships.
</P>

Indonesia has a very slight chance of claiming the Sudirman Cup,
which has been won by China since 1995.

<P>
"We only hope to win points in the men's doubles, men's singles
and mixed doubles," Rexy said.
</P>
<P>
Women's singles coach Liang Ciusia also complained that
Indonesia's number one female shuttler Mia Audina had not yet
arrived at the training center after the All England Championships
from March 10 to March 14 in Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
"I want her to come here right now because we have very little
time to prepare. After the All England, Mia asked my permission to
marry Tylio Lobman in the Netherlands. I just told her to keep on
practicing during her time away," said Liang Chiusia, declining to
give the date of the wedding.
</P>
<P>
Liang said she would not count only on Mia in the upcoming
events.
</P>
<P>
"I am also training other shuttlers. Just because Mia is not
here doesn't mean it's the end of the world. We must go on. With
Mia on the team, we might have a slim chance of beating Denmark,
South Korea or China because their women's singles are very strong,
" she added.

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Finance Xinjiang Anti-AIDS Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region will use World Bank funds to implement a program
designed to prevent the spread of the acquired immune deficiency
syndrome (AIDS) and venereal diseases in June.
</P>
<P>
The program will be carried out with World Bank funding of 4.55
million US dollars and regional government allocations of three
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The funds will be used to monitor and control AIDS in Urumqi,
the regional capital, as well as the Ili and Bayangol Mongolian
autonomous prefectures, and 15 counties and cities.
</P>
<P>
Information released during a recent AIDS prevention and
control conference showed 2,300 reported cases of Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in the region, including 20 fully
developed AIDS cases. The disease has killed six Xinjiang
residents.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,087 cases of HIV diagnosed in Xinjiang during 1998
accounted for 37.4 percent of the total number of cases nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The results of a recent survey showed that drug abuse
contributed to 98 percent of HIV cases in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
The region established an agency to prevent and control AIDS
and venereal disease in 1997, with 1998 allocations for related
efforts standing at 1.3 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Five state-level AIDS monitoring stations have been established
in Urumqi, Yining, Hami and Hotian to supervise and monitor the
drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
The region has also established a laboratory to test and
diagnose AIDS, and 11 epidemic prevention stations on the
prefectural level have been equipped with instruments to monitor
the disease.
</P>
<P>
The total number of reported HIV/AIDS cases in China surpassed
10,000 by the end of June last year.
</P>
<P>
China plans to introduce timely and effective preventative
measures to control the HIV infection level at a under 1.5 million
cases by the year 2010.

BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- China's power industry is
currently undertaking large-scale technological renovations
designed to control pollution, increase financial returns and
guarantee safe operations.
</P>
<P>
The sector is in the process of renovating 7.5-8 million
kilowatt low and medium pressure condenser tube generating units
which have been in operation for at least 25 years, according to a
senior official with the China State Power Corporation.

demand periods for power, improve security, reduce energy
consumption and protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
An official from the corporation said that the nation's power
plants will reduce the amount of coal required to produce one
kilowatt hour of electricity by an average 34 grams over the next
few years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the voltage level in more than 95 percent of major
Chinese cities will meet national standards and the reliability
rate for the power supply will hit 99.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that power grids will coordinate power
supplies in order to ensure that the country's five major regional
and 15 provincial power companies reach international standards in
terms of controlling and transferring power.

<HEADLINE> Australia Probes Into U.S. Breach of Space Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Bureau of Air Safety
Investigation (BASI) has begun an inquiry into an incident in
which U.S. military aircraft breached air space regulations at the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
BASI Deputy Director Alan Stray told Australian Broadcasting
Corporation Radio Wednesday that domestic and international air
routes could have been breached in the incident just off Perth,
capital of Western Australia state.
</P>
<P>
"We have not ascertained whether any air routes were crossed
but we believe that at least one, maybe more than one air route,
has been infringed," Stray said.
</P>
<P>
Air Services Australia (ASA) said Tuesday that three FA-18
Hornets and an F-14 Tomcat from the aircraft carrier USS Carl
Vinson started operations over Perth controlled airspace about 3
p.m. Sunday before coordinating their activities with Perth air
traffic control.
</P>
<P>
The ASA said it made radio contact with the jets, taking part
in a flyover of the Swan River and the central business district
in Perth ahead of the arrival of the USS Vinson yesterday and they
were told to continue on their prearranged route.
</P>
<P>
The incident was downplayed by the ASA, which said although
technically regulations had been breached there was no threat to
other aircraft.
</P>
<P>
But Stray said any penetration of controlled air space without
clearance was serious.
</P>
<P>
"Particularly when it is over air routes, any violation of
controlled air space or entry of controlled air space without a
clearance is potentially very serious and particularly when it
crosses air routes flown by major carriers, there is always a
potential danger," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are talking about Australian-controlled air space; the
rules apply in our air space, just like if we were in the United
States American rules would apply. We would like to think that
they complied with the rules of air navigation."
</P>
<P>
He said it was not the first time that military aircraft had
not acknowledged instructions from air traffic controllers.
</P>
<P>
ASA said Tuesday that it had referred the incident to the
Australian Defense Force, the armed forces of Australia, to take
up with the U.S. Navy. Officers on the USS Vinson were reportedly
to conduct their own inquiry into the incident.

<HEADLINE> Scholars Discuss Legacy of Sun Yat-sen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua)-- A seminar on "Dr Sun Yat-sen and
Modern China" opened on Monday here, attracting more than 50
experts, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
Professors and historians from the Chinese mainland, Taiwan and
the United States are discussing the legacy of Dr Sun Yat-sen and
its influence on the future relationship between the two sides of
the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Sun (1866-1925) was the founder of the Kuomintang Party and the
Republic of China. Both the mainland and Taiwan revere Sun as the
forefather of modern China.
</P>
<P>
Sun provided the inspiration for the revolution that overthrew
the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) and led to the foundation of the
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day seminar, participants are exchanging their
latest academic research achievements.
</P>
<P>
Areas of discussion include Sun's thinking, nationalism, Sun
and the political development of modern China, relations between
the two sides of the Taiwan Straits, economic exchanges across the
straits, and China's future.
</P>
<P>
Taking the teachings of the sages of ancient China and adding
the best of Western thought and practice, Sun focused on the
unification of China and the salvation of the nation.
</P>
<P>
The seminar is sponsored by the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences and the History Association of Beijing, the paper says.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Lends 150 Million Dollars to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved on
Tuesday a loan of 150 million U.S. dollars to China for the
Liaoning Urban Transport Project, which will ease traffic flow in
three of the northeastern province's cities.
</P>
<P>
The project also is aimed at improving the urban air quality
through the use of unleaded fuel and catalytic converters in the
three cities -- Shenyang, Fushun and Anshan, the bank said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, infrastructure improvement in Shenyang
will allow public transport services to reach populations in the
northeast section of the city, where buses are unable to go
because they cannot clear a railway underpass. The project would
also improve the quality of public transport by creating exclusive
bus lanes, improving maintenance, and adding more bus stops, the
bank said.
</P>
<P>
The principal east-west corridors in Shenyang will also be
improved, and the project will create additional crossings of the
railway lines which divide the city.
</P>
<P>
In the city of Fushun, construction of a new river crossing
will ease the relocation of residents and businesses now situated
atop land subsiding due to coal pits in the south of the city.
They will go to a new district in the northeast of the city. The
project will also construct a major new east-west road corridor to
strengthen the urban transport network. Bus stops will be
established and bus and road maintenance will be supported.
</P>
<P>
In Anshan, improvements to the road network will provide access
to three industrial economic development zones to the south,
supporting the municipality's plans for economic diversification.
The project will finance the reconstruction of the main north-
south corridor and the construction of an interchange. The project
will also upgrade existing train lines, bus stops, and bicycle
paths.
</P>
<P>
The benefits of the Liaoning project include reduced travel
time for passengers and freight transport, lower transport costs
and increased reliability and safety of the urban transport system,
the World Bank said. It will also strengthen the policy-making,
regulatory, and implementation capacity of transport institutions,
it added.
</P>
<P>
Total costs of the Liaoning project are 383.9 million dollars.
The World Bank's loan is at the bank's standard interest rate
based on the London Interbank Offered Rate for U.S. dollar single-
currency loans, with a maturity of 15 years, including a five-year
grace period. The balance of 233.9 million dollars will be
provided by the Chinese government.

<HEADLINE> China's Trademark Law Needs Further Revision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- An intellectual property expert
is calling for an urgent amendment to the Trademark Law to check
various trademark infringements in order to standardize market
activities, today's China Daily said.
</P>
<P>
Trademark is playing an increasing role in determining an
enterprise's profits and survival, said Li Shunde, an intellectual
property expert with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
However, improperly registered trademarks have become a drag on
the standardization and internationalization of China's market
economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
China adopted the Trademark Law in 1982 and amended it in 1993.
</P>
<P>
He explained that an amendment to the law is urgently needed
because the current way of investigating and punishing trademark
infringement is ineffectual and in many cases the infringed party
is not properly compensated.
</P>
<P>
He believe that the revised law should clearly define various
trademark violations to ensure strict enforcement.
</P>
<P>
And it should include language regarding the timely
cancellation of improperly registered trademarks to minimize
damage to the infringed parties, added Li.
</P>
<P>
Li also urged domestic enterprises to enhance their awareness
of trademark registration, and said that those enterprises that
are tapping overseas markets in particular should register their
trademarks in the target market before selling their products
there.

MADRID, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian star Denilson who played
for Real Betis, said on Tuesday that he hoped to play in the
Italian League some day in future.
</P>
<P>
"Most players have a dream and mine is to play in Italy," said
Denilson, "I don't know when it will be - maybe in three years.
But it's still my dream."
</P>
<P>
Denilson joined Betis a year ago from Sao Paulo for a world
record of 34.8 million US dollars, but was always in the shadow of
Ronaldo at international level.
</P>
<P>
After failing to thrive in the Spanish league as the team was
crowded in the middle of the table, the Brazilian star was having
his own dream, saying "I dream of playing in Italy but that
doesn't necessarily mean next year."
</P>
<P>
"If I leave Betis it will not be for another Spanish side, that
would be unjust given the inter-team rivalry here," said Denilson.

WASHINGTON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- For once, Dennis Rodman was
involved but did not face any disciplinary action as his two
teammates were fined together with two of their opponents.
</P>
<P>
The NBA today fined forward Kurt Thomas and center Chris Dudley
of the New York Knicks and center Shaquille O'Neal and forward
Rick Fox of the Los Angeles Lakers for their actions in two
separate altercations in Sunday's game at the Great Western Forum.
</P>
<P>
Thomas was fined 5,000 dollars for flagrantly fouling Rodman to
the floor late in the third quarter after the two players became
entangled underneath the basket. Thomas was ejected after being
charged with a flagrant second foul.
</P>
<P>
After Rodman was thrown to the floor, Fox came over and pushed
Thomas while the other players attempted to restore order. As a
result, Fox was fined 2,000 dollars by the league for adding to
the altercation.
</P>
<P>
O'Neal was fined 3,500 dollars for pushing Dudley to the floor
after powering a thunderous dunk over him in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
Dudley was fined 2,500 dollars for retaliating by throwing the
ensuing inbounds pass off O'Neal's back from about 30 feet,
earning an ejection.
</P>
<P>
"I got frustrated, threw the ball," Dudley said after the game.
"He pushed me and I threw the ball at him. If it was vice versa,
he wouldn't have gotten ejected."

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices to Go Up in Philippines Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
prices of oil products are likely to increase after mid-April
following a recent resolution of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut down on oil production by April.
</P>
<P>
Press Secretary Rodolfo Reyes said Tuesday that the Department
of Energy noted an increase of at least 2 dollars in the price of
oil per barrel due to the OPEC decision to reduce oil production
by 2.1 million barrels to firm up the price of crude oil, the
newspaper Malaya reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the uptrend in crude prices for a longer period will
pressure oil companies to hike product prices. But he assured that
no price movement will take effect earlier than mid-April.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Fed Keeps Key Interest Rate Unchanged Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve said
Tuesday that it has decided to leave key interest rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The decision, which was made by the policy-setting Federal Open
Market Committee after its closed-door meeting, keeps the federal
funds overnight bank lending rate at 4.75 percent, the level it
has been at since it was last cut by a quarter percentage point in
last November. The discount rate on emergency loans from the
central bank remains steady at 4.50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Most of economists predicted the central bank would maintain
steady rates. Fed officials in recent weeks have emphasised that
the risks to the economy were "balanced" between the possibility
of overly rapid growth and the threat of economic sluggilshness
brought on by global economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
In an announcement noting their meeting had ended, the policy-
makers made no mention of a change in their thinking about the
likely direction of future interest rate moves.
</P>
<P>
The main source of suspense was whether the Fed would put into
practice a new policy of sometimes announcing changes in its
"bias", or the likely direction of future rate moves.
</P>
<P>
Analysts saw an outside chance that the Fed would announce
adopting a bias toward tighter monetary policy, which would signal
it was growing more concerned about an economic overheating. But
no such bias announcement was made at moment.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States said Tuesday
the Yugoslav proposals obtained by Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov fall "far short" of what must be done before The North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will halt its air campaign
against Serbia.
</P>
<P>
"We regard this suggestion as falling far short of what is
necessary in order for NATO to stop its air campaign," U.S. State
Department spokesman James Rubin said at a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Rubin referred to conditions laid down by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic during talks in Belgrade Tuesday with Primakov,
who later visited Bonn and reported details to German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
"Our position is clear. Milosevic must halt the offensive
against the Kosovar Albanians, withdraw his forces and embrace a
settlement based on the Rambouillet framework," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic insisted Tuesday that NATO attacks stop before he
moves toward peace, declaring his forces ready to fight "to the
very end." NATO answered with new resolve to wreck his military
with a relentless air assault.
</P>
<P>
More than six hours of talks with Primakov yielded a statement
by Milosevic that he was willing to rein in a harsh campaign
against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and resume peace talks if the
NATO strikes stopped.
</P>
<P>
A statement from Milosevic's office read on state-run
television said: "To open the space for negotiations, (NATO)
aggression on Yugoslavia has to stop immediately."
</P>
<P>
Milosevic also called for NATO troops in neighboring Macedonia
to be removed and a halt in alleged NATO support for the Kosovo
Liberation Army, the ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for
independence.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to defend our country to the very end. It is not
the first time Yugoslavia has had to defend itself and its right
to sovereignty and territorial integrity and national pride,"
Milosevic said.

<HEADLINE> China Urges NATO to Stop Air Strikes Against Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- China Tuesday urged the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to immediately cease its
military action against Kosovo so as to put the process of solving
the crisis there back on the track for a political settlement as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, Chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC) of
China, made the call at a brief press conference Tuesday evening
after meeting with his Greek counterpart Apostolos Kaklamanis on
bilateral ties and the international issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Li, who arrived here Tuesday afternoon on a four-day official
visit, said that the Chinese people were greatly concerned about
the air strikes by NATO against Kosovo and other areas of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
China firmly opposes NATO's military actions against
Yugoslavia, he said. The air strikes by NATO forces constituted a
grave violation of the international norms, infringed upon the
sovereignty of Yugoslavia, worsened the Balkan situation, and
endangered peace and stability in Europe.
</P>
<P>
China has always held that the internal affairs, including the
ethnic issue, in any country should be solved through appropriate
approaches and foreign countries should not interfere.
</P>
<P>
While valuing Greece's policy towards Kosovo problem, Li called
for unremitting international efforts to ease the situation in
Yugoslavia, and that in the Balkan region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
China opposes hegemonism and power politics, including the
acts of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries
under whatever pretext or in whatever form, the Chinese leader
reiterated.
</P>
<P>
Kaklamanis appreciated China's stance. He said that Greece,
located in the Balkans and a close neighbor to Yugoslavia, could
feel directly that its security was being threatened by the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The president reaffirmed that the Kosovo crisis could be solved
through political dialogue. It could only make things worse by
trying to use force to settle the issue.
</P>
<P>
He called for an early ending to the current crisis in Kosovo
which is sending a growing number of refugees to Greece and
threatening the stability of the country.

<HEADLINE> UN Panel Recommends to Improve Iraq's Humanitarian  Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has since 1990
experienced a shift from relative affluence to massive poverty, a
report form a UN panel says here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The panel, which was set up on January 30 according to a note
by the United Nations Security Council to assess the current
humanitarian situation in Iraq, says that even if stringent U.N.
sanctions against Iraq were lifted, "It will take a long time
before the infrastructure is repaired and the economy recovers."
</P>
<P>
While the panel says Iraq was responsible for some of the
problems in distributing supplies, particularly medicine, it made
clear that the U.N. "oil-for-food" program was inadequate,
particularly during periods of falling oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Only 41 percent of the population has regular access to clean
water and 83 percent of all schools need substantial repairs, and
the United Nations Development Program calculates it would take
7 billion U.S. dollars to rehabilitate the power sector to its
1990 capacity, the report says.
</P>
<P>
The panel did not suggest lifting sanctions against Iraq in the
report, but it made a strong case for easing them.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations made by the panel to improve the
humanitarian situation in Iraq include:
</P>
<P>
-- Authorising foreign oil companies under "bilateral
production sharing agreements" and U.N. supervision to export
spare parts Iraq needs for its dilapidated oil industry in order
to increase Iraq's crude production.
</P>
<P>
-- Authorising private investment in the oil industry and other
secondary export industries such as fertiliser, sulphur, urea,
dates nuts and agriculture in general.
</P>
<P>
-- Attempt to bring oil that Iraq sells illegally under the
oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
-- Temporarily reduce the 30 percent Iraq has to pay from its
oil revenues into a fund for Kuwaiti Gulf War victims.
</P>
<P>
-- The Security Council's Sanctions Committee should allow
food and medical supplies, agricultural equipment and basic
educational items to be imported by Iraq without notification.
Other items should be approved within two business days.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A controversial U.S. scientist
Tuesday defended human cloning as a legitimate treatment for
infertility, saying that the technology could also be used to
restore youth.
</P>
<P>
It would be impossible to stop human cloning because it was
such a huge intellectual challenge, Dr Richard Seed, who sparked
international outrage last year when he announced his intention to
make a copy of himself, told a London conference on human cloning.
</P>
<P>
"It will launch an entirely new field of research into life
processes. This challenge is absolutely irresistible and this will
result in the understanding of life," Seed said.
</P>
<P>
"The understanding of life is the intellectual challenge of the
third millennium," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Chicago-based scientists, who has a PHD in nuclear physics
and expertise in infertility treatment, also believed that cloning
is a legitimate solution for couples who have reproductive
problems and predicted a market for about 100,000 cloned babies a
year.
</P>
<P>
Dr Seed said that a race of human cloning has already started
with several laboratories are now competing to produce the first
human clone and once the technique has been perfected,
rejuvenation will be the next step.
</P>
<P>
"The torrent of research has already started. All the processes
for rejuvenation are already in place," he said.
</P>
<P>
Seed predicted that the first human clone would be announced
within two years.

<P>
ROME, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema said Tuesday that Italian warplanes have not been involved
in NATO's attacks against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement released by the prime minister's
office, during the recent NATO's military actions on Yugoslavia,
Italian warplanes are only flying missions within the framework of
"integrated defense".
</P>
<P>
D'Alema also said that "the nature of Italian military
participation in NATO operations and its commitment to solving the
Kosovo crisis will not change."
</P>
<P>
The statement was a response to news reports that Italian
warplanes had been involved in offensive missions.
</P>
<P>
According to D'Alema's office, Italian warplanes are deployed
for air defense, patrols and controls over the Adriatic Sea and
regions such as Bosnia and Macedonia where there is an Italian
participation of 3,500 soldiers in NATO peace missions, and in
protecting NATO planes involved in the attacks against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In his evening's televised address, D'Alema repeatedly stressed
Italy's desire to pursue initiatives for a diplomatic solution to
the Kosovo crisis, but voicing that the NATO's military option has

Department spokesman James Rubin said at a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Rubin referred to conditions laid down by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic during talks in Belgrade Tuesday with Primakov,
who later visited Bonn and reported details to German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
"Our position is clear. Milosevic must halt the offensive
against the Kosovar Albanians, withdraw his forces and embrace a
settlement based on the Rambouillet framework," Rubin said.

NEW YORK, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average
retreated from 10,000 points Tuesday as traders rushed into
profit-taking and the Coca-Cola company forecast its disappointing
earnings.
</P>
<P>
The Dow closed down 93.52 at 9,913.26, taking a breather after

Coca's forecast for its earnings drop disappointed the market.
The company said its sales would decline 1 percent to 2 percent in
case volume in the first quarter because of the worldwide economic
problem.

<P>
NEW YORK, March 30 (Xinhua) -- She made seven trips to China
last year and planned no less for the year 1999. She said she's
been doing a very significant job, environmental education in
China, the most populous country in the world.
</P>
<P>
Laura Utley, founder and chairman of New York-based Global
Communications for Conservation (GCC), launched cooperative
programs with China by the end of 1997 to create an
"environmentally aware" citizenry.
</P>
<P>
Under the programs called China Environmental Global Alliance
(CEGA), the non-profit American group delivered in early February
series of environmental education textbooks developed in the U.S.
and translated for use on a pilot basis in 33 primary and
secondary schools in Beijing. Its Chinese partner, The Ministry
of Science and Technology (MOST), facilitated a four-day training
program for teachers from the schools.
</P>
<P>
"I will fly to Beijing soon to find out if the textbooks are
properly used in the schools," said Laura in her office downtown
New York. Some 80,000 students are expected to benefit from the
textbooks within a year.
</P>
<P>
Laura is an international business woman who has been involved
in environment, conservation and wildlife protection efforts
throughout the world for the past 20 years. She believes that it
is extremely important to raise public awareness about the need to
care for and preserve environment.
</P>
<P>
As part of the joint efforts with China, GCC will arrange an
educational tour of several U.S. cities this fall for a group of
Chinese teachers, while Bradley F. Smith, Dean of Huxley College
of Environmental Studies at Western Washington University, will
lecture at Qinghua University &AMP; Capital Normal University in
Beijing on April 23.
</P>
<P>
GCC and its Chinese partner are also committed to creating an
enduring and substantial environmental knowledge base, absorbed
through an interactive, online learning educational method, said
Laura, who has been working closely with Deng Nan, vice minister
of China's State Science and Technology Commission in the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
"It is not at all an easy job, but we are ready to continue our
cooperation as long as need be," Laura said.
</P>
<P>
ENRON, an American green energy company, and the United Airline
have offered assistance to the multinational programs. However,
Laura stressed that she had never sought aid from the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
Laura said that she's invited to the dinner in honor of Premier
Zhu Rongji, who plans to visit New York on April 13. It is
reported that governmental cooperation in environmental protection
will also be discussed by Premier Zhu and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
"They are setting a good example for others to follow in terms
of U.S.-China relationship," said Misha Krakowsky, who has long
been pushing hard for the creation of multinational environmental
education partnership.

WASHINGTON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) air assault on Yugoslavia is far from
accomplishing its goals, but the alliance is pressing ahead with
an intensified targeting of Serb troop concentrations in Kosovo, a
U.S. defense official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"There has not been a knockout punch," said Defense Department

Bacon declined to predict how long it might take but said, "We
are prepared to go as long as it takes."
</P>

To step up NATO's attacks, five U.S. Air Force B-1 long-range
bombers were headed for Europe to join B-52 bombers that have been
launching cruise missiles at Yugoslavia since last Wednesday's
start of Operation Allied Force.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The following is a
statement by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday, the
second statement since the March 24 beginning of the NATO air
strikes against Yugoslavia, a sovereign and independent member of
the U.N. family:
</P>
<P>
"I am profoundly outraged by reports of a vicious and
systematic campaign of 'ethnic cleansing' conducted by Serbian
military and paramilitary forces in the province of Kosovo.
Concerned about what is happening there can only be heightened by
the fact that all independent international observers, including
even the International Committee of the Red Cross, have now been
obliged to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
Once again, a civilian population is being made to pay the
price for an unsolved political dispute. Civilian populations must
never come under indiscriminate and deliberate attack. Such
actions are in flagrant violations of established humanitarian
law.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is doing everything possible to alleviate
the suffering of displaced persons and refugees who are fleeing
Kosovo by the thousands every day. I have designated the High
Commissioner for Refugees as the lead agency to coordinate all
United Nations relief activities in the region. I appeal to all of
Kosovo's neighbors to give shelter and comfort to the helpless
civilians who have been driven from their homes. Borders must be
kept open. Safety and protection must be given to those in need.
I called upon the international community to give immediate
financial, material and logistical support to the authorities in
all countries where the refugees are arriving, particularly in
Albania, in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and in the
Republic of Montenegro (Federal Republic of Yugoslavia). Any
solution to the conflict must allow these unfortunate people to
return voluntarily to their homes in full security and dignity."

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Tuesday said that he was "profoundly outraged by
reports of a vicious and systematic campaign of 'ethnic
cleansing'" in Kosovo, and "the United Nations is doing everything
possible to alleviate the suffering of displaced persons and
refugees."
</P>
<P>
Annan made this remarks in his second statement on the issue of
Kosovo, a Serbian province, since NATO began bombing on March 24.
</P>
<P>
"I am profoundly outraged by reports of a vicious and
systematic campaign of 'ethnic cleansing' conducted by Serbian
military and paramilitary forces in the province of Kosovo," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Concerned about what is happening there can only be heightened

Meanwhile, the U.N. chief called upon the international
community to give immediate financial, material and logistical

are arriveing, particularly in Albania, in the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia, and in the Republic of Montenegro
(Federal Republic of Yugoslavia)."
</P>
<P>
"Any solution to the conflict must allow these unfortunate
people to return voluntarily to their homes in full security and
dignity," he added.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR Tuesday said in a report that around 94,000 Kosovars
have fled the province since May 24, and relief officials said
many more were en route.
</P>
<P>
"By Tuesday morning, 65,000 people had crossed into Albania,
20,000 into Montenegro and at least 9,000 into Macedonia," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Annan earlier has said that he has no plan to visit Kosovo,
currently under strong NATO bombardment and he has no plan of
being immediately and directly involved in addressing the Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia, a sovereign and
independent member of the U.N. family, is an illegal act because
it went ahead without the authorization of the U.N. Security
Council, which has the primary responsibility for the maintenance
of peace and security in the world at large.

<HEADLINE> UK Hospital Waiting Lists Fall Below Election Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Britain's National Health Service
waiting list fell 39,700 in February -- taking the number to below
that inherited by Labor at the last election, according to a
government report on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The February fall means that the government has met its pledge
to reduce waiting lists to below the level inherited from the
Conservatives one month early.
</P>
<P>
The total waiting list now stands at 1,119,700 -- 38,000 below
the figure inherited from the Tories on 1 May, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Health Secretary Frank Dobson said the government has invested
320 million pounds (528 U.S. dollars) in slashing waiting lists
and has pledged to cut them by a further 100,000 by the next
election.
</P>
<P>
"These record results have come about because the one million
staff of the NHS have made massive efforts, with massive
dedication and skill, to deliver what everyone in the country
wants - fewer people on NHS waiting lists," Dobson said.
</P>
<P>
However, doctors' leaders have warned the medical profession is
struggling to meet government targets, and claim the NHS is close
to buckling under the strain.
</P>
<P>
The number of people waiting more than 12 months for treatment
fell by 7,000 to 50,900 -- the lowest figure since June 1997.
</P>
<P>
No patient was waiting more than 18 months for treatment and
queues are now at their lowest levels since December 1996, the
government said.

CAIRO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- President of the Palestinian
National Authority Yasser Arafat is due to arrive in Cairo
Thursday morning for a brief visit, Palestinian ambassador to
Egypt Zohdi al-Qodra said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Qodra told reporters that during his short stay in Cairo,
Arafat will hold talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on
his recent meetings with leaders of European countries and the
United States on Palestinians' plan to declare an independent
state.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has announced that he would declare the Palestinian
state on May 4 when the five-year interim Palestinian self-rule
period under the Oslo Accord signed with Israel in 1993 expires.
</P>
<P>
But Arafat has been under mounting pressure from the West and
the Arab countries to postpone the declaration of statehood. It is
feared a unilateral declaration of Palestinian statehood would
further stalk the deadlocked Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He visited a number of European countries and the U.S.
recently in an effort to win their support and recognition for the
future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The Arafat-Mubarak meeting comes as part of the continued
coordination and consultations between the Palestinians and Egypt
in the light of the latest developments in the Middle East peace
process, Qodra said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian diplomat denounced Israel's threats over
Palestinians' possible declaration of statehood as contradictory
with the spirit of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He vowed that the Israeli threats will never stop the
Palestinians from establishing their own independent state with
Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Israel is opposed to the Palestinian plan, threatening to take
tough actions against the possible step, including annexation of
the parts of the West Bank under its control.

<HEADLINE> Aoshen Beats Flaming Bulls, Claims Semifinal Berth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Aoshen claimed a semi-
final berth of the Chinese first division basketball league after
the newcomer upset the third seed Shandong Flaming Bulls with a 2-
0 sweep win in the best-of-three- series Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Aoshen, who relegated with a perfect record in the second
division, downed the Flaming Bulls, third place last season, 91-81
to enter the last four.
</P>
<P>
The newcomer accompanied with defending champions the Bayi
Rockets and the Liaoning Hunters, both swept the playoff series 2-
0 after Wednesday's action.
</P>
<P>
The Rockets thrashed the Zhejiang Cyclone 147-100 in Ningbo,
Zhejiang Province, while the Hunters slimly escaped a decisive
game as the last season's runners-up disposed off the Beijing
Ducks 106-103 in Shenyang, Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The Aoshen will meet the Rockets in the semi-finals while the
Hunters' opponent will be the winner between the Guangdong Tigers
and the Shanghai Sharks, who tied the best-of-three series 1-1
when the Tigers avenged their lost Sunday, beating the Sharks 93-
79 in Dongguan, Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
To avoid an embarrassed sweep by the Aoshen, the Flaming Bulls
opened the game with a 11-0 run.
</P>
<P>
The Aoshen, who crashed the Bulls 115-86 three day's ago,
pulled close within five points in the second quarter before the
home team ran away again to call the interval on a 53-40 lead.
</P>
<P>
But the solid defense paid off for the Aoshen in the second
half while the home team seemed tired when they came back again.
</P>
<P>
The visitors led the third quarter 70-68 and never trailed in
the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
In the contest for 9th to 12th places, the Jilin Northeast
Tigers won the series with a 2-0 straight win after day's 96-84
victory in Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
The Sichuan Pandas also avoided a third game against the Jinan
Army with a 109-101 win in Yantai, Shandong Province, also most
ensured to stay in the first division.
</P>
<P>
The last match between the Guangdong Tigers and the Shanghai
Sharks will be played on April 2 in Dongguan.

PARIS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Six more French warplanes will join
the NATO Armada engaged in the bombing operations against
Yugoslavia, said French Defense Minister Alain Richard on
Wednesday.

Agence France-Presse quoted Richard as saying the unspecified

</P>
<P>
Forty French warplanes, including 12 Mirage 2000 sophisticated

</P>
<P>
But local press reports said that French warplanes have only
dropped eight bombs against Yugoslav anti-air defense systems,
while many French warplanes flew back to their base in Istrana,
Italy, without completing their missions because of "weather

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) said here Wednesday that 19
ambassadors of the alliance just assessed and discussed the
situation in Kosovo, agreeing to a change in range and tempo in
the air campaign operation.
</P>
<P>
Jamie Shea, the NATO spokesman, told a news briefing that some
press reports said Wednesday that NATO had decided to go to phase
III. "This is not the case," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday simply to clarify what was happened," the NATO
supreme command was authorized by the secretary-general after
consultation with allies to extend the range and tempo of
operation in order to maximize the effectiveness of the campaign.
"But this is not Phase III as such," the spokesman told reporters
at the Brussels-based headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Shea also told reporters that NATO welcomed all efforts by the
international community to seek a political solution to the Kosovo
crisis. He said NATO very much appreciated the efforts made by
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeni Primakov and his team Tuesday to go
to Belgrade at a very difficult time and to try to make the
Yugoslav government change course.
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the hardest tasks in international diplomacy
today" since many envoys had shown their experiences over the last
few weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, Mr. Primakov yesterday was not able to achieve
success. As Chancellor Shroeder and Prime Minister Blair,
President Clinton, many other leaders made clear that the offer of
Milosevic fell completely short of our requirements," Shea said.
</P>
<P>
He also said President Milosevic offered no end to the fighting
even while Primakov was in Belgrade and fighting was continuing in
Kosovo. "He offered no guarantee regarding the withdrawal of his
forces, many of which clearly remained in the field ready to
start."
</P>
<P>
"So we have drawn the obvious only conclusion which is that we
have to continue, and we will continue," the NATO spokesman said.
