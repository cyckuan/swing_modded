<HEADLINE> Chechen Terrorists Demand "Corridor" for Escape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chechen terrorists, who are
holding some 300 hostages in a small village near the
Daghestani-Chechenani border, agreed today to free all the
hostages if Russian troops open "a corridor" for their safe return
to home, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Daghestani Deputy Interior Minister Gennady
Shpigun tonight as saying that the terrorists "agreed to all
conditions of Russian forces provided that unobstructed entry to
Chechnya is ensured to them."
</P>
<P>
The Chechen militants agreed to release all hostages, "but only
after they are safely back to Chechnya," Shpigun added.
</P>
<P>
Now Russian troops have made a double circle around the
village.
</P>
<P>
The terrorists headed by Salman Raduyev, the son-in-law of
rebel Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev, stormed into the
Daghestani city of Kizlyar early Tuesday morning and captured over
3,000 hostages.
</P>
<P>
Hearing the information, Russian President ordered his "power
ministers" to take "the most resolute measures" to settle the
hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
As a result of talks and "force pressure," the terrorists
released nearly 3,000 hostages on Wednesday morning. In exchange,
they were allowed to leave the city for home. However, they took
over some 160 hostages along as guarantors of safe passage.
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday noon, their convoy of 11 buses and two trucks
stopped in the village of Pervomaiskoye, some 10 kilometers away
from the Daghestani-Chechen border, because the bridge, which
should have brought them home, had been blown up reportedly by
Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the terrorists, whose number is estimated at
250, put the 300 hostages around their convoy and their positions,
making them as "a life shield." In the evening, they removed the
human shield around them, moving the hostages to a local school,
mosque and buses.
</P>
<P>
The Chechens promised to free women and children if manoeuvres
of Russian troops' armored vehicles around the closed area are
stopped.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations have been resumed and might continue through
the night.
</P>
<P>
There has also been a report from Daghestan's security service
that a massive build-up of Chechen militants is seen on Chechnya's
east border with Daghestan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, regional administrations of the North Caucasus
called on Yeltsin to order tough measures against the Chechen
terrorists.

 Emoluments
</P>
<P>
LAGOS, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Ministry of the
Federal Capital Territory (FCT) will save more than three million
Naria (about 36,000 US dollars) monthly in staff emoluments.
</P>
<P>
FCT Minister Jerry Useni was quoted today by the News Agency
of Nigeria as saying that the ministry used to pay out more than
28 million Naira monthly as staff salaries and emoluments, but
would now need only 25 million Naira since the ministry has
discovered 116 ghost workers on the payroll of the ministry and
the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA).
</P>
<P>
The 116 identified ghost workers include those who do not have
adequate records, who have died, absconded, resigned and who were
found to have been either sacked or transferred from the services
of the ministry and the FCDA.
</P>
<P>
Useni said that he had constituted a six-member committee to
look into the issue of ghost workers in the ministry, its
parastatals and the four area councils in capital Abuja, and to
recommend appropriate disciplinary action against those involved.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Banks to Negotiate on Marcos Deposits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Two large Swiss banks will
arrange negotiations in Hong Kong next week to resolve a
decade-long dispute over claims to the estimated 475 million U.S.
dollars deposited by the late president of the Philippines,
Ferdinand Marcos.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which will start Monday, will for the first time
bring together all parties to legal disputes over who gets the
estate which has been blocked in accounts at two of the big three
Swiss banks, Swiss Bank Corporation and Swiss Credit Bank since
March 1986.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss deposits represent a fraction of the billions of
dollars that Marcos, who died in exile in 1989, and his widow,
Imelda, are accused of looting from the Philippines in their 20
years in power.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government has been trying for nearly a decade
to recover the cash that the Marcos family had supposedlly hoarded
overseas. Manila puts the total at more than five billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Marcos family also has been trying all legal means to avoid
the losses of the forture.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, nearly 10,000 Filipinos are also trying to collect
on a 1.9 billion dollars judgement against the fortune of Marcos,
stemming from a human rights case.
</P>
<P>
The Filipinos were awarded the money in compensations last
February after a U.S. judge in Honolulu ruled that Marcos was
responsible for major human rights abuses of fellow Filipinos. The
compensations were also expected to come from Marcos's deposits in
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
After almost a decade of legal wrestling, Swiss prosecutors
announced last August that the money in Swiss banks would be
shipped back to the Philippines after the ownership lawsuit is
settled.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent effort to avoid court orders in different
countries that could force them to pay multiple claim, which means
they might be asked to hand out the same money at least twice, the
two Swiss banks involved decided to hold the Hong Kong
negotiations which they hope could resolve the ownership issue.
</P>
<P>
Chester Crocker, chairman of the U.S. Institute of Peace and a
former Assistant Secretary of State in the Reagen administration,
was recruited to supervise the talks.

<P>
KAMPALA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's Minister for Foreign
Affairs Ruhakana Rugunda today urged the international community
to supplement efforts of countries in this sub-region to get a
lasting solution to problems in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal during a meeting with Ciangiacomo Migone,
the President of the Commission for Foreign Affairs in the
Italian Parliament here today.
</P>
<P>
Migone had just concluded a visit to Burundi during which he
met representatives of the government and opposition groups and
exchanged ideas with them on how to bring peace to that central
African country.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan Foreign Minister and his Italian guest agreed that
there was need for openness, commitment and a spirit of
reconciliation on the part of contending forces in Burundi for
the good of all the people in the country and the sub-region as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks there has been a significant escalation of
armed conflicts in Burundi. Violence between the Tutsi-led
Burundian Army and Hutu armed groups, once largely confined to
the north and west, appears to be spreading south and east,
bringing death, displacement and suffering to areas once
considered stable. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako
Ogata, said that a virtual civil war is raging in Burundi with
massacres and other "terrible things" rife.

UNITED NATIONS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The world economy will

half-year update of the United Nations' World Economic and Social
Survey.
</P>
<P>
The Survey, which was available on Friday, said the output
growth in developed countries slowed in 1995, but it is expected
to remain at 2.5 percent in 1996, as policy makers keep inflation
low and focus on budget deficits.
</P>

The developing economies grew 5 percent in 1995, as expected,
and the outlook for 1996 is for 5.5 percent, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Transition economies are on track for their first year of
overall growth in 1996, the survey estimated. It added that 1995
was better than expected in Central and Eastern Europe and 1996 is
called "beginning of the end of transition".

BEIRUT, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) today denied a report that it was recruiting
fresh bloods in Lebanon for the Palestinian police force in the
Palestinian self-ruled areas of Gaza Strip and West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Sultan Abu Al-Ainin, the PLO's representative in Lebanon, was
quoted by the Lebanese Central News Agency as saying that he has
not received any order from the Palestinian leadership in Gaza to
send Palestinian fighters to Gaza.
</P>
<P>
"The departure of the Palestinian fighters (from Lebanon)
needs a collection of administrative and legal proceedings and
talks between the PLO leadership and the Lebanese authority," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the PLO leadership and the Lebanese government
have not held talks on this issue.
</P>
<P>
The PLO official clarified that a departure of any batch of the
Palestinian fighters to take jobs in the Palestinian authority
needs a "full agreement" between the PLO and the Lebanese
government.
</P>
<P>
On the report that the pro-Arafat Fatah faction was collecting
light weapons in Ain Al-Hilweh, the largest Palestinian refugee
camp in Lebanon, he said that the move was aimed to enhance the
security in the Palestinian refugee camps in this country.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Palestinian have been undertaking this
work for three years.
</P>
<P>
Beirut-based newspaper, As-Safir, reported that some 450 Fatah
fighters who are supposed to Leave this time, are scattered in
various refugee camps in Lebanon, including Ain Al-Hilweh near the
southern Lebanese port city of Saida.
</P>

The newspaper said the Lebanese authorities had no objection
to the departure of Palestinians to their land as long as Israel
agreed.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Police in Greece's northern city
of Salonika have expressed fears that a large quantity of
Russian-made automatic weapons have been channelled to organized
criminals in the country.
</P>
<P>
A gang was alleged to have smuggled seven Kalashnikov assault
rifles and a large quantity of ammunition into the country from
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Their fears follow the arrest of an ethnic Greek from Georgia,
Theoktistos Kritharidis, after the rifles were found in his car.
</P>
<P>
According to the police today, Kritharidis said that he
obtained the rifles from two Georgians from Tbilisi who visit
Greece often, adding that he had intended to sell them to a person
whom he refused to identify for 1 million drachmas (4,300 US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Kritharidis was arrested after police received a tip-off that
arms being smuggled into the country from countries of the former
Soviet Union were being sold to organized criminal gangs in
Greece.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Salonika police seized two Kalashnikov rifles
and five Russian-made revolvers, while last year they broke up a
gang of Serbs and Skopjans who had been smuggling arms into Greece
from the war zones in former Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> UK Personage Refutes Attacks on China's Family  Planning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A well-placed British personage
today defended China's family planning policy, saying that it is
the right way to solve the problem of sustainability.
</P>
<P>
In an article published in the Independent newspaper, David
Bellamy, president of Britain's Population Concern, said, "Having
visited China on a number of occasions, I have seen the problems
its people face and the way they have... tackled the problem of
sustainability."
</P>
<P>
"So I know that the sad stories in the media this week, of
children left to die in orphanages, are only a small part of the
story."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the film screened last Tuesday by Britain's
Channel Four TV station, which, by picking up few isolated cases
in certain areas, distorted the actual situation in China's child
welfare institutions in an attempt to defame China and its family
planning policy.
</P>
<P>
The article said that during the late sixties, China came to
the conclusion that although it could feed one billion people, it
could not go on meeting the needs of an ever-increasing
population. So it instituted the policy of one-child family.
</P>
<P>
Recent surveys of students in China show that the majority of
young people agree that the policy is the only way ahead, and the
vast majority want to delay marriage beyond the minimum legal age,
it said.
</P>
<P>
It went on to note that malnutrition and rural poverty in China
are symptoms of overpopulation.
</P>
<P>
The article said that as far as sustainability is concerned,
"the West has much to learn from China, for, from those
willow-pattern landscapes which are not particularly well endowed
with toptrade agricultural soils, it has contrived to feed its 1.2
billion people adequately".
</P>
<P>
"If the Western way of life is to be the role model, why are
our dole queues so long? Why are the infrastructures of so many of
our cities falling to pieces? Why are there more black teenagers
in American prisons than in American universities?"
</P>
<P>
"The answer is unsustainability," the article said.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy also noted that overpopulation is a global problem with
the world's population predicted to exceed 6 billion by the year
2000. It has "profound dangerous implications for the future of
the world" and this is "no time for complacency," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Claims To Suffer Largely From Malaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Health
Ministry official said today that his country is one of the few
in Africa largely hit by malaria epidemics.
</P>
<P>
Tarekegn Abosse, head of the country's malaria and other
vector borne diseases control unit, made the claim at the opening
of a national meeting on the prevention of malaria.
</P>
<P>
Tarekegn said the country's landscape and pattern of rainfall
levelled a fertile ground for the recurrence of malaria epidemic,
a case which is like in Namibia and a few other African
countries.
</P>
<P>
While in other African countires children are the most
vulnerable, Ethiopian people are indiscriminately affected by
malaria.

<HEADLINE> British Aid Agency Pulls Out Of Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A British aid agency yesterday
pulled out of the self-declared, but internationally
unrecognised, republic of Somaliland, a report reaching here
today said.
</P>
<P>
Save the Children Fund (SCF) said it was leaving the
Somaliland capital Hargeisa because of the "operational and
security problems inside the country".
</P>
<P>
The British agency has operated in Somaliland since 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Somaliland authorities said yesterday it had repulsed an
attack southeast of Hargeisa by "opposition forces."
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Ibrahim Egal, the self-styled president of Somaliland,
has been fighting with rival clan militiamen allied with Somali
faction leader General Mohamed Farah Aideed since November, 1994,
but has failed to subdue them.
</P>
<P>
Somaliland in northern Somalia covers the area of the former
British Somaliland protectorate, which joined with the former
Italian-administered Somalia in l960, when Somalia gained
independence.
</P>
<P>
However, it broke away from the rest of Somalia when a civil
war erupted in the Horn of Africa country in l991. enditem

<HEADLINE> UK Commercial Vehicle Sales Rise by 9.6% in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Commercial vehicle sales in
Britain rose strongly for the third successive year in 1995, with
the industry projecting further growth, but at a slower rate, over
the next two years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders
(SMMT) show that sales of all types of commercial vehicle, from
light vans to buses, were 9.6 percent higher, at 249,928, compared
with the previous year's 228,083.
</P>
<P>
The growth was led by the heavy trucks sector, in which
registrations jumped by more than 20 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The total commercial vehicle registrations for last month were
13,737, an 8 percent rise on December 1994.
</P>
<P>
The SMMT forecasts that overall commercial vehicle
registrations will rise by a further 3.5 percent this year and by
2.6 percent in 1997 to reach 265,400 units.
</P>
<P>
However, it believes that truck sales next year will be only
1.5 percent higher, but with a further rise of 5.7 percent in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Imports took a larger share of the total market last year,
rising to 45.6 percent from the previous year's 43.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> World Crude Steel Output Rises by 3.5% in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe (UN/ECE) has recently reported that the
world crude steel production totalled 750.6 million tonnes in
1995, 3.5 percent or 25.1 million tonnes more than in 1994.
</P>
<P>
An increase was registered in both developed and developing
countries, said a report issued Wednesday. Compared to 1994, crude
steel output grew by 3.6 percent in the United States, 2.6 percent
in the European Union countries and 3.1 percent in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries, especially those in Asia, are taking the
place of the developed countries as the center of steel procution,
said the report. Last year, the output rose by 8.8 percent from
33.7 million tonnes to 36.7 million tonnes in South Korea, while
growing by 11.4 percent to top the level of 20 million tonnes in
India.
</P>
<P>
In China, crude steel output increased by about 2.2 percent
from 91.5 million tonnes to 93.5 million tonnes.
</P>
<P>
In Latin America, crude steel production rose by 5.6 percent as
a whole with a 12 percent increase recorded in Argentina and 17.7
percent in Mexico as well as a 2.2 percent fall in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
ECE reported an increase of 6.5 percent in overall crude steel
ouput for the Central European countries, with a decline in
production only in Hungary and Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
The output in CIS countries amounted to more than 78 million
tonnes, registering a slight increase of 0.2 percent over 1994. In
Russia, the output reached 51.1 million tonnes, 4.8 percent or 2.3
million tonnes more than in 1994, while Ukraine posted a sharp
fall of about 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the ECE report, in 1995, Japan remained the
world's largest steel producer and was the only country with an
output exceeding the 100 million tonne level. It was followed by
China, the United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Germany ranked the fifth on the list, with an output of some
41.8 million tonnes, 2.5 percent more than in 1994. South Korea
came in the sixth place.

his peace efforts to the war-torn Afghanistan.
</P>

<P>
LONDON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Ireland today voiced strong
opposition to a British plan to build a huge underground nuclear
laboratory in northwestern England.
</P>
<P>
Irish Energy Minister Emmet Stagg told a press conference today
Ireland might take Britain to the European Court of Justice if the
plan for a so-called Rock Characterisation Facility (RCF) went
ahead.
</P>
<P>
Stagg made the statement at the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing
plant where he is giving evidence to a public inquiry into the 190
million pounds (about 290 million US dollars) project.
</P>
<P>
"I see the RCF as a first step towards an eventual underground
dump for the permanent storage of nuclear waste," Stagg said.
</P>
<P>
The Irish minister made it clear that the risk that nuclear
material would leak into the Irish Sea was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
"The Irish government is most strongly opposed to any proposal
that could lead to the construction of a permanent storage or
disposal site for nuclear materials next to the Irish Sea," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Major Rejects Thatcher's Criticism on His Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major today rejected a call by his predecessor for a return to the
right-wing agenda that she laid down in 1980s.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports, Major said today that Baroness
Thatcher must be "baffled" by reports that the lecture she made
last night has damaged the unity of the Conservative party.
</P>
<P>
Major said that the Conservative party has always been a one
nation party. "I will not be pushed off what I believe to be
right," he pledged.
</P>
<P>
Major declared that his policies, including low taxes, were the
same as in 1979 when Lady Thatcher came to power.
</P>
<P>
He said that he also strongly agreed with Thatcher's warning
about the dangers of a Labor government and her economic
prescription for prosperity.
</P>
<P>
But he rejected Thatcher's attack on the One Nation
Conservatism, saying, "We live and we win in the center-right of
politics."
</P>
<P>
The phrase "One Nation Conservatism" embodies a traditional
Conservative notion of caring for society's underprivileged as
well as its achievers.
</P>
<P>
Lord Howe, former foreign secretary and one of leading
left-wingers, also said Lady Thatcher's deep hostility to Europe
led to her damaging dismissal of "One Nation" Tories.
</P>
<P>
He said that Lady Thatcher's "latter-day obsession" with Europe
risked damaging her reputation and the achievements of her
governments.

<HEADLINE> Labor Party: Early Elections Depend on Talks with Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Labor Party
Secretary-General Nissim Zvilli indicated today that his party is
still pondering the question of whether to hold early Knesset
(parliament) elections, saying that it will depend on progress in
the talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the decision will be taken within a month,
according to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
If there is no chance of a breakthrough in negotiations with
Syria, he said, then the Labor-led government will have to
complete its agenda and elections will accordingly be moved
forward.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Shimon Peres has reportedly told party officials
that if the elections are to be advanced, the date, from his
point of view, should be June 4.
</P>
<P>
The subject of early elections has been raised among the ranks
of the country's two large parties, Labor and Likud, ever since
the assassination of late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin on November
4, last year.
</P>
<P>
Labor activists advocate early elections because, under current
circumstances, Labor is far ahead of Likud in terms of public
support. Leading Likud politicians call for early elections
presumably for fear that the government should go ahead with its
plan to reach agreement with Syria at the expense of abandoning
the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Peres seems adamant that he will give first priority to peace
talks with Damascus, claiming that peace is more important than
elections. He said Wednesday that as long as the peace process
with Syria continues, he will not call for early elections.
</P>
<P>
"It is a shame to waste a single day on electioneering, if that
day can be devoted to the peace process. We will stop only when we
have to, if there is no other choice," Peres told new members of
the Labor Party in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Peres explained that such a contingency could arise "if
anything happens to cause us to lose our parliamentary majority."
</P>
<P>
"In such an eventuality, there will be no choice
but to go to the people. However, barring such developments,
we plan to fully carry out the mandate given us by the
voters," he said.

<HEADLINE> Primakov Outlines Russia's Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Russia's new Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov outlined the Kremlin's foreign policy today,
stressing the need to practise an all round diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russia's foreign policy should tally with the
country's power status and meet its national interests.
</P>
<P>
Primakov held a news conference in his ministry's press center
this afternoon as his first public appearance since he was
appointed Foreign Minister by President Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the priority task for his ministry is to strengthen
relations with "the near abroad," or other member countries of the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), particularly in the
economic sphere.
</P>
<P>

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher will meet with new Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov early next month to discuss the U.S.-Russia
relations, the State Department has announced.
</P>
<P>
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters on Thursday
that the meeting was proposed by Christopher during an
introductory telephone call to Primakov from Jerusalem Thursday
morning. The U.S. secretary of state is carrying out shuttle
diplomacy in the Middle East in a fresh effort to break the
impasse over the Israel-Syria peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"They've agreed that in the first week of February they will
get together. They could not set up a time because...they didn't
have their schedules with them," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
He declined to give the location of the U.S.-Russia foreign
ministers meeting.
</P>
<P>
Burns disclosed that Christopher had also sent Primakov a
formal letter of congratulations for his appointment as the new
Russian foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
In a welcome gesture, Primakov told Christopher that Russia's
parliament will move to ratify the second Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty (START II) signed by the U.S. and Russian presidents in
early 1993.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, told reporters that Christopher and his new Russian
counterpart will mainly discuss the agenda for the nuclear summit
scheduled to be held in April in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will involve the Group of Seven major
industrialized nations and Russia in discussions of policies to
prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that Christopher and Primakov will try to
work out an agenda for bilateral meeting between U.S. President
Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin during the
summit.

LONDON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- English Premiership soccer clubs
Tottenham and Wimbledon were banned from European competition for
one year by UEFA on Friday for fielding their under-strength teams
in last season's Intertoto Cup.
</P>
<P>
Both teams sent their youth squads to last summer's inaugural
European new event which offers the prize of A UEFA Cup place to
the winner.
</P>
<P>
English clubs have already been punished as a result of the
Intertoto Cup shambles with one place being withdrawn from next
season's UEFA Cup.
</P>
<P>
The Football Association had been struggling to find English
sides to enter the competition and both clubs were reluctant
entrants in the new competition.
</P>
<P>
Wimbledon had to borrow second division Brighton's Goldstone
Ground to play their home matches and loaned players from other
clubs.
</P>
<P>
Both clubs clearly angered UEFA president Lennart Johansson who
made that point clear when announcing in Birmingham last month
that England would lose a place in next year's UEFA Cup.

<HEADLINE> Russia Replaced by Poland at HK New Year's Soccer Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Russia, originally one of the
four teams set for the Carlsbery Cup soccer tournament during this
year's Spring Festival, has been replaced by Poland, organizers
of the annual event announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Other teams for the event slated for February 19 and 22 this
year to usher in the Chinese lunar new year, are the national
squads of Japan and Sweden as well as a combined Hong Kong side
with players from local league clubs.
</P>
<P>
According to information received here late Thursday, the
Russian Soccer Union claimed that it could not send their best
players for the Hong Kong meet.
</P>
<P>
Neither champions club Moscow Spartak nor other Russian clubs
were happy to have their players called up for too much
international duty, because of a planned build-up for the European
championships later this year in England.
</P>
<P>
"So obviously a very complex situation exists at present
between the Russian Soccer Union and professional clubs, not to
mention the complex political situation as well, in the country,"
said Derek Currie, a spokesman of the organizers.
</P>
<P>
The Polish national team immediately canceled a planned trip to
a training camp in Germany, after being contacted by the Hong Kong
Football Association, so as to compete in the Hong Kong event,
Currie said.
</P>
<P>
The Polish Soccer Federation, upset over their failure to
qualify for the European Championships, has appointed a new coach
to reinforce its efforts to win the World Cup qualifying rounds
against England and Italy, other teams in Poland's group.
</P>
<P>
A drawing ceremony is scheduled for January 25 for pairing the
four participating teams.

<HEADLINE> No Change in HK's Pegging System after 1997: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The pegging system for Hong
Kong dollars will remain unchanged after the year of 1997,
according to a senior Chinese bank official of the Hong Kong
Branch of the Bank of China Group.
</P>
<P>
Yang Zilin, general manager of the group, stressed that so far
the pegging system (keeping the Hong Kong currency directly pegged
to the US dollar) has worked so well and the system is beneficial.
</P>
<P>
Yang made the remark Thursday in his first English television
interview by CNBC Asia since being named Chairman of the Hong Kong
Association of Banks.
</P>
<P>
The pegged system is more beneficial than a disadvantage to the
Hong Kong financial operation and bank operations, he said,
adding that "so I can't see after 1997 how it would immediately
change."
</P>
<P>
Yang also vowed that the style of banking in Hong Kong "won't
be changed" now that he has assumed leadership of the Hong Kong
Association of Banks.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the association will follow the traditional way
of operation in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Increased Profits for Agricultural Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Agricultural Bank of China
has reported a 200 percent rise in profits for 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to ABC officials, the bank had pre-tax profits of
three billion yuan (about 363 million US dollars) last year,
compared with 1.1 billion yuan the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Bank head, Shi Jiliang, says the improved profits were the
result of bank efforts to improve management and reform internal
operations.
</P>
<P>
"The improved financial status has put our bank in a better
position to compete in the domestic market and signals a good
start in the long process of becoming a real commercial bank," Shi
said at a press briefing here today.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the bank's deposits grew by 196.6 billion yuan and
lending increased by 102.9 billion yuan, representing a respective
growth of 29 and 18.6 percent. Agriculture and township enterprise
loans totalled 702.9 billion yuan, up 13 percent over the previous
year, said Shi.
</P>
<P>
To improve management and efficiency, the bank is experimenting
with the asset-liability ratio in its branches in 12 provinces and
cities, and has merged or closed 2,200, or 4.5 percent, of its
outlets below the county level.
</P>
<P>
The past year also saw the bank's international business
expanding significantly. By the end of 1995, it had 3.3 billion US
dollars of foreign currency deposits and 4.6 billion US dollars of
foreign currency loans.
</P>
<P>
At present, the bank has branches in Hong Kong and Singapore
and has established business ties with over 300 overseas
banks.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The securities market in
Shanghai, China's financial hub, rose in the first part of this
week, then dropped, continuing its fluctuating movement.
</P>
<P>
The All Stock Index of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, one of two
in China, closed at 546.83 points, 1.95 percent higher than the
final closing of last week. Shares worth 2.827 billion yuan
changed hands, 85.5 percent more than last week.
</P>
<P>
On January 8, the first trading day of the week, the index rose
because funds on the Shanghai bourse all gained ground, but a
paltry 287 million yuan-worth of shares was traded.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, all A-shares advanced, a rare phenomenon in recent
weeks, pushing the index to its close at 558.61 points with a
turnover at 803 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The index slipped two times in a row on Wednesday and Thursday,
and the trade volume dwindled at the same time. But today, the
last trading day, saw the index gain back a little lost ground and
the trade volume increased slightly.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Shanghai's securities market performed
weakly this week because investors have less confidence, and have
diverted large amounts of money to the floating of the first batch
of paperless treasury bonds, worth 13.5 billion yuan, that started
this week.
</P>
<P>
Some shareholders who believe that the securities market will
not rebound in the near future will show more enthusiasm for the
treasury bond market, the analysts pointed out.

year, bringing the figure for the Eighth Five-Year Plan period
(1991-95) to more than one trillion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released here today by the General
Administration of Customs, China's imports in 1995 amounted to
132.08 billion US dollars, 16.69 billion US dollars less than
exports for that year.
</P>
<P>
Total foreign trade volume for the period doubled the figure
for the previous five years, and it is likely to put China in the
ranks of the world's top ten traders.
</P>
<P>
China's trade volume of 115.44 billion US dollars in 1990 put
the country in 15th place in the world, and two years later, it
moved into 11th place, a position it maintained for three years
running.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, China's trade volume was 12 billion US dollars less
than that of Belgium-Luxembourg, which was listed as the tenth
largest trader in the world.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that a conspicuous part of China's foreign
trade development over the past five years has been the rapid
growth of value of imports and exports of enterprises with
overseas investment, which increased from 20.1 billion US dollars
in 1990 to last year's 109.8 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
As the country's market pluralism strategy for exports
gradually was implemented, China did business with more countries
and regions, and the number of its trade partners jumped from 180
in 1990 to 227 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Trade officials here attribute the growth to the implementation
of the country's reform policy and opening to the outside world as
well as to the stable and healthy development of the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
In spite of this achievement however, China still needs to do a
lot to realize its goal for 2000, of imports and exports totalling
400 billion US dollars annually, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
They said they believe, however, that China's foreign trade
will hit a new high in the next five years as the country's free
trade system with Chinese characteristics moves ahead step by
step.

BONN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- South African boxer Frans Botha
failed a doping test after he won the International Boxing
Federation (IBF) world heavyweight boxing title last month, the
German boxing federation announced here on Friday.

Federation vice president Mario Hille said that a first urine

Hille said that if a second urine sample also tested positive,
the title will be declared null and void and Botha could face
sanctions by the IBF.

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto Pledges Reform to Create a New Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Japan's new Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto today vowed to make efforts to create a new
Japan by reforming the nation's political, administrative and
economic systems.
</P>
<P>
In his first press conference since assuming the power
Thursday, Hashimoto said his government gives priority to putting
the Japanese economy on track, recovering domestic and overseas
confidence in the nation's financial system and promoting ties
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
The 58-year old premier urged the Diet, which will convene a
150-day regular session January 22, to pass the 75.1 trillion yen
(751 billion U.S. dollars) budget for fiscal 1996, so that his
administration can continuously implement economic pump priming
measures.
</P>
<P>
On a controversial government plan to spend taxpayers' money to
dispose of the bad debt of failed housing loan companies, he said
the spending of public money is "unvoidable" to restore both
domestic and overseas confidence in Japan's financial system.
</P>
<P>
Concerning Japan's relations with the United States, Hashimoto
said, "I have always thought and will continue to think that the
bilateral relationship is the most important diplomatic
relationship for Japan."
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes the United States will understand the "pains
of Okinawa" and agree to reduce the U.S. military bases on the
island.
</P>
<P>
Increasing numbers of Japanese people have come to question the
Japan-U.S. security setup and the U.S. military presence in Japan,
following the rape of a local schoolgirl in Okinawa in September
last year, for which three U.S. servicemen are on trial.

<TEXT>

MANILA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today swept aside as pure speculation reports that the country is
veering toward a martial rule.
</P>
<P>
"There is no such thing as the Ramos administration trying to
create the capability to enter into a martial law situation," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The president said that his administration's intensified
efforts to stamp out criminality and smash terrorist groups signal
not the return of martial law but a determination to achieve peace
and order across the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ramos said that media reports that he has already
accepted the resignations of some cabinet members were "pure
speculation" and "wild guesses."
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers today reported the alleged acceptance by Ramos
of the resignations of Trade and Industry Secretary Rizalino
Navarro, Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Antonio Carpio and
National Security Adviser Joese Almonte.

<HEADLINE> Patent Battle Over Gene Between Britain, U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A patent battle is going on
between British and American teams over the discovery of a gene,
which, when defective, causes one-third of inherited breast tumors.
</P>
<P>
Dr Michael Stratton and his team at the Institute of Cancer
Research, in Sutton, Surrey, announced the discovery, BRCA2, in
the British science journal Nature shortly before Christmas, and
showed how defects in it led to cancer.
</P>
<P>
However, a team at Myriad Genetics, a company in Salt Lake
City, Utah, claims that it isolated the gene first, according to
Thursday's issue of New Scientist.
</P>
<P>
Both Myriad and the Cancer Research Campaign (CRC), which
funded Dr Stratton's work, have applied for patents on BRCA2.
</P>
<P>
Dr Stratton's group and that of Dr Mark Skolnick, a researcher
at the University of Utah who founded Myriad, once collaborated.
</P>
<P>
The partnership was dissolved in acrimonious circumstances in
1994 after Myriad filed for a patent on the other major breast
cancer gene, BRCA1, discovered by Dr Skolnick's team.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the BRCA2 patent dispute will depend, in part,
on which application was filed first. The CRC patent was filed in
November, but Myriad refused to say when it filed its application.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have expressed the hope that the dispute will be
settled by discussion.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Askes Construction Sector To Import Lumber </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Investors engaged in
construction and wood works in Ethiopia have been advised to import
lumber for their production as the forest resources of the country
is being depleted.
</P>
<P>
The advice was made by Hailiye Sahile, Acting General Manager
of the Sawmill and Assemblage Enterprise, in an interview with
the local media.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency today, he said
investors should import lumber because the forest resources in
the country cannot even provide 20 percent of the demand.
</P>
<P>
He suggested the buying of lumber from abroad as the last
option in consideration of the fact that the natural and man-made
forest resources have been irresponsibly depleted, burnt and
illegally sold.
</P>
<P>
He said his enterprise, which produces household and office
furniture, construction materials and various kinds of lumber,
could not satisfy the country's demand for wood products owing to
shortages of raw materials.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he added, his enterprise has sold its products
below target plans in the last three months.
</P>
<P>
There was a total of 27.2 million hectares of forest land in
the esat african country in 1980. However, forest land is reducing
by 75,000 hectares every year since then. enditem

<HEADLINE> UK Witnesses Static Manufacturing in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- British manufacturing output
stagnated in November as firms met weak home-grown and overseas
demand from stockpiles rather than production lines, government
officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Central Statistical Office said that manufacturing output,
the largest component of overall production, remained unchanged in
November compared with October, although it was 0.5 percent higher
than in the same month a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In the three months to November, manufacturing output declined
by 0.1 percent compared with the previous three months, the first
quarterly drop since August 1993.
</P>
<P>
Overall industrial production, which includes the output of the
North Sea and energy production, rose 0.5 percent as demand for
gas and electricity bounced back after October's unusually warm
weather.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the lack of growth in manufacturing in November
reflects not only weaker domestic demand but also the impact of
very high stock levels, built up throughout last year, and a
weakening in exports.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe the slowdown reinforces the case for a further
reduction in interest rates.

<HEADLINE> Somali Faction Fighting Kills 15 Near Kismayo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 12 (Xinhua) -- At least 15 people were
killed and many others wounded on Thursday when a fierce fighting
erupted between militiamen loyal to General Mohamed Said Hirsi
Morgan and those supporting Mr Osman Hassan Ali Atto around the
villages of Yontoy and Gobwein, 18 km and 12 km respectively
north of Kismayo.
</P>
<P>
Radio South Mogadishu supporting Mr Osman Atto quoting a
spokesman for his USC/SNA organization as accusing General
Morgan's militiamen of violating the agreement between the two
sides by launching a massive attack on their militia defense
lines.
</P>
<P>
The radio blamed General Morgan's supporters for
indiscriminately massacring civilians in those villages, while
claiming that the USC/SNA supporters had repulsed the attack by
what they called the aggressors and regained control of the
villages of Yontoy and Gobwein.
</P>
<P>
So far, no comment has been heard from the side of General
Morgan on the three-hour fighting in the Jubba Valley.
</P>
<P>
The radio controlled by Osman Atto said peace dialogue
between the two sides should not be hindered by what they called
a "non-preplanned" incident.
</P>
<P>
A peace meeting is scheduled for January 17 between General
Morgan and the USC/SNA in Kismayo.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 internally displaced families who used to
reside in Yontoy and Gobwein are being stranded in lower Jubba
region without food and shelter.
</P>
<P>
The supporters of General Morgan took control of Yontoy two
days ago, when they chased away militiamen supporting General
Aideed, who set up a base in Yontoy in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Lower Jubba is the second most sensitive region after
Mogadishu. The region has become a battleground for the control
of the port town of Kismayo between supporters of general aideed
and those of General Morgan.
</P>
<P>
Equipped with a port and an international airport, the region
is one of the country's richest for animal husbandry and grain
production.

<HEADLINE> East Germany Debt Not Cause for Germany's Deficit  Exceeding Single Currency Criterion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Germany's soaring budget deficit
last year meant the country would fail to qualify for European
monetary union.
</P>
<P>
 Germany's budget deficit quadrupled from 86.8 billion marks
(61.6 billion U.S. dollars) in 1994 to more than 352 billion
marks (250 billion dollars) in 1995, pushing the deficit to 10.3
per cent of gross domestic production, way above the 3 per cent
limit set by the 1991 Maastricht Treaty for entry into the single
currency system of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
More than a third of the deficit, 123.6 billion marks (87.7
billion dollars), 3.6 percent of (GDP), came from federal
government overspending, the Federal Statistics Bureau reported
today. But 65 per cent of the deficit, or 229 billion marks (162
billion dollars), was accounted for by debt left over from the
former East Germany.
</P>
<P>
Last year the government took over more than 200 billion
marks (142 billion dollars) debt from the German Privatisation
Agency, set up a year ago to carry out the privatisation of East
Germany's state-owned enterprises, and 30 billion marks (21.3
billion dollars) debt left by the former socialist country's
housing departments.
</P>
<P>
So far only Luxemburg, the smallest state among the EU's 15
nations, meets all the criteria for entry into the single currency
system beginning in 1999.

<HEADLINE> OAU Deputy Briefs Freetown On Meeting With RUF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, Jan 12 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African Unity
(OAU) Assistant Secretary General for Political Affairs, Daniel
Antonio, arrived here last night and met Sierra Leonean head of
state, Captain Valentine Strasser, early Friday to brief him on a
meeting between the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and
the OAU in Abidjan last December.
</P>
<P>
According to State House aide Antonio, the mission "is a
follow up to the decision of the OAU central organ which called
on the Secretary General to make all effort to establish and
maintain contact between the Sierra Leone government and the RUF
with a view to initiate dialogue for lasting peace in Sierra
Leone."
</P>
<P>
Efforts after the Abidjan meeting have been centred on "the
pacification and democracy in Sierra Leone, talks between
government and RUF, elections, humanitarian assistance to RUF
controlled areas and ceasefire," the State House source said.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned against any "magic solution to the conflict" from
the on-going OAU mission, but said they are in Sierra Leone to
listen to the government as to how the OAU can help facilitate
the peace process and demicracy.
</P>
<P>
The RUF has assured the OAU that they regard the organization
"as priviledge forum for peace talks," Antonio said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the local radio broadcast quoted Captain Strasser
as saying that "if the RUF decides to hold direct and
unconditional talks" with his government, the government is ready
to "meet them at any time and anywhere."
</P>
<P>
Captain Strasser said the amnesty for RUF combatants who want
to surrender is still on, but regretted that there "has not been
any major breakthrough in the peace process due to the
intransigence of the RUF."
</P>
<P>
The OAU delegation also held talks on Friday with the dean of
the diplomatic corps in Sierra Leone, Ghanaian High Commissioner
(ambassador) Major General Anthony Twumasi, but no details have
been released.

The capital became more peaceful in 1995 despite the general
upsurge in crime rate in most Nigeria's cities.
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Yusufu attributed the decline in crime rate to the
intensification of police patrol teams and the increase in the
number of check-points on the roads and highways in the
territory, amog others. enditem

TOKYO, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
phoned U.S. President Bill Clinton and South Korean President Kim
Young Sam today as he began the first day of his work as Japan's
new head of government, Kyodo News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto first called the White House and told Clinton that he
will try hard to resolve the issue of U.S. military bases in
Okinawa, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
"Maintaining the bilateral security treaty is basic to
Japan-U.S. relations," the 58-year-old premier was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told Hashimoto that he is looking forward to meeting
him when he visits Japan in April, adding that building a personal
relationship is important for the two leaders, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
Ties between Tokyo and Washington have been soured by the rape
of an Okinawan schoolgirl in September last year, for which there
are calls for a reduction in the heavy U.S. military presence in
the southwestern island prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto then called Seoul to tell Kim that he will do his
best to promote the bilateral relationship, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto promised Kim that Japan will keep close contacts with
South Korea in handling issues related to the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
Kim invited Hashimoto to visit South Korea at an early date,
and Hashimoto replied that he would do so, according to Kyodo.
</P>
<P>
As for the issues of the war 50 years ago, Hashimoto said at a
press conference here today that he will never repeat the errors
in history and his attitude is not different from that of his
predecessor Tomiichi Murayama.
</P>
<P>
In the apology he made on August 15 last year, Murayama
admitted that Japan's "colonial rule and aggression caused
tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries,
particularly to those of Asian nations".

<HEADLINE> Indian Economy Shows Strong Signs of Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The general outlook for the
Indian economy remains one of the significant growth of about 5.8
percent in real gross domestic product (GDP) in the current fiscal
year, the Indian National Council of Applied Economic Research
(NCAER) has said.
</P>
<P>
In its latest quarterly analysis of the economy to be published
in its forthcoming margin issue, the council said the signs of
continued high rate of growth in industrial production in the
current financial year from April 1, 1995 are also visible.
</P>
<P>
The high pace of industrial production has also meant rise in
imports, with the imports showing a rise of 32 percent in US
dollar terms during April-September 1995 over the same period in
the previous year, the council said.
</P>
<P>
Exports have also sustained growth in the current fiscal year
registering a growth rate of 26 percent in dollar terms during the
April-September period, it said.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit, as a result of sharper rise in imports
relative to exports, has widened to 2.38 billion dollars during
April-September 1995 as compared to 1.23 billion dollars during
the same period of 1994, the council noted.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the larger trade deficit and slower inflows
of foreign capital began to exert pressures on the exchange rate
by August 1995, leading to depreciation of the rupee from 31.40
rupees per dollar in July to over 35 rupees per dollar in
mid-October 1995.
</P>
<P>
Referring to performance of the agricultural sector, the
council said it is too early to predict the level of food grain
production in 1995-96 keeping in view the delayed onset of Monsoon
and the damage caused by floods during the months of August and
September particularly in the northern parts of the country.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Hi-Tech Industry Developing Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 12 (Xinhua) -- In 1995 the hi-tech industrial
sector of this industrial center in east China reported 55.53
billion yuan worth of output value, an increase of nearly 20
billion yuan over the previous year, according to the municipal
committee for science and technology.
</P>
<P>
A committee official said that the brisk development of the
hi-tech industry was attributed to the full-scale implementation
of the municipal government's strategy of "rejuvenating the city
with science and technology", to the growing investment and the
construction and operation of more foreign-funded hi-tech
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city put a total investment of 1.8 billion yuan
into the development of high technology and new products, embarked
on 306 hi-tech projects, 90 percent of which have reported more
than ten million yuan worth of output value.
</P>
<P>
Having continued to put emphasis on automobiles and modern
telecommunications, local authorities have sought international
cooperation to accelerate the development of computer, biological
and medical industry. The computer sector reported four billion
yuan of output value in 1995, and biological and medical sector
9.6 billion yuan, almost doubling those of 1994.
</P>
<P>
To stimulate the development of hi-tech industry, local
government has worked out a series of preferential policies for
hi-tech enterprises. Local authorities have singled out 412
enterprises as hi-tech ones, 137 of which are located in six
hi-tech industrial development zones. The zones are expected to
yield 100 billion yuan worth of output value by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
At present, the proportion of the hi-tech industry in the whole
city's industry has surpassed ten percent, and the ratio is
estimated to reach 20 percent at the end of the century. The rate
of contribution of science and technology to industry will grow
from 33 to 50 percent.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK's Economy Full of New Hope in 1996 (by Li Huailin) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The year of 1996 for Hong
Kong business circles is full of hope and opportunities as China
enforces its ninth five-year plan, according to a seminar
sponsored by Hong Kong Commercial Daily and Nanyang Commercial
Bank Limited.
</P>
<P>
Henry Tang Ying-yen, chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong
Industries, said that in implementing its ninth five-year plan,
the Chinese Government will adopt many new policies and measures
to maintain its economic growth, which will in turn benefit Hong
Kong's economy.
</P>
<P>
He noted that as China has decided to take favorable
resource-allocating policies toward its west and northwest,
opportunity for Hong Kong businessmen will be further increased.
</P>
<P>
In next five years, China will allocate over one billion yuan
(120.19 million US dollars) each year for technological updating
projects, which will also bring about new chances for Hong Kong
investors, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has announced sharp tariff reductions in 1996 and the
decision will further promote Hong Kong's external trade,
particularly re-export.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, investment flow from China-funded
enterprises into Hong Kong is expected to increase this year.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that despite the fact that China adopted
macro-control policy in the past few years, investment by
China-funded enterprises still rose at an annual rate of 15 to 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
The confidence of the foreign companies was still
high. According to a survey of the American Chamber of Commerce,
more than 70 percent of the American companies which have
subsidiaries or offices in Hong Kong will continue their
operations in Hong Kong after 1997.
</P>
<P>
Shipping capacity between the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong
will increase 25 percent in 1997 when the Beijing-Kowloon Railway
goes into operation.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's property market, one of the pillars for the economy
in the territory, is also seeing recovery in 1996, property
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Land Registry, Hong Kong's property market
improved last month with a number of transactions recording the
biggest month-on-month growth since April 1995.
</P>
<P>
Compared with November 1995, Land transactions in December
increased 32.5 percent to 10,613, and the growth of the property
market rose even higher at more than 46.2 percent over December
1994.
</P>
<P>
Shih Wing Ching, managing director of Centaline Property Agency
Limited, said that Hong Kong people have more confidence in the
property market which almost hit its bottom in the second and
third quarters last year after a fall of 20 percent compared with
the same period in 1994.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, stimulated by banks' interest reduction policy
and the buoyant Hong Kong stock market with Hang Seng Index
standing at over 10,000 points, Hong Kong's property market is
expected to be better in 1996 than previous two years.

<P>
KAMPALA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has impounded
18,000-US-dollars worth of banned Indian pharmacopoeia (IP) drugs
imported by private pharmacies, the local newspaper the New
Vision reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper revealed that the IP drugs, impounded at the Entebbe
international airport, were banned by the National Drug Authority
(NDA) last November.
</P>
<P>
The Indian High Commission in Uganda was quoted as saying that
the IP drug ban was masterminded by the west in a bid to edge
India out of the Ugandan drugs market.

<HEADLINE> Man Wearing Iron Shoes Walks Easily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Before training himself to
walk in a pair of 60-kilogram (132-pound) iron shoes, as heavy as
his own weight, Yuan Guosheng was only an ordinary Chinese
policeman.
</P>
<P>
Now he is known far and wide since his easy walking with heavy
iron shoes was recorded by the Guiness Book of World Records, and
the national China Central Television Station said it was "a
wonder in China" in a popular program last year.
</P>
<P>
Yuan works at Fengying Police Station of Macun District of
Jiaozuo City, in central China's Henan Province. He only intended
to cure vasculities of his right leg, or vein problems, when he
first had an idea to wear iron shoes, Guangzhou's "Yangcheng
Evening News" reported.
</P>
<P>
He had suffered for some time from the disease on his right
leg, although he had sought help in many hospitals since 1990.
</P>
<P>
A doctor advised him to try tying heavy sand bags on his legs,
a traditional way to make legs strong.
</P>
<P>
But Yuan decided to use heavier iron shoes instead.
</P>
<P>
He designed the model of the shoes, welded steel pipes and
plates together and attached rubber on the soles. The finished
shoes, like rubber boots, were 48-centimeters high, weighing 25 kg
each.
</P>
<P>
Yuan's first difficult step in large iron boots attracted
stunned eyes of passers-by on street. His feet and shins were also
rubbed by hard steel, but he kept on exercising.
</P>
<P>
One year later, he could go anywhere wearing the shoes, whether
patrolling on the street, riding a bike or going shopping. If he
had not worn the shoes for several days, the old illness would
have recurred.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, Yuan increased the weight of the shoes to 60 kg, which
enabled him to walk without them as fast as he was used to running
or jogging before. Criminals pursued by Officer Yuan could hardly
escape.
</P>
<P>
Now the iron shoes have not only cured Yuan's disease and
provided more fitness, but also made him well-known. Many
companies have invited him to perform or offer him new jobs with
much more payment since the China Central Television network
broadcast the program about him. But Yuan refused these
opportunities, to stay with his happy lot as a policeman,
physically conditioned by heavy, iron shoes.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a policeman, and I should perform my duty here," he simply
answered.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Headway in Undertaking Overseas Oil Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So far, they are the largest-ever engineering projects China
will have undertaken in other countries through bidding.
</P>
<P>
According to the CPECC President Qin Anmin, the oil storage
stations to be built will have a total handling capacity of over
20 million tons, which constitute one of the key projects for
developing the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Alongside the huge projects, 10 oil pipelines with total length
of more than 270 km will also be laid.
</P>
<P>
Qin said the construction of oil storage stations will start in
July this year and is scheduled to be completed by October 1998,
with a 34-month period of construction. The CPECC will send a
1,500- to 1,800 member-strong construction and management team to
undertake the job.
</P>
<P>
A source from the CPECC said China has made notable progress in
undertaking international oil engineering construction items over
recent years.
</P>
<P>
By now, the CPECC, in charge of the country's overseas oil
engineering construction, has signed contracts with overseas
totalling 800 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
China has become one of the major forces worldwide in terms of
oil engineering construction, which has been increasingly
sharpening its competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
The source said that CPECC, established in 1980, has been
listed among the world's top 225 engineering contractors for the
past two consecutive years, and it now ranks 69th among the top
225 as against the 103rd place last year.
</P>
<P>
Significantly, in the fierce international competitions, China
has won bids for a series of important projects over recent years,
including construction of five large-sized oil and petrochemical
projects in Kuwait involving a total investment of some three
billion U.S. dollars, and construction of five petroleum transport
highways in Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Russia Eager to Develop Trade with Hong Kong, China: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Russia is eagerly expecting
to expand its trade with Hong Kong and, with a permanent office it
hopes to set up here this year, develop a regular trade relation
with China.
</P>
<P>
"I foresee a very good prospect in improving Russia's business
with China and we have many fields to be taken into
consideration," said Valeri Pospelov, member of the Board of
Directors of the Russian Federation Chamber of Commerce and
Industry.
</P>
<P>
Pospelov is leading a Russian trade Delegation on a three-day
visit to Hong Kong, at the invitation of the Hong Kong Trade and
Development Council. The delegation comprises of representatives
from major Russian companies.
</P>
<P>
"Trade can not be done just through imports and exports. Both
Russia and China have quality products with acceptable prices and
a exchange of information and products promotion are needed," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Many Russian companies wish to have joint venture firms set up
in Russia and as we know China and Hong Kong have both shown
interest in this field." Pospelov added.
</P>
<P>
And Russia is planning to establish a permanent exhibition
center in Moscow as a window for Hong Kong-based companies and
their products, he said.
</P>
<P>
Recalling their visit to a joint venture in Dongguan of south
China's Guangdong province yesterday, Pospelov said: "The company
is turning out quality products for export. But why not export
them to Russia?" he said.
</P>
<P>
But he expressed his optimism at forming regular trade
relations with China, rather than the current form based on trade
with goods of equal value. A representative office for the Chamber
is expected to be set up in Hong Kong this year.
</P>
<P>
"The first step of this process may be to authorize a Russian
businessman based in Hong Kong as the Chamber's representative. As
the negotiations are going on, the setting up of a permanent
representative office here is expected later this year," said Igor
Lobanov, Press Attache of the Russian consulate general here.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong and China are subject to most-favored-nation tariff
rates, which average about 13 percent and range from zero up to 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's total exports to Russia during the January-October
period of last year are 240 million US dollars, of which three
percent are domestic exports and the rest re-exports.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong exports to Russia are mainly parts and accessories of
office machines and computers, watches, clocks, clothing and
clothing accessories. And its re-exports to Russia were footwear,
radios, clothing, clothing accessories and TV sets.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong imports aluminum, petroleum oils and semi-conductors
and electronic elements.

<HEADLINE> Technology Makes Construction of Forest Shelter Efficient </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Within nine years, Yulin
Prefecture in northwest China's Shaanxi Province built a 400-km
forest shelter against a desert encroaching upon it. The
prefecture, which is sparsely populated and has financial
problems, attributed the achievement to the adoption of the aerial
sowing technology.
</P>
<P>
The case is just an example of China's strengthening
afforestation with science and technology in its northwest, north
and northeast regions, Pan Yingzhen, an official in charge of the
afforestation in the regions, said.
</P>
<P>
Various localities have attached importance to the use of
technology to save investment and improve economic returns in
building the largest forest shelter in the world, she said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade or so, the administration of the forest
shelter project under the Ministry of Agriculture has spent ten
percent of the total investment spreading forest science and
technology. Technical trainings were offered, and four training
centers built.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 700 applied techniques have been adopted in the shelter
construction, Pan said, which have saved more than 900 million
yuan worth of investment in the second-phase of the project. In
addition, the techniques have played a role in the formation of an
annual output of over six billion kg of fruits in the shelter
regions.
</P>
<P>
The central government planned to invest 1.73 billion yuan in
the second phase of the shelter project, and actually completed
the work with 830 million yuan, according to officials of the
shelter project administration. Apart from the contributions of
localities, science and technology have played a great part, they
said.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President: US Threat Insignificant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Iranian president Hashemi
Rafsanjani today said that the U.S. threat to Iran is
insignificant.
</P>
<P>
In his address to worshippers at the Tehran University campus,
Rafsanjani called on the U.S. government to be more rational as
regards Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said that the recent U.S. budget to destabilize the Islamic
regime was a sign that Washington had failed in its economic
sanctions against Tehran.
</P>
<P>
"I do not see any reason for the U.S. action except
their lack of information about Iran. They were not informed
about Iran before or after the revolution," Rafsanjani said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. has always paid the price of its ignorance of the
Iranian politics," he added.
</P>
<P>
At intervals during the gathering, the worshippers chanted
anti-U.S. slogans, which, however, did not interrupt Rafsanjani
from continuing his speech.
</P>
<P>
Observers here say that the soft tone of Rafsanjani stands in
marked contrast with that parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
They said that Rafsanjani is trying to cool down the growing
tension between the United States and the Islamic Republic by
calling on the U.S. to be more rational on one hand and telling
his citizens that the U.S. threat is insignificant and they
should not resort to radical stands on the other.
</P>
<P>
In this way, they said, Iran could avoid the danger of
potential military confrontation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
However, Nateq-Nouri has called on the parliament to allocate a
special budget to counter the U.S. threats against Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said Thursday that a special budget of 25 billion rials
(about 14.28 million dollars) has been allocated for the next
fiscal year (starting March 21) as a tit-for-tat measure to fight
back a U.S. covert-action bill against the Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
A part of the 25 billion rials special budget will be earmarked
for a lawsuit against Washington in the international court.
</P>
<P>
Local press reported that the special fund will be
distributed to the Foreign Ministry, Information Ministry and
propagation organizations.
</P>
<P>
According to Iranian press, Iran's military forces are on red
alert against potential military confrontation with the U.S.
forces by assigning different contingents to safeguard land and sea
borders.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Beigi, member of Iran's Parliament Defense Commission,
said that the guarding of the southern border and southeastern
border has been assigned to the army. The coastal areas are
assigned to the navy.
</P>
<P>
Beigi said that protection of the western and northwestern
parts of the country are assigned to the Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the security measures taken by the Iranian
government have made it impossible for any "anti-revolutionary
forces" to infiltrate into the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United States has established bases in
some Persian Gulf countries, it is important for Iran to be
more active and take necessary measures to thwart any external
plots.

</P>
<P>
The government's policy on tax and tariffs reduction on
vehicles could be expected this year and it will help boost the
auto market in the country.
</P>
<P>
Major auto manufacturers are moving into Thailand, where they
forecast a growing demand for cars. Major US car companies, like
Ford, Chrysler and General Motors, are undertaking feasibility
studies.
</P>
<P>
According to FTI statistics, a total of 28 auto companies will
open or expand business in Thailand this year and 170 models,
including 22 new ones, will be introduced to the country.
</P>
<P>
Demand for car parts and car-related products, like lubricant
oil, are also expected to rise this year, as more cars need
maintenance, especially after the floods last year.
</P>
<P>
Yet, auto industrialists said that the Finance Ministry's new
regulations on car purchases this year, including a minimum down
payment of 25 percent and more restrictions on leasing, would hurt
public spending on cars.
</P>
<P>
They also noted that a new government proposal requiring buyers
to pay cash for cars which cost over 2 million baht (80,000 US
dollars) each will benefit car makers and will not help solve
traffic congestion in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The proposal made by Thai Deputy Prime Minister Thaksin
Shinawatra is believed to target at easing the country's huge
current-account deficit and serious traffic congestion by curbing
luxury car purchases.
</P>
<P>
However, car dealers and distributors in Thailand contended
that all types of cars, luxury or small ones, may cause traffic
jam, although they favor the motive against the deficit.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the dealers and distributors will face fierce
competition this year. To achieve the sales target of 600,000
units, they have yet to intensify their efforts, including cutting
down their operation costs and introducing more new models.
</P>
<P>
In the second half of last year, the dealers and car leasing
firms had a very hard time as the over-stock situation was widely
seen around the country and the nationwide floods adversely
affected the public's purchasing power.

the small Daghestani village of Pervomaiskoye near Daghestan's
border with Chechnya today, during which both sides insisted on
their initial positions, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which have continued for almost 48 hours with brief
intervals, have not yielded any concrete result yet, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen terrorists, who stormed into the Daghestani city of
Kizlyar and captured over 3,000 hostages early Tuesday and have
continued to hold some 300 hostages at Pervomaiskoye, some 10
kilometers away from the Daghestani-Chechen border, since
Wednesday morning, refuse to release their prey without a
guarantee of their personal safety.

Russian troops and tanks have tightened their siege of the
convoy of 11 buses and two trucks with some 250 terrorists and 300
hostages in the Pervomaiskoye village, reports said.

<HEADLINE> Fujian to Become China's Largest Bamboo Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The northern part of Fujian
Province, east China, has pledged to become the largest bamboo
producer in the country, with the improvement of economic returns
being the core of the plan.
</P>
<P>
Northern Fujian, one of China's major forest and bamboo growing
areas, is home to more than 110 species of bamboo. The region now
has 278,000 ha or 10.5 percent of the country's bamboo groves.
</P>
<P>
The development of bamboo industry will help alleviate the
poverty in rural areas, Lin Kemin, secretary of the Nanping city
Committee of the Communist Party of China, said.
</P>
<P>
Farmers of Gaoping Village, which has a population of 700, used
to live in need. Several years ago, the village introduced the
contract responsibility system concerning the bamboo grove
managment, and its residents began to make bamboo chopsticks, mats
and cushions. According to village head Liu Zhongxiao, his village
turned out more than eight million yuan worth of bamboo products
last year, and the per-capita net income for villagers reached
2,500 yuan.
</P>
<P>
During the past three years, the contract responsibility system
for bamboo groves has been spread across the northern part of
the province, which has helped fire the farmers' enthusiasm in
running bamboo groves. And colleges and universities and research
institutes are involved in the improvement of low-yield bamboo
groves and bamboo byproducts processing.
</P>
<P>
According to the forestry departments of Nanping, the city
reported 1.2 billion yuan worth of output value for the bamboo
industry in 1995, three times that of 1991. Some half of local
farmers' income in bamboo growing areas derived from bamboo.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, northern Fujian will have 330,000 ha
of bamboo groves, which are expected to yield 2.8 billion yuan
worth of output value.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities have worked out a series of policies to
ensure the accomplishment of the goals. According to Liu Dezhang,
director of the provincial forestry department, the policies will
add up over one billion yuan worth of output value for the
northern Fujian region.
</P>
<P>
It is a project which can narrow the disparity between
relatively poor and affluent coastal areas, he said.

will also hold a single country exhibition of Pakistani products
in Tokyo for boosting export.
</P>

Japan is Pakistan's biggest trading partner. During the period
of 1994-95, Pakistan's exports to Japan stood at 542.741 million
dollars and the imports from Japan were 993.362 million dollars.
</P>

<HEADLINE> More Charges Brought Against Chun Doo-hwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean prosecution
today added bribery to charges already brought against former
President Chun Doo-hwan, who has been indicted for violating the
Military Criminal Law.
</P>
<P>
Chun is suspected of having amassed 770 million U.S. dollars in
slush funds during his 1980-1988 presidency and is still holding
some 128 million U.S. dollars, a prosecutor here said.
</P>
<P>
The ex-president was indicted on last December 21 for six
counts of criminal charges, including masterminding the 1979
military mutiny, attempting to kill superior officers and
murdering soldiers on sentry.
</P>
<P>
Arrested on last December 3, Chun is now receiving medical
treatment at the National Police Hospital in Seoul for dehydration
and malnutrition resulting from his three-week-long fast as a
protest against his arrest.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prosecution also indicted five of Chun's
confidants today on charges of helping him accumulate the illicit
funds.
</P>
<P>
Chun's former chief bodyguard Ahn Hyun-tae and former National
Tax Administrator Sung Yong-wook have already been arrested on
graft charges, but former presidential economic aide Sakong Il,
former lawmaker Lee Won-joe and former head of the Agency for
National Security Planning Ahn Moo-hyuk were charged without being
detained.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution said that Chun stashed more money than former
President Roh Tae-woo who was arrested on November 16 of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Roh has been indicted on charges of raising 571 million to 584
million U.S. dollars of slush funds during his 1988-1993
presidency and of violating the Military Criminal Law.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Denies Polluting Euphrates Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has denied an Iraqi
accusation that it is polluting the Euphrates water, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Daily News," a Turkish newspaper, quoted a senior Turkish
diplomat as suggesting that Syria was behind the Iraqi accusation.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said the Iraqi demarche protesting Turkey for
the alleged water pollution, which was presented to the Turkish
embassy in Baghdad recently, reads very similar to a document
given by Syria last month.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat, who remained anonymous, was reportedly in charge
of water files. He claimed that it was possible that Syria
polluted the Euphrates water down-stream.
</P>
<P>
"The primitive irrigation technologies used by Syria are
polluting the water," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement between Syria and Iraq, Syria uses 42
percent of the water which Turkey lets out from the Euphrates and
the remaining 58 percent is used by Iraq, which is further
down-stream.
</P>
<P>
Ankara believes that the Iraqi move was apparently "encouraged"
 by Syria.
</P>
<P>
Damascus has lobbied Arab countries and the west to pressure
Turkey on the water issue. Last December, several Arab foreign
ministers issued a "Damascus Declaration," asking Turkey to
respect Syria's rights over water.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has turned down the water pollution accusation and
refused to regard the Euphrates issue as an element of the
Middle East peace process.

DAR ES SALAAM, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian military
warned the Burundi soldiers against wounding Tanzanians in skirmishes
with rebel groups, saying the Tanzanian armed forces would not
tolerate such incidents for much longer.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania People's Defense Forces commander Robert Mboma
sounded the warning on Thursday during an inspection at Kagunga
near the Burundi border when names of local residents wounded
by Burundi soldiers were handed to him.
</P>
<P>
He met with border residents and inspected the army units
guarding the border.
</P>
<P>
Mboma urged the army units at the border to keep high
vigilance to ensure that Tanzanians are not victims of clashes
occurring on the other side of the border, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Further actions of the Burundi forces on the Tanzanian soil,
intentionally or otherwise, should not be tolerated, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania closed its border with Burundi last year in order to
arrest the deteriorating security situation in the border area.

<P>
MOSCOW -- The group of Chechen terrorists, who are holding some
300 hostages in a small village near the Daghestani-Chechenani
border, agreed Thursday to free all the hostages if Russian troops
open "a corridor" for their safe return to home, according to
reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Daghestani Deputy Interior Minister Gennady
Shpigun tonight as saying that the terrorists "agreed to all
conditions of Russian forces provided that unobstructed entry to
Chechnya is ensured to them."
</P>
<P>
The Chechen militants agreed to release all hostages, "but only
after they are safely back to Chechnya," Shpigun added. Now
Russian troops have made a double circle around the village.
</P>
<P>
The terrorists headed by Salman Raduyev, the son-in-law of
rebel Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev, stormed into the
Daghestani city of Kizlyar early Tuesday morning and captured over
3,000 hostages.
</P>
<P>
ROME -- Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro said on Thursday
he will hold talks on forming a new government following Prime
Minister Lamberto Dini's resignation.
</P>
<P>
A statement from Scalfaro's office said the president has
reserved a decision on Dini's resignation and asked him to stay on
in a caretaker capacity to look after day-to-day business. Dini
announced his second offer of resignation earlier Thursday after a
three-day debate in the Chamber of Deputies (lower house) on the
country's political future showed his one-year-old unelected
government could no longer count on majority support.
</P>
<P>
ZAGREB -- NATO chief said here Thursday that the settlement of
disputes between Croats and Muslims in Mostar is vital to the
implementation of the peace agreement in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, NATO
Secretary General Javier Solana said that he is concerned about
the tension in Mostar and would like it to be resolved as soon as
possible. Solana added that he obtained assurances from Tudjman
that the Croatian side would make every effort to solve the
conflicts in Mostar as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Solana said that his talks with Tudjman focused on the
deployment of IFOR troops and the Eastern Slavonia issue. Solana,
who arrived here today, was travelling to Sarajevo on Friday on a
tour of the former Yugoslav region.
</P>
<P>
ZAGREB -- International police task force have started patrols
in Serb-held suburbs of Sarajevo, a U.N. spokesman said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Alexander Ivanko said in Sarajevo that 117 police of
the U.N. force had now arrived in Bosnia to assist in implementing
the civilian aspects of the Bosnian peace accord. According to
the peace agreement, the international police force will consist
of 1,700 U.N. personnel.
</P>
<P>
Ivanko added that 60 policemen were stationed in Sarajevo and
had already carried out "two or three patrols" in Ilidza, and
other currently Serb-held Sarajevo areas due to revert under
government control within weeks.

<HEADLINE> Heilongjiang-Russia Border Trade Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Border trade between
Heilongjiang Province and its Russian neighbor is rising again
following a downturn trend in recent years, official figures show.
</P>
<P>
Last year trade between the northernmost Chinese province and
the Russian border regions reached 1.65 billion US dollars, up
slightly over the previous year, according to Ji Qingfu, director
of the Heilongjiang Provincial Border Trade Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that this shows that the province's border trade
with Russia has already passed the difficult transitional period
and begun to develop in a healthy and orderly manner.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang, which has a 3,045-km border with Russia, is a
mainstay in Sino-Russian border trade, with the trade volume since
1987 topping eight billion US dollars-worth.
</P>
<P>
However, the path has not always been smooth. Factors connected
with the drive to turn from a planned to a market economy in the
two countries in 1993 dragged down the border trade by 21 percent
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
To turn this situation around, both Chinese and Russian border
trade officials have taken positive measures. As part of its own
efforts, Heilongjiang has reorganized its border trade system by
cutting the number of border trade companies from 8,000 to 638.
</P>
<P>
The province has intensified inspection of export commodities
in a drive to prevent shoddy goods from crossing the border.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the province has also made efforts to improve the
work of its 21 ports of entry already open to Russia.
</P>
<P>
The ways of doing business have also been diversified from
simple barter trade to transactions in cash, economical and
technical co-operation and trade fairs.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Three men convicted of
drug trafficking were hanged at the Selangor Central Prison in
Kajang near the capital early today, Malaysia's news agency
Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted prison department official as
identifying the three men as Mustaffa Kamal Abdul Aziz, 38; Mohd
Radi Abdul Majid, 53; and Foo Yun Fan, 42.
</P>
<P>
They were sentenced to death by the Kuala Lumpur High Court on
May 6, 1988 and March 9, 1991 under section 39 (B) of the
Dangerous Drugs Act 1952.
</P>
<P>
The three men had exhausted all legal processes and avenues of
appeal, the official said in a statement, Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
Mustaffa Kamal and Mohd Radi, both traders, were found guilty
of trafficking drugs weighing 1.18 kg on September 11, 1988, while
Foo, a construction worker, was found guilty of drug trafficking
in 168.49 gm of heroin on August 6, 1984.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court rejected the two traders' appeal on April 7,
1993, and yesterday their lawyer failed in his attempt to get a
stay of execution for the two.
</P>
<P>
Foo's appeal to the Supreme Court was rejected in early March,
1994, Bernama reported.

<P>
HARBIN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- It is a freezingly cold night,
but inside Zou Wancai's gaily-illuminated dance hall, a group of
young men are singing while others are dancing or chatting.
</P>
<P>
Zou's is just one of the 70 karaoke dance halls in Changwu
Township near Zhaodong City in northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province.
</P>
<P>
This winter millions of farmers in the province's 1,100
townships have been enjoying various cultural activities in dance
halls, cinemas and libraries as good as those in cities. These
have mushroomed in recent years with the rise of rural living
standards, according to Qi Jun, an official in charge of the
province's cultural affairs.
</P>
<P>
Last year farmers in the province earned an average of 1,600
yuan (about 192.8 US dollars), 50 yuan more than the nation's
average.
</P>
<P>
Zou's well-furnished dance hall receives more than 20 customers
every night, all local young farmers who spend at least 30 yuan
each.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes some senior villagers also come to join them," Zou's
daughter said.
</P>
<P>
Qi also attributed the local farmers' colorful lives to the
provincial government's efforts to organize entertainment
activities in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
"About 60 opera troupes have toured the countryside and over
150 films reflecting rural life and spreading knowledge of
agricultural science have been showing in the rural areas since
last October," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, performances given by some 1,100 bands formed by
rural families have also helped enrich local farmers' lives.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yan, 58, of Changwu Township, who formed a family band
together with his three sons and one daughter a few years ago, is
invited to give performances every night at local dance halls,
</P>
<P>
They play musical instruments such as trumpet, saxophone and
drum and sing popular and folk songs.
</P>
<P>
Members of a farmers' suona horn band in Wujiazi Township has
been invited to play by the provincial TV station.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers, who used to be left idle during the winter
season, have begun to turn to reading and writing novels,
painting, photography, paper cutting and other forms of cultural
pastimes.
</P>
<P>
They have formed 38 cultural groups, and over 700 of their
works have been exhibited in Beijing, 100 of which have won prizes
both at home and abroad.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Finance Minister
Musalia Mudavadi has reaffirmed the government's commitment to
privatisation of Kenyan enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Thursday at a signing ceremony of the sale of the
Kenya Airways' 26 percent of shares to a Dutch airline,the KLM,
Mudavadi said the government plans to privatise more parastatals
during 1996 and to complete the privatisation of the remaining
parastatals by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Airways will float its shares to the public at the
Nairobi Stock Exchange,he said.
</P>
<P>
Local institutional investors will be invited to take up to 20
percent of the capital, while 10 percent of the shares will be
reserved for the employees of the airlines, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Between 30 and 35 shares will be offered through a public

<HEADLINE> Removal of Thai Deputy Finance Minister Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 12 (Xinhua) -- An adviser to Thai Prime
Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa has urged the government to remove
Deputy Finance Minister Newin Chidchob from his post to improve
the government's image.
</P>
<P>
The adviser, Metha Ua-apinyakul, said, "The removal of some
ministers, such as Mr. Newin, would improve the Government's image
and win back the public's faith."
</P>
<P>
Metha's remarks are surprising because both he and Newin belong
to the same faction, the Therd Thai faction, of the prime
minister's Chart Thai (Thai Nation) party.
</P>
<P>
Newin's name has been linked to an 11.4 million baht (456,000
US dollars) vote-buying scandal during the campaign for the July 2
general election of 1995.
</P>
<P>
It has been speculated that during a government reshuffle,
which may take place before parliament reconvenes in March, a
deputy foreign minister and a deputy labor and social welfare
minister will be added to the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
However, Metha said there should also be changes in the Finance
Ministry, because its minister Surakiat Sathirathai and deputy
ministers, in particular Newin, are not acceptable to the public.
</P>
<P>
Newin, who was accused of buying votes in the last general
election but not charged, was ranked the most unpopular cabinet
minister in recent opinion surveys.
</P>
<P>
Surakiat, who was a law adviser to Banharn before the general
election, has been criticized for being inexperienced and
unqualified for his post and blamed for nearly all the economic
blunders since the six-party coalition government took office last
July.

<HEADLINE> China, Denmark Sign Environmental Co-operation Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- China and Denmark will conduct
widespread environmental co-operation, according to an agreement
signed here today.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the two countries will put emphasis on
co-operation in areas including energy sources, hazardous waste
management, cleaner production, institutional management, solid
waste management, waste water management, oil spill contingency
planning, research on air pollution by the transport sector, and
the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
The co-operation activities will include exchanges of
information and publications on environmental protection,
environmental scientists, and of experts and environmental
management personnel. They will jointly conduct pilot projects,
symposiums, seminars, lectures and training courses, and research
on subjects of mutual interest.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua, head of China's National Environmental Protection
Agency, told Svend Auken, Danish minister of environment and
energy that China has always attached importance to global
environmental issues and hopes to solve global environmental
problems through co-operation with countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
China started environmental co-operation with Denmark in the
1980s. In 1987 China built a pilot sewage treatment project in
Handan city in north China's Hebei Province with government loans
from Denmark. At present, the technique has been spread to more
than a dozen places in the country. The Beijing Brewery has
succeeded in adopting a Danish technique for waste water treatment.
</P>
<P>
The two countries decided to jointly build a pilot thermal
power project in China when Xie Zhenhua visited Denmark in
1995. The project is expected to be built in Shuangyashan City in
northeast China's Heilongjiang Province. Feasibility studies are
now under way.

<HEADLINE> NZ Industries Emit More Carbon Dioxide into Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Carbon dioxide emitted by
New Zealand industries rose about 7 percent from 1990 to 1994,
shows a Commerce Ministry report.
</P>
<P>
The report says NZ energy sources poured 27.4 million tons of
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in 1994, up by nearly two
million tons since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Downplaying the gas emissions, Energy Minister Doug Kidd was
quoted by a local press report today as saying that the report had
considered only gross emissions, and it was net emissions that
contributed to the greenhouse effect.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the government's target was to return net
emissions to their 1990 level by 2000 through tree planting
schemes to absorb the carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
But the environmental group Greenpeace was not convinced. The
movement's energy spokeswoman Kirsty Hamilton said the NZ
government was nearly alone internationally in thinking it could
meet required reduction targets by planting trees.
</P>
<P>
"You have to deal with the source of the problem," she said.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that about 90 percent of emissions were
produced by the energy sector, notably domestic transport.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Keen to Lure Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province, the country's biggest heavy industrial base, plans to
open more channels for overseas investment in the technological
reform of local industrial enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The province has 26,000 enterprises, among which 1,375 are
large and medium-sized ones, accounting for one-tenth of the
country's total. The fixed assets of the large and medium-sized
enterprises are worth 150 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Wen Shizhen, governor of the province, noted at a work
conference concerning opening-up that the province would focus its
attention on optimizing the industrial structure and improving the
economic performance of the enterprises, while using overseas
investment.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year the province plans to sign at least 100
contracts, each with more than five million US dollars of
investment.
</P>
<P>
The province expects to have two-thirds of its large and
medium-sized enterprises technologically reformed by the end of
this century.
</P>
<P>
In order to reach this goal the province will open more
channels for overseas investments, as well as co-operation with
international finance.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors will be permitted to contract and lease 10
to 15 state large and medium-sized enterprises, and experiments
in exchange of technology and capital through shareholding will be
conducted.
</P>
<P>
The province will also take measures to send delegations abroad
offering co-operation projects for overseas investment.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Imported Fruits Storm Ugandan Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The economic development and
political stability have taken Ugandan's business acumen to a
different level in recent years.
</P>
<P>
An obvious change is that imported fruits from the temperate
countries across the high seas and oceans now can be seen on the
open markets in Kampala. Apples, grapes, dates, broccoli,
asparagus, chines cabbages, almonds and pistachio are all here
and fresh.
</P>
<P>
Most of these fruits and vegetables are imported from France,
Israel and South Africa by Kenyan dealers.
</P>
<P>
The fruits are reportedly preserved under refrigeration
facilities in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya from where Ugandan
dealers purchase them and bring them to Uganda.
</P>
<P>
On the market stalls here, a kilogram of apple from France
known as "the golden delicious yellow" goes for 4,000 Uganda
Shillings (about one US dollar), orange from israel with the
label "jaffa" are also sold at 4,000 shillings a kilogram.
</P>
<P>
While grapes from South Africa fetch 10,000 shillings for a
kilogram, coconuts are sold at 1,500 shillings and apples at
3,500 shillings per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Apples and coconuts are also sold in pieces and the prices
range from 500 to 700 shillings for a piece of apple and 600 to
700 shillings for a piece of coconut.
</P>
<P>
Suwedi Tebandeke, one of the Ugandan dealers to engage in
business in fruits at Nakasero market in the centre of the city,
travels to Nairobi every fortnight to purchase apples,
pears,oranges and grapes.
</P>
<P>
He purchases 20 boxes containing 135 frozen fruits each and
gets them loaded on a bus that very evening.
</P>
<P>
The dealer said the 10 hour-journey for Nairobi to the Ugandan
border does not harm his groceries because they are by then still
ice cold.
</P>
<P>
Problem came when the tax-men at the Ugandan boder caused
delays in releasing the goods to their final destination.
</P>
<P>
Tebandeke was unwilling to disclose how much per kilogram of
fruits he purchased from Kenyan dealers, but he only said that
the taxes charged on each kilogram of fruit is 500 shillings.
</P>
<P>
Tebandeke has been importing the fruits since the begining of
1995. He said: "Business is good because i can sell five or eight
killograms of imported fruits a day at my Nakasero market stall,"
adding that sales are high towards, especially during the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
He craked a smile and mentioned that at first the customers
were mostly white but of late indigenous Ugandans started buying
the fruits.
</P>
<P>
At set of sun, the Nakasero market vendors have to take their
imported fruits to a refrigrated store, a block away where they
pay 200 shillings per box of fruit per night.
</P>
<P>
Althouth imported fruits have been storming the makets in
Uganda, the local fruits are sold in mounds. Talk of the locally
fruits, an apple charges 600 shillings and 500 for a pear.
</P>
<P>
The only problem is that many people do not know these
imported fruits, but is is belived that some time or other the
locals will get to know.

<HEADLINE> Some 1,200 Tons of Beer Poured Down Drain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A local brewery has poured
1,214 tons of substandard beer down the drain after taking over
another brewing company.
</P>
<P>
The Yanjing Brewery Group, the top beer manufacturer in the
Chinese capital, dumped the beer worth 1.457 million yuan (about
173,452 US dollars) as well as some deteriorated raw materials for
producing beer when it took over the Huashi Brewing Group.
</P>
<P>
The Huashi firm, located in Shunyi County in northern Beijing,
used to produced 70,000 tons of beer annually. But due to
mismanagement and low market share, it had a deficit of 39.21
million yuan and could not go on with its operations.
</P>
<P>
When the Yanjing company learned about this and conducted a
feasibility study, it decided to annex its counterpart, which
represented the first ever merger between two manufacturing groups
in the city.
</P>
<P>
Since Yanjing is a famous brand not only in Beijing but in the
country as a whole, the company deemed the 1,214 tons of beer left
over by the Huashi firm did not match its quality standard and
thus decided to dump it.

<HEADLINE> New Policy to Be Implemented For Border Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is
drawing up a new policy for border trade.
</P>
<P>
The new policy will include measures such as continuing to
exercise preferential policies for such trade, in accordance with
the principles of the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
The new policy will make China's border trade healthy, stable
and orderly, and enable it to gradually conform to the common
practice in the world, a trade specialist said here today.
</P>
<P>
He added that the improved trade order along the border will
also play an important role in bringing prosperity to border areas
and developing friendly co-operation with neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The specialist defined the border trade as that along the
border regions rather than that in the border provinces. In the
1980s and early 1990s China exercised preferential trade policies
in Heilongjiang and Yunnan provinces, and the Inner Mongolia,
Xinjiang Uygur and Guangxi Zhuang autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of the local economic and trade
commissions, departments of border defense, customs, public
security and taxation should all be involved in the management of
the markets established exclusively for bargaining by border
residents, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Preferential policies such as taxation reduction should be
carried out for the trade to revitalize the economies and increase
the revenues of the border regions, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that commodities exchanged in small-scale trade should
originate in the border regions.
</P>
<P>
An overall plan should be drafted for the border trade, with
the joint efforts of central and local governments, as well as the
involvement of departments of finance, credit and insurance, the
specialist said, adding that relevant departments should
strengthen inspection of the trade and perfect the equipment of
border ports to gradually standardize the border trade. The
quality and structure of the trade goods should be improved, and
the trading methods and concepts should be upgraded, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Jiangsu Province in east China
has achieved its initial goal in eliminating illiteracy over the
past five years, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to a local education official, some 1.77 million
local people under 45 who were unable to read and write have
become literate since 1990, 270,000 more than the target.
</P>
<P>
So far, over 95 percent of local people under 45 have become
literate, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government vowed five years ago to reduce its
11.6 million figure for illiterates to less than 10 million in the
1991-1995 period.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the province has spent 118 million yuan (about 14.2
million US dollars) on eliminating illiteracy, especially among
people in rural areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official also attributed the success to the efforts of some
8,000 teachers who have been working in 1,000 literacy schools in
the province's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show that China now has 150 million
people above the age of 15 who are illiterate or semi-illiterate.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years China has eliminated illiteracy at an
annual rate of over four million cases, most of whom were under
the age of 45.

YANGON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A Myanmar leader on Thursday
extended welcome to the remaining armed groups in the country
after the surrender of drug warlord Khun Sa's Mong Tai Army (MTA)
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The New Light of Myanmar newspaper today quoted Tin Oo, second
secretary of the Myanmar State Law and Order Restoration Council
and chief-of-staff of the army, as saying at a meeting here that
members of the MTA under the command of Khun Sa in Homong and
Loilam areas, Shan state, gave up their arms and turned themselves
in to the government troops on January 5.
</P>
<P>
He said that the MTA members realized that there was no benefit
for them to fight against the nation but there was only loss for
both the country and the world by their drug-trafficking.
</P>
<P>
A total of 4,431 MTA men had returned to the legal fold with
arms and ammunition of 3,483 items, Tin Oo said.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The pilot reform city of
Shenzhen has launched a massive campaign to eliminate mice.
Citizens who catch mice will be rewarded.
</P>
<P>
According to the Shanghai-based Xinmin Evening News, the local
government has promised to offer five yuan (about 60 cents or 60
percent of a US dollar) to local residents who capture one mouse.
</P>
<P>
Recently, mice have provoked a series of accidents for the
city, which is located in the fast growing Guangdong Province in
South China and borders Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, a mouse jumped into a main switch and caused a
residential area-wide electrical short for a few hours while
another mouse's death led to a short-circuit which almost exploded
an oil depot.
</P>
<P>
And the third mouse chewed and damaged an advanced medical
apparatus which was worth one million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Experts said as the weather is turning cold in winter, the mice
tend to be active in the wild and indoors. This is also a good
time to seize and wipe out the mice, they said.
</P>
<P>
The anti-mice event, which coincides with the traditional
Chinese "Mouse Year" of 1996, started January 3 and ended
Thursday.

topographical maps of border sections endorsed by both sides.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony here was attended by Zhang Deguang, vice foreign

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Congress Speeds Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 12 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province, in the vanguard of China's opening-up drive, is
safeguarding the healthy development of its economic construction
by speeding up local legislation.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee of the provincial People's Congress has
made and approved 184 sets of regulations since China's opening-up
drive started in 1978, of which about 100 were made in the past
five years.
</P>
<P>
Over half of the regulations are economy-related. Some of them
are said to be so creative that they provide valuable references
for the enactment of state-level laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
Since 1978 Guangdong's economy has developed by leaps and
bounds. But its legislation, lagging behind the social development
of the province, has become a hindrance to the smooth growth of
Guangdong's economy.
</P>
<P>
Before the approval of the Corporation Law and amendments to
the Trial Enterprise Bankruptcy Law being made by the state, the
Commission for Legal Affairs of the provincial People's Congress
organized the drafting of the Regulations on Corporations in
Guangdong and the Regulations on the Bankruptcy of Corporations in
Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
The two regulations specifically define the setting up,
organizing, business activities and bankruptcy procedures of
companies.
</P>
<P>
In promoting local legislation, the Standing Committee of the
provincial People's Congress not only supplies the administrative
organs with a legal basis, but also prevents certain departments
from overstepping their powers, which is harmful to economic
growth, by means of legislation.
</P>
<P>
Among regulations approved within the past three years, one
fourth of them are experimental to some extent.
</P>
<P>
For instance, in 1993, the province drew up special regulations
to crack down on usury in the Pearl River Delta, which proved to
be effective and set a precedent for other provinces.
</P>
<P>
In its legislative work, Guangdong gives priority to the making
of economic laws, as well as laws closely linked with the market
economy, including laws to promote democracy, safeguard citizens'
rights and interests and protect the environment.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Whitewashes St Vincent and Grenadines at Gold Cup </HEADLINE>

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Mexico whitewashed minnow St
Vincent and the Grenadines 5-0 in a Group A match of the CONCACAF
Gold Cup soccer tournament on Thursday in San Diego, United
States.
</P>
<P>
Both Luis Garcia and Ricardo Pelaez scored two goals apiece for
the Mexican squad while Agystin Garcia hit a single one.
</P>
<P>
Though the team gain the big-margin victory, the Mexican fans
didn't show their satisfaction, either over the squad nor over
the head coach Bora Milutinovic, the former U.S. national team
coach in the 1994 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic was under heavy pressure as Mexico has won just one
of four matches under him, who led Mexico to the 1986
World Cup quarter-finals, but has suffered losses to Yugoslavia
and Slovenia's Under 23 team in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Mexico dominated the first half, pinning its rival in their own
half and rarely permitting them past the midfield line.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's effort finally paid off in the 29th minute through
Luis Garcia, who also contributed the second goal eight minutes
later, making his squad leading 2-0 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
Pelaez also scored two goals in the 70th and 90th minute
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Agustin Garcia added one goal in the 80th minute.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing International Science Exchanges Brisk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Over the past five years this
major city in inland Sichuan Province has carried out 12
intergovernmental agreements on science and technology
co-operation, involving 150 foreign science workers and
economists, and 290 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing has had 370,000 science workers who carried out
international co-operation in science and technology with the
treatment of urban transportation and environmental pollution in
the past few years.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 the governments of China and Japan signed an agreement
on the improvement of the city's transportation, and listed it in
the governmental fiscal budget. Having sent experts to conduct
feasibility studies three times in 1994, the Japanese government
listed the program in the fourth batch of Japanese yen loans,
which totalled 20 billion yen.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem of serious pollution, the local
authorities managed to have the issue included in a Sino-British
science and technology cooperation plan twice. Last year, the city
acquired some five million US dollars worth of World Bank loans
for the research of air and river pollution treatment. Thanks to
the efforts, the city now leads the country in water pollution
studies.
</P>
<P>
A number of technical problems in the city's major state-run
enterprises have been tackled through international
co-operation. The Jialing Group, a major motorcycle production
base in China, invited German experts to participate in its engine
and model design and management.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chongqing held a business fair in San Francisco in
the United States for the first time, featuring science and
technology projects. Several hundred local businessmen from the
sectors of science and technology, finance and commerce attended
the fair, which concluded with a business volume of 190 million US
dollars.

<HEADLINE> "Tibet to Be Self-Sufficient in Grain by 2000" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region aims
to be self-sufficient in grain by the end of this century,
according to Yang Song, vice-chairman of the regional government.
</P>
<P>
To meet the target the region will have to increase its annual
grain production to one billion kg from 700 million kg in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The regional government plans to increase the total annual
grain production of Gonggar, Lhunzhub, Lhaze, Gyangze, Bainang
counties and Xigaze City to 350 million kg in five years, Yang
said.
</P>
<P>
The six grain-producing centers' current total annual
production is 210 million kg, he added, explaining that the
centers are located in the Three Rivers (the Yarlung Zangbo,
Nyangqu and Lhasa rivers) Valley.
</P>
<P>
The central government will invest 1.3 billion yuan in the area
during the 1996-2000 period, six times the amount invested during
the 1991-1995 period.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years the central government has spent some
250 million yuan undertaking 42 grain-production projects in the
centers, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
So far, 15 water-control projects involving a total investment
of 90 million yuan are being undertaken in this region. As a
result, a number of reservoirs, pumping stations and irrigation
canals have been completed, increasing the irrigated area by some
15,000 ha.
</P>
<P>
Some 7,300 ha of low-yield farmland have been upgraded at a
total cost of nearly six million yuan. The regional government has
also spent 10 million yuan building agro-technique pilot zones and
expanding agro-technique propagation stations in the five
counties, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that over the next five years Tibet will ungrade the
Regional Agro-Technique Propagation Center, the nine
agro-technique stations at the county level and 181 such stations
at the township level and increase the number of technicians to
1,800, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
He added that in the next five years 40 percent of Tibetan
farmers will attend annual agro-technology training courses.

<HEADLINE> hke-- Snowstorm Helps Reduce Crime in Eastern US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The blizzard that paralyzed
eastern U.S. for two days lent an unintended helping hand to the
police, reducing murders and other crimes in many cities,
authorities said today.
</P>
<P>
Police from Boston to Washington reported drops in almost all
categories of crime since Sunday's snow storm, an Associated Press
report said.
</P>
<P>
"We're thankful for any help we can get from God or man in our
fight to reduce crime," said Richard Neal, police commissioner of
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia, which averages 1.2 murders a day, enjoyed a
60-hour a murder-free time during the time of the storm that
buried the city with record 30 inches of snow.
</P>
<P>
New York City, which averaged about three murders a day in
1995, also waited three days before the killing resumed. Reports
of robberies, burglaries, car thefts and other serious crimes in
the city also went down.
</P>
<P>
But killing resumed as life returned to normal after the
blizzard roared to sea. Four men were shot to death from 11:30
p.m. Wednesday and 9:20 a.m. Thursday in the city's streets.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, violent crime also dropped 14 percent last
weekend. In Baltimore, serious crimes went down by 23 percent in
the first 10 days of January.
</P>
<P>
In Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where 28 inches of snow fell,
there had been no burglaries since Sunday, the Associated Press
said. In York, a city near Harrisburg, there were no reports of no
muggings or car thefts.
</P>
<P>
"Who knows? Maybe nature can teach people the senselessness of
pitting man against man," said Neal.
</P>
<P>
But Randy King, a Harrisburg police spokesman, said
"Everybody's too tired from shoveling. They don't have time to
create mayhem."

<HEADLINE> German Export to Asia Increases Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 11 (Xinhua) -- German exports to Asia rose to 55
billion marks (about 39 billion U.S. dollars) in 1995 and the
trend is expected to continue this year.
</P>
<P>
The German Economic Research Institute said that German exports
to Asian countries were up 80 percent in 1995 over 1990, and its
exports to Malaysia, Thailand and China were more than doubled in
the past six years, while imports rose by 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
The increase was mainly attributed to the rapid economic growth
in Asian countries, which enjoyed a 10 percent annual increase in
recent years, and the appreciation of the Japanese yen which
affected Japanese exports.
</P>
<P>
In Asia, China is the largest buyer of German products,
followed by South Korea, a report of the research institute said.

COLOMBO, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's capital Colombo has
been placed on "Red Alert" following intelligence reports that
Tamil rebels were planning to explode several bombs simultaneously
in vital places, police sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that this intelligence had come to light
following the recovery of a large cache of arms and ammunition in
the suburbs of Colombo a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe that these arms and ammunition were to be
used to blow up the Kelani Bridge (the gateway to Colombo),
television and broadcasting stations, and military and police
installations.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said valuable information has been obtained from
10 male and one female suspects who were arrested when the arms

Most of the primary schools that have fewer than 120 school

of more than 10,000.

<HEADLINE> Peru to Play Active Role in Andean Pact, Says President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori said here Thursday night that his country is optimistic
about the future of the Andean Pact after its re-entry into the
Latin American organization.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori arrived here Thursday on a three-day official visit
to Venezuela, his first abroad this year.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera, Fujimori
said that Peru's re-entry into the Andean Pact and the start of
free trade among the member nations indicate the consolidation of
the Andean Pact and the political will of Peru to continue to
support the pact as a full member.
</P>
<P>
The Andean Pact groups five Latin American countries of
Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela. Peru requested
suspension of its membership in 1992 because of differences on
tariffs with other member states. It resumed its full membership
two years later.
</P>
<P>
According to Fujimori, Peru will play an active role in the
free trade zone and will continue bilateral negotiations for
harmonious economic development with all member states of the
Andean Group.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian president said his country will preserve the peace
agreements and oppose arms race in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The resources spent to buy weapons should be directed to social
development and the peace of all the peoples, he added.

<HEADLINE> Chamorro's Son-in-Law Announces Candidacy to Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- President Chamorro's son-in-law
and leader of the "Proyecto Nacional" political movement today
announced he would run for president in the October general
elections.
</P>
<P>
Antonio Lacayo, a former Nicaraguan minister, is challenging
the electoral rules of the reformed political constitution, which
ban relatives of the current president, Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro, from running for office.
</P>
<P>
The "Proyecto Nacional" leader said that he is a firm contender
for the presidency of the country, despite the constitutional ban.
</P>
<P>
He said, "I know that what I am intending to do is not easy,"
but added he is not a person who gives up his ideas easily and he
does not retreat in the face of challenges and difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Several of Mrs Chamorro's cabinet ministers have filed
injunctions with the Supreme Electoral Court against the new
constitution.
</P>
<P>
The legitimacy of Lacayo's candidacy will depend on the outcome
of the court's decision, expected later this month.
</P>
<P>
Lacayo said he will abide by the Supreme Court's decision
and dismissed the possibility of calling a civil protests if the
decision goes against him.
</P>
<P>
President of the Supreme Court Orlando Trejos said magistrates
will decide on constitutional bans this month, so as not to affect
the electoral process.

<HEADLINE> Italian President to Hold Talks after PM Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME. January 11 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro said on Thursday he will hold talks on forming a new
government following Prime Minister Lamberto Dini's resignation.
</P>
<P>
A statement from Scalfaro's office said the president has
reserved a decision on Dini's resignation and asked him to stay on
in a caretaker capacity to look after day-to-day business.
</P>
<P>
Dini announced his second offer of resignation earlier Thursday
after a three-day debate in the Chamber of Deputies (lower house)
on the country's political future showed his one-year-old
unelected government could no longer count on majority support.
</P>
<P>
His resignation headed off a resolution inviting him to resign
put by media magnate Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right Freedom
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Dini first offered his resignation on December 30 as promised
after his technocrat government fulfilled its four major tasks,
including pension reform and budget cuts. But President Scalfaro
rejected his offer, insisting that parliament decide the fate of
the government.
</P>
<P>
Parties and organizations of the center, left and right in the
Chamber of Deputies remained deeply divided Thursday on whether
Dini's government should stay or go. Instead, they proposed eight
draft bills including one demanding an immediate reform of the
country's constitutional system.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed here that the resignation of Dini's
government will cast a shadow over Italy's six month presidency of
the European Union in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro said he would start consultations next Monday with
political leaders including former President Francesco Cossigas,
speakers of both houses of parliament and party heads on forming a
new government.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said failure to form a cross-party government
would probably mean an early general election, three years ahead
of schedule. Italy has been without elected government since
Berlusconi was forced to resign as prime minister in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
Dini remains in the running to lead the next government. But he
said he did not expect to be re-appointed.
</P>
<P>
However, parliamentary sources said they did not rule out the
possibility that Scalfaro turns to Dini again.

<HEADLINE> Australia Eyes European Regulations on Data Flow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- As European nations are using
privacy laws as the stick to rule the wild information
superhighway, Australia is under pressure to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
Australia would risk being excluded from European information
flows if it failed to update its own laws before European Union
members tighten control over cross-border transmission of
confidential data related to individuals by mid-998, today's
Australian Financial Review reported.
</P>
<P>
Advanced telecommunication technology has made data flows
across borders of countries grow at an unprecedented speed.
Government control of data flows on electronic information
networks is basically unpractical. For example, tracing the
information on the Internet is as difficult as tracing the path of
a water droplet in the oceans.
</P>
<P>
The European Union members have adopted strict privacy laws on
how people should conduct themselves on electronic information
networks. The criteria include the protection of sensitive
commercial information of individuals and companies.
</P>
<P>
It is hard for the privacy authorities to catch every offender
who transfers illegal data on information networks. But a few
examples of crackdown on major offenses will deter potential
wrong-doers.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the European Union Council of Ministers has
decided to adopt a Personal Data Protection Directive to prohibit
data export to countries without "adequate" privacy laws. The
directive will come into force by mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
This will have a major impact on Australia, whose patchy
federal privacy act does not come in line with European standards,
the newspaper quoted a leading Australian privacy official as
saying.
</P>
<P>
If Australia failed to tighten its privacy laws on European
standards, it might not be able to get necessary commercial
information from European companies that run business in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
It could disrupt the flow of European personal financial
details to companies in Australia, impede efforts to identify
European shareholders in Australian companies, hamper the
operation of data-processing bureaus and complicate the transfer
of European social security details, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
If this happened, Australia would lose its attractiveness as an
investment destiny in the Asia-Pacific region for European
companies.
</P>
<P>
The Australia Federal Government is considering adopting
legislation similar to the comprehensive privacy law that New
Zealand put into force two years ago.
</P>
<P>
State governments such as Queensland and New South Wales are
also on the way to introduce legislation on privacy laws.

<HEADLINE> Economic Growth Slows Down in Germany in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Germany's gross domestic product
rose by 1.9 percent in 1995 as compared with 2.9 percent in the
previous year, according to an official report released today.
</P>
<P>
The report released by Johann Hahlen, president of the Federal
Statistics Bureau, in Wiesbaden said that Germany recorded a GDP
of 3.46 trillion German marks (about 242 trillion U.S. dollars) in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Both the east and the west were affected by the economic
slowdown. The west registered a growth rate of 1.5 percent in
1995, lower than the 2.4 percent in 1994, while in the east that
rate dropped from 8.5 percent to 6.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Construction, among those most severely bombarded, gained a
depressing 1.9 percent in 1995 against 7.8 percent in 1994. Other
indexes including equipment investment and private consumption
recorded just a slender increase, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Trade presented a comparatively good performance but still was
not satisfactory. Due to a German mark appreciation, exports and
imports grew by 3.7 percent and 3.1 percent respectively in 1995,
as opposed to 7.5 percent and 7.1 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt expressed
disappointment over the slowdown, saying the growth was far lower
than expected.
</P>
<P>
The appreciation of the mark, high pay and heavy taxes are the
brake restricting the economy, he suggested and warned that
growing unemployment will also be a big problem for 1996.

<HEADLINE> Peru's Trade Deficit to Surpass $2 Billion in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Peru's trade deficit in 1995 is
expected to top 2 billion U.S. dollars as imports soared and
exports fell.
</P>
<P>
Peru's trade deficit stood at 2 billion dollars in the first
11 months of 1995, but was likely to exceed the 2 billion mark for
the year due to a surge in imports in the run up to Christmas,
said a report from Peru's National Customs Superintendency.
</P>
<P>
Between January and November, Peru's exports reached 4.9
billion dollars, while imports soared 43 percent to 6.97 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Imports of raw materials and semi-finished products rose 32.8
percent, consumer goods 23.9 percent, and capital goods and
building materials 14.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> China to Take More Measures to Intensify Coal Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- China plans to make full use of
its bulky coal resources while intensifying coal production, with
priority being given to the development of pit-head power plants,
exploitation of coalbed methane gas and association minerals, and
utilization of shaped coal and coal-water mixture, today's China
Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Zhongqi, president of the China Coal
Utilization and Energy Conservation Corp, foreign investments are
forthcoming for the development of coal resources, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
For example, Germany companies are negotiating with the Taiyuan
Coal Gasification Corp on setting up a coking plant and a heat and
power plant, while a Sino-Japanese venture will be set up for the
production of briquet for industrial use and active carbon, the
English-language newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The country will also launch several projects this year on the
development of kaolin earth, a material used in papermaking and
the ceramic industry, it said.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on a methane exploitation project in Chongqing in
southwest China is being carried out with James R. Clements of the
US, aiming at offering 100 million cu m of methane gas as fuel to
small power plants nearby and residents in the city, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
China's reserves of coalbed methane gas totals around 35
trillion cu m, but only 400 million is used each year, it said.

HAIKOU, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Export-Import Bank of Japan
will extend loans worth 2.4 billion US dollars for 30 Chinese
projects, according to meeting held here on the first batch of
loans by the bank.
</P>
<P>
Agreements on the projects to be financed by the loans will be
signed separately in January, February and March this year.
</P>
<P>
A source at the meeting said that the loans carry low interest
rates and a maturity of up to 23 years, and there will be few
restrictions on the use of the loans.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese bank is a government institution that established
co-operative relations with China in 1979. Many of the loans
granted by the bank to China since then have been directed to the
energy sector.

<HEADLINE> China to Open Retail Markets Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua)-- China will open its retail
markets further to the outside world by inviting more overseas
investors for the consumer and capital goods trade.
</P>
<P>
The English-language paper China Daily quoted Chen Bangzhu,
minister of internal trade, as saying that the move is aimed at
introducing more foreign capital, technology and market management
skills to overhaul China's commodity distribution system in the
last five years of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
Invigorating China's commodity circulation sector has been
listed as one of the seven major tasks during the Ninth Five-Year
Plan period (1996-2000), which is a key period for the country's
economic growth and social development, as well as for the reform
of the nation's commodity distribution system and the development
of the domestic markets.
</P>
<P>
The minister also indicated that the experience in running
Sino-overseas retail ventures and co-operative retail firms will
be summarized and expanded in more cities.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Internal Trade will start pilot experiments in
running Sino-overseas ventures and co-operation firms dealing in
capital goods after opening up the retail market.
</P>
<P>
China will make new efforts toward introducing advanced foreign
distribution technology and ways of management, and channel
overseas investment into areas of business automation, in-depth
processing and packaging of products, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
China will try to give more domestic commercial firms with the
right of import and export to encourage the domestic market sector
to compete in the international market.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the ministry show 206 commercial firms have won
the right to operate independent import and export businesses.
</P>
<P>
China launched experiments in opening the retail market in
1992, and 14 Sino-overseas department stores have since been
licensed to operate in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou,
Qingdao, Dalian and the five special economic zones.

<HEADLINE> Poland's 1996 Budget Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Polish parliament approved
the government's 1996 budget tonight, setting a target for 5.5 per
cent growth in gross domestic product, a further fall in inflation
from 23 to 17 per cent, a budget deficit of 9.5 billion zloty (3.8
billion U.S. dollars) and average salary increases of 5.5 per cent.
</P>
<P>
Poland's economy is recovering after growth fell in the late
1980s and early 1990s and inflation soared to as high as 1,000 per
cent as the country carried out ambitious market-oriented economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
GDP growth recovered significantly in 1993 and the 6.7 per cent
increase in 1995 brought GDP back to its 1989 level. Inflation
fell to 37 per cent in 1993 and continues to fall.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 budget was approved by 268 votes to 116 with three
abstentions. The budget gained support from the ruling coalition
composed of the Socialist Democratic Party and the Polish Peasant
Party, but ran into resistance from the Freedom Union, the Union
of Labor and other opposition parties.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Albania will resume railway
transportation to the Yugoslav Republic this month and open two
new checkpoints on its border with the Republic of Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
The decision to resume transportation on the Bajez-Podgorica
railway, the only railroad linking Albania and other Balkan and
European nations, was made after Albania lifted its economic
sanction on the republic recently.
</P>
<P>
Albania suspended railway transportation after the United
Nations imposed economic and diplomatic sanctions on the former
Yugoslavia in May 1992, seriously affecting the economy in
Albania, especially its northern area.
</P>
<P>
The decision to set up two new border checkpoints was made two
years ago to enhance economic contacts. There has been only one
customs office between Albania and the Republic of Montenegro.

<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, January 12 (Xinhua) -- More overseas investors are
flocking to north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, thanks
to its sound network of road, air and waterway transportation.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years the region has earmarked a total of 75
million yuan for the construction or expansion of 18 trade ports
of entry in the border areas, thus greatly boosting the handling
capacity of those ports.
</P>
<P>
The highway ports can handle one million tons of cargoes
annually, while the railways move in and out five million tons.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that during the 1991-1995 period Inner
Mongolia handled a total of 18.3 million tons of cargoes as well
as five million passengers. Its trade volume reached 1.1 billion
yuan-worth in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Improved transportation infrastructures have provided a
favorable investment environment in the region and attracted
business people from over 30 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Now the region is home to 1,068 overseas companies engaged in
20 industries, including textiles, energy, transportation,
chemicals, and posts and telecommunications. Direct investment by
overseas firms totaled 750 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The influx of foreign capital has eased the cash strains and
made up for shortages of funds required for the region's economic
construction.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-funded firms, which earned a total of 58.36 million US
dollars from exports last year, have become an active factor in
the local economy.

<HEADLINE> Hubei Outlines Economic Blueprint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Hubei Province, traditionally an
inland agricultural base in central China, is devoting itself to
become a rising star in China's Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
The pledge was made by Jia Zhijie, secretary of Hubei
Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), at an
economic conference held here recently after consulting with local
economists.
</P>
<P>
It reflects the ardent desire of local people and is an
inevitable trend of local economic growth, Jia said.
</P>
<P>
Hubei's gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an average
rate of 12.6 percent in the country's Eighth Five-Year Plan
(1991-1995), one percent higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
Its output of steel plate, building materials, automobiles,
electricity and cotton ranked fourth in the nation, and grain
production was in eighth place. All these have laid a solid
foundation for rapid and sustained economic development, Jia said.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing the favorable international and domestic conditions
for Hubei, the party secretary said that Asia, especially
Southeast Asia, has become the most dynamic region in the
world. In East Asia the growth of China has attracted growing
attention from many countries. Hubei holds an important position
in China's development as it links north with south China.
</P>
<P>
The province is in the heyday of its development. The Ninth
Five-Year Plan will witness an accelerated pace of development in
central and western China, operation of the Kowloon-Beijing
Railway, the longest north-south artery, and construction of the
Three Gorges hydroelectric power project, believed to be the
largest of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
To boost economic development Hubei should seize the excellent
opportunity to put the grand national and provincial plans into
action, the secretary said.
</P>
<P>
As the first year of the Ninth Five-Year Plan, 1996 is a vital
period for all-round economic development, he said.
</P>
<P>
The province will place emphasis on changing the economic
growth mode, raising the efficiency of enterprises and giving
priority to the production of brand-name products.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government is to build a number of nationwide
enterprise groups and encourage large and profitable enterprises
to purchase, merge or buy the stocks of small ones.
</P>
<P>
As a leading auto producer in central China, Hubei is striving
to turn the Dongfeng (East Wind) Automobile Company, which has 40
sub-companies and 37 auto parts plants, into a prestigious auto
giant in both China and the world.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it will develop highly-efficient agriculture, build
more farm produce bases and boost village industry.

conflict that occurred in December in which a Brazilian gold
prospector died, Brazilian Foreign Ministry sources said today.
</P>

Brazilian territory in the state of Roraima, when the soldiers
exchanged shots with a group of gold miners, killing one of the
workers.

Vice Foreign Minister Milos Alcalay will travel to Brazil to
present the apology to Brazilian Foreign Minister Luiz Felipe

<HEADLINE> Promise Seen in Northwest Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The rapid growth of oil fields
in the far northwest of China is firing the petroleum industry to
explore the area further, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The industry, encouraged by growth of 12 percent oil production
in the area last year, wants to step up exploration to ensure
there is enough energy to support the national economy in the next
century.
</P>
<P>
According to the China National Petroleum Corp, 12.6 million
tons of oil was produced in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region last
year, up 12 percent over 1994.
</P>
<P>
Of the output, 2.5 million tons were produced in the Tarim
Basin, a rise of 29 percent, and 2.2 million tons from the
Turpan-Hami Basin, up by 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
The figure are preliminary and are expected to be adjusted
later.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the achievements, the industry is considering
major measures to step up exploration for more big fields.
</P>
<P>
As much as one billion tons of reserves are expected to be
confirmed in the Tarim Basin over the next five years. Resources
are estimated at ten billion tons of oil and 8,000 billion cubic
meters of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
To date, eight major oil fields have been verified and 23
oil-bearing geological structures that have industrial value have
been found in Tarim.
</P>
<P>
These discoveries ensure a capacity to produce an annual 4.6
million tons of crude oil and 2.5 billion cubic meters of natural
gas, Zhong Shude, vice-president of the Tarim Petroleum
Exploration and Development Headquarters, said.
</P>
<P>
Of the oil fields discovered, four are now productive. By the
end of last year, a total of 7.8 million tons of oil had been
produced.
</P>
<P>
Annual capacity will reach 4.6 million tons when the Tazhong 4
Oil Field, the biggest of the eight, is completed.
</P>
<P>
By the turn of the century, annual production of oil will be
eight million tons and that of natural gas will be one million
cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the western area could become a strategic
energy base to support the national economy over the next five
years as more than half of the country's total petroleum resources
are contained there.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela to Import 2 Million Tons of Corn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela will import 2 million
tons of corn this year to make up for the drop in domestic
production due to the rise in fertilizer prices, the Agricultural
Production Federation said today.
</P>
<P>
half a million tons of white corn will be for human consumption
and 1.5 million tons will be used for fodder, it said. Domestic
white corn output in 1995 stood at 800,000 tons and that of
fodder, 2 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The federation warned that domestic corn production will
continue to fall this year due to the lack of "incentive measures"
to farmers and the rise in fertilizer prices, which now account
for 10 percent of the total production cost.
</P>
<P>
Corn, rice and sorghum are Venezuela's most important agricultural
products.

<HEADLINE> Another DFH-3 Satellite to Be launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- China expects to launch another
Dongfanghong No.3(DFH-3) satellite, also called Zhongxing No.6,
from Xichang, the country's satellite launching base, in the first
quarter of this year, to replace the former DFH-3, according to
the "People's Posts and Telecommunications News".
</P>
<P>
The first DFH-3, launched November 30, 1994, was a synchronous
telecommunications satellite that China had developed
independently. It failed to go into orbit because of fuel
exhaustion caused by a leakage in its altitude-control thruster.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the General Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of
Posts and Telecommunications, together with the China Radio and
Telecommunications Satellite Company, decided to launch another
satellite to take its place.
</P>
<P>
The Zhongxing No.6 has a designed life span of eight years, and
24 c-band transponders, as the other one did.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Income From Coffee Exports Drops in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The drop in the price of coffee
in the international market caused a 11.3 percent reduction in the
income of Brazil obtained from its coffee exports in 1995, the
Brazilian Federation of Coffee Exporters (Febec) said today.
</P>
<P>
Febec data show that last year Brazil exported coffee worth 1.9
billion dollars, against 2.2 billion dollars in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The 11.9 million 60-kilo bags of coffee sold abroad in 1995
were 18.5 percent less than the 14.6 million bags exported in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian coffee exports in December were only 781,500 bags, 43
percent less than the total exported in the same month a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Coffee export income for December was 109 million dollars,
while it was 263 million dollars for the same month of 1994.

<HEADLINE> Lessening Soil Erosion Paying Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Some two million ha of new
farmland with stable yields ensured by better irrigation
facilities have been built over the last five years, thanks to
continuous erosion-control efforts throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The new land has produced some 1.5 billion kg of grains each
year during the 1991-1995 period.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the newly developed farmland was created through
building thousands of silt arresters, transforming low-yield land
into high-yield land, terracing mountainous slopes and harnessing
rivers," today's China Daily quoted a deputy-director of the
Department of Water and Soil Erosion Control as saying.
</P>
<P>
Jiao Junren, the deputy-director, viewed that this as "one of
the most remarkable achievements China has accomplished in its
intensified fight against worsening water and soil erosion," a
chronic problem affecting over one-third of the country's total
territory.
</P>
<P>
Jiao attributed the successes to five major breakthroughs made
in the period:
</P>
<P>
-- 1991's erosion-control law;
</P>
<P>
-- family planning;
</P>
<P>
-- protection of farmland and the environment;
</P>
<P>
-- combating the soil erosion caused by rapid urban
construction; and
</P>
<P>
-- listing erosion control in the State's overall programme for
economic development and social progress.
</P>
<P>
Other successes during the 1991-1995 period were the reduction
of 18 billion cubic meters of sediment that had silted up a river
bed; planting of water- and soil-retaining forests; control of
water and soil erosion in 175,300 square km along China's seven
largest rivers, Jiao said.
</P>
<P>
Such efforts have not only played a significant role in lifting
millions of local residents out of poverty caused by serious soil
erosion, but have laid a foundation for local authorities to use
erosion control in sustainable economic-development plans.
</P>
<P>
With the development of the market economy, a pilot project has
encouraged the families to buy eroded land at public auction, then
reclaim it. This system has now been adopted in 23 provinces, Jiao
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's exports to Europe
increased 40 percent in 1995, but the rise was not enough to
reduce the big deficit it has with the European Union, its second
largest trading partner.
</P>
<P>
Mexico had a trade deficit of 3 billion U.S. dollars with the
European Union in 1995, even though exports from the EU dropped
30 percent due to Mexico's economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
But the country had a 10-billion-dollar trade surplus with the
United States, its partner in the North American Free Trade
Agreement.
</P>
<P>
One of the problems faced by Mexican exporters to the EU is
quality and complying with EU standards. Jacques Lecompte,
European Commission ambassador to Mexico said that in 1996 the EU,
together with the Mexican Commerce and Industrial Promotion
Ministry and the National Bank of Foreign Trade will invest 2.1
million dollars in a training program for small and medium-sized
Mexican enterprises to improve their sales to Europe.

<HEADLINE> China to Open Renminbi Business to Foreign Banks (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1995, China's State Council, or cabinet, allowed foreign
financial institutions to set up operating subsidiaries in
Beijing, Shijiangzhuang, Wuhan, Xi'an, Chengdu, Chongqing, Hefei,
Shenyang, Kunming and Suzhou -- all interior cities. Four foreign
banks have established branches in Beijing, China's capital.
</P>
<P>
China's booming economy has propelled the growth of foreign
financial institutions in China.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last November foreign financial firms and banks
had 18.33 billion US dollars in assets, 12.05 billion US dollars
in loans outstanding, three billion US dollars in deposits
outstanding, 150 million US dollars in net profits. These were
rises of 40.7 percent, 67.7 percent, 11 percent and 66.7 percent,
respectively, according to statistics released by the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Most of the foreign financial institutions operate in
accordance with China's laws, although individual ones have acted
against local financial laws and regulations, causing damage which
could have been avoided.
</P>
<P>
To protect Chinese depositors' interests and ensure stability
in China's financial system, China has taken measures, including
strictly examining and approving foreign financial institutions,
training more personnel and paying more attention to risk
management, to strengthen supervision of foreign financial
institutions.

<HEADLINE> China to Open Renminbi Business to Foreign Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- China is preparing for the
experimental opening of renminbi yuan (the Chinese currency)
business to foreign financial institutions, a senior Chinese
banking official said.
</P>
<P>
"When the conditions are ripe, China will extend the business
to more foreign banks," said Yang Wenyou, director of the
Department of Foreign Financial Institutions of the People's Bank
of China, the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Yang pointed out, however, that at present China can not allow
foreign banks to handle local money business, which has a bearing
on China's reforms of its economic system, state commercial banks
and monetary regulatory mechanism.
</P>
<P>
"China's state specialized banks, which have just begun to be
transformed into commercial banks, still undertake some
policy-oriented business and shoulder heavier tax burdens than
foreign banks, and the monetary regulatory mechanism has much room
for improvement," Yang explained.
</P>
<P>
On another development, Yang said that China plans to approve
more operating foreign financial institutions in 1996, and
introduce more to inland cities.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the central bank approved the establishment of 18
foreign bank branches, two foreign insurance companies, one joint
venture investment bank and 82 representative offices of foreign
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995 China had approved 137 operating foreign
financial institutions, including 117 foreign bank branches, five
joint-venture banks, five wholly foreign-funded banks, five
joint-venture or wholly foreign-funded financial firms, four
foreign insurance companies and one joint-venture investment
company. The number of representative offices of foreign financial
institutions had risen to 519.

<HEADLINE> ACOG to Hand Free Olympic Tickets to Poor Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Atlanta Committee for
the Olympic Games (ACOG) announced today that it plans to give
nearly 21,000 free Olympic Games tickets to poor U.S. children.
</P>
<P>
Billy Payne, president of ACOG, said the tickets "will allow
many of Georgia's children, who otherwise would not be able to
afford tickets, to experience the drama and excitement of the
Olympic Games first-hand."
</P>
<P>
Of the 20,900 tickets to be handed out, 16,400 tickets will be
available for children in Georgia, the home state of Atlanta. Four
other cities outside Georgia that are hosting Olympic soccer
competition, including Birmingham, Alabama; Washington, D.C.;
Orlando, Florida; and Miami, Florida, will receive 1,000 tickets
each.
</P>
<P>
Another 500 tickets will be given to children in Winston-Salem,
North Carolina, the headquarter city for Sara Lee Corp's Hanes
division, primary sponsor of the Children's Olympic Ticket Fund.
</P>
<P>
The 20,900 tickets for poor children are going to be paid by
the fund. The fund has raised more than 500,000 dollars to date,
mainly by selling Hanes' Olympic Games T-shirt and collecting fees
paid to the ACOG Speakers Bureau.
</P>
<P>
ACOG said it was mailing ticket applications to children
organizations and would notify qualified groups of selection in
May.
</P>
<P>
Selected groups will receive tickets to one of 20 sporting
events or Olympic arts festivals. The children also will receive
Olympic merchandise and meal coupons.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Optimistic about Budget Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Thursday said he was optimistic that an agreement could be
reached with congressional Republicans on balancing the budget in
seven years.
</P>
<P>
At a White House press conference, Clinton said, "Historic
agreement on a balanced budget is within reach, if we set aside
partisanship and work to seize this moment."
</P>
<P>
"I'm optimistic that we will balance the budget and I know we
have come too far to let this opportunity slip away," Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the two sides' remaining differences, Clinton said,
"It's not as simple as splitting the difference -- there's more
than money at stake here, there's policies at stake."
</P>
<P>
On the possibility of yet another government shutdown, Clinton
said, "I do not believe it will shut down again. There is not a
need to shut down again. I'm telling you, we are not that far
apart."
</P>
<P>
Clinton dismissed a suggestion earlier in the week by House
Speaker Newt Gingrich that a budget agreement might not be struck
before the November election.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he had talked to Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole
today and asked him if Republican leaders planned to resume
negotiations with him next Wednesday. "I got a pretty good
response," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Police Start to Patrol Sarajevo Suburbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, January 11 (Xinhua) - International police task force
have started patrols in Serb-held suburbs of Sarajevo, a U.N.
spokesman said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Alexander Ivanko said in Sarajevo that 117 police of
the U.N. force had now arrived in Bosnia to assist in implementing
the civilian aspects of the Bosnian peace accord.
</P>
<P>
According to the peace agreement, the international police
force will consist of 1,700 U.N. personnel.
</P>
<P>
Ivanko added that 60 policemen were stationed in Sarajevo and
had already carried out "two or three patrols" in Ilidza, and
other currently Serb-held Sarajevo areas due to revert under
government control within weeks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Antonio Pedauye, the former civilian chief of the
U.N. peace-keeping mission and currently a U.N. coordinator to
Bosnia, said that freedom of movement is neither secured by the
NATO forces nor by U.N. police, but only by signatories to the
peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.N. police will only monitor, inform and
train local police forces.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the incidents of Muslim travelers being detained
in Serb-controlled areas, the NATO peace treaty implementing
forces said that it would be up to U.N. police to solve the such
issues.

LONDON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali has launched verbal attacks upon those
member states which withheld their dues to the organization.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a London conference commemorating the first session
of the U.N. General Assembly exactly 50 years ago on Wednesday,
Ghali said that some member states withheld payments because they
said the organization was ineffective.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has solved disputes and helped to bring peace,
development and democracy in every continent, but now it is facing
grave problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations is weakened by its member states' inability
to follow through their own decisions," he said,
</P>
<P>
He explained that "on the one hand, there is a clear commitment
from member states, but one the other hand, there is a failure to
provide the means to make those commitments real."
</P>
<P>
It was reported the Secretary General is planning to hold a
meeting of the Special Assembly soon to discuss the cash issue.

<HEADLINE> Lady Thatcher Further Fuels Feuds within Tory Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Former British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher launched a severe attack on the left-wing in her
Conservative party.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to a conference organized this evening by the
Centre for Police Studies, the Tory right-wing "think-tank", Lady
Thatcher dismissed as "boloney" the claims from the left-wing that
the Tory party was in political trouble because it had lurched to
the right.
</P>
<P>
She said, "We are unpopular, above all, because the middle
classes and all those who aspire to join the middle classes, fell
that they no longer have the incentives and opportunities they
expect from a Conservative government."
</P>
<P>
Thatcher urged the Conservative government to carry out the
principles she laid down in 1980s, namely small government, tax
cuts, deregulation, help for home-owners and national sovereignty
in a bid to regain the confidence of the middle classes who had
been traditional supporters of the Tories.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Thatcher's speech is surely to cause
counterattacks from the left wing and pro-European Tory parliament
members.

<HEADLINE> Police End Rebel Takeover Of Liberia Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Liberian Armed police today
flushed out armed rebels from the Central Bank of Liberia in the
capital Monrovia without firing a shot.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today said the rebels, armed with
grenades and primitive weapons, had entered the bank overnight on
Wednesday, demanding the reinstatement of sacked bank governor
Raleigh Seekie.
</P>
<P>
Seekie was forced to leave the bank's building several hours
later with the intervention of Liberia's most powerful faction
leader Charles Taylor who entered the bank with a large troop
of armed bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
"We used our own tactics to bring the guys out," said an
police officer who, together with hundreds of others, had
surrounded the bank following the rebels' takeover.
</P>
<P>
The police arrested eight rebels when they followed Seekie out
of the bank.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, who were opposed to the demand by their leader
Johnson for Seekie's removal, were later identified as dissident
militia members of the United Liberation Movement for Democratic
Liberia led by Roosevelt Johnson (ULIMO-J).
</P>
<P>
Units of the Nigerian-led peacekeeping force, which also
includes Ghanaian and Guinean soldiers, had surrounded the bank
at the start of the siege but did not intervene.
</P>
<P>
Seekie, nominated by Johnson, was appointed the Central Bank
governor. But Johnson later complained that Seekie had failed to
serve the interests of his faction, an apparent reference to
funding for ULIMO-J.
</P>
<P>
Despite the peaceful end, the bank siege raises questions as
to whether Johnson has full control of his militia, which is one
of the factions whose combined 60,000 guerrillas are due to start
surrendering weapons to West African peace-keepers next week.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, whose forces started the Liberian civil war in
december 1989, is now a member of the country's ruling council
under the Abuja peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The bank seizure happened as the United Nations observers,
West African peace-keepers and a joint ceasefire monitoring
commission of all factions were trying to consolidate a truce in a
fighting in Liberia's western town of Tubmanburg.
</P>
<P>
The battles left the the streets littered with bodies.
</P>
<P>
"The siege posed the latest threat to the Abuja peace accord
signed last August to end years of civil war in the West African
country," said a military observer.
</P>
<P>
Civil war has ravaged Liberia's economy, based on rubber,
timber, diamonds and iron ore. About 150,000 people, most of them
civilians, have been killed and half the pre-war population of
2.5 million displaced during the six-year old civil war.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Faces World Cup Ban From FIFA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nairobi, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The world's soccer governing
body FIFA today warned Nigeria of a ban from playing in the 1998
World Cup qualifiers should it insist on boycotting the African
Nations Cup.
</P>
<P>
FIFA General Secretary Joseph Blatter was quoted by a report
as saying that any ban placed on Nigeria for withdrawing from
most important soccer events in Africa would be extended to all
FIFA competitions, including the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is already at the verge of a four-year ban from all
African events, to be imposed by the Confederation of African
Football (CAF), for its boycotting of the African Nations Cup.
</P>
<P>
But the African soccer governing body is yet to make an
official announcement on punishment for Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The decision would be made public next week, said a CAF
official who declined to be named.
</P>
<P>
"If there is any sanction enforced by CAF against Nigeria, it
is obvious that FIFA will have no other alternative but to extend
that sanction to all its competitions," said Blatter.
</P>
<P>
"Any ban imposed by CAF has, in terms of the FIFA statutes,
to be applied to FIFA competitions as well," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, FIFA president Joao Havelange said the absence of
Nigeria in the African Nations Cup was "a great shame" for
African football and that he was continuing his efforts to
persuade Lagos to change its mind and send its national team the
"Super Eagles" to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The "Super Eagles", who are the defending champions of the
African Nations Cup, have withdrew from the 16-team competition
citing safety concerns for their players and officials in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The move followed South Africa's strong condemnation of the
execution of nine Ogoni minority activists in Nigeria last
November and the withdrawal of an invitation to the "Super
Eagles" to play in a friendly four-nation tournament at the end
of last year in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela had spearheaded
international efforts to impose sanctions on Nigeria citing its
human rights records, an act which resulted in the suspension of
the country's membership of the Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's boycott of the competition, according the analysts,
was an act of revenge on South Africa.
</P>
<P>
CAF president Issa Hayatou confirmed he had received an
official withdrawal from the Nigerian Football Association on
Thursday when he was re-elected another four-years of office.
</P>
<P>
"But we are still keeping the doors open to the west African
state," Hayatou said.
