<HEADLINE> Higher Growth Rate Essential to Eradicate African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Africa's annual Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) should reach 7 percent by the year 2015 if Africa is
to reach the U.N. Social Summit target of halving absolute poverty
by then, a U.N. official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting U. N. Secretary General's 1999 annual report, U.N.
Department of Economic and Social affairs special coordinator
Yventte Stevens told a regional meeting that the growth rate was
currently around 3 percent and was expected to reach 3.5 percent
by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
She said Africa's debt burden had increased from 344 billion
U.S. dollars in 1997 to 350 billion dollars in 1998, which
equivalent to 300 percent of the exports of goods and services for
Africa. Africa received less than 5 billion dollars in foreign
direct investment in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official noted that there had been an increase in the
primary education sector in Africa but that the low enrolment and
literacy rate was a matter of concern.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the three-day meeting is Social Development in
Eastern and Southern Africa.

ADDIS ABABA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia said Wednesday

civet production and export.
</P>
<P>
Hailu Mecha, wildlife development expert of the Ministry of

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Army Detains two Palestinian Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Amid a flaring crisis with the
Palestinian Authority, Lebanese army Wednesday detained two
Palestinian officials near a refugee camp in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Khaled Abu Adham and Khaled Shayeb, members of the Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction, were detained by Lebanese
army while travelling to the Rashidiya Palestinian camp near
Lebanese southern-most port city of Tyre.
</P>
<P>
They were reported to visit Sultan Abul-Ainayn, Arafat's top
aid in Lebanon, who has been sentenced to death by a Lebanese
military court last month.
</P>
<P>
Ainayn was convicted of forming and heading an armed gang with
the purpose of committing crimes against the people and their
properties and to defy the authority of the Lebanese state.
</P>
<P>
But, Ainayn described the court verdict as a political move
and refused to turn himself in to Lebanese authority.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has tightened security measures around the Palestinian
camps, especially the largest Ain al-Hilweh camp on the outskirts
of the southern port city of Sidon, home to 80,000 Palestinian
refugees, since the camp was controlled by Fatah in August.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon fears that Arafat will use his position in Lebanon as a
bargaining chip to persuade Israel to accept establishment of a
Palestinian state in return for abandoning the right of refugees
to return to the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's Palestinian authority accused Lebanese government of
conducting a radical discrimination against Palestinian people and
their cause.
</P>
<P>
Some 360,000 Palestinians are living in 12 refugee camps
across Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Not to Mediate in Congo Conflict Before </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
president Nelson Mandela said on Wednesday that only after the
Middle East peace process is resolved, he would consider mediating
in the civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Mandela told reporters at his Houghton home in Johannesburg
that it would be unwise for him to become involved in the DRC
peace process while he was still involved in a similar process in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"When the issue in the Middle East is resolved I will consider
involvement in the DRC," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the United Nations, the Organization of African
Unity and Zambian President Frederick Chiluba had done a good job
in talking to both parties involved in the DRC war.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said there were many experienced African leaders who
could act as mediators in the process.
</P>
<P>
"It is too early to give details on the issue."
</P>
<P>
Rebels in the DRC and members of Burundi's opposition party on
Tuesday separately called on the former president to mediate in
their conflicts.
</P>
<P>
A senior rebel in the DRC said all three rebel groups in the
country wanted Mandela to mediate in the conflict there.

<P>
Speaking Tuesday at a two-day workshop jointly held by the
Ministry for Industry and Commerce of Tanzania and the United
Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) to discuss the
country's SME policy, Desystancy Masawe, a consultant with UNIDO,
told the participants Tanzania' s existing legal and regulatory
framework was not favorable for SME development.
</P>
<P>
He cited cumbersome procedures like loan application, business
 registration and licensing.
</P>
<P>
In order to redress this situation, it is essential to bring
about the necessary reform of the legal and regulatory framework
through a deregulatory program, said Masawe.
</P>
<P>
Masawe also called for a devised tax collection system that
reduces the level and overall burden of taxation on the business
community especially the SMEs operators.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the workshop on Monday, the
Minister for Trade and Commerce of Tanzania Iddi Simba said in
recognition of the contribution of SMEs in the national economy,
the government is committed to developing a strong private sector.

</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Uganda Parliament Wednesday
refused a recommendation that the government sell its majority
shares in the New Vision Printing and Publishing Corporation
which produces the country's leading daily.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a session of the parliamentary
committee on national economy , Radio Uganda reported in the
evening.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Works, Housing and Communications John Nasasira
said that the New Vision has been performing very well and
therefore it is not advisable for the government to abandon it at
this time.
</P>
<P>
His views were backed by Minister of Local Government Bidandi
Ssali who argued that the New Vision is important in circulating
news and the government does not have to sell the paper in order
to show the privatization process is going fast.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, some MPs recommended that the government sell the
paper in the country's current privatization process. The
13-year-old daily is now the best-selling newspaper in the
African country.
</P>
<P>
At the same session, the committee resolved that the
government should retain majority shares in at least six
enterprises including Uganda Posts Limited, the National Water
and Sewage Corporation and Uganda Railways Corporation because
they are essential to the country's economy.

LONDON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- An aide to British Prime
Minister Tony Blair is to visit Syria with a message from Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak for Syrian President Hafez al-Assad,
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cook confirmed that Lord Levy, a Labour peer close to Blair,
would travel to Syria. But he gave no details of the message Levy
would be carrying.
</P>
<P>
"He goes as a personal representative of the prime minister of
Britain," Cook told reporters after talks with Egypt's Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
"Lord Levy has excellent contacts throughout the Middle East(
and) a good understanding of the peace process. We expect him to
be comparing notes on the state of the peace process, particularly
on Syria's role," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary said Levy, a leading member of Britain's
Jewish community who met Barak and Assad on a mission on Blair's
behalf earlier this year, would travel to Syria next week.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to London on Tuesday, Barak had a private
meeting with Lord Levy after discussions with Blair on Middle East
peace efforts, including the deadlocked Israeli-Syrian
negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Needs Export Growth Strategies: Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The reserve Bank of Zimbabwe
has urged the government to enact strategies that identify export
growth potential sectors.
</P>
<P>
In its latest report on economic highlights released here on
Wednesday, the central bank said policies such as the adoption of
measures to stimulate foreign currency earnings and revenue were
of great importance.
</P>
<P>
"Specific, and administratively simple and accessible
incentives to resuscitate the outward oriented drive should be
targeted at the export sectors, within the framework of the
country's industrialization policy," it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said export promotion strategy had to focus on the
development and support of new value added product ranges so as to
support various sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Policy interventions to effectively contain production cost
increases at levels prevailing in competitor markets were
necessary for export competitiveness, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
It said regional cooperation would foster economic growth
characterized by increases in the volume of exports.
</P>
<P>
"Global integration of major trading partners' economies and
production structures makes it imperative that local producers
develop an export culture that takes full advantages of
opportunities in the region," it said.
</P>
<P>
It added that through integration the country would secure the
rightful position to compete on the world markets and maintain a
stable balance of payment level.

UNTIED NATIONS, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Wednesday unanimously adopted a resolution,
deciding to extend the mandate of the United Nations Disengagement
Observer Force for a further period of six months until May 31,
2000.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the Security Council reviewed a report by
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the latest situation in the
Israeli-Syrian sector.
</P>
<P>
In the report, Annan said despite the present quiet in the
sector, the situation in the Middle East continues to be
potentially dangerous and is likely to remain so, unless and until
a comprehensive settlement covering all aspects of the Middle East
problem can be reached.
</P>
<P>
in connection with the resolution, the Security Council also
issued a presidential statement which said the Security Council
shared the view on the Middle East made by the Secretary-General
in his report.

UNDOF was established in May 1974 to supervise the ceasefire
called for by the United Nations Security Council and the
agreement on disengagement between Israel and Syrian forces of May

LUSAKA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Angolan foreign minister Joao
Bernardo Miranda said here Wednesday that Zambian government had
promised not to allow Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi to escape
through its territory.
</P>
<P>
Miranda told a joint press conference before returning home
after a two- day visit to Zambia that Lusaka also pledged full
support for Angolan government's every effort to achieve lasting
peace in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Foreign Minister Keli Walubita described Miranda's
visit as " highly successful" which paved the way for the meeting
of the presidents of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique issued at the end of the visit the two
sides stressed the need for the two countries to be constantly
vigilant against external forces that are bent on creating
mistrust and discord between them.
</P>
<P>
They called for the reactivation of the bilateral mechanisms
to address all matters of concern to the two countries.
</P>
<P>
They hoped that the improvement in the security situation in
Angola will enable the two countries to resume normal economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two sides hoped that police, security, immigration and
customs officials in the border areas to meet more regularly to
address issues that arise from time to time in these areas.
</P>
<P>
Early this year Angola repeatedly accused Zambia of allowing
its territory to be used as a springboard for military and
logistic supplies to the rebel National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA). Zambia strongly denied the
accusation.
</P>
<P>
With the mediation by the Organization for African Unity (OAU)
in June, Angola withdrew its accusation and proposed that the past
misunderstanding be forgot and a new chapter be opened in their
relations.

<P>
LONDON, Nov 24 (Xinhua) - The average price paid for homes in
England and Wales has risen 12 percent in the past year, according
to the UK's official Land Registry.
</P>
<P>
Sales from July to September show sustained recovery across the
country with traditionally depressed regions enjoying significant
house price rises.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the average house in England and Wales is 97,616
pounds, with projections for growth of about 10 percent in the
final quarter to Christmas.
</P>
<P>
As ever, the boom is being led by London, where house prices
rose by an average of 16.8 percent. The average London house sold
for 155,662 pounds this summer - up by more than 20,000 pounds
since last year.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, a leading UK mortgage lender, last month raised its
forecast for house price rises to 11 percent from 8 percent for
1999 and to 9 percent from 6 percent for next year.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of England cited concerns about the fast rise in
property prices as one of the reasons behind its decision to raise
rates.
</P>
<P>
The bank's view is that it could lead to a repeat of the
damaging house price-fuelled boom of the late 1980s.

AMMAN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid said here Wednesday that his country fully
supports the positions adopted by Jordan and the Palestinians in
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a press briefing after talks with
Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Arafat paid a brief visit to Amman Wednesday to inform the two
leaders of the latest developments in the final status talks

Apart from the peace process, Wahid said he also held talks
with King Abudllah on ways of strengthening bilateral ties in
various fields, and a joint committee will soon resume its work on
bilateral cooperation and coordination.
</P>
<P>
He said he agreed with King Abdullah to deepen and intensify
relations among countries of the Muslim world by coordination on
important issues.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Russian Media, Politicians Praise Putin's 100-Day Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wednesday marks the hundredth day of Putin in the post of
Russia's fifth prime minister in the past 18 months. Now he is the
most hopeful candidate for the next Russian president, according
to the latest public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency Wednesday said in a comment, entitled
"Putin 100 Days in Post", that the "phenomenon of Putin" is
increasingly becoming the modern talking while his rating has been
growing continuously over the past two months with Russian forces
pressing deeper into Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The comment said Putin's status of a "rating favorite" is
further improved by his image of not only a patriot, who will
defend Russia's interests with all means and at any cost, but also
a man of action and a pragmatist who calculates his next step
cautiously.
</P>
<P>
Another consideration is that playing on the political field,
from which no politicians can stay away, Putin has made it so that
both the rightist and the leftist oppositions find themselves
backing him up, said the Itar-Tass report.
</P>
<P>
The Wednesday issue of Rossiyskaya Gazeta (Russian Newspaper)
said the result of Putin's one hundred days as Prime Minister is
that "we after all have seen a strong able leader."
</P>
<P>
The newspaper cited as Putin's achievements his "style, methods
and results in Chechnya that are carried out, unlike in the
previous campaign, more cautiously and effectively."
</P>
<P>
Nezavisimaya Gazeta (Independent Newspaper) vastly praised
Putin.
</P>
<P>
"Putin in fact personifies the idea of the fight against
terrorism that has been able to secure unprecedented unification
of all political forces. Taking into account the upcoming
parliamentary elections and all inevitable controversies related
to them, this is indeed a unique case," said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"Vladimir Putin, who was little known before taking the post of
premier, has suddenly got popularity of an indisputable political
leader. The army, according to its assessment, has first felt
behind its shoulders a will that will not fail at the most
critical moment," said the military daily Krasnaya Zvezda (Red
Stars).
</P>
<P>
The paper Kommersant (Businessman) commented on Putin's Tuesday
speech on the improving national socioeconomic situation at a
meeting of the Coordinating Council of Domestic Producers.
</P>
<P>
"Its essence can be expressed in two slogans: 'No to revision
of privatization results' and 'economic growth through support of
an effective owner'," Kommersant said.
</P>
<P>
Yegor Stroyev, chairman of the Federation Council (upper house
of the Russian parliamentary), Wednesday told reporters that Putin
proved to be a man "who can speak openly and openly insist on
implementation of what he had said."
</P>
<P>
"Putin was wise enough to oppose public opinion on the Chechnya
problem, saying 'either we do away with bandits, or they do away
with Russia'. And those who were vaccinating in the beginning, had
to agree with the prime minister later," said the speaker.
</P>
<P>
Russian first vice-premier Nikolai Aksenenko said in an
interview that the main results of the first hundred days of the
Putin-led cabinet's work are "real growth in Russia's industrial
production."
</P>
<P>
"Industry did not register such growth in the past," he said,
referring to "very serious statistics": the industrial output
climbed by 7.5 percent over the first nine months this year and
growth was registered both by export industries and by those
oriented on domestic consumption.
</P>
<P>
"The financial position of enterprises is also improving: their
profits jumped up five times between January and August against
the similar period of 1998, while the number of profit-making
enterprises has also grown," he said.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Ryzhkov, parliamentary leader of the Our Home is
Russia said in an interview that "Putin has shown himself as a
strong and efficient premier with a sufficiently high potential
over the hundred days of his stay in power."
</P>
<P>
"On the whole, the hundred days of this his premiership should
be regarded as a positive," because Putin kept "good inside
organization of the cabinet acting as a united and well-knit team"
and managed to "maintain conflict-free cooperation with the
Russian president's office," said Ryzhkov,
</P>
<P>
The legislator described the style, methods and results of the
government operation in Chechnya as "an unchallenging achievement".
"This operation is conducted, in contrast to the 1994-1996 Chechen
war, more circumstantially, cautiously and effectively," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, delivering a report on government work at
the State Duma, lower house of the parliament, Putin positively
evaluated the current economic, financial and social situation in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
"Positive trends to steady economy growth have persist for
continuous 14 months for the first time since the start of the
reforms in the country, and Russia's gross domestic product is
expected to rise 2 percent in 1999," he told the deputies.
</P>
<P>
The rate of inflation in the fist ten months of the year stood
at 31.5 percent, as compared with the earlier predicted 50-60
percent, Putin said, adding that the budget deficit is decreasing
rapidly and a foreign trade surplus of 21.2 billion U.S. dollars
has been achieved for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Definite progress has also been made in the social welfare
sphere, Putin said. The pension debt has been repaid and salaries
are being paid to servicemen and workers at state-run
organizations monthly, while unemployment decreased from 13
percent in 1998 to 11.7 percent in November 1999.

<HEADLINE> Ireland to Deliver Millennium Candles to Every Home in the Country </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 24 (Xinhua)-- The Irish government plans to
deliver a candle to every home in the country, to be lit as the
last rays of the millennium fade on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
In the next few weeks the Irish postal service will distribute
a candle, complete with presentation box and scroll, to each of
the Irish republic's 1.3 million homes, a Reuters report said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The idea is that shortly after 4.00 pm on New Year's Eve
everybody in the country will light their candles in what we see
as a very simple, very symbolic, secular ceremony to mark the end
of the millennium," the report quoted Tom Rowley, of the
government-appointed National Millennium Committee, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The scroll included with the candle is headed with lines from
national poet William Butler Yeats' celebrated verse "To Ireland
in the Coming Times", Rowley said.
</P>
<P>
He said he had received inquiries about the candles from Irish
expatriates around the world.
</P>
<P>
"The event has caught the imagination of Irish people
everywhere, "he said.
</P>
<P>
The "Last Light" plan was almost snuffed out at an advanced
stage when organizers realized the candles would not fit through
the average Irish letter box. The day was saved when the postal
service agreed to deliver the gifts person-to-person, the Reuters
report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) has urged African countries to pay more attention to
non-communicable diseases like hypertension.
</P>
<P>
There is need to come up with concrete and implementable
measures for preventing and managing the disease in Africa,
Director of the WHO African Regional Office Ebrahim Samba told a
meeting on hypertension control in Harare Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The measures should be for immediate implementation by the WHO
and its member countries, Samba said.
</P>
<P>
He said there is need to adopt the 1999 WHO/International
Society of Hypertension guidelines for the management of the
disease to the African situation.
</P>
<P>
Hypertension is said to be one of the prevalent
non-communicable disease in the continent. Up to 20 million
people in Africa suffer from hypertension and the population with
the disease continue to increase with a greater number of them
living in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The WHO official expressed concern at the misconception that
non- communicable diseases are a burden of developed countries and
affluent societies only.
</P>
<P>
"Non-communicable diseases are becoming increasingly common in
developing countries, including those in the African region and we
look up to experts to show the way forward," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Arab Israeli MPs Beaten in Clash With Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Three Arab Israeli Knesset
(parliament) members accused police of beating them with batons
in Jerusalem during their protest in front of the Prime Minister's
office on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Tibi, Azmi Bishara, both from the Balad party, and Taleb
A-Sanna from the United Arab List, charged police with brutality
while they were interviewed by a local radio.
</P>
<P>
They alleged that the police continued to beat them even after
they identified themselves as Knesset members.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred during a stormy protest led by local Arab
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the local Arab authorities have been on strike since
Monday to urge the government to provide immediate funding to
cover their deficits and increase budget allocations.
</P>
<P>
According to an initial report, two were hurt during the
violent clash and taken away in an ambulance. Six people were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
In response to the accusation, Deputy Commander of Jerusalem
Police admitted the force was used to break up the demonstration.
But he said it was necessary to do so because the organizers had
lost control and the protest was turned into one of the most
violent demonstrations Jerusalem had ever seen.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that there were about 2,000 demonstrators who were
storming the gate of Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office and
blocked access to the compound.

<HEADLINE> Iraq: British Proposal Aims to Deceive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz said on Wednesday that the British proposal for
conditional suspension of the U.N. sanctions on Iraq is aimed at
deceiving the international public opinion.
</P>
<P>
Aziz made the remarks at the opening ceremony of a poetry
festival attended by some 300 Arab and foreign poets, critics and
journalists.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain have recently been pushing for
the adoption of a British-Dutch proposal which recommends a
conditional suspension of the sanctions after Iraq agrees to
allow United Nations weapons inspectors to return to the country
and put its oil revenues under the U.N. control.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official, however, termed the proposal as "poison
covered with glittering paper."
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq has studied the proposal thoroughly and deeply and
found out that it is but an attempt to deceive the international
public opinion, he added.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has repeatedly declared its rejection to the proposal,
saying it will not accept any U.N. resolution that falls short of
total and comprehensive lifting of the sanctions imposed on it in
1990 following its invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Yemen Backs Lebanon's Stance in Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Yemeni Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdul Qader Ba-Jammal
said Wednesday his country fully supports Lebanon's stance in the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who
is also foreign minister, Ba-Jammal told reporters that Yemen is
with Lebanon in the peace talks with Israel and demands the Jewish
state to withdraw troops from south Lebanon without any conditions.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been in control of parts of Lebanon since 1978 and
set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon 1985 with
the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese guerrillas'
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has been asking Israel to implement the United Nations
Resolution 425, which calls for an unconditional Israeli pullout,
and insisting on a unity of the Lebanese and Syrian tracks in the
peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
With 35,000 troops stationed in Lebanon, Syria has a definite
say in the country's foreign policy toward Israel.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Ba-Jammal and Hoss also stressed the
necessity for boosting bilateral economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Ba-Jammal said he will sign four agreements with Lebanese
officials on Thursday with regard to the establishment of a joint
Yemeni-Lebanese Committee, encouragement of investments and trade,
and avoidance of dual taxation between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Pak Asks India for Positive Approach to Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Foreign Secretary
Ahmed Shamshad Wednesday hoped that India would adopt a more
positive approach toward the need of the region which is peace and
stability on the basis of a final settlement of the Kashmir
problem.
</P>
<P>
Talking to the media during a local function, Shamshad said,
"Sincere and purposeful approach" is required for a meaningful
dialogue between Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
He said that unless the Kashmir problem is solved there could
not be peace in this region.
</P>
<P>
Without a peaceful solution of the core issue of Kashmir, he
added, tension and instability will plague this part of the world.
</P>
<P>
"There is an open offer for dialogue to India. It is up to
India to reciprocate our offer with the same sincerity that we are
demonstrating," said Shamshad.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Peaceful settlement of disputes through dialogue is
the need of the time and need of our region."
</P>
<P>
But obviously for any dialogue, unless the two sides engage
themselves in sincere talks, "that dialogue becomes meaningless,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary said Pakistan is a pro-dialogue country.
"We shall never run away from dialogue. But we don't beg for it,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is ready for dialogue with India with dignity and
"without preconditions," Shamshad said.
</P>
<P>
He regretted that India was raising "preconditions that are
unacceptable to us. Their preconditions involve the very issues
that can only be addressed through dialogue."
</P>
<P>
Indians speak of "conducive environment and restoration of
'trust'," but it is only through dialogue that "we can achieve
these objectives after meaningfully addressing the core issue of
Jammu and Kashmir," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad said that neither trust nor a tension-free environment
would return to the region as long as the core issue of Kashmir is
not resolved.

OTTAWA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- A Montreal-bound Via train
derailed late Tuesday after smashing into a truck in eastern
Ontario, Canada, local reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At least six of the 101 passengers on board were injured and
sent to a nearby hospital, which has said no one is in serious
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred 60 kilometers east of Toronto at about 7
p.m., when the Via train "rattled and rolled" and then derailed
after smashing into a burning truck, which was first crashed by a
freight train.
</P>
<P>
The freight train dragged the truck more than a half-kilometre
until it went off the tracks with the truck stuck on a level
crossing.
</P>
<P>
The driver of the flatbed truck jumped clear before the vehicle
was struck by the freight train, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
All of the passengers were evacuated to the nearby Darlington
Nuclear Station.
</P>
<P>
The derailment will likely mean delays Wednesday along Via
routes from Toronto to Ottawa and Montreal, according to Via
spokesman Malcolm Andrews.
</P>
<P>
This is a third collision-induced derailment this month, the
local CTV television said. On November 9, a high-speed passenger
train crashed into a dump truck near Acton, west of Toronto,
killing the truck driver and injuring 11 others.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Surges at 5.5 Percent in Third Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy surged
ahead to an annual rate of 5.5 percent in the third quarter,
powered by rising inventories, strong consumption and an improved
trade performance, the Commerce Department reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Department said that the increase in the nation's gross
domestic product(GDP), far higher than the 4.8 percent in its
first estimate a month ago, followed a modest 1.9 percent rate of
growth in the second Quarter.
</P>
<P>
Today's report exceeded many economists' expectations. It was
the strongest gain since a 5.9 percent surge in the final three
months of last year.
</P>
<P>
The report said despite such strong growth in GDP, prices
remained muted, registering an annual 1.1 percent increase in the
implicit price deflator, a key inflation measure.
</P>
<P>
The Department said the upward revision in overall growth had
primarily been caused by the increases in corporate inventories,
reflecting a struggles by firms to keep up with the brisk pace of
consumer demand -- the main engine behind the almost nine-year old
U.S. economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending, which accounts for some two-thirds of the U.
S. economy, rose by 4.6 percent, more brisk than previously
estimated. Inventories increased by a hefty 33.9 billion dollars,
more than the originally reported 28.1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Adding to the robust economy was a steep downward revision in
imports, which the report said grew 14.6 percent in the third
quarter instead of the 17.2 percent increase previously estimated.
</P>
<P>
And, driven by a sharp gain in overseas earnings, helped by
improving economies abroad, corporate profits after taxes grew 3.0
percent to an annual rate of 598.6 billion dollars in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Business investment,spending on new equipment and plants, also
contributed to third-quarter growth, rising at an annual rate of
13.3 percent, compared with 7 percent in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Spending for new homes and apartments decreased at an annual
rate of 4.8 percent, in part reflectiong higher mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
All the changes show the U.S. economy growing at an annual rate
of 119.1 billion dollars in the third quarter of the year, pushing
the country's total output of goods and services to 8.9 trillion
dollars, after adjusting for inflation.

<P>
LUANDA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Sao Tome and Principe's Prime
Minister said the 15-day negotiation between his country and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank as "frankly
positive".
</P>
<P>
According to Guilherme Posser da Costa, the "positive"
negotiation means "a very important step towards signing the
program with IMF as soon as possible, in January or February,
2000."
</P>
<P>
Macroeconomic indicators have also been defined and fixed so
that the execution of the program in the next three years,
2000-2002, can be guided, with the financing of the World Bank,
said the Prime Minister.

<P>
The Prime Minister added that his government will continue the

<HEADLINE> German Chancellor Expected to Visit Egypt in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 24 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder is expected to pay an official visit to Egypt in
February at the invitation of President Hosni Mubarak, an Egyptian
Foreign Ministry official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Contacts are underway through diplomatic channels to finalize
the arrangements" for Schroeder's trip, the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, told Egypt's Middle East News Agency
(MENA).
</P>
<P>
Officials at the German embassy in Cairo on Wednesday confirmed
the report. A German diplomat, who asked not to be named, said
Schroeder's visit will come within the context of "close and
friendly relations between Germany and Egypt."
</P>
<P>
His visit also "forms part of the continued consultations
between the two countries' leaders" on bilateral ties and regional
issues, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
During his upcoming visit, Schroeder will hold talks with
Mubarak, Prime Minister Atef Obeid and senior officials on
enhancing economic and trade cooperation between the two
countries, MENA quoted the Egyptian official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Germany is Egypt's largest trade partner among the European
Union (EU) members and ranks the second after the United States in
providing aid to the north African country.
</P>
<P>
The leaders are expected to discuss issues in the Middle East
and Europe, including the Arab-Israeli peace talks and the
situation in the Gulf and the Balkans, the official added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel, is a key mediator between Arab countries and the Jewish
state. Germany, alongside the EU and its members, intends to play
a key role in this regard.

<HEADLINE> UK Conservatives Say Hacker Probed Bank Accounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Britain's opposition
Conservative Party has said its bank accounts were hacked into in
an apparent "dirty tricks" campaign over donations by its
treasurer, Belize-based businessman Michael Ashcroft.
</P>
<P>
The party has called in the police to investigate, but The
Times newspaper denied on Wednesday that any of its journalists
were involved in hacking.
</P>
<P>
The Times reported that Ashcroft had made large donations to
the party via a bank in Belize, but the Conservatives rejected
charges that this had broken their own pledge to ban foreign
donations.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Conservative chairman Tim Collins said Ashcroft was
entitled to donate the cash wherever the bank was registered.
</P>
<P>
The party has denied any wrongdoing over the one million pounds
(1.6 million U.S. dollars) donated by Ashcroft and said details in
The Times proved that an unauthorized person had looked at its
Royal Bank of Scotland accounts.
</P>
<P>
Party chairman Michael Ancram said in a statement: "This
appears to be the latest in a series of dirty tricks being
perpetrated by those who will stop at nothing in order to keep
this government in power.
</P>
<P>
"There is a climate of fear being created in Britain today.
Dissidents are being silenced. Opponents are being smeared.
</P>
<P>
"Now private bank accounts are being hacked into in order to
discredit and destroy anyone who stands in the way of this
government's lust for power," he added.
</P>
<P>
Times Editor Peter Stothard rejected the Conservative
accusations as "bizarre", telling BBC Radio "There has been no
hacking by anyone at the Times and I wouldn't condone anyone
hacking."

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The National Child Poverty
Report Card of Canada reports a 19.8 percent rate of child poverty
nation wide in 1997, as compared with 15.3 percent in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The organization released its report while dozens of
communities across the country began to mark the 10th anniversary
Tuesday night of the Commons resolution on the elimination of
child poverty by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The report puts Newfoundland at the highest of 22.8 percent for
child poverty in 1997, to be followed by Nova Scotia, which
registered a percentage of 22.4 for the problem.
</P>
<P>
In the country's richest province of Ontario, child poverty
reached almost 20 percent in 1997, 10 years after it recorded the
lowest rate of 11.6 percent in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Atlantic province of Prince Edward Island had the lowest
rate of 14.9 percent in 1997, says the report, which also urges
for tax policies to reduce the gap between the rich and poor while
increasing the minimum wage.

<HEADLINE> Museveni Misquoted on Dissolving Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President's Office
said Wednesday that President Yoweri Museveni did not wish to
dissolve parliament as reported in the Monitor newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Press Secretary Hope Kivengere said in a press
release that Museveni's address to the Parliament on Tuesday
evening was misreported by the paper Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the headline "Museveni Wished to Dissolve House", an
article in Monitor alleges that "If Uganda had been the United
Kingdom, he (Musevini) would have dissolved Parliament last year
over the AES Nile Independent Power saga."
</P>
<P>
The presidential press secretary clarified that this is a
misrepresentation of what the president said in his speech.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said that in Britain, in case the government fails to
get a majority to pass important legislation, the government
resigns and Parliament is dissolved, Hope explained.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the Monitor headline, it is clear that President
Museveni considers undemocratic the idea of giving the president
the power to dissolve Parliament any time, the press release
corrected.
</P>
<P>
President Museveni addressed several issues in his speech to
the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
He urged the legislature not to delay the country's economic
bills and to push forward the country's privatization process.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Museveni said the AES Nile Power, an American
company which is to build a hydroelectric power station at
Bujagali Falls on the Nile River, did not get the approval from
the Parliament until recently.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the Parliament for delaying it for several months.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Pro-UK Guerrillas Delay Decision on Decommissioning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Ulster Freedom Fighters(UFF)
, one of Northern Ireland's pro-British guerrilla groups, said on
Wednesday it was putting off naming a go-between to talk to
disarmament monitors.
</P>
<P>
The group has said it will not make the appointment until after
it has been confirmed that the Irish Republican Army (IRA) has
done so first.
</P>
<P>
While the UFF's move could prove a stumbling block in the
British province's tortuous quest for peace, it was seen as
significant because it was the first time the Protestant
guerrillas had mentioned the disarmament process.
</P>
<P>
The UFF said it was concerned about Sinn Fein comments playing
down the prospect of IRA decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
"The leadership of the Ulster Freedom Fighters has given its
consideration to political developments of the past week and
recognizes the potential for progress," the UFF said.
</P>
<P>
But it was putting off a decision on naming a go-between to
meet the province's independent disarmament commission "until
after the IRA has met its commitments to this regard".
</P>
<P>
The UFF move came after confusion over the IRA's position on
disarmament in its long-running guerrilla war against British rule
in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Another pro-British guerrilla group, the Ulster Volunteer Force,
has already named an envoy to the disarmament body.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein had no immediate comment on the UFF statement.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Population Fund Hails Restoration of U.S. Funding in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
resume its support for the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
for fiscal year 2000, which began on October 1, UNFPA officials
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the foreign assistance legislation approved by the U.S.
Congress last week, funding will be restored to the fiscal year
1998 level of 25 million U.S. dollars, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Fund's executive director, Nafis Sadik, welcomed the news,
saying that "I am very pleased that the United States has rejoined
the ranks of major UNFPA donors."
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. funds will help provide millions of women with
reproductive health care, including planning, thereby helping to
reduce unwanted pregnancies, abortions, and deaths and injuries to
countless mothers around the world," she said.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. leadership has always been critical to the success of
global efforts in the population field," she said. "The United
States played a key role in the creation of the UNFPA 30 years ago,
and was a central player in shaping the historic consensus at the
1994 International Conference on Population and Development in
Cairo. Through USAID, it is the largest bilateral supporter of
reproductive health and population programs."
</P>
<P>
The UNFPA's work is guided by the Cairo agreement, which called
on governments to provide universal access to reproductive health
care by 2015 as a global human rights imperative.
</P>
<P>
The Conference recognized that meeting individual needs in this
regard, enabling couples to choose the number and spacing of their
children, would lead to smaller families and early stabilization
of population growth.
</P>
<P>
The UNFPA, wholly funded by voluntary contribution, is the
largest international funded source of population assistance to
developing countries. The Fund helps countries improve
reproductive health and family planning services on the basis of
individual choice, and to formulate population policies that
support sustainable development and poverty eradication.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Failed to Bring WTO Leaders to Seattle, Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has quietly tried, but failed, to persuade leaders of major World
Trade Organization (WTO) members to attend a meeting in Seattle to
launch a new round of trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported Wednesday that Clinton's concerns
were underscored when negotiators for the 135 members that will
attend the Seattle meeting abandoned their effort in Geneva to
work out an agenda.
</P>
<P>
"Their failure calls into question whether Clinton can achieve
many of his negotiating priorities," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The third ministerial meeting of the WTO, which is to be
convened from November 30 to December 5, is expected to launch a
new round of trade talks, or the Millennium Round, to further
liberalize international trade.
</P>
<P>
The White House on Tuesday gave up on its last-minute attempt
to persuade the leaders of Japan, Brazil, the European Union and
several developing countries to attend the meeting after several
leaders said they had scheduling conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The inability of the trade negotiators to reach an agreement on
the agenda after weeks of trying in Geneva reflects fundamental
disagreements on some of the most politically sensitive economic
issues around the globe.
</P>
<P>
The United States wants Europe to abandon its huge subsidies
for farmers, which it believes are protectionist measures intended
to cripple more efficient American producers.
</P>
<P>
The European Union and Japan refused the demand by the U.S.,
saying that any trade accord must include the question of
protecting rural communities -- a code-word for protecting the
livelihoods of the farmers who live in those nations.
</P>
<P>
Several times during the last few weeks, Clinton and his staff
have tried to get some of those political bosses, whether
presidents or prime ministers, to Seattle, hoping that the
pressure of gathering them in one place would force several
nations to compromise, The New York Times said.
</P>
<P>
But for weeks the White House got tangled up in the questions
of whom to invite, compiling lists and then abandoning them, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
"Every time we put together a list of names," a White House
aide said, "it became clear that we would make 20 enemies," it
added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's top aides informally contacted Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi, South African President Thabo Mbeki,
Brazilian President Fernando Cardoso and Australian Prime Minister
John Howard and a small number of others.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted several officials as saying that the one
leader most interested in attending was the one Clinton would not
talk to: President Fedel Castro of Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Wednesday met in a closed-door session to discuss the
current situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a U.N.
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Fred Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, told a press conference that
during the informal consultation, some Council members have
circulated a draft resolution that would authorize U.N.Secretary-
General Kofi Annan to equip 500 military observer, with a view to
future deployment.
</P>
<P>
Annan, in his latest report to the 15-nation Security Council,
recommended the deployment of 500 military observers to monitor
the peace process after the July signing of the Lusaka peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, the U.N. Observer Mission in Congo (K) began
dispatching military liaison officers in the wake of the
successful completion of the technical assessment of five
locations across the country, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Four officers arrived in Gbadolite on Wednesday afternoon, and
another team of four should be leaving for Kananga, a government-
held town, on Thursday, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the U.N. Technical Survey Team had visited five
locations in Congo (K), starting with Gbadolite, and then moving
on to Goma, Kisangani, Bukavu and Kanaga. At each location, they
met with local authorities as well as representatives of U.N.
agencies and non-governmental organizations. The team completed
its work on Friday last week.
</P>
<P>
Annan last Thursday named Kamel Morjane, Tunisia's ambassador
to the United Nations in Geneva, as his special representative in
Congo (K), a job that would have him overseeing a possible
deployment of U.N. peacekeepers to monitor the faltering ceasefire
in the many-sided conflicts.

U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said the permanent representative
of Iraq to the United Nations met the Office of the Iraq Program
Tuesday and told them that Iraq was prepared to continue with the
oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said the last loading of Iraqi ships under the current
oil-for-food deal was scheduled to have taken place Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Iraq informed the United Nations Last Saturday that it would
not sign the two-week extension of the current oil-for-food
program authorized by the United Nations Security Council last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said the two-week extension is meaningless.
</P>
<P>
President of the Security Council for the current month Danilo
Turk was told Tuesday that Iraq had said it would accept a new
phase of the rollover the program.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council is expected to take vote on it next week.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food program, which began to be implemented in late
1996, is aimed to ease the deteriorating humanitarian situation in
Iraq caused by the stringent U.N. sanctions against the country.

BEIRUT -- Lebanon's public debt is expected to rise to 22
billion U.S. dollars this year, accounting for 130 percent of its

Banks in Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan President Invites Saddam Hussein to Caracas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new invitation was delivered by Venezuelan Minister of
Energy and Mines Ali Rodriguez, who ends a two-day visit to Iraq
Wednesday, according to reports reaching here from Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The first invitation from the Venezuelan president to Saddam to
assist the summit was delivered about two months ago by the
Venezuelan embassy in Iraq to the authorities of the country.
</P>
<P>
Although Saddam Hussein is willing to attend the summit,
according to the official news agency of Iraq, INA, the
authorities are refusing the invitation due to the difficult
situation within the country at the present time.
</P>
<P>
The next OPEC summit will be held on the 40th anniversary of
the initiation of the organization.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez and his counterpart from Iraq, Amer Mohamed Rasher,
examined cooperation between their two countries in the fields of
petroleum and economy as well as their respective countries'
positions with regard to the summit in March.
</P>
<P>
International oil prices have gone up due to Iraq's
announcement that they will suspend the export of crude in line
with the United Nations Organization's food for petroleum program,
which Iraq describes as "sinister."
</P>
<P>
The crude price, which reached its lowest level last year,
began to rise again after the petrol producing countries agreed to
reduce oil production by 2.1 million barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
Various producer countries have expressed their wishes to
extend the agreement until June.

<HEADLINE> Albright Says Deal on Paying U.N. Dues Dissatisfied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said Wednesday that the Clinton administration
remains "deeply dissatisfied" with the deal between the
administration and the Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the White House and Congress reached an
agreement to pay 926 million U.S. dollars that the U.S. owes in
dues to the United Nations, but with conditions including
prohibiting U.S. funding to pro-abortion family-planning
institutions.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, a controlling minority of legislators insisted
that these U.N. arrears payments and the president's international
debt relief initiative be linked to restrictions on our support
for international family planning," Albright told reporters at the
State Department.
</P>
<P>
"This was by far the most painful and difficult part of the
negotiating process," she added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. owes the United Nations about 1.6 billion U.S. dollars,
according to the statistics of the world body. It will lose its
rights to vote in the General Assembly if it fails to pay off some
of the debt.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans demanded the U.N. reduce the U.S. shares of the
U.N. regular budget from 25 to 22 percent and fees for peace-
keeping operations from 31 percent to 25 percent. They also linked
the issue with anti-abortion activities.
</P>
<P>
"For three years we fought as hard as we could to break this
linkage, and we made our case repeatedly to Congress and to the
public that it is unwise, illogical, and wrong to hold our
obligations to the United Nations hostage to an extremist agenda
on international family planning," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
In the end, the administration faced a "no-win choice" between
protecting the U.S. national security interests at the U.N. and
maintaining full support for programs that help save women's lives,
she added.
</P>
<P>
"Under the circumstances, we achieved the best settlement
possible. We did all we could to minimize the negative impacts of
the language that was approved," she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright has been criticized by the pro-abortion woman
activists and organizations for the deal on paying U.N. dues.
</P>
<P>
Albright stressed that "the administration remains deeply
dissatisfied with the need to accept any linkage even for a single
year." "Our commitment to free speech and international family
planning is as strong as ever," she added.
</P>
<P>
In next year's budget, President Bill Clinton will request an
appropriation of 541.6 million U.S. dollars, a return to the 1995
levels, to international family planning programs, she said.
</P>
<P>
"I give notice now that I will fight hard for that request and
to see that the restrictions in this year's appropriations bill
expire, as scheduled, next September," she affirmed.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Enlarge Spending to Enhance Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian government is to expand
its spending next year in a bid to jump-start its stalemate
economy, according to a budget address President Olusegun
Obasanjo Wednesday delivered to the country's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
The new budget will have a deficit of 82.7 billion naira (about
920 million US dollar) in its proposed total spending of 470
billion naira (about 4.95 billion dollar) in the coming year,
said the president at a joint session of the National Assembly in
the country's capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
The deficit, said Obasanjo, represents 2.2 percent of the
country's Gross Domestic Products (GDP) and is "intended to
reflate the economy and create the required atmosphere for growth
and development."
</P>
<P>
On next year's fiscal policy, the president said priority
sectors like oil and gas, export processing zones, solid
minerals, and agriculture will receive increased fiscal
incentives.
</P>
<P>
Recurrent expenditure takes up about 300 billion (3.16 billion
dollar) of the total spending and the rest would go to capital
expenditure, the president told the legislators.
</P>
<P>
The spending is 129.4 billion more than that of 1999 for the
government' s increased income due to reasons including the rising
price of oil.
</P>
<P>
The proposed new budget was made basing on an oil price of 18
US dollar per barrel, said Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,260 billion naira (13.26 billion dollar), reflecting a
27.9 percent increase over last year would accrue to the
government with the oil sector, which accounts most of the
country's income expected to provide 1014 billion naira (10.67
billion dollar) of the amount.
</P>
<P>
On the recovery of looted money, Obasanjo said that his
government had recovered more than 120 million US dollar stolen
by past military regimes and had frozen a further 600 million in
foreign bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
Recovering the billions spirited away during 15 years of
corrupt military misrule has been one of Obasanjo's priorities
since taking office as an elected president in May.
</P>
<P>
"Some of our efforts abroad have been impeded by complex legal
 procedures, which tend to make recovery of our stolen assets not
too easy," said Obasanjo in his 2000 budget speech.
</P>
<P>
"However, a number of foreign governments and institutions have
been particularly helpful. We will not relent in our efforts
until we have achieved significant success in getting back all
that is recoverable," he added.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Vice President Joseph Stiglitz to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- World Bank Chief Economist
and Senior Vice President Joseph Stiglitz will leave the bank at
the end of the year to return to research and teaching, the World
Bank announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Stiglitz came to the World Bank as chief economist in February
1997 after a distinguished career in academia and as chairman of
the U.S. government's Council of Economic Advisors.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Stiglitz's departure, World Bank President James
D. Wolfensohn said that Stiglitz "has an extraordinary mind."
</P>
<P>
He said that Stiglitz has contributed greatly to the endeavor "
designed to move us closer to our clients, away from the so-called
Washington Consensus, and to apply a comprehensive approach to
development putting social justice, equity and the fight against
poverty at the heart of the bank's agenda."
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn said he has asked Stiglitz to remain as a special
adviser to him and to head the search committee which will look
for a successor. Stiglitz has agreed to do both jobs.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the World Bank said that Stiglitz has made a
major contribution to the bank's research and operational agenda:
opening up several new and important areas of research; critically
re-examining the role of the State; emphasizing the centrality of
knowledge and information in development; and producing a thorough
assessment of the forces of globalization, urbanization and
localization, the main backdrop of global economic activity at the
end of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
"His work has also focused on a re-examination of the economies
of transition and of the policy responses to the East Asian Crisis,
" the bank said. "In both cases, Joe has been an important and
strong voice for the interests of the developing countries and
especially for the poor," Wolfensohn said.

PANAMA CITY, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank will
provide 22.6 million dollars to develop an ecological culture in
Panama, according to a statement from the National Authority of
the Environment (ANAM) made public Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ANAM, which this week presented their financial budget for
the year 2000 to the Panamanian Legislative Assembly, said that
this financing would also help achieve sustainable human
development.
</P>
<P>
According to Ricardo Barranco, director of the ANAM, to achieve
the evolution of the organic structure of this dependency, it will
be necessary to implement a national environmental program to be
carried out by way of the financial and technical help of the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Among the new plans for the ecological program, there is the
protection of the environmental quality, planned to regulate the
use of treated water and the complete economic activities of the
country.

NAIROBI, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese top legislator Li

Environment Program (UNEP) and the U.N. Center for Human

</P>
<P>
Li, Chairman of the Standing Committee of National People's
Congress, held talks with Shafqat Kakakhel, UNEP deputy executive
director, and Daniel Biau, UNCHS deputy executive director.
</P>
<P>
Kakakhel said UNEP and China have had very good cooperation in
various areas of environmental protection and are working closely
in the protection of climate, biodiversity and oceans, and
prevention and mitigation of floods among others.
</P>
<P>
He also highly spoke of China's impressive achievements made in
the environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Biau said that in recent years, UNCHS and China have conducted
 cooperation in the fields of public information and control of
natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
Li, who arrived here Monday for a four-day official goodwill
visit to Kenya, said the protection of environment has been one of

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Leader Says No "Secret Agreement" on N.Irish Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams
reaffirmed his party's commitment to the Northern Ireland peace
process on Wednesday and insisted that there is no "secret deals"
behind the Good Friday Agreement on Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
"There is no hidden agenda and this party's public position is
also its private position," he said in his first address to his
party since the end of the review, concluded last week.
</P>
<P>
"Let me assure you all that there is no secret deal," he told
about 100 party members gathered at a Dublin hotel.
</P>
<P>
The 11-week review, chaired by former U.S. senator George
Mitchell, delivered a peace formula aimed at ending 30 years of
sectarian violence in the British-ruled province.
</P>
<P>
"Our immediate goal is to forge a partnership with unionism
that will see us labor together with the new institutions and
govern in fairness and in honesty, with justice and equality,"
Adams said, adding that he wanted to see an historic compromise
between nationalists and unionism.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of decommissioning of guerrilla weapons, Adams
said this would be addressed by the independent disarmament
commission, headed by Canadian General John de Chastelain.
</P>
<P>
"The Good Friday agreement makes it clear that this issue can
only be resolved in the context of an overall settlement, "he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Irish Republican Army's (IRA) proposal last week that it
would appoint a representative to start talks with the commission
was a sign of its "willingness to enhance the search for a
democratic peace settlement", he said.
</P>
<P>
Adams also repeated his assurance that top party officials Pat
Doherty and Martin Ferris remained committed to the peace process,
and that without them there would not have been one.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Opposition Governors March Against New Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Opposition governors and
mayors of the Venezuelan government Wednesday marched through the
streets of the capital against the new Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The marchers left the Plaza Morelos and walked in an orderly
manner to the Legislative Palace, where the National
Constitutional Assembly was being held.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports, around 3,000 people took part
in the march, organized by the Association of Venezuela's
Governors and Mayors, in support of the "Rejection" of the new
Constitution in the referendum planned for December 15.
</P>
<P>
The governors have questioned the Magna Carta because they
consider it as a proposal of a centralist state.
</P>
<P>
This march by the governors and mayors forms part of a wave of
protest from various sectors of the country against the government
of President Hugo Chavez.
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, students attempting to march from the Liceo
Fermin Toro to the Education Ministry in the capital were stopped
by police using tear gas. Four people were injured.
</P>
<P>
The students were marching for further state funding for the
educational institution and against the tuition payments.
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional Assembly presented the final text of the new
charter last Friday. It extends the presidential term to six years
from five, allows presidents to run for reelection once,
eliminates the Senate to create a one-chamber parliament and
enshrines state ownership of the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
While praised for improving civil rights and punishing
corruption, it has also called for removing congressional veto of
military promotions and changing the country's official name to
the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
The document will be put to a referendum on Dec.15 in the world

A modest gain by the U.S. Dow Jones Industrial Average and
strong performance of media stock helped boost the FTSE 100 index.

The worst faller was Electronics Boutique - shares tumbled 41
percent, down 32.25p to 45p, after profit warnings.

The FTSE Eruotop 300, a broader measure of the largest pan-
European stocks, closed up 0.3 percent as media stocks provided
the main buying focus.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Xetra DAX index ended steady as gains by takeover
target Mannesmann AG were countered by nervousness about banks'

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
keeping an eye on Iran's parliamentary elections next February so
that it could see if there is any sign of change in Iranian policy,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to have elections in February in Iran, which we
think will be very important and will, I think, give a signal as
to the direction in which Iran wants to move," Albright said at a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to figure out a way to build on the
possibilities of a people-to-people program. There have been some
Iranians that have come to the United States.... And we wanted to
be able to improve the ability of Americans to go to Iran, which
is one reason that we had been talking about having some American
consular officers visit there," she said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has long been seeking possibilities for
American consular officials to visit Iran, but its proposal was
flatly rejected by Iranian leaders.
</P>
<P>
The United States is now offering an unconditional dialogue in
which both sides could bring up its grievances. It wants to talk
about weapons programs, support for groups like Hizbollah in
Lebanon and Iranian opposition to Middle East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
But Iran says the United States should unfreeze Iranian assets
and lift sanctions before the dialogue begins.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Indian farmers and ranchers
Wednesday charged the U.S. Agriculture Department with a 20-year
history of discrimination against them in the granting of loans.
</P>
<P>
The 213 Indians, who filed the 19 billion dollars class-action
lawsuit with the U.S. District Court, contend that they were told
loans were not available when they were.
</P>
<P>
They alleged that loans were delayed until it was too late to
raise their crops or that the approved loans would be less than
requested, causing financial and property losses.
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs also argued that in some instances they had to
put up more collateral than their white counterparts, limiting
their ability to obtain future loans.
</P>
<P>
What the government has done to the Indian farmers and ranchers
is "a national disgrace," said Alexander Pires, the lead attorney.
</P>
<P>
Tex Hall, an Indian rancher in North Dakota, said in a
statement that the lawsuit "is the result of decades of
discrimination by the Farm Services Agency and its predecessors
against the original indigenous people of this land."
</P>
<P>
"As indigenous people, we are the first farmers and ranchers of
this land," he said. "All we wanted is a fair chance to become
successful."
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman "is deeply committed to
native American civil rights and in serving native Americans,"
said department spokeswoman Susan McAvoy. "He is very concerned
about the lawsuit."

<HEADLINE> World Bank Helps Vietnam Protect Coastal Wetlands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced
Wednesday the approval of a credit of 31.8 million U.S. dollars to
Vietnam to re-establish the coastal mangroves of the Mekong Delta
and improve the livelihoods of up to 600,000 poor people.
</P>
<P>
The coastal wetlands protection and development project will be
implemented in the southern Mekong Delta provinces of Ca Mau, Bac
Lieu, Soc Trang and Tra Vinh, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
During the six-year implementation period, the project will
link environmental conservation with poverty alleviation in the
project area. Accordingly, the project will restore coastal
mangroves in a full protection zone and support diversified and
sustainable farming techniques in an adjacent buffer zone, while
limiting economic activities and coastal developments that are
threats to the mangroves.
</P>
<P>
"By restoring the mangroves, reducing encroachment, and
providing options for stable income generation in the vicinity,
this project will help preserve a vital natural resource that
provides protection from coastal storms, conserves biodiversity
and revitalizes habitats for commercially important aquatic
species," said agricultural ecologist Ronald Zweig, the project's
task team leader.
</P>
<P>
Application of appropriate management of mangrove forests will
also sustainably provide wood products from thinning activities as
well as a range of food and household items such as roof thatching
material, medicinal plants, and honey.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government is targeting agricultural
productivity and coastal resource management as part of its recent
rural development strategy.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador's Guagua Pichincha Volcano Erupts Twice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Two more explosions of Ecuador's
Guagua Pichincha sent ash and water vapor up into the atmosphere
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Geophysical Institute of the National Polytechnic School (
IGEPN) confirmed that the volcanic explosions were registered at
midday and 12:40 p.m., local time.
</P>
<P>
According to the first reports from the IGEPN, the mushroom
cloud of ash and water vapor produced by the volcano reached an
altitude of between 6,000 and 12,000 meters, and was then blown to
the west of Quito by local winds.
</P>
<P>
A little after the explosion, the traffic situation in Quito
became chaotic due to people observing the natural phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The specialists from the IGEPN said that the latest explosion
of the volcano, situated 10 kilometers to the west of Quito,
showed that it has now resumed full activity.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that Wednesday's explosion was relatively strong
and accompanied by loud bangs.
</P>
<P>
Due to the unusual behavior of Guagua Pichincha, at 4,794
meters above sea level, there is a Yellow alert in the capital,
while in the town of Lloa and other populated areas close to the
volcano, an Orange alert is being maintained.
</P>
<P>
The authorities of the National Civil Defense, and of the
capital, said that adults as well as children should take
necessary precautions in the case of ash raining down on them,
which means wearing a face mask, eye protection, a moistened
handkerchief and the carrying of a bottle of water.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Confident New Round Trade Talks Be Launched in Seattle1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration
officials on Wednesday said they are confident that a new round of
trade talks, the Millennium Round, will be launched at the Seattle
ministerial conference of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
"We are looking forward to a very important and useful
conference in Seattle. We have -- the president is fully
committed to an agenda which allows us to move forward with very
important WTO initiatives in the next round," Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright told reporters at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
After three months of talks, trade representatives from WTO
members failed on Tuesday to reach agreement on the agenda for the
next round of trade talks and they left the heavy task to their
ministers who are to meet in Seattle between November 30 to
December 5.
</P>
<P>
"We have found in WTO negotiations generally that there are
lots of valleys and peaks, and the president is committed to
having a very robust and good session in Seattle," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters at the White House, U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky said she was highly confident
the meeting will succeed in launching the new round of trade talks.
</P>
<P>
"The key goal here is a successful launch of the new round of
global trade negotiations. As you know, the president, at the end
of his first year, closed the Uruguay round. And now, at the
beginning of his last year, he will preside over the opening of a
new global round of trade talks," Barshefsky said.
</P>
<P>
"The key here is manageability of the round. A three-year
time frame is the consensus time frame already agreed upon in
Geneva. And we want to be sure, however, that the round meets
standards of success that are important to the U.S.," she added.
</P>
<P>
"At the end, it will all come together because it has to come
together...Everyone knows that failure is not an option...It will
all come together, I have a very high degree of confidence in that,
" she said.
</P>
<P>
She also outlined four goals of the United States for the new
round of talks, including trade barriers reduction, integration of
the least developed countries into world trade system, high tech
trade and the quality of life.
</P>
<P>
"On the quality of life issues, the question of labor and
environment, we put a very high priority for progress in these
areas," she explained.

<HEADLINE> British, Franch Leaders Discuss British Beef Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, French President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin on Thursday discussed the issue of British beef in their
summit held in London.
</P>
<P>
"Beef will come up at some point today," a spokesman for Blair
told reporters. But he stressed that the beef issue "is by no
means topping the agenda."
</P>
<P>
He said the discussions will mainly focus on defense and
France's continuing ban on British beef was far from the key issue.
</P>
<P>
British Agriculture Minister Nick Brown said on Wednesday that
there had been "real progress" in the talks between the two
countries in resolving the beef row and he expected to see the
resumption of beef exports into France in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The two countries on Tuesday agreed a "protocol of
understanding" on five key issues concerning British beef and
France submitted the protocol to its food safety agency for
reference.
</P>
<P>
But there was still no firm date for resuming British exports.
</P>
<P>
France and Germany are the only EU states which have not yet
complied with an EU ruling to end the ban imposed in 1996 during a
crisis over BSE, or mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
Conservatives in Britain have strongly criticized that Blair's
government had made a damaging concession to France when it agreed
last week to label British beef in the European market.

<HEADLINE> Clashes Erupt Over bin Laden in Afghanistan: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Clashes have broken out
between the supporters and opponents of the indicted terrorist
Osama bin Laden in the northern Afghan province of Takhar, the
Afghan Islamic Press (AIP) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that there has been sporadic exchange of fire
since Wednesday in a Taliban-controlled area near the provincial
capital of Taloqan as a result of a recent religious decree of the
anti-Taliban Islamic scholars that calls for bin Laden's
execution.
</P>
<P>
Some local fighters were opposing the decree for "the reason
that Osama bin Laden had aided Afghans against Soviet aggression,"
said the Pakistan-based news agency.
</P>
<P>
It reported that three persons were killed and four others
injured in the clashes over the past two days. "The fighting is
not fierce but the situation is very tense in the area some nine
kilometers east of Taloqan city," it said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. sanctions have been imposed on the Taliban militia for
their refusal to hand over bin Laden to Washington, which accused
the Saudi dissident of involvement in the bombings of its
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August last year.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Govt Urges Full Use of Whole-Day School Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region's Secretary for Education and Manpower
Joseph W P Wong said Thursday that the whole-day primary schools
should make full use of their additional resources.
</P>
<P>
"The whole-day primary schooling is much better than bi-
sessional operation because it will provide a quality learning and
teaching environment conducive to an all-round education for the
students," Wong said at the opening ceremony of the Leung Sing
Tak Primary School in Tseung Kwan O.
</P>
<P>
"As the government is pressing ahead with the implementation of
whole-day primary schooling, some whole-day schools still stick to
practices of a bi-sessional school and do not provide enough
opportunities for students to participate in extra-curricular
activities," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Most primary schools in Hong Kong operate bi-sessionally, but
the government aims to implement whole-day primary schooling
progressively.
</P>
<P>
Wong said that providing quality education is one of the Hong
Kong government's major policy objectives, with the implementation
of whole-day primary schooling being a key element.
</P>
<P>
"The government aims to provide whole-day schooling to 60
percent of our primary students by September 2002 and to enable
virtually all primary students to study in whole-day schools by
September 2007," he said.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this target, the government will have to build about
120 new schools at a total cost of 12 billion HK dollars (1.5
billion U.S. dollars), with an additional recurrent cost rising to
2.3 billion HK dollars (295 million U.S. dollars) per year.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 255 public sector primary schools
operating as whole-day schools in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Wong said the Education Department would provide advice and
assistance to schools having difficulties in implementing whole-
day schooling.
</P>
<P>
"If there is still no improvement, the school management
committee should explain to the public and be held accountable,"
he stressed.

<HEADLINE> China Cracks Down on Share-holding Company Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- China has exposed rampant
corruption in a share-holding company in Heilongjiang Province in
China's northeast, harshly dealing with company management
personnel and government officials involved.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the Chinese Communist Party Central
Commission for Discipline and the Ministry of Supervision, the
Daqing Lianyi Share-holding Company was found to be fraudulent.
Many were found to make bogus listings on the stock exchange and
engage in nefarious activities such as embezzlement and bribery.
</P>
<P>
Xue Yonglin, chairman of the board of directors of the Daqing
Lianyi company, set up the petrochemical joint stock company in
1996, giving away 941,500 stocks and 10.94 million yuan of premium
funds to some organizations and individuals.
</P>
<P>
Xue and other senior management personnel were also accused of
embezzlement and misappropriating public funds. Xue has been
expelled from the Chinese Communist Party and removed from his
post of vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the Daqing City
People's Congress. He is yet to face the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Others staff of the company, including Xue Yugui, chairman of
the board of supervisors, were sentenced to three and up to eleven
years of imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The report said that 17 bureau-level and 44 county level
officials accepted stock-related bribes or bought stocks after
being told of guaranteed profits.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Urges Pak to Adhere to Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee Thursday urged Pakistan to adhere to the Simla
accord and Lahore declaration.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference in Lucknow of Uttar Pradesh that
Pakistan's intrusion into Kargil was in clear violation of the
Simla accord and Lahore declaration and this created a "crisis of
faith" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Now it is entirely up to Pakistan to establish its credibility
and show commitment for the two agreements before starting any
fresh dialogue with India," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the increase in cross-border terrorism in the Kashmir
valley after the military takeover in Pakistan clearly indicated
that Islamabad was not interested in talks and was only indulging
in "false propaganda."
</P>
<P>
"If Pakistan is really interested in fruitful and friendly
dialogue with India, it would have to create a conducive
atmosphere by adhering to the Simla accord and Lahore
declaration," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ruling out any fresh accord with the new Pakistan regime, he
said, "We do not believe in entering into new agreements and keep
on ignoring the existing ones."
</P>
<P>
According to the Simla accord signed by the two countries in
1972, both sides should respect the Line of Control in Jammu and
Kashmir following the cease-fire on December 17, 1971.
</P>
<P>
The Lahore declaration, signed by Vajpayee and deposed Pakistan
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in February this year, began a new
peaceful process between the two countries.

<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Zongye, a 64-year-old
research fellow at the High Energy Physics Institute says that age
is not an issue at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), China's
highest institution of learning.
</P>
<P>
Zhang is one of two female CAS academicians elected this year.
"I want to continue my work in physics which I love. Since an
academic can apply for research funds and take in postgraduate
students anytime before the age of 80, I will be able to continue
my work after the retirement age of 65."
</P>
<P>
Zhang was elected because of her outstanding achievements in
nuclear theoretical physics.
</P>
<P>
Born in Beijing in 1935, Zhang fell in love with physics some
50 years ago when she was a high school student. Her brother,
Zhang Zongsui -- two years her senior -- was an expert in
theoretical physics. Influenced by her brother, Zongye decided to
spend her life in the study of theoretical physics.
</P>
<P>
She graduated from the Department of Physics at Peking
University in 1956 and became a student of the famous scientist Yu
Min at the CAS High Energy Physics Institute.
</P>
<P>
"I have been very lucky both in terms of family and career".
Zhang married her college sweetheart Yu Youwen. They now work in
the same research department.
</P>
<P>
"He has given me a lot of support and shares the household
chores."

"Being elected as an academician shows that people recognize my
work over many years. This is what an intellectual worker
treasures most," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot work as much as I did when I was young," Zhang said,
"but I can still manage five to six hours of work a day."
</P>
<P>
Zhang goes to her laboratory every morning and works at home in
the afternoon. She liked to be with young people at the institute,
because it makes her happy and energetic.
</P>
<P>
"It's a worry, however, that it becomes increasingly difficult
to recruit good postgraduate students. Some of my best students
have gone abroad or changed their areas of research," adding that
low pay may partly explain the lack of good postgraduate students.
</P>
<P>
Zhang has worked in an institute in Germany for several times.
She pinpointed differences and gaps in research methodologies in
China and overseas. At times, Chinese researchers cannot do their
work wholeheartedly because there are many distractions. For
example, fierce competition for the allocation of fund and
academic positions as well as inadequate living and working
conditions.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Winds Up Housing Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 25 (Xinhua) -- An official of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) said here Thursday that the
government is faced with many challenges including housing in
meeting the increasing aspirations of the growing population.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Hong Kong Housing Conference 1999, which closed
here Thursday, Secretary for Housing Dominic Wong said however
that there must be a cautious and realistic approach to standards
and costs.
</P>
<P>
Officiating at the closing ceremony of the conference, Wong
said, "This is particularly true of the environment, where we need
a strategy which allows for maximization of housing production
without compromising the quality of our urban way of life."
</P>
<P>
"This requires imaginative and innovative approaches to
building design as well as more flexible and imaginative town
planning. It is also a good opportunity for all of us to reassess
the respective roles of the public and the private sectors in the
provision of housing," he said.
</P>
<P>
With the theme of "Better Homes in the Next Millennium," the
two-day conference was attended by some 500 delegates, who are
housing-related professionals, academics, policy makers and
representatives of concerned groups from Hong Kong, the Chinese
mainland, other parts of the Asia-Pacific region and Europe.

BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Following are the highlights
of diplomatic news released by Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Meets Thai Senate Speaker
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin, in a meeting today with Meechai
Ruechupan, speaker of the Senate of Thailand, said that the two
countries enjoy close relations and no unsolved problems exist
between them.
</P>
<P>
Arms Control Official on Theater Missile Defensive (TMD)
</P>
<P>
China does not reject the whole concept of TMD, an official
with the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a recent interview with
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
China understands the role of TMD in protecting stationed
troops and what China opposes is the advanced TMD system which
could be employed during National Missile Defensive, Sha Zukang,
director of the Arms Control Department of the Foreign Ministry,
said, adding that this will undermine a strategic balance.
</P>
<P>
He also called the U.S. threat to retreat from the Anti-
Ballistic Missile (ABM) a heavy blow against the international non-
proliferation efforts, saying now that countries without nuclear
weapons have initially joined in the NPT with the basic
understanding that nuclear disarmament will continue until nuclear
arms are destroyed.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. action will probably give rise to another nuclear
arms race and lead to nuclear proliferation, which will greatly
hinder the international efforts to end nuclear proliferation,"
Sha said, pointing out that the U.S. attempt to modify the ABM and
establish a missile defensive system will eventually cause an arms
race in space, which is in no one's interest.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated China's stance on complete prohibition and
thorough destruction of nuclear weapons and called on countries
concerned to give up their efforts in developing and deploying
missile defense systems.

<HEADLINE> Iran Cracks down on Clandestine Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Intelligence Ministry
on Thursday said that it has cracked down a clandestine religious
group known as "Mahdaviat" and arrested all its 34 members.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the ministry said that the group had planned to
assassinate Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, Chairman of the
State Expediency Council Hashemi Rafsanjani and former Judiciary
Chief Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi.
</P>
<P>
However, 20 members of the group have been freed after
"undergoing judicial procedures," the Islamic Republic News Agency
quoted the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
But the ministry did not mention when the group members were
arrested. It said that the leader of the Mahdaviat was a "deviate
cleric" living in Mashhad, northeastern Khorasan province since
1976, who had penal records at the Special Clerical Court and
completed theological studies abroad.
</P>
<P>
Without revealing the name of the cleric, it said that the
group aimed at misuse the spiritual sentiments of Muslim people
and attract different people by relying on forged titles and the
false claim that he had special links with the 12th Shiite Imam
Mahdi and receiving orders from him.
</P>
<P>
The group had robbed 53 weapons and considerable amount of
ammunition on five separate occasions from several bases of Basij
(mobilization volunteers) forces in the second half of last
Iranian calendar year (ended March 20, 1999), the ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Falls Ill With Bronchitis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
was diagnosed as suffering from a viral infection accompanied by
bronchitis, a Kremlin aide said Thursday, quoting doctors of the
Central Clinical Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's health had appeared to improve in recent weeks and
had been fairly active. He went to Istanbul, Turkey last week to
attend the summit of the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe, delivering a forceful rebuff to Western pressure on
Russia to ease its military campaign against rebels in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
According to his spokesman Vladimir Yakushkin, Yeltsin "felt
not so good" after a two-hour meeting in the Kremlin with top
aides on the war in Chechnya and a union treaty with neighboring
Belarus.
</P>
<P>
A visit by Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko to Moscow,
originally scheduled for Friday for the signing ceremony of the
treaty, has been postponed to the next month.
</P>
<P>
Yakushkin said Yeltsin traveled on from the Central Clinical
Hospital to his Gorky-9 residence outside Moscow, where he will
receive further treatment for his malaise.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, 68, was last hospitalized in October 9 for an
influenza and fever.
</P>
<P>
The president has had health problems for years, including a
heart trouble that led to multiple bypass surgery in 1996 and
recurring bouts of pneumonia and respiratory infections. He has
also suffered from back pain and a recurring ulcer in the past
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese young women
shuttlers proved too powerful be beat as they clinched more than
half of the semi-final berths Thursday at the 30,000 U.S.-dollar
Hong Kong Open Badminton Championships.
</P>
<P>
Three out of four Chinese women single players, together with
two double pairs, sailed into the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
In the women's singles, 16-year-old up-rising star Wei Yan of
China completely dominated a tie against 20-year-old Indonesian
Marfuah Yuli, second seed and semi-finalist at 1999 Indonesia Open,
winning 11-2, 11-9 in just 21 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"Wei played better today," said the Indonesian number-four
player. "I was not in the form."
</P>
<P>
Wei, who gunned down World Grand Prix champion Zhang Ning of
China to enter the quarter-finals, is to meet her compatriot Xie
xinfang in the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Xie saw off out fourth seed Koon Wai-Chee of Hong Kong, China
with a win of 11-7, 11-9.
</P>
<P>
World junior runner-up Hu Ting of China, who upset top seed
Chan Ya-Lin of Chinese Taipei Wednesday, took up a very hard fight
against Thai Sathinee Chankrachangwong 11-8, 11-6. She will take
on third seed Ling Wan-Ting of Hong Kong, China, in the semi-final.
</P>
<P>
Ling outclassed Chinese Dong Fang 11-4 and 11-9, claiming her
second straight victory over the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
China's Chen Ling/Jiang xuelian and Lu Ying/Huang Sui, top two
seeds in the women's doubles, meet little problems to reach the
semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
In the men's singles, unseeded Hariyanto Agus and third seed
Tam Kai-Chuen, both from Hong Kong, China, entered the semi-finals
by trouncing Lee Hyun Ii of South Korea and Bjorn Joppien of
Germany in straight sets respectively.
</P>
<P>
The results surprised host head coach Chan Chi-Choi.
</P>
<P>
"I'm delighted with my players performance in this tournament,"
Chan said.
</P>
<P>
Second seed Chinese Chen Wei had to try hard to race past
Indonesia-born Ronald Susilo of Singapore 15-9, 15-12.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's Irwansyah was too much experienced for Chinese Cai
Yun, beating the Chinese giant killer, who ousted top seed Rio
Suryana of Australia Wednesday, 15-3, 15-7.
</P>
<P>
Irwansyah will meet Tam Kai-Chuen while Chen Wei face Agus in

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper "
People's Daily" will carry a commentary tomorrow, titled "Exposing
and Fighting Falun Gong to the End", calling on people to maintain
a vigilant eye against the Falun Gong Cult.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says that a number of facts unequivocally reveal
that Falun Gong is not an organization of qigong practitioners,
but an illegal organization with political motives that seriously
undermines the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the government.
</P>
<P>
The facts exposed the true nature of Falun Gong as a cult
opposed to science, humanity, society and the government.
</P>
<P>
From the very beginning, Falun Gong leaders have instigated and
misled a number of Falun Gong practitioners to attack the Party
and government institutions, as well as media units, seriously
endangering Chinese society.
</P>
<P>
The commentary stresses that the fight against Falun Gong is a
serious ideological and political struggle which is closely linked
to the future and fate of China and the Party. Anyone
underestimating the seriousness and complexity of the fight and
struggle to contain and eliminate the cult will lead to historical
mistakes and criminal offenses.

The commentary says that the nationwide fight against Falun
Gong has won a decisive victory with the cult being banned and the
majority of its practitioners waking up to their errors.
</P>
<P>
However, the article admonishes the people to remain on their
guard as there are still a handful of crazy cult practitioners.
</P>
<P>
All evidence indicates that Li Hongzhi and his followers will
not stop their illegal activities. The fight against Falun Gong is
thus a long-term and arduous struggle.
</P>
<P>
Painstaking efforts must therefore be made to keep blind
followers at bay from Falun Gong's pernicious influence. The cult
also has anti-China forces overseas in an attempt to oppose the
Chinese government, the commentary notes.

<HEADLINE> China Predicts Steady Economic Growth in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- China's economy is expected to
grow steadily in the coming year, with a 7.6 percent growth rate
in Gross Domestic Product (GDP), according to a report released
today by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS).
</P>
<P>
There will be more emphasis on developing China's western
regions next year. The private sector will have more opportunities
to develop due to improvements in China's infrastructure, says the
report by a panel of CASS experts.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the report notes, China's township enterprises, a
major contributor to China's economic growth, were booming, but in
recent years the situation has changed. According to the report,
there are encouraging signs that China's township enterprises are
now making a comeback.
</P>
<P>
The report states that science and technology will play a more
active role in China's economic development in the coming year.
China's efforts to expand its domestic consumption and improve its
market environment will also have a positive influence on economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate in China's foreign trade volume has began to
increase. In the first three quarters, more than 53 million
overseas tourists visited China, producing 10 billion U.S. dollars
of foreign exchange for China's tourism, up 14.64 percent from
last year. This trend is predicted to continue next year.
</P>
<P>
The report also says that as long as China is not beset with
natural disasters, its agriculture sector will continue smoothly
in the coming year.

<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wu
Bangguo today urged governments at all levels to support logistics
development with preferential policies on fund use and planning.
</P>
<P>
Wu said this in a speech at an international convention on
logistics development held here today.
</P>
<P>
He noted that modern logistics, with advanced management style,
will help generate high profit. He predicted that logistics will
become a driving force for the economic development in China in
the future.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC) to
join other departments in working out policies to promote the
rapid development of the sector.
</P>
<P>
With the improvement of technology and strengthened internal
management, there is a less possibility for industrial firms to
further narrow down costs within the area of production, said Shi
Wanpeng, Vice-Minister of the SETC.
</P>
<P>
Shi added that potential exists outside the area of production,
such as in purchasing, transport, and warehousing.
</P>
<P>
Shi admitted that China is still at the initial stage of modern
logistics development, with outstanding problems in traditional
ideas and extensive management expertise.
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar was co-sponsored by the SETC and the World
Bank, which attracted nearly 500 officials, entrepreneurs and
experts from China and overseas.

<HEADLINE> Northeast Capital Suffers Massive Power Blackout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Power was cut off when a main transformer in a power substation
which generates one-fourth of the city's entire power supply,
exploded, resulting in more than 150 short circuits which ripped
through 29 high-tension cables throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
The local electricity administration is repairing the damaged
transformer. If successful, the power supply should be back to
normal tonight.
</P>
<P>
Nearly one-fifth of this city was affected by the power
blackout.
</P>
<P>
Rain and later sleet covered the city's 66,000-voltage high-
tension cables. Power was cut in office buildings of local TV
stations, newspaper offices, some hospitals, and Taoxian
International Airport, the largest airport in northeastern China,
which canceled all its 27 flights on Wednesday due to heavy snow
and the power blackout.
</P>
<P>
Power supplies were limited in some households near the city.
Water supplies and heating systems were affected. Local
temperatures in Shenyang were 17 to 10 degrees blow zero (Celsius).
</P>
<P>
Coal mines were advised to cease underground mining immediately
to avoid possible disasters. A stock exchange was temporarily
halted before a generator was put into operation.
</P>
<P>
The sudden power cut took the Shenyang branch of the Bank of
China more than one hour to restart its computer systems. Some
foreign remittance and exchange businesses were suspended for
several hours.
</P>
<P>
A Siberian cold front brought heavy snow Wednesday to northeast
China. Jilin, Liaoning's neighboring province, was forced to close
its airport at noon on the same day.

Russia, Alrosa produces 20 percent of the total diamond output in
the world, with the annual value of 1.5 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Cites Need for Easier Health Care for Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Thursday stressed the need to re-engineer the national
health system to give the poor easier access to health services
and shift attention to preventive rather than curative care.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered for him by First Lady Luisa Estrada at
the 50th Annual National Convention and Golden Anniversary of the
Philippine Hospital Association (PHA) here, the president noted
that many countries are recasting their health structures to meet
the goal of "health for all" and define primary health care as the
route to it.
</P>
<P>
"Under this administration, all components of the health sector
including the vital contribution of hospitals should be integrated
by expanding the coverage and improving the quality of health
services to every Filipino, particularly the disadvantaged segment
of our society," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
As nerve centers of health care delivery, Estrada said,
hospitals can make a significant impact in addressing these
concerns especially if they can expand their services to include
the promotive, and rehabilitative aspects of health care.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, the government has to take steps to
heed the people's need for affordable health services that are not
only accessible to every Filipino but designed as well to match
the economic realities of the country.
</P>
<P>
He called on hospitals to adopt a more comprehensive quality
health care that concentrates on basic health service delivery.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Thai Senate Speaker (More Added) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
met here today with Meechai Ruechupan, speaker of the Senate of
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Calling Meechai "an old friend of the Chinese people," Jiang

</P>
<P>
China and Thailand enjoy a close relationship and no unsolved
problems exist between the two countries, Jiang noted.

<HEADLINE> China Reiterates Call for Ban, Destruction of Nuclear Arms (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- China today reiterated its
stance on complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear
weapons and called for countries concerned to give up the effort
in developing and deploying missile defense systems.
</P>
<P>
Sha Zukang, China's chief arms control official and head of the
arms control department of the Foreign Ministry, made the
statement in an interview with Xinhua here today.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Qian Qichen made clear the stance of China's on
the issue of nuclear weapons at the 1994 United Nations Assembly,
Sha said.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who was then also Foreign Minister, pointed out in his UN
address that China supports the adoption of a convention on the
comprehensive ban of nuclear weapons through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Since the international community has comprehensively
prohibited biological and chemical weapons, there is simply no
reason not to do the same with nuclear weapons, which have greater
destructive force, Sha quoted Qian as saying.

<HEADLINE> China Reiterates Call for Ban, Destruction of Nuclear Arms (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to Sha, the United States and Russia, with the world'
s top two nuclear arsenals, should take the lead in implementing
the package of strategic arms control treaties they have signed,
and continue to negotiate for treaties for further strategic arms
control so as to create favorable conditions for other nuclear
countries to join in the process of nuclear reduction as early as
possible.
</P>
<P>
The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is a key
prerequisite for the smooth running of nuclear reduction, and the
international community should work together to ensure its
implementation, Sha said.
</P>
<P>
Developing and deploying the National Missile Defense (NMD)
system and the Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system will alter the
strategic balance and runs counter to nuclear arms control and non-
proliferation, noted Sha, who urged countries that are doing so to
abolish such plans.
</P>
<P>
NMD and TMD will become unnecessary when the goal of nuclear
weapons destruction is realized, he said.
</P>
<P>
Before the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of
nuclear weapons can be completed, Sha said, nuclear-weapon states
should undertake unconditionally not to be the first to use
nuclear weapons, and not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons
against non-nuclear-weapon states and regions.
</P>
<P>
These are the fundamental and most important measures to
establish trust, and are enormously good for the nuclear reduction
process and non-proliferation efforts, he said.

<HEADLINE> China Steps Up Efforts to Cut Ozone-Depleting Chemicals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- China has stepped up its
efforts to cut production and consumption of ozone-depleting
substances (ODS) in a bid to protect the ozone layer and fulfill
its international obligations.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jirong, vice-director of the State Environmental
Protection Administration of China (SEPA), announced here today
the Chinese government approved earlier this month the revised
edition of China's National Action Agenda to phase out ODS, issued
six years ago, in order to quicken its pace of the phase-out.
</P>
<P>
Under the revised edition, which is subject to technical and
financial support, some industries will phase out some ODS far
ahead of the deadline set in the previous action agenda.
</P>
<P>
China's firefighting departments will stop production and
consumption of Halon1211 by 2006, six years ahead of the original
deadline.
</P>
<P>
Auto air-conditioning industry will stop using CFCs-12 by 2001,
nine years ahead of the deadline set by the Montreal Protocol on
Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer.
</P>
<P>
China has cut ODS output and consumption by a total of 50,000
tons since 1991, thanks to the financial support from a
multilateral international fund and efforts made by the Chinese
government and 200 enterprises involved in the work.
</P>
<P>
According to another senior environmental protection official,
in the past few years China has received a total of 445 million U.
S. dollars in donations from a multilateral international fund for
programs to protect the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
The fund was set up by developed countries from the Parties to
the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer
to help developing countries phase out ODS production and
consumption over a set period.
</P>
<P>
An additional 500 million U.S. dollars will be needed for China
's phase-out action agenda in the next decade.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Peres Meet to Discuss Regional Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
on Thursday met with Israeli Minister of Regional Cooperation
Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Peres were to discuss the Arab-Israeli peace talks
and issues related to regional economic cooperation, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Peres arrived in Cairo earlier for a day-long visit. "Egypt is
the leader of the region" and plays a key role "in the political
and economic fields and the reactivation of the peace march," MENA
quoted him as saying upon arrival.
</P>
<P>
Peres, a former Israeli prime minister, has a strong belief
that permanent peace can be realized in the Middle East through
substantial economic cooperation between the Arab world and
Israel. He took the current post in July in a bid to forge ahead
with the idea.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, however, opposes Arab-Israeli cooperation before any
breakthrough is made in the peace process, especially in
Palestinian-Israeli talks and a resumption of the Syrian-Israeli
negotiations on the return of the Golan Heights Israel captured in
the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Peres, who has close relationship with Mubarak, is expected to
persuade the Egyptian leader to ease the position on Israel's
much-hoped-for regional cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Uganda, Rwanda Army Chiefs Meet Over Congo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I am having a delegation from Kigali and we are discussing the
 cooperation between the armed forces between the two countries in
the DRC issue," Ugandan Army Commander Jeje Odongo told Xinhua in
a telephone interview Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
"This is just a follow-up of the summit meeting of the heads of
state in Uganda's southwestern district of Kabale on November 8,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The commander, however, denied that they would discuss issues
concerning the Mai Mai rebels in the DRC who killed a senior
Ugandan officer in Beni on November 14.
</P>
<P>
Barigye Bahoku, press assistant to State Minister for Defense
Steven Kavuma, also confirmed the meeting in Bombo. He said he did
not know how long the closed-door meeting would last, but the
further cooperation between the two countries in the DRC would be
likely to top the agenda.
</P>
<P>
The seven-man Rwandan delegation, led by Rwandan Patriotic
Army Chief of Staff Kayumba Nyamwasa, arrived at the Bombo
barracks earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda sent troops into the DRC to allegedly
protect their borders from being attacked by the DRC-based
elements hostile to their respective governments. Their strategic
differences grew following the split of the main rebel group, the
Rally for Congolese Democracy, in May this year. The armed clashes
between the two countries' forces in Kisangani in August have
brought their relations to an all-time low.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has since met his Rwandan
counterparts to massage the bruised relationship and ordered a
complete inquiry into the Kisangani shoot-out. Military delegates
from both sides have also been contacting each other to revitalize
their strained relationship.

<HEADLINE> Britain, France to Seek Closer Defense Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain and France are expected
to consider on Thursday the creation of a European rapid reaction
force to deal with conflicts like Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
At the summit in London, British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and French President Jacques
Chirac will discuss the possibility of a new defense deal.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will share same personnel and equipment, and
soldiers from one country could come under the day-to-day command
of officers from the other.
</P>
<P>
But the British government denied that the move will undermine
NATO and lead the United States to feel uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
Hours before the summit begin, British Defense Secretary Geoff
Hoon insisted that the United States would support closer European
integration on defense.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. policy supports the development of a European security
and defense identity," he said.
</P>
<P>
"What we are working for is a more effective European
contribution to NATO. We learned in Kosovo of the inability of
European nations to get sufficient forces into the field
sufficiently quickly," Hoon said.
</P>
<P>
"What we want to see is a much stronger European contribution
to NATO strengthening the way NATO does its business," the defense
secretary said.
</P>
<P>
Hoon also denied Britain was being "dragged along" by France
towards an anti-American policy.
</P>
<P>
"It is perfectly possible, arising out of much closer military
arrangements between the UK and France, certainly in a European
context, that we can draw France closer to NATO," he said.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Orders Probe Into Helicopter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has ordered a comprehensive probe into a helicopter
scandal and asked the Ministry of Defense to have all officers
involved to account for their actions.
</P>
<P>
Army Commander Jeje Odongo was directed to check with State
Minister for Defense Steven Kavuma on the progress of the inquiry
into the junk Mi- 24 helicopter scandal, a senior military
official who prefers anonymity told Xinhua Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Museveni had earlier ordered for an internal inquiry into the
matter and asked the Defense Ministry to go through the court
process to recover the money that had been spent on the
unoverhauled planes.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the Ugandan army purchased four helicopters from
Belarus via Consolidated Sales Corporation, a British Virginia
registered company, at a total sum of 12.9 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
After the payment of an initial 6.5 million U.S. dollars, two
helicopters were supplied by Belarus, but were rejected because
they were found not airworthy. Meanwhile, the cost of each
helicopter was also found to have been inflated by nearly 1.5
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said that there was corruption in the deal and
fingers were pointed at several top amy and Defense Ministry
officials including Museveni's brother Salim Saleh, former senior
presidential advisor on defense and internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
After the scandal became public, Museveni ordered a probe into
the deal.
</P>
<P>
The initial inquiry comprised Kavuma, Deputy Chief of Military
Intelligence Noble Mayombo and Secretary for Defense Ben Mbonye.
</P>
<P>
The team recommended that the helicopters, now grounded at the
Old Airport at Entebbe, be returned to Belarus at the cost of the
supplier. But the supplier failed to comply. In September, Kavuma
told the parliamentary committee on defense and internal affairs
that the government had terminated the contract and instructed the
Attorney General to take legal action.

<HEADLINE> Railway Sector to be Profitable by Diversifying Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- China's railway sector expects
to become profitable by further developing subsidiary sectors,
including real estate, tourism and construction.
</P>
<P>
At a recent work conference, Sheng Guangzu, vice minister of
railways, said that the measure will help optimize the original
structure and improve the sector's efficiency.
</P>
<P>
China's railway sector, long operated in the planned economy,
has suffered heavy losses since 1994, with the total loss hitting
15.6 billion yuan in 1997, according to Sheng.
</P>
<P>
Sheng said the country's railway departments plan to set up a
nationwide cargo transport service network, taking advantage of
the current railway network.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more railway tour routes will be added, he said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Indian Minister Asks for More Defense Allocation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Indian Defense Minister
George Fernandes Thursday suggested that defense allocation be
raised from 2.3 percent to 3 percent of the gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the Coast Guard commanders' conference, he said
that while it is difficult for him to say whether this level could
be achieved by next year, he would be pursuing the objective of
mobilizing more resources for defense.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the shortage of funds for defense during the last
decade, he said the recent Kargil conflict had created an
awareness among the people about security concerns.
</P>
<P>
"This needs to be used to make people realize that their role
is important as of men in uniform," he added.

<HEADLINE> Somalia Issues Decree Concerning Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The regional government in
Somalia's northeastern towns known as Puntland has issued a strong
decree concerning both the local and international media operating
in the areas under its control.
</P>
<P>
The administration has since last year been having difficulties
with the local media making extensive coverage irritating the
regional government.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement also ratified by the legislators of
Puntland, all media personnel can only exercise their businesses
under the full authority and permission of the Puntland
administration.
</P>
<P>
All local press personnel should have identity cards issued by
the Ministry of Information of Puntland and pay 100 U.S. dollars
to have a license, the decree said.
</P>
<P>
The decree demanded the international media representatives
operating in the region to register themselves in the Ministry of
Information and pay 100 U.S. dollars for having a permission.
</P>
<P>
All press personnel who might defy such orders would face
serious punitive measures under the penal codes of Puntland, the
statement warned.
</P>
<P>
The regional government of Puntland had arrested three local
journalists since the beginning of the year for what is called a
misconduct of their work in the journalism field.
</P>
<P>
The editor of Mandeq paper from Garoweh town and two others
from the Yol paper of Bossaso were detained for publishing
articles said to be against the administration of Puntland.
</P>
<P>
However, all three journalists have been released separately
under the pressure mounted from their respective clan and subclan
elders in the region.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of People Drafted for Shipwreck Rescue in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Several thousand soldiers and
local residents have been drafted to help rescue passengers and
crew from a shipwreck near the coastal city of Yantai in east
China.
</P>
<P>
At least 104 of the 312 passengers and crew on board the ship
Dashun have been reported dead. At press time, 36 people who had
fallen from the ship into the cold sea had been rescued.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has dispatched soldiers, police and
navy troops for the rescue effort. Fishing boats, rescue ships and
navy vessels have been sent to the site.
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 people from 16 coastal villages continue to
search along a 45 km long stretch of coast in hopes of finding
survivors.
</P>
<P>
This morning a helicopter was sent to scout the sea area for
bodies and debris floating near the wreckage, but rough waters
have prevented clear visibility. A strong gale in the area has
produced waves up to 4-5 meters high.
</P>
<P>
The ship, belonging to a Shandong company, was forced to turn
back due to the gale-force winds and huge waves Wednesday
afternoon as it headed for the port of Dalian in northeast China's
Liaoning Province. The vessel sent out distress signals when
flames were discovered at 4:30 p.m. on the second deck.
</P>
<P>
No ships in the area were able to get close enough to help the
Dashun because of the strong wind and waves.
</P>
<P>
The ship's helm apparently failed to work at 8:15 p.m.
Wednesday, sending the ship adrift. The low temperature, around
zero degrees Celsius, and the continuous high wind made rescue
operations difficult.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire is still under investigation.

<HEADLINE> HK Police endeavor to Fight Cyber Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong police are
devoting resources to deal with the ever-increasing computer-
related crimes, Chief Superintendent of Police's Commercial Crime
Bureau (CCB) Lo Yik-kee said today.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the media on the latest computer crime situation, Lo
said that the number of cyber crime cases reported was 228 so far
this year while there were only 34 reported cases in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 228 cases, 160 were on hacking, 31 on publication of
obscene articles, four on criminal damage in relation to data and
14 on Internet shopping fraud.
</P>
<P>
Lo pointed out that the tremendous growth of technology and the
rapid expansion in the use of Internet had provided users with
access to information but at the same time opportunities for
criminals.
</P>
<P>
"To broaden police capability to cope with the increasing
demand in investigations, we endeavor to develop investigation
skills, exchange information with overseas law enforcement
agencies and liaise with local information technology
professionals," Lo said.
</P>
<P>
"As part of the efforts to broaden capability, a Computer Crime
Investigation Cadre (CCIC) will start to function in December," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Comprising more than 80 officers of different ranks drawn from
various formations, the CCIC will provide support services to
front-line operational units at district levels.
</P>
<P>
"Under the existing legislation, the maximum penalty to be
imposed on offenders of computer-related crimes is a fine of one
million HK dollars or 10 years imprisonment," Lo warned.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Reaffirms Stance on KR Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian government
insisted Thursday that any trial of former Khmer Rouge (KR)
leaders must respect Cambodia's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia will never be "a sovereign state" if the Khmer Rouge
trial is dominated by foreign countries, Sok An, minister of the
Council of Ministers and head of Cambodia's task force on the
Khmer Rouge trial, stressed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a National Assembly session, he said the Khmer
Rouge trial will be conducted in a domestic court with
international participation and U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
has agreed to abandon his demand for an international tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Om Yin Tieng, senior advisor to Prime Minister Hun Sen, told
reporters after the session that a draft law on the trial of
former Khmer Rouge leaders will be ready early next month and
expected to get recommendation from the United Nations before
being presented to the National Assembly for a public debate in
December.
</P>
<P>
The advisor emphasized that the Khmer Rouge trial is to bury
Cambodia's past and laws are to be used to close this page.
</P>
<P>
Om Yin Tieng repeated Prime Minister Hun Sen's recent statement
that the trial will likely be held as scheduled in March next
year.
</P>
<P>
So far, France, India and Russia have sent their legal experts
here to help Cambodia with its laws for a Khmer Rouge trial. They
have already held separate consultations with the government task
force on the Khmer Rouge trial.

PARIS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- French President Jacques Chirac, Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin and British Prime Minister Tony Blair will discuss on
Thursday in London the British proposal of establishing a European
rapid reaction force, which will be capable of intervening in
crisis in Europe while being autonomous of NATO. The idea, first
presented at the previous French-British summit in Saint-Malo last
year, was reinforced by the Kosovo War, which showed the weakness
of European defense capacity in comparison with the United States.
</P>
<P>
-- France and Britain are expected to solve their dispute over
British beef, after the two governments and the European Union (EU)
presented on Wednesday a document on new measures of control to
the French food health authority, the AFSSA. The new measures
include banning of beef products from all British cattle farms
which have discovered a case of mad cow disease since 1996 and a
closer supervision on British cattle farms by the EU.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The French government has blocked a move by the American
Coca-Cola soft drink producer to take over the French company
Orangina, which produces juice drink. Minister of Economy
Christian Sautter said that such a move would result in a monopoly
by the American company in French soft drink market, where Coca-
Cola and its affiliate drink Fanta and Sprite already have 60
percent of consumers.
</P>
<P>
-- Michele Alliot-Marie, a parliament deputy from the southwest
Pyrennees-Atlantiques region, has become the most hopeful winner
in the race for the chairmanship of the Gaullist movement Rally
for the Republic which will elect its new chief in 10 days, after
some other candidates quit.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Won't Compromise in Seattle: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will not
compromise on issues of direct concern to developing countries and
on positions where they stand to lose rather than benefit in the
World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
In making clear Malaysia's stand, Minister of International
Trade and Industry Rafidah Aziz said that as far as developing
countries were concerned, any agenda for trade talks under the WTO
must be balanced, Malaysian national news agency Bernama reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We have said from the very beginning that we must have a
balanced agenda," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Even if there is no conclusion or decision made in Seattle, so
let it be. To us, the Seattle meeting can go without a
resolution," she said when commenting on reports that Malaysia was
among several of the most determined countries which were
threatening to boycott the next round of WTO trade talks in
Seattle until they had felt more of the benefits of the last
round.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah said the focus in Seattle, among other things, should
be on implementation issues (of the last round) where there was
still wide dissatisfaction, on the built-in agenda as well as on
the inclusion of industrial tariffs which had been agreed to and
agriculture, which was an outstanding issue.
</P>
<P>
"We are not concerned whether we reach anything in Seattle as
far as Malaysia is concerned," she said.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah said "all the extraneous issues that have been
eliminated from the WTO ambit or jurisdiction should not come
back again."
</P>
<P>
"Also, in Seattle, Malaysia together with like-minded
developing and developed countries, will reject any position that
includes any extraneous issues or that erodes into the interests
of developing countries," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
"If we want to discuss a new round, then the new items on the
agenda must reflect the balanced interest of developed and
developing countries," she added.
</P>
<P>
She said that developing countries had put forward some common
issues, which they wanted to see being debated, including issues
on anti-dumping and export subsidies.
</P>
<P>
"We also reject any attempt for the WTO to intrude into the
sovereign rights of countries to determine domestic policies that
are not trade distortive," the minister said.

JERUSALEM, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>

changes introduced into the law will cut costs to the state.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Arab Israeli Knesset members accused police of using

<HEADLINE> Arms Control Official Decries U.S. Senate Rejection of CTBT (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua)-- China is gravely disappointed
with the U.S. Senate's rejection of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test
Ban Treaty (CTBT), said Sha Zukang, head of the arms control
department of the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Sha said that the rejection is so
bad which will have a far-reaching negative impact.
</P>
<P>
First, the Senate's denial of the treaty blocks the CTBT from
coming into effect, Sha said.
</P>
<P>
Without the approval of the United States, the largest and the
most advanced nuclear arsenal with the heaviest record of nuclear
testing in history among the world's 44 countries with nuclear
capacities, the CTBT has no hope of ever coming into effect, he
said, branding the act as a blow to the international will to
permanently ban nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
"It seems as if the U.S. was negotiating the treaty for the
sake of someone else," by eagerly promoting it and then later
dismissing it, Sha said.
</P>
<P>
"It's the typical practice of the U.S.: sign the treaty first
and then have reservations on key decisions, just as it did with
the convention on the prohibition of the development, production,
stockpiling and use of chemical weapons and their destruction," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Such deeds will leave psychological and political scars on
nations concerned, and threaten ongoing and future CTBT
negotiations, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"It needs to be pointed out that superpower though it may be,
the U.S. is not supposed to possess super rights. All nations are
equal," Sha said.

GENEVA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Men's World Cup downhill and
super-G races will be held as planned date but at Lake Louise,
Alberta, on December 4 and 5, announced the International Ski
Federation (FIS) in Oberhofen of Switzerland on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
FIS had to change the location for the season's first North
American races when temperatures in Park City, Utah, proved too
warm to make sufficient artificial snow.
</P>
<P>
The women's giant slalom and slalom races were staged at Copper
Mountain, Colorado, and two men's races originally scheduled for
Park City were moved to Beaver Creek, Colorado.
</P>
<P>
A women's downhill and super-G this Saturday and Sunday at Lake

<HEADLINE> Arms Control Official Decries U.S. Senate Rejection of CTBT (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The two reasons specified by the U.S. Senate for voting down
the CTBT are groundless, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Sha dismissed the Senate's claim that the treaty lacks a strict
and substantial watchdog mechanism, calling it an empty excuse
that can not ensure all parties involved in the negotiations for
the CTBT to strictly implement it.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, he argued, the CTBT contains a very rigid
review procedure and measures.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the gentlemen of the Senate drew their conclusions
after serious study of the text itself," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Senate's other reason was that the prohibition of nuclear
testing undermines the safety and dependability of its arsenal and
risks U.S. security and interests. Sha said this is "a dangerous
signal that the U.S. will continue nuclear tests."
</P>
<P>
"Although the U.S. government makes the commitment to continue
to abide by the CTBT, the stance of the Senate raises doubts about
its credibility," Sha said. "The fact that a country with the
highest number of nuclear tests in history would not stop testing
gives other countries reason to follow suit."
</P>
<P>
The CTBT, which would prohibit all nuclear-capable countries
from developing nuclear weapons in quality, is for the security
interests of the international community including the United
States, and is also a crucial step toward comprehensively banning
and completely eliminating nuclear weapons, Sha concluded.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. Senate's rejection of the CTBT is a serious obstacle
to the goal, obstructs the arms control process, and negatively
affects international nuclear non-proliferation efforts," Sha said.

China has been actively engaged in the negotiations for CTBT, and
is among the first countries to sign the treaty.
</P>

The treaty is currently awaiting ratification by the National
People's Congress (NPC), Sha said, adding that the U.S. Senate's
rejection of CTBT would not affect China's stance.
</P>
<P>
"China's determination to get CTBT ratified remains unmoved,"
he said.

<P>
"China solemnly vows not to carry out any nuclear tests before
ratifying the CTBT, and to honor all obligations under it after
its ratification," Sha stated.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has pledged to push the ratification
process forward, but it is up to the NPC to decide whether or not
and when to ratify the treaty, Sha explained.
</P>
<P>
"The NPC will make its decision after careful study of the text
and a thorough deliberation of the current international security
situations," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Sha pointed out, paragraph II, article IX of the
treaty, which states that "each State Party shall, in exercising
its national sovereignty, have the right to withdraw from this
Treaty, if it decides that extraordinary events related to the
subject matter of this Treaty have jeopardized its supreme
interests," applies to all state parties.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt to Ban Unnecessary Foreign Travel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
determined to cut the projected budget deficit for next year in a
bid to enforce the ban on unnecessary foreign travels, a senior
official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press forum here, Press Secretary Rodolfo Reyes
said the deficit for next year will be reduced from 96 billion
pesos (2.4 billion U.S. dollars) to 85 billion pesos (2.1 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Reyes said even President Estrada himself will limit his
foreign trips to international gatherings which require the
presence of the Philippine head of state and cancel other visits
abroad.
</P>
<P>
"I think the president would want to set the example on this,"
Reyes said, referring to the president's determination to keep the
budget deficit at a manageable level to ensure that the economy
stays in good condition.
</P>
<P>
According to Reyes, an order has already been issued by
Estrada, barring government officials and employees from going on
unnecessary travel abroad at the expense of taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
However, the ban does not include international functions that
require the presence of representatives from the country,
including those organized by groups affiliated with the United
Nations, he added.
</P>
<P>
The government will also suspend the hiring of new employees,
which he claimed is expected to increase the savings of the
Executive Department, which could effectively mean a lower budget
deficit.
</P>
<P>
But he was quick to add that the freeze-hiring policy would
not cover new teachers since the country needs them to be able to
provide better quality education.

<HEADLINE> China to Put Silver Trade in Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- China has put the Huatong
Nonferrous Metal Trading Center Wholesale Market in charge of the
country's silver trade, an official from the State Economic and
Trade Commission (SETC) said today.
</P>
<P>
No other markets are allowed to operate silver trade without
permission, except for trading of silver coins and silver products,
said Xiang Xin, vice-director of the trade and market department
under the SETC.
</P>
<P>
Xiang noted that the silver trading market will be run on a
trial basis before December 31, and during the period the People's
Bank of China will go on buying and sell some silver in a unified
way.
</P>
<P>
After January 1, 2000, the trading market will run full-scale,
and all the unified purchase and sale of silver will be abolished,
said Xiang.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai-based Huatong was opened in September 1998 by the
members of China Huatong Materials Group.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the People's Bank of China released a notice
to ease management on silver and allowed silver to be traded on
open market.
</P>
<P>
Xiang said that silver is a precious metal and its open trading
should be put in good order. In the first stage, the trading will
only be made on the spot and no futures business is allowed.
</P>
<P>
He also defined the traders as silver manufacturers, silver
users, circulating firms, commercial banks, and the People's Bank
of China and its designated units.
</P>
<P>
After the opening of the silver market, the policy of exempting
value-added taxes on silver manufacturers and funds appropriated
for use by them will be abolished, said Xiang, adding that the
country will encourage the export of silver and limit the import.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Protests to U.N. Over Fresh Turkish Incursion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has protested to the
United Nations over a fresh Turkish troops incursion of northern
Iraq, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Mohammad Said al-Sahaf has demanded in a
letter that the U.N. pressure the Turkish government to abide by
the U.N. Charter and international law and pull out its troops
from northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sahaf said Turkish troops recently carried out a new round of
aggression in northern Iraq, where a 20-tank-strong force
penetrated deep into areas of Batoufa and Kani Masi.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Turkey massed up an additional force on
borders in preparation for entering into the Iraqi territories
with the aim of launching a wide-scale aggression, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sahaf called upon Turkey to refrain from repeating such acts
which infringed on bilateral relations, international law and the
U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
The aggression had caused heavy casualties and property damages
on the Iraqi Kurdish citizens, said the letter.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq utterly rejects all pretexts Turkey has used to justify
its aggression," which was allegedly aimed at "cracking down
elements threatening security of Turkey," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Such an aggressive policy went against Turkey's claims that it
is keen on maintaining Iraq's sovereignty and territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
After the 1991 Gulf War, Baghdad lost its control over the
northern Kurdish autonomous region. Turkish troops often carried
out cross-border attacks against rebels of its outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party who have sought shelter there.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has the right to demand compensation for the damage caused
by the aggression, and urged the U.N. to live up to its
responsibilities and stop such aggressive acts, said the letter.

<HEADLINE> Downsizing of Provincial Government A Focus for Next Year: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Downsizing of China's
provincial government will become a focus of the current
institutional reform in China, said a report recently finished by
a research group with the China Academy of Social Sciences, the
top think tank of the country.
</P>
<P>
The report, titled "China's Social Situation Analysis and
Prediction," said that the downsizing and restructuring at the
central government level has proved successful, forming a model
for similar work at the provincial level.
</P>
<P>
"Institutional reform at the provincial level will face even
more difficulties," the report said. "It will need firm
determination and careful operation."
</P>
<P>
Besides government organizations, other public institutions
like research institutes will also need to deepen their reform
next year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
For these institutions, the main purpose of reform is not
downsizing and restructuring, but improving their competitiveness
in a market economy, it said.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Turkish Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are the major
news items in leading Turkish newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Radikal (Radical):
</P>
<P>
-- "The ruling of the European Human Rights Court may be waited
for" on the death sentence on Kurdish Workers' Party leader
Abdullah Ocalan, said Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit.
</P>
<P>
His words came amid signs that the final execution may be
postponed.
</P>
<P>
However, "If Turkey's Europe Union candidacy is confirmed,
European criterion may be implemented on the execution," said a
foreign ministry spokesman. European countries do not apply death
sentences.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- In a bid to persuade Greece to accept Turkey's candidacy to
the EU, the EU could reportedly insert statements in the Helsinki
Summit declaration which may accelerate Cyprus' membership efforts
or refer the Turkish-Greek problem to the Hague.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the Helsinki summit of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe scheduled for December 10, negotiations
on Turkey's candidacy are heating up. Greece stated that it would
not show its cards until the last minute due to mistrust in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Minister Georges Papandreau told his Turkish
counterpart Ismail Cem during an OSCE lunch in Istanbul last week
that "We don't trust Turkey. If you take a step reversing the
Turkish-Greek friendship after receiving candidacy, our government
will fall into a difficult position ahead of elections."
</P>
<P>
Cumhuriyet (Republic):
</P>
<P>
-- The United States has rejected Turkey's proposal on carrying
out activities against possible missile threats from the Middle
East countries with other NATO members, saying that it would be
"more useful" to be on bilateral level.
</P>
<P>
Within the framework of a project between the two countries,
three Turkish generals will attend a meeting in the U.S. in the
coming days on missiles.
</P>
<P>
A Turco-American working group to be set up after the meeting
will take part in a simulation conference to be held next year in
the U.S. to discuss measures against missile threats from the
Middle East region.

CAIRO, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Egyptian newspapers Thursday.

<HEADLINE> China's Reemployment for Laid-Offs Still A Problem: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Laid-off workers and their
reemployment remain top social problems in China in 1999 and the
coming year, according to a report just released by a research
group with the China Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The report said that in the first half of 1999, a total of 7.42
million workers were laid off from state-owned enterprises, and
only two million of them found new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Some 95 percent of these laid-off workers have registered with
employment centers and draw an average 170 yuan (20 U.S. dollars)
in monthly unemployment benefits, according to the country's basic
living guarantee, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Other job-related problems mentioned in the report include the
operation under capacity in quite a number of factories and the
underpayment of the workers.
</P>
<P>
It said that with China's industrial restructure and the reform
of state-owned enterprises, the number of laid-off workers will
increase, a situation which will continue to be closely watched by
both the government and society.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians May Declare State Before September: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
has said that the Palestinians may declare an independent state
before reaching a final peace deal with Israel by September 2000,
the Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The declaration of a Palestinian state depends on the
development of negotiations with Israel for a final peace
agreement, Palestinian Minister of Planning and International
Cooperation Nabil Sha'ath said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
If the two sides make substantial progress in the talks, the
Palestinians will not declare their state until they recuperate
lands occupied by Israel on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip,
Sha'ath said.
</P>
<P>
But should the final-status talks stumble, the Palestinians
would go ahead with the step before the planned deadline of
September 2000 and pursue struggle with the Israelis, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel began the final-status talks early
September to solve the thorniest issues including borders,
Jerusalem, refugees and Jewish settlements on the occupied
Palestinian territories. They have agreed to try to complete the
talks in a year.
</P>
<P>
"The competent party that has the right to declare officially a
Palestinian state is the Palestinian National Council" of the
Palestinian Liberation Organization, Sha'ath said.
</P>
<P>
The decision is "not linked with a final settlement," he added,
stressing that Israel will not be consulted on the move as it is
"a pure Palestinian matter of sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had originally planned to
declare an independent state last May when the five-year interim
period enshrined in the Oslo Accord expired. But he refrained from
taking the step to avoid complicating the then Israeli general
elections.
</P>
<P>
Israel has expressed readiness to see an independent
Palestinian state on the West Bank and Gaza Strip. But the Jewish
state wants it to be established after the two sides have reached
the final settlement.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Mission Aims at Improving Tokyo-Pyongyang Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 25 (Xinhua) -- A group of Japanese lawmakers
who will visit the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
agreed Thursday to aim at creating an environment for Tokyo and
Pyongyang to resume talks on normalizing ties, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The nonpartisan group, headed by former Japanese Prime Minister
Tomiichi Murayama, reached the agreement at its first meeting to
prepare for the December 1-3 visit, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, Murayama said, "It is Japan's
responsibility to make Asian nations coexist peacefully."
</P>
<P>
"If (the mission) goes successfully, it will become a force for
peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. I want it to
succeed with such thoughts," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, in a luncheon
speech in Tokyo, said he has strong interest (in the mission),
hoping that it will become a breakthrough toward normalization
talks between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The mission comprises 16 lawmakers from all major Japanese
political parties, including the ruling camp -- the Liberal
Democratic Party, the Liberal Party and the New Komeito party, as
well as the main opposition Democratic Party of Japan and the
Japanese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
Murayama, who formerly led the Social Democratic Party,
received an official invitation on November 15 from the Workers'
Party of the DPRK to visit Pyongyang.

<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Fu Quanyou, chief of the
General Staff of Chinese People's Liberation Army, said today that
China hopes to develop the army-to-army relationship with Hungary.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Kohalmi Alfred, deputy secretary of state of
the Hungarian Defense Ministry and head of the Defense Ministry
office, Fu said that Military ties between China and Hungary have
proceeded smoothly and fields for military cooperation have been
expanding.
</P>
<P>
Fu is also a member of the Central Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
Despite the changes in the international situation, China and
Hungary have maintained smooth and healthy relations, said Fu,
adding that the exchange of visits between the two head of states
has lent impetus to the development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Kohalmi said that there's no conflict of interest between the
two countries and their armies, and that the two armed forces
should strengthen exchange and cooperation.

BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Fu Quanyou, chief of the
General Staff of Chinese People's Liberation Army, met today with
Hoang Ky, commander of the third military area command of the
Vietnamese armed forces.
</P>
<P>
As China and Vietnam share a border, it is of practical and
historical importance to develop Sino-Vietnamese relations, said
Fu, also a member of the Central Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
Since the first three military area commands of the Vietnamese
armed forces border China on the south, the current visit will
help promote good-neighborly ties between troops in the bordering
regions and bilateral army relations as a whole, added Fu.
</P>
<P>
Hoang Ky said that he hoped to help increase friendship and
enhance exchanges between the two armies through the current visit,
and moreover learn from China's experience in building its army.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Appeals Court Upholds Ocalan's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Supreme Court of
Appeals on Thursday upheld the death sentence against imprisoned
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
The court ruling said that the June trial of Ocalan was fair
and thus rejected his appeal. Ocalan, captured by Turkish
commandos in Kenya in February, was sentenced to death by the
Turkish State Security Court in June for separatism and
insurrection.
</P>
<P>
But this does not mean the Kurdish rebel leader will be hanged,
as called for by the right-wingers in the coalition government.
The verdict must be endorsed by Turkish Parliament and President
Suleyman Demirel before an execution can take place.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan's lawyers said before the verdict was upheld that
should that decision be taken they would bring the case to the
European Court of Human Rights. The process is likely to take one
to two years.
</P>
<P>
The death sentence has been criticized by the European
countries which have abrogated the capital punishment. It is
believed that if Turkey insists on the execution of the sentence,
it would certainly harm Turkey's drive to join the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan led a separatist campaign in the largely Kurdish
southeast for at least 15 years. More than 37,000 people have been
killed in conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians Fail to Resolve Disputes Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators early Thursday again failed to resolve their disputes
over the maps of Israel's second-stage troops withdrawal from West
Bank land.
</P>
<P>
The latest session over the redeployment row was held in a
Jerusalem hotel Wednesday night and ran past midnight, according
to Israel Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian senior negotiator Saeb Erekat said after the
meeting that the Palestinians only demand Israel abide by the
Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum signed in September. He added that
there is no plan for a meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli chief negotiator Oded Eran said he hoped the
two sides will reach an agreement in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum, 2 percent of West Bank
land will be turned from Area B (joint Israeli-Palestinian
control with Palestinian civil administration) to Area A (full
Palestinian control) and another 3 percent from Area C (sole
Israeli control) to Area B by November 15.
</P>
<P>
But a dispute over the withdrawal maps has delayed the
scheduled pullback for more than a week, as the Palestinians
demanded the transfer of areas more densely populated than what
Israel had proposed.

<HEADLINE> CTBT Not to Affect Pak's Right to Conduct Tests: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Foreign Minister
Abdul Sattar Thursday said the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
(CTBT) will not affect Pakistan's "inherent right" to conduct more
nuclear tests if necessary.
</P>
<P>
"If India conducts another nuclear explosion before the CTBT
enters into force, nothing in or outside can foreclose Pakistan's
right to do the same, whether it has signed the treaty or not,"
Sattar said here at a seminar on Pakistan's response to Indian
nuclear doctrine.
</P>
<P>
After the treaty enters into force, India's more nuclear tests
will explode the treaty itself and, according to certain provision
of the treaty, Pakistan can withdraw form the treaty when such an
"extraordinary event" happens, he further stated.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said minimum nuclear deterrence will
remain the guiding principle of Pakistan's nuclear strategy, but
at the same time he hinted that the deterrence shall be
sufficient.
</P>
<P>
"The minimum cannot be quantified in static numbers. The Indian
build-up will necessitate review and reassessment," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"In order to ensure the survivability and credibility of the
deterrence Pakistan will have to maintain, preserve and upgrade
its capability," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Sattar reiterated that Pakistan will not engage in
nuclear competition or arms race with India. "The Chief Executive,
General Pervaiz Musharraf, declared on October 17 that his
government will pursue a policy of restraint and responsibility,"
he recalled.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the foreign minister said Pakistan is still in
favor of the CTBT, which it failed to sign, and will continue its
efforts for reducing nuclear dangers in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 44 states that possess nuclear weapons or have
nuclear plants, Pakistan is one of the only three countries that
haven't yet signed the treaty. The other two are India and North
Korea.
</P>
<P>
The treaty will take effect only after all the 44 countries
sign and ratify it. Twenty six countries have ratified the treaty
but the two main nuclear powers -- the United States and Russia --
have not.
</P>
<P>
"We did not sign the CTBT only because India's opposition to
the treaty raised suspicions about its intention," Sattar said,
adding that the apprehension proved to be correct by India's
nuclear tests in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Despite enormous pressure from the U.S. and other countries,
Pakistan conducted tests in the same month as a tit-for-tat
response to India's tests.
</P>
<P>
Deposed Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his Indian
counterpart Atal Bihari Vajpayee had both agreed to sign the CTBT
by September this year, but the collapse of the Vajpayee
government has made signing the treaty out of the agenda of both
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Congress of the United States vetoed the proposal of
ratifying the CTBT last month, which has further pushed the treaty
into a mare of uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
The new Pakistani government led by General Musharraf, who led
a coup on October 12 and dismissed the Sharif government, has no
intention to take a precipitate decision on the CTBT, Sattar
noted.
</P>
<P>
"On a policy issue as important as the CTBT, domestic consensus
is obviously a prerequisite," he added.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also disclosed that Pakistan has agreed to
participate in negotiations on the proposed Fissile Material
Cut-off Treaty (FMCT).
</P>
<P>
"Our predisposition is favorable" in regard with the FMCT, he
said.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Expects 2-3 Percent Growth in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Southeast Asian countries,
stricken hard by the financial crisis in 1997, are now expecting a
confidence-boosting growth rate of 2-3 percent for 1999.
</P>
<P>
Some countries of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) may even achieve growth rates as high as six
percent, the ASEAN finance ministers said in a joint statement
issued after their meeting here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN, which groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos,
Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam, had an overall economic contraction of seven percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
The development has restored investor confidence in ASEAN
economies as shown by the rebound of the stock markets across the
region and a rise in capital inflows, the finance ministers said.
</P>
<P>
They attributed the region's economic recovery to supportive
fiscal and monetary policies as well as corporate and financial
sector reforms.
</P>
<P>
Exports have also staged a turn-around due to the sustaining
growth in the United States, recovery in Japan, restoration of
exports financing and depreciating real exchange rates. The
expected rebound of the European Union economies and the increases
in oil prices are good news for ASEAN's exports, noted the
ministers.
</P>
<P>
However, ASEAN members are well aware of the risks and
challenges in their endeavor to "restore our position as one of
the world's fastest growing regions," since "the situation still
remains vulnerable."
</P>
<P>
If the U.S. growth slows down, or Japan fails to rebound,
ASEAN's export will be hit hard, the ministers said, urging the
industrialized Group-7 economies to pursue policies "that are
conducive to global financial stability and sustained global
demand."
</P>
<P>
To ensure a sustained recovery, ASEAN will begin the process of
fiscal consolidation and press on with structural reforms in
financial sector, corporate and debt structures, legal structures
and social safety, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN will also step up dialogs and collaboration with its East
Asian dialog partners, namely China, Japan and South Korea, on
monetary, fiscal and financial issues, the ministers said.
Besides, the reform of the international financial system is
another important work to ensure a sustained recovery in ASEAN,
they noted.

<HEADLINE> China's SOE Reform Enters New Stage: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The reform of China's state-
owned enterprises (SOEs) will enter a new stage and be at the
heart of the country's economic reform in the year 2000, according
to a report just released by a research group with the China
Academy of Social Sciences, the top think tank of the country.
</P>
<P>
"The reform will not have mainly individual enterprises in mind,
it will take the whole state-owned sector into consideration,"
said the report, titled "China's Social Situation Analysis and
Prediction."
</P>
<P>
There will be little room for state-owned enterprises to grow
if they are still based on the former economic system and
industrial structure, the report said, adding that to restructure,
optimize and upgrade the state-owned sector is the only way for
reform to succeed.
</P>
<P>
The new level of reform will require the country to further
open its thinking and make use of all possible resources to set up
a modern enterprise system and significantly improve management of
the state-owned companies, the report said.

<HEADLINE> China Faces Challenging Poverty Eradication Work: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- In the year 2000, China will
need to help at least 10 million people get out of poverty,
according to a report released by a group of socialists from the
China Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of 1999, China had some 20 million people
living in absolute poverty. This figure does not include those who
are disabled or those living in extremely poor remote mountain
areas, the report said.
</P>
<P>
These 20 million represent the biggest challenge to the
government in terms of poverty eradication, because both their
living and production conditions are extremely bad, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
In 1978 when China started its reform and opening-up drive,
about 250 million people lived in absolute poverty, or 30.7
percent of the total population at that time.
</P>
<P>
According to a schedule made by the Chinese government, China
is expected to basically eliminate poverty by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Pak to Protect Economic Interests at WTO: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has worked out a
comprehensive strategy to protect its long-term economic interests
at the forum of World Trade Organization (WTO), Commerce Minister
Abdul Razak Dawood said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with local press Thursday on the eve of his
departure for Seattle, Dawood said "our main concern is that WTO
does not imperil our long-term economic interests."
</P>
<P>
"The major areas of concern are agriculture, industry,
intellectual property rights, anti-dumping etc.," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan will definitely take up the issue of the quota
restrictions imposed by some developed countries, including the
United States, mainly on its textile exports.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister did not go into details of the
"comprehensive strategy."
</P>
<P>
The developing nations are working in close liaison to develop
a consensus-backed strategy to defend their interests, he said.
</P>
<P>
In this respect, they will be meeting two days ahead of the
formal session of the WTO to discuss plan that protects their
economy in the face of "openness" advocated by the developed
countries, Dawood said.
</P>
<P>
"The (WTO) meeting assumed more significance as the developing
countries are demanding extension or re-negotiation on the WTO
agreement, which is to be expired on December 31, 1999," he said,
adding that "the developed countries are, however, resisting to
this call."
</P>
<P>
"A comprehensive strategy is being worked out to propel the
sluggish exports regime that put emphasis on removing the
administrative and other bottlenecks," he added.
</P>
<P>
Dawood expressed the hope that a bumper harvest of cotton,
rice, onions, potatoes, etc., will help supplement government's
efforts in lifting the export quantum.
</P>
<P>
On the import side, he voiced concern over the flow of large
quantity of finished goods that causing the trade deficit to rise.

<HEADLINE> China Faces Uphill Battle for Sydney Olympics Medals: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese athletes will face a
very intense competition in next year's Olympics with golds only
probable in six or seven disciplines, a Chinese sports leader said
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Weimin, Vice President of the Chinese National Sports
General Administration, said over 200 Chinese athletes have
qualified for next year's Sydney Olympics in 101 events from 17
disciplines so far.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that China, who finished fourth on overall medals
standings at the 1996 Olympics, would meet with strong challenge
from such world powerhouses like Germany, France and the hosts
Australia.
</P>
<P>
"The final rankings from third to sixth will be fairly hard to
predict considering the intense competition there," said Yuan on a
ceremony to officially launch the crucial winter training for the
national teams.
</P>
<P>
Yuan said that China has no sure bets in its strong events
although they have the strength to compete for golds in six or
seven disciplines like gymnastics, diving, table tennis, shooting
and weightlifting.
</P>
<P>
"The chances for Olympic medals are promising but not certain,"
said Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Yuan said China also failed to qualify for 28 events, including
the men's soccer and women's basketball.
</P>
<P>
China can gain more Olympic berths through qualifiers to be
held next year, or by finishing top on some sports' rankings, and
possibilities exist for acquiring wild cards for Sydney, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Games will be staged from September 15 to October 1,
featuring 28 disciplines and 300 events.

<HEADLINE> UAE Papers Comment on Attack on Israeli Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Arabic-language
newspapers in the United Arab Emirates have reacted to Tuesday
attack on the Israeli Embassy in Amman, Jordan by questioning the
rationality of calling the assailant as insane.
</P>
<P>
The man who shot outside the Israeli Embassy "was not mad as
some people indicated," the Sharjah-based Al Khaleej daily
asserted on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"If anyone who shoots at the enemy is mad, then those who
resist Israel are," the paper said, "This new accusation adopted
by some (Arab) countries to justify any attack against the enemy
shows the degradation of the Arab world in dealing with the
Zionist occupation."
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Jordanian government played down the shooting
incident, which caused no casualties, saying that the gunman might
have mental problems. Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in
1994.
</P>
<P>
Israel, however, said the attack was targeted at its mission.
</P>
<P>
"Since some Arab countries started rushing toward normalization
of ties with Israel, the tone has changed and freedom fighters
have become mentally unstable, while their struggle is being
reduced to irresponsible and terrorist acts," the paper observed.
</P>
<P>
"Why the so-called mentally unstable shoot only at the
Israelis? Do mad people discriminate between Israelis and others?"
it queried.
</P>
<P>
The incident reflected the air of tension between Israel and
the Arab countries it has diplomatic relations with, said another
Arabic-language paper, the Dubai-based Al Bayan.
</P>
<P>
It also showed that Israel, along with its new allies, is
trying to uproot all forms of legitimate resistance to its
occupation of Arab territories, which will lead, in the end, to
turning Arab masses into mentally unstable people, the paper
said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Hold Trade Exhibition in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- A trade exhibition sponsored by
the Department of Export Promotion of the Thai Ministry of
Commerce in collaboration with its Myanmar counterpart will be
held here from December 1 to 4.
</P>
<P>
The four-day exhibition, which is the second of its kind in
Myanmar, will display 140 booths of a wide array of products and
services of 120 Thai prominent companies, according to a press
release issued here Thursday by the Thai Embassy in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition assumes particular importance in that it will
afford the governments of Thailand and Myanmar an excellent
opportunity to strengthen their trade relations, as well as to
foster the spirit of goodwill and cooperation that has long
existed between the two countries, the release said.
</P>
<P>
Participated by 93 Thai prominent manufacturers and exporters,
the first trade exhibition of Thailand in Myanmar, aimed at
stimulating trade and investment between the two countries, was
held here in December last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest Economic Indicators issued by the
Central Statistical Organization of Myanmar, the bilateral trade
between Myanmar and Thailand reached 441.38 million U.S. dollars
in 1998. Myanmar's imports from Thailand were valued at 348.15
million dollars in the year, while its exports to Thailand were
worth 93.23 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is Myanmar's second major trading partner after
Singapore. The two countries' bilateral trade accounts for 11.14
percent of Myanmar's annual foreign trade.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- One million Zambian children
are likely to be infected with HIV/AIDS by next year, Lusaka
Province Deputy Minister Sonny Mulenga has said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when officiating a satellite function for
the commemoration of the World AIDS Campaign in Lusaka, Zambia
Daily Mail newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The disease is not being taken seriously and nothing tangible
is being done on the ground despite the crusade taking place every
where, Mulenga was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The rate at which HIV/AIDS is spreading would incur a disaster
for the country because it is wiping out the youth and children,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister called on the Ministry of Education to
include sex education if the rate is to be reduced.
</P>
<P>
He called on parents to listen to the views raised by their
children on AIDS to understand what is vital for their lives.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the youth to be vocal on issues concerning
AIDS, saying the launch of HIV/AIDS campaign should coincide with
this.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that more than three million children and young
people world wide became infected with HIV in 1998, more than half
of them living in sub-Saharan Africa.

DHAKA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- A writ petition seeking to
nullify the constitutional provision of Bangladesh for the
caretaker government was filed with the High Court Wednesday,
apparently further complicating the current political
controversies in the country.
</P>
<P>
A lawyer of the Bangladesh Supreme Court, M. Salimullah,
brought the writ challenging the Constitution 13th Amendment
terming the revision that stipulated the cared second term after February 15,
1996 parliament elections.
</P>
<P>
The petitioner contended that the 13th amendment enabling a
caretaker government to hold parliament elections within 90 days
contravened the constitution as it does not permit ruling Awami League to pave the way
for holding general elections under the caretaker government. This
is their hartal program for six days in the month of November.

<HEADLINE> Auto-Parts Makers' Future Marketing Pattern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Major players in the auto
industry attending the '99 International Franchise Exhibition
believe that chain stores will become the favorite marketing ploy
for Chinese auto-parts producers in a few years.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China has more than 110,000 auto-parts makers of
varied production scales. Most of them lag behind their foreign
counterparts in equipment and management, several experts pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
Some suggested that it is more advisable for competent auto-
parts producers to merge and open sales outlets nationwide than
for auto makers to establish their own repair and maintenance
centers.
</P>
<P>
By doing so, they noted, resources can be fully used and the
auto-parts market will be more competitive when WTO entry allows
in foreign manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The Lamba Auto Parts Chain Store Co. Ltd. is one Chinese auto-
parts maker that has profited from franchising.
</P>
<P>
Lamba is the only sales outlet of the U.S. NAPA Co., the world'
s largest auto-parts provider and maintainer. Under the contract,
Lamba gets trade mark application rights and technological back-up
from NAPA, and is responsible for selling 70 percent of its
imported products.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Guangjun, president of Lamba, said that it is " big news"
for NAPA that China will soon enter the WTO.
</P>
<P>
He said that joining WTO means that Chinese consumers will
become more demanding of product quality and service, and Lamba's
advantages in this respect will allow them to compete successfully.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Fossils Intact After Earthquake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The 5.2 earthquake that struck
southwest China's Yunnan Province early this morning did not harm
the Chengjiang animal fossil site, acknowledged as one of the most
important geological discoveries of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
The epicenter of the earthquake this morning was 20 kilometers
from the Chengjiang Paleontology Protection Zone on top of Maotian
Mountain, the original discovery site.
</P>
<P>
One worker at the fossil site saw no damage to the fossils in
spite of the strong tremble, and a further survey this morning
showed that the fossils are safe and sound, according to Yang
Yingkang, a staff member of the protection zone.
</P>
<P>
Chengjiang fossils include large quantities of tiny
multicellular animals and their embryos, which have proved to be
the earliest multicellular animals on Earth and are more than 20
million years older than similar finds in Australia, which had
been regarded as the earliest such animal. Their discovery has led
to significant breakthroughs in attempts to understand the
evolution of life.
</P>
<P>
The Chengjiang fossil site, together with the finds in Australia
and the Burgess Shale in Canada discovered earlier this century,
are the three most important resources for examples of the
earliest life forms on Earth.

<HEADLINE> URGENT: 104 Killed in Shipwreck in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- At least 104 of the 312
passengers and crewmen aboard the ship Dashun have been found dead
in a shipwreck near the port city of Yantai in east China's
Shangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers said that only 20 survivors have been found so
far.
</P>
<P>
The ship, belonging to a Shandong company, was forced to turn
back due to the gale-force winds and huge waves Wednesday
afternoon as it headed for the port of Dalian in northeast China's
Liaoning Province. The vessel sent out distress signals when
flames were discovered at 4:30 p.m. on the second deck.
</P>
<P>
No ships in the area were able to approach Dashun for help
because of the strong wind and high waves.
</P>
<P>
The main helm apparently broke apart at 8:15 p.m. Wednesday,
and the ship drifted at sea. The fire spread to the third deck and
no signals were sent out after 11:45 p.m., and later the ship was
found stranded.
</P>
<P>
The low temperature, around zero degree Celsius, and the
continuous gale made rescue operations difficult.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire is still under investigation.

<HEADLINE> IBM Donates Computer Systems to Chinese Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- All four S/390 large computer
systems donated by IBM to Chinese universities are now operational
as one such system went into use at the Central China Science and
Engineering University Wednesday, reports said.
</P>
<P>
In July 1997, IBM donated four S/390 computer systems, with an
aggregate value of 32 million U.S. dollars, to Central China
Science and Engineering University, Beijing University, Fudan
University and South China Science and Engineering University, and
also helped build a number of IBM technological centers.
</P>
<P>
Calling cooperation between IBM and Chinese universities a "win-
win" deal, Zhou Ji, academician at the China Academy of
Engineering Sciences and president of the Wuhan-based Central
China Science and Engineering University, said that the
development of the information industry and electronic business,
large data storage capacity, and the new complications in
commercial affairs, will all be aided by this computer system.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes the operation of the S/390 system will
advance development of information industry, the training of
qualified personnel, and e-business construction in central China.
</P>
<P>
The IBM S/390 computer system boasts a large corporate
management platform and e-business functions, and can be used in
the administration of large corporate enterprises.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 percent of the world's business data is processed
by S/390 computer systems. China now has imported about 100 units
of this system which are mainly used in the country's financial
sector and large enterprises.

<HEADLINE> China Reports Full Success of Aerospace Computer Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- With the retrieval of the
Shenzhou spacecraft on November 21, the computer system used in
the process scored its 100th success and created a perfect
operations record, according to Chinese scientists.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the No. 771 Academy of China Aerospace Technology
Group said the computer system, which was developed independently
by Chinese scientists, has been used continuously for monitoring
and guiding aerospace launching projects for the past 28 years.
</P>
<P>
Since the creation of China's first domestically made
integrated-circuit computer in 1966, more and more advanced space
flight computers have been produced.
</P>
<P>
The recent launch and retrieval of China's first experimental
spacecraft, part of the country's manned space flight program, is
another milestone marking China's great achievements in the field.
</P>
<P>
The perfect success record is the fruit of hard work by
generations of Chinese experts, who have been making every effort
to produce advanced aerospace computers of high quality, said the
head of the No. 771 academy.
</P>
<P>
In 1975, Chinese scientists spent only seven months, usually
one researching period, to accomplish the entire process of
creating the Long March-2 carrier rocket computers and the launch
project, with all the six computers passing operational tests at
one time.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Blow Against International Non-Proliferation Efforts (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese Foreign Ministry
official has suggested that the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM)
will continue to play a role in maintaining strategic balance and
stability prior to the possible complete destruction of nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
The ABM treaty is a product of the U.S. and the former Soviet
Union during the Cold War, which is based on the theory of "
mutually assured destruction," said Sha Zukang, director of the
Foreign Ministry's Arms Control Department.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. submitts resolutions every another year to the U.N.
General Assembly, calling for observance by all countries of the
treaties on arms control and disarmament. The U.S. also has been
telling other countries that the ABM treaty is a pillar of
strategic balance and a precondition for further nuclear
disarmament," said Sha. "But ironically, the U.S. wants to modify
and has even threatened to retreat from the treaty."
</P>
<P>
Sha blamed the U.S. for infringing on the sixth item of the Non-
Proliferation Treaty (NPT), in which countries in possession of
nuclear weapons make pledges on nuclear disarmament. "The U.S.
action will exert a negative influence on U.S.-Russian bilateral
nuclear disarmament, and possibly on multilateral disarmament in
the future," he said.

joined in the NPT with the basic understanding that nuclear
disarmament will continue until nuclear arms are destroyed, he
said, the U.S. action will probably give rise to another nuclear
arms race and lead to nuclear proliferation, which will greatly
hinder international efforts to end nuclear proliferation.
</P>
<P>
Sha pointed out that the U.S. attempt to modify the ABM and
establish a missile defensive system will eventually cause an arms
race in space, which "is in no one's interest."
</P>
<P>
Those advocating modifying and retreating from the ABM argue
that the U.S. should enjoy absolute safety, said Sha, "but
actually there's no such a thing as absolute safety, and one
country's absolute safety means less or no safety for others."
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of fact, the U.S. has already enjoyed more safety
than any other country. Then, why does the U.S. plan to waste its
taxpayers' money for something that harms others without
benefiting itself?" Sha asked.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Inheritance Tax to Target Millionaires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- China is like to institute an
inheritance tax by the middle of next year aimed mainly at the
newly rich, the Beijing Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
 Tax expert Dr. Qian Sheng was quoted as saying that this tax
has been recommended by officials and other experts, and that it
should be collected before the distribution of the deceased's
estate.
</P>
<P>
 An official with the State Taxation Administration said
earlier at a symposium in Beijing that citizens who own only a
three-room apartment bought with salary savings do not need to
worry about this upcoming new tax.
</P>
<P>
"You will not have to pay this tax," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, the starting amount subject to the tax
will probably be as high as millions of yuan in property.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: ASEAN's Opportunities And Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are scheduled to gather here later
this week for an informal summit, which is expected to be
dominated by issues of economic reforms, consensus building and
cooperation in the region.
</P>
<P>
When ASEAN leaders meet on Sunday, they will find the mood this
year is much more buoyant than the gloomy atmosphere a year ago,
as their countries have recovered more quickly than expected from
a regional financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Just a year ago, the crisis-hit ASEAN members, notably
Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines, all found
themselves struggling in a severe economic recession. Their
economies, after a decade of robust growth, contracted in a range
of 0.1 percent to 13.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis has not only undermined the economic power
of ASEAN, but also weakened the grouping's role in regional and
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
But now, the gloomy picture is turning into a brighter one this
year, with all ASEAN members' economies recovering faster than
expected from recessions.
</P>
<P>
The economic turnaround has offered ASEAN opportunities to
regain its strengthen both economically and politically, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
"What we hope for is continuing strong communications among
governments, continuing commitment to make ASEAN single market,
cooperation in helping each other handle capital flows, and
sharing of information," said Felipe Medalla, socio-economic
planning secretary of the Philippines, when referring to the
agenda of the upcoming ASEAN summit.

<TEXT>
<P>
Economists also warned that the slow banking reforms and
economic adjustments, coupled with bad corporate debts, are still
threatening to derail the recovery process.
</P>
<P>
The realization of the ASEAN-10 also create new problems for
the group to speed up regional cooperation in consensus building,
economic integrity and security enhancement. In economic terms,
there is a division in ASEAN between the rich and poorer
countries. This will compel the group to implement its economic
and trade cooperation program with different timetables.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are many differences between ASEAN members
as far as their political systems and social and cultural
backgrounds are concerned.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, analysts said, ASEAN must seek greater unity and
need more coordination and consensus building in handling
political, economic and security issues.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, ASEAN must meet another big challenge -- environment
protection, as forest fires in recent years have affected the
environment, tourism and economic growth in its member countries.
</P>
<P>
The group is currently considering forging an accord that will
strengthen the enforcement of environment regulations within the
region.
</P>
<P>
"We are now working on the possibility of a legal framework to
at least hold ASEAN members to the enforcement of their own
national laws," said ASEAN Secretary General Rodolfo Severino at a
recent forum.
</P>
<P>
Facing all these opportunities and new challenges, ASEAN
leaders at the Manila summit will have to adopt new strategies for
the region's development and cooperation in the 21st century,
analysts said.

<P>
The realization of the ASEAN-10 this year has also created more
favorable conditions for the grouping to play a greater role in
regional and world affairs, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-two years ago, ASEAN was born in Bangkok. Its founding
members had a dream: to unite all 10 countries in the region. On
April 30 this year, Cambodia was formally admitted into the group
and ASEAN's aspiration finally came true.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said that after Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and
Myanmar joined the group, ASEAN could represent the whole
Southeast Asian region, and play its important role in the
regional and world affairs.
</P>
<P>
As well, the group can now better coordinate in resolving
disputes within the region, thus preventing Western powers from
interfering in the affairs of the region.
</P>
<P>
However, a major challenge ASEAN is facing now is how to seize
the opportunities of the economic rebound and its enlargement to
achieve a full recovery and revitalize its role in the region and
the rest of the world. And this may dominate their discussions on
Sunday when the ASEAN leaders meet in Manila.
</P>
<P>
At present, ASEAN members are still facing a series of great
challenges to rebuild its economic and political strengthen.
Although the regional economy is recovering, ASEAN economics
ministers noted at a recent meeting that the initial rebound is
buoyed by the "strong U.S. economic growth, improvement in the
European Union and Japanese economies, as well as the upturn in
the global electronics cycle."
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN countries must, therefore, continue to be vigilant and
keep up our efforts to enhance our business environments through
pro-enterprise policies and economic restructuring," the ministers
said.

<HEADLINE> India Lays Down Strategy for WTO Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 25 (Xinhua) -- India will resist any move
to raise non-trade related social and environment issues by
developed countries at the scheduled ministerial meeting of the
World Trade Organization (WTO) in Seattle, the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet Committee on Foreign Trade finalized a strategy for
the WTO meeting Wednesday night with an adoption of "a
give-and-take approach" to trade issues, according to Murasoli
Maran, the commerce and industry minister who will lead Indian
delegation to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Short after the cabinet meeting presided over by Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Maran told the press that India would resist
any move to allow participation of non-governmental organizations
in the dispute settlement mechanism.
</P>
<P>
"India would adopt a give-and-take approach at Seattle to
protest the country's interest and also bargain for trade access,"
he said but declined to give details.
</P>
<P>
The bottom line at Seattle would be to "protest India's
interests at all costs," Maran said following the 90-minute
meeting, adding the Indian delegation would bargain.
</P>
<P>
Official sources here said New Delhi would strongly resist
attempts of the developed countries to link labor standards and
environment protection to legitimize trade protection in a bid to
deny market access to the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
India would also raise some new issues including general access
for non-agricultural products while opposing the competition and
coherence in global economic policy making, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Maran met leaders of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP) and some in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance to
elicit views on WTO issues.
</P>
<P>
"National interests will be the touchstone at Seattle," he said
Wednesday after his meeting with political parties and National
Advisory Committee on International trade.
</P>
<P>
The BJP had reportedly submitted a detailed paper to Maran
demanding that the government should insist on full implementation
of the existing WTO agreements and totally oppose the attempts by
developed countries to push new issues at the WTO meeting
scheduled to open towards the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
It said that India should stick to the position that the
Seattle meeting should be limited to the purpose of examining the
experiences of the member countries in implementing the Marrakech
Agreement including the mandated agenda items.
</P>
<P>
The government should resist attempts by the developed
countries to push additional agenda items such as Multilateral
Agreement on Investment, competition policy, transparency in
government procurement practices, industrial tariffs, trade and
environment and labor standards, BJP General Secretary K. N.
Govindacharya told news media here.
</P>
<P>
However, the Economic Times reported Thursday that the Vajpayee
government would toe a more flexible line in Seattle than in
previous years.
</P>
<P>
While trying to extract a favorable deal for the country and
sticking to its policy against linking trade with issues like
labor standards and environment, New Delhi's emphasis would be to
project itself as one that is open to the demands of liberalized
economy, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
The stand, "if we get nothing, we give nothing" endorsed by the
Cabinet Committee Wednesday, is seen as a major departure from the
past years when Indian negotiators had adopted a closed approach.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that New Delhi's approach would be India
specific rather than playing the role of a "champion of the
developing world's interests."

<HEADLINE> Those Better Off Volunteer To Aid The Needy (1) </HEADLINE>

<P>
NANCHANG, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Xie Yuantai, an ordinary
farmer 15 years ago in east China's Jiangxi Province, has
thoroughly remolded himself and become quite a man of local
reputable.
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old Xie has won popularity not only because he in
the local avant-garde in becoming better off through agricultural
growth, but also because he has assisted 5,000 of his countrymen
to shake off poverty and take off on the road to prosperity.
</P>
<P>
He made his own way by growing mushrooms and processing related
products in Guangchang County, and thus took the lead in becoming
affluent in this poverty-stricken county.
</P>
<P>
In order to help his countrymen change their destiny, Xie
volunteered to offer free technology-training courses and sold
equipment on credit to the local needy, and then repurchased
mushrooms at prices in favor of the growers.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the mushroom-growing business has ushered in an even
better life for fellow farmers in the county and has become a
pillar business for local economic growth by creating 18 million
yuan worth of output value per year.
</P>
<P>
It goes without saying that the local farmers aided by Xie have
now tasted the sweet and seen their annual average income
skyrocket to 6,000 yuan ( 720 US dollars), more than 23 times the
figure just three years ago.
</P>
<P>
The group backed by Xie is also being expanded at low cost and
now has 18 million yuan (2.17 million US dollars) in fixed assets
investment, a booming business Xie attributes to the support of
the large number of farmers he has assisted.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the number of people becoming wealthy in a way
similar to Xie is also mushrooming, and most of them have followed
Xie's example to become volunteer aids to the needy farmers in the
county.

Among examples such as Xie, also deserving of mention is Liu
Yonghao, chairman of the board of the Hope Group in southwest
China's Sichuan Province, the largest non-governmental enterprise
in China.
</P>
<P>
Liu has offered proposals for non-governmental undertakings
nationwide to launch a development program to aid the poor across
the country, and has funded two livestock fodder processing
enterprises in Jiangxi Province as part of this effort.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi Province now has had 471 projects funded by private
entrepreneurs and aimed at bring prosperity to those in the
economically backward province. These projects have cost a total
of 1.9 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Half of the amount of money used for aid-the-poor projects in
Jiangxi Province comes from private resources, and these projects
include all the poor counties in the Province.
</P>
<P>
A survey shows that more than 2,600 entrepreneurs have invested
a total of 7.5 billion yuan in 3,000-plus projects in areas along
the Beijing-Kowloon railway line and reservoir areas of the Three-
Gorges project. These efforts have helped provide jobs for 380,000
needy farmers and other residents living in these areas, and have
given 1.53 million people access to abundant food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yuqi, an economist with the Jiangxi Provincial Academy of
Social Sciences, noted that the participation of the newly better
off in aid-the-poor programs will play an increasingly vital role
in stepping up economic development in China's less-developed
regions.

BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- About 80 percent of the
villages across China have made public their financial accounts to
villagers as required by the law on village autonomy, but fraud
still exist in quite a number of places, the People's Daily
reported today.

<P>
A national conference was convened Wednesday in the city of
Yuncheng in north China's Shanxi Province by the Ministry of
Agriculture to push for open financial accounting to villagers.
</P>
<P>
Some of accounts have been found to be open only to a certain
extent, and far from fully, the paper said. Such practices are
regarded as a breeding ground for corruption of village officials.
</P>
<P>
According to the conference, the public has shown enthusiasm
for the policy of opening accounts now being implemented across
the country, by which financial affairs are to be decided by all
villagers by democratic means.
</P>
<P>
Local officials should take measures to ensure that this
practice is earnestly enforced in order to solve the many problems
in villages and win the confidence of the public, the conference
was told.

<HEADLINE> China Able to Feed Its People: Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- China will be able to feed its
people, even when the country's population rises to 1.5 billion,
according to a latest international research.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion is the result of a four-year study by the
Austria-based International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis
and the Institute of Geography of Chinese Academy of Sciences,
China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The new study contradicts earlier research that found China
could not feed its growing population because of a shortage of
arable land and would have to import a large amount of food.
</P>
<P>
China now has a population of 1.2 billion people, or 22 percent
of the world's population. It is projected to 1.5 billion by the
year of 2025.
</P>
<P>
The earlier studies underestimated China's cultivated land and
the larger role scientific advances and technology could play,
said authors of the latest study.
</P>
<P>
"China has great potential to increase its food supply if
appropriate measures are adopted," Gerhard Heilig, a senior
researcher at the international institute, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The research found that the so-called "degradation" of arable
land only slightly affected crop production.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the cropland decline is a result of conversion --
farmers using crop land for horticulture land, fish ponds or for
re-forestation," said Heilig, who headed the study.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the most advanced countries in terms of using
genetic markets and tools in rice breeding, and the technology
will benefit China in ensuring a more than adequate food supply,
Heilig said.
</P>
<P>
"Taking into account population, change in diet, urbanization,
arable land quantity and water resources into consideration, we
found China has great potential for increasing its food supply,
and the viewpoint that China's food needs will pose a threat to
the world is nonsense," Heilig concluded.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Probes Alleged Conspiracy over War Defeats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
launched a police inquiry into an alleged political conspiracy
behind the severe military reversals suffered in north recently by
the army forces.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary investigations showed that the main opposition
United National Party (UNP) had been conniving with Tamil rebels
to discredit the government ahead of presidential elections next
month, the official Daily News reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The government has alleged that representatives of the UNP had
visited the northern Wanni area, conferred with some senior
military officers and then had talks with the Tamil rebels just
prior to the rebels' attacks on several army camps, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Government troops suffered their worst setback at the hands of
the Tamil rebels earlier this month when the military was driven
out of 10 towns and a large chunk of territory which they captured
from rebels over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
The rebels of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have been
fighting for a separate Tamil state in Sri Lanka's north and east
since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The government has charged that UNP Member of Parliament Dr.
Jayalath Jayawardena and former army Chief of Staff Major General
Lucky Algama were involved in the conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly Algama was questioned by police for five hours on
Tuesday concerning his visit to the Wanni area.
</P>
<P>
President Chandrika Kumaratunga recently revealed that Algama,
former deputy inspector general of police Premadasa Udugampola and
several other retired senior military and police personnel were
seen frequently at the UNP's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Recent statements of Opposition and Leader of the UNP Ranil
Wickremesinghe that he will hand over the north and the east of
the country to the rebels for two years for resolving the ethnic
conflict if he won the presidential polls next month, are also
being investigated as being connected with the conspiracy, said
the reports.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga has alleged that these statements by the
Opposition Leader smacked of high treason and were punishable
offenses in a Court of Law.
</P>
<P>
However, Wickremesinghe has denied the statements and
involvement in the unprecedented debacles suffered by the
military.
</P>
<P>
Wickremesinghe, who is contesting Chandrika Kumaratunga in the
December 21 Presidential election, said at a news conference on
Wednesday the president must accept responsibility for the
debacles and step down as the commander-in-chief of the security
forces.
</P>
<P>
He said he was also planning legal action against Kumaratunga
and the state media for what he called "the smear campaign."

<HEADLINE> Hungarian Foreign Minister to Visit Russia for Improvement of Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian Foreign Minister
Martonyi Janos will pay a delayed working visit to Russia on
November 28-29 in a bid to repair bilateral ties seriously harmed
by discords since early this year, according to a Foreign Ministry
statement issued Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Preparations will also be made for a planned meeting of prime
ministers of the two countries during his visit, which was
originally set for late May, but postponed by Moscow after the
April blockade at the Hungarian borders of Russian and Belarussian
humanitarian convoys destined for Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In July, Hungary rejected the passage of six Russian aircraft
taking military personnel to take part in the United Nations
peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, provoking strong displeasure again
from Russia.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministry statement said that Hungary is looking
forward to proper partnership relations with Russia, noting that
differences between them over certain international issues should
not affect the development of their relations.
</P>
<P>
Hungary's accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (
NATO) was not designed against Russia, the ministry emphasized.
Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland joined the Western military
alliance on March 12 this year in the first stage of the
organization's eastward expansion program, which was vehemently
opposed by Russia.
</P>
<P>
A top official from the Hungarian Foreign Ministry on Wednesday
stressed that Hungary regards Russia as an important partner, and
hopes to reverse the current trend in their relations through
cooperation and to be of help to improving Russia's ties with NATO.
</P>
<P>
On Hungary's diplomatic policies, the official said that it is
Hungary's long-term strategic goal to develop closer ties with
Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS).
</P>
<P>
The significance of CIS countries will not be weakened in
Hungary's diplomacy, he noted, adding that a favorable environment
has now emerged in that region for the promotion of bilateral
relations.

<HEADLINE> China Steps Up Wildlife Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, November 25 (Xinhua) -- China has been constantly
stepping up its efforts to protect its wildlife resources with
notable results in recent years, according to an on-going
international symposium here.
</P>
<P>
To date, China has set up more than 900 natural protection
zones across the country, taking up about seven percent of the
nation's land, the symposium was told.
</P>
<P>
In areas where protected zones are not sufficient for the
survival of some species, artificial propagation and planting has
been implemented, saving quite a number of endangered species.
</P>
<P>
To regulate international trade in wildlife and products, China
has published catalogues of wildlife imports and exports,
categorically banning the trade of tiger bones and rhinoceros
horns.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China's customs and public security departments have
beefed up their efforts to crack down on illegal trade in wildlife
and wildlife products, according to Meng Sha, deputy director of
the country' management office for endangered-species trade, today.
</P>
<P>
China also has joined a host of international conventions such
as those on wetlands and bio-diversity, and has hosted a series of
international meetings on wildlife protection.
</P>
<P>
Last month, an international workshop on the protection of the
Tibetan antelope was held in Xining, the capital of northwestern
Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
The country has also adopted the "Xining Declaration" which
calls for the further protection of the Tibetan antelope and
stipulates harsh penalties for poachers and illegal traders.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Police Ready to Deploy in Aceh Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA November 25 (Xinhua)-- Amid tense in Indonesia's
most-western province of Aceh, hundreds of police personnel were
ready to be landed to control the situation, the Indonesian
Observer Thursday quoted National Police spokesman Col. Saleh Saaf
as saying.
</P>
<P>
It said at least 876 riot troops had been deploying in the
troubled province.
</P>
<P>
"We need more police and troops to safeguard and restore law
and order in the province as there have been many killings and
atrocities," Saaf said, giving no details how many troop now had
been based in the area.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, out-going Army Chief of Staff Gen. Soebagio
Hadisiswoyo insisted army troops had been ready to be sent into
Aceh to curb insurgence, particularly to minimize possible
violence ahead the GAM anniversary.
</P>
<P>
"We are always ready. But so far there has been no instruction
yet," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Commander of the Teuku Umar Military Col.
Syarifuddin Tippe admitted on Wednesday that situation in Aceh had
been deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
"If in the next few days the situation in Aceh remains tense, I
will ask (the central command) to impose a curfew," he said as
quoted by the Jakarta Post daily.
</P>
<P>
In the beginning of Wednesday, at least two were killed and two
others injured following gun-fighting between unidentified two
armed gangs.
</P>
<P>
The fighting took place at Geuceu Meunara village in the
Meuraxa district.
</P>
<P>
Local villagers said there were many armed gangs that often
barged into resident's home to ask money by force.
</P>
<P>
Aceh, with a population of only 4.3 million, most of them
Moslem, has been demanding independence to separate from
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
In early November, at least more than one million Acehnese
gathered in Banda Aceh, capital of the province, to demand a
referendum on the rights of the people of that province to self-
determination.
</P>
<P>
This was an impressive display of solidarity since the Free
Aceh Movement (GAM) unilaterally declared independence on December
4, 1976.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Thai FM Praises China's "One Country, Two Systems" Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Thai Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan lauded Wednesday China's policy of "one country, two
systems", saying it has worked well in Hong Kong judging from the
situation in the territory during the past two years.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua here, Surin said that Hong Kong has
achieved a high-degree of self-rule during the two years after its
sovereignty was returned from Britain to the People's Republic of
China on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Surin admitted that two years ago before Hong Kong's return, he
personally had expected that the territory would be facing more
problems on adjustment and international confidence.
</P>
<P>
But he now finds out that Hong Kong's development is better
than his expectation.
</P>
<P>
"They (the Hong Kong people) have done very well. They have
managed their affairs very effectively. They have managed the
relations with the mainland in a manner that has generated mutual
confidence both from the mainland and from the residents in Hong
Kong," the Thai minister said.
</P>
<P>
Confidence has also been built in the international community
in the leaders of Hong Kong for their great achievements,
efficiency and foresight, he said.
</P>
<P>
He praised that the Chinese central government has the wisdom
to treat Hong Kong as an economy with a different system and to
allow Hong Kong to continue to prosper, function and carry on its
dynamism.
</P>
<P>
As for the financial crisis which hit Southeast Asian economies
including Hong Kong, Surin said Hong Kong, as a service, finance,
information and banking center, could not avoid the impact when
the region was affected because it draws its sustenance and
vitality from the region.
</P>
<P>
But the impact has been alleviated by the fact that it has
become part of China because the mainland cushioned the shock of
the crisis for the special administrative region.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese central government has kept Hong Kong's interest in
mind when making decisions, again displaying its wisdom and
foresight, he said.
</P>
<P>
Surin expressed his belief that the concept of "one country,
two systems", under which the return of Hong Kong and Macao
becomes possible, will be suitable for the case of Macao, whose
sovereignty will be returned to China from Portugal on December 20.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure it will work in the case of Macao," said the foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
Surin said he believed that in the future the two systems will
"adopt and adapt", meaning adopting the best features of each
other and adapting to the expectation and requirements of the
other.
</P>
<P>
"In the future, I'm sure the two will converge to a degree that
is comfortable to both," he said.
</P>
<P>
Surin, who will attend Macao's returning ceremony on December
19 as a guest of the Chinese government, said he is convinced that
Macao will serve as a special entity with unique feature of its
own after its return.
</P>
<P>
"It will continue to attract businesses and tourists," he said,
urging Asian countries to forge closer and more effective
cooperation among themselves and make full use of the new
atmosphere and situation.

<HEADLINE> Hungarian Foreign Minister to Visit Russia for Improvement of Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian Foreign Minister
Martonyi Janos will pay a delayed working visit to Russia on
November 28-29 in a bid to repair bilateral ties seriously harmed
by discords since early this year, according to a Foreign Ministry
statement issued Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Preparations will also be made for a planned meeting of prime
ministers of the two countries during his visit, which was
originally set for late May, but postponed by Moscow after the
April blockade at the Hungarian borders of Russian and Belarussian
humanitarian convoys destined for Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In July, Hungary rejected the passage of six Russian aircraft
taking military personnel to take part in the United Nations
peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, provoking strong displeasure again
from Russia.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministry statement said that Hungary is looking
forward to proper partnership relations with Russia, noting that
differences between them over certain international issues should
not affect the development of their relations.
</P>
<P>
Hungary's accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (
NATO) was not designed against Russia, the ministry emphasized.
Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland joined the Western military
alliance on March 12 this year in the first stage of the
organization's eastward expansion program, which was vehemently
opposed by Russia.
</P>
<P>
A top official from the Hungarian Foreign Ministry on Thursday
stressed that Hungary regards Russia as an important partner, and
hopes to reverse the current trend in their relations through
cooperation and to be of help to improving Russia's ties with NATO.
</P>
<P>
On Hungary's diplomatic policies, the official said that it is
Hungary's long-term strategic goal to develop closer ties with
Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS).
</P>
<P>
The significance of CIS countries will not be weakened in
Hungary's diplomacy, he noted, adding that a favorable environment
has now emerged in that region for the promotion of bilateral
relations.

<HEADLINE> Arms Control Official on Theater Missile Defensive (TMD) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- An official with the Chinese
Foreign Ministry said in a recent interview with Xinhua that "
China does not reject the whole concept of TMD".
</P>
<P>
China understands the role of TMD in protecting stationed
troops and what China opposes is the advanced TMD system which
could be employed during National Missile Defensive, Sha Zukang,
director of the Arms Control Department of the Foreign Ministry,
said, adding that "this will undermine the strategic balance."
</P>
<P>
Sha pointed out that it is not necessary for Japan to join the
TMD of the United States. Even when faced with the bigger threat
during the cold war period than at present, Japan did not think of
TMD, and it is more unnecessary for Japan to do so now for the
international relations are relaxed, relations between big nations
are improved and the Japan-Russian relations have improved
remarkably, and peace and development have become the trend of the
time, Sha said.
</P>
<P>
"The so-called threat from Democratic People's Republic of
Korea to Japan is just a pretext," Sha added.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the question of whether Japan's participation in
TMD of the United States might trigger the arms race between China
and Japan, Sha said that China, as all other sovereign states,
will take "necessary measures" to safeguard its national security
and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
However, Sha pointed out that "China did not, does not and will
not participate in any form of arms race, and even if Japan is
willing to, China will not do so."

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ASEAN Industrial Cooperation Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Finance and economic ministers
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are
gathering here Thursday to discuss regional cooperation, including
ASEAN's industrial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The main thrust of industrial cooperation in ASEAN is focused
on the ASEAN Industrial Cooperation (AICO) Scheme, which became
operational on November 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
To date, ASEAN member countries have received 62 AICO
applications, 28 of which have been approved.
</P>
<P>
Under the ASEAN Statement on Bold Measures and other decisions,
for applications received between January 1, 1999 and December 31,
2000, the following conditions will apply:
</P>
<P>
-- automatic waiver of 30 percent equity requirement;
</P>
<P>
-- AICO arrangement in the form of intra-firm transaction is
allowed;
</P>
<P>
-- reduction of AICO processing time from 60 to 45 days, and
from 60 to 45 days for internal administrative procedures to
effect the AICO tariff rate;
</P>
<P>
-- participating countries may grant conditional approval when
national policy, domestic law or regulation require that such
condition be imposed;
</P>
<P>
-- AICO Final Product as a final product of an AICO arrangement
is desirable but not mandatory.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing companies that belong to the same group of
companies or are administrated by the same principal can now apply
to form intra-firm AICO arrangements among themselves to exchange
products they specialize in.
</P>
<P>
Under the previous rules, an AICO arrangement must result in
the production of at least one AICO Final Product and the product
must contain AICO intermediate product, or raw materials sourced
from the participating companies. But the new rules do not require
this anymore.
</P>
<P>
Under the AICO intra-firm arrangement, companies from the same
group or administrated by the same principal and with existing
manufacturing facilities in different locations in ASEAN can now
use the AICO Scheme to rationalize their production units.
</P>
<P>
To promote the AICO Scheme among ASEAN entrepreneurs in the new
ASEAN member countries, AICO workshops were held in Myanmar,
Vietnam, Laos in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1967, ASEAN now groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia,
Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Agassi Beats Sampras in Battle of Giants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- World number one Andre Agassi
defeated Pete Sampras 6-2, 6-2 for his first win of the year over
his compatriot at the ATP Tour world championship in Hanover,
Germany on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The much-awaited clash turned out to be a lop-sided battle as
Sampras, who played only one match in three months before the year-
end event, could not recapture the form in his opener against
Brazil's Gustavo Kuerten.
</P>
<P>
However, Sampras and Agassi are still favoured to take the
first two spots in their group of four after the round-robin phase
and advance to the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Sampras was broken in the fifth game as he double-faulted to go
3-2 down, and failed to keep his seventh game again as Agassi hit
his backhand pass for 5-2 before wrapping up the first set in 35
minutes.
</P>
<P>
In the second set, Sampras made another unforced error to drop
his serve for 2-3 and was broken again two more games later.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Sampras, the only player to appear in the ATP Tour world
championship every year this decade, has already secured his
semifinal spot as he has won four times.
</P>
<P>
In other two games, Thomas Enqvist of Sweden defeated Nicolas
Kiefer of Germany 6-4, 7-5 in the White group, while Gustavo
Kuerten of Brazil nipped Nicolas Lapentti of Ecuador 6-1, 6-2 in
the Red group.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ASEAN in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The year 1999 will be
remembered as one of the most significant years in the history of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), as in the year
the vision of ASEAN founders to build a group comprising all 10
Southeast Asian countries was fully realized.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1967, ASEAN now groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia,
Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
After the group's enlargement, the ASEAN region now has a
combined population of about 500 million, a total area of 4.5
million square kilometers, a combined gross domestic product of
735 billion U.S. dollars, and a total trade volume of 720 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, ASEAN member countries have been
preoccupied with implementing reform measures to address the
causes and impact of the regional financial crisis which began in
mid-1997. The economic situation and outlook in the crisis-hit
countries, such as Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia
and Singapore, have improved since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
The region is now in the process of economic recovery, but the
pace of the recovery will depend on the implementation of economic
and financial reforms in these countries and the support of
international and development institutions, economists here said.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the recurrence of the regional contagion, ASEAN's
finance cooperation has been intensified. The member countries
have articulated the "Common ASEAN Position in Reforming the
International Architecture." ASEAN has initiated a process of
monitoring short-term capital and macro-economic indicators
through the ASEAN Surveillance Coordinating Unit at the ASEAN
Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
To mitigate the social impact of the financial crisis, ASEAN
has started to implement the Plan of Action on Social Safety Nets
and the Plan of Action on Rural Development and Poverty
Alleviation.
</P>
<P>
To restore the region's long-term economic competitiveness,
ASEAN continued to implement the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), the
ASEAN Investment Area (AIA), the ASEAN Industrial Cooperation
Scheme. The scheduled completion of AFTA has been advanced by one
year, from 2003 to 2002 for the six original members -- Brunei,
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
To promote ASEAN's technological competitiveness, ASEAN
established the Science and Technology Information Network in the
year. The network provides up-to-date information on science and
technology manpower, research and development, technology offers
and requests and technology-specific date-bases. ASEAN has also
agreed to augment the ASEAN Science Fund.
</P>
<P>
The promotion of the environment remained an important priority
for the region in the year. It continued to undertake projects in
the fields of nature conservation and biodiversity and coastal and
marine environment.
</P>
<P>
The trans-boundary haze pollution problem, which occurred in
late 1997 and early 1998 has drawn ASEAN members to collaborate
closely in preventing, monitoring and mitigating the haze disaster
resulting from land and forest fires. In 1999, ASEAN continued to
implement the Regional Haze Action Plan with its three components
-- preventing measures, monitoring measures, and strengthening
fire -- fighting capabilities.
</P>
<P>
All these actions and measures taken in the year have promote
the region's on-going economic recovery and long-term
competitiveness, and the improvement of the critical environmental
situation.

<HEADLINE> Lazio Outclasses Marseille 2-0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Lazio bounced back from their
Sunday's embarrasing 4-1 serie A defeat at Roma with an emphatic 2-
0 triumph at Olympique Marseille at the Champions League second
phase campaign on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
League leader Lazio went ahead through Yugoslav international
Dejan Stankovic who headed in a cross from Giuseppe Pancaro in the
63rd minute.
</P>
<P>
With 13 minutes left, Chilean striker Marcelo Salas drifted
behind the Marseille back four and crossed for Sergio Conceicao to
tap into an empty net.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea joined Lazio at the top of Group 4 after they
completely outplayed Dutch club Feyenoord 3-1 at Stamford Bridge.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea took control of the match but did not score until
Nigerian midfielder Celestine Babayaro's close-in header just
before half time.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian forward Tore Andre Flo made it two after Babayaro had
headed against the bar in the 66th minute and settled the match
four minutes from time. Argentina forward Julio Cruz scored a
consolation strike in the dying moments.
</P>
<P>
Seven time titlist Real Madrid overcame the freezing
temperatures to pull off a 2-1 win at Dynamo Kiev while Bayern
Munich, European Champions League finalist last season, was held
to a 1-1 tie by Norway's Rosenborg.
</P>
<P>
Fernando Morientes fired Real ahead in the 17th minute before
Raul Gonzalez made it two just after half time.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine international Serhiy Rebrov pulled one back from the
penalty spot five minutes from time but it was too little and too
late for Dynamo.
</P>
<P>
Bayern went ahead in the 10th minute through Carsten Jancker
who scored from close range, only to be equalized by Bent
Skammelsrud two minutes into the second half.
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's games, defending titlist Manchester United slumped
to a 2-0 loss to Fiorentina yet Valencia went to the top of Group
1 with a 3-0 rout of French champion Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>

to sit atop Group 3 and Barcelona, one of the title favorites,

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Capital Market Ready to Tackle Millennium Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's capital market and
its supporting institutions are all prepared for the millennium
bug, according to the Capital Market Y2K Implementation Committee.
</P>
<P>
Committee chairman Surdiyanto Suryodarmodjo said that investors
did not have to worry about possible disruptions in stock trading
activities in the new year as trading systems at both the Jakarta
and Surabaya, capital of East Java province, stock exchanges were
100 percent Year 2000 compliant.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Clearing and Settlement Agency also achieved 100
percent Y2K compliance in its computerized clearing system,
Surdiyanto was quoted by the Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the Indonesian Central Securities
depository had not complied but he said that it would not affect
overall transactions because the institution still used manual
systems in daily operations.
</P>
<P>
Surdiyanto said two-thirds of the 186 securities companies had
completed and passed a process of final testing for Y2K
compliance. The remaining one-third were declared free from Y2K
effects because they were using manual and semimanual operating
systems.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K bug, which stems from a common programming practice
which only uses two digits for the year, strikes January 1, 2000.
Computer that are not updated could mistake "00" as 1900. The
error could create problems ranging from power outages to billing
errors.
</P>
<P>
Surdiyanto said the committee also prepared a business
contingency plan to anticipate possible trading disruptions in the
new millennium.
</P>
<P>
In the overall capital market contingency business plan, there
are four alternative steps for anticipating the coming Y2K bug, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The first alternative step was to overcome the Y2K problems and
go on with the current system. The second was to switch to a
prepared back-up trading system. The third was to use the Internet
facility through the "software-based multilateral netting." And
finally, if all the above still fail, the Jakarta Stock Exchange
would go back to using manual trading.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Communications Agum Gumelar said just about all
important business sectors in Indonesia had announced their Y2K
compliance.
</P>
<P>
Agum is the chairman of the national committee for Y2K, whose
tasks are to oversee the country's preparation in anticipating the
coming Y2K bug on January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The main focus of the national Y2K committee, which was
established in 1998, is on finance and banking, health,
transportation, electricity, energy and government sectors.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Finance Ministers Discuss Macro-Economic Trends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Finance ministers and central
bank deputies of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) gathered here Thursday for a special meeting, making
preparations for the forthcoming ASEAN informal summit.
</P>
<P>
The participants are expected to discuss macro-economic trends
such as the flow of short-term capital and the regional
surveillance mechanism.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN countries' inability to handle short-term capital
movements has been partly blamed for the outbreak of a regional
financial crisis in 1997.
</P>
<P>
At the one-day meeting, the delegates will also discuss the
second surveillance report on how ASEAN members are prepared to
deal with economic problems.
</P>
<P>
The regional "surveillance mechanism" is meant to alert ASEAN
members countries of any sign of impending financial and economic
problems.
</P>
<P>
The first surveillance report released in March this year
covered measures taken by governments to protect the poor,
governance issues and resource mobilization.
</P>
<P>
Although the crisis-hit nations are rebounding from an economic
recession, the discussions will take up ways to "make sure the
recovery is enduring" and measures to "ensure future
competitiveness," said ASEAN Secretary General Rodolfo Severino at
an earlier press conference.
</P>
<P>
The ministers and central bank chiefs are expected to submit
their recommendations to heads of state and governments of ASEAN
when they meet here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ASEAN director-general, ASEAN senior officials,
senior economic and finance officials gathered here for a Special
Joint Consultative Meeting to make preparations for the informal
summit.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN senior officials will also meet their counterparts from
China, Japan and South Korea to prepare for the informal
leadership meetings set for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN, founded in 1967, now groups Brunei, Indonesia, Cambodia,
Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam.

over Austria in its Group B opener of the 2001 Euro men's
basketball qualifying tournament on Wednesday.

the half time 49-35 without much challenges from their opponents
who also missed two key players.

bring our two key players," said Austrian coach Peter Wolf.

Belarus 91-70 and Estonia lost to Greece 59-70.

MANILA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

Manila Bulletin:
</P>
<P>
-- Philippine President Joseph Estrada said Wednesday the offer
of Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid to talk the leadership
of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) should be welcomed by
all peace-loving Filipinos since this sincere effort will greatly
boost the peace process in Mindanao.
</P>

<HEADLINE> IOC Releases Final Report on Reform Recommendations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee issued Wednesday a report outlining 50 finalized reform
recommendations it plans to submit to the IOC membership for vote
next month.
</P>
<P>
A special IOC panel endorsed a series of key proposals,
including the appointment of 15 athletes to the IOC and the
introduction of an eight-year term of office and re-election
process for IOC members.
</P>
<P>
But as for the contentious issue of visits to the bidding
cities, the delegates failed to reach consensus and came out with
two options.
</P>
<P>
Members will either vote to decide that visits "are not
necessary" or vote for a tightened visits procedure, which
requires submitting individual, formal requests to travel to
candidate cities.
</P>
<P>
The 50 reform recommendations were adopted last month at a
plenary meeting of the IOC 2000 Commission, an 80-member task
force set up in the wake of the Salt Lake City bribery scandal.
</P>
<P>
It will be submitted to the full IOC general assembly at a
special session in Lausanne on December 11-12.
</P>
<P>
IOC members will also vote on a proposal requiring cities
wishing to host the Games to meet certain criteria before being
allowed to submit a bid.
</P>
<P>
The reform recommendations meanwhile called for the creation of
a special selection committee to screen candidates for IOC
membership.

<P>
KUNMING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake measuring 5.2 on
the Richter scale struck Chengjiang County in southwest China's
Yunnan Province at 00:40 today, killing one person and injuring
three others.
</P>
<P>
But tourism facilities near the epicenter were not affected,
according to an official.
</P>
<P>
The epicenter was reported to be at Longjie Town and a scenic
spot, not far from Chengjiang, the site of a Cambrian Period
geological formation dating back 500-570 million years. The quake
was felt in the provincial capital of Kunming, 60 kilometers from
the epicenter.
</P>
<P>
Three jolts ranging between 1.4-2.7 on the Richter scale were
recorded by 01:00 am this morning.
</P>
<P>
A postman named Ruan who was on duty last night said, "I felt
the house shaking continuously. Many people ran into the street."
</P>
<P>
The Provincial Seismological Bureau has sent a work team to the
spot and Communist Party and government officials of Chengjiang
County have rushed to the affected area for rescue and inspection
activities.
</P>
<P>
"The earthquake did not harm tourist facilities at the Fuxian
Lake scenic spot. Hotels there remain intact," said Zhang De,
director of Chengjiang Bureau of Tourism.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- New York Knicks swingman
Latrell Sprewell today was fined $10,000 by the NBA for his
actions during a game at Golden State on November 20.
</P>
<P>
Sprewell, making a homecoming to the Bay Area, shouted
profanities throughout the contest with the Warriors, including
several directed at fans sitting courtside. The Knicks won the
game 86-79.
</P>
<P>
It was Sprewell's first trip to Golden State since he choked
Warriors coach P.J. Carlesimo during a team practice on December 1,
1997 and was subsequently suspended and traded to New York.
</P>
<P>
Sprewell spent most of last week telling several tabloids that
he was looking forward to returning on Saturday and "crushing" the
Warriors, who left him feeling "bitter and angry."
</P>
<P>
Sprewell was booed lustily upon taking the floor for warmups at
the Arena in Oakland. He managed just seven points in 32 minutes
through three quarters before finishing with 14 on 6-of-17
shooting.
</P>
<P>
Carlesimo and Sprewell neither shook hands nor acknowledge one
another during the course of the night.

<HEADLINE> British Telecom Denies Football Rights Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- British Telecom Wednesday
denied reports that it is to make a huge bid for the television
broadcasting rights to the English Premiership football.
</P>
<P>
The telecommunications giant was said to be planning a 1.3
billion pounds bid for all rights to matches in the most glamorous
league in English football when BSkyB's current 670 million pounds
deal expires in 2001.
</P>
<P>
A BT spokesman said: "We deny any knowledge of this whatsoever.
"
</P>
<P>
The Premier League is poised to start negotiations for the
rights after the 2000/01 season, but is not expected to sell to
one main broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
Under the current four-year deal, BSkyB hold the rights to show
a limited number of live Premiership games each season, while the
BBC paid 70 million pounds to screen same-day highlights.
</P>
<P>
However, the digital television revolution in Britain has the
potential to bring other players into the battle to secure future
rights, escalating the price.
</P>
<P>
BT was said to be keen to secure the football rights because it
would put them in a powerful position when restrictions are lifted
in 2001, allowing television pictures to be transmitted via
telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion was that BT would act as a broker, selling off
live games and highlights to various TV companies.
</P>
<P>
BT's spokesman insisted there was "no truth" in the report, but
the Premier League expects more speculation about big-money moves
to follow in the run-up to the negotiations.

QUITO, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadorian Foreign Minister
Benjamin Ortiz presented a new geographical map of the country on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, the diplomat said that the big
difference between the new map and its predecessors is that for
the first time in history, Ecuador is showing its closed borders,
without the broken lines which indicate protocols or unratified
agreements.
</P>
<P>
The new map shows the territorial extension of Ecuador to be
256,370 square kilometers, the official stated.
</P>
<P>
The map includes the maritime frontier, the Galapagos Islands,
climate transverse and longitudinal sections of the country, and
an illustration of the one square kilometer island called Tiwintza,
an Ecuadorian island within Peruvian limits.
</P>
<P>
In three months, the new maps will be distributed to
educational centers, public outlets and international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador and Peru signed a peace accord on October 26 in 1998,
ending the long-standing border disputes between the two countries

MEXICO CITY, November 24 (Xinhua) -- A series of accidents
killed seven people and injured others in the State of Mexico,
neighbor of the Mexican capital, said highway authorities
Wednesday.

trucks, a bus, and two cars, said the source.

The authorities of the Public and Transport Security Authority

visibility as a result of heavy fog and high speed of the vehicles.

hospitals in the north of the capital, on the border with the

<HEADLINE> UK Athletics Face Costly Drugs Case Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- UK Athletics are bracing
themselves for an expensive legal battle with European 200 meters
champion Dougie Walker after he questioned whether his drugs case
should be heard by an International Amateur Athletic Federation
arbitration panel.
</P>
<P>
Walker, who tested positive for the banned steroid nandrolone
almost a year ago, subsequently had the case against him dismissed
by a UK Athletics disciplinary panel.
</P>
<P>
However, the IAAF anti-doping commission took a different view,
decreeing there was a case to answer and their council referred
the matter to an arbitration panel last August.
</P>
<P>
A date for the hearing has still not been set - and if Walker
and his lawyer Nick Bitel get their way it will not proceed.
</P>
<P>
Bitel has confirmed that writs will be issued against both the
IAAF and UK Athletics, questioning the world governing body's
authority to send the case to arbitration.
</P>
<P>
But considering the fact that the legal expense of the Diane
Modahl drugs case was a major source in bankrupting UK Athletics'
predecessor, the British Athletic Federation, it seems another
costly court case would have a significant financial impact.
</P>
<P>
Walker's lawyers claim there is nothing in the rules of UK
Athletics which allows them to ban the Scot if ordered to do so by
the IAAF.
</P>
<P>
Ironically UK Athletics have supported Walker throughout his
case and intend being present when the arbitration panel meets.

<HEADLINE> Maier Outduels Von Gruenigen at Giant Slalom World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Olympic champion
Hermann Maier held off the charge of the title-holder Switzerland'
s Michael Von Gruenigen to win Wednesday's second giant slalom
race of the World Cup season.
</P>
<P>
They battled to the last gate until the "The Hermannator"
overcame the reigning World Cup champion in the discipline,
winning his second race in as many starts this season.
</P>
<P>
Maier paced the first run with a time of one minute 14.19
seconds, giving him a .38-second lead over Von Gruenigen.
</P>
<P>
Gruenigen replied with a seemingly flawless second run to post
a time of 1:18.19, the fastest time of the day.
</P>
<P>
But it was not enough as Maier's second leg timed 1:18.29 ,
just a tenth of a second slower to send him atop the podium with a
combined time of two minutes 32.48 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Von Gruenigen finished in 2:32.76, followed by Austrians
Andreas Schifferer and Stephan Eberharter in 2:33.63 and 2:34.09
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian Lasse Kjus, owner of five medals at the world
championships here last season, finished seventh with a time of 2:
35.05, more than 2.5 seconds off the pace. Teammate Kjetil Andre
Aamodt was sixth in 2:34.87.
</P>
<P>
The men's World Cup race schedule will resume after two
training days with the season opener of downhill competition on

<HEADLINE> Official: Manila Summit to Promote ASEAN Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The short-term goal of the
Third Informal Summit of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) scheduled for Sunday in Manila is to promote
closer financial and economic cooperation among its 10 members, a
senior Philippine official said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a media forum here Wednesday, Philippine Foreign
Secretary Domingo Siazon said this is the reason why the presence
of finance and economic ministers at the preparatory meetings for
the summit are inevitable.
</P>
<P>
Beginning on Thursday, ASEAN finance and economic ministers
will discuss proposals for the implementation of the ASEAN Free
Trade Area, the ASEAN Investment Area and the negotiations on
services, among others, he said.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said that the Manila summit is a historic event since
this will be the first time for ASEAN leaders and their economic
and finance ministers to meet after the region was hit by the
financial crisis which started in 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to a conference program, ASEAN finance ministers will
gather here Thursday for a special meeting, and they will join
foreign ministers and economic and trade ministers Friday for
another special meeting.
</P>
<P>
The synchronization of the economic, finance, trade ministers
meetings with that of foreign ministers underlines the linkage
between economic and political issues, Siazon said.
</P>
<P>
It also underscores the important approach that ASEAN seeks to
utilize in resolving vital problems affecting the region, he
added.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN, founded in 1967, now groups Brunei, Cambodia, Laos,
Myanmar, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam.

percent of its exports last year.

<HEADLINE> EU, Major Staging Post for Arms Brokering Deals: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 23 (Xinhua) - The European Union (EU) is a
major staging post for arms brokering deals in the world and the
dealers are making a fortune selling Cold War surplus arms, a
report on illegal weapons trafficking said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report, by the name of "The Arms Fixers: Controlling the
Brokers and Shipping Agents," said that urgent international
action should be taken to close loopholes and stop the trade,
which are estimated to cause about 90 percent of casualties in
conflicts
</P>
<P>
"Most Western European countries do not have controls over
third country arms brokering, no controls on other nationals or
their residents," Brian Wood, co-author of the report, told a
conference held in London to launch the book.
</P>
<P>
"From genocide in Rwanda to drug trafficking in Columbia, arms
brokers have been fueling conflicts and contributing to human
abuses around the world for decades," the conference said.
</P>
<P>
Commissioned by the British American Security Information
Council in London, the International Peace Research Institute in
Oslo and the Norwegian Initiative on Small Arms Transfers, the
report said that the European governments were often aware of the
problem of arms brokering in that region but had so far failed to
take enough action.
</P>
<P>
Speakers at the conference Wednesday urged the EU governments
to increase their controls on that worsening issue and to regulate
arms brokers.
</P>
<P>
"Arms brokers in Britain are driving coach and horses through
current arms trade regulations. Controlling their activities
provide a real opportunity to make up lost ground in the effort to
maintain a foreign policy with ethnical dimension," Menzies
Campbell, a British parliamentary member told the conference.
</P>
<P>
The book was especially launched Wednesday to meet a special
occasion. The EU Council of Ministers Working Group on Arms
prepares to reopen the debate on brokering Thursday.

<HEADLINE> German Banks Offer Fund to Rescue  Construction Giant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- German banks Wednesday promised
to inject 100 million marks as a first step to rescue Philipp
Holzmann AG, the country's endangered second biggest construction
firm, obviously under the pressure of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder succeeded in persuading some 10 major creditors of
Holzmann to set up a reconstruction fund aimed at resolving the
company's debts at a late evening emergent meeting in Frankfurt,
where Holzmann is based.
</P>
<P>
"The job places have been rescued," hailed Schroeder after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The package to rehabilitate Holzmann's finance and help the
company to escape the court-ruled insolvency proceedings will
totally require 300 million marks. The first 100 million marks
will be used in coming days to keep the over 1,000 idled building
sites in progress. ,
</P>
<P>
While arriving in Frankfurt and facing about 2,000
demonstrating Holzmann employees, Schroeder promised, " The
federal government will seek every possibility under the framework
of laws to secure job places."
</P>
<P>
And the government itself will take part in the rescue action,
he added, "we can not afford to lose even one job."
</P>
<P>
Nine days before, Holzmann shocked the market by announcing
further 2.4 billion marks in debts in its internal audit. The
company blamed the previous management and the projects in east
Germany for the problems.
</P>
<P>
With debts over assets, the company, which links with some 60,
000 jobs in Germany, has appealed its creditors for a rescue
package. The attempt was thwarted after the bankers failed to
reach an agreement on such a big sum.

<HEADLINE> Britain Expects Iraq Draft Resolution in UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Wednesday that
it is expecting a draft United Nations resolution on policy
towards Iraq to be ready for formal discussion within three weeks.
</P>
<P>
"I would hope that some time within the next two to three weeks
we would be in a position to bring forward a text for discussion
in the Security Council," Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said.
</P>
<P>
"We have come a long way over the past few months and have
reached agreement on most of the points of difference," said Cook,
referring to lengthy negotiations over a draft resolution put
forward by Britain and the Netherlands earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The five permanent members of the Security Council -- Britain,
China, France, Russia and the United States -- have been
deadlocked for months on how to set conditions for the easing of
sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
A major dispute among the major powers has been how much
progress in meeting Iraq's disarmament commitments must be made
before Baghdad qualifies for a suspension of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"We want to see a resumption of (weapons) inspections on the
ground and we want also to hold out the prospect to Iraq, if it
cooperates," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly refused Britain's proposal for resuming
arms inspections in Iraq.

 NEW YORK, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks moved
higher Wednesday as investors engaged in a heavy purchase for
technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 12.54 at 11,008.17.
The blue chip index fell 93.89 points Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP;Poor'
s 500 index rose 12.44 at 1,417.08 and the technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index rose 77.63 at 3,420.50, surpassing the record
closing high of 3,392.56 set on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The market fell initially after the Commerce Department
revised in a report the gross domestic product at 5.5 percent in
the third quarter, up from 4.8 percent reported earlier. The
revised growth rate, together with the falling in the number of
Americans filling for unemployment benefits last week, gave
investors an impression that the U.S. economy is not slowing
enough to ward off inflation despite a series of interest rate
increase.
</P>
<P>
 But by late morning, investors pursued stocks of tech
companies, driving the Nasdaq index to the new record and lifting
other indexes higher.
</P>
<P>
 Among the tech companies performing well were Intel, Amazon.
com and eToys. But IBM fell because The Wall Street Journal raised
questions about the company's accounting practice.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 2.49 at 639.63 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 2.29 at 825.15. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 1.48 at 455 93.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-7 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,676 down, 1,411 up and 475
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 732.97 million shares from 914.93
