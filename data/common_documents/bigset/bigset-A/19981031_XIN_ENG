STOCKHOLM -- At least 60 people were killed and 190 injured
when a fire broke out in a disco in the western Swedish city of
Gothenburg Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The blaze started about midnight when about 400 young people,
aged from 13 to 20, gathered for a Halloween party on the second
floor of the local Macedonian Association building. Most of those
present were immigrants from Macedonia or Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire is still unknown, but the police have not
ruled out arson. (Sweden-Fire-Toll)

JERUSALEM -- Palestinian security forces raided the house of
spiritual leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas Sheikh Ahmed
Yassin in Gaza Thursday night searching for a Palestinian
fugitive, Israel Radio reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The telephone line in Yassin's house was also cut off, the
radio said.
</P>
<P>
Yassin was not allowed out for prayer Friday since he was under
a house arrest placed by Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
Thursday, according to local radio and TV reports.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials said Yassin was confined to house arrest
"because his recent statements were against the Palestinian
national interests."
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented move, the first the PNA has taken against the
Hamas leader since he returned to Gaza in October 1997, was seen
as part of PNA's efforts to round up Hamas activists in the wake
of a suicide bombing Thursday in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli soldier was killed when a Palestinian car loaded
with explosives rammed into an Israeli military jeep escorting a
bus carrying about 40 children of settlers and blew up outside the
major Jewish settlement of Gush Katif. (Palestinians-Yassin-Raid)

<HEADLINE> Scientists Say Adult Brains Can Grow New Cells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Scientists from United
States and Sweden have found for the first time that adults
could grow new neurons or brain cells even at 60s and 70s.
</P>
<P>
This finding may bring a distant hope for treating brain
diseases or damages.
</P>
<P>
Reporting in the latest issue of Nature Medicine, researchers
from the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in U.S. Califonia
and the Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Goteborg, Sweden,
said the new neurons that form circuits were found in just one
small part of the brain--the hippocampus, a deep-brain structure
that is important for learning and memory.
</P>
<P>
They examined autopsy specimens from 5 people who had been
given a drug called BrdU because of cancer in their mouths or
throats. The drug is taken by dividing cells. Doctors had
administered it to see how rapidly the patients' tumors were
growing.
</P>
<P>
They reasoned that if cells in the brain were dividing to grow
new cells, they would take up the drug.
</P>
<P>
Eventually they found the drug in hippocampus of all the 5 people.
Among the 5 people, two were at the age of 50s, two at 60s and
one at 72.

<HEADLINE> Quebec's Liberals Facing Uphill Battle in Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Quebec's Liberal Party still has
a chance to win, even though the ruling Parti Quebecois (PQ) holds
the upper hand going into next month's election in the
French-speaking province of Canada, the lastest poll shows.
</P>
<P>
The survey, published Friday by the newspaper Gazette, pegs the
Liberal Party's popular support as of this week at 46.5 percent,
compared with 44.7 percent for the PQ.
</P>
<P>
The Action Democratique got 6.6 percent and the Equality Party
less than one percent. The remaining 1.4 percent was spread among
fringe parties.
</P>
<P>
But because of the uneven distribution of Liberal and PQ
support, such a count in practice would have produced another PQ
majority government had the election been held this week, said
Gilles Therrien, president of SOM polling firm that conducted the
survey.
</P>
<P>
The key PQ advantage is its significant lead among francophone
voters, who support the PQ by 53 percent to 38 percent for the
Liberals.
</P>
<P>
The Liberals are the overwhelming choice of the non-francophone
electorate, by 84 percent to 9.6 percent for the PQ, according to
the survey.
</P>
<P>
Quebec voters also have far more confidence in PQ leader Lucien
Bouchard as premier than in Liberal leader Jean Charest.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-nine percent were very or somewhat satisfied with
Bouchard's performance as premier, while 43 percent were generally
satisfied with Charest's performance in province politics.
</P>
<P>
The survey was compiled from interviews conducted from October
23 to 27, the day before the election was called, with a sample of
1,22 eligible voters across the province. It has a margin of error
of 3.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New Homes Sales Decline in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. new home sales fell
1 percent to a nine-month low in September, the third consecutive
drop after reaching the record high in June, the Commerce
Department said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
New single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 822,000, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
It was the longest declines since early 1995 and left the
inventory of unsold homes at 292,000, the highest level in 19
months.
</P>
<P>
The September decline was sharpest in the Midwest, 12.9 percent
to a rate of 175,000. Sales fell 5.5 percent in the West to
224,000, 3.3 percent in the South to 353,000 and 2.7 percent to
71,000 in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, sales had surged to a record 919,000 rate in June,
the highest on record since the department began tracking sales in
1963. The buying heat was attributed mainly to low mortgage rates
combined with strong job growth.
</P>
<P>
However, in recent months, the stock market's problems have
spooked some buyers, and economic and job growth has slowed
somewhat in response to Asia's economic slump.
</P>
<P>
The median price of a new home in September was 152,000 U.S.
dollars, up 3.9 percent from a year earlier.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government would be
striving to attain three major targets during the coming period,
Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the new cabinet after a mini reshuffle, Simitis said
that the first target was to maintain and increase the pace of the
upward and developmental course of the Greek economy, the ultimate
objective being the country's entry to the European Economic and
Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
The second was to strengthen Greece's role on the international
scene while the third was to improve the quality of life and deal
with Greek citizens' daily problems, particularly unemployment,
crime and issues concerning the country's health services, the
premier said.
</P>
<P>
As for the cabinet reshuffle last night, Simitis stressed that
this means the continuation of his government's task but at a more
intensive pace, with greater attention to problems, speed and
efficiency.

The move came after the lawyer of three French families,

extradition of Pinochet from Britain.

Pinochet was restored a half status of liberty on Friday by the

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economic Growth Rebounds in Third Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. economic growth moved
forward at a 3.3 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate in the
third quarter, the Commerce Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Affected by the world financial chaos, the economy grew at a
subdued 1.8 percent rate in the second quarter period after
soaring at a 5.5 percent rate during the first three months of the
year.
</P>
<P>
Exports fell at a 2.9 percent rate, the third consecutive
quarter of decline, while imports rose at a 3.4 percent rate. The
resulting deterioration in the trade deficit knocked nearly a
percentage point from the overall growth rate.
</P>
<P>
However, that wasn't as bad as the previous two quarters, when
the ballooning trade deficit reduced growth by more than two
percentage points in each.
</P>
<P>
Businesses turned cautious in the third quarter. Though
investment in new computers remained strong, overall spending on
new equipment increased at a 1.1 percent annual rate, the smallest
gain in nearly seven years. Spending on new buildings and
structures fell at a 6.5 percent rate, the worst showing in some 4
years.
</P>
<P>
Growth in housing construction dipped from a robust 15.3
percent in the first half of the year to a still-substantial 6.8
percent in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending, which represents about two-thirds of
economic activity, grew at a healthy 3.9 percent annual rate in
the third quarter, after shooting up at a 6.1 percent rate during
the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Third-quarter growth was heavily influenced by a shift in
inventory growth and by the General Motors strikes, which began in
June. Without a sharp slowdown in inventory accumulation in the
second quarter and a rebound in the third, the economy would have
grown at a 4.6 percent pace in the second and a 2.3 percent rate
in the third.
</P>
<P>
Auto production fell in both quarters. And, a decline in auto
sales in the third completely offset increased consumer spending
on other big-ticket durable goods. Thus, all the third-quarter
growth in consumer spending came in services and non-durable goods
such as food, fuel and clothing.
</P>
<P>
Government spending, meanwhile, grew at a 1.4 percent rate in
the third quarter, down from 3.7 percent in the second.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide inflation hit a 35-year low. Prices rose at an
0.8 percent annual rate. The various changes left the economy
producing goods and services in the third quarter at a 8.53
trillion U.S. dollar annual rate, unadjusted for inflation.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Economy Rebounds in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Canada's economy rebounded in
August after four months of decline, Statistics Canada said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 0.7 percent,
bringing the value of economic activity back to its previous peak
early this year.
</P>
<P>
"The primary factor underlying the correction was the recovery
from the effects of strikes in June and July," the statistics
agency said.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing output rose 2.8 percent following four months of
declines, with increases recorded in 16 of 22 groups.
</P>
<P>
Production of motor vehicles rose 24.4 percent, and production
of motor vehicle parts shot up 26.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Construction activity rebounded somewhat in the wake of strikes
in southern Ontario province, but the level of output is only back
to June levels, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Housing starts were up sharply in August, following four
consecutive months of decline.
</P>
<P>
In August, wholesaling activities declined by 0.3 percent,
further extending the period of lacklustre growth. Weakness was
widespread in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Retail trade sales slipped 0.2 percent, with supermarkets,
department and other stores reporting lower sales.

<HEADLINE> India Tightens Financial Market Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 30 ( Xinhua) -- India tightened operational
norms Friday for the financial market to insulate it from currency
crisis like those in East Asia while underplaying the inflationary
pressures by leaving "high money supply" in the economy untouched
in its busy season credit policy.
</P>
<P>
Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the central bank of the country,
announced that Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) would be raised from
the present eight percent to nine percent with effect from the
next financial year and brought income recognition in provisioning
norms for government guaranteed advances on par with other such
advances from the fiscal year 2000-01.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) reported from Mumbai, India's
financial city 1400 kilometers southwest of here, that RBI had
also introduced provisioning requirement for standard assets
effective from the financial year ending March 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Carrying forward the financial sector reforms through a phased
implementation of stricter provisioning norms for banks and
financial institutions as well as government securities to provide
for additional risk coverage, RBI left lending rates and cash
reserve ratio unchanged at nine and 11 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
PTI quoted RBI Governor Bimal Jalan as cautioning that it would
adopt tighter monetary stances if the inflation increases further
or in case of external pressures.
</P>
<P>
In his mid-year review of the monetary credit policy for
1998-99, Jalan said RBI had deliberately avoided monetary and
credit policy decisions in its review to make the event devoid of
any hype.
</P>
<P>
The Southeast Asian crisis had clearly influenced the
formulation of the busy season (October-March) credit policy by
the Indian central bank which sought to move towards full
disclosures and transparency in banking operations in line with
global practices.
</P>
<P>
Jalan expressed concern over the eight percent inflation rate,
saying that money supply growth was much higher than expected
growth of the economy and was inconsistent with the objective of
general price stability maintenance though the outlook for
industrial growth continued to be uncertain and external
environment was highly unfavorable.
</P>
<P>
The RBI governor advised banks to introduce effective risk
management systems to cover credit risk, market risk and
operational risk on a priority basis.
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive risk measurement approach should be adopted and
detailed structure of operating limits, guidelines and other
parameters should be put in place, he added.

<HEADLINE> UK House Prices Will Beat Inflation, Says Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- House prices in Britain will
continue to rise by more than inflation for several years,
according to report by investment bank Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
The report says the house prices compared with disposable
incomes look "pretty low", and as a proportion of total private
sector wealth, the value of residential property is lower than at
any time in the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch adds that worries that slowing population growth
and the increased burden of the welfare state will have a negative
effect on the housing market.
</P>
<P>
It expects house prices to rise by more than consumer price
inflation for the next few years, but by 2004 it expects prices to
cool off and there will be zero movement in house prices for a
couple of years.
</P>
<P>
But in the longer term, the report expects rises in house
prices of about 2 percent in real terms.

<P>
Nearly 48 percent of the civil disputes were settled through
negotiation. Through reconciliation, the courts assisted 8 percent

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Africa has the lowest Internet
usage in the world, accounting for only 800,000 or 0.54 percent
of the global Internet user population of about 150 million, a
Nigerian communications official has said.
</P>
<P>
Ogbonnaya Iromantu, Executive Vice-Chairman of the Nigerian
Communications Commission (NCC), said out of the figure, about
700,000 Internet users are in South Africa, 10,000 in Zimbabwe
and 7,000 in Ghana and Nigeria, The Guardian newspaper reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, he said, the United States has about 79 million
Internet users and Europe 34 million while Asia and Pacific have
24 million.
</P>
<P>
The NCC boss said the inadequate general level of
telecommunications facilities was clearly the most critical
inhibiting element to electronic information sharing in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said at the on-going Second International Conference on
Broadcasting in Africa held in Nigerian capital Abuja that Africa
spends about three billion U.S. Dollars to import
telecommunications equipment and some 600 million Dollars to
connect one African country to the other through European
countries every year.
</P>
<P>
This amount of money, he noted, is enough for some countries
to maintain sustainable development of their telecommunications
infrastructure and to develop local manufacturing competence in
the continent.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian official said the way to redress the situation
included support for technical training and skills as well as
development of access points and demand in secondary cities and
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The journey to full Internet connectivity in Nigeria has been
tortuous due to the different perceptions of the technology, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Congo (K) Rebel Leader Presses for Immediate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting rebel leader
Ernest Wamba dia Wamba of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
Friday pressed for face-to-face talks with DRC President Laurent
Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Pretoria, the administrative
capital of South Africa, Wamba dia Wamba warned that war in the
DRC could spread to the rest of Africa if peace negotiations were
not started immediately.
</P>
<P>
Wamba dia Wamba said Kabila should be responsible for
involving other countries in the war. "Peace will only be
possible when Kabila starts negotiation himself."
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader said he told South African President Nelson
Mandela Thursday that he would opt for a ceasefire as long as
Kabila responded positively to peace negotiation.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his forces would not mind if Mandela became
involved in the peace process as long as he could achieve direct
negotiations between the rebels and Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The South African government has renewed its effort for peace
settlement of the DRC conflict, which started in early August.
</P>
<P>
Following his talks with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and
Rwandan Vice President Paul Kagame last week, Mandela also
exchanged views with Namibian President Sam Nujoma over the DRC
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Namibia, together with Zimbabwe, Angola and Chad, have
deployed thousands of troops in the DRC to help Kabila's
government quell rebels. Meanwhile, Uganda and Rwanda have been
accused by the DRC government of supporting rebels in vast
central African country.

</P>
<P>
The ANC's botched court bid also revealed a division within
the party. Some party officials said the decision to take the
TRC issue to court appeared to have been the decision of a small
leadership group, and some of the ANC's top officials had been
left in the dark about the plan.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's spokesman said Thursday that the state president had
not been consulted on the court move beforehand. While receiving
the report from Tutu, Mandela said he accepted the report with
all its imperfections, as an aid to help the people of the
country to reconcile and build the nation.
</P>
<P>
Two party officials who had been most closely involved in TRC
issues -- Justice Minister Dullah Omar and Premier Mathews Phosa
of Mpumalanga Province, were reportedly only notified of the
decision to take court action. Their opinion on the matter was
not sought. Both men participated on behalf of the ANC in
drafting the law setting up the TRC.
</P>
<P>
Some ANC parliament members said the court bid to suppress
criticism was a mistake, which could damage ANC's reputation at
home and abroad for fair-mindedness and a willingness to face up
to the past.
</P>
<P>
The ANC's wrangle with the TRC seems not yet close to an end.
The party's objection to the TRC findings has given rise to calls
for a general amnesty for apartheid-era human rights violations,
regardless of whether they have satisfied the TRC's requirements
for amnesty.
</P>
<P>
The ANC, which rejected a blanket amnesty in the
constitutional talks, is now caught in a dilemma.
</P>
<P>
After the TRC's amnesty committee has ended its hearings in
four months and all the TRC's work has been completed, the ANC
could see some of its senior members facing lengthy criminal
prosecutions and civil suits for human rights abuses named in the
TRC report.
</P>
<P>
The amnesty committee is yet to deal with the amnesty
applications by 37 ANC leaders, including Mbeki and five cabinet
ministers.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties, many of whose members are also threatened
by possible prosecutions, said a general amnesty is needed to
finally close the book on the past, which the TRC process was
intended to bring about.
</P>
<P>
But a blanket amnesty could meet strong opposition from
victims of human rights abuses and from those who want to defend
the TRC process.

ATHENS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Financial Crimes Squad
(SDOE) of Greece's Finance Ministry Friday seized a great quantity
of contraband cigarettes in Piraeus, about 15 kilometers west of
Athens.

<P>
This is the largest single haul of smuggled cigarettes ever
found in Greece.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: ANC's Row With Truth Body Backfires (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 30 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling
African National Congress (ANC) is counting the cost of a lost
battle against the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC)
which found the party guilty of human rights atrocities during
the apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
Some ANC senior officials have voiced their concern that the
failed attempt may tarnish the image of the party.
</P>
<P>
The ANC's last-minute attempt to halt the publication of the
TRC findings failed Thursday after a Cape Town High Court judge
dismissed the party's application for an interdict.
</P>
<P>
Two hours after the ruling, TRC Chairman Desmond Tutu handed
the 3,500-page report to President Nelson Mandela, and
simultaneously it was released to the world through media and the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
The report, compiled after 30 months of hearings and
investigations by the commission, found the ANC "morally and
politically responsible for gross human rights abuses" committed
during the anti-apartheid struggle.
</P>
<P>
It held the party accountable for killings of civilians in its
military operations, bombings and assassinations, and for the
injuries and deaths of civilians in its 1985-1987 landmine
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The ANC was also found guilty of killing 76 Inkatha Freedom
Party officials, and torturing and killing its own members in
foreign military camps who were suspected to be informers of the
apartheid state.
</P>
<P>
The TRC in its report blamed the ANC for "creating a climate"
in which supporters believed their illegal actions were
legitimate within the parameters of "people's war" promoted by
the party.
</P>
<P>
Though conceding the ANC's status as part of a legitimate
liberation movement, the commission said "a just war" could not
justify unjust means.
</P>
<P>
The ANC's decision Wednesday evening to apply for an urgent
court interdict to prevent the whole TRC report from being
published caught the whole nation by shock, not least the TRC.
</P>
<P>
The ANC was one of the major proponents of the founding of a
special court to address the injustice during the apartheid
years. It insisted that victims of human rights violations in the
past should be given some kind of recognition and compensation.
</P>
<P>
The TRC was set up in 1995 as a result of a compromise made by
all sides in the multi-party constitutional talks in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
Tutu severely criticized the ANC for the legal action. In a
television interview Thursday night, Tutu said the ANC should not
expect special treatment and could not order the TRC to change
findings just because it was the ruling party.

<HEADLINE> G7 Unveils Action Plan on Global Financial Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Group of Seven (G7) major
industrialized nations Friday unveiled a package of far-reaching
reforms designed to "strengthen the global financial system".
</P>
<P>
British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, whose country
is the current G7 president, said that the measures aim to keep a
tighter check on destabilizing flows of hot money and to head off
future economic crises.
</P>
<P>
"We must do more to build a modern framework for the global
markets of the 21st century and to limit the swings of boom and
bust that destroy hope and diminish wealth," Brown said.
</P>
<P>
The G7 joint proposals are:
</P>
<P>
--Setting up a new IMF (International Monetary Fund) fund worth
90 billion U.S. dollars for emergency lending to stop a crisis
spreading into other economies.
</P>
<P>
-- Tighter regulation of the world's international capital
markets to prevent repeat of the recent financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
-- Setting up a code of practice for private banks and
businesses, designed to regulate highly leveraged companies like
hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
-- Formulating "transparency rules" for companies to make
finaNcial transactions and dangers to the markets more visible.
</P>
<P>
-- Setting up an international code of conduct for monetary and
financial policy in G7 countries and new rules for monitoring
international capital flows.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Moldova Agree to Continue Troop Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov and his Moldovan counterpart, Ion Ciubuc, agreed here
Friday to continue the withdrawal of Russian troops from Moldova.
</P>
<P>
According to a communique issued after the talks, the two
premiers agreed that the pullout of the former 14th Russian army
would proceed as necessary conditions are created.
</P>
<P>
The troops, stationed in the Moldova's Dniester region
dominated by ethnic Russians, was once a focus of tension between
Moscow and Kishinev. In October 1994, the two countries reached
agreement on the troops pullout.
</P>
<P>
In Friday's talks, the two leaders pledged to continue efforts
toward an early political settlement of the Dniester conflict and
defining the status of the Dniester region while preserving
Moldova's independence and territorial integrity, Itar-Tass
reported.
</P>
<P>
During Ciubuc's two-day working visit, the two countries also
signed a number of agreements on border cooperation, delivery of
food products in exchange for Russian military services,
establishment of cultural centers.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS to Set Up Mediation Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A mediation and security council
will be established under a draft mechanism for conflict
prevention, management and resolution for the west African
region, the New Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
NAN quoted sources in capital Abuja as saying that foreign
ministers of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) discussed the situation in Guinea Bissau as well as the
crisis in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
At the just-ended meeting, foreign ministers discussed the
sub-regional draft mechanism which was proposed by ministers of
defense, internal affairs and security at their July meeting in
Banjul, the Gambia.
</P>
<P>
The mechanism provides for the establishment of the mediation
council comprising nine member countries which will take
emergency decisions on threats to the sub-regional security on
behalf of member countries.
</P>
<P>
The council whose members will be elected for a two-year term
will be complemented by a council of elders whose members are
required to play the role of mediator and arbiter on such
threats.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, foreign ministers endorsed the name ECOMOG
(west African peacekeeping force) to designate the military
instrument of ECOWAS which has been used as an ad hoc force for
the restoration of peace in Liberia and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Cote d'Ivoire, the Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Mali and Niger have
pledged additional troops for ECOMOG at the request of ECOWAS.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers urged member countries to convene a
meeting of their military experts to determine their needs for
submission to donor organizations and ensure collective
definition of the responsibility of such troops.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Gets $51 Million as Cotton Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has earned 51
million U.S. Dollars from exporting 36,200 tons of cotton lint by
the end of September as the 1998/99 cotton buying season is in
full swing.
</P>
<P>
The east African state got 91.4 million Dollars from exports
of 60,938 tons of cotton lint during the 1997/98 buying season,
usually from July to October, newspapers here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
They quoted an official of the Tanzania Cotton Lint and Seed
Board as saying that from the 1994/95 season to present, the
country has earned a total of 392.6 million Dollars from
exporting a total of 259,763 tons of cotton lint.
</P>
<P>
Known as "white gold" for its clear white color, Tanzania's
cotton lint, mainly produced in the western regions of Shinyanga,
Mwanza and Mara, is exported mainly to Indonesia, Malaysia,
Italy, South Africa and Portugal as well as Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> S. African Job Summit Agrees on Action Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 30 (Xinhua) -- South African government,
business and labor Friday agreed on a broad action plan to tackle
the country's gigantic problem of unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The action plan included an ambitious housing project, an
adjustment of the country's macro-economic strategy, a
strengthening of customs control and a dramatic expansion of
state-backed job creation programs.
</P>
<P>
In a 94-page declaration, participants of Friday's
presidential job summit committed themselves to addressing
joblessness, now officially at 33 percent or 4.67 million people.
</P>
<P>
The declaration commits government to reviewing its growth,
employment and redistribution (Gear) macro-economic policy. It
concedes Gear's targets would not be met.
</P>
<P>
"Adjustments to this are necessary, and detailed work will be
done to address these changed circumstances while retaining the
coherence and strength of our policy," the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address, Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin
indicated a substantive review of Gear could be under
consideration. While government still believed Gear's objectives
were correct, the policy itself may not be sustainable, he said.
</P>
<P>
The most substantive job creation measure announced at the
summit was a national project aimed at building 150,000 houses
for low-income families by December 2001.
</P>
<P>
The first phase was expected to yield about 50,000 houses and
to cost 2.5 billion Rand (440 million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The program will be jointly funded by government, labor and
business. About 75 percent of the houses will be rented out, and
the rest sold.
</P>
<P>
Participants agreed to embark on a "buy South Africa" campaign
as soon as possible to promote demand for local products and
services.
</P>
<P>
It was agreed that the flow of illegal imported goods into
South Africa had to be curbed, and that customs control had to be
strengthened. The government has allocated 734.7 million Rand
(129 million Dollars) for this purpose over a five-year period.
</P>
<P>
Among the agreements reached after months of negotiations is a
framework for a social plan aimed at avoiding job losses wherever
possible, and on a comprehensive social security system for the
poor and unemployed. An investigation into the feasibility of a
basic income grant is to be undertaken.

<HEADLINE> Reconciliation Plan for Bissau to Be Tabled at </HEADLINE>

<P>
LAGOS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Guinea Bissau President Joao
Bernardo Vieira and rebel leader General Ansumane Mane have
agreed to put a reconciliation plan to the 21st summit of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Friday quoted Gambian Foreign
Minister Sedate Jobe as saying that the accord followed talks in
Banjul, the Gambia Thursday on ending the four-month conflict
in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
Gambian President Yahya Jammeh would accompany Vieira and Mane
to the summit which was scheduled to open Friday in Nigerian
capital Abuja, said Jobe, who described the accord as "a great
success for Gambia and a great success for Africa".
</P>
<P>
Mane rebelled on June 2 with the backing of a large part of
the army after being dismissed as army chief by Vieira on
suspicion of smuggling arms to separatist rebels in neighboring
Casamance, southern Senegal.
</P>
<P>
A cease-fire was declared in August and held until mid-October
when clashes between the two sides broke out again.
</P>

MAPUTO, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Ministry of
Environmental Co-ordination issued a press communique here Friday
canceling its decision which allows the International Waste Group

<P>
According to the Mozambique News Agency, the government

</P>
<P>
The ministry explained in the communique that the Environment
Law passed in October 1997 prohibits importing waste or garbage
which may be harmful to the country.
</P>
<P>
Under this law, it is illegal to import, export, transport or
store waste within the Mozambican territories. Therefore, the
previous decision is also illegal and should be invalid.

<P>
HARARE, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe said Thursday the allied forces in the embattled
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) will continue to defend the
vast central African country.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Zimbabwe national news agency ZIANA,
Mugabe said the only way toward bringing total peace and
stability to President Laurent Kabila's government was to
continue defending the DRC "vigorously."
</P>
<P>
"The way forward is to continue to defend the DRC vigorously,
which we are doing, and knock sense into the minds of those who
are intransigent," said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has more than 6,000 soldiers in the DRC, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
ZIANA said Mugabe's comments came in the wake of the collapse
of talks by the region's defense and foreign ministers held in
Lusaka on Monday and Tuesday in a bid to end fighting in Congo
(K).

<HEADLINE> WTO Chief Stresses Collective Leadership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Director-General Renato Ruggiero
of the World Trade Organization (WTO), on Friday stressed the
importance of "collective leadership" as a new approach to
challenges facing the global economy.
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero, addressing a conference on "trade, investment and
environment" at the British Royal Institute of International
Affairs, said the current financial crisis marks "an important
turning point" in the process of globalization, and "a new
international consensus will have to develop for improving the
management of the global economy if we are to continue to
liberalize markets, and if globalization is to fulfil its
promise."
</P>
<P>
"We need to open up the international system to wider
participation at the highest level of the decision-making
process," he said. "This implies that we must move from a
predominantly unilateral leadership to a more collective
leadership, with a more balanced share of responsibility."
</P>
<P>
"What we need is an architecture which will take into account,
at the highest political level, a number of players which goes
beyond a few industrialized countries, and includes developing
countries and economies in transition."
</P>
<P>
Also, an increasing number of issues have to be taken into
account in the globalized world so as to develop a more balanced
and global vision to accommodate a more complex and
technology-driven global system, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the negative effect of the financial crisis on
world trade, investment and development, Ruggiero said "Declining
commodity prices, weakening imports in the affected countries,
excessive export competition in the advanced markets, and the
threat of further devaluations -- all of these forces are
introducing new uncertainties, new risks and new protectionist
pressures into the global economy."
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "If we consider the present financial turmoil
it seems that an answer cannot be found unless we keep our markets
open. At the same time, it will be increasingly difficult to
resist protectionist pressure without restoring stability to the
financial and exchange rates systems."
</P>
<P>
"Globalization has enormous potential to generate growth, to
spread the benefits of technology and to weave a more stable
planet, but it also challenges the status quo," he noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Former Chilean president Augusto
Pinochet was granted conditional bail by the British High Court in
London Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, Judge Stephen Richards agreed to the bail plea only on
two conditions -- that Pinochet reside "at all times" in London's
Grovelands hospital and that he be "guarded by police at all
times".
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, who was arrested by British police on alleged
involvement in genocide and torture of Spanish citizens early this
month, won a major legal battle Wednesday when the High Court said
his former status as head of state gave him immunity from
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Early this week, Pinochet was moved from the London Clinic,
where he had his back operation, to the Grovelands Priory
Hospital, an exclusive psychiatric clinic.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Chilean air force jet is waiting at an airport in
Oxfordshire, central England, ready to whisk Pinochet away should
he be freed by the courts.

<HEADLINE> 21st ECOWAS Summit Opens in Abuja </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, Nigeria, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The 21st summit of the
Economic Community of the West African States (ECOWAS) opened in
Nigerian capital Abuja Friday to discuss the economic and
political situation in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Making the welcome speech, Nigerian Head of State and current
chairman of the ECOWAS, General Abdulsalam Abubakar said it is
the first time on the continent that leaders of different
sub-regional bodies were together to share their experiences on
political and economic development and thus strengthen the
efforts to bring about the renewed African Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar noted that various economies in the West African
sub-region have managed to maintained a level of stability since
1993 despite armed conflicts in some member countries.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the growth rate in 1997 for the whole
sub-region was 4.3 percent, as against 4.2 in the previous year,
</P>
<P>
He expressed the optimism that the growth rate which has been
on the rise since 1993 will continue to increase in the years
ahead.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar announced that significant progress has been made in
the various aspects of sub-regional economic integration,
including the ECOWAS travelers' check and the West African Gas
Pipeline Project will deliver Nigeria's rich natural gas
resources to neighboring Benin, Ghana, Togo and probably Cote
d'lvoire.
</P>
<P>
He urged member countries to remove various illegal check
points on their borders so that the free movement of persons and
goods within the sub-region which has been in effect since 1980
would be faithfully implemented,
</P>
<P>
Abubakar also urged member countries to approve the protocol
establishing the 0,5 percent Community Levy on imports from
non-member countries to relieve the fund shortage of the ECOWAS,
which was hindering the implementation of its many programs.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the 16 member countries, Secretary-General of the
African Unity Organization (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim and a
representative of the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan
were at the opening ceremony at the ECOWAS Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Also present were South African President Nelson Mandela, who
was representing the South African Development Community, and a
representative of Zambian President Fredrick Chiluba, chairman of
the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the ECOWAS chairman also expressed his concern
over the conflicts in Guinea Bissau, the Great Lakes region and
other parts of the continent.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar called for the establishment of a permanent mechanism
for conflict prevention, management and resolution in the
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
His proposal received support from OAU chief Salim, who also
spoke on the occasion, and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
whose representative delivered a message on his behalf.

<HEADLINE> Russian Duma Delegation to Visit Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A Russian Duma delegation is
expected to visit Iraq in days for discussions with Iraqi
officials on measures to help lift the eight-year-old U.N. embargo
off Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is to be headed by Duma (lower house of
parliament) Vice-Chairman Mikhail Gutsiriyev, the Iraqi News
Agency INA reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The press secretary of Duma Vice-Chairman Office told INA that
the proposed visit comes within preparations for expanding
parliamentary relations between Russia and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Duma has long been calling for the lifting of sanctions
imposed on Iraq in August 1990 following its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
INA said the Russian Duma delegation will include Chairman
of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party Vladimir Zhirinovsky who
proposed to send Russian navy to the Persian Gulf during last
February's weapons inspection crisis between Iraq and the U.N..
</P>
<P>
In the crisis, the United States and Britain threatened to
launch air strikes against Iraq to force it into agreeing to open
its presidential sites to U.N. weapons inspectors. The crisis was
peacefully solved in last minute during U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan's Baghdad trip.
</P>
<P>
Before heading for Baghdad, the Russian Duma delegation is
expected to stop in Tehran to hold talks with a number of
Iranian officials, said INA.

<HEADLINE> Jubilee 2000 Debt Campaign Launched in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Jubilee 2000, a worldwide
campaign for total cancellation of the unpayable of external debt
of poor countries has been officially launched here Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Spearheaded by the Uganda Debt Network (UDN), a coalition of
non-governmental organizations, individuals and institutions, the
campaign is aimed at ensuring that poor people can have a
debt-free start in the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
A UDN report says the third world countries owe over 2.2
trillion U.S. Dollars to international creditors. Sub-Sahara
Africa owes over 235 billion Dollars while the external debt of
Uganda alone reaches over 3.6 billion Dollars to the
international community.
</P>
<P>
The UDN was formed in 1996 when the external debt burden of
third world countries and its adverse impact on social and
economic development became a critical issue of concern.
</P>
<P>
Figures of UDN show that in 1980 Uganda's debt stock stood at
689 million Dollars. Over 76 percent of Uganda's debt is owed to
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Uganda pays over 140 million Dollars in debt service annually.
Every child, woman, man owes over nine Dollars in debt service
per person while it spends only 3.95 Dollars on health per
person.
</P>
<P>
The Jubilee 2000 Global Campaign is a worldwide movement that
was launched in 1996 in the United Kingdom by a group of
church-related organizations, trade unions, civic groups,
academicians and research institutions.

<HEADLINE> Debt Is Major Obstacle to Development: Ugandan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan First Lady Janet
Museveni said Friday that the massive external debt constitutes
the major obstacle to the sustainable economic development of
poor countries.
</P>
<P>
The first lady made the remarks when launching the Jubilee
2000 Debt Campaign here Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The most painful thing with the external debt burden is the
fact that it mostly affects children because they grow up stunted
and eventually fail to attain education.
</P>
<P>
Janet said globally, environmental degradation has escalated
as poor people try to cope with the harsh conditions of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Some countries are blamed for failure to use the borrowed
money wisely. She called on third world countries to exhibit
maturity in the way they manage their affairs to inspire
confidence in their lenders and the international community as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
She told the conference that Uganda has already embarked on
this new road and that the money saved from the debt relief
initiative amounting to 650 million U.S. Dollars has been put to
alleviate poverty in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to a report here, each year the third world pays the
West three times more in debt repayments than it receives in aid.
</P>
<P>
Of the 32 countries classified as Highly Indebted Poor
Countries, 25 are in sub-Sahara Africa. The huge debt is a
staggering burden for poor but developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Ugandans Urged to Maintain Roads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Prime Minister Kintu
Musoke has called for serious efforts in the districts to ensure
that all categories of roads are in a serviceable condition at
all times.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister issued the call when opening a two-day road
strategy workshop here recently, Radio Uganda reported Friday
evening.
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitation, upgrading and maintenance of roads will
continue to rank high in the government's top priorities, he
said.
</P>
<P>
A good road network is important for Uganda's development
because roads account for over 90 percent of the movement of the
country's goods.
</P>
<P>
At the workshop, Minister of Works, Housing and Communications
John Nasasira asked district leaders to stop awarding themselves
feeder road contracts because they cannot supervise themselves.
</P>
<P>
Grants from the central government for roads in the districts
will be suspended if the rule is not adhered to, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Most feeder roads in Uganda were seriously destroyed by the
heavy rains last year. The poor conditions of roads denied local
produce's easy access to markets and pose a big challenge to the
country's trade and security.

<HEADLINE> West African travelers' Checks Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, Nigeria, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The much-expected West
African travelers' checks were launched Friday in Nigerian
capital Abuja at the opening ceremony of the 21st summit of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the Committee of Governors of ECOWAS
Central Banks, governor of the Nigerian Central Bank Paul Oguwuma
said the event is a major step towards ECOWAS's goal of building
a single monetary zone by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The check is issued by the West African Monetary Agency
(WAMA), formerly the West African Clearing House, under the
auspices of the above-mentioned ECOWAS committee. It is designed
to promote and facilitate trade, tourist and other service
transactions within the West African sub-region.
</P>
<P>
According to Oguwuma, it should be seen as the precursor of
the future common currency of ECOWAS countries. He urged all
member central banks to make their best endeavors to facilitate
the widespread use of the travelers' checks to foster the
intra-regional payment system.
</P>
<P>
The travelers' check is denominated in 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100
West African Units of Account (WAUA). A WAUA is equivalent to
1.36 U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The check is fully convertible into national currencies of
ECOWAS's 16 member countries, the rate of which will be published
by the WAMA weekly, said Oguwuma.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia's Economic Adjustment Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Minister of
Finance Sufian Ahmed said Friday that the government of Ethiopia
has recently adopted a new medium-term economic adjustment
program for 1998/99-2000/01.
</P>
<P>
Opening the eighth annual conference of the Ethiopian Economic
Association in Nazareth, 90 kms southeast of Addis Ababa,
Minister Sufian said the program aims at reducing poverty through
broad-based economic growth in a stable macro-economic
environment, according to the Ethiopian News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Sufian noted that the program will also design policies to
maintain financial stability and further deregulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
In Addition, Sufian said the adjustment program specifies
sectoral policies and strategies that are deemed to enhance
macro-economic stability and growth.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that major elements of the program include,
among others, the acceleration of privatization, further
liberalization of the exchange regime, civil service reform and
rehabilitation of the environment.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the program envisages an average
annual growth rate of real gross domestic product (GDP) at seven
percent, annual average rate of inflation at three percent,
external current account deficit at about nine percent of the
GDP, and the net foreign asset of the banking system on average
at four months import.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that the government will further
encourage private investment to attain the afore-mentioned
targets.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference is being held under the theme "the
Ethiopian economy: performance and evaluation".
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier report here, the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved the program and will finance 42
million U.S. Dollars in 1998/99 financial year ending July 7,
1999 in support of the program.

<HEADLINE> Angola Sees 400,000 More Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Angola has seen 400,000 more
refugees due to the unstable military situations in the
past seven months, a senior official said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Albino Malunge, Minister of Social Welfare and Assistance,
made the remarks during his meeting with visiting chairman of
Namibian National Committee (parliament) Kandy Nehiva.
</P>
<P>
Many civilians have fled their homes since March when the
peace process hit snags and more reported raids on common people
were mounted by the fighters of the National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), Malunge said.
</P>
<P>
There are still one million internally displaced people
waiting to be settled in the country, with the hardest hit area
being the Malanje Province in the northwest, he said.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of the emergency fund from the international
community has been used for refugees settlement, leaving little
for development, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
For this, he said, the government has suspended its efforts to
repatriate the refugees abroad, since 34,000 out of the 120,000
refugees having returned to Angola are waiting to be settled.
</P>
<P>
There are still tens of thousands of Angolan refugees in
Namibia, said Malunge, who hoped that the Namibian government
could understand this situation and continue to take care of the
displaced Angolans.
</P>
<P>
Nehiva arrived in Luanda last Saturday for a week-long visit.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Friday sent a congratulatory message to John Glenn,
an outgoing U.S. senator who returned to space after 36 years at
the age of 77, saying he has become "a pioneer for longevity."
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his spokesman's office, Annan said,
"On behalf of the United Nations, congratulations on yet another
triumph in a long and heroic career. The world knows you as a
pioneer of the space age."
</P>
<P>
Annan said in the statement, "You have now become a pioneer for
longevity. Returning to outer space at age 77, you are helping to
launch the United Nations International Year of Older Persons, to
be celebrated in 1999."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.N. chief voiced his "best wishes for a safe
return," saying that "the United Nations is with you all the way."
</P>
<P>
Cheered on by an enthralled nation, Glenn blasted off from the
U.S. Kennedy Space Center at 2:19 p.m. EST (1919 GMT) to become
the oldest person to fly in space -- more than twice the age of
the youngest of his six fellow crew members.
</P>
<P>
Glenn was the first U.S. astronaut to orbit the earth in 1962.
</P>
<P>
During the nine-day mission, the outgoing senator from Ohio,
the U.S., who lobbied for years to get the American space
authorities to let him fly again, will be a guinea pig for
experiments in the ageing process. He will give daily blood
samples for muscle wasting studies and sleep in a cap wired to
measure his brain waves.

CAIRO, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni Foreign Minister Abdul
Qader Ba-Jammal said here Friday that his trip to Egypt has
reflected the keenness of the two countries on promoting bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon arrival for a three-day visit,
Ba-Jammal said that he will hold talks with his Egyptian
counterpart Amr Moussa on bilateral relations and regional issues

</P>
<P>
Ba-Jammal, also Yemen's deputy prime minister, said that during

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 30 (xinhua) -- The impact of
globalization and liberalization on the countries is complex,
varied and uneven, China said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 53rd session of the U.N.General Assembly,
Chinese delegate Yuan Shaofu said the weak economic foundation of
the developing countries and their inferior competitive position
dictated that in the short and medium term, they would benefit
little from liberalization, with the Least Developed Countries at
particular risk of being further marginalized.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Shaofu said the Asian financial crisis gave a cautionary
story about the bumpy road taken by the developing countries in
their effort to open up their markets and showed the negative
impact of and unpredictable risks associated with globalization
and liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Yuan said that as an important tool in promoting globalization
and liberalization, the Multilateral Trading System had played a
role in settling international trade disputes and reducing general
tariff levels.
</P>
<P>
However, Yuan said, as proved by the fact, the present system
had neither solved a number of critical problems involved in
international trade nor reflected in a balanced way the interests
of all sides.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Commemorative Stamps Launched in Abuja </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, Nigeria, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A set of two
commemorative stamps on the west African peace-keeping force
ECOMOG were launched Friday at the opening ceremony of the summit
of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) here.
</P>
<P>
The stamps, one carrying the national flags of ECOWAS's 16
member countries and denominated 50 Naira (one U.S. Dollar equals
to 85 Naira), and another depicting the warship used for ECOMOG
operations and denominated five Naira, are produced by the
Nigerian Ministry of Communications.
</P>
<P>
All the other 15 member countries are also expected to issue
similar stamps to commemorate EC0MOG's eight years of successful
operation.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG was first formed in 1990 to intervene in the Liberian
civil war. It has successfully brought an end to the war and
eventually led to a free and fair election, from which emerged
the government of Charles Taylor.
</P>
<P>
After the coup in May 1997 in Sierra Leone, ECOMOG troops were
sent there, where it also succeeded by ousting the military junta
of Major Paul Johnny Koroma and reinstating elected civilian
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
Today, ECOMOG troops are still fighting the remnants of Koroma
and his ally of the Revolutionary united Front who wage a
guerrilla warfare in the mountainous areas in eastern Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
And with the four-month-old conflicts in Guinea Bissau between
President Joao Bernardo Vieira and uprising army general Ansumane
Mane, the on-going ECOWAS summit is expected to discuss the
possibility of deploying ECOMOG to that troubled member state.
</P>
<P>
According to Canice Umenwaliri, the Nigerian Minister of
Communications, who spoke on the launching ceremony, ECOMOG is
now "universally recognized as one of the most successful
sub-regional efforts of its kind ever mounted in Africa or
elsewhere in the world."
</P>
<P>
The stamps, he said, highlight for posterity, the sacrifice
and achievement of ECOMOG in Liberia and Sierra Leone and is also
another way of expressing the appreciation of the government and
people of Nigeria to ECOMOG participants.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria contributed most of the troops and resources to
ECOMOG. Ten other ECOWAS member countries as well as Uganda and
Tanzania also contributed troops.
</P>
<P>
All these countries as well as the nine successive commanders
of ECOMOG were awarded at the ceremony held at the ECOWAS
Secretariat in Abuja.

U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson found "a prima facie
violation" of grand jury secrecy rules starting January 21, the
day the Monica Lewinsky scandal erupted in news reports.
</P>
<P>
Some of the reports over the following five months referred to
"federal law enforcement sources" and "sources close to
independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr" as providing the
information.
</P>
<P>
Johnson noted that a television network news report "explicitly
identifies `prosecutors' as disclosing evidence gathered as part
of the grand jury investigation."
</P>
<P>
The story was a January 22 account on NBC of the "talking
points" document that Lewinsky said she wrote so that friend Linda
Tripp could provide testimony in the Paula Jones case that would
be helpful to President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"This evidence, the `talking points' document, was likely to be
presented to the grand jury," Johnson wrote. "The law in this
circuit makes it perfectly clear that government attorneys may not
reveal documentary evidence that is likely to be presented to the
grand jury."
</P>
<P>
In the September 24 decision, made public Friday, Johnson
ordered that an outside expert be appointed to assist her
investigation into whether Starr's office illegally leaked grand
jury evidence.
</P>
<P>
"Due to serious and repetitive prima facie violations" of grand
jury secrecy rules, "a complete and thorough review of these
allegations must be undertaken," the judge wrote.
</P>
<P>
The outside expert, whose name was deleted from the newly
released papers, has wide-ranging authority to subpoena documents
from Starr's office and question current or former members of
Starr's staff.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Privatize Kilimanjaro Int'l Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Kilimanjaro Airport
Development Company (KADCO) is scheduled to take over the
state-owned Kilimanjaro International Airport (KIA) in north
Tanzania next month.
</P>
<P>
The company will invest between 25 and 27 billion Shillings
(between 37 and 40 million U.S. Dollars) in two years, Director
of Planning and Research at the Ministry of Communications and
Transport Abisai N. Temba told reporters Friday.
</P>
<P>
Temba said that the investment will be made in, among other
things, the refurbishment of the entire runway, apron, taxi way,
rehabilitation of the terminal building and improvement of the
navigation aids.
</P>
<P>
Money will also be spent on building a 200-room tourist hotel
in the vicinity of KIA, he said, adding that the first guest is
expected to enter the hotel before June of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
KADCO is a locally registered company formed by Messrs Mott
McDonald International of Britain, which negotiated with the
Tanzanian government over a period and signed a 25-year
concession agreement last year.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, he said, within 20 months from the
initial date of cooperation, KADCO should advertize KIA in
international newspapers, magazines and electronic media
throughout the world in order to attract traffic business.
</P>
<P>
He said that traffic control at the airport will be exercised
by KADCO while upper air aircraft management will fall under the
Civil Aviation Authority.
</P>
<P>
According to plans the would-be KIA owner is also expected to
put up an 18-hole golf course in the vicinity of the airport, the
ministry director noted.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a statement issued by the ministry said KIA will be
the first international airport to be privatized in eastern and
southern Africa. The government will entrust the existing assets
to KADCO in exchange for a minority share-holding in KADCO.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that this demonstrates the commitment of
the government to work with international investors to improve
the quality of national infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
A modern and vibrant international airport in Kilimanjaro will
boost the development of tourism in the northern circuit of
Tanzania, ministry officials said.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Extends MINURSO's Mandate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Friday unanimously adopted a resolution, extending the
mandate of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in
Western Sahara (MINURSO) until December 17.
</P>
<P>
The resolution reiterated the Security Council's commitment "to
assist the parties to achieve a just and lasting solution to the
question of Western Sahara."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council adopted the resolution after its
closed-door consultations on a report presented by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who proposed a green light to the
identification of potential voters in three tribal groups in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The 470-member MINURSO has been stationed in the territory for
the past seven years. Its current mandate expires on October 31.
</P>
<P>
The resolution welcomed "the stated intentions of the
Government of Morocco and the Polisario Front to cooperate
actively with the MINURSO in implementing the proposals" contained
in Annan's report.
</P>
<P>
The resolution called on the parties concerned to agree by
mid-November on a package, which covers the identification
process, the memorandum pertaining to the activities of the office
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also extended a welcome to "the agreement of the
Moroccan authorities to formalize the presence of the UNHCR in the
Western Sahara, and the agreement of the Polisario Front to resume
pre-registration activities in the refugee camps."
</P>
<P>
In his report presented to the Security Council, Annan Tuesday
proposed a green light to voter registration of members of three
Western Sahara tribal groups involved in a dispute that has held
up a referendum on the future of the territory.
</P>
<P>
The referendum is to decide whether Western Sahara should be
incorporated into Morocco, which controls most of the former
Spanish colony, or become independent, as sought by the Polisario
Front, whose base camps are in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Morocco maintained that all members of those groups had a right
to be identified to determine their eligibility to vote. However,
the Polisario Front said none had that right except for those
listed in a 1974 Spanish census of the territory, and their
immediate families.
</P>
<P>
To break the deadlock, Annan said in his latest report, "I have
decided to present my own arbitration in order to move ahead on
this issue."
</P>
<P>
The referendum is likely to be held in December 1999, a year
later than the most recent target date of December 7 this year.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Govt Urged to Restrict Unplanned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government was
urged Friday to restrict the mushrooming of unplanned buildings
in the country especially in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
President of the Zambian Institute of Architects (ZIA) Dixon
Bwalya made the appeal here while opening a two-day workshop for
architects.
</P>
<P>
He said ZIA is concerned at the mushrooming of the unplanned
buildings especially in the capital city of Lusaka, which he
said has made the city look ugly.
</P>
<P>
The unplanned expansion of Lusaka coupled with other factors
such as the lack of adequate clean water, poor drainage system
and the potential fire hazards to structures has continued to
worry his institute, he said.
</P>
<P>
Bwalya accused councillors of allowing the structures to
mushroom up hazardously around the city, making it look like a
huge ghetto.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to come up with minimum qualifications
for councillors to ensure that quality people who know about town
planning can be elected.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion Minister of Local Government and Housing
Bennie Mwiinga acknowledged the problem of the unplanned
structures in the city in particular and the country as a whole,
but challenged the architects to help find a solution to the
scourge.

<HEADLINE> China: Globalization Should be Put Back on Right Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The globalization and
liberalization should be put back on the right track so that all
countries could enjoy real and equal benefit from the process,
China stressed here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 53rd session of the General Assembly, Chinese
delegate Yuan Shaofu said globalization did not mean
uniformization, and every country had the right in light of its
characteristics to choose its own way of participating in
globalization.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Shaofu said liberalization was not an end in itself but a
means to the real goal of promoting development and eliminate
poverty.
</P>
<P>
Yuan said Liberalization in any sector must take account of the
specific conditions, levels of development and sustaining capacity
of the country concerned, and liberalization in service sectors
such as finance should take into consideration the developing
countries' special difficulties, respect their policy goals and
readiness to join the process.
</P>
<P>
The delegate said the developed countries should
comprehensively and faithfully fulfill the commitments they made
in the Uruguay Round Agreements by eliminating all tariff and
non-tariff barriers so as to provide greater market access to
developing countries' competitive products.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, Nigeria, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Flames shot up into the
sky here Friday as about 2,000 kilograms of Indian hemps, heroine
and other drugs were set afire by leaders of member countries of
the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
The event, a major one at the opening session of the 2lst
ECOWAS summit held in the Nigerian capital, is an indication of
the sub-regional leaders' determination to combat the rapid
spread of drug trafficking and abuse in their countries.
</P>
<P>
The drugs, seized by authorities in ECOWAS 16 member
countries, were set on flames by leaders in front of the ECOWAS
Secretariat in Abuja.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement read at the ceremony, the leaders
expressed their deep concern over the spread of drug abuse and
trafficking in West Africa and the resultant upsurge in criminal
activities.
</P>
<P>
The leaders promised to allocate necessary resources and to
adopt legislative measures and the operational instruments needed
to protect their people from the destructive effects of drugs and
related criminal activities,
</P>
<P>
To step up the war against drugs, the leaders are expected to
approve the formal establishment of an ECOWAS drug fund during
the on-going summit, which will end Saturday.

<HEADLINE> EU Vows to Continue Fight Against Climate Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will
continue to take a leading role in making efforts to continue the
fight against climate change and to protect environment, said the
European Commission here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The commission expressed the stance as the Fourth Conference of
Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change will
begin on November 2 in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive body, said that
apart from signing the Kyoto Protocol in April 1998, the EU now is
on track to stabilize its carbon dioxide emissions by the year
2000 at the level they were in 1990, as promised at the Rio
meeting in 1992.
</P>
<P>
EU Commissioner for the environment Ritt Bjerregaard said, "The
fight to reverse emission trends in order to avoid the devastating
consequences of climate change cannot be dealt with in one go."
</P>
<P>
When emphasizing key principles in the fight against climate
change, the commissioner said industrialized countries need to
demonstrate their willingness to go first. "We create the problem
and we must be in the forefront in solving it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner also stressed the point that domestic action
must continue to be the main means of attacking the problems of
climate change and all sectors need to take a good hard look at
how they can respond to the challenge of climate change.
</P>
<P>
"Business as usual is not an option. A more efficient and
cleaner use of energy, more environmentally friendly vehicles and
a better public transport system and sustainable agriculture are
key examples of what we must address," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Without commitments from i.e. the U.S. and Russia, the
reduction achievements from Kyoto will effectively be gone with
the wind. We simply cannot allow this to happen," he said.
</P>
<P>
Among other main objectives for the EU in Buenos Aires, the
European Commission in its news release called for developing
countries' participation in the fight.
</P>
<P>
Substantial domestic efforts by industrialized countries will
be crucial in demonstrating to developing countries the
industrialized world's commitment to solving the problem of
climate change, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
The EU said it will continue to play a bridging role between
developing countries on the one hand and the industrialized world
on the other. In the long run, global participation will be
important to ensure the necessary results, the commission said.

<HEADLINE> Zambia, Angola Reaffirms Commitment to Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Zambia and Angola reaffirmed
Friday their commitment to strengthening peace efforts and
stability and their support for embattled Congolese (K) leader
Laurent Kabila, according to Zambia News Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 15th Angola-Zambia Joint Permanent Commission
on Defense and Security that opened in Lusaka, Zambian Defense
Minister Chitalu Sampa said Zambia is committed to the attainment
of peace in Angola and that the Zambian government will ensure
that the the 1994 Lusaka Peace Protocol to end the Angolan civil
war is implemented to the letter.
</P>
<P>
Zambia, he noted, has put in place tough measures to ensure
that unscrupulous arms dealers do not use the country's soil or
airspace to supply arms to the rebel movement, the National Union
for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), led by Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Among the security measures that Zambia has put in place are
increased security at airports and landing strips countrywide and
border areas, Sampa said.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, Angola accused Zambia of supplying UNITA with
arms and once threatened to invade its eastern neighbor. Lusaka
denied the accusation and allowed Luanda as well as U.N.
officials to come to the country to inspect the border areas.
</P>
<P>
The tension between the two countries did not ease until U.N.
officials said the Zambian government was innocent.
</P>
<P>
As far as the regional conflicts, Sampa said the emerging
political and armed conflicts are hampering the efforts by the
14-member Southern African Development Community (SADC) states to
attain regional development and stability.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for member states to support all the
peace efforts aimed at solving conflicts in countries such as
Congo (K), Lesotho and the possibly renewed civil war between
UNITA and the Angolan government troops.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian minister also praised Angola for sending troops to
help Kabila quell the Congolese rebellion which started on August
2, 1998.
</P>
<P>
He added that there is need for the joint commission to
continue meeting regularly to discuss common border problems to
enhance peace and stability between the two countries and the
entire region.
</P>
<P>
At the same meeting, Angolan Defense Minister General Pedro
Sebastiao urged SADC countries to treat UNITA leader Savimbi as a
war criminal for violating the Lusaka protocol.
</P>
<P>
He said Savimbi is rebuilding his army and that a number of
people and property are being devastated in the renewed fighting.
</P>
<P>
UNITA, said the Angolan minister, poses a threat not only to
Angola, adding that the movement is also creating alliances with
other rebel movements to destabilize the region.
</P>
<P>
Sebastiao urged SADC countries to unite against UNITA and
neutralize all military aggression by the organization.
</P>
<P>
He also defended the build-up of Angolan government forces in
Congo (K), saying Kabila's government is "legitimate" and branded
Rwanda and Uganda, which denied Kinshasa's allegations of backing
Congolese rebels, as aggressors.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Palestine Soon Submits Plan Against Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. said on Friday that
a Palestinian plan of action against terrorists who have attacked
Israel was on track and would be submitted to the United States
soon.
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. Presidential National Security Council advisor
Sandy Berger did not specify when the plan would be presented. It
is due by Monday, when the land-for-security agreement between
Israel and the Palestinian Authority takes effect.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians and the Israelis are discussing this and we
are working with the Palestinians," Berger told a news conference
at the National Press Club here.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is on track, and I think we will see it soon," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the State Department said the plan, which Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made a prerequisite for an
Israeli pullback on the West Bank, would be ready Friday.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a suicide bomber attempted to attack a school bus
carrying Israeli children in Palestinian-run Gaza. The terrorist
and an Israeli soldier were killed. The children were not hurt.
</P>
<P>
Hamas, the Islamic fundamentalist group, claimed
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian authorities confined Hamas founder Ahmed Yassin to
his home and cut his telephone lines. Palestinian security
officials also said that more than 100 Hamas activists had been
arrested.
</P>
<P>
Berger credited the Palestinian Authority with taking quite
vigorous action, and called on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and other Arab leaders to support the agreement signed by
Palestinians and Israelis last week.
</P>
<P>
"They have been quite legitimately unhappy over the past 18
months that the peace process has been stalled," Berger said.
</P>
<P>
"The process is now on track, in an agreement that Chairman
(Yasser) Arafat himself, I think who is the best judge of the
interests of the Palestinian people, believes is a good
agreement," he added.
</P>
<P>
"It's important that the moderate Arab countries support that.
And we have seen much stronger statements of support, for example,
from the Gulf state countries," he affirmed.

JERUSALEM -- Palestinian security forces raided the house of
spiritual leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas Sheikh Ahmed
Yassin in Gaza Thursday night searching for a Palestinian
fugitive, Israel Radio reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The telephone line in Yassin's house was also cut off, the
radio said.
</P>
<P>
Yassin was not allowed out for prayer Friday since he was under
a house arrest placed by Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
Thursday, according to local radio and TV reports.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials said Yassin was confined to house arrest
"because his recent statements were against the Palestinian
national interests."
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented move, the first the PNA has taken against
the Hamas leader since he returned to Gaza in October 1997, was
seen as part of PNA's efforts to round up Hamas activists in the
wake of a suicide bombing Thursday in Gaza.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: G7 Financial Ministers to Work to Calm Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The finance ministers from
the Group of Seven industrial nations will work on new and
concrete plans to help calm world financial markets, said U.S.
President Bill Clinton here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed to ask our finance ministers to make new and
very concrete recommendations to help contain the excessive
volatility in financial markets that can destroy hope and diminish
wealth," he told reporters after G7 finance ministers and Central
Bank governors issued joint proposals in London to deal with world
financial chaos.
</P>
<P>
The G7 plan is targeted at keeping tighter checks on
destabilizing flows of hot money and providing the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) with a new mechanism to assist crisis-stricken
countries.
</P>
<P>
"This line of credit gives us a powerful new tool that can be
used when it will do the most good, at the lowest cost, before the
trouble starts," said Clinton, who was speaking to reporters
before departing the White House for a trip to New York.
</P>
<P>
The United States had originally put forward such a
"precautionary" fund earlier this month. The U.S. Congress later
passed a bill which contains the provision of contributing some
17.9 billion dollars for the IMF. That is part of a global 90
billion dollar package to replenish IMF resources depleted by over
110 billion dollars in bailouts put together since the financial
crisis first erupted in Thailand 15 months ago.

WASHINGTON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. Newspapers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The world's leading industrial nations endorsed U.S.
President Bill Clinton's proposal to help protect vulnerable but
essentially healthy nations from the kind of currency and stock
market upheavals that have battered nations from Asia to Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
-- An 11-member panel of senior Spanish judges decided
unanimously that Spain has the legal right to bring criminal
charges against Chile's former dictator, General Augusto Pinochet,
and to seek his extradition from Britain. The judges' decision,
which is based on a large body of international humanitarian law,
contradicted a ruling by the High Court in London, which said that
Britain had no authority to arrest the general.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. economy grew at an unexpectedly strong pace in the
July-to-September period, the Commerce Department said Friday,
despite turmoil in global financial markets. The 3.3 percent
annual rate reported by the department was a full percentage point
or more higher than many analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
-- The United Nations Security Council agreed Friday on the
nature and scope of a comprehensive review of Iraq's relations
with the United Nations that the council has offered to undertake
if Baghdad complies with its orders and resumes cooperation with
U.N. weapons inspectors.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong will Play More Roles in Future: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 31 (Xinhua) --International experts
attending a seminar here have expressed their confidence that Hong
Kong has good prospect and will play more roles in future after
its return to China.
</P>
<P>
They put forth their views and ideas at the last session
Saturday morning of the three-day conference titled "Hong Kong in
China: A Year Later" after listening to papers presented by their
Hong Kong and Singapore fellows in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
The conference was held by the East Asian Institute of the
National University of Singapore and Some 60 scholars, experts and
professors from Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Thailand, Japan, China and Taiwan took part in the event designed
to review what has happened in Hong Kong since China recovered
sovereignty over it on July 1, 1997.  Reviewing scenario in Hong
Kong a year after its return to China, all the speakers lauded the
result of the implementation of the Basic Law on Hong Kong and the
successes of China's formula of "one country two systems".
</P>
<P>
Just as Dr. Ow Chin Hock, minister of state for Foreign
Affairs, pointed out at opening of the conference that "It is
heartening to see that the soul and essence of Hong Kong have not
changed or have been changed in any fundamental way."
</P>
<P>
"One country two systems is working. Hong Kong people are
running Hong Kong," he quoted what Hong Kong's Chief Secretary
Mrs. Anson Chan has said to support his view point.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Dr. Jusuf Wanandi, chairman of the Supervisory
Board of the Center for Strategic and International Studies,
Indonesia, arrived at a conclusion that "Hong Kong will continue
to play an important role in the region."
</P>
<P>
"The region, including Indonesia, should give due attention to
her during the transition and even more so in the future," he
underlined.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Stephen Leong, from the Institute of Strategic and
International Studies, Malaysia, said "Malaysians are optimistic
that the SAR (Special Administrative Region of China) would
succeed in its transition."
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia perceived an unmistakable air of confidence in Hong
Kong, " Dr. Leong said, "They felt assured that the SAR would
perform well."
</P>
<P>
Professor Umphon Phanachet, director of the Chinese Studies
Center of the Institute of Asian Studies of the Chulalongkorn
University, Thailand, said "since July 1, 1997, Hong Kong Special
Administration Region (SAR) has undergone many challenges, indeed,
many more than most people had expected."
</P>
<P>
"But the SAR Government deserves praises for its comparatively
smooth implementation of the first ever of its kind of one country
two systems model," the professor said.
</P>
<P>
"The Central People's Government in Beijing should also be
commended with its strict adherence to the spirit of the Basic
Law," he added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that "Hong Kong is positioned well regionally and
globally," Phanachet concluded "Hong Kong seems to have the
capacity and the track records to be among the first to take
advantage of the regional recovery when it inevitably comes."
</P>
<P>
In his paper analyzing Hong Kong's position on the boards of
the region and the world, Japanese professor Takeshi Hamashita
from the Institute of Oriental Culture, Tokyo University, said
"geoeconomically speaking, Hong Kong is becoming to play more
important role in intra-Asia relation and in other world."
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is being Asianized relating from southeast Asia to
northeast Asia," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He expects Hong Kong to maintain the role to intermediate
east-west relations and to strengthen intermediary ties within
Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Along with Re-Asianization of Hong Kong, Hong Kong will play
much more important intermediary roll within intra-Asian regional
relations," he added.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Gerald Chan, visiting research fellow of the East Asian
Institute of the National University of Singapore, said "both
Australia and New Zealand, together with most of other countries
in the world, recognize the attractiveness of Hong Kong's low
level of taxation and its role as a service and entrepot center
for trade with China."
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong remains crucial as a gateway and facilitator for
Sino-Australia as well as Sino-New Zealand trade, " he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Russia Vows to Curb Inflation Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian Economy Minister Andrei
Shapovalyants said Saturday that the government will endeavor to
keep the country's inflation under 30 percent next year with its
economic stabilization measures.
</P>
<P>
However, the optimistic assertion was disputed by Dmitry
Vasilyev, chairman of the Russian Federal Securities Commission.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said the government's stabilization plan, with
measures calling for major expenses, including wage and pension
hikes, payment of government bonds, will end with the printing of
more rubles,
</P>
<P>
"We need to be honest," the Interfax news agency quoted him as
saying.
</P>
<P>
To raise the minimum wage and the minimum pension to
subsistence level, a 400 percent increase was needed, Vasilyev
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Deputy Prime Minister Valentina Matviyenio, the
Russian government owes its citizens 70.5 billion rubles (4.41
billion U.S. dollars) in pensions, back wages and children's
allowances.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, most of the state debt on Treasury bills is
supposed to be repaid in rubles, Vasilyev said.
</P>
<P>
If the measure is endorsed, an additional 200 billion rubles
(12.5 billion dollars) will have to be printed.

<HEADLINE> Parti Quebecois Leads in Quebec Election Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Parti Quebecois (PQ) has
taken a narrow lead in popular support four weeks before a general
election in Canada's French-speaking province of Quebec, according
to a poll published Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that the separatist PQ overtook the
federal Liberal Party in dozens of polls since early this year.
The November 30 election is believed to have great impact on the
future of Quebec and all of Canada.
</P>
<P>
The ruling PQ promised that if elected, it will strive to
create winning conditions for another referendum on Quebec's
succession from Canada.
</P>
<P>
The poll, the first since the election was called Wednesday,
found that the PQ had the backing of 47.5 percent of decided
voters, while the Liberals were supported by 46.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Another 5.7 percent would vote for Action Democratique and 0.6
percent picked other parties, according to the poll conducted by
Groupe Leger and Leger for Le Journal de Montreal and The Globe
and Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Among francophone voters, who constitute about 80 percent of
the electorate, 55.9 percent said they would pick the PQ, 37.3
percent favored the Liberals and 6.2 percent cited Action
Democratique.
</P>
<P>
"The PQ's wide advantage among francophone voters puts it in
the best position to win a majority of seats" in the 125-seat
Quebec National Assembly, said Canada's leading paper, the Globe
and Mail.
</P>
<P>
However, there is potential for a major shift in voter support,
since 33.3 percent of the decided voters said their choice could
change between now and the election at the end of next month, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted from October 28 to 30, has a margin of
error of 3.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Decides to Suspend Relations With UNSCOM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Iraq announced on Saturday
that it has decided to suspend all its relations with the
U.N. Special Commission on disarming Iraq (UNSCOM) until the
commission has been restructured and its Chairman Richard Butler
has been removed.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency reported that the decision was made
at a joint meeting of the Revolutionary Command Council and
the ruling Baath Party, chaired by President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The joint meeting said in a statement the decision would
not be applied to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),
another U.N. agency assigned with the mission of counting for
and destroying Iraq's nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Iraq is to freeze all activities of
UNSCOM in Iraq including its monitoring mission starting from
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi move came as a surprise to most political observes
as the U.N. Security Council just indicated a day ago in a letter
to the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan that it was ready to
begin the comprehensive review as soon as the U.N. chief confirms
that the U.N. arms inspectors are receiving full cooperation from
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq on August 5 suspended cooperation with UNSCOM and IAEA,
barring them from carrying out on-the-spot inspections to new
sites. However, their monitoring activities were still allowed.
</P>
<P>
Explaining its August 5 decision, the Iraqi government accused
UNSCOM and Butler of being a tool in the hand of America and
serving American interests and trying to create pretext to prolong
the U.N. economic sanctions imposed on the country for eight years.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi government then demanded that UNSCOM be restructured, its
headquarters be moved to Vienna or Geneva to be away from American
direct influence and the office of Chairman of UNSCOM rotate among
the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council responded on September 9 by freezing its
periodic review of the sanctions regime, thereby keeping Iraq
under the U.N. sanctions indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi leadership said in the statement "events of this year
have revealed two serious facts. First is the American lies about
the Iraqi Presidential sites which put the affairs on the brink of
destructive war."
</P>
<P>
Last February, the United States and Britain alleged that
chemical and biological weapons were hidden in Iraq's presidential
sites and threatened to launch air strikes against Iraq to force
it into agreeing to open those presidential sites to U.N. arms
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Later a special group comprising senior diplomats from member
states of the U.N. Security Council and weapons inspectors working
for UNSCOM inspected those sites, but found nothing.
</P>
<P>
"When the truth (about presidential sites) had been unveiled
before the whole world, America was not punished for its lies and
no step had been adopted towards the lifting of the embargo," said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
"Second is filthy game played by UNSCOM and its chief in
coordination with the U.S. about the allegations of the VX (nerve
gas) and when the truth had appeared through neutral labs in France
and Switzerland, the UNSCOM chief has not admitted the fact, but
he went on asking Iraq for what he termed further clarifications
with the aim of procrastination and distorting facts," it said.
</P>
<P>
The statement complained that "no deterrent measures had been
taken against Butler for his lying and manipulation with facts."
</P>
<P>
A U.S. army laboratory said June that it found traces of VX on
samples of Iraq warhead fragments it analyzed.
</P>
<P>
Iraq accused the U.S. of faking the results and insisted that
French and Swiss laboratories re-test them. Butler finally agreed
to the Iraqi requirement but said he believed Iraq had weaponized
VX agent and demand Iraq account for its past chemical program.
</P>
<P>
123 samples from different areas of a warhead dump in Iraq were
then given to Swiss and French labs and American labs for a second
round of tests.
</P>
<P>
Tests of 40 samples from Switzerland proved negative as did
the second round of U.S. tests from other 43 samples.
</P>
<P>
Of the 40 samples tested in French labs, 39 proved negative.
Scientists found a "degradation product" of a nerve agent in one
sample, which could be VX, or other nerve agents called Sarin or
Soman.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the U.N. Security Council, UNSCOM said Iraq had
probably hidden information on its ability to put VX into warheads
and now had to account for its past program.

<HEADLINE> European Commission Head Visits Central Chinese Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Governor of central China's Hubei
Province Jiang Zhuping, who met Jacques Santer, the President of
the European Commission here this afternoon, said that EU member
states have put more than 700 million U.S. dollars worth of
investment in over 200 projects in the province.
</P>
<P>
He said that province's trade with Europe last year was worth
more than 400 million U.S. dollars and in the first nine months of
this year it was more than 360 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also described the fight against floods, the loss of
lives and money, and the rebuilding in Hubei, which was heavily
hit by this summer's flooding.
</P>
<P>
Santer said that the province is a developmental model of
relations between the EU and China and trade between Hubei and the
EU is a miniature version of EU-China trade.
</P>
<P>
The EU is expected to replace Japan as China's second largest
trade partner this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Santer said that the EU wants to build a comprehensive
partnership with China and that he wants to learn more about
China's economic achievements through his visit.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Conference on Moral Values Ends in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The three-day international
conference under the theme of "spiritual and moral values for a
better 21st century" concluded here Saturday with the unanimous
adoption of the Kathmandu Declaration.
</P>
<P>
The main goal of the conference attended by over 2,000
participants from 38 countries all over the world was the
betterment of society through the upliftment and fulfillment of
the individual at a time when humanity has made astounding
progress in the material field but is troubled by numerous complex
problems because of crisis of values.
</P>
<P>
The declaration noted that the methods proposed were
restoration of the intrinsic goodness of humankind and creation of
an environment of freedom from all types of exploitation --
social, religious and economic -- through the understanding and
application of spiritual principles.
</P>
<P>
Four plenary sessions as well as seminars were held during the
conference with the focus on the role of professionals including
doctors, jurists and educators.
</P>
<P>
"The speakers highlighted the ill health, lawlessness,
indiscipline and lack of purpose engendered by over-emphasis on
material values," the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
With this in mind, the Brahma Kumaris Rajyoga Center in Nepal,
the organizer of the conference, invited the participants to
commit themselves to act in accordance with the following
four-point plan, the declaration noted.
</P>
<P>
1. Reflection -- take a minimum of three minutes each day to
look within the self, identify a positive quality such as peace,
love, or a sense of service and resolve to increase it in action;
</P>
<P>
2. Connection -- maintain spiritual power by fostering an
attitude of being an instrument for a higher purpose;
</P>
<P>
3. Application -- develop spiritual and moral values by
purposefully choosing to see them at work in ourselves and in
others;
</P>
<P>
4. Service -- promote renewal of the highest human values by
sharing spiritual understanding with others and supporting those
engaged in this task.
</P>
<P>
The Brahma Kumaris Rajyoga Centre of Nepal is a
non-governmental organization working in the filed of value and
meditation education.
</P>
<P>
There are over 4,700 such centers spread over as many as 72
countries with the international headquarters based in Mount Abu,
India.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. Newspapers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The world's leading industrial nations endorsed U.S.
President Bill Clinton's proposal to help protect vulnerable but
essentially healthy nations from the kind of currency and stock
market upheavals that have battered nations from Asia to Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
-- An 11-member panel of senior Spanish judges decided
unanimously that Spain has the legal right to bring criminal
charges against Chile's former dictator, General Augusto Pinochet,
and to seek his extradition from Britain. The judges' decision,
which is based on a large body of international humanitarian law,
contradicted a ruling by the High Court in London, which said that
Britain had no authority to arrest the general.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. economy grew at an unexpectedly strong pace in the
July-to-September period, the Commerce Department said Friday,
despite turmoil in global financial markets. The 3.3 percent
annual rate reported by the department was a full percentage point
or more higher than many analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
-- The United Nations Security Council agreed Friday on the
nature and scope of a comprehensive review of Iraq's relations
with the United Nations that the council has offered to undertake
if Baghdad complies with its orders and resumes cooperation with
U.N. weapons inspectors.

<HEADLINE> Russian Government Approves Anti-Crisis Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government on
Saturday approved the main points of an economic crisis program
which would introduce more state control of the nation's finances.
</P>
<P>
"This does not mean giving up market relations. It means
regulating them," Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said after a
government meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said the plan was "a government document. It is not even a
program but a system of measures which will be modified and
supplemented in the course of work."
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, which will be finalized next Thursday, price
ceilings will be put on essential foods and medicines and more
support would be given to small and medium-size enterprises.
</P>
<P>
To alleviate social tension caused by the chronic non-payment
of pensions and salaries, Primakov ordered Finance Minister
Mikhail Zadornov to go on television on the last day of each month
to announce the amount of money allocated to pay in full current
salaries to public sector workers, the military and key
ministries' staffers.
</P>
<P>
"If this money is not received by some sector of our society in
some region after the finance minister has announced that, let
them look at higher levels to find out why the money has not
come," Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov also denied allegations that loans provided by the
International Monetary Fund ended up being stolen and moved to
foreign bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
"A portion of the money has gotten into the hands of dishonest
people. But the majority of the funds has been used properly," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He described the recent spate of allegations of government
corruption as "a pretext invented in order to prevent the IMF from
giving us tranches of the loans approved earlier."
</P>
<P>
The IMF, which was briefed on the government measures, voiced
objections regarding state regulation of the economy, Primakov
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that not all the recommendations by IMF experts would
be accepted.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said some recommendations ran counter to the recent
statement by IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus that
macroeconomic policies alone were not sufficient to keep the
situation under control.
</P>
<P>
Russia was a country which "has never kneeled and will never
kneel", he said. If Russia received financial support, "things
will be easier for us."
</P>
<P>
"But we will not stand on our knees and beg. Russia will get
on its feet anyway."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Congressional Contacts Tightens Sino-Russian Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Frequent high-level contacts
between the highest law-making bodies of China and Russia have
actively helped promote bilateral congressional ties and the
development of a Sino-Russian strategic partnership.
</P>
<P>
The latest and most important was the one made by Gennady
Seleznev, chairman of the Russian Duma, the parliament of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Seleznev paid an official visit to China between October 25 and
30 at the invitation of Li Peng, chairman of China's National
People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and Li Ruihuan, the chairman of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National
Committee, all met with Seleznev.
</P>
<P>
During these high-level meetings, the two sides agreed that
contacts between the congresses are an important part of the
Sino-Russian strategic partnership, increasing understanding,
expanding contacts and consolidating friendship.
</P>
<P>
The two sides expressed satisfaction with cooperation in
various fields in recent years, and congressional leaders also say
that they should help increase trade and regional exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed that there is big potential in
economic cooperation as the economies of China and Russia are
complementary. However, the cooperation has not yet reached the
level it should have done.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Sino-Russian trade in the first nine
months of the year amounted to 4.1 billion U.S. dollars, 2.7
percent less than a year earlier. More efforts should be made to
speed up cooperation.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the two sides stressed the two countries should
promote mutual understanding, strengthen cooperation in planned
and other projects, and develop relations between localities,
particularly trade and economic contacts at the border areas.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also pledged to encourage mutual investment for
establishing joint-venture enterprises in both countries.
</P>
<P>
It is convinced that increasing exchanges between congresses
will continue to give an impetus to bilateral cooperation in
various fields and play a positive role in the further development
of Sino-Russian relations.

<HEADLINE> Challenges And Opportunities In China's Foreign Trade (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The 84th China Export
Commodity Fair, that ended in Guangzhou yesterday, repeated its 1994
record high of 11 billion U.S. dollars in business, but Chinese
trade officials are still only cautiously optimistic about the
country's trade future.
</P>
<P>
They say the results were hard-earned and point to the negative
effects of the Asian financial crisis, especially the depreciation
of currencies in neighboring countries and its impact on China's
foreign trade. And, they say, China's foreign trade will face
difficulties for quite some time.
</P>
<P>
Things began to worsen earlier this year, leading to slower
growth of exports, at 3.9 percent in the first nine months, as
compared with 24 percent for the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The fair also had a decline in the number of orders and some
prices, as some buyers turn to Southeast Asia where exports are
cheaper. At the same time, traditional exports to Southeast Asia
decreased.
</P>
<P>
However, they say they also believe that there are favorable
conditions for foreign trade.

<P>
One advantage is that China's economy is expected to continue
to grow at an average of 7 percent for the next decade or more,
providing a basis for foreign trade development.
</P>
<P>
The stable political and economic situation in China also makes
overseas investors more confident.
</P>
<P>
The 84th export fair showed the good prospects in
newly-emerging markets, with orders from the United States and
Europe growing substantially and the Middle East and Africa
showing great potential.
</P>
<P>
It also showed the increased competitiveness of new Chinese
products and the rapid growth of overseas-funded enterprises is
believed to be another favorable factor. China has more than
145,000 joint ventures with overseas funding, whose exports and
imports for the first time have exceeded those of state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Increased government support for foreign trade enterprises,
like tax rebates, better financing, and low interest rates are
also helping foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
The Asian economies are taking a turn for the better, as could
be seen at the 84th fair where orders from the Republic of Korea
rose by 16 percent and those from Southeast Asia, 30
percent.

Commodity Fair that closed yesterday in the southern Chinese city
of Guangzhou did 11 billion U.S. dollars in business, the same as
the record high at the 76th fair in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The fair has long been considered a showcase and barometer of
China's foreign trade. It started in 1957 when New China was badly
in need of a breakthrough in the political and economic blockade
of hostile outside forces.
</P>
<P>
Today, it is the largest foreign trade venue for Chinese
goods. In its 42 years, business has gone over 10 billion
U.S. dollars four times.
</P>
<P>
According to a veteran trade official, in the old days, the
trade hall was the size of 3 football fields and only had room
enough for 12,000 displays. Today, it is the size of 28 football
fields, with 100,000 items on display.
</P>
<P>
The first fair did 17.54 million U.S. dollars worth of
business, or one 627th of the 11 billion U.S. dollars at the 84th
fair.
</P>
<P>
It took 20 years for the amount of trade to reach 3 billion
U.S. dollars from that opening 17.54 million, but it took only 11
years after that for the figure to go from 4 billion dollars to 10
billion.

<P>
At the 83rd fair, business with the United States also
surpassed that with Hong Kong and Macao. At the 84th, the four
largest customers were Europe, the U.S., Hong Kong and Macao, and
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The 84th fair was the first to have the Information Products
Hall, with high-tech and brand-name products. The Changhong Group,
a leading color television maker, did 40 million U.S. dollars in
business.
</P>
<P>
While the fair's trade kept growing, China's proportion was
shrinking, as a result of diversified trade. Twenty years ago, the
fair was where 40 percent of the country's export business was
conducted. Now the rate has fallen to 25 percent. And, the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation since 1980 has
approved 7 regional trade fairs that complement the Guangzhou
Fair.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Meets with Yemeni Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
met on Saturday with visiting Yemeni Foreign Minister Abdul Qader
Ba-Jammal in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheikh on bilateral
relations and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Ba-Jammal, also Yemen's deputy prime minister, told reporters
after the meeting that he conveyed a message to Mubarak from
Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh on bilateral cooperation and
the security in the Red Sea and other fields.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak asked him to deliver a message to Saleh, in which
Mubarak expressed appreciation for the "exceptional" ties between
Egypt and Yemen, and to the positions of Yemen and Eritrea on the
arbitration of the Hanish islands in the Red Sea, he said.
</P>
<P>
Disputes of sovereignty over the strategically-important
islands sparked an armed conflict between Yemen and Eritrea in
1995, in which Eritrea captured most of the archipelago.
</P>
<P>
But they later agreed to an arbitration over the issue. The
London-based, five-member International Arbitration Committee
ruled on October 9 that Yemen has sovereignty over most of the
Hanish islands, a decision accepted by the two parties.
</P>
<P>
Ba-Jammal said that Eritrea will hand over the Hanish to Yemen
on Sunday and Eritrean President Isayas Aferworki is expected to
visit Yemen next Wednesday to improve bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a recent peace agreement signed between the
Palestinians and Israel, the Yemeni minister said that "talk about
peace so far remains mere ink on paper." As long as peace "does
not exist on the ground," he said, it would be "premature to
comment on anything," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel signed the interim peace agreement
last week in Washington on Israeli withdrawal from a further 13
percent of the West Bank in exchange for intensified Palestinian
crackdown on Islamic extremes.
</P>
<P>
Ba-Jammal said that he will meet with Egyptian Prime Minister
Kamal El-Ganzouri and other officials to discuss issues including
the formation of a joint bank, a Yemeni company for investment in
Egypt and joint maritime transportation.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni official arrived in Cairo Friday night on a
three-day visit.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Program Launched in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Uganda AIDS Commission
(UAC) has launched a new HIV/AIDS program for the years 1997-2000
with a budgetary estimate of 36 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The program named "Country Cooperation Framework-5" seeks to
alert Ugandans about the dangers of AIDS and its implications in
relation to poverty, the New Vision daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It will be funded by the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) and will empower infected and the unprivileged people such
as widows and orphans with income generating projects.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launching ceremony in Kampala Friday, UAC
Director-General Omwony Ojwok said that the new program will
mostly address the problems concerning HIV/AIDS, gender and
environment.
</P>
<P>
This program is a follow-up of the 1992-1996 UNDP Fourth
Country Program funded at a cost of 10 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The increasing number of AIDS affected people in the whole
country deserves continued poverty eradication assistance to
improve their welfare in the long run, the UAC boss asserted.
</P>
<P>
One-tenth of Uganda's population of more than 23 million are
estimated to be HIV-positive and some 500,000 Ugandans have died
of the epidemic since the first case was reported in the country
in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Poverty has been held for being partially responsible for the
high infection rate. At present, some reports said half of the
population are living under the poverty line in the east African
country.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Criticized for Stance on Congo (K) Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has criticized
that Rwanda's refusal to acknowledge its military presence in the
war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is an obstacle to the
settlement of the crisis there.
</P>
<P>
"Rwanda's stance has created a hurdle...a cease-fire agreement
cannot be reached without first identifying all parties to the
military conflict," local press Sunday quoted Tanzanian Foreign
Minister Jakaya Kikwete as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete, who just returned from a two-day regional meeting in
Zambian capital Lusaka early this week on the DRC crisis, made
the remarks at a press conference in Dar es Salaam Friday.
</P>
<P>
At the Lusaka meeting, Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe declared
publicly that they were supporting DRC President Laurent Kabila's
government army against the rebels, while Uganda alleged that its
troops in the DRC were sent to defend its national security
interests.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda, however, flatly denied its deployment of troops in the
DRC in support of the rebels who launched a revolt on August 2
and now control a large swath of territory in the east of the
third largest African country.
</P>
<P>
The high-level meeting was attended by foreign ministers and
defense ministers from 14 African countries, as well as the
representatives from the Organization of African (OAU), the
Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) and the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba has joined in criticizing
Rwanda, although the meeting finally adopted in principle a draft
cease-fire agreement and a mechanism for implementing and
monitoring the agreement pending further consultations with all
concerned parties.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba reportedly said that Rwanda is contributing to the
escalating of wars in the DRC and is a stumbling block in the
peace process of the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kikwete said the DRC conflicts forced hundreds of
refugees to flow into the Kigoma Region in west Tanzania every
day, causing a headache to local government.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Rejects Indian Claims of Attacks at Siachin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan on Saturday rejected
Indian claims of repulsing Pakistani attacks at Siachin Glacier
and said such statements were aimed at "hiding its own terrorist
acts and vitiating the atmosphere" for the official talks due to
take place next week in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
"It is complete fabrication, nothing of this sort has
happened," Foreign Office spokesman told the weekly press
briefing.
</P>
<P>
"It is baseless," he said of the Indian Defense Ministry's
statement that India foiled two attempts by Pakistani soldiers at
the world's highest glacier to capture a military post in the
week.
</P>
<P>
About the upcoming talks between the defense secretaries of the
two countries on six issues including Siachin, Wuller Barrage and
Sir Creek, the spokesman said "India has taken untenable positions
on all these issues."
</P>
<P>
"On Sir Creek they had accepted the internationally recognized
line but are not accepting it now, their position on Siachin is a
clear violation of Simla Agreement and that on Wuller Barrage is
violative of the Indian Water Basin Accord."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman recalled that India and Pakistan signed an
agreement in 1989 but New Delhi resiled on it. "It is one of the
numerous example of India's resilience on the agreements that it
had signed but only to back out later."
</P>
<P>
He said India's recent claims were aimed at hiding its own
terrorist activities in held Kashmir, "which are on increase."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recently held Islamabad talks between the
Foreign Secretaries of the two countries on Kashmir and
security-related issues, the spokesman said, "we were naturally
disappointed over the lack of progress in these talks."
</P>
<P>
He regretted that New Delhi was unwilling to take steps in
creating a strategic stabilization regime following nuclearization
of the South Asia.

<HEADLINE> New Opportunities, Challenges Open to HK's IT Industry: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The greatest business
opportunities for the Information Technology (IT) industry lie in
the development of sophisticated Chinese Internet applications and
innovative content, as well as services related to electronic
commerce, Secretary for Information Technology and Broadcasting
K.C. Kwong, said here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the annual conference of the Hong Kong Institution
of Science, Kwong said Hong Kong possessed a competitive edge and
some distinctive comparative advantages not available to many of
its competitors.
</P>
<P>
As a bilingual city, Hong Kong can communicate with and obtain
information from most regions of the digital world where English
is the lingua franca, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong can also use Chinese to promote and develop the
application of Chinese content in the digital world, to co-operate
with other Chinese communities, and to act as the digital
intermediary between China's mainland and other parts of the
world, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Such capability is particularly important in view of the
increasing number of Internet users in Chinese-speaking
communities, and the ever-growing demand for Chinese Internet
applications and content all over the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is a cosmopolitan city which accepts different
cultures in the world and its people are quick to assimilate the
latest knowledge and technology. With a free and market-based
economy where a free flow of information is available, the local
community can freely co-operate and make association with any
other place in the world, Kwong said.
</P>
<P>
To assist local industry and business to exploit these
opportunities, the Special Administrative Region (SAR) government
should take the lead in using IT to demonstrate the potentials,
create the necessary environment to facilitate the development of
content and applications, and raise public awareness and
confidence in electronic business.
</P>
<P>
This is precisely the aim of the Electronic Service Delivery
(ESD) scheme, a plan to deliver online government services, he
noted. Through ESD, the public can transact business with
government online and, by means of Internet, interactive
telephone, TV or other electronic means of access, Kwong said.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government is working on such supporting issues as the
establishment of certification authorities to ensure security of
electronic transactions, and the introduction of a legal framework
to provide necessary backing for electronic commerce.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Releases Latest Fiscal Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) recorded a fiscal deficit of 42.6
billion HK dollars (5.5 billion U.S. dollars) for the first six
months of the current financial year, the government announced
here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Government expenditure for the six months ended on September
30, 1998 amounted to 115.2 billion HK dollars (14.8 billion U.S.
dollars) and revenue to 72.6 billion HK dollars (9.3 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The SAR government said in a press release Saturday that
"because the accounts are prepared on a cash basis and since the
bulk of the collections from profit tax and salaries tax are
normally received in the second half of the financial year, it is
not unusual, even in good years, to see a substantial deficit in
the first half of the financial year."
</P>
<P>
The fiscal reserves stood at 417.9 billion HK dollars (53.5
billion U.S. dollars) as of September 30, 1998, a decrease of 39.6
billion HK dollars (5.1 billion U.S. dollars) from the level on
March 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The net worth of the Land Fund has increased by 2.97 billion HK
dollars (380 million U.S. dollars) since April 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The SAR released the monthly summary of its financial results
as a further step toward meeting the International Monetary Fund's
Special Data Dissemination Standard. The government said it will
continue to disclose the financial figures on a monthly basis.

<HEADLINE> Science, Technology Important for HK's Future: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region said here Saturday
that science and technology are important for the future of Hong
Kong although the rewards for the investment in this field may not
be immediately apparent.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the 6th Annual Conference of the
Hong Kong Institution of Science, Tung said that the development
of science and technology as part of Hong Kong's future is
something the government really need to work at though many people
had told him that his initiative to develop science and technology
in Hong Kong will take a long time to realize.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that the government is tackling the short-term
economic difficulties as hard as it can. However, the government
should focus the whole community on the long-term future of Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive told the audience of distinguished
scientists and academics that the theme of this year's conference,
with its emphasis on the development of a sustainable economy
through science and technology, is "indeed, a most timely one."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, in his second Policy Address, Tung set out
his firm belief that innovation and technology are important
drivers of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The 21st century will be a knowledge-based world, in which
innovation and technology are essential in adding value,
increasing productivity and enhancing our overall competitiveness,
Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"Innovation and technology also plays a critical role in
enhancing our personal pursuits of excellence, advancing our
industrial development and
improving our quality of life in general," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong must strive to fully equip itself to seize new
opportunities and to compete successfully in the global market as
we enter this new era," Tung stressed.
</P>
<P>
To achieve success in this area requires a dedicated effort and
a commitment to investing in the necessary technological
infrastructure, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that high technology is not necessarily unreachable
and distant, in contrast, it is not remote from people's everyday
life at all.
Innovation and technology are not the prerogative of new
industries, Tung added.
</P>
<P>
In the same way that banking and transportation may be
revolutionized by innovation and technology, so may other
so-called traditional industries, such as textiles, garment,
plastics and metal.
</P>
<P>
These traditionally relatively low-tech industries still have
plenty of opportunities in the global marketplace if they can
increase their added value and productivity through innovation and
application of technology, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Much good work has already been undertaken by the private
sector and this is only right in a free market economy, Tung said.
But the government does recognize that it has to play the role of
a promoter and a facilitator, Tung noted.
</P>
<P>
"We recognize the need to strengthen Hong Kong's capability to
develop
concepts and innovative ideas into generic technologies for
eventual commercialization by firms," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"We also appreciate how difficult it is for our industry,
particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, to invest heavily
in research and development," he added.
</P>
<P>
The government will therefore establish an Applied Science and
Technology Research Institute to support and stimulate mid-stream
research.
</P>
<P>
It will also set up a 5 billion-Hong Kong dollar (641
million-U.S. dollar) Innovation and Technology Fund to finance
projects which will contribute to innovation and the technological
upgrading of our manufacturing and services industries.
</P>
<P>
"We have set out our IT vision to make Hong Kong a leader, not
a follower, in the information world of tomorrow," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to promote the development of an IT infrastructure
which will stimulate the creation of new products," he added.
</P>
<P>
"To demonstrate our commitment, the government will take the
lead in improving our services to the community through an on-line
Government Electronic Services Delivery Scheme," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
The scheme, which is scheduled to be launched in the year 2000,
will enable the public to access government services on a 24-hour
basis via the Internet and other means of electronic access.
</P>
<P>
"We will also continue our effort to encourage electronic
commerce so that our businesses may strengthen their overall
competitiveness," Tung continued.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to develop Hong Kong into an innovation center
of the region and are committed to a wide range of initiatives to
achieve this purpose," he said.
</P>
<P>
But government effort alone is not enough, Tung said. To
realize the vision, the government needs the support and
contribution of the community, in particular academia and the
business sector, the chief executive said.

The accused, together with three other Taiwanese organized the
killing of Wu Wen Yu and Chang Po Wen, also Taiwanese, on June 27,
1997, because of a financial disagreement.

<HEADLINE> Progress Made in Settlement of DRC Crisis: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Some progress has been
made in the efforts to find peace in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC), a senior South African official said in Cape Town
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
President Nelson Mandela's aid Parks Mankahlana said that for
now, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United
Nations have been involved in securing a peaceful resolution to
the three-month-old civil war in the DRC,
</P>
<P>
"They are making progress, but it is very slow", he said,
noting that being under discussion were such issues as a
cease-fire, a troops standstill, the withdrawal of foreign
troops, direct negotiations between the warring parties and a
multi-party transitional authority to run the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Mandela's two-day visit to Nigeria starting from
Thursday, Mankahlana said that the South African president had
briefed Nigerian leader Abdulsalam Abubakar on the DRC issue, and
exchanged views on how the situation in the country should be
handled.
</P>
<P>
However, Mankahlana said, there was no attempt to spearhead a
joint South African-Nigerian initiative to find peace in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, 80, has been trying to mediate for peaceful solution
to the DRC crisis which broke out in early August.
</P>
<P>
Since last week, he had met with Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni, Rwandan Deputy President Paul Kagame, Namibian
President Sam Nujoma and DRC rebel leader Wamba dia Wamba.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma is one of the African leaders who sent troops to the
DRC to back DRC President Laurent Kabila, while Museveni and
Kagame were accused by Kabila's government to have been
supporting the DRC rebels.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Unionists Accept Proposed CPF Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The three-day Ordinary
Delegates' Conference of Singapore's National Trades Union
Congress came to a close Saturday after issuing a statement to
accept the proposed 10 percent cut in employers' contribution to
the employees' Central Provident Fund (CPF) account.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the union delegates took the move as
part of the overall cuts in wage and non-wage costs so that
Singapore can regain competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote to the conference Thursday, Singapore Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong urged unionists to accept painful but
necessary measures, such as cuts in wages and the CPF, to save
jobs and help the country overcome the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
CPF is a comprehensive social security savings scheme that
takes care of members' retirement, health care, home-ownership and
family protection needs, and enhances their assets. Both the
employer and employee contribute to the employee's CPF account.
</P>
<P>
CPF cuts in employers' contribution is designed to reduce
business costs.
</P>
<P>
The delegates also expressed satisfaction over assurances given
by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and Minister for Manpower Lee Boon
Yang on steps that will be put in place to cushion the impact of
the CPF cuts and wage reduction.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they also welcomed Goh Chok Tong's call to
employers to show appreciation for workers' sacrifices and to
reward them when the economy recovers.
</P>
<P>
The delegates also unanimously adopted a resolution, pledging
labor's support for the government "in adopting whatever measures
necessary to counteract the effects of the sharp economic
downturn."
</P>
<P>
The delegates urged employers to come up with an affirmative
response to their move, saying "the ball is now in the employers'
court."

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Meets With Police, Military Chiefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie Saturday met with regional police chiefs and military
commanders across the country to brief them on the present
situation in the country and on efforts to make the political
agenda a success.
</P>
<P>
In his explanation to the press after the closed-door meeting,
Minister/State Secretary Akbar Tanjung said Habibie had asked the
police and military chiefs to be patient in facing mounting
demonstrations in the run-up to the planned People's Consultative
Assembly (MPR) special session scheduled for November 10.
</P>
<P>
The rallies were part of democratic process, the head of state
was quoted by Akbar as saying.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, an estimated 10,000 protesters gathered in front
of the MPR/DPR (House of Representatives) complex here, asking
Habibie to immediately hand over power to a transitional
government free of Soeharto-era officials.
</P>
<P>
Former president Soeharto resigned on May 21 amid a deepening
economic crisis, protests and an explosion of rioting in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The protesters reiterated their rejection of next month's
special session of the MPR.
</P>
<P>
Similar protests voicing the same themes took place on
Wednesday in other cities, including Bandung, Semarang and Manado.
No clashes were reported and all of the protests ended peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Akbar told reporters that the political agenda the president
had explained to the regional police and military chiefs included
the planned special session of the MPR, general elections in May
next year and MPR general session to elect new president and vice
president later next year.
</P>
<P>
The special MPR session, from November 10 to 13, is expected to
adopt a timetable for the implementation of general elections and
a general session of MPR next year.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's meeting was also attended by governors of
Indonesia's 27 provinces, Minister of Security and Defense/Armed
Forces Commander General Wiranto, Home Affairs Minister Syarwan
Hamid, Secretary General of the Security and Defense Ministry Lt.
Gen. Soeyono and Armed Forces Chief for Socio-Political Affairs
Lt. Gen. Bambang S. Yudhoyono.

<HEADLINE> India to Decide on CTBT After Talks With EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 31 (Xinhua) -- India will take a final view
of its nuclear position on negotiations with the United States
only after entering into talks with the European Union (EU) and
Russia in November, a leading Indian daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The annual talks with the EU represented by Austria, United
Kingdom and Germany will cover nuclear non-proliferation and
disarmament, bilateral, security, regional and economic issues,
according to the Pioneer.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the External Affairs Ministry said that British
Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Derek
Fatchel and Austrian Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Binita
Ferrero-Waldner are scheduled to arrive in New Delhi on November
13 and a Russian deputy atomic energy minister will visit India on
November 6.
</P>
<P>
Though the name of the German minister in the EU delegation is
yet to be confirmed, it is reportedly said to be the first
high-level German official to visit India after Chancellor Gerhard
Schroder assumed office in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
The last annual EU-India Ministerial Troika meeting was held in
Luxembourg in September 1997
</P>
<P>
As a combined body, the EU is India's largest trading partner
with 26 percent of its exports and 30 percent of its imports.
</P>
<P>
After India's nuclear tests last May, the EU had asked New
Delhi to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
There has been no breakthrough in talks between India and the
United States which began in June this year with the U.S.
insisting on India's signing of the CTBT and giving up its nuclear
development programs.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said that talks between India and the EU would
provide the necessary maneuvering space to New Delhi for its
subsequent three-day expert-level talks with Washington.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the Indian government would not take its
final position on negotiations with the U.S. on the CTBT, dual-use
technologies and the so-called "nuclear restraint regime" before
it entering into talks with the EU and Russia.

PARIS, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers on Saturday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- France on Friday opened a judicial file against former
Chilean president Augusto Pinochet for "sequestration followed by
acts of torture" in kidnaping two Frenchmen from 1973 to 1975.
</P>
<P>
-- China wishes to take advantage of the financial stability of
Europe to counterbalance the influence of the United States: this
is the message heard by European Commission President Jacques
Santer, who was on a five-day visit in China this week. China
wishes to "diversify" its foreign currency reserves -- now
dominated by the U.S. dollar -- with the European single currency
euro.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The launching on Sunday of a telecommunications network
through the satellite Iridum will allow people to make telephone
calls at any point of the world with a simple mobile phone. The
network relies on 66 satellites placed in low orbit of 800
kilometers high.
</P>
<P>
-- The Asia financial crisis, which greatly affected the
U.S. economic growth in the first half this year, had a lesser
impact in the third quarter, during which the U.S. economy enjoyed
a 3.3-percent growth, more than 2 percent higher than the figure
estimated by experts.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Posts Solid Growth in Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Agriculture has side-stepped the
regional economic crisis to post solid growth around Vietnam, the
official Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Food yields have increased by 700,000 tons over last year, with
cattle and poultry figures rising sharply, VNA quoted the General
Department of Statistics as saying.
</P>
<P>
The country now boasts three million buffalo, four million
cattle and 18 million pigs, up 0.5 percent, 2.2 percent and 2.3
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Higher food yields mean a greater supply of animal fodder at a
lower price, and livestock farmers have responded.
</P>
<P>
Information on livestock rearing techniques has allowed many
farmers to gear their efforts towards commodity markets.
</P>
<P>
In the southern provinces commodity-oriented livestock rearing
has been popular for many years, and animal herds have grown
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
This year pig herds have increased by 3.2 percent and cattle by
two percent.
</P>
<P>
Even more effort has been poured into the processing industry,
ensuring that the size and quality of livestock around the country
continues to grow, VNA said.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Program Launched in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Uganda AIDS Commission
(UAC) has launched a new HIV/AIDS program for the years 1997-2000
with a budgetary estimate of 36 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The program named "Country Cooperation Framework-5" seeks to
alert Ugandans about the dangers of AIDS and its implications in
relation to poverty, the New Vision daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It will be funded by the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) and will empower infected and the unprivileged people such
as widows and orphans with income generating projects.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launching ceremony in Kampala Friday, UAC
Director-General Omwony Ojwok said that the new program will
mostly address the problems concerning HIV/AIDS, gender and
environment.
</P>
<P>
This program is a follow-up of the 1992-1996 UNDP Fourth
Country Program funded at a cost of 10 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The increasing number of AIDS affected people in the whole
country deserves continued poverty eradication assistance to
improve their welfare in the long run, the UAC boss asserted.
</P>
<P>
One-tenth of Uganda's population of more than 23 million are
estimated to be HIV-positive and some 500,000 Ugandans have died
of the epidemic since the first case was reported in the country
in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Poverty has been held for being partially responsible for the
high infection rate. At present, some reports said half of the
population are living under the poverty line in the east African
country.

<HEADLINE> EU's Partial Removal of Sanctions on Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar lauded the gesture of the European Union (EU)
for partially lifting its sanctions imposed on Nigeria for human
rights violation and lack of democracy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the 21st summit of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Friday in capital
Abuja, Abubakar said that with the action, the EU had
demonstrated its recognition of the development since the new
administration came into office in June.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian leader pledged that the west African country
would continue on the path of reconciliation, The Guardian
newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The EU Friday decided to ease diplomatic and sporting
sanctions, but those on military cooperation, sales of arms,
ammunition and military equipment to Nigeria will remain in force
until democratic rule is restored in the most populous African
country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokesman of the United States State Department
James Rubin announced Friday that his government had set aside
the order restricting the entry of certain category of Nigerians
into the U.S.
</P>
<P>
He said that the order was no longer necessary because of the
recent development in the country since new head of state
Abubakar assumed office on June 8.
</P>
<P>
The order, issued on December 10, 1993, restricted the entry
into U.S. of persons who formulate, implement or benefit from
policies that impede Nigeria's transition program and immediate
family members of such persons.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the British Commonwealth lifted the
sanction imposed on Nigeria in 1995, but decided to keep
Nigeria's membership suspended until Abubakar fulfilled his
promise of handing over to a democratically elected civilian
regime.
</P>
<P>
The EU, British Commonwealth and United States imposed limited
sanctions on Nigeria following the killing of Ken Saro-Wiwa and
eight Ogoni activists in November, 1995.

<HEADLINE> Kiernan Wins 1998 U.N. Environment Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Ian Kiernan, founder of the
Clean Up the World Campaign, has won the 1998 United Nations
Environment Program (UNEP) Sasakawa Environment Prize, one of the
most prestigious environmental awards in the world.
</P>
<P>
The prize, worth 200,000 U.S. Dollars, will be given at the
U.N. headquarters in New York on 16 November, the Nairobi-based
UNEP announced in a statement available Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kiernan, an Australian, was honored for mobilizing millions of
people around the globe to take responsibility for their own
environment, said the UNEP.
</P>
<P>
"The Prize has been awarded to Mr. Kiernan for communicating
in the most visible way and to the world at large, the need to
protect the environment. In a sense, Ian Kiernan's success is a
fairy tale come true," said Lord Stanley Clinton-Davis, Acting
Chairman of the Selection Committee.
</P>
<P>
"Who would have thought that in the six short years since he
launched Clean Up the World that he would have captured the
imagination of so many, and single-handedly done so much to
arrest environmental degradation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kiernan's story goes back to 1987 when he embarked on a solo
journey by sailing around the world.
</P>
<P>
Appalled by the inordinate amount of garbage floating in the
world's oceans, he vowed to himself that he would do something to
change such acts of man.
</P>
<P>
His vision gave birth to a worldwide movement which today
brings together, every September, more than 40 million people
from 120 countries in a worldwide clean-up effort.
</P>
<P>
"Kiernan has clearly demonstrated that ordinary people -- men,
women and children alike -- have it in their hands to contribute
substantially to a better quality of life for themselves and
their communities," said UNEP chief Klaus Toepfer.
</P>
<P>
"Clean Up the World is a remarkable achievement in which
significant contributions have been made to the health of our
planet by communities working together - simple yet effective,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Campaign has had wide ranging results, not only in terms
of public participation, increased awareness, and the removal and
disposal of rubbish, but in helping to bring about long-term
change and improvement to waste management practices and
policies, Toepfer said.
</P>
<P>
"The results of the Campaign, in terms of direct improvement
to the living standards and behavior of participating communities
are immeasurable. It is a concrete example of how environmental
issues are best handled with the support of and by the people,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> FUNCINPEC Reaffirms its Power Sharing Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 31 (Xinhua) -- FUNCINEC said it did not
propose a co-chairmanship of the National Assembly nor would the
party agree to take such a creative but powerless position,
blaming the present deadlock on the ruling Cambodian People's
Party (CPP).
</P>
<P>
FUNCINPEC made the statement in a news release issued Saturday.
It is also the response to CPP President Chea Sim's statement
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A CPP document Wednesday said the party was willing to make
concessions to the opposition and restart negotiations. The party
did not win enough seats in July's election to form a government
alone.
</P>
<P>
But FUNCINPEC said, "CPP's concessions are no concessions ...
should the CPP want to truly resolve the present deadlock,
solutions would be found."
</P>
<P>
FUNCINPEC's news release stressed that "as the party has
learned well that co-chairing anything with the CPP means
surrendering full power to them. Furthermore, such proposal is
unconstitutional."
</P>
<P>
"FUNCINPEC proposed that the chairman, first vice-chairman and
second vice-chairman positions be offered respectively to
FUNCINPEC, CPP and Sam Rainsy Party (SRP), and the nine
commissions be chaired under the formula of four-four-one," it
insisted.
</P>
<P>
It claimed, "the CPP's offer to share four out of the nine
Parliamentarian Commissions with FUNCINPEC, leaving the SRP no
role in the commissions is unacceptable and against national
reconciliation."
</P>
<P>
FUNCINPEC said it believed that discussions on the sharing of
power should not be addressed until the three winning parties
agree on a common political agenda for the long term development
of the nation. Such agenda needs to give priority to the issues
affecting the lives of all Cambodians and the future of the
nation.
</P>
<P>
Prince Ranariddh and other party members have been in Bangkok
for more than a month, claiming it is not safe for them to return.
</P>
<P>
The three parties have held one summit and three working group
meetings but failed to make much progress.

<HEADLINE> Pak Revenue Collection 13 Billion Rupees Short of Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's revenue collection
in the first four months of the 1998-99 fiscal year starting from
July 1 was 13 billion rupees (46 rupees equal one dollar) short of
the budgetary target.
</P>
<P>
The revenue collection during the four months stood at 83
billion rupees against the target of 96 billion rupees, according
to the Central Board of Revenue.
</P>
<P>
The total revenue target for the financial year set by the
government is 354 billion rupees.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that revenue of 24 billion rupees had been
collected during the outgoing month of October against the target
of 29 billion rupees, showing a shortfall of five billion rupees.
</P>
<P>
However, official sources said that the anticipated shortfall
during the whole fiscal year is likely to be less than 18 billion
rupees against a shortfall of 30 billion rupees in the previous
fiscal year of 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
Describing the existing economic crisis facing the country as a
major factor towards expected shortfall in the revenue collection,
the sources said fall in customs duty and decline in the
collection of sales tax on import-related goods are an outcome of
declining trend in imports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, economic analysts observed that the current style of
management of balance of payment might not work and there would be
lesser amount of export earnings, further aggravating the balance
of payment position.

<HEADLINE> West Provides $46 Million for Mozambique's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The donors from the United
States and Europe have agreed to provide 46 million U.S. Dollars
as start-up capital for a agricultural program in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Carlos de Rosario, Mozambican Minister of Agriculture and
Fishery, said here Friday that the Western donors had reached an
agreement with his government on the Agricultural Program of
Public Investment in Mozambique after several days of talks.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's Noticias newspaper quoted the minister as saying
that the 202-million-U.S. Dollar program will be launched in 1999
and completed within five years.
</P>
<P>
Rosario noted that the international donors have shown their
confidence in the Mozambican government by providing funds for
the agricultural investment program.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Mozambican officials at various levels to work
hard and improve efficiency in a bid to carry out the program.
</P>
<P>
All parties concerned should build up confidence in each other
and hold constant dialogs, the minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican Vice Minister of Agriculture and Fishery Isidora
Fastudo also said that the donors have promised more funds than
expected.
</P>
<P>
"We expected that the program will need 35 million to 36
million U.S. Dollars in 1999," said Fastudo.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the Western donors made it clear that the
interests of the farmers in the poor southern African countries
should be protected by a land act.
</P>
<P>
The vice minister added that the Mozambican government is
intensifying its efforts to ensure that a land act could be
approved in the parliament before the end of November this year.

<P>
HANOI, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is taking measures to
develop agricultural produce processing industry in order to
promote farm produce export, Vietnam News Agency reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's agriculture sector has mapped out measures to
mobilize all sources of capital to develop the farm-forestry
produce processing industry.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's agriculture sector will give priority to key
industries making highly competitive products for export.
Attention will be paid to developing small-scale processing
establishments in rural areas and setting up joint-ventures in
various forms between farmers, cooperatives and processing
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is now one of the world leading exporters of rice, with
millions of tons of rice being sold abroad every year.
</P>
<P>
Rice processing is one of the most developed processing
industries in the country.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's agricultural sector plans to build more storage and
processing facilities for the export-rice zones to ensure between
4-4.5 million tons of rice for export a year.

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Xiamen Customs in east China's
Fujian Province recently introduced a new declaration system to
improve supervision over export goods.
</P>
<P>
The new system requires seagoing shipments of export cargo to
arrive at designated docks or storage yards 24 hours in advance of
declaration.
</P>
<P>
The fact that shippers can complete five clearance procedures in
the joint inspection center will raise efficiency and eliminate
loopholes in customs inspections.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen Customs is first to adopt the system. The city, one of
China's five special economic zones, has been one of the areas to
experiment with various reform measures.

<HEADLINE> African Govts Challenged to Invest in Knowledge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 31 (Xinhua) -- John Mugabe, chief of the
Nairobi-based African Center for Technology Studies (ACTS), has
urged African governments to invest in the generation and use of
knowledge and get their people trained locally.
</P>
<P>
Africa's problems could only be solved through the acquisition
of appropriate knowledge in correspondence to Africa's needs, he
was quoted by Saturday's Daily Nation newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We need to initiate and sustain African institutions to
create knowledge appropriate to Africa," he said when briefing
Kenya-based ambassadors from 12 African countries.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe also attributed the continent's troubles to
"deliberate" failure by its people to use knowledge based on
African conditions.
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate that Africans do not appreciate indigenous
institutions. Instead, they neglect or abandon them in favor of
external ones."
</P>
<P>
He said Africa spends a lot of money to train people in Europe
and America, but that the knowledge they acquired was irrelevant
to the African market needs.
</P>
<P>
Envoys from Ethiopia, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Malawi, South
Africa, Morocco, Mozambique, Algeria, Rwanda, Burundi and
Tanzania attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
ACTS is an inter-governmental policy institution with four
African countries as members.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Nairobi Stock Exchange
(NSE) 20-share index fell to a new low Friday in four and
half years, despite a continued slide in domestic interest rates,
local media reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The NSE-20 index fell 5.67 points or 0.21 percent to close at
2,733.68, its lowest point since January 14, 1994, the exchange
said.
</P>
<P>
The index was down 37.92 points or 1.37 percent in the last
week.
</P>
<P>
Some brokers said a recovery was overdue after a dramatic
slide in treasury bill rates in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Others said the stagnant Kenyan economy, poor profits
forecasts and a negative international environment might
overshadow the market for a little while longer.
</P>
<P>
"Because liquidity is so low, it won't take a great deal of
institutional money to switch from short-term debt into equities
to turn the market round," said Rick Ashley, chief of Kestrel
Capital (East Africa), one of the major dealers.
</P>
<P>
Kestrel has been recommending its clients take a closer look
at the Kenya equity market after a fall in benchmark treasury
bill yields that has brought the 91-day rate to 19.27 percent
this week from around 27 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
Ashley pointed out that dividend yields of between 12 and 15
percent on many blue chip stocks represented good value, and said
government efforts to balance its budget implied that interest
rates could stay low.
</P>
<P>
Other brokers said the market was hampered by the poor
economic environment and overseas selling of stocks.
</P>
<P>
"From foreigners, we are seeing more selling than buying
orders -- in fact we aren't seeing many buying orders," said
Amish Gupta at Shah, Munge and Partners, "They are out primarily

NSE data shows that foreigners were net sellers of Kenyan
stocks to the tune of 119.7 million Shillings (two million U.S.
Dollars) in September, for the first time since March 1996.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Down-Size Troops in Lesotho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The South African
National Defense Force (SANDF) is to withdraw 1,400 of its 3,500
combat troops from Lesotho next week, according to a SANDF
general.
</P>
<P>
SANDF chief General Siphiwe Nyanda said Friday that 600 with
lightly armed peacekeepers will be sent in, bringing the number
of South African soldiers in Lesotho to 2,700.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports Saturday quoted the general as saying that
the 600 troops will arrive Monday and the 1,400 troops will leave
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 600 new troops would work with the Lesotho police to trace
illegal weapons, while the remaining 2,100 would keep peace in
the mountains where criminals armed with illegal weapons were
reported to be operating.
</P>
<P>
The scale-down has clearly been allowed by the reduction in
tension following the agreement reached by the Lesotho government
and the opposition parties on a multi-party transitional
authority to ensure free and fair elections in no more than 18
months.
</P>
<P>
A dispute between the Lesotho government and the opposition
over the May 23 general election boiled up to a major political
crisis in September, leading to the military intervention of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
On September 22, 600 South African troops entered Lesotho to
help restore order in its capital of Maseru, followed by 200
Botswanan soldiers later that day.
</P>
<P>
The SADC forces encountered unexpectedly fierce resistance
from mutinous Lesotho soldiers, and South Africa was forced to
deploy more troops.

<HEADLINE> PNA Vows to Smash Attempts to Sabotage Interim Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) cabinet has approved the land-for-peace deal newly
signed with Israel, vowing to crack down on those attempting to
sabotage "the national achievement" by violence.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported Saturday that the accord was passed by a
large majority in a weekly cabinet meeting held Friday night in
the West Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after the meeting warned that any attempt to
destroy the "national achievement" accomplished after two years of
exhausted effort will not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
PNA Presidential Secretary-General Tayeb Abdul Rahim said the
PNA did not object to statements issued by Islamic militant group
Hamas rejecting the interim agreement, but it would confront any
attempt to derail the peace process by force.
</P>
<P>
He also said Hamas would be held responsible for a suicide car
bombing Thursday in Gaza which killed the attacker and an Israeli
soldier, and injured five people.
</P>
<P>
The PNA responded quickly and harshly to the attack. Scores of
Hamas activists, including some prominent members, have been
arrested by Palestinian security forces in the wake of the car
bombing.
</P>
<P>
And in an unprecedented move, the PNA has placed Hamas
spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin under house arrest since
Thursday. He was not allowed out for prayers Friday and reports
said Palestinian security forces have searched his house in Gaza,
confiscated documents and cut off the telephone line.
</P>
<P>
Under the interim agreement signed by Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House last week, the PNA
will take tougher measures to fight terrorism while Israel hands
over more West Bank land to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
U.S. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger was quoted by
Israel Radio as hailing the PNA measures in the past two days as a
"quite vigorous" effort against terrorism.

BEIJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital of Beijing
has moved to improve its appearance for the celebration of the
50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic in
October next year.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 buildings totaling 800,000 square meters have
been demolished since early this year. These buildings, mostly
roughly made sheds or makeshift housing, clogged the streets and
green areas and tarnished the looks of the capital.
</P>
<P>
In the Chongwen District, city inspectors closed a ten-year-old
unauthorized bird market which had occupied 1,600 square meters of
sidewalk. One street in the Haidian District, which used to be
notorious for security problems, had 3,700 square meters of space
cleared up and some vendors without licenses were forced to go.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has also decided to give a major
facelift to Tiananmen Square in the heart of Beijing by planting
more flowers and greenery on both sides of Chang'an
Boulevard.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF to Intensify Support for Children in Great </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) will intensify its support for the children in the
Great Lakes region, putting more emphasis on the war-torn
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting with Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
in Harare Friday, UNICEF's Regional Representative for East and
Southern Africa Urban Johnsson said there is now greater need for
support from the organization because the war has left many
children traumatized and suffering.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF is part of the U.N. agencies negotiating with the
rebels who control most of the eastern part of the DRC to
facilitate the delivery of food supplies to the affected areas,
the daily Herald reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Johnsson sought advice from President Mugabe on how his
organization could help the children in the Great Lakes region,
the DRC in particular.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean president emphasized the need for the UNICEF to
continuously remind the world leaders that in any war, children
are the most affected and traumatized.
</P>
<P>
There are no losers or winners in a war because wars bring
tragedy, said Mugabe.

<HEADLINE> Wellington Airport Receives More Passengers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Passenger numbers at New
Zealand's Wellington International Airport increased to 3.5
million in the year to June 30 from 3.34 million in the previous
year, the Evening Post reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper quoted the annual report of the
airport company as saying that domestic passenger numbers
increased from 2.99 million last year to 3.11 million this year.
Meanwhile, international passenger numbers rose from 354,000 to
388,000.
</P>
<P>
This compares to a 3.3 percent fall in the year to June 30 in
international passenger number at Auckland International Airport,
the biggest airport in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Denis Thom of the Wellington airport company was
quoted as saying that Wellington International Airport has strong
domestic traffic, made up of mainly business travelers and some
leisure travelers. The airport also caters for the trans-Tasman
routes and Pacific islands. Not having long-haul flights to Asia
and beyond means the company is not affected by the Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the number of international passengers is
largely due to airlines increasing their flights to Australia,
particularly in the past year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The 66 percent shareholding in Wellington International
Airport, which had been owned by the New Zealand Government, was
sold to Infratil New Zealand in August. Infratil NZ is jointly
owned by New Zealand Airports, a consortium led by Infratil;
British investment groups Alliance Life Common Fund; and Foreign
and Colonial Special Utilities Investment Trust.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 34 percent stake in the airport is still owned by
the Wellington City Council.

<HEADLINE> Business Confidence in New Zealand Slips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Business confidence in New
Zealand
has slipped again and a deteriorating world economy can take much
of the
blame, the New Zealand Press Association (NZPA) reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The NZPA quoted the latest survey by the National Bank of New
Zealand
as saying that 36 percent of firms questioned in the bank's
October
business confidence survey expect general business conditions to
improve
over the next year, with 27 percent expecting business conditions
to
worsen, a margin of nine percentage points.
</P>
<P>
But in September, that margin was 14 percentage points and just
two
months ago, the percentage of optimistic firms exceeded that of
pessimistic ones by 40 points.
</P>
<P>
National Bank's chief economist Brendan O'Donovan was quoted as

saying that businesses were weighing the effects of easier
domestic
monetary policy and a deteriorating international environment.
"International uncertainty is proving heavier," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The international environment looks shakier by the day and it
is no
exaggeration to say that it is in its most vulnerable state in 50

years," O'Donovan said.

<HEADLINE> Simplified Entry Procedures Rendered to Taiwan Business People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Public Security
has decided to allow simpler entry and exit procedures and longer
stays in Chinese mainland for Taiwan business people with large
and sound investment on the mainland, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Under new policies, Taiwan investors with big investment on the
mainland for more than five years and with good economic returns
can now have their valid Taiwan Citizen Entry and Exit Passport
for the mainland stamped for unlimited comings and goings as well
as temporary residence of up to five years.
</P>
<P>
As for how much investment can be called "big" and how much
earnings "good", the ministry said that will depend upon
comparisons with other Taiwan-founded enterprises in the same
field.
</P>
<P>
The policy is also valid for qualifying enterprises' high-level
managers. The maximum length of stay for the main technical and
managerial staff of such enterprises, their spouses and children
is three years.
</P>
<P>
The maximum stay for managers of other Taiwan-funded companies,
their spouses and children, and Taiwan people permitted by the
ministry to work in the mainland is now two years.

<HEADLINE> Rongchang Pig Becomes Internationally Renowned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Rongchang Pig from
Chongqing Municipality has been cited as one of the eight brand
name pigs of the world.
</P>
<P>
The pig is said to have been brought by immigrants from Hunan
Province in central China to Rongchang County in southwest China
400 years ago where it has been nurtured as a fine-quality variety
through the years.
</P>
<P>
After it was selected one of the three Chinese brand names in
the 1980s, the species has been further improved by means of
modern technology. Capable of being raised in both plateau and
plain areas and in various climates, it has become the most widely
raised pig in China. Except for Taiwan, all regions of china are
now raising the breed.
</P>
<P>
China raises four billion pigs a year, making it the largest
pig-raising country in the world. Rongchang County alone produces
over 1.8 million pigs a year.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Pharmaceutical Industry Thriving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The pharmaceutical industry in
Bangladesh is thriving with local companies producing about 95
percent of the required drugs in the country, according to the
latest issue of the weekend magazine Daily Star.
</P>
<P>
The industry, with a growth rate of 12 to 15 percent a year,
has become something the Bangladeshi people can be proud of, the
magazine said, adding that there are now 208 licensed drug
manufacturers in the country, with a total employment of 65,000
people.
</P>
<P>
Since 1982 when the Drug Policy was initiated, the industry has
grown by almost eight times as local companies are flourishing in
the country, it observed.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the 1980s, the pharmaceutical sector in the country
had been dominated by several multinational companies. In 1982,
the multinational companies dominated 52 percent market share, but
by 1996 it dwindled to a meager 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
The magazine also attributed the rapid growth of the sector to
such factors as quality of products, availability of more kinds of
drugs and affordable price.
</P>
<P>
The pharmaceutical industry sector can not only meet 95 percent
of local required drugs but also export its products to more than
20 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe and North America.
</P>
<P>
Although the total export earnings are still only about 250
million taka (5.15 million U.S. dollars), the possibilities are
enormous, it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The government departments concerned have been urged to make
some amendments to the existing drug policy and introduce modern
technologies to maintain the quality of products and at the same
time open the sector wider to foreign investors, it said.

Olympics.
</P>
<P>
From Cuba, the team will proceed straight to Bangkok on
December 6.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A sudden anthrax threat on
Friday to four U.S. abortion clinics resulted in the sending of
at least 33 people to hospitals, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The four clinics in three U.S. states received letters Friday
claiming to contain deadly anthrax bacillus, which led to the
evacuation of an Indianapolis clinic.
</P>
<P>
Clinics in New Albany, Louisville, Kentucky, and Knoxville,
Tennessee, also received similar letters, federal officials were
quoted as saying by the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Employees and patients at the Indianapolis Planned Parenthood
clinic were stripped and scrubbed down by emergency crews after
one of them opened a small powder-filled letter.
</P>
<P>
A postal carrier, two police officers and 28 other people were
treated in Indianapolis. Officials said it was unclear whether the
letter actually contained anthrax bacillus, a strain of bacteria
that can be used as a biological weapon.
</P>
<P>
None of those treated in Indianapolis complained of any
symptoms, but authorities took them to a hospital after they were
decontaminated in a tent put up near the clinic. They were given
antibiotics as a preventive measure.

MINSK, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Belarus is opposed to the North

Belarussian Foreign Minister Ivan Antonovich said here Friday.
</P>

<P>
If NATO moves eastward to the Belarussian border, Antonovich
said, Belarus will be in direct confrontation with NATO, which is
a threat to the country's national interests and security.
</P>
<P>
Belarus will never allow the Belarus-Poland borders to become a
new dividing line on the Europe continent, Antonovich said.
</P>
<P>
He called on NATO to shift its focus from military to political
tasks, and said his country is willing to conduct dialogue with a
reformed NATO and help prevent the occurrence of a new dividing
line in Europe.
</P>
<P>
On the Kosovo issue, Antonovich reiterated Belarus' opposition
to any NATO military strike against the Yugoslav Federation.
</P>
<P>
He said his country has repeatedly urged NATO to abandon
military plans, and believes the only way to end the Kosovo crisis
is that all parties concerned comply with relevant UN Security
Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Military strikes will lead nowhere but fuel the confrontation
in Kosovo, he said, warning that NATO's military attacks may
trigger another round of large-scale military clashes in Kosovo.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The deployment of NATO force in
Macedonia has its legal basis, Macedonian Prime Minister Branko
Crvenkovski said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to BBC on the possibility of NATO deployment to
replace the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP),
the prime minister said the UNPREDEP's mission in his country is
only temporary.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped that there could be an early solution to the
current crisis in Kosovo saying if the crisis there worsens,
Macedonia will be the first to be affected.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, US envoy to the Balkan region Richard Holbrooke said
a rapid NATO deployment will be staged once the Macedonian
government agrees.
</P>
<P>
The primary role of the NATO force in Macedonia will be to
extract members of the verification force from Kosovo in case of
trouble.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on October 19, the Macedonian government granted NATO
the right to use its airports for monitoring flight over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia used to be part of the Yugoslav federation.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Help African Countries Improve Aviation Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States announced
on Friday that it has invited eight African nations to participate
in an aviation safety program to raise their flying standards and
promote trade.
</P>
<P>
"Safe air travel and secure airports are prerequisites for
Africa's integration into the global economy for increasing trade,
attracting investment, growing a tourism industry and weaving
together a modern society," U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney
Slater told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Slater said the eight nations are Angola, Cameroon, Cape Verde,
Ivory Coast, Kenya, Mali, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The United States will send teams next year to review the
aviation needs of these countries and to work out plans for
improving their aviation infrastructure, he said.
</P>
<P>
Improved aviation, Slater said, would push the U.S. trade with
Africa, which presently accounts for only one percent of U.S.
trade.
</P>
<P>
The so-called safe skies program was established in April by
U.S. President Bill Clinton. It is one of several U.S. aviation
initiatives in Africa, aimed at increasing travel and trade
between the United States and Africa.

<HEADLINE> Albright Urges Asia Not Turn to Protectionism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Friday urged nations hit by the Asian financial
crisis not to turn to the protectionism in search for economic
recovery.
</P>
<P>
Albright made the call when delivering a speech at the 10th
annual George Marshall lecture at Hudson Bay School in the
Northwestern state of Washington.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Albright also called on international financial
institutions to help countries do more to cope with social
hardships caused by the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The institutions "must do more to help countries cope with the
social hardships created by the current crisis and develop better
strategies for preventing future ones," she said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary is on a two-day speaking tour of the West Coast
ahead of the meetings of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum in Kuala Lumpur next month. She will accompany
President Bill Clinton to the forum.
</P>
<P>
She praised the vision of expanded trade and free markets
embodied in the Marshall plan, initiated by the U.S. to assist
European countries after the World War II. The plan has helped
spread prosperity around the world, she said.
</P>
<P>
This is especially true in the American Northwest "where the
economy is an export powerhouse and the boom in trade with Asia
has provided good jobs in everything from computers to shipping to
agriculture," she noted.
</P>
<P>
However, the financial crisis that began in Southeast Asia,
spread to Russia and now threatens the Western hemisphere is
posing a challenge to these policies, she said.
</P>
<P>
"There remains a risk that leaders in some nations will panic
and turn to the false gods of protectionism or the impossible goal
of isolation in today's global economy," she said.
</P>
<P>
Praising Thailand, Brazil and South Korea for responding to the
crisis with a deeper commitment to democracy, fighting corruption
and economic reform, Albright urged countries to undertake sounder
and more transparent financial practices.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration is "determined to get the prosperity
train back on track" and that is why Clinton put forward a plan to
restore growth and contain the financial crisis, said Albright.

<HEADLINE> Six Killed in Domino Bump In First Fall Fog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Eighty-two vehicles had
domino-fashion collisions friday morning, causing six deaths on
site and a couple of others injuried at an expressway in East
China's Anhui province.
</P>
<P>
The tragic traffic accident occured in the region's first fall
heavy fog on the expressway linking Hefei and Nanjing cities,
provincial capitals of East China's Anhui and Jiangsu Provinces
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The first two trucks' bump was reported at 5:20 yesterday
morning. In about two and a half hours, 80 vehicles, the majority
of them overloaded trucks, had head-to-tail collisions on a
stretch of less than three kilometers in the direction from
Nanjing to Hefei.
</P>
<P>
No accidents occurred on the other direction of the highway.
</P>
<P>
The vehicles bumped into each other in groups. Some even landed
on the partition fence. The majority of the vehicles suffered
severe damages, with more than ten reduced to sheer scraps.
</P>
<P>
The wreckage was cleared off the road by 11:00 am before the
traffic resumed normal flow.
</P>
<P>
The injured people, the number of which is yet to be released,
are now safe after immediate medical care in hospital, said Zhang
Hui, deputy director of the Anhui Province High Grade Highway
Administration.
</P>
<P>
Zhang attributed the tragedy mainly to the heavy foggy weather,
adding that drivers tended to feel very tired and loosen their
guard after a whole night's driving.
</P>
<P>
The majority of trucks were overloaded causing braking systems
to be slow and ineffective, which also contributed to the traffic
accident, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Slovakia's new coalition
government took office Friday with Mikulas Dzurinda as Prime
Minister.
</P>
<P>
The new government, composed of a prime minister, four deputy
prime ministers and 15 ministers, was sworn in by Jozef Migas, who
was elected parliament chairman Thursday and is acting head of
state in the absence of a president.
</P>
<P>
Dzurinda, leader of the Slovak Democratic Coalition (SDK),
became prime minister after a four-party opposition coalition
garnered some 60 percent of votes in the September 25-26
parliamentary elections, ousting former Prime Minister Vladimir
Meciar and his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS).
</P>
<P>
The opposition coalition holds 93 seats in the 150-seat
single-chamber parliament while Meciar's party only holds 43
seats, way below the required number of seats for a majority in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The four coalition parties then drove a hard bargain over the
allocation of government posts, and reached agreement Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
Under the cabinet deal, Dzurinda's SDK, the largest ruling
party, has nine government posts, against six for the Party of the
Democratic Left (SDL), three for the Hungarian Coalition Party
(SMK), and two for the Party of Civic Understanding (SOP).
</P>
<P>
Dzurinda, 42, was born in an east Slovakia town, Spis. He once
worked with Slovak railway management bureau and was briefly
Minister of Transportation in 1994. He came to chair the SDK in
1997.

<HEADLINE> Two Large Brazilian State Firms to Reduce Budgets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Two Brazilian large
state-owned energy enterprises will reduce their budgets by 1.8
billion reals (1.512 billion U.S. dollars) under a government's
fiscal adjustment, a senior official said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The budget cut for Petrobras will be 980 million dollars, and
532 million dollars in Electrobras, Mines and Energy Minister
Raimundo Britto said.
</P>
<P>
The two firms budget cuts were part of a fiscal adjustment
program announced this week by the government, which expects to
save 23.5 billion dollars next year, of which 7.31 billion dollars
will come out of the official spending reduction.
</P>
<P>
The adjustment goal is to balance the country's public accounts
through primary surpluses of 2.6 percent of the Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) in 1999, 2.8 percent in 2000, and 3.0 in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 national budget that will be modified in the next week
allocated 37.328 billion dollars for Petrobras, and 8.137 billion
for Electrobras.
</P>
<P>
Britto said the budget cuts will not affect the resources
tagged for projects considered crucial in the two companies.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the Angra II nuclear plant, in the Rio de
Janeiro littoral, and the Brazil-Bolivia gas pipeline are among
the projects which will not be affected by the budget cuts, he
added.

<HEADLINE> EU Interior, Judicial Ministers Meet in Vienna </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Interior ministers and judicial
ministers of the European Union (EU) ended a two-day informal
meeting here on Friday in preparation for the EU Vienna summit
scheduled for December.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Interior Minister Karl Schloegl, who presided over the
meeting, said the discussions focused on common immigration and
asylum policies, and strengthening judicial cooperation among EU
countries.
</P>
<P>
The EU should not only be an economic and currency alliance,
but also a security alliance, said Schloegl, whose country
currently holds the six-month EU rotating presidency.
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting reached a consensus on the basic line for
security in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Anita Gradin, EU commissioner in charge of immigration and
judicial affairs, said the meeting "paved the way" for the EU
Vienna summit.
</P>
<P>
The meeting deliberated over a document prepared by Austria on
common immigration and asylum policies, but failed to reach
agreement on the issue of refugees.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also discussed judicial cooperation and
assistance in criminal cases, transnational wiretapping and a
crackdown on bribery in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
According to Schloegl, the refugee problem in the Yugoslavian
province of Kosovo was also on the agenda, but the ministers
failed to release a common statement on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Budget Allocation for Science Declines in Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian budget allocation
for science represented only 0.16 percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP) this year compared to 0.17 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Professor Ivan Matev, chairman of the Union of Bulgarian
Scientists (UBS), said Friday in his report to the seventh
congress of UBS that only 1 percent of the higher schools' budgets
is used for scientific research.
</P>
<P>
Unofficial information shows that 13 percent of the funds
invested in scientific studies have come from the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Matev said that in 1995, 57 percent of the funds for scientific
studies went for wages, 38.1 percent for operating expenses and
4.9 percent for investment and renovation of equipment.
</P>
<P>
The total number of Bulgarian scientists in various fields
reached 25,871 in 1997, including 1,428 professors, 4,056
associate professors and 10,104 doctors or doctoral candidates of
science, Matev said.
</P>
<P>
The seventh congress of the Union of Bulgarian Scientists will
discuss a draft on reform in Bulgarian science.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The World Wildlife Fund
(WWF) and the Wildlife Foundation of Argentina (WFA) on Friday
called for the saving of forests and jungles, which are in danger
because of the climate change.
</P>
<P>
The WWF and WFA experts told the press here that all the
measures to increase the energy efficiency must be taken and less
contaminating sources of energy should be used as a final solution
to the problem.
</P>
<P>
All the countries, especially the industrialized ones, must
commit themselves to take more stringent measures to reduce their
carbon dioxide emissions, they added.
</P>
<P>
The press conference was attended by Nigel Dudley, WWF
independent consultant, and WFA Director Javier Corcuera.
</P>
<P>
Dudley said that the climate change or global warming up
threatens the wellbeing of all mankind, and that the climate
change impacts are more evident every day in all the world.
</P>
<P>
He said there exist possibilities of the destroying of the
forests, because they cannot follow the rhythm of the rapid
climate change.
</P>
<P>
The WWF, the biggest organization in the world for the
conservation of nature, has 4.7 million employees who work in 96
countries in the world. The organization also has a status of
official observer in the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> Increasing Flood Control Capacity In Eastern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Most parts of the province of
Jiangxi that were hit by this summer's severe flooding have worked
out plans for improving flood controls, with government funding.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi was one of the worst-hit areas on the Yangtze River and
surrounding lakes in the summer. The central government has
already allocated 490 million yuan (59 million U.S. dollars) for
building new towns for resettling people, local sources say.
</P>
<P>
The plan is to expand Jiangxi's flood diversion area by 1,306
square kilometers and storage area by 6.8 billion cubic meters by
dismantaling protective embankments and turning reclaimed land
back into river beds and lakes.
</P>
<P>
The plan will affect 467,500 people who have been living on the
reclaimed land. The province will build 37 new townships, 150
central villages, and over 400 basic villages for them.

<HEADLINE> Murdoch Attacks Media for Man United Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Murdoch, whose News Corp owns a controlling 40 percent stake
in BSkyB, said the government's referral of the bid for an
anti-monopoly review on Thursday appeared politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
But he added he doesn't have any hard feelings towards Trade
Secretary Peter Mandelson, the man who made the decision to delay
the 623.4 million pound (about 1.05 billion U.S. dollars) bid.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not blaming Mr. Mandelson in the least," Murdoch told
reporters after BSkyB's annual shareholders' meeting. "As far as
I'm concerned that goes with the territory."
</P>
<P>
"Obviously there is an excess of caution, yes. I mean, to be
influenced by a few paranoid hacks (journalists) in Fleet Street
is ridiculous," he said, adding that he didn't believe the bid
raised any serious competition issues.
</P>
<P>
Murdoch made the remarks during a brief question-and-answer
session that touched on topics ranging from BSkyB's plans in
Europe to the planned flotation of News Corp's U.S. Fox unit.
</P>
<P>
BSkyB's bid for Manchester United, launched in September, has
triggered widely publicized protests by some fans and politicians
who fear the takeover of Britain's biggest club will give Murdoch
too much control over British soccer.
</P>
<P>
Murdoch already ranks as a favorite target for rivals who have
criticized his grip on Britain's TV and newspaper industries.
</P>
<P>
News Corp's British holdings, aside from BSkyB, include
top-selling newspapers The Sun and The Times.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the referral to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission, BSkyB will have to wait until next year to find out
whether it can buy Man United. The MMC's report is due by March
12.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether a rival bidder might emerge in the meantime,
Murdoch said, "I doubt it. I would be very surprised."

<HEADLINE> Nazi Nada Sakic to Be Extradited to Croatia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Nada Sakic, head of the
Jasenovac concentration camp feminine area, will be extradited to
Croatia to be tried there for crimes she committed during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
This was confirmed Friday here by Victor Ramos, president of
the National Institute Against Discrimination, Racism, and
Xenophobia, of Argentina. He said Sakic will leave Sunday for
Croatia.
</P>
<P>
Nada Sakic is the wife of Dinko Sakic, commander of the
Jasenovac concentration camp, who was extradited last June to
Croatia to be tried for Nazi crimes committed there during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
Both were detained in their homes in the Argentine city of
Santa Teresita, where they resided since the end of World War II
to escape the sentence dictated against them by the former
Yugoslavia government.
</P>
<P>
The Jasenovac concentration camp is near the city of the same
name, some 62.5 miles southeast of Zagreb, in a territory that now
is part of Croatia.

<HEADLINE> Case Against Pinochet Accepted in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Italian Justice Minister Oliviero
Diliberto on Friday gave Milan prosecutors the go-ahead to
investigate into the case presented by a Chilean exile against
former Chilean president Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Diliberto looked carefully into the possibility of opening
an investigation into a crime committed abroad by a foreign
citizen before making the decision.
</P>
<P>
Vecente Bergara Taquias, the Chilean exile who has been living
in Italy since 1975, requested a Milan court on Wednesday to open
a case against Pinochet on charges of murder, torture and
kidnaping.
</P>
<P>
Taquias said that his brother was one of a group of people
gunned down by the Chilean police in 1973 at a bus stop where they
were waiting for a bus.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he himself had been beaten and tortured in
Chile during the Pinochet's rule.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 82 and senator-for-life, was arrested in London on
October 16 at the request of a Spanish judge investigating the
deaths of Spanish citizens during the dictatorship of Pinochet in
Chile from 1973 to early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The British High Court ruled Wednesday that Pinochet's former
status as head of state gave him immunity from prosecution but he
could not leave Britain until prosecutors appealed the ruling to
the House of Lords, which will hear the case next week.

<HEADLINE> 96,000 Filipino Workers in Malaysia Face Deportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- About 96,000 illegal Filipino
workers in Malaysia are facing arrests and deportation for
ignoring that country's amnesty program.
</P>
<P>
The official Philippine Journal newspaper reported Saturday
that the two-month amnesty granted by the Malaysian government is
expiring Saturday, but as of Friday less than 2 percent of 96,803
illegal Filipino migrants had voluntarily availed of the amnesty
which runs from August 31 to October 31.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs
said Friday that the Malaysian government has not yet seriously
indicated that it would conduct a massive roundup and deportation
of illegal foreign workers when the deadline expires Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"But the more prudent course of action would be to anticipate
for the worst case scenario," said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the Philippine government has
allocated 85,000 U.S. dollars as seafare repatriation expense for
the illegal Filipino workers for one month only.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Oil Price Closes Week at 10.99 U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The price for the Venezuelan
crude closed the week at 10.99 U.S. dollars a barrel, 0.40 dollars
above the close of last week, the Mines and Energy Ministry said
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
This rise in the average price puts the October average at
11.14 dollars, more than the 11.10 dollar average for the year,
but far below the 15.50 dollars estimated by the government for
1998, and under the 16.32 registered in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Official spokesmen attributed the oil market weakness to the
excess supply and to the existence of enormous inventories
accumulated by the main consumers.
</P>
<P>
Oil accounts for 70 percent of Venezuelan exports and provides
more than 50 percent of the income for its national budget.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan treasury misses some 1.2 billion U.S. dollars a
year for every dollar the crude oil barrel price drops, said
official sources.

</P>
<P>
The chairman appealed to the Ministry of Education and Culture
to have a fresh look at the curricula of primary and secondary
schools and colleges and give more classes for sports.
</P>
<P>
He said volleyball is a sport which demands no huge amount of
money in buying the required equipment and there is no
justification for schools failing to carry out the training
programs for it.

<HEADLINE> Italian Foreign Minister Urges Calm on Pinochet Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini on Friday called for the keeping of patience in dealing with
the case of former Chilean president, Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
On the sidelines of a conference on international aid here,
Dini said,"We must, first of all, await the response" of the House
of Lords on the British High Court which ruled Wednesday that
Pinochet was entitled to immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
However, Pinochet, 82 and senator-for-life, could not leave
Britain until prosecutors appealed the ruling to a five-judge
tribunal in the House of Lords, which will hear the case next week.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, who had an operation for a lumbar disc hernia in
London, was detained by British police on October 16 at a request
of Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon, who investigated human rights
violations in Chile during Pinochet's rule from 1973 to early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that about 2,000 people were killed for
political reasons in Chile between 1973 and 1978 while another
1,100 disappeared and remained missing.
</P>
<P>
Dine said that his nation strongly condemned General Augusto
Pinochet's dictatorial regime in Chile.
</P>
<P>
But the case should be handled "with great calm and without
excessive emotion," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Italian foreign minister also expressed his government's
full support to the democratic government of Chile.

<HEADLINE> NATO Begins Air Verification Over Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A group of American U-2 spy planes
on Friday began reconnaissance flights over Kosovo to monitor the
withdrawal of Serbian forces from the mostly Albanian region in
line with the U.N. demands.
</P>
<P>
The jets flew at an altitude of 20 thousand feet, to avoid any
anti-aircraft fire, but were able to photograph the ground in
minute details through the electronic equipment.
</P>
<P>
The U-2 squadron, deployed at the NATO (North Atlantic Treaty
Organization) Aviano base in Italy, is composed of four pilots
backed up by over 40 technicians under the command of
Lt. Col. Bruce Jenneman.
</P>
<P>
"These boys fly once every three days because of the
particularly stressful nature of their task," Jenneman told
reporters here, adding that pilot must wear special suits similar
to the ones astronauts use because of the high altitude they are
flying.
</P>
<P>
NATO ordered the start of the surveillance mission over Kosovo
earlier Friday to complement the work of verifiers on the ground
from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE).
</P>
<P>
Under the agreements reached with NATO earlier this month, the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia agreed to the air and ground
verification of its compliance with the U.N. resolution demanding
the pull-out of Serb forces, a return of refugees and the start of
autonomy talks with the ethnic majority in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Paralyzed Gymnast Leaves U.S. Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I shall never give in," said the 17-year-old as she left the
Mount Sinai-New York University Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
"Christopher Reeve said to me that one day we would all stand
up and walk again. I believe this day will come," added Sang, who
injured her spinal cord in July and still has no feeling from her
mid-chest down.
</P>
<P>
"I feel sad that I'm paralyzed and can't take care of myself
like normal people," Sang said. "But I don't want to lose the
confidence that I'll stand up again."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Kristjan Ragnarsson, an expert on spinal cord injuries who
has worked closely with the teen-ager, said the gymnast has made
excellent progress with increased muscle strength at her
shoulders, elbows and wrists.
</P>
<P>
In a moving farewell at the hospital, Sang raised her arms and
waved good-bye with obvious difficulty. Her immediate plans are
to continue rehabilitation and learn English.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vaulting queen was a member of the Chinese
national team. She injured during the warm-up before the vaulting
competition on July 21 when she fell head first in a vaulting
jump.
</P>
<P>
Sang can write her name, feed herself and brush her teeth.
</P>
<P>
"I want to say thank you to Dr. Ragnarsson and Mount Sinai,"
Sang said. "They have given me the best therapies and medical
care. They have even trained my mother so that she is able to
take care of me at home."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ragnarsson called Sang "an inspiration for other patients
and for the staff that worked with her." He said that she had not
missed a day of her strenuous rehabilitation program and remained
highly motivated.
</P>
<P>
Sang's mother will remain with her in New York, while her
father returns home to China. The Goodwill Games Organizing
Committee has covered all the medical cost for the Chinese
gymnast. Sang has not decided when she will return to China.

The Dutch striker breathed a sigh of relief and declared on

But he had to be accompanied to the City Ground by two

GENEVA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss police arrested
members of an arms smuggling group this week and confiscated a
large amount of weapons, ammunition and cash, the local press

<P>
The Aston Villa goalkeeper expressed relief at the decision
and thanked supporters for backing his side of the story.
</P>
<P>
A three-man FA disciplinary committee found that the charge
that Bosnich had verbally abused home fans during Villa's 0-0
draw at Goodison Park on August 15 was not proven.
</P>
<P>
Letters from Everton fans claiming that Bosnich had done
nothing wrong were produced as evidence at the 75-minute hearing.
</P>
<P>
A relieved Bosnich said: "I would like to say a big thank you
to all the supporters who wrote in with support, saying exactly
what happened, and to the FA who reacted in a very fair and
impartial way."
</P>
<P>
It is not the first time Bosnich has been ordered to explain
himself in front of an FA disciplinary panel.
</P>
<P>
He was warned about his behavior in 1996 after making
nazi-style gestures at Tottenham supporters.
</P>
<P>
He later apologized to the club, who have strong Jewish links,
for the insult and said he had meant the gesture as a "Basil

<HEADLINE> WBC to Push for Inclusion of Boxing in Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This was one of the resolutions adopted at the WBC's annual
convention in Johannesburg which ended on Friday, South African
state television reported.
</P>
<P>
If accepted, boxing would be the latest official sporting code
of the Olympics. Other codes include basketball, soccer and
tennis.
</P>
<P>
The world boxing sanctioning body also approved the acceptance
of women boxing, a junior tournament for boxers under 22 and the
staging of a world cup of boxing. It also agreed that red cards
would be used to stop the fight.
</P>
<P>
WBC president Jose Sulaiman said the convention was one of the
important milestones in the history of the organization.
</P>
<P>
"We approved so many different things in this convention that
everybody says it was one of the best in history," Sulaiman said.
</P>
<P>
The convention mapped out the future of boxing in general and
the sport in Africa in particular. According to the resolutions,
more African boxers and officials will have the opportunity to
participate in the WBC's championships.
</P>
<P>
An official of the South African Boxing Board, Peter Ngantane,
said the convention improved the networking and linking which
were very important for South Africans to get fights overseas.
</P>
<P>
He said the WBC also promised to bring more of its title
fights to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The WBC also inaugurated the building of a gymnasium in
Johannesburg, which was one of two gymnasiums the organization
had pledged to South Africa. The gymnasium will be named after
Muhammad Ali, one of the greatest boxers in history.

NEW YORK, October 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks rebounded
strongly on Friday, driven by encouraging new economic data.

The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 97.07 points or 1.1
percent to close at 8592.10, retreating from a gain of nearly 175
points because of profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
The rally, following a 123 point surge in the previous session,
made the blue-chip index advancing 139 points for the week and 749
points for October, or 9.6 percent gain for the month.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported on Friday that the U.S. economy
grew 3.3 percent in the third quarter, up from 1.8 percent in the
previous quarter.
</P>

Meanwhile the group of seven major industrialized nations
Friday unveiled a package of far-reaching reforms designed to

LONDON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets extended
early gains, after Wall Street and a brief dollar rally cemented
the earlier bullish mood.
</P>
<P>
Hopes that interest rates would be cut again pushed London blue
chip shares to finish the week up by 4.2 percent. The FTSE 100
rallied 79,9 points to close trade at 5438.4, a rise of 1.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark index was also encouraged by Wall Street's
123-point overnight advance and gains in most Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
Traders said attention was focused on next weeks' crucial
domestic events, including Chancellor Gordon Brown's pre-Budget
statement next Tuesday and the Bank of England's interest rate
announcement on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Leading stocks were further underpinned by a G7 proposal to
shore up the global financial system.
</P>
<P>
Also, stronger-than-expected U.S. third quarter growth figures
helped New York stocks climb on expectations of solid profits
growth, while few expect the numbers to prevent further rate cuts
in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, share prices in Germany finish stronger in slow
trading, with the financial sector benefiting and machinery stocks
sagging. The leading Dax index closed up 121 points at 4,671.
</P>
<P>
Banks seem to have shrugged off a round of not-too-positive
earnings this week, and the sector had been forewarned and had
priced in a gloomy third quarter, traders said.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, French stocks pushed higher as investors' moods were
buoyed by a rising dollar and by gains today and yesterday on Wall
Street. The leading index, the Cac 40, closed up 40 points at

Yeltsin began a vacation at the Black Sea, and a senior aide

Yeltsin entered a rest home outside Moscow on Tuesday to

<HEADLINE> Governor's Rule Enforced, Sindh Govt Stands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif announced Friday that the Governor's Rule has been
enforced in Sindh, the provincial government stands suspended and
action against terrorists has been started.
</P>
<P>
Sharif made the announcement in a televised address to the
nation Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
According to the Governor's Rule, the Sindh Governor has been
directed to assume "all functions and powers of the province" on
behalf of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, the prime minister said that restoration of
peace and rule of law in the provincial capital of Karachi is the
main objective behind the decision.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has decided to uproot terrorism from the
country. The conspiracy to murder Hakim Said has been unearthed
and all those involved in the murder have been pointed out, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Hakim Said, former governor of Sindh and a prominent figure in
Pakistan, was killed in Karachi on October 17. The killing caused
shock among the general public.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said that he had clearly told the Muttahida Qaumi
Movement (MQM) leaders who among their ranks were involved in this
murder and asked them to hand over the culprits.
</P>
<P>
So far the culprits have not been handed over to the
government, he said, adding the government cannot leave Karachi at
the mercy of criminals and terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Governor's Rule was being enforced in Sindh and
the provincial government stands dissolved, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sharif appealed to the nation particularly people in Karachi
and Sindh to fully cooperate with the government in its drive
against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to politicians to play their due role of
providing peace and security to the people, keeping aside their
political differences.
</P>
<P>
A report by the Associated Press of Pakistan said Friday
evening that the Rabita Committee of the MQM has deplored the
enforcement of the Governor's Rule in Sindh.
</P>
<P>
The committee in a statement termed the move as
"anti-democratic".

<HEADLINE> Democrats, Republicans Spar over Anti-Clinton Commercials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Battling for votes in next
Tuesday's mid-term elections, U.S. Vice President Al Gore and
Republicans exchanged bitter accusations.
</P>
<P>
Gore accused Speaker Newt Gingrich of the House of
Representatives of trying to turn the election into a personal
vendetta against President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Gore said he was "shocked" to learn from media reports that
Gingrich had personally devised and approved a 10 million-dollar
anti-Clinton Republican television advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
"The Republican attack machine has gone into overdrive, pouring
millions and millions of special interest dollars into negative
ads that personally attack the president," Gore said in a brief
appearance in Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
Gore said, "These attacks personally devised by Speaker
Gingrich are wrong."
</P>
<P>
Shortly afterwards Republican Party chairman Jim Nicholson
called a news conference to respond to Gore's charges.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich spokeswoman Christina Martin said the ads were
accurate, "which is more than you can say for Al Gore."
</P>
<P>
"Newt Gingrich was aware but not involved in either the
scripting or the execution of these ads," she said. "In fact, Newt
Gingrich was no more a part of those ads than Al Gore was a part
of Bill Clinton's inappropriate behavior."
</P>
<P>
The November 3 vote will involve 34 senate seats, 36
governorships and all 435 seats in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Republicans, who have a big money advantage over Democrats,
launched a series of advertisements against Clinton in key
congressional districts earlier this week, arguing that Clinton
ought to be punished for lying to the American people about his
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Democrats are expected to win the biggest single prize in the
elections -- the governorship of California. Democrat Gray Davis
led Republican Dan Lungren by 53 to 39 percent in the poll of
likely voters by the Field organization.
</P>
<P>
Republicans control 32 state governorships encompassing 75
percent of the U.S. population and have held California for the
past 16 years. They could add several more states this year,
including Florida, Maryland, Georgia and Colorado. But Democrats
are hoping to compensate by capturing Minnesota, Massachusetts,
Alabama and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
The election is likely to be interpreted as a referendum on
Clinton and on a Republican-led drive to impeach him on perjury
and obstruction of justice charges arising from the Lewinsky
matter.
</P>
<P>
Polls have shown that more than two thirds of voters want the
Clinton scandal to be over and will not allow it to influence
their votes. But with turnout expected to be as low as 36 percent,
those who do care about the scandal could have a major impact on
the outcome.
</P>
<P>
Although the party holding the White House has lost an average
of 30 House seats in mid-term elections since 1930, its losses
have been much lower when the economy has been strong and the
president's job approval ratings have been high.

<HEADLINE> Berger: China's Role to Profoundly Impact Next Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. National Security
Advisor Sandy Berger said here Friday that China plays an
important role in Asia and the world, and better ties with Beijing
will serve American interests.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the role China plays "will have a
profound impact on the new century" and that President Bill
Clinton's trip to China in June "advanced important American
interests."
</P>
<P>
Clinton's China trip was in return to a visit to the U.S. last
October by President Jiang Zemin of China. Both leaders agreed at
their Washington summit to establish "constructive strategic
partnership" between the two countries for the next century. Their
Beijing meeting was designed to maintain the momentum of improving
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
"The president's trip to China in June advanced important
American interests, from seeking peace in Korea to reducing
weapons proliferation, to promoting cleaner technologies for our
environment," Berger said at a program sponsored by the National
Press Club.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States have agreed to cooperate on such
important issues like security, non-proliferation, drug
trafficking and international crimes, while still differing on
human rights, Taiwan and trade imbalance.
</P>
<P>
"Our strategy of engagement has brought results, though there
is still far to go," said Berger, who accompanied President
Clinton in his visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Despite reports on dissidents detention in China, the Asian
country "is becoming more open, not just to commerce but to ideas,
and our engagement is helping to empower the Chinese people as
they seek more freedom," the official said.
</P>
<P>
China signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights" early this month, and sponsored an international
conference on human rights in Beijing several weeks ago, pointing
to China's desire to settle the dispute with some Western
countries on the matter.
</P>
<P>
However, critics in the U.S. keep pressing the Administration
to change the course of improving relations with China, advocating
tougher policy toward China.
</P>
<P>
Berger defended the Administration's China engagement policy,
saying "a strategy of confrontation, by contrast, would likely
push China toward isolation, undermining our hopes for greater
democracy and stability in Asia."
</P>
<P>
"The policy of engagement that we have pursued over the past
three years has improved our relationship. There are still many
areas where we have serious differences with the Chinese, but we
confront those differences directly with them, face to face,"
Berger added.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the most serious difference between China
and the U.S. is on the Taiwan issue. During his visit to Shanghai
in late June, President Clinton announced "Three No's" on Taiwan
-- no support for Taiwan independence, no support for two Chinas
or one China one Taiwan, and no support for Taiwan's membership in
international organizations of sovereign states, but U.S. arms
sales to that island have never stopped.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has stepped up criticism recently of Washington for
selling more new advanced weapons to Taiwan and the study of
providing theater anti-missile defense systems to U.S. Asian
allies including Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Berger said that Washington would continue to seek better
relations with Beijing, while maintaining good informal ties with
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past 20 years we have had, generally, improving
relations with China. Our relationships with the people of Taiwan
have flourished. And this has been good for stability in the
region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Berger rejected the accusation that better relations with China
were at the expense of ties with Taiwan, asserting "these things
do not have to come at the expense of one another."
</P>
<P>
He voiced strong support for cross-straits dialogue between
mainland China and Taiwan, calling such steps "constructive."
</P>
<P>
"This is a matter, obviously, for the peoples in China and
Taiwan to resolve themselves in a peaceful fashion. So we have
encouraged all involved to be forthcoming and constructive about
that dialogue," Berger said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Launches Anti-Malaria Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
system launched a campaign here Friday to combat malaria which
kills about 1 million children every year.
</P>
<P>
In his message welcoming the campaign, U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said the fight against malaria enables the U.N. to
focus its efforts on an issue "which has caused so much suffering
in Africa and other developing regions for all too long."
</P>
<P>
Malaria causes an estimated 300 to 300 million acute cases per
year, with most deaths occurring among children in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Studies have found that poor health via disability from
diseases such as malaria reduces incomes by as much as 12 percent
in affected developing countries, according to U.N. information.
</P>
<P>
The use of simple prevention and control methods has shown
starting results, the U.N. said.
</P>
<P>
For instance, in trials conducted in Gambia, Burkina Faso,
Kenya and Ghana, the use of insecticide-treated bed nets was shown
to effectively protect sleeping children from malarial mosquitoes,
resulting in dramatic reductions in deaths.
</P>
<P>
Based on satellite mapping and climatic information, the
distribution of malaria can now be determined at the community
level and the information will benefit national and international
efforts for malaria control.
</P>
<P>
New discoveries have led to a variety of approaches to a
malaria vaccine, with many of the possibilities already undergoing
human trials.
</P>
<P>
However, scientists estimate that it will take seven to 15
years before an effective malaria vaccine is ready.

<HEADLINE> Pastrana Outlines Policies on Drugs, Civil Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President Andres
Pastrana Friday outlined an interlocking strategy for ending the
civil conflict, curbing drug traffickers and revitalizing the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana, speaking at the National Press Club, said that
illicit drugs may one day disappear from Colombia. He was winding
up his state visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
A key breakthrough is the commitment of rebel leaders to help
eradicate drug crops if steps are taken to provide small farmers
with alternatives to narcotics plants, said Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
To help pay for the peace that he expects to begin negotiating
with the guerrillas, Pastrana said 100 million U.S. dollars has
been contributed by the Inter-American Development Bank, and that
a bond issue is expected to net nearly 800 million U.S. dollars
more.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the guerrillas and the international community
do not renege on their pledges of support, "we could eradicate
drugs from Colombia."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the fight against drug traffickers, Pastrana said,
"It is part of the fabric of my life." "I have been on the front
lines of this struggle. I am determined to win it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana expects to initiate peace talks next month with the
country's two largest guerrilla groups -- the Colombian
Revolutionary Armed Forces and the National Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
As a good-will gesture designed to build trust, he has agreed
to demilitarize a large section of rebel-held territory in
south-central Colombia for 90 days.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana sees that period as a test of the guerrillas'
willingness to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
Noting that poverty is the root cause of both the guerrilla war
and drug trafficking, Pastrana suggested that under conditions of
prosperity, young Colombians won't take up arms and farmers will
be content to cultivate legal crops instead of narcotics plants.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana began his visit to the U.S. Tuesday. It was the first
state visit by a Colombian president to the U.S. since 1975.

<HEADLINE> Security Council on Approaches to Comprehensive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Friday sent a letter to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, explaining its approaches to a comprehensive review of
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, the Security Council reiterated its readiness to
consider, in the comprehensive review, Iraq's compliance with its
obligations under all relevant U.N. resolutions once Iraq resumes
its cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors and demonstrates that it
is prepared to fulfil all its obligation, including in particular
on disarmament issues.
</P>
<P>
The Council said it was ready to begin the comprehensive review
as soon as the U.N. chief confirms that the U.N. arms inspectors
are receiving full cooperation from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Council said It would begin the review by requesting
succinct reports for the Untied Nations Special Commission
(UNSCOM) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and
other relevant bodies, setting out Iraqi compliance with relevant
U.N. resolutions and identifying any tasks which still need to be
undertaken to satisfy the remaining requirements of the relevant
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
According to the letter, the Security Council would conduct the
review in two distinct phases. The first would assess Iraqi
compliance with its disarmament obligations under the relevant
resolutions, and would also include the arrangements for ongoing
monitoring and verification.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of the review, which would follow immediately
after the first, on the basis likewise of succinct reports
prepared by the relevant bodies, would deal with Iraq's compliance
with all its other obligations under the relevant Security Council
resolutions, including those relating to Kuwaiti Prisoner of War
and Kuwaiti property.
</P>
<P>
The Council said Iraq should be invited to contribute its own
account of its compliance with its obligations, in the form of
written and oral presentation, with a clear explanation of its
reasoning.
</P>
<P>
Iraq wrote to the Security Council last Friday, asking when and
how the comprehensive review would be conducted. Iraq announced
to suspend cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors on August 5 after
talks between Iraq and UNSCOM collapsed.
</P>
<P>
As a response, the Security Council decided to suspend its
regular review of U.N. sanctions against Iraq until it resumes
cooperation. It, at the same, offered to conduct a comprehensive
review of Iraq's compliance with relevant U.N. resolutions, which
was initiated by the U.N. chief.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Welcomes Reform Pledges by New Slovak Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States welcomed
on Friday the promises of the new Slovak government led by Mikulas
Dzurinda to reform and offered more economic assistance once it
fulfils them.
</P>
<P>
Slovakia's parliamentary chairman on Friday appointed a new
government led by Dzurinda to replace that of outgoing prime
minister Vladimir Meciar, who lost parliamentary elections in
September.
</P>
<P>
"We are encouraged by the new government's pledge to pursue
economic and democratic reform and Slovakia's integration into
European and transatlantic institutions," said U.S. State
Department spokesman James Foley.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Dzurinda and his government face many challenges,
particularly in the economic sphere. The United States is prepared
to offer assistance and support to Slovakia in addressing these
problems once the new government takes necessary concrete steps to
implement the reform," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to intensify our dialogue with the Slovak government
to help Slovakia take its rightful place as a full partner in the
new Europe," he said.
</P>
<P>
Foley said the United States was glad to see that the four
parties in the new coalition have agreed to what he called "a
balanced sharing of power" and have shown a willingness to
accommodate opposition parties in the parliament's leadership.
