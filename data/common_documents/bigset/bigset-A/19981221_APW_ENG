	   BEIJING (AP) _ Underscoring the government's resolve to crush
dissent, a Chinese court on Monday sentenced a prominent dissident
to 13 years in prison, accusing him of trying to subvert state
power by organizing an opposition party, his lawyer said.
	   The harsh sentence came at the end of a 3 1/2 hour trial, said
court-appointed lawyer Mo Shaoping.
	   The trial was conducted in secrecy amid extremely tight
security. Xu's wife, who was told of the trial only on late Friday,
was the only person among his family and supporters allowed to
attend.
	   Xu's conviction deprives the nascent China Democracy Party of a
potent organizer and a moderate voice. He is the most influential
dissident leader to have been tried in a three-week campaign that
has seen at least 32 members detained or questioned.

Japan's Mars probe back on track, but engineers worried about fuel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese engineers put a half-ton unmanned
spacecraft back on track to Mars on Monday after a glitch the day
before sent it off course.
	   Engineers worried, though, that they may have used too much fuel
when correcting the probe's orbit to continue the mission as
planned.
	   ``We feel relieved of the success,'' said Prof. Ichiro Nakatani
of the government-run Institute of Space and Astronautical Science.
	   ``But more fuel than expected had to be consumed,'' Nakatani
said. ``We must study the effects from it, including a possible
change in the original program,'' he said.
	   Nakatani said it was too early to tell how the mission might be
effected.
	   The Plant-B probe, renamed ``Nozomi'' or ``Hope'' after liftoff
on July 4 from southern Japan, is scheduled to reach Mars late in
1999.
	   Japan is only the third country after the United States and
Russia to attempt an interplanetary space mission.
	   On Sunday afternoon, engineers at the institute attempted to
speed the probe up using the Earth's gravity, release it from
Earth's orbit and propel it toward Mars, the institute said in a
release.
	   But the probe failed to gain enough speed in Sunday's swingby
and the spacecraft deviated from its planned orbit, the institute
said.
	   In a second swingby Monday morning, engineers successfully put
the probe on track for the 700 million-kilometer (440
million-mile), 10-month journey to Mars, Nakatani said.
	   The dlrs 80 million probe is scheduled to start beaming back
photographs and experimental data from the Red Plant in October
1999. The probe was designed to examine the Martian atmosphere to
study how it reacts to solar winds and measure the rate at which
oxygen escapes into space.
	   Japan will rely on the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's deep space tracking network to get Nozomi's
transmissions.

Singapore's key economic indicator down substantially in November
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with government statement in graf 3

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The government said Monday that Singapore's key
economic indicator _ non-oil domestic exports _ fell 6.5 percent in
November against the same month last year, presenting further
evidence that the city-state remains entrenched in its worst
economic downturn since independence.
	   The figure was lower than most analysts' expectations of a mild
November export contraction in this vulnerable economy, about two
thirds of which relies on trade.
	   ``The worsening economic conditions in the five crisis-ridden
economies (Japan, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Thailand and Korea), which
account for 42.8 percent of Singapore's trade, as well as the
lackluster global demand for certain electronic products, continued
to take its toll on Singapore's external trade,'' the Trade
Development Board said.
	   Compared with the same periods in 1997, non-oil domestic exports
grew 5 percent in August and 1.7 percent in September before
slumping 5.2 percent in October.
	   Total non-oil exports last month equaled 7.52 billion Singapore
dollars (dlrs 4.56 billion), according to the board, which added
that total trade fell in dollar terms for the eighth consecutive
month in November.
	   Singapore has entered a technical recession, and looks set to
post only marginal overall growth for 1998.
	   The government has forecast an expansion of gross domestic
product this year between 0.5 percent and 1.0 percent, but has
warned that a full-blown recession might ensue next year.

China sentences dissident to 13 years in half-day trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment, details from lawyer; edits to trim
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Underscoring the government's resolve to crush
dissent, a Chinese court on Monday sentenced a prominent dissident
to 13 years in prison, accusing him of trying to subvert state
power by organizing an opposition party, his lawyer said.
	   The harsh sentence for Xu Wenli came at the end of a 3 1/2 hour
trial, said court-appointed lawyer Mo Shaoping.
	   The trial was conducted in secrecy amid extremely tight
security. Xu's wife, who was told of the trial only late Friday,
was the only person among his family and supporters allowed to
attend.
	   During the trial, Xu refused to reply to any questions posed by
the prosecutors and judges and responded only to questions from his
own lawyer. ``Xu Wenli said he won't appeal. He said this is
political persecution,'' Mo said.
	   Xu's conviction deprives the nascent China Democracy Party of a
potent organizer and a moderate voice. He is the most influential
dissident leader to have been tried in a three-week campaign that
has seen at least 32 members detained or questioned.
	   Xu, 55, was convicted of subversion for his role in organizing
the party and thereby challenging the ruling Communist Party. His
sentence is just slightly shorter than that given to fellow
activist Wei Jingsheng, who was sentenced to 14 years in prison in
1995, also allegedly for trying to subvert the government. Wei was
released on medical parole in November 1997 on condition he go into
exile.
	   During Monday morning's trial, uniformed and plainclothes police
cordoned off the Beijing Intermediate Court in the city's western
suburbs, preventing journalists and other bystanders from
approaching within 500 meters (500 yards). Court officials
contacted by telephone declined to comment on the case.
	   Asked the reason for the tight controls, one police officer said
``state security.'' Chinese in the neighborhood were surprised by
the police presence and said they didn't know about the trial or
Xu.
	   ``Chinese people aren't allowed to know what's going on and
foreign reporters aren't allowed to go in. This is democracy,''
said a local resident, who gave only his surname, Zhang.
	   Three plainclothes police equipped with radios followed Xu's
wife, He Xintong, as she, spurning a police offer to drive her to
the court, took the subway.
	   To prevent supporters from rallying outside the court, police
detained two of Xu's colleagues Sunday and kept watch on the homes
of at least two others, friends and a Hong Kong-based rights group
reported.
	   As it was rounding up Xu's friends, China on Sunday released
into exile a prominent labor rights campaigner in what appeared to
be an attempt to blunt international criticism of the trial.
	   Liu Nianchun was taken from a prison camp outside Beijing and,
with his wife and daughter, was put on a plane to Canada and then
New York, his first taste of freedom in more than 3 1/2 years.
	   Authorities released Liu on medical parole five months before
the end of his sentence provided he go abroad, said his brother,
exiled democracy campaigner Liu Qing.
	   Over the past two years, as China tried to woo the West, Beijing
signed two key U.N. rights treaties and won praise for bringing its
spotty legal system closer to international standards. The ruling
Communist Party relaxed some controls on dissenting views among
academics.
	   Xu Wenli and other dissidents saw opportunity in the more open
atmosphere and tried to use Chinese laws to set up and register the
China Democracy Party.
	   To wipe out the opposition movement, authorities have violated
recently revised laws intended to protect the rights of criminal
suspects. They rushed Xu and fellow leader Qin Yongmin to trial
with less than four days' notice to their families, instead of the
required 10.
	   After authorities scared away prospective lawyers, Qin and a
third principal organizer, Wang Youcai, were forced to argue their
own cases in trials held last Thursday. No verdicts have been
announced.
	   The Beijing court appointed a Xu a lawyer, but his wife said it
was a formality.
	   ``He hasn't even read the whole indictment. How is he going to
represent my husband?'' He Xintong said.
	   Xu edited a dissident journal in the Democracy Wall movement 20
years ago and spent 12 years in prison, mostly in solitary
confinement. Since his parole ended last year, he played the role
of elder adviser to other dissidents.
	   He became openly involved in the China Democracy Party in
November, organizing the group's branch in Beijing and nearby
Tianjin. Shortly before his arrest, he called on party members and
exiled dissidents to convene a nationwide congress.

Prosecution witness says police forced retraction
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By R. Mageswary &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A key prosecution witness in the
Anwar Ibrahim trial testified Monday that police threatened to send
her to jail for two years if she didn't retract her claim that her
brother's wife slept with Anwar.
	   ``I was tortured mentally to force me to change my mind,'' Ummi
Hafilda Ali testified during the opening of the seventh week of
trial that has consumed the capital.
	   Anwar, ousted Sept. 2 as deputy prime minister and finance
minister, is on trial for 10 counts of sodomy, adultery and abuse
of power.
	   The government's case was prompted by accusations by Ummi, the
sister of Anwar's former secretary, and Azizan Abu Bakar, a former
driver for the politician's family.
	   Ummi wrote a letter to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in 1997
in which she alleged that her brother's wife had committed adultery
with Anwar. Police investigations concluded the charges were false
and Mahathir halted the investigations against his deputy.
	   Ummi told the court Monday that she was arrested Aug. 17, after
having written the letter to Mahathir. She and Azizan were grilled
for seven hours, Ummi testified.
	   ``I was interrogated roughly and was also threatened,'' she
said, adding that Deputy Superintendent of Police Aziz Husin told
her she would be held for two years under the Internal Security Act
if she did not write a retraction.
	   ``I agreed because I was threatened,'' she said.
	   Ummi on Monday stood by her original letter to Mahathir.
	   She wrote the letter ``to request the prime minister to save my
brother Azmin Ali from working with a person who betrayed him _ a
person with low morals called Anwar Ibrahim.''
	   Ummi said she called on the prime minister to investigate her
sex charges and asked for police protection.
	   Anwar has denied all the accusations against him, saying they
were cooked up to eliminate his challenge to Mahathir's
17-year-rule. The ousted politician, whose wife has formed a
political reform party on his behalf, claims high-level government
conspirators are out to ruin his career.

Chinese police seize 207 kilograms (94 pounds) of heroin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Authorities arrested two men and confiscated 207
kilograms (94 pounds) of heroin in one of China's largest drug
busts this year, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported Monday.
	   Police discovered 384 packages of heroin during a search of a
cargo truck in southern China's Guangxi province on Nov. 24, the
report said.
	   It was the largest haul of heroin found in Guangxi since
Communist China was founded in 1949 and the third largest drug bust
in the country this year, the report said without providing further
details.
	   Guangxi is adjacent to Yunnan province, which borders major
Southeastern Asian drug production areas and is a key drug
trafficking route.

South Korean warship fires warning shots at Japanese fishing boat

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A South Korean warship fired several warning shots
near a Japanese fishing boat on Monday in waters between Japan and
Korea, Japan's coast guard said.
	   Several shots landed about 10 meters (330 feet) from the boat of
41-year-old Eiji Yamamoto, but the Japanese fisherman was unhurt,
said Shinji Sezaki, a spokesman for Japan's coast guard.
	   The incident occurred about 10 kilometers (6 miles) east of the
place where South Korean navy ships sunk a North Korean speedboat
in a gunbattle last Friday, Sezaki said.
	   When contacted by Japan's Maritime Safety Agency, the South
Korean navy confirmed that it had fired warning shots nearby
Yamamoto's 4.9-ton vessel, Sezaki said. The reason the shots were
fired was not immediately known, he added.
	   Yamamoto told Japanese officials that the warnings shots were
fired after the South Korean boat chased him away from a point
about 90 kilometers (56 miles), southwest of Izuhara, Nagasaki
Prefecture (state).
	   In Friday's incident, South Korean navy ships and aircraft sank
the North Korean vessel, described as a low-slung, speedboat used
to drop off or pick up spies, after a six-hour chase.
	   South Korean navy vessels are now searching a suspected mother
ship, which is believed to have taken the sunken speedboat boat
toward the South Korean shore before Friday's incident.
	   Japan's coast guard warned Japanese fishing boats to be careful
in their operations in the Korean Straight between Japan's southern
main island of Kyushu and Korea.

Dollar falls against yen on impeachment; Tokyo stocks lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stock, mid-afternoon bond and currency

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen in Tokyo
trading Monday after the U.S. House of Representatives voted over
the weekend to impeach President Clinton. Japanese stocks fell.
	   The dollar bought 114.78 yen as of mid-afternoon, down 0.42 yen
from late Friday in Tokyo and below its late New York level of
115.61 yen on Friday.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 41.34 points,
or 0.29 percent, to close at 14,152.95. On Friday, the average
closed up 67.30 points, or 0.48 percent.
	   The U.S. House's move Saturday to impeach Clinton hurt
confidence in Washington's ability to demonstrate leadership,
especially as the world economy reels from crises in Asia and
Russia.
	   ``The overall dollar sentiment is bearish. There is still
caution about Clinton's impeachment,'' said Hajime Sato, assistant
general manager of the treasury department at Daiwa International
Trust bank.
	   Hours after the House vote, Clinton rejected calls for his
resignation and vowed to remain in office until he completes his
four-year term in 2000. His case has been sent to the U.S. Senate
for trial.
	   On the stock market, share prices fell following weakness in the
dollar and concerns about rising interest rates as the Japanese
government moves to issue more bonds to help pay for a record
budget deficit.
	   The Ministry of Finance decided Sunday to issue government bonds
totaling 71 trillion yen (dlrs 620 billion) next year, one-quarter
more than initially forecast.
	   Traders said that such a large issuance of government bonds
would drive long-term interest rates higher, raising borrowing
costs for Japan's already cash-strapped companies.
	   Making matters worse, the stronger yen was seen driving up the
prices of Japanese goods overseas, eroding profits at exporters,
which had been the recession-bound economy's one bright spot.
	   Trading remained thin as many investors stayed on the sidelines
ahead of a national holiday on Wednesday in Japan.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section lost 2.58 points, or 0.23 percent, to 1,099.12. The
TOPIX closed up 9.44 points, or 0.87 percent, on Friday.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.365 percent as of 2:00 p.m. from Friday's
finish of 1.320 percent, driving its price down to 103.65 yen from
104.04.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Former United Nations Secretary General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali will arrive in Laos on Dec. 22 for a four-day
visit as part of a government effort to promote the use of the
French language, the Vientiane Times reported on Monday.
	   Boutras-Ghali was elected secretary general of La Francophonie,
the 49-member organization of countries with linguistic or cultural
ties to France, at its seventh summit in Hanoi in November 1997.
	   Laos is a former French colony, and although English is the
language most young Laos have shown a desire to learn, the
government is endorsing greater use of French.
	   A French-language newspaper, Le Renevatour, recently began
publishing and there are now French-language radio and television
stations.
	   Boutros-Ghali will be a guest of Lao Prime Minister Sisavath
Keobounphanh during his visit.
	   In November, the French-speaking world launched a new effort to
curb the domination of English in the United Nations and other
international organizations.
	   The campaign is no less than a struggle for a ``new humanism'',
said Boutros-Ghali in his keynote address to a two day symposium on
``plurilingualism'' hosted by La Francophonie at the United
Nations.
	   ``To be French-speaking is to struggle, beyond the defense of
the French language, for tolerance, respect of linguistic and
cultural diversity, for the preservation of a plural civilization _
in a word, for a new humanism,'' Boutros-Ghali said.

Angola's rival factions return to a war which neither can win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ When the government's patience with the
delayed Angolan peace process finally ran out two weeks ago and it
sent the army to storm the UNITA rebel group's strongholds, it made
a costly mistake.
	   Army generals boasted that the air and ground offensive would
crush the rebels within 48 hours. Instead, the army was caught in a
lethal crossfire and retreated with heavy losses.
	   Equally damaging to the government, the attack has enabled UNITA
to portray itself as a victim of a war-minded aggressor, despite
its refusal to comply with the country's 1994 peace agreement.
	   The result could be another protracted war in a country that has
enjoyed only brief periods of peace since it began fighting
Portuguese colonial rule in 1961.
	   The mineral-rich southwest African country gained independence
in 1975. But it quickly plunged into a devastating two-decade civil
war between UNITA _ backed by the United States and South Africa _
and the Soviet- and Cuban-backed government.
	   A 1991 peace deal collapsed the following year when UNITA leader
Jonas Savimbi rejected his defeat in the country's first elections
and returned to war.
	   The United Nations brokered a new peace accord four years ago.
But that fragile deal also lies in tatters.
	   Now, as the army recovers from a series of battlefield defeats,
UNITA boasts of its military might.
	   ``They wanted a fight and they got it,'' UNITA Secretary-General
Paulo Lukamba Gato said by satellite telephone. ``They can't
destroy us. They have to deal with us because UNITA is not going
away.''
	   Analysts say the army was startled by UNITA's superior firepower
when it moved on Andulo and Bailundo, rural towns about 290
kilometers (180 miles) southeast of Luanda, where the UNITA
leadership was believed to be holed up.
	   UNITA claimed it had disarmed and demobilized its forces, under
U.N. supervision, over the past four years. That proved to be a
lie.
	   ``Over the past year UNITA has prepared very well'' for a return
to civil war, said Alex Vines, the London-based Angolan desk
officer for Human Rights Watch.
	   When the army attacked, it came up against modern tanks, assault
vehicles, missile batteries, and sophisticated long-range
artillery.
	   UNITA is estimated to have about 30,000 guerilla soldiers hidden
in the vast bushland, compared with the government's 100,000-strong
army.
	   Despite its smaller size, UNITA, a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, possesses
formidable guerrilla expertise honed during 30 years of hit-and-run
war from the bush.
	   The rebels have used their control over more than half the
country's diamond trade to amass wealth estimated by human rights
group Global Witness at dlrs 3.7 billion.
	   UNITA has purchased weapons mainly off the international black
market, according to Paul Beaver of the London defense journal
Jane's Intelligence Review.
	   ``Most of it is updated Russian equipment from eastern European
countries,'' he said.
	   The peace process had been ailing for most of this year as the
two sides, driven by personal hatred and rival claims over Angola's
oil and diamond wealth, engaged in skirmishes in remote areas.
	   Those clashes have escalated into full-scale warfare, though the
fighting has so far remained focused on UNITA's central highland
power base.
	   UNITA has skillfully kept the army busy in other areas of the
country to prevent it from sending reinforcements to the highlands.
The army has been further weakened by helping the governments of
neighboring Congo and the Republic of Congo, which are fighting
their own insurgencies. Still, the rebels are unlikely to win a
war.
	   Meanwhile, the United Nations _ which spent dlrs 1.3 billion
trying to implement the peace deal _ is caught between the two.
	   UNITA blames the United Nations for failing to restrain the
government hawks, while army chief Gen. Joao de Matos claims UNITA
built up its military force ``under the passive gaze of the United
Nations.''
	   Even so, a senior Angolan official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the government would not break off contact with the
United Nations. Angola, the official said, depends on U.N.
humanitarian operations to meet the needs of the 400,000 people who
have been displaced by the renewed fighting.

wealth

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ In a hearing broadcast on nationwide
television, Philippine senators Monday grilled the widow of
dictator Ferdinand Marcos on her published claims that her husband
virtually owned much of the Philippines, but she dodged most
questions.
	   Mrs. Marcos said her lawyers advised her to keep silent to
prevent jeopardizing her chances in hundreds of pending court cases
the government has filed to retrieve the Marcoses' alleged
illegally obtained wealth.
	   Dressed elegantly in orange and wearing pearl and gold jewelry,
Mrs. Marcos, 69, said her husband was not a thief and amassed his
fortune through gold trading. She declined to give other details.
	   The senate hearing was broadcast live by a cable television
company, allowing many Filipinos to see for the first time Mrs.
Marcos being grilled about her family's wealth.
	   The Philippine Daily Inquirer, one of the country's leading
newspapers, early this month ran a series of articles in which Mrs.
Marcos was quoted as having said her family owns much of the
Philippines.
	   ``We practically own everything in the Philippines,'' Mrs.
Marcos was quoted as saying by the Inquirer.
	   Mrs. Marcos and her lawyers reportedly are planning to sue to
try to recover at least dlrs 12.65 billion in equity in more than
100 top Philippine corporations that were allegedly entrusted by
Marcos to his associates, who now refuse to return them to Marcos'
heirs.
	   In the hearing, Mrs. Marcos said she agreed to appear in the
senate to seek the lawmakers' help in recovering her husband's
assets now in the hands of trustees, suggesting the late president
had wanted these turned over to the government for the benefit of
all Filipinos.
	   Mrs. Marcos refused to identify the corporations and assets or
the trustees used by her husband as fronts.
	   ``With the privilege she often invoked, we don't really get the
clear picture,'' said Senate President Marcelo Fernan.
	   Mrs. Marcos acknowledged providing information about her late
husband's fortune to Inquirer reporter Christine Herrera but said
she has not authorized these to be published. She added she was not
aware the reporter recorded their conversation.
	   In an initial hearing by the senators Friday, Herrera gave
copies of her taped interviews with Mrs. Marcos to the lawmakers.
	   Ms. Herrera also showed a transcript of her interview with Mrs.
Marcos in which the former first lady said that a senior member of
the President Joseph Estrada's Cabinet, Executive Secretary Ronaldo
Zamora, held shares for the Marcos family in Security Bank, which
has been sequestered by the government.
	   Zamora and Mrs. Marcos, however, both denied the claim.
	   The government has accused the Marcoses of illegally enriching
themselves during his 20-year rule.
	   But Mrs. Marcos claims her husband was already a wealthy lawyer
even before he was elected president in 1965 by having traded gold
and secretly helped raise money for the Philippine government.
	   The government has put claims on Marcos' wealth, including about
dlrs 570 million in Swiss deposits now held in an escrow account in
a Philippine bank.
	   The Swiss accounts are also being claimed by 9,539 Filipinos who
won a class action suit for human rights violations against the
Marcos estate and were awarded dlrs 2 billion in damages.
	   Marcos was ousted in a popular revolt in 1986 and died in exile
in Hawaii three years later. He had denied any wrongdoing.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A club for American expatriates in Singapore
was evacuated and the U.S. Embassy was searched on Monday after an
anonymous bomb threat, an embassy spokesman said. No bombs were
found in either location.
	   The embassy received a non-specific threat against Americans by
phone around noon, said the embassy spokesman. Singapore
authorities were notified immediately and a search of the embassy
was conducted, the spokesman said. No bombs were found and the
embassy was declared safe at 1:15 p.m., he said.
	   Security personnel at the American Club, a private facility for
U.S. citizens that is also open to Singaporeans, said the club was
evacuated and closed. Police conducted a search but found no bomb,
they added.
	   It was not known whether the bomb threat was connected with the
recent U.S. military strikes against Iraq.
	   U.S. Embassies around the world have heightened their security
since the bombing started last week.

Zimbabwe clinch series, third Test abandoned
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Zimbabwe clinched its first ever
series outside home turf Monday after its third and final cricket
Test against Pakistan was abandoned without a ball being bowled at
Faisalabad.
	   Dense fog and bad light prevented play on all the five days
which gave Zimbabweans 1-0 series victory. It beat Pakistan by
seven wickets in the first Test at Peshawar while fog and poor
visibility stopped play for 13 hours in the drawn second Test at
Lahore.
	   Umpires Dough Cowie and Salim Badar abandoned the match on the
fifth morning Monday under dense fog and poor visibility at the
Iqbal Stadium.
	   ``The team spirit was very good throughout the tour and the
moment we saw grass on the wicket in the first Test at Peshawar we
thought we had more chance than Pakistan to win,'' said Zimbabwean
captain Alistair Campbell.
	   ``People must be busy in celebrating Christmas back at home and
this is an ideal gift from us to them,'' Campbell said.
	   Coach David Hoghton called for more recognition from the world's
ruling body, the International Cricket Council, and said: ``With
series victory against Pakistan I hope we will now get more Test
matches against teams like South Africa, Australia and West
Indies,'' he said.
	   It was for the third time when a Test match involving Pakistan
was abandoned without a ball being bowled. Pakistan's 1993-94 Test
against Sri Lanka was abandoned because of curfew in Colombo, while
in 1988-89 a Test against New Zealand at Dunedin was washed out due
to rain.
	   Paceman Henry Olonga, who took six wickets in his team's first
Test victory, was adjudged Man of the Series for visitors. He
finished the series with nine wickets at a cost of 152 runs at an
average of 16.88 wicket apiece.
	   ``Before the series I was struggling for fitness but I am quite
happy that I struck form as early as in the first Test here,''
Olonga said.
	   For Pakistan, 24-year-old middle-order batsman Yousaf Youhanna
got the Man of the Series prize after scoring 209 runs in three
innings with an impressive average of 104.5 runs. This included his
maiden Test century (120 not out) at Lahore and a fine 75 in the
first innings at Peshawar.
	   Pakistani captain Moin Khan blamed unfavorable weather for his
team's loss in the series.
	   ``We could have won the second Test at Lahore and squared the
series. But poor weather destroyed our plans and we lost the
series,'' he said.

Pacific airline bucks regional trend, prepares for growth in 1999
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT KEITH-REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ In contrast to other air carries based in the
Pacific region which have been hard-hit by the Asian financial
crisis, Fiji's national airline Air Pacific plans to increase its
carrying capacity by 70 percent in 1999, the airline said Monday.
	   Chief executive Michael McQuay told a Fiji tourism industry
meeting that Air Pacific had signed a codesharing agreement with
American Airlines and would enter a strategic alliance with a major
Asian carrier in the first quarter of 1999.
	   The airline plans to boost the number of flights to existing
destinations in North America and Australia and add new
destinations.
	   ``We have a tremendous increase in capacity,'' McQuay said.
	   McQuay, a vice-president of Hawaiian Airlines until being
recruited to reorganize Air Pacific, said that in 1999 capacity
would be increased by 70 percent, to nine flights weekly from Fiji
to Sydney, daily to Brisbane and four times weekly to Melbourne.
	   Regular service also was planned for two other Australian
cities.
	   From June 1999, a route connecting Fiji to Los Angeles nonstop
will be flown four or five times a week. Service to two other North
American destinations were planned as well.
	   A twice-weekly service to Tokyo now operated by a Boeing 767
jetliner will be switched to a larger Boeing 747, and an
application will be made for permission to run a third service to
Japan.
	   McQuay said the codesharing agreement with American Airlines
gives Air Pacific access to the interior of the United States and
its flights also would connect with the U.S. carrier's flights to
Europe.
	   Despite suffering a Fiji dollar 10 million (U.S. dlr 5 million)
loss on its Japan service this year, the airline did not expect
that business would continue to slide.
	   Pacific expected a 7-9 percent recovery in Japanese traffic,
McQuay said.
	   Two new Boeing 737-300s to be delivered in 1999 will enable the
airline to operate to new Pacific destinations now served only by
wide-bodied jets.
	   He said the airline had negotiated U.S. dollars 125 million in
finance for the two B737-300s and a B737-7000 at ``incredibly
favorable'' low interest rates for the next 12 years.
	   He said work agreements Air Pacific had negotiated recently had
lifted pilot productivity by 40 percent and cabin crew productivity
by 23 percent.
	   Air Pacific is 51 percent government-owned. In May, Australia's
Qantas Airways lifted its stake to 46 percent by purchasing
government shares.
	   The government plans to float part of its remaining shareholding
on the Suva stock exchange.

Singapore's key economic indicator falls sharply in November

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore said Monday that its key economic
indicator, which charts non-oil exports, fell a
greater-than-expected 6.5 percent in November compared to a year
ago, signaling the city-state remains entrenched in its worst
economic downturn in decades.
	   ``The worsening economic conditions in the five crisis-ridden
economies (Japan, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Thailand and Korea), which
account for 42.8 percent of Singapore's trade, as well as the
lackluster global demand for certain electronic products, continued
to take its toll,'' the Southeast Asian island republic's Trade
Development Board said in a statement.
	   Exports of electronics, which drive Singapore's manufacturing
sector and typically account for about 70 percent of non-oil
domestic exports, fell 7.6 percent on the year in November due to
global over-capacity and price weakness, the trade board said.
	   ``The November number is a real shocker,'' Song Seng Wun,
regional economist at GK Goh Holdings, told Dow Jones Newswires.
``It's really terrible. We had expected the electronics industry to
stabilize, but instead we saw a decline.''
	   The poor showing in November came after non-oil exports had
grown 5 percent in August and 1.7 percent in September before
slumping 5.2 percent in October.
	   Total non-oil exports last month equaled 7.52 billion Singapore
dollars (dlrs 4.56 billion), according to the board, which added
that total trade fell in dollar terms for the eighth consecutive
month in November.
	   The government has officially forecast an expansion of gross
domestic product this year between 0.5 percent and 1.0 percent, but
has warned that a full-blown recession might ensue next year.

Thai opposition leader says he will launch no-confidence debate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's chief opposition leader in
Parliament charged on Monday that Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai's
government is the most corrupt in Thai history and said he plans to
prove it during a no-confidence debate next month.
	   Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, leader of the opposition New Aspiration
Party, told a crowd of 10,000 supporters in the poor northeast
province of Roi Et that he has obtained a report detailing 32
corruption cases implicating Prime Minister Chuan's 13-month old
coalition government.
	   He did not say who compiled the report or how it was obtained.
	   Chavalit's party has already filed an impeachment motion against
Chuan, but it was widely expected to fail.
	   New Aspiration Party leaders were quoted in Monday's Bangkok
Post as saying they hoped to launch a no-confidence debate against
the government in Parliament by January 10.
	   Chavalit was Chuan's predecessor as prime minister. He chose to
resign in November 1997 after white collar workers took to the
streets of Bangkok demanding he quit and military leaders refused
his request to declare martial law as a means of putting down the
protests.
	   The urban middle class had become increasingly incensed over his
inept handling of Thailand's economic crisis and a seemingly
relentless series of corruption scandals involving his government.
	   Chuan's term has also been dogged by graft and kickback scandals
but most have involved bureaucrats instead of Cabinet-level
officials.
	   In a nationwide poll conducted by the Suan Dusit Rajabhat
Institute at the end of November, Chuan was named as the most
popular politician in the country with honesty and integrity named
as his most admired qualities.
	   In the poll, Chuan even beat out Chavalit in the opposition
leader's northeastern strongholds by a rating of 32 percent to 16
percent.
	   No margin of error was given for the poll.

Indian, Russian ties ``solid,'' Primakov says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Ties with military and nuclear customer
India are strong, the prime minister of cash-strapped Russia said
Monday at the official start of his New Delhi visit.
	   The partnership is ``solid, it is based on mutual interests, on
our common desire to live in a stable world,'' Yevgeny Primakov
told reporters, according to a translation of his comments by Tass.
He added that along with China, the two nations could form a
powerful strategic triangle.
	   ``India is a great power, and many things in the region and in
the world in general depend on the policy pursued by India, China
and Russia,'' he said.
	   He also reiterated Russian criticism of the U.S.-British bombing
of Iraq, an opposition India strongly shares.
	   ``Russia's attitude to the use of force in international
relations bypassing the U.N. Security Council is very much
negative,'' he said.
	   Primakov, who flew in Sunday, was welcomed with an honor guard
at the presidential palace Monday morning ahead of a full day of
meetings with Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and
others.
	   Primakov's entourage included his finance minister Andrei
Shapovalyants, trade minister Georgy Gabuniya and justice minister
Pavel Krasheninnikov.
	   Later Monday, he was scheduled to sign seven agreements,
including one on extending current military and technical
cooperation through 2010.
	   India is a leading buyer of Russian arms and its defense forces
depend up to 80 percent on Russian equipment and spares. India also
is building two nuclear reactors purchased from Russia in a dlrs
2.6 billion contract. Both sides say the reactors are for energy
purposes and cannot be used for military means _ progress on the
agreement came even after India's nuclear weapons tests in May
angered Russia and other countries.
	   The sales represent a valuable source of hard currency and jobs
for the financially struggling country. India signed a contract
last week to buy 10 Sukhoi-30MKI fighter jets from Russia. The
value of the contract was not disclosed, but an earlier deal for 10
Sukhoi-30MKIs was reportedly worth about dlrs 350 million.
	   India and Russia also will sign an extradition treaty and an
agreement covering legal assistance in criminal matters to deal
with terrorism, Indian officials say.
	   The economic agreements will seek to enhance cooperation in
steel, power and telecommunication sectors. The two countries also
will study the possibility of jointly undertaking oil exploration
in the two countries and in Central Asian republics.
	   In September, Russia delivered the first of seven contracted
cryogenic engines to India.The engines are crucial to the
development of the geo-synchronous satellite launch vehicle that
would carry a 2,500 kilogram communication satellite.
	   India plans to launch a satellite to a stationary point in an
orbit high above the earth's surface in 1999.

	   CHILANGUERA, El Salvador (AP) _ In past years, 9-year-old
Francisco Portillo asked for toys for Christmas.
	   This year, he dreams ``of waking up again in my house.''
	   Francisco, his two brothers and parents survived Hurricane Mitch
as the storm wrought destruction and death throughout Central
America. Their house was one of thousands lost to floods.
	   ``I hope Santa fixes our house,'' he says.
	   His village, which hugs a river and is surrounded by hills about
75 miles (120 kilometers) east of San Salvador, was almost buried
by mud on the morning of Oct. 30. More than 100 people vanished,
their bodies never found, according to survivors who clung to trees
or escaped into the hills.
	   A total of 84,000 El Salvadorans lost their homes, 175 people
died and 65 disappeared, according to the government. Some 9,000
people died across the region because of Mitch.
	   According to the Central American Economic Integration Bank, it
will cost dlrs 10 billion to repair damage to the economic
infrastructure in Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua.
	   What matters most to Francisco is his lost home.
	   ``My house was very pretty, and today look at how ugly this is,
because there is no place to sleep,'' said Francisco, peering
around the interior of his family's hastily built adobe shelter of
87 square feet (8 square meters).
	   ``Now we all sleep outside on the ground. We only use a mat,''
he said.
	   Francisco is one of hundreds of children in the Chilanguera
valley whose families lost their houses _ and sometimes their loved
ones _ to the storm. Farm animals were swept away or buried in
floods and mud. Rocks and barren trees now cover what were fields
of corn, sugar cane and grazing land.
	   ``Last Christmas, we made a fire, shot fireworks, played and
went to bed late,'' he said.
	   ``Now I will not ask God for toys, but for him to help us, that
he fixes my house,'' he said.
	   Francisco's family was one of the lucky ones.
	   Daisy Romero, 19, lost her 4-month-old daughter.
	   ``She slipped from my arms,'' Ms. Romero said.
	   Ms. Romero was carrying her child while removing tiles from the
roof of their house after it collapsed in a flood.
	   ``I fell. The girl slipped from me. I tried to grab her, but I
couldn't,'' she said, sobbing and clenching her hands.
	   ``This Christmas is going to be very sad because some have no
house and I have lost my girl.''

Dollar falls against yen on impeachment news; Japanese stocks

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with late afternoon currency, bond prices;
ADDS trader comment in 6th-7th grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Concern that impeachment proceedings in the United
States will leave Washington rudderless as the global economy
founders drove the U.S. dollar lower against the yen on Monday.
Japanese stocks fell.
	   The dollar bought 114.90 yen in late afternoon trading, down
0.30 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also below its late New York
level of 115.61 yen on Friday.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average ended three
straight sessions of gains with a drop of 41.34 points, or 0.29
percent, to close at 14,152.95. On Friday, the average closed up
67.30 points, or 0.48 percent.
	   With the U.S. House of Representative's vote Saturday to impeach
President Bill Clinton, the president's fate now rests in the
Senate, which can remove him from office with a two-thirds vote.
	   While there is doubt the Senate will impeach Clinton, a
prolonged trial could absorb Washington's attention and undermine
its ability to manage the U.S. and world economies, traders said.
	   ``The whole Clinton affair is negative for the dollar,'' said
Takashi Nakauchi, foreign exchange manager at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd.
	   ``The fact that the dollar didn't rise despite the war against
Iraq last week shows how weak the dollar is,'' he said.
	   The U.S. currency dipped as low as 114.70 yen in Tokyo after
moving as high as 115.97 yen in early morning trading.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices fell following the
dollar's drop and concerns about rising interest rates as the
Japanese government moves to issue more bonds to help pay for a
record budget deficit.
	   The Ministry of Finance decided Sunday to issue government bonds
totaling 71 trillion yen (dlrs 620 billion) next year, one-quarter
more than initially forecast.
	   Traders said that such a large issuance of government bonds
would drive long-term interest rates higher, raising borrowing
costs for Japan's already cash-strapped companies.
	   Making matters worse, the stronger yen was seen driving up the
prices of Japanese goods overseas, eroding profits at exporters,
which have been the recession-bound economy's one bright spot.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section lost 2.58 points, or 0.23 percent, to 1,099.12. The
TOPIX closed up 9.44 points, or 0.87 percent, on Friday.
	   Trading remained thin as many investors stayed on the sidelines
ahead of a national holiday on Wednesday in Japan. An estimated 246
million shares changed hands on the first section, down from 304
million on Friday.
	   Declining shares outnumbered risers three to two.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond jumped to 1.505 percent from Friday's finish of
1.320 percent, driving its price down to 102.44 yen from 104.04.

First woman conductor of Vienna Boys Choir quits
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY107 &QL; 
 &UR; By GEORGE JAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Her tenure was brief and her vision of
change short-lived. After less than two years on the job, the first
woman conductor of the Vienna Boys Choir is gone.
	   What caused the break between Agnes Grossmann and the ``Old
Boys'' _ the former choir members who run the organization _
depends on who's telling the story.
	   Mrs. Grossmann says she quit after a successful North American
tour because she was ``running up against a wall'' of resistance to
her ideas.
	   She wanted to add a fifth choir to help spread the workload of
about 300 concerts a year now shared by four choirs of about 25
boys each, but the president and board of directors said no.
	   In addition, the 52-year-old Mrs. Grossmann says the board
refused to consider her suggestions that the most self-supporting
organization seek sponsors and state support.
	   The choir's president, Karl-Heinz Schenk, faults Mrs. Grossmann
for the performance burden, saying she scheduled too many concerts
and demanded too much from the boys. And he says the issue of
financing fell outside her job as artistic director.
	   ``The trouble with Mrs. Grossmann is at some point she began to
believe that she personally was the Vienna Boys Choir,'' Schenk
said.
	   The public feud has marred celebrations marking the choir's
500th year and cast another shadow over Vienna's famed musical
institutions, long described as clannish and immune to change by
composers and conductors such as Gustav Mahler, Leonard Bernstein
and Lorin Maazel.
	   The tone is a far cry from two years ago, when Mrs. Grossmann
was named artistic director.
	   Her appointment was described by the organization as ``both a
tribute to her exceptional musical and leadership abilities and the
embodiment of a seismic shift in this venerable Viennese
institution as it moves into the 21st century.''
	   Change has been glacial at the Boys Choir since Habsburg Emperor
Maximilian I established it by decree in 1498.
	   The boys often had the best in musical education, with composers
such as Mozart, Salieri, Haydn, Gluck and Schubert leaving their
mark, either as choirboys themselves or as composers or conductors.
More recent conductors have included Arturo Toscanini, Bruno Walter
and Ricardo Muti.
	   But the ``Old Boys'' in charge have been secretive and often
autocratic, despite recent moves to loosen up the organization.
	   The measures include giving the boys more free time and allowing
girls to attend the school in the gilded 18th-century palace that
the Boys Choir calls home. The boys' parents also are now permitted
to attend more concerts _ something previous directors said
distracted the boys.
	   The boys themselves shrug off the bad publicity over Mrs.
Grossmann's departure.
	   ``I don't care what the papers write, I just want to keep on
singing,'' said Reinhard Gabriel, an impish 11-year-old with a
pageboy cut standing in the frenetic play area for the choir boys.
	   Mrs. Grossmann and others question whether the choir's
administrators are really ready to move into the 21st century.
	   ``They're convinced that the old ways are the best ways,'' Mrs.
Grossmann said. ``Here, in Austria, people often have a prefixed
idea _ almost like a wall that you cannot break through.''
	   Imre Szanto, who has a son singing with the choir, said the
all-male management ``acted like a bunch of machos'' to Mrs.
Grossmann. He wants the institution to be more open is forming a
parents association to add more weight to parents' demands.
	   ``We have little idea of what's going on. The leadership is not
accountable to anyone,'' he said. Former choirboy Hubertus Czernin,
a well-known Austrian journalist, says the leadership is bent on
keeping undisputed control.
	   Fulfilling Mrs. Grossmann's demands would have opened the door
to others ``perhaps less interested in the prestige of the
association and more in training musical talent,'' he wrote. ``But
precisely this is something rejected by the exclusive 'Boys'
Circle.' The Old Boys want to remain among themselves.''

Anwar's adopted brother released on bail in sex conviction

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The adopted brother of Malaysia's
former No. 2 leader was released on bail Monday as a court
reconsiders his conviction for having had sex with the jailed
politician.
	   Sukma Darmawan, 38, has been serving a six-month term for
allegedly allowing ex-deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim sodomize
him, a crime in this Muslim country.
	   Sukma says he was coerced by police into making a guilty plea.
His sentence ends in January.
	   While an appeals court on Saturday had denied a request for an
appeal, the federal High Court on Monday ordered that Sukma be
released on 10,000 ringgit bail (dlrs 2,632) until his case is
reviewed next month.
	   The decision could deal a blow to prosecutors in a separate
trial against Anwar, who had likely planned to use Sukma's
confession to a homosexual relationship as evidence in their case
against the former deputy premier.
	   Anwar, who faces charges of sexual misconduct and abuse power,
was ousted by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Sept. 2 and later
became the leader's biggest political rival.
	   Police arrested Anwar 18 days later in a move condemned by Anwar
and supporters as a thinly disguised effort to eliminate the prime
minister's top opponent.
	   Last week, one of Anwar's attorneys, Christopher Fernando, read
excerpts of an undated letter Sukma had written from jail shortly
after he pleaded guilty in September to allowing himself to be
sodomized by Anwar.
	   Fernando used the letter as an exhibit to support the defense
contention that police were enmeshed in a high-level conspiracy to
topple Anwar.
	   ``The police took all types of body hair from Sukma, and
conducted an anal test on him, which hurt him very much,'' said
Fernando.
	   Also serving a six-month sentence for confessing to having sex
with Anwar is the politician's former speech writer, Munawar Ahmad
Anees. He, too, has appealed his conviction, saying he was tortured
and coerced by police into pleading guilty.

Prosecution witness says police forced retraction
</HEADLINE>

details from witness.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A key prosecution witness in the
trial against Malaysia's former No. 2 leader, Anwar Ibrahim,
testified Monday that police threatened to send her to jail if she
didn't retract a claim that her brother's wife slept with Anwar.
	   ``I was tortured mentally to force me to change my mind,'' Ummi
Hafilda Ali testified during the opening of the seventh week of a
trial that has consumed the capital city.
	   Anwar, ousted Sept. 2 as deputy prime minister and finance
minister, is on trial for 10 counts of sodomy, adultery and abuse
of power.
	   The government's case was prompted by accusations by Ummi, the
sister of Anwar's private secretary, and Azizan Abu Bakar, a former
driver for the politician's family.
	   Ummi wrote a letter to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in 1997
in which she alleged that her brother's wife had committed adultery
with Anwar. Police investigations concluded the charges were false
and Mahathir halted the investigations against his deputy.
	   Ummi told the court Monday that she was arrested Aug. 17, after
having written the letter to Mahathir. She and Azizan were grilled
for seven hours, Ummi testified.
	   ``I was interrogated roughly and was also threatened,'' she
said, adding that Deputy Superintendent of Police Aziz Husin told
her she would be held for two years under the Internal Security Act
if she did not write a retraction.
	   ``Almost every half hour, DSP Aziz Husin threatened to send me
to Jalan Travers police station together with drug addicts and
prostitutes. It frightened me at the time,'' she testified.
	   Ummi said she was constantly followed by strangers and grew
concerned for her safety and that of her family.
	   She testified that she was contacted by a police official who
told her to go to a luxury hotel. There, she was met by other
police officials who told her top officials were not pleased with
her letter of retraction.
	   They demanded she make a public apology on state-run television.
	   ``I refused because this might jeopardize my credibility as a
person with principles,'' Ummi testified, to snickers from some of
Anwar's relatives in the courtroom.
	   After refusing to make a public apology, Ummi said the police
then presented her with a letter of retraction for her to sign, one
that was more in favor of Anwar.
	   ``I finally signed it after I was forced once against by DSP
Aziz Husin,'' she told the court.
	   Still, on Monday Ummi stood by her original letter to Mahathir.
	   She wrote the letter ``to request the prime minister to save my
brother Azmin Ali from working with a person who betrayed him -- a
person with low morals called Anwar Ibrahim.''
	   Ummi said she called on the prime minister to investigate her
sex charges and asked for police protection.
	   Anwar has denied all the accusations against him, saying they
were cooked up to eliminate his challenge to Mahathir's
17-year-rule. The ousted politician, whose wife has formed a
political reform party on his behalf, claims a high-level
government conspiracy is out to ruin his career.

Wei Jingsheng calls for mutual support at start of Taiwan visit

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Exiled Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng
arrived in Taiwan on Monday, saying he looked forward to witnessing
the island's freedoms first hand and urging Taiwanese to support
the democracy movement in mainland China.
	   ``We hope to meet with (Taiwanese) leaders from all sides, to
see, to talk, and to exchange views on the full range of topics,''
Wei told reporters on arrival at Taipei's Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport.
	   ``For everyone involved, information received through direct
contacts is surely more accurate that news overheard.''
	   Wei said he hoped for wide ranging discussions on human rights
in Asia and would encourage mutual support of human rights
campaigners in China and throughout the region.
	   During his nine day visit, Wei will be received by top
government officials, including President Lee Teng-hui and Premier
Vincent Siew, along with officials of the ruling Nationalist Party.
	   He was quoted by a newspaper published on Sunday as saying he
would discuss assistance and funding with people in Taiwan, but
wouldn't accept political conditions attached to any such aid.
	   Wei's first-ever visit here highlights Taiwan's calls for more
democracy in China, as well as the sensitive relationship between
Taipei and Beijing, which split politically amid civil war in 1949.
	   The Nationalists say Taiwan's peaceful transition to democracy
over the last decade should be a model for China, which in size,
population, and development challenges, dwarfs this newly-affluent
island of 21 million people.
	   They say reunification between the sides can only happen after
China democratizes, though many in the overseas Chinese democracy
movement have accused Taiwan of failing to back up its rhetoric
with substantive support.
	   While Wei embraces calls for democracy in China, he will likely
speak cautiously about Taiwan's drive for a higher international
profile that China considers tantamount to secession _ a charge far
more serious than advocating democracy.
	   Wei will also meet heads of the opposition New Party, which
backs reunification with China, and the Democratic Progressive
Party, which calls for Taiwan's formal and permanent independence
from China.
	   Wei, who was released from a Chinese prison after 18 years in
prison off-and-on, is visiting at the invitation of the private
World League for Freedom and Democracy.

South Korean has his feet cut off in insurance scam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Police in South Korea said Monday they
had uncovered a bizarre scam in which a heavily indebted grocer
hired an acquaintance to cut off his feet to collect 2 billion won
(dlrs 1.7 million) in insurance money.
	   Chung Kyu-chil, 51, told police his feet were missing when he
awoke in his shop early in the morning of Dec. 11 after a heavy
drinking bout the night before. He said a customer found him
bleeding heavily and took him to hospital.
	   Police at first suspected Chung's creditors, because his family
reported he had run up dlrs 250,000 in stock market and gambling
losses.
	   But police later found Chung had taken out two dozen insurance
policies in the last three months that would pay him up to dlrs 1.7
million if he became accidentally disabled.
	   Chung then admitted to investigators that he had hired Kim
Kui-yong, 41, a taxi driver, to sever his feet at the ankle,
promising to pay him dlrs 4l,600 if the scam was successful.
	   The taxi driver told police that he cut off Chung's feet with an
axe and dumped them into the Han River in Seoul.
	   Police arrested the taxi driver on assault charges late Sunday
night. However, they said they have no legal grounds to arrest
Chung because he has not tried to collect the insurance.
	   ``No money was exchanged in this case, so it's impossible to
punish him,'' Police Lt. Lim Yong-bin said.
	   ``I'm sorry for my wife and my daughter. I regret what I did,''
Chung told local reporters from his hospital bed.

South Korean warship fires warning shots at Japanese fishing boat

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with more details of incident from Japanese
coast guard

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A South Korean warship fired several warning shots
Monday near a Japanese boat fishing for tuna in waters between the
two countries, Japan's coast guard said.
	   Several shots landed about 10 meters (330 feet) from the vessel
piloted by 41-year-old Eiji Yamamoto, but the Japanese fisherman
was unhurt, said Shinji Sezaki, a spokesman for Japan's coast
guard.
	   The incident occurred about 10 kilometers (6 miles) east of the
site where South Korean navy ships sunk a North Korean speedboat in
a gunbattle last Friday, Sezaki said.
	   The warship initially ordered Yamamoto to move away using light,
whistle and microphone signals, but the fisherman did not heed the
warning, said another coast guard spokesman, Eiji Nagano.
	   Yamamoto told Japanese authorities that he had not noticed the
preliminary warnings, Nagano said. The subsequent life fire rounds
might have been fired from a machine gun, he said.
	   When contacted by Japan's Maritime Safety Agency, the South
Korean navy confirmed that it had fired warning shots near
Yamamoto's 4.9-ton vessel, Sezaki said.
	   The reason the shots were fired was not immediately known, he
added.
	   Yamamoto told Japanese officials that the warnings shots were
fired after the South Korean boat chased him away from a point
about 90 kilometers (56 miles) southwest of Izuhara, Nagasaki
Prefecture (state).
	   In Friday's incident, South Korean navy ships and aircraft sank
the North Korean vessel, described as a low-slung, speedboat used
to drop off or pick up spies, after a six-hour chase.
	   South Korean navy vessels are now searching a suspected mother
ship, which is believed to have taken the sunken speedboat boat
toward the South Korean shore before Friday's incident. Nagano said
the Japanese coast guard has not been asked to assist in the
search.
	   Japan's coast guard warned Japanese fishing boats to be careful
in their operations in the Korean Straight between Japan's southern
main island of Kyushu and Korea.

Parliamentary showdown set over Netanyahu's peace policies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Changes byline, recasts with detail about potential
parliamentary scenarios. Knesset to convene at about 4 p.m. (1400
GMT). Timing of any votes uncertain &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's fractious
ruling coalition appeared poised Monday to finally crack apart,
ushering in what could be weeks or even months of paralysis on the
Israeli-Palestinian peace front.
	   On Monday, Israel's parliament was to take up a welter of
measures that _ taken separately or together _ are seen as a broad
referendum on the peace process.
	   Those include a no-confidence motion against Netanyahu's
government _ perhaps more than one _ plus a possible measure to set
early elections, along with a separate vote by lawmakers on
Netanyahu's latest stance toward the Palestinians.
	   In the two months since the signing of the U.S.-brokered Wye
River land-for-security accords, the prime minister has been under
fire from both supporters and opponents of the peace process _ for
very different reasons.
	   The Israeli left accuses Netanyahu of bad faith and
foot-dragging, saying the prime minister never intended to live up
to promises made under the landmark Oslo accords signed by slain
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   Since Netanyahu took office in May 1996, the peace proces has
been largely stalled. The signing of the Wye accords on Oct. 23 in
Washington represented a dramatic break in what had been a 19-month
deadlock.
	   The accord's right-wing opponents, among them Jewish settlers,
have expressed fury at Netanyahu for agreeing to hand over more
West Bank land to the Palestinians in exchange for security steps.
Previously, he had promised to fight any such concessions.
	   Setting the stage for Monday's parliamentary action, Netanyahu's
Cabinet on Sunday approved a tough set of conditions for resuming
Israel's compliance with the Wye accords. Netanyahu said he would
hold a vote to check lawmakers' views of that move.
	   Netanyahu says the conditions _ including a demand that Arafat
renounce his intentions to declare independence by the end of May
are justified because the Palestinians have not met obligations
under the agreement.
	   The Palestinians say they have, and denounce the delays as
unfair and inflammatory.
	   One of several scenarios could unfold in the Knesset later
Monday.
	   A successful no-confidence motion would mean new elections would
be held within 60 days. Even Netanyahu's allies acknowledge he
would likely lose; he holds only a one-seat majority in the
120-seat house, and support from his coalition partners has
crumbled.
	   Another possibility is a passage of a separate measure calling
for early elections _ which Netanyahu himself may support. If it is
approved, the bill would then return to the Knesset law committee
for debate and then back to the floor for two more readings before
becoming law.
	   Alternatively, Netanyahu and the opposition could simply agree
on an election date, expected to be in April. On the eve of the
vote, 67 Knesset members said they would support early elections.
	   Yet another potential move would be Netanyahu's resignation,
which would trigger elections within 60 days. That was considered
unlikely, however.
	   The timetable on early elections _ whether within 60 days or
later _ could be an important consideration because of constraints
faced by a prime potential opponent, Lt. Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak.
	   Shahak, who has been on leave since stepping down as army chief
of staff in July, would announce his retirement from the military
once elections were called, Israel radio reported Sunday.
	   Under law, Shahak would be banned from participating in politics
for 100 days after his departure from the armed forces. But with a
presidential dispensation, that could be shortened to 50 days.
	   Little is known of Shahak's policies. As a soldier, he is
prohibited from expressing an opinion, but his deep involvement in
the peace talks suggests he is a moderate who favors territorial
concessions.
	   Polls have suggested that a centrist bid by Shahak would likely
push Labor Party leader Ehud Barak out of the race in the first
round of voting and lead to a run-off between Netanyahu and Shahak.
	   Barak, whose party began the Israel-Palestinian peace process in
1993, told Israel TV a Shahak bid would be an ``unnecessary
division of strengths.''

Singapore's key economic indicator falls sharply in November

 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES explanation of economic indicator in lead graf.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore said Monday that its key economic
indicator, which charts exports of non-oil domestically produced
goods, fell a greater-than-expected 6.5 percent in November
compared to a year ago, signaling it remains entrenched in its
worst slump in decades.
	   ``The worsening economic conditions in the five crisis-ridden
economies (Japan, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Thailand and Korea), which
account for 42.8 percent of Singapore's trade, as well as the
lackluster global demand for certain electronic products, continued
to take its toll,'' the Southeast Asian island republic's Trade
Development Board said in a statement.
	   Exports of electronics, which drive Singapore's manufacturing
sector and typically account for about 70 percent of non-oil
domestic exports, fell 7.6 percent on the year in November due to
global over-capacity and price weakness, the trade board said.
	   ``The November number is a real shocker,'' Song Seng Wun,
regional economist at GK Goh Holdings, told Dow Jones Newswires.
``It's really terrible. We had expected the electronics industry to
stabilize, but instead we saw a decline.''
	   The poor showing in November came after non-oil exports had
grown 5 percent in August and 1.7 percent in September before
slumping 5.2 percent in October.
	   Total non-oil exports last month equaled 7.52 billion Singapore
dollars (dlrs 4.56 billion), according to the board, which added
that total trade fell in dollar terms for the eighth consecutive
month in November.
	   The government has officially forecast an expansion of gross
domestic product this year between 0.5 percent and 1.0 percent, but
has warned that a full-blown recession might ensue next year.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Finance Ministry revealed a national budget
plan on Monday that would boost overall spending by a record 5.4
percent next fiscal year in an effort to jump-start the nation's
flagging economy.
	   Allocating 81.860 trillion yen (dlrs 710.6 billion) in
government outlays, the expansionary policy is a turnaround from
last year's austere budget of former Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto.
	   In the new budget, public works spending would jump over 10
percent to about 10 trillion yen (dlrs 86.8 billion), the Finance
Ministry said.
	   Tax revenues are expected to plunge 19.5 percent next year to
47.119 trillion yen (dlrs 409.0 billion), reflecting massive tax
cuts planned for 1999 and the weak economy, the Finance Ministry
said.
	   Japan's budget deficit, already one of the highest in the
industrialized world, would surge as a result of the proposed
spending.
	   But in a nation suffering its worst recession since World War
II, the stimulus is essential for economic recovery, the Finance
Ministry said.
	   The budget announcement comes a day after Japan set its economic
growth target for next year at 0.5 percent _ the lowest forecast
since the World War II.
	   ___
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ In contrast to other air carries based in the
Pacific region which have been hard-hit by the Asian financial
crisis, Fiji's national airline Air Pacific plans to increase its
carrying capacity by 70 percent in 1999, the airline said Monday.
	   Chief executive Michael McQuay told a Fiji tourism industry
meeting that Air Pacific had signed a codesharing agreement with
American Airlines and would enter a strategic alliance with a major
Asian carrier in the first quarter of 1999.
	   The airline plans to boost the number of flights to existing
destinations in North America and Australia and add new
destinations.
	   ``We have a tremendous increase in capacity,'' McQuay said.
	   McQuay, a vice-president of Hawaiian Airlines until being
recruited to reorganize Air Pacific, said that in 1999 capacity
would be increased by 70 percent, to nine flights weekly from Fiji
to Sydney, daily to Brisbane and four times weekly to Melbourne.
	   Regular service also was planned for two other Australian
cities.
	   From June 1999, a route connecting Fiji to Los Angeles nonstop
will be flown four or five times a week. Service to two other North
American destinations were planned as well.
	   A twice-weekly service to Tokyo now operated by a Boeing 767
jetliner will be switched to a larger Boeing 747, and an
application will be made for permission to run a third service to
Japan.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's trade surplus with the world fell 15
percent in November from the same month last year, its first fall
in almost two years, the government said Monday.
	   The merchandise trade surplus, the measure of all goods exported
by Japan minus those imported, dropped to 902 billion yen (dlrs 7.8
billion) from 1.1 trillion yen (dlrs 9.6 billion) the year before,
the Ministry of Finance said.
	   The ministry said it was the surplus' first decline in 20
months. In October, it had surged 24 percent to 1.4 trillion yen
(dlrs 12.2 billion).
	   The numbers surprised economists surveyed by Dow Jones
Newswires, who had predicted a slight increase.
	   While the ministry said it was impossible to access the trade
situation from one month's figures, they could point to a slowing
down of Japan's export industries, which had been the only engine
of growth in an otherwise lackluster economy.
	   The figures also showed a drop in the amount of goods imported
by Japan as consumers tighten their purse strings further amid the
longest recession in half a century.
	   Japan's surplus shrank or held even against all other regions of
the world except the United States, where it grew by 1 percent to
488 billion yen (dlrs 4.2 billion) _ or more than half the total
surplus, the ministry said.
	   The biggest decline was in exports to the rest of Asia, which
remains mired in a 17-month-old economic crisis. Japan's surplus
with its neighbors plunged by two-thirds to 184 billion yen (dlrs
1.6 billion), the ministry said.
	   ___
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The government said Monday that Singapore's key
economic indicator _ non-oil domestic exports _ fell 6.5 percent in
November against the same month last year, presenting further
evidence that the city-state remains entrenched in its worst
economic downturn since independence.
	   The figure was lower than most analysts' expectations of a mild
November export contraction in this vulnerable economy, about two
thirds of which relies on trade.
	   ``The worsening economic conditions in the five crisis-ridden
economies (Japan, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Thailand and Korea), which
account for 42.8 percent of Singapore's trade, as well as the
lackluster global demand for certain electronic products, continued
to take its toll on Singapore's external trade,'' the Trade
Development Board said.
	   Compared with the same periods in 1997, non-oil domestic exports
grew 5 percent in August and 1.7 percent in September before
slumping 5.2 percent in October.
	   Total non-oil exports last month equaled 7.52 billion Singapore
dollars (dlrs 4.56 billion), according to the board, which added
that total trade fell in dollar terms for the eighth consecutive
month in November.
	   Singapore has entered a technical recession, and looks set to
post only marginal overall growth for 1998.
	   The government has forecast an expansion of gross domestic
product this year between 0.5 percent and 1.0 percent, but has
warned that a full-blown recession might ensue next year.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai sugar producers should stop
relying on government subsidies and concentrate on increasing
efficiency and yields to boost revenues, according to a report
released Monday by the country's top think tank.
	   The conclusions by the Thailand Development Research Institute
come as sugar producers have threatened to shut down mills unless
the government allows them to raise prices.
	   Thailand is one the world's largest producers of sugar, but
domestic sugar prices are controlled by the government, and
producers have complained bitterly during the past two years that
prices are too low. At one point, they held back sugar from the
market, creating a shortage.
	   The TDRI study said sugarcane growers have to improve
efficiency. A revamp of the industry based on its partial
liberalization is now needed, it said.
	   The industry is now faced with low yields, while production
capacity is too high, the study said. This leads to high production
costs, especially when compared with its main competitor,
Australia.
	   Thailand produced 42.2 million metric tons of sugarcane for
1997-98 crop year and is expected to produce 42.6 million tons of
sugarcane for 1998-99 crop season. The production capacity,
meanwhile, is as high as 80 million tons.
	   ``Cutting price controls will help to improve sugarcane prices
and, eventually, sugarcane growers' earnings,'' responded Kamthorn
Kittichotesap, secretary general of the Sugarcane Planters
Association Zone 7.

South Korean warship fires warning shots at Japanese fishing boat

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A South Korean warship fired several warning shots
Monday near a Japanese boat fishing for tuna in international
waters between the two countries, Japan's coast guard said.
	   Several shots landed about 10 meters (330 feet) from the vessel
piloted by 41-year-old Eiji Yamamoto, but the Japanese fisherman
was unhurt, said Shinji Sezaki, a spokesman for Japan's coast
guard.
	   The incident occurred about 10 kilometers (6 miles) east of the
site where South Korean navy ships sunk a North Korean speedboat in
a gunbattle last Friday, Sezaki said.
	   The warship initially ordered Yamamoto to move away using light,
whistle and microphone signals, but the fisherman did not heed the
warning, said another coast guard spokesman, Eiji Nagano.
	   Yamamoto told Japanese authorities that he had not noticed the
preliminary warnings, Nagano said. The subsequent life fire rounds
might have been fired from a machine gun, he said.
	   When contacted by Japan's Maritime Safety Agency, the South
Korean navy confirmed that it had fired warning shots near
Yamamoto's 4.9-ton vessel, Sezaki said.
	   The reason the shots were fired was not immediately known, he
added.
	   Yamamoto told Japanese officials that the warnings shots were
fired after the South Korean boat chased him away from a point
about 90 kilometers (56 miles) southwest of Izuhara, Nagasaki
Prefecture (state).
	   In Friday's incident, South Korean navy ships and aircraft sank
the North Korean vessel, described as a low-slung, speedboat used
to drop off or pick up spies, after a six-hour chase.
	   South Korean navy vessels are now searching a suspected mother
ship, which is believed to have taken the sunken speedboat boat
toward the South Korean shore before Friday's incident. Nagano said
the Japanese coast guard has not been asked to assist in the
search.
	   Japan's coast guard warned Japanese fishing boats to be careful
in their operations in the Korean Straight between Japan's southern
main island of Kyushu and Korea.

Saddam hails Iraqis for standing firm against enemies

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqis have been victorious against
``enemies of God'' during four days of U.S.-British airstrikes,
Saddam Hussein said in his first public comments since the attacks
ended.
	   U.N. officials said humanitarian workers would return to Baghdad
on Tuesday. Meanwhile, extremist Muslim groups threatened
retaliation for the bombardment of Iraq.
	   The Iraqi president said in a brief speech Sunday on radio and
television that the Iraqi people and the army have proved to be
``worthy of what your leadership expected from you.''
	   ``God will repay well and crown your heart with clear victory,''
he said.
	   No final casualty toll has been released, but previous reports
indicated at least 42 Iraqis were killed and 96 wounded in the
strikes, which unleashed the most severe firepower since the 1991
Gulf War. Iraqi forces offered little resistance, other than
anti-aircraft fire.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, claimed Sunday the toll
was much higher.
	   ``Casualties are in the thousands in terms of people killed or
wounded, but we don't have any final figure,'' he told CNN. ``There
has been enormous damage mainly to the civilian infrastructure and
to human lives.''
	   In halting the strikes, President Bill Clinton said the 70-hour
assault severely damaged Iraq's ability to build weapons of mass
destruction.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Sunday the United
States might strike again if Saddam rebuilds his weapons of mass
destruction.
	   ``We reserve the right to use force again,'' Albright said on
NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
	   Iraqi officials have not allowed reporters to inspect areas
where the most extensive damage occurred, including presidential
palaces and defense installations.
	   U.N. officials said that more than 100 U.N. workers who
supervise food aid for Iraqis will return to Baghdad on Tuesday.
They were evacuated to the Jordanian capital Amman last week amid
the U.S.-British bombardment.
	   A statement issued by U.N. spokesman John Mills in New York said
oil monitors from the Dutch company Saybolt have remained on duty
and that teams from the British firm Lloyds Register had been asked
to return immediately to certify incoming food shipments.
	   Extremist Islamic groups, meanwhile, threatened retaliation for
the airstrikes on Iraq.
	   Al-Gamaa al-Islamiya, or the Islamic Group, said in a statement
sent to the Cairo office of Al-Hayat newspaper that the attacks
were ``a disgrace to the Islamic nation,'' the paper reported
Monday.
	   The group called for a ``holy war'' against the United States
and a boycott of American and British products in the Muslim world,
the paper said. It also called trying ``those who live in the White
House as war criminals.''
	   Anonymous calls to Al-Hayat also threatened attacks on Kuwaiti
embassies and ``American interests'' in the Gulf.
	   The rhetoric in Iraq's state-run newspapers Monday was as
strident as before the assault and repeated the government's
assertion that it was the winner.
	   ``Victorious, as the bad bid has failed,'' said the headline in
Al-Qadissiya.
	   In his speech, Saddam also criticized the Arab world for
pretending to be ``asleep ... or sick'' and not supporting Iraq.
	   ``A new aggression (was) started by the enemies of God and the
nation. With it, the resistance started again,'' he said.
	   After calling off the attacks, Clinton said he hoped that U.N.
weapons inspectors would be able to go back to Iraq to resume their
7 1-2-year mission to search and destroy illegal weapons. The
airstrikes were launched on the grounds that Iraq was obstructing
the work of the weapons inspectors of the U.N. Special Commission,
or UNSCOM.
	   But Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan declared Saturday
night that UNSCOM's ``mission is over.''
	   Baghdad was bustling with normal activity, but in the streets,
there was anger.
	   If ``Clinton has achieved his mission, why does he say the
inspectors must return?'' asked Ali Mahmoud Abdel Munaim, an
unemployed 32-year-old man. He added that if everything illegal has
been destroyed in the airstrikes, ``the next step ought to be
lifting of sanctions.''
	   The U.N. economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait cannot be lifted until UNSCOM certifies that Iraq is free
of all nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and long-range
missiles.
	   UNSCOM chief Richard Butler said it was necessary to get the
monitors back into Iraq, telling Associated Press Television News
that the inspections were ``a test case in the field of
nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction.''
	   After the strikes, many Iraqis were coming to terms with the
blows the missiles dealt to their lives.
	   Adil Mohammed Nori, a 50-year-old spice store owner, said he was
preparing to drive 185 miles to the southern town of Ali al-Gharbi.
Asked why, he said: ``To attend a funeral for a mass destruction
weapon that Clinton has destroyed: my 12-year-old niece.''
	   He said the girl, Zehra, was killed in one of the missile
strikes.
	   The Pentagon says 425 Tomahawk cruise missiles were fired during
the campaign _ more than the number fired in the entire five-week
Gulf War to evict Iraq from Kuwait. Iraq says its gunners shot down
more than 100 Tomahawks.
	   The offensive involved 650 aircraft missions, including 32
sorties by 12 British Tornado fighter-bombers.
	   When Clinton called a halt to the attack, it apparently caught
the British by surprise. The Royal Air Force had to recall four
Tornadoes that were already en route from Kuwait to Iraq to bomb
Republican Guard positions, said Group Capt. Bryan Collins.

Parliamentary showdown set over Netanyahu's peace policies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Changes byline, recasts with detail about potential
parliamentary scenarios. Knesset to convene at about 1400 GMT.
Timing of any votes uncertain &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's fractious
ruling coalition appeared poised Monday to crumble, ushering in
what could be weeks or even months of paralysis on the
Israeli-Palestinian peace front.
	   On Monday, Israel's parliament was to take up a welter of
measures that _ taken separately or together _ are seen as a broad
referendum on the peace process.
	   Those include a no-confidence motion against Netanyahu's
government _ perhaps more than one _ plus a possible measure to set
early elections, along with a separate vote by lawmakers on
Netanyahu's latest stance toward the Palestinians.
	   In the two months since the signing of the U.S.-brokered Wye
River land-for-security accords, Netanyahu has been under fire from
both supporters and opponents of the peace process for different
reasons.
	   The Israeli left accuses Netanyahu of bad faith and
foot-dragging, saying he never intended to live up to promises made
under the landmark Oslo accords signed by then-Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   Since Netanyahu took office in May 1996, the peace proces has
been largely stalled. The signing of the Wye accords on Oct. 23 in
Washington represented a dramatic break in what had been a 19-month
deadlock.
	   The accord's right-wing opponents, among them Jewish settlers,
have expressed fury at Netanyahu for agreeing to hand over more
West Bank land to the Palestinians in exchange for security steps.
Previously, he had promised to fight any such concessions.
	   Setting the stage for Monday's parliamentary action, Netanyahu's
Cabinet on Sunday approved a tough set of conditions for resuming
Israel's compliance with the Wye accords. Netanyahu said he would
hold a vote to check lawmakers' views of that move.
	   Netanyahu says the conditions _ including a demand that Arafat
renounce his intentions to declare independence by the end of May _
are justified because the Palestinians have not met obligations
under the agreement.
	   The Palestinians say they have, and denounce the delays as
unfair and inflammatory.
	   One of several scenarios could unfold in the Knesset later
Monday.
	   A successful no-confidence motion would mean new elections would
be held within 60 days. Even Netanyahu's allies acknowledge he
would likely lose; he holds only a one-seat majority in the
120-seat house, and support from his coalition partners has
crumbled.
	   Another possibility is a passage of a separate measure calling
for early elections _ which Netanyahu himself may support. If
approved, the bill would then return to the Knesset law committee
for debate and then back to the floor for two more readings before
becoming law.
	   Alternatively, Netanyahu and the opposition could simply agree
on an election date, expected to be in April. On the eve of the
vote, 67 Knesset members said they would support early elections.
	   Yet another potential move would be Netanyahu's resignation,
which would trigger elections within 60 days. That was considered
unlikely, however.
	   The timetable on early elections _ whether within 60 days or
later _ could be an important consideration because of constraints
faced by a prime potential opponent, Lt. Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak.
	   Shahak, who has been on leave since stepping down as army chief
of staff in July, would announce his retirement from the military
once elections were called, Israel radio reported Sunday.
	   Under law, Shahak would be banned from participating in politics
for 100 days after his departure from the armed forces. But with a
presidential dispensation, that could be shortened to 50 days.
	   Little is known of Shahak's policies. As a soldier, he is
prohibited from expressing an opinion, but his deep involvement in
the peace talks suggests he is a moderate who favors territorial
concessions.
	   Polls have suggested a centrist bid by Shahak would likely push
Labor Party leader Ehud Barak out of the race in the first round of
voting and lead to a run-off between Netanyahu and Shahak.
	   Barak, whose party began the Israel-Palestinian peace process in
1993, told Israel TV a Shahak bid would be an ``unnecessary
division of strengths.''

Indonesian government says East Timorese rebel chief to stay in
</HEADLINE>
jail
 &UR; Eds: One name only for Muladi, Suharto is correct.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ East Timor's rebel chief will not be
included among as many as 50 political prisoners who will be
released to mark the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, the Indonesian
government said Monday.
	   Arrested in 1992, separatist guerrilla leader Xanana Gusmao is
serving a 20-year sentence in a Jakarta jail for fighting the
Indonesian military, which invaded East Timor in 1975.
	   However, Gusmao remains a key figure in talks on a peaceful
solution to the long-running conflict in the former Portuguese
colony. He met Monday for the second time in a week with U.N. envoy
Jamsheed Marker, who is mediating negotiations between Indonesia
and Portugal.
	   Justice Minister Muladi said that starting next week, between 40
and 50 political prisoners in jails across Indonesia will be
released. They include separatists from the provinces of Aceh, East
Timor and Irian Jaya.
	   ``Xanana is not included because he is linked with the solution
of the East Timor issue,'' Muladi said.
	   Ramadan began Sunday. Ninety percent of Indonesia's 200 million
people are Muslim.
	   Before meeting Gusmao at Cipinang jail, Marker visited
Indonesian military chief Gen. Wiranto at the defense ministry.
	   This weekend, the U.N. envoy, met an array of pro- and
anti-independence leaders in East Timor and said a U.N.-sponsored
peace deal was within grasp.
	   Peace talks were revitalized earlier this year after Jakarta
offered to grant autonomy to East Timor in exchange for
international recognition of Indonesian sovereignty.
	   The United Nations does not recognize Jakarta's authority in
East Timor, where Indonesian troops have been accused of widespread
human rights abuses in the last two decades.
	   Trying to improve Indonesia's human rights record, President
B.J. Habibie has freed 73 political prisoners since coming to power
in May in the wake of the ouster of authoritarian predecessor
Suharto.
	   More than 130 political prisoners remain behind bars across the
country, all of whom were jailed by Suharto. Riots and protests
helped force the 77-year-old former army general to quit.

Taiwan ruling party-owned company takes over troubled bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A company owned by Taiwan's ruling party
will acquire a 22.5 percent stake in Pan Asia Bank in the first
takeover of a Taiwanese bank attributed to the island's economic
woes, officials said Monday.
	   The Nationalist Party-owned Central Investment Holding Corp.
said a management team of Global Bank, a bank being set up by the
company, will take over the Pan Asia Bank.
	   The takeover of Pan Asia is the latest in a series of
government-supported rescues of companies and banks that have
reported financial problems.
	   Pan Asia suffered massive deposit withdrawals last month amid
reports that it has incurred extensive bad loans.
	   Some lawmakers also questioned if Pan Asia, owned by the
Everfortune Group, had made improper loans to other subsidiaries in
the group.
	   Everfortune Chairman Yang Tien-sheng told reporters his group
has suffered from the liquidity crunch and would use the proceeds
from the Pan Asia sale to repay some of its debts.
	   Hit by a regional financial crisis, many Taiwanese businesses
have faced cash-flow problems and have become unable to pay back
debts they ran up in better times.
	   Everfortune and a few other business groups have been accused of
propping up shares of companies in their groups with loans obtained
from affiliated financial institutions.
	   The financial troubles have hurt many of Taiwan's 47 commercial
banks, which have already faced keen competition after the
government ended a ban on the establishment of new banks in 1991.
	   In September, 4.95 percent of bank loans were overdue loans, a
record high ratio.
	   The banks' average return on net worth has dropped to 8 percent
this year, compared with 20 percent in 1990.
	   Financial Ministry officials said they would tighten up
regulations on the establishment of new banks and encourage bank
mergers.

Liberals capture majority of votes in St. Petersburg elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREW KRAMER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Liberal candidates capitalized on
voter anger at increased lawlessness in St. Petersburg, and won the
largest share of seats in city council elections, according to
preliminary results Monday.
	   St. Petersburg, the country's second-largest city after Moscow,
has long had liberal leanings, though liberal groups nationwide
have been in disarray recently.
	   The election was seen as a test of their strength, and the poll
also attracted nationwide attention after a leading liberal
politician was killed in the city last month.
	   A liberal party led by local politician Yuri Boldyrev captured
15 of 50 seats on the council, and the reformist Yabloko party won
seven, according to the City Electoral Commission. Independent
candidates, some of whom were associated with those two groups, won
15.
	   Communists won five seats and two smaller parties, both with
liberal leanings, won two places, according to the preliminary
results.
	   Still, observers said the vote was not the sweeping victory for
liberals as was initially expected. Yabloko was predicted to win
far more seats, and many of the independent victors were affiliated
with the Communist party and St. Petersburg's governor.
	   ``Is this a victory for democracy? It's not that
straightforward,'' said said Leonid Kesselman, a sociologist and
political columnist.
	   Sunday's vote was a runoff election after only six of the 50
seats were filled in the first round of voting earlier this month.
Sunday's turnout of about 30 percent was marred by reports of
election violations.
	   Observers said there were cases of vote buying and busing
pensioners, who tend to vote for Communists, to the election sites.
Some losers immediately demanded recounts.
	   ``One or two districts may be contested,'' said City Election
Commission head Alexander Garusov. ``Such cases could occur, but
they will be individual instances.''
	   The new deputies will enter a city council that grants its
members a much stronger voice in local affairs than similar bodies
elsewhere in Russia.
	   The campaign leading up to the election was marred by intrigue
and violence. Attackers beat one candidate with metal rods, and the
windows of a city council member's apartment were shot out.
	   The most shocking event, however, was the death of Galina
Starovoitova, one of the country's leading liberal politicians. She
was killed by unidentified gunmen on Nov. 20 outside her St.
Petersburg apartment.
	   Starovoitova's death galvanized St. Petersburg's 3.7 million
voters, who seemed fed up with the city's crime and corruption, and
its poor economic performance.

Two killed, 30 injured in clashes in Bangladesh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Rival political groups fought pitched
battles with bombs and guns, killing two people and injuring at
least 30 others in southern Bangladesh, police said Monday.
	   Student wings of the ruling Awami League party and the main
opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party clashed Sunday in the town
of Feni, 128 kilometers (80 miles) southeast of Dhaka. Feni is an
Awami League stronghold. Such political violence is common in
Bangladesh.
	   Witnesses said a group armed with bombs and guns attacked and
ransacked the homes of local BNP leaders. Some homes were set on
fire, and the wife of one BNP leader was injured.
	   The gunshots and explosions created panic. The local
administration called in armed border guards to restore peace.
	   Opposition supporters, meanwhile, used mosque loudspeakers to
call for help, witnesses said, and then fighting broke out.
Opposition activists ransacked and torched the houses of their
rivals.
	   Police confirmed 30 people were injured but did not say how many
were arrested. One person each from the ruling and the opposition
party was killed, and 13 of the 30 injured were in critical
condition, police said.
	   All shops and businesses remained closed Monday. Police
reinforcements were called in from neighboring towns.

Blewett hits century against England
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ Greg Blewett's unbeaten 169 was the
highlight of the third day of a four-day cricket match Monday
between England and the Australian XI.
	   At stumps, England was 166-2 in its second innings for a lead of
342. The Australians declared at 293-4, 176 behind England's first
innings of 469-6.
	   On Monday morning, Blewett and Matthew Elliott showed why they
are the best non-test opening pair in the world.
	   By the time Elliott got a leading edge to Ben Hollioake and was
out for 81, the pair had put on 206 in 249 minutes.
	   A mini-collapse followed, however, Corey Richards going for a
duck and Darren Lehmann for a lone boundary.
	   Stuart Law (21) steadied the innings before being caught on the
stroke of tea.
	   Shortly after Lehmann declared in an effort to breathe life into
a match that has been dominated by the bat.
	   A week ago Blewett hit 152 in Hobart for South Australia against
Tasmania. (djp)

New Zealand XI win by 66 runs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUNEDIN, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand gave an early glimpse of
its batting strength in the form of Stephen Fleming and Craig
McMillan as it easily overpowered an Indian XI in a limited-overs
cricket match at Carisbrook Oval on Monday.
	   The exhibition match, played on what would have been the fourth
day of the abandoned first cricket test, was the first outing for
both teams after they had been confined indoors due to continuing
rain that robbed the first game of the three-test series.
	   A New Zealand XI batting first hammered 304 for six in 50 overs
and an Indian XI replied with 238 for eight to lose by 66 runs.
	   The only encouraging sign for the visitors was the form of
Venkat Laxman, who stroked a fine 82.
	   Laxman, who will open if vice-captain Ajey Jadeja (sprained
ankle) fails to recover in time for the second test, batted for 33
overs before falling to a catch on mid-wicket boundary.
	   After Matt Bell and Matt Horne (64) had launched a an early
attack on the new-ball pair of Javagal Srinath and Venkatesh
Prasad, Fleming, 73 off 64 balls and McMillan (46) hammered a
run-a-ball 95 runs for the fourth wicket.
	   After opener Navjot Sidhu (10) had fallen cheaply, Laxman and
Rahul Dravid (51) figured in a 112-run stand before India lost its
way.
	   Scores: New Zealand XI 304 for six (Matt Horne 64, Stephen
Fleming 73) beat Indian XI 238 for eight (Venkat Laxman 82, Rahul
Dravid 51) by 66 runs.

Airport workers call off strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Airport workers called off a strike due to
begin Monday, out of ``respect for the traveling public,'' the
civil aviation union said.
	   A series of four-hour work stoppages had been planned from
Monday to Wednesday and would have seriously disrupted
pre-Christmas travel.
	   ``In a show of respect for the traveling public and in order to
avoid causing problems, (the union) is postponing its strikes
during the holiday period,'' the union said.
	   The walk-out would have caused numerous flight delays and
cancellations of both domestic and international flights.
	   The 2,700-strong civil aviation union, which includes airport
maintenance and ground crews, was demanding the immediate hiring of
staff to cover increased demands at smaller, regional airports.
	   Greece has been plagued with a series of strikes and protests by
both public and private sector employees in recent months.
	   Workers have been protesting the government's fiscal austerity
program designed to ensure Greece qualifies to join the European
Union's single currency by 2001.
	   Parliament was scheduled to vote late Monday or early Tuesday on
the 1999 state budget, which is expected to meet the targets for
participation in the single currency.

percent from January through November 1998 as compared to the same
period last year, the government said Monday.

months of 1998, but the trend has sharply reversed due to the

Philippine navy holds 11 foreigners for illegal entry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine navy has detained 11
foreigners who illegally entered the Philippines aboard a boat
laden with smuggled canned goods from Indonesia, officials said
Monday.
	   Military officials said 36 Filipinos were also aboard the motor
boat Santos Sa, which was sighted by a navy patrol vessel Sunday
off Glan town in southern Sarangani province. The boat came from
Manado, Indonesia.
	   Navy authorities turned over the Filipinos and foreigners to
coast guard and immigration officials for questioning Monday in the
southern port city of General Santos, southern Philippine military
command spokesman Horacio Lapinid said.
	   The Filipinos, mostly illegal workers in Indonesia, were
released after questioning but authorities said they would charge
the foreigners with illegal entry so they could be deported,
Lapinid said.
	   The names of the foreigners, consisting of an American, two
Britons, three Indonesians, a Swiss, two Germans and two Dutch
nationals, were not immediately available. Lapinid said the 11
carried passports but did not have clearance to enter the country.
	   The military said it has strengthened security and boosted
patrols in many areas to deter the possible entry of foreign Muslim
extremists, who might attempt to hit back at U.S. targets in the
Philippines as a retaliation for the U.S.-led missile strikes in
Baghdad last week.

North Korea thanks international community for food aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Hunger-stricken North Korea thanked
the United Nations and other donors Monday for continuing to help
feed its people.
	   ``We are grateful to the United Nations, international
organizations, countries and individual groups for continuously
rendering food, farming materials, medicals (medicines) and other
materials out of noble humanitarianism,'' said a spokesman for
North Korea's Flood Damage Rehabilitation Committee.
	   The remarks, carried by the North's official Korean Central News
Agency, came a week after the United Nations appealed for dlrs 376
million in aid to help feed millions of North Koreans in 1999.
	   The money would help 5.5 million of North Korea's most
vulnerable people survive next year, the United Nations said.
	   ``This appeal is an expression of the good faith of the
international community to continue with its humanitarian aid to
the DPRK (North Korea),'' the unidentified North Korean spokesman
said.
	   ``Continued humanitarian aid from the international community
will encourage the Korean people who are making every possible
effort to solve the food problem as soon as possible and put the
agricultural production on the normal level,'' he said.
	   Three years of bad weather, combined with decades of economic
mismanagement, have caused the collapse of the farming system in
the reclusive communist nation, leaving the North's 22 million
people largely dependent on foreign charity.
	   Food shortages and famine-related illnesses have killed up to
two million North Koreans over the past three years, U.S.
congressional officials said after a visit to the North earlier
this year.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The adopted brother of Malaysia's
former No. 2 leader was released on bail Monday as a court
reconsiders his conviction for having had sex with the jailed
politician.
	   Sukma Darmawan, 38, has been serving a six-month term for
allegedly allowing ex-deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim sodomize
him, a crime in this Muslim country.
	   Sukma says he was coerced by police into making a guilty plea.
His sentence ends in January.
	   While an appeals court on Saturday had denied a request for an
appeal, the federal High Court on Monday ordered that Sukma be
released on 10,000 ringgit bail (dlrs 2,632) until his case is
reviewed next month.
	   The decision could deal a blow to prosecutors in a separate
trial against Anwar, who had likely planned to use Sukma's
confession to a homosexual relationship as evidence in their case
against the former deputy premier.
	   Anwar, who faces charges of sexual misconduct and abuse power,
was ousted by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Sept. 2 and later
became the premier's biggest political rival.
	   Police arrested Anwar 18 days later in a move condemned by Anwar
and supporters as a thinly disguised effort to eliminate the prime
minister's top opponent.
	   Last week, one of Anwar's attorneys, Christopher Fernando, read
excerpts of an undated letter Sukma had written from jail shortly
after he pleaded guilty in September to allowing himself to be
sodomized by Anwar.
	   Fernando used the letter as an exhibit to support the defense
contention that police were enmeshed in a high-level conspiracy to
topple Anwar.
	   ``The police took all types of body hair from Sukma, and
conducted an anal test on him, which hurt him very much,'' said
Fernando.
	   Also serving a six-month sentence for confessing to having sex
with Anwar is the politician's former speech writer, Munawar Ahmad
Anees. He, too, has appealed his conviction, saying he was tortured
and coerced by police into pleading guilty.

Europe's banks optimistic as they brace for the euro
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With FEA-The Euro-Changers &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ While most of Europe echoes to the
sound of popping champagne corks on New Year's Eve, the incessant
clicks of computer keyboards will break the traditional holiday
silence in financial centers.
	   Thousands of bank employees will be working round the clock over
the long New Year's weekend getting ready to usher in the European
Union's new single currency. They have to make sure computer
networks, accounting rooms and trading systems are ready for the
euro when financial markets reopen Jan. 4.
	   ``We'll have the pleasure of spending New Year's Eve, and the
whole weekend, at the bank,'' said Jean-Francois Colin,
euro-project coordinator for Banque Nationale de Paris. ``There's
an enormous pile of work to get through.''
	   The banks' frantic runup to ``E-day'' will mark the culmination
of years of preparation for the unprecedented monetary switch by 11
of the EU's 15 nations.
	   Banks, more than most other businesses, will be in the vanguard
of adopting _ and adapting _ to the new currency.
	   Exchange rates at which the 11 member currencies will be
absorbed into the euro will be fixed at European Union headquarters
on Dec. 31, leaving the banks just four days to adapt software
programs to convert stock shares, bonds, deposits and loans into
euros before markets open the following Monday.
	   The European Bankers Federation estimates the switchover will
cost the sector almost dlrs 10 billion.
	   Some euro-troubles await.
	   Foreign exchange trading in the 11 currencies joining the euro _
long a lucrative business _ will end Dec. 31. Banks that long have
had a cushy business in their home markets will face competition
from rivals in neighboring countries. Bond issues denominated in
local currencies will disappear.
	   ``To be a strong European bank now you have to be a strong bank
everywhere,'' said Dennis Phillips, spokesman at Commerzbank in
Frankfurt, Germany. ``There'll be much fiercer competition among
banks.''
	   Despite such worries, Europe's banks are eagerly awaiting the
euro. They see it boosting the continent's economies, which will
mean more business for banks.
	   By forging a giant currency union stretching from Portugal to
Finland, Ireland to Austria, the euro will tear down barriers to
trade, eliminate the risk of doing business in different currencies
and spawn a flurry of frontier-free business, supporters say. They
also say the union will help ensure stability in the nations'
economies and interest rates.
	   Bankers say that spells more opportunities than risks.
	   ``The euro will reshuffle the cards, and banks that have
prepared well can reap the profits,'' said Colin. ``We see the euro
as a chance to gain market share.''
	   Banks can trawl for clients in all 11 nations by offering
standardized products across the euro zone such as faster, cheaper
cross-border money transfers and loans in euros. Centralized
accounts would, for example, allow a company operating in the
Netherlands and Belgium to streamline business by paying suppliers
and employees from a single euro account.
	   Banks will be able to use savings deposited in one country to
make loans in another, without fear of currency fluctuations. Stock
and bond markets will expand.
	   Freed from the limitations of their national market base,
European banks hope the euro will allow them to build up greater
global reach, backed by a currency they expect to rival the dollar
for strength and stability.
	   Things, though, will not happen immediately.
	   Starting Jan. 1, banks will offer customers the choice of
holding savings and checking accounts denominated in euros, or
national currencies. Commerzbank, in a recent survey, found just 2
percent of its business clients were strongly interested in
switching to the euro on Day One.
	   Smaller businesses, in particular, plan to hang on to national
currencies longer into the three-year transition period before euro
notes and coins emerge to replace national currencies.
	   Consumers will be even slower adapting. Since they'll still be
doing their shopping in Italian lire, Luxembourg francs, Spanish
pesetas and the rest up to 2002, the vast majority are expected to
keep their bank accounts in their national currencies.
	   The euro is expected to lead to takeovers and alliances in the
banking sector as banks expand beyond their national borders. The
recent acquisition by Germany's Deutsche Bank of Credit Lyonnais
Belgium and the purchase of Belgium's Banque Bruxelles Lambert by
ING of the Netherlands could be just the start.
	   ``There will more mergers, of course. It will lead to the
formation of Europe-wide banking groups,'' predicted Colin of BNP,
which operates an alliance with Germany's Dresdner Bank.

Radical Muslim group threatens U.S., Kuwait after attack on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Iraq &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Egyptian radical Islamic group issued a
series of threats against the United States and Kuwait to avenge
the U.S.-British airstrikes on Iraq, a leading Arab newspaper
reported Monday.
	   The London-based daily Al-Hayat said it received a statement and
a phone call claiming to be from al-Gamaa al-Islamiya, or the
Islamic Group, which urged a holy war against the United States and
threatened to blow up Kuwaiti embassies.
	   Al-Hayat's office in the Gulf state of Bahrain also received a
phone call from a man who did not identify himself with any group
and threatened to attack American interests, including ones in
Bahrain, the paper said.
	   In Bahrain, a U.S. Embassy official said that the embassy
received a telephone bomb threat Sunday and that the building was
evacuated but no bomb was found. The embassy official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the caller did not identify himself
with any group.
	   The four days of missile and bomb attacks on Iraq came after the
chief U.N. arms inspector accused the Iraqi government of failing
to cooperate in the search for weapons of mass destruction. The
U.S.-British airstrikes also led to protests throughout the Arab
world.
	   In its Monday edition, Al-Hayat printed a statement attributed
to the Islamic Group which said that fighting Americans ``is an
order from God'' and added that without such a fight ``we cannot
get dignity and stop American arrogance.''
	   The paper said it also received a phone call Sunday from a man
speaking with an Egyptian accent who said ``the Islamic Group will
bomb eight Kuwaiti embassies around the world on Monday.''
	   Kuwait, which was invaded by Iraq in 1990, is among the few Arab
states that supported the U.S.-British action.
	   The Islamic Group carried out a six-year campaign of violence
aimed at toppling Egypt's secular government that led to more than
1,250 deaths. It's spiritual leader is Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, who
is jailed in the United States on a conviction of conspiring to
blow up New York landmarks.
	   The Islamic Group statement urged a ``jihad,'' or holy war,
against the United States, a boycott of British and American goods
and the ejection of U.S. and British ambassadors from Islamic
countries.
	   ``What is happening in Iraq should raise the (Muslim) nation ...
and push it to inflict the required punishment on the Americans and
their allies,'' the statement said.
	   Al-Hayat is one of the most well-known newspapers in the Arab
world and frequently receives communiques from Arab and Islamic
groups.
	   Two days ago, it printed a statement issued in the name of the
Egyptian group Islamic Jihad-Vanguards of Conquest also threatening
to avenge the bombardment of Iraq by punishing the United States.

Euro to simplify changing money for millions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With FEA-The Euro-Banks &QL; 
 &UR; By DEBORAH SEWARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Laura Llado can't wait for Europe's new single
currency. It will eliminate the hodgepodge of money and exchange
rates that confound travelers on the continent.
	   ``Now, you have to change every time you go to another
country,'' said Llado, a businesswoman from Puerto Rico. With the
euro, ``you will change once and can go everywhere. You won't have
to think about it.''
	   Actual euro coins and bills don't go into circulation for three
more years. But on Jan. 1, the currencies of the 11 participating
countries will be fixed against the euro.
	   This giant step is shaking up _ and is likely to shake out _ the
money-changing business.
	   Overnight, the need to hunt for the best exchange rate from one
moneychanger to another will vanish.
	   ``There will be no more fluctuations between currencies,'' said
Nicolas Sireyjol, director of card services for American Express in
France.
	   With the rates fixed, the only way for exchange bureaus to make
a profit on changing money will be by charging fees or commissions,
and those charges must be clearly indicated on the customer's
receipt.
	   Three years from now, when the euro goes from being a virtual
currency to a real one, it will simplify the changing of money for
the 290 million residents in Austria, Belgium, Finland, France,
Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and
Spain.
	   They no longer will have to change money when they go to another
euro country. Travelers coming from outside the currency zone will
only have to change money once.
	   There will be no need to change money just to get a coin for a
baggage cart in Belgium when you arrive from Germany. Have a few
extra euros from a stay in Paris? You can use them at a vending
machine in Berlin.
	   In the short run, things will be a bit more complicated.
	   As of Jan. 1, currency values will be posted twice: against the
local currency and the euro.
	   A traveler who wants to change Spanish pesetas into French
francs, for instance, will see the value of both currencies in
relation to the euro on the display board.
	   Once the euro is in circulation in 2002, currency exchange
bureaus will lose a lot of business _ and some are likely to go out
of business.
	   ``We will see a shrinking of the market,'' said Bill Stewart,
director for the Chequepoint exchange company. ``It's the death
knell for little back-street exchanges.''
	   He said 29 percent of his business is from European customers,
most of whom won't need the company's services in 2002.
	   Chequepoint is already diversifying. The company now sells maps,
telephone cards and guidebooks. It also offers Internet access so
travelers can check their e-mail, as well as a car rental service.
	   To survive, Stewart said, ``We have to create an image that
doesn't just say `change.'''

	   PARIS (AP) _ As owner of the bustling Nemrod cafe on Paris' Left
Bank, Michelle Bonal has received a pile of brochures over the past
year, urging small businesses like hers to start planning for the
euro.
	   ``Do you know what I have done with them?'' she asked with an
abrupt wave of her hand. ``I have dumped them all in the garbage.''
	   ``We'll just wait until the last minute and see what the other
cafes have done,'' she added, serving a coffee with one hand and
wiping the chrome counter with the other.
	   Bonal is typical of many small-business owners in France, who
see the Jan. 1 start to the European Union's common currency as
more of a giant hassle than an opportunity to forge economic unity.
	   And many, like Bonal, have ignored advice to start training
staff, modifying cash registers and preparing customers for the
upcoming changeover.
	   What's the hurry, they argue, when most of the euro zone's 290
million citizens will be able to largely ignore the new currency
until 2002?
	   After years of planning, the euro becomes the official common
currency of 11 EU nations on Jan. 1. But while the euro's value
will be set in the coming weeks, actual euro coins and notes won't
hit the cafe counters until three years later.
	   The lengthy transition phase, during which customers will be
able to make credit card or check payments in euros at certain
stores, will bring a good share of confusion for small businesses.
	   So far, even those that have taken steps to adapt have made
mostly cosmetic changes, such as printing euro equivalents on
menus.
	   The euro malaise among small-business owners contrasts with the
aggressive stance taken by some of France's larger corporations,
which have cross-border operations and millions of euros at stake.
	   Eric Reibel, international commerce adviser for the Paris
Chamber of Commerce and Industry, has organized meetings and
training seminars to help businesses prepare for the euro and has
even offered a telephone hotline.
	   ``Very few people have called,'' he said with a sigh. ``I am
concerned that the euro will come as a shock to those who are not
prepared.''
	   Companies and their customers can switch their books from
national currencies to euros any time between 1999 and 2002. Not
surprisingly, many shop owners say they will make the final change
at the last possible moment.
	   ``I'll wait to switch our accounting system until it's
absolutely necessary,'' said Lysiane Paquier, who runs the Paris
bistrot L'O a la Bouche with her chef husband.
	   In February, the French Finance Ministry printed a euro guide
advising small and medium-sized businesses to put together a plan
of action and draw up a budget for the transition.
	   Large companies have been scrambling to prepare for at least the
past year.
	   Carrefour, which operates superstores selling everything from
camembert to car batteries, appointed a team of employees a year
ago to focus exclusively on the euro. As a result, employees now
receive paystubs in francs and euros, and stores have replaced cash
registers so all will be ready to accept euro credit cards and
checks Jan. 1.
	   Most small businesses, however, say they don't see the payoff
for early planning.
	   Paquier has printed the rough euro equivalent on her menus for
the past year so diners can get used to paying around 29 euros for
a three-course meal instead of 190 francs (dlrs 34). And she's made
plans to buy a new cash register that will allow her to print bills
in euros and francs.
	   But for now, she sees few advantages to the euro. ``In the long
run, it could bring us more customers and make purchasing easier,''
Paquier said. ``But in the short term, I see no advantages _ only
headaches.''

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Brightly colored bank ads on a street
corner show pictures of a teddy bear, a pen, a piece of candy and a
camera next to the words: I am a euro.
	   Most passersby, of course, know the euro is their future
currency, and not any of the above.
	   The ads, by Dresdner Bank, are part of a broad education blitz
aimed at increasing awareness among the 290 million residents in
the 11 European Union countries that will adopt the new currency
Jan. 1.
	   Information about the euro has been trickling down since the EU
agreed on the concept of a single currency in 1992. But as the
launch nears, questions have become more urgent:
	   Must bank accounts be switched to euros starting Jan. 1? (No,
not until the bills and coins appear in 2002.) Will customers be
charged if they want accounts changed over to euros? (No.) Will
prices go up? (Maybe.) What happens on the stock exchange? (The
German mark, French franc, Italian lira and other national
currencies give way to the euro when trading opens Jan. 4, the
first business day after the switchover.)
	   ``People who are active and ask for things, they're
well-informed,'' said Georg Birgelen, a representative of the EU's
executive agency, the European Commission.
	   ``The problem is those who are fringe groups _ those who don't
read the newspapers, for example. For them, we still have a lot of
work to do.''
	   Financial institutions and banks, the most directly affected by
the launch, are taking the lead in informing the public _ their
customers _ about what to expect, and when to expect it.
	   Dresdner Bank even has an information hotline number in huge
numbers running nearly half way up its 40-story headquarters in
Frankfurt.
	   Governments and industry also are pitching in with seminars,
hotlines, Web sites, brochures, information tents, mobile units and
teaching materials _ in short anything that will help users
understand the euro.
	   ``We've noticed that over the last year something has changed.
Until then the questions were always: `Is the euro coming?' `Must
it be?' Now, the `why' is irrelevant,'' said Gunter Lambertz, who
organizes euro seminars for Germany's Industry and Trade Chamber.
	   Is the message getting across?
	   ``It's working, in the sense that we have a long time to get
used to the change,'' said Giuseppe Zambon, who owns an
international book store in Frankfurt.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A key prosecution witness in the
trial against Malaysia's former No. 2 leader, Anwar Ibrahim,
testified Monday that police threatened to send her to jail if she
didn't retract a claim that her brother's wife slept with Anwar.
	   ``I was tortured mentally to force me to change my mind,'' Ummi
Hafilda Ali testified during the opening of the seventh week of a
trial that has consumed the capital city.
	   Anwar, ousted Sept. 2 as deputy prime minister and finance
minister, is on trial for 10 counts of sodomy, adultery and abuse
of power.
	   The government's case was prompted by accusations by Ummi, the
sister of Anwar's private secretary, and Azizan Abu Bakar, a former
driver for the politician's family.
	   Ummi wrote a letter to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in 1997
in which she alleged that her brother's wife had committed adultery
with Anwar. Police investigations concluded the charges were false
and Mahathir halted the investigations against his deputy.
	   Ummi told the court Monday that she was arrested Aug. 17, after
having written the letter to Mahathir. She and Azizan were grilled
for seven hours, Ummi testified.
	   ``I was interrogated roughly and was also threatened,'' she
said, adding that Deputy Superintendent of Police Aziz Husin told
her she would be held for two years under the Internal Security Act
if she did not write a retraction.
	   ``Almost every half hour, DSP Aziz Husin threatened to send me
to Jalan Travers police station together with drug addicts and
prostitutes. It frightened me at the time,'' she testified.
	   Ummi said she was constantly followed by strangers and grew
concerned for her safety and that of her family.
	   She testified that she was contacted by a police official who
told her to go to a luxury hotel. There, she was met by other
police officials who told her top officials were not pleased with
her letter of retraction.
	   They demanded she make a public apology on state-run television.
	   ``I refused because this might jeopardize my credibility as a
person with principles,'' Ummi testified, to snickers from some of
Anwar's relatives in the courtroom.
	   After refusing to make a public apology, Ummi said the police
then presented her with a letter of retraction for her to sign, one
that was more in favor of Anwar.
	   ``I finally signed it after I was forced once against by DSP
Aziz Husin,'' she told the court.
	   Still, on Monday Ummi stood by her original letter to Mahathir.
	   She wrote the letter ``to request the prime minister to save my
brother Azmin Ali from working with a person who betrayed him -- a
person with low morals called Anwar Ibrahim.''
	   Ummi said she called on the prime minister to investigate her
sex charges and asked for police protection.
	   Anwar has denied all the accusations against him, saying they
were cooked up to eliminate his challenge to Mahathir's
17-year-rule. The ousted politician, whose wife has formed a
political reform party on his behalf, claims a high-level
government conspiracy is out to ruin his career.
	   Meanwhile, Anwar's adopted brother, Sukma Darmawan, 38, was
released on bail Monday until a federal court can review his
conviction.
	   Sukma pleaded guilty to allowing Anwar to sodomize him and was
sentenced to six months in prison. He has since appealed his
conviction, saying he made it under duress after being physically
abused by police.
	   The High Court ordered him released on 10,000 ringgit (dlrs
2,632) bail until his scheduled appeal on Jan. 4.
	   If Sukma wins his appeal, it could deal a blow to the
prosecution as his conviction was to be a key piece of evidence
against Anwar.

French Foreign Minister calls for changes in UNSCOM
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine on Monday
said that the international community needed to put in place a
system of continuous control over Iraqi weapons.
	   Vedrine also said in an interview with RTL radio that a weapons
control program should be carried out by a modified version of
UNSCOM, the U.N. weapons inspection commission.
	   The French Foreign Minister also repeated his country's
long-standing call for a lifting of sanctions imposed against Iraq
as a result of the Gulf War.
	   ``We believe we should go toward a lifting of the embargo,''
Vedrine said. He added that removing the sanctions should take
place only once a system to inspect Iraq's weapons was in place.
	   ``The embargo aggravates the adversity'' of the civilian
population, Vedrine said.
	   Vedrine said the U.S. and British airstrikes had created a new
situation, but that there were not significant differences between
France and its international partners on ways to deal with Iraq.
	   France has been critical of the airstrikes, arguing they won't
resolve the crisis with Iraq.

Dam break spills waste into Russian river
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A dam broke at a water purification plant in
northern Russia, spilling industrial waste into a river that
provides drinking water to a nearby town, a news report said
Monday.
	   The dam, part of a purification plant at a paper factory, broke
in two places Sunday night, sending 1 million cubic meters (35
million cubic feet) of industrial waste into the Syas river,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The city of Syasstroi, which gets its drinking water from the
river, was cut off from the water supply soon after the spill.
Officials from the Emergency Situations Ministry were trying to
stop the leakage and clean up the waste, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Industrial waste dumping was widespread under the Soviet Union,
and Russia continues to suffer from heavily polluted lakes and
rivers, according to environmental groups. The impoverished Russian
government lacks the money to clean up the sites.

Chinese democracy campaigners get long prison terms

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES throughout with second dissident being
sentenced, COMMENTS from other dissidents, U.S. Embassy; no pickup.
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ In stern judgments capping a sweeping crackdown
on dissidents, Chinese courts sentenced two prominent democracy
campaigners to 13 and 11 years in prison Monday for trying to
organize an opposition political party.
	   The 13-year prison term given to Xu Wenli after a 3 1/2-hour
trial in Beijing was the longest sentence given to a Chinese
dissident in three years. His colleague in the China Democracy
Party, Wang Youcai, was sentenced to 11 years in a verdict
announced by a court in Hangzhou four days after his trial.
	   Xu's conviction deprives the would-be opposition group of a
potent organizer and the fractured dissident community at large of
a strong and moderating voice.
	   Xu remained defiant during his tightly controlled trial on
subversion charges, refusing to answer questions from prosecutors
and judges and responding only to those from his lawyer, the
court-appointed attorney, Mo Shaoping, said.
	   When the court asked if he would appeal, ``Xu Wenli said he
would not appeal,'' Mo said, quoting his client as saying ``this is
political persecution.''
	   Security forces have orchestrated a concerted crackdown,
trampling China's slim legal safeguards to crush the China
Democracy Party. In three weeks, at least 32 people have been
detained or questioned and Xu, Wang and another leading member, Qin
Yongmin, have been put on trial.
	   All three were charged with trying to subvert China's Communist
Party-led system. Xu and Qin were given less than four days to
prepare their defenses. Wang and Qin faced trials last Thursday
without legal counsel after police detained or scared off potential
lawyers.
	   No verdict has been announced in Qin's case.
	   Wary of the China Democracy Party's appeal, scores of uniformed
and plainclothes police sealed off Beijing's No. 1 Intermediate
People's Court Monday for Xu's trial. Foreign reporters were kept
500 meters (yards) away from the building.
	   Xu's wife was the only friend or family member given permission
to watch the proceedings, along with an audience selected by court
officials. She was escorted from her home to the courthouse by
three plainclothes officers.
	   Police detained at least two of Xu's democracy party colleagues
and kept watch on the houses of others.
	   ``Members of the China Democracy Party will struggle to the end
for the realization of democracy,'' said Gao Hongmin, whose home
was under surveillance.
	   Gao, who helped Xu organize the party's Beijing branch, said
authorities would not be able to arrest all the party's supporters.
In just six months, the party attracted enough of a following to
try to register branches in 14 provinces and cities.
	   The U.S. government and exiled dissidents, many of whom
supported the party's efforts, denounced the sentences and called
for the dissidents' release.
	   ``We are deeply disappointed with both the guilty verdict and
the extremely harsh sentence given to Mr. Xu,'' said U.S. Embassy
spokesman Bill Palmer. ``No individual should be arrested, tried or
sentenced for exercising internationally recognized freedoms.''
	   Wang Bingzhang, who has tried to organize Chinese dissidents
abroad and at home into a separate political party, accused
Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin of acting with a ``poisonous
hand'' in convicting Xu.
	   Xu, 55, edited an underground journal in the Democracy Wall
movement 20 years ago and spent 12 years in prison, mostly in
solitary confinement. Since his parole ended last year, he has been
behind-the-scenes advisor to a host of dissident activities.
	   He supported Qin Yongmin, another Democracy Wall veteran, in
setting up an independent human rights monitor and advised others
to run for local legislative seats in Beijing. Xu became openly
involved in the China Democracy Party in November, after another
leading dissident apparently bowed out under police pressure.
	   Wang Youcai, a student leader of the Tiananmen Square democracy
demonstrations in 1989, publicly declared the China Democracy
Party's formation in June and said the group intended to challenge
the Communist Party's 49-year ban on opposition politics.
	   Although police moved sporadically to detain the democracy
party's supporters, the decisive move came Nov. 30 as Chinese
Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin returned from Japan, ending a
busy two years of diplomatic forays.
	   In a speech broadcast nationwide on Friday, Jiang warned against
subversives trying to bring down the system and vowed never to copy
Western democracy.
	   To allay international criticism, China released a respected
labor rights campaigner, Liu Nianchun, from 3 1/2 years in prison
camps on Sunday and sent him into exile in the United States.

 &UR; MEXICO: Ambassador returns to Cuba after Castro apologizes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico has sent its ambassador back to Cuba,
declaring an end to a spat over comments by Fidel Castro thought to
criticize Mexican policies.
	   Ambassador Pedro Joaquin Coldwell said on his return to Havana
on Saturday that the diplomatic row was completely over, the
official Notimex news agency reported.
	   Mexico withdrew Joaquin Coldwell on Dec. 4 after Castro,
speaking two days earlier at a meeting of Latin American leaders,
seemed to criticize Mexico's free-trade pact with the United
States, and suggested that Mexican youth knew more about Mickey
Mouse than about their national heroes.
	   It was an unprecedented, if relatively minor dispute between the
two close nations. Mexico is the only Latin American nation that
never broke ties with Cuba under U.S. pressure in the 1960s.
	   On Friday, Castro sent Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina to
Mexico City with a public letter expressing his affection for the
country.
	   Castro said in the letter that Cuban independence hero Jose
Marti ``taught us to love Mexico, the country I love and admire
more than any other.''
	   Castro wrote that if ``one single Mexican feels offended by my
words, I have no objection at all to apologizing.''
	   But he insisted that ``at no moment did the idea or plan to
offend or injure Mexico pass through my mind.''
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Independence party looks for support after referendum
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ The Puerto Rican Independence
Party, badly wounded in a recent vote on the island's relationship
with the United States, said Sunday it would try to heal its
differences with more radical groups.
	   The party's central committee approved a resolution to ``open
the channels of communication'' with other groups ``within a
framework of respect toward the diversity and integrity of each
organization.''
	   The Independence Party believes independence from the United
States can be achieved through political means. For the last two
decades, it has tried to distance itself from more militant groups
like the New Independence Movement, Common Cause for Independence,
the Nationalist Party and the Socialist Front.
	   Those groups complain that the Independence Party's longtime
leader, Ruben Berrios Martinez, is too authoritarian. Many of the
groups refuse to vote or nominate politicians, calling the current
commonwealth government a colonial regime.
	   On Sunday, Berrios warned the divisions between the factions
were deep.
	   ``After 20 years, beginning dialogue is the most we can do at
this moment,'' he said. ``As the dialogue develops, we'll see what
consequences the future will hold.''
	   Berrios' party was crippled by a Dec. 13 vote on Puerto Rico's
future in which only 2.5 percent of voters chose independence.
 &UR; GUYANA: Store owners killed as wave of crime attacks continues
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ In the latest of a wave of attacks on
business owners, police reported Sunday that robbers killed a
married couple as they locked up their general store in eastern
Guyana.
	   The killing Saturday night came three days after President Janet
government ordered troops into the streets to help police stem the
crime wave.
	   Robbers shot and killed killed Mohamed Shaheed Kassim and his
wife Dora, both believed to be in their 40s, as they were closing
their general store in Berbice County.
	   Investigators said there were few witnesses because of a
blackout at the time.
	   Four business owners have been killed and one wounded in the
last two weeks in Georgetown, the capital.
	   Police are blaming the attacks on heavily armed groups of
muggers.
	   Business leaders are warning the increase in robberies could
scare foreign businesses from Guyana, which is still trying to lure
back investors following racially charged riots earlier this year.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Famed treasure hunter dead at 76
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Mel Fisher, the treasure hunter who found his
fortune in the underwater treasures left behind by unlucky Spanish
sea captains of the 1600s and 1700s, died Saturday after a long
battle with cancer. He was 76.
	   Fisher was treated for lymphoma with months of chemotherapy, and
died at his home in Key West, said Dr. Madeleine Burnside,
executive director of the Mel Fisher Maritime Heritage Society
Treasure Museum in Key West.
	   ``He died at home in Key West at 7:30 this evening. It was
extremely peaceful,'' she said.
	   Father Tony Mullane of St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church on Big
Pine Key, who said he administered last rites to Fisher more than
three weeks ago, said family members called him Saturday evening
and told him the treasure hunter had died.
	   The Fisher family struck it rich in 1985, when son Kane found
the mother lode of the treasure of the Nuestra Senora de Atocha, a
Spanish galleon loaded with an estimated dlrs 400 million in gold,
silver and gems that went down in 1622 off Key West.
	   Fisher looked for treasure for 16 years before he found the
first traces of the Atocha site in 1971. Burnside said it turned
out the scatter field from the wreck stretched 11 miles long, and
was less than 100 feet wide.
	   Fisher had begun searching for the galleon in 1969. In the
process, he lost a son and daughter-in-law, when the boat they were
on capsized in 1975.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) - Share prices in Hong Kong closed sharply higher
Monday, boosted by cuts in local interest rates.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
rose 169.78 points, or 1.7 percent, closing at 10,396.01. On
Friday, the index had gained 142.92 points.
	   Turnover amounted to 4.171 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
534 million), little changed from Friday's 4.13 billion dollars
(U.S. dlrs 529 million).
	   Brokers said shares prices gained in reaction to Friday's cut in
local interest rates, the fourth such reduction in four months.
	   The Hong Kong Association of Banks cut their deposit interest
rate to 4.25 percent from 4.5 percent. Bank also lowered their best
lending rate 9 percent from 9.25 percent.
	   Trading was light as many investors stayed on the sidelines to
await the response of U.S. markets to the impeachment of President
Bill Clinton by the House of Representatives.
	   Among property stocks, Cheung Kong rose 1.75 Hong Kong dollars
to 57.50, and New World Development rose 60 cents to 20.20.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings rose 3.50 dollars to
197.50, and Hang Seng Bank rose 1.25 dollars to 71.75.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa rose 1.25 dollars to 56.00, and
Hong Kong Electric rose 5 cents to 23.80.

Iraqis struggle to clear rubble after U.S.-British strikes

	   BASRA, Iraq (AP) _ Perched on the edge of a 20-foot
(6-meter)-deep crater gouged out by a U.S. cruise missile, a
bulldozer tips a heap of jagged concrete blocks and twisted steel
bars into the hole. After four nights of punishing airstrikes, Iraq
is struggling to repair the damage.
	   Iraq has yet to fully assess the destruction caused by the
raids, but construction crews were quickly dispatched in hard-hit
cities such as Baghdad and Basra.
	   The United States says it will take time to assess the damage to
nearly 100 sites, including the Andalus post office in southern
Basra, where the bulldozers were at work Sunday. The post office
houses a local communications center.
	   At the complex _ a group of buildings in a residential district
_ bulldozers Sunday cleared the debris while a worker tried to
salvage white bricks from the rubble.
	   Residents said the area came under attack from U.S. missiles.
The large crater looked similar to those caused by cruise missile
blasts in Baghdad that Iraqi officials allowed reporters to visit.
	   Shaker Taher, a government worker who was standing outside a
second post office that was hit, said he was relieved the raids
were over. The government said the attacks left at least 42 people
dead.
	   ``The war stopped. That is exactly what the Iraqi people
wanted,'' Taher said. ``I hope the situation will be better then
before.''
	   The United States, however, has warned that it is prepared to
use force again if President Saddam Hussein tries to redeploy
long-range missiles or revive his chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons programs.
	   The crushing U.N. economic sanctions, imposed to punish Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein for his 1990 invasion of Kuwait, also remain
and there is little hope they will be removed anytime soon.
	   The Baghdad regime said Saturday it will not allow U.N. weapons
inspectors to return to Iraq. The inspectors must certify that Iraq
has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction before the trade and
oil sanctions can be lifted.
	   For Moueid Salah, a 51-year-old school principal in Basra, some
350 miles (560 kilometers) south of Baghdad, the most immediate
concern Sunday was the recovery of his two children, Rena, 20, and
Ali, 16 who were lightly injured in an attack.
	   They were in their bedrooms at 1:30 a.m. Thursday when a cruise
missile slammed into the ground between their house and a third
post office that was attacked in Basra. Government officials said
two paramilitary guards were killed in the strikes.
	   ``After the explosion ... I heard them yelling and I pulled them
out of the rubble,'' Salah said.
	   The two were rushed to a hospital with light injuries, treated
and released.
	   On Sunday, a 30-foot (9-meter) crater was still visible behind
the post office. The roof of the back room of Salah's yellow brick
home was a pile of rubble and the walls of the back room had
buckled.
	   The post office building also was shattered. Yellow insulation
was visible through gaping holes in the plasterboard walls.
Electricity and telephone poles near the office were twisted and
stripped of their wires.
	   Iraq has accused the United States and Britain of targeting
communications centers in an attempt to cut off the largely Shiite
Muslim south from the predominately Sunni Muslim north. Shiite
Muslims in the south rose up against the government following the
1991 Gulf War. The rebellion was crushed by Saddam's troops.
	   Iraqi officials said the oil refinery in Basra, a city bristling
with anti-aircraft guns, was also attacked but could be repaired.
U.S. officials charged that Iraq was using southern refineries and
ports in a smuggling operation to circumvent the U.N. sanctions.
	   Iraqi officials would not allow reporters to visit the refinery
Sunday.
	   About all Salah could do Sunday to start repairing his house was
to join relatives in hammering pieces of broken wood over the holes
in the blue front door.
	   ``God will punish (President Bill) Clinton'' for this, he said.

Hong Kong experiences first deflation in 23 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong has registered deflation for the
first time in 23 years, the government reported Monday, raising
fears that the territory's recession-mired economy will not rebound
for quite some time.
	   The composite consumer price index fell by 0.7 percent in
November compared with the same month in 1997, the Census and
Statistics Department said. The index edged up by only 0.1 percent
year-on-year in October.
	   For the first 11 months of this year, the pricing index was up
3.2 percent compared with the same period last year.
	   A government statement said ``the slack overall economic
conditions'' contributed to the slump in prices last month.
	   It cited a freeze in government fees and charges, lower costs
for clothing, housing and food and low inflation rates in other
economies as factors pushing down the inflation rate in Hong Kong.
	   Economists said the deflationary number was in line with
expectations.
	   Stanley Ng, head of research at Mansion House Securities (Far
East) Ltd., said he doesn't expect any rise in consumer prices
anytime soon, noting that domestic demand remains muted.
	   Shamus Mok, chief economist at Bank of East Asia Ltd., said the
latest figures indicate Hong Kong still is a long way from a
recovery.
	   ``It means our economy is still adjusting downward,'' he said.
He predicted that fourth quarter gross domestic product would
shrink 5 percent.
	   The territory could see the deflationary trend continue much of
next year, particularly because residential rental costs are
falling, Mok said.
	   Hong Kong's economy contracted by 7 percent in the third quarter
of 1998, and is expected to shrink by 5 percent for the whole year.

Russian defense minister calls ex-Soviet republics to work
</HEADLINE>
together &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's defense minister said Monday that the
former Soviet republics should cooperate more closely to deal with
common political and military challenges, a news report said.
	   Igor Sergeyev cited the ``unpredictable'' policies of United
States _ a reference to recent American air strikes against Iraq _
as a reason for greater unity among the ex-Soviet republics.
	   Russia was a staunch opponent of the attacks against Iraq.
	   Sergeyev made his remarks as he opened a meeting of defense
ministers from the Commonwealth of Independent States, a grouping
of 12 former republics.
	   The countries already work together on some military issues, and
Russian troops are currently in three former republics where they
help maintain the peace _ Moldova, Georgia, and Tajikistan.
	   Sergeyev noted that the 12 nations have signed some 270
defense-related agreements since the commonwealth was formed in the
wake of the 1991 Soviet breakup.
	   However, the countries also have differences. Some have been
active participants in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, such
as Ukraine.
	   Meanwhile, Russia and Belarus are adamantly opposed to NATO's
moves to expand into eastern Europe.
	   All of the commonwealth nations have struggling economies and
military leaders regularly complain about funding shortages.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The European Union announced Monday
that it will provide financial aid to Southeast Asian nations to
strengthen the enforcement of local laws protecting intellectual
property.
	   The EU said in a statement that the 5 million euro (dlrs 5.5
million) program, a joint project with Thailand, will provide
training for police, customs and justice authorities in the region
to meet World Trade Organization standards on property rights.
	   The five-year program will include technology transfers to
upgrade the enforcement system in line with EU standards.

Chinese repatriate dozens of North Korean refugees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police in northeastern China's Jilin province
said Monday they had rounded up at least 100 North Koreans and sent
them back to endure a famine in their reclusive country.
	   A police official in the Jilin city of Tonghua, near the North
Korean border, said the North Koreans were forced to repatriate
because some had resettled illegally in China, had formed criminal
gangs or engaged in prostitution.
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, denied
reports in the South Korean press that the Chinese had disregarded
requests for political asylum in forcing the refugees back across
the border.
	   He said they had crossed into China seeking food, not because of
political repression in North Korea.
	   Citing a North Korean human rights group and Japanese tourists
visiting the region, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported
Monday that 150 North Koreans had been sent home from China,
despite having presented petitions for political asylum.
	   North Korea is entering its fourth winter of chronic food
shortages, having harvested only 3 million tons of grain this year,
about two-thirds of the minimum needed by its 23 million people.

Radical Muslim group threatens U.S., Kuwait after attack on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Iraq &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Egyptian radical Islamic group issued a
series of threats against the United States and Kuwait to avenge
the U.S.-British airstrikes on Iraq, a leading Arab newspaper
reported Monday.
	   The London-based daily Al-Hayat said it received a statement and
a phone call claiming to be from al-Gamaa al-Islamiya, or the
Islamic Group, which urged a holy war against the United States and
threatened to blow up Kuwaiti embassies.
	   Al-Hayat's office in the Gulf state of Bahrain also received a
phone call from a man who did not identify himself with any group
and threatened to attack American interests, including ones in
Bahrain, the newspaper said.
	   In Bahrain, a U.S. Embassy official said the embassy received a
telephone bomb threat Sunday and that the building was evacuated,
but no bomb was found. The embassy official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said the caller did not identify himself with any
group.
	   The four days of missile and bomb attacks on Iraq came after the
chief U.N. arms inspector accused the Iraqi government of failing
to cooperate in the search for weapons of mass destruction. The
U.S.-British airstrikes also led to protests throughout the Arab
world.
	   In its Monday edition, Al-Hayat printed a statement attributed
to the Islamic Group which said that fighting Americans ``is an
order from God'' and added that without such a fight ``we cannot
get dignity and stop American arrogance.''
	   The newspaper said it also received a phone call Sunday from a
man speaking with an Egyptian accent who said ``the Islamic Group
will bomb eight Kuwaiti embassies around the world on Monday.''
	   Kuwait, which was invaded by Iraq in 1990, is among the few Arab
states that supported the U.S.-British action.
	   The Islamic Group carried out a six-year campaign of violence
aimed at toppling Egypt's secular government that led to more than
1,250 deaths. Its spiritual leader is Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, who
is jailed in the United States on a conviction of conspiring to
blow up New York landmarks.
	   The Islamic Group statement urged a ``jihad,'' or holy war,
against the United States, a boycott of British and American goods
and the ejection of U.S. and British ambassadors from Islamic
countries.
	   ``What is happening in Iraq should raise the (Muslim) nation ...
and push it to inflict the required punishment on the Americans and
their allies,'' the statement said.
	   Al-Hayat is one of the most well-known newspapers in the Arab
world and frequently receives communiques from Arab and Islamic
groups.
	   Two days ago, it printed a statement issued in the name of the
Egyptian group Islamic Jihad-Vanguards of Conquest also threatening
to avenge the bombardment of Iraq by punishing the United States.

Municipal elections end, presidential candidate wins mayor's post
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ The four parties of Slovakia's
coalition government won six out of eight mayoral posts in the
country's largest cities in municipal elections last week, local
media reported Monday.
	   Government candidate and former prime minister Jozef Moravcik
was elected mayor of the Slovak capital Bratislava, according to
initial unofficial results released in papers Monday. Rudolf
Schuster, who the government is also supporting in presidential
elections next year, was reelected mayor of the country's second
largest city, Kosice.
	   Three top representatives of the nationalistic Slovak National
Party, including the party chairman and vice-chairman, also won
mayoral posts. Party chairman Jan Slota, the new mayor of Zilina,
is well-known for his anti-minority orientation.
	   The Dec. 18-19 municipal elections were held with no major
problems or disturbances, the Central Election Commission said
Monday.
	   Official final results are to be announced on Tuesday.

Ugandan army denies involvement in Angolan civil war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The Ugandan army has denied reports it is
aiding UNITA rebels fighting Angolan government troops, the
government-owned New Vision newspaper said Monday.
	   ``We have no links with UNITA. We see it as another way by
Angola of diverting attention from its increasing internal woes in
face of battlefield losses in the Democratic Republic of Congo,'' a
military source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Uganda's
largest newspaper.
	   Following the outbreak in August of a rebellion against
Congolese President Laurent Kabila, Angola intervened on the
government side with troops and equipment.
	   But there have been reports that it recently withdrew a
battalion from the Congo when serious fighting broke out in central
Angola around the town of Cuito between government troops and UNITA
forces.
	   Angola and UNITA, the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola, signed a peace agreement in 1994.
	   Recent news reports have quoted an Angolan military source as
claiming that UNITA fighters have been seen wearing Ugandan and
Rwandan army uniforms.
	   In 1997, Angolan troops joined Congolese rebels backed by Rwanda
and Uganda to oust the longtime head of the former Zaire, Mobutu
Sese Seko, and put Kabila in power.
	   At that time, Angola was seeking to deprive UNITA of bases in
what was then southwestern Zaire.
	   Uganda and Rwanda are supporting the current rebellion in what
is now Congo because Kabila has allowed rebels acting against them
to set up bases in eastern Congo.
	   ``Our army is in eastern Congo for strategic reasons,'' the
newspaper quoted the Ugandan military source as saying. ``How could
a government with no control of half its territory (Angola), chose
to intervene in Congo?''

Report: Malaysia asks Japan for dlrs 5 billion loan under `Miyazawa
</HEADLINE>
Plan'

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia has asked Japan for a
dlrs 5 billion share of Tokyo's dlrs 30 billion recovery package
earmarked for struggling Asian economies, a news report said
Monday.
	   Malaysia's Second Finance Minister Mustapa Mohamad said that if
Malaysia received the money, it would be sufficient to finance his
nation's 1999 budget deficit, the state-run Bernama news agency
reported.
	   Recession has taken its toll on Malaysia's economy. The
inflation rate has risen, industrial production has fallen 10.4
percent and the overall economy shrank 8.6 percent in the third
quarter, a dramatic slowdown from a 7.8 percent growth rate in
1997.
	   Bernama quoted Mustapa as saying Malaysia's Economic Planning
Unit was ``putting out a request for about dlrs 5 billion from the
Miyazawa Plan,'' referring to the stimulus package named after
Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, who unveiled the fund in
October.
	   ``Japan is serious with Malaysia's loan application and we hope
that the deal would be finalized soon,'' Mustapa was quoted as
saying.
	   Malaysia's announcement comes just a few days after Japan's
ambassador to Malaysia outlined a separate dlrs 2 billion financial
aid program for the recession-hit Southeast Asian nation.
	   Ambassador Issei Nomura also said that the Japanese government
was still considering Malaysia's application for a yen loan under
the Miyazawa plan.
	   The dlrs 30 billion package is to be shared by the hardest-hit
East Asian economies _ Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines,
Malaysia and South Korea.
	   Nomura had said there was no fixed allocation for Malaysia and
the maximum amount available was about dlrs 5 billion.

German Catholic church assails abortion pill plans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The head of Germany's Roman Catholic Church
assailed the government Monday for planning to allow sales of the
RU-486 abortion pill.
	   ``Playing down abortion by portraying this drug as a more gentle
method is unacceptable,'' Karl Lehmann, head of the German bishops'
conference, said on German radio. ``It remains an illegal
killing.''
	   Former chancellor Helmut Kohl, a Christian Democrat, blocked
sales of the pill for years, but the center-left government that
emerged from September elections promised a change of course.
	   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder appeared to clear the way last week
by saying he welcomes giving women an alternative to surgical
abortion.
	   Edouard Sakiz, the patent holder, said after Schroeder's
endorsement he would apply to European Union authorities next month
for approval to market the pill in Germany.
	   The German minister for women's affairs, Christine Bergmann, on
Monday rejected calls for talks with the church. ``I really don't
know what there is to talk about,'' she said.
	   The abortion pill was first marketed in France in 1988. In
Europe, only Sweden and Britain have also allowed its sale so far.
The pill causes an abortion if taken within the first 49 days of
pregnancy.
	   The German company Hoechst originally owned the RU-486 patent
through its French subsidiary Roussel Uclaf and considered
marketing the drug in Germany. But the company said at the time it
would do so only with the backing of Kohl's government, which
withheld support.
	   Under pressure from anti-abortion groups, the company
transferred the patent in April 1997 to Sakiz, one of the drug's
developers.
	   Sakiz produces the drug with a small company in France whose
name he keeps secret, fearing reprisals from abortion opponents.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ For nearly eight years, the metal gate outside the
al-Rasheed family home has been left unlocked.
	   ``I don't want him to return and find it closed,'' sobbed the
mother of musician Abdullah al-Rasheed, who left to buy bread for
his wife and six children on Jan. 3, 1991, during the seven-month
Iraqi occupation. He didn't return.
	   The symbolic hope of the open gate is in sharp contrast to the
family's cheerless reality: no answers and the tearful prospect
they may never learn his fate.
	   There are hundreds of similar stories around Kuwait, where the
government claims 605 people were detained or captured by Iraqis
and never accounted for after the 1991 Gulf War. Resolving the
cases is one point in the U.N. resolutions that ended the conflict.
But Western leaders, constantly wrangling with Saddam Hussein over
weapons inspections, rarely publicly press the issue of the MIAs.
	   It's generally been left to the Kuwaiti government and a
coalition of families to carry on the wrenching quest of seeking
those who never came home. Some were soldiers in the U.S.-led
coalition, said Kuwait's National Committee for the Missing and
POWs. Others were believed to be with the underground resistance
during the occupation.
	   ``I truly don't know why they took my son,'' said al-Rasheed's
mother, Naima Hassan Al-Salem, who last heard from freed Kuwaitis
in 1991 that her son was held in a southern Iraq jail. ``I can only
say that, God willing, someday he will walk through those gates and
come home. Maybe that will happen if Saddam ever falls.''
	   The Iraqi government, 7th graf pvs.

Two Cambodian human rights workers arrested in connection with

riots

<TEXT>
	   SIHANOUKVILLE, Cambodia (AP) _ Two human rights workers were
arrested by Cambodian police Monday as a frenzy continued over the
dumping of suspected toxic waste from Taiwan.
	   A day after a deputy governor's home and vehicle were wrecked by
a mob, about 60 demonstrators marched on the administrative offices
of the district where 3,000 tons of waste was quietly deposited
about two weeks ago without public warning.
	   Police said the march ended peacefully, but two employees
involved with it from the human rights group Licadho were detained
for allegedly inciting protesters Sunday ``to enter private
property.''
	   A Licadho official in Phnom Penh, the capital, said the two had
been monitoring the protests but emphatically denied their
involvement.
	   ``They certainly were not participating, nor were they leaders
or organizers of the riots,'' Eva Galabru said. ``It's probably the
fruit of a misunderstanding.''
	   Since the dump was found by Environment Ministry investigators a
week ago about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from seaport town of
Sihanoukville, tensions have steadily risen amid speculation the
waste may be toxic.
	   A boiling point was reached after the mysterious death of a port
worker, who was said to have cleaned the hold of the ship that
brought the waste from Taiwan.
	   Although doctors have not established a clear link between the
waste and his death, protesters took to the streets Saturday and
threw rocks at a goods-inspection office at the port.
	   Violence continued Sunday as demonstrators ransacked a hotel
they believed was owned by the inspection company. Police later
fired assault rifles over the heads of the mob and dispersed it
after the home and an off-road vehicle of Deputy Governor Khim Bo
were trashed.
	   In interviews with Cambodian media, Environment Minister Mok
Mareth has blamed an unnamed government official and port
authorities for allowing the waste to enter the country illegally.
	   The Taiwanese company that sent the waste has said it obtained
permits from Taiwanese and Cambodian authorities to export it.
	   The company, Formosa Plastics Corp., has denied the material is
toxic but admitted it does contain trace amounts of mercury, which
is highly poisonous in large doses.
	   Residents living near the dump have complained that they have
suffered from exhaustion and diarrhea after rummaging through the
waste.
	   Several port officials have been suspended from work while a
government investigation continues into the incident. Prime
Minister Hun Sen has vowed to punish anyone found responsible.
	   Hun Sen has also insisted that the waste be returned to Taiwan,
which has so far refused to take it back.
	   Bulldozers pushed mounds of earth around the dump site Sunday.
Environment officials said they would cover the waste with plastic
tarpaulins to contain any toxic substances until the material can
be removed.
	   Mok Mareth said Monday that protective suits are being purchased
abroad for workers who will eventually shovel the waste into oil
drums and load them into shipping containers at the port.

Saddam hails Iraqis for standing firm against enemies

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Baghdad renewed its claim of victory on
Monday, and extremist Muslim groups threatened retaliation for the
four days of U.S.-British airstrikes against Iraq.
	   Meanwhile, U.N. officials said humanitarian workers would return
to the Iraqi capital on Tuesday to resume supervision of food aid.
The workers were evacuated last week to the Jordanian capital Amman
amid the bombardment.
	   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, in his first public comments
since the attacks ended late Saturday, said Iraq was victorious
against ``enemies of God.''
	   In a brief speech Sunday on radio and television, Saddam said
that the Iraqi people and the army have proved to be ``worthy of
what your leadership expected from you.''
	   ``God will repay well and crown your heart with clear victory,''
he said.
	   No final casualty toll has been released, but previous reports
indicated at least 42 Iraqis were killed and 96 wounded in the
strikes, which unleashed the most severe firepower since the 1991
Gulf War. Iraqi forces offered little resistance, other than
anti-aircraft fire.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, claimed Sunday the toll
was much higher.
	   ``Casualties are in the thousands in terms of people killed or
wounded, but we don't have any final figure,'' he told CNN. ``There
has been enormous damage mainly to the civilian infrastructure and
to human lives.''
	   In halting the strikes, President Bill Clinton said the 70-hour
assault severely damaged Iraq's ability to build weapons of mass
destruction.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Sunday the United
States might strike again if Saddam rebuilds his weapons of mass
destruction.
	   ``We reserve the right to use force again,'' Albright said on
NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
	   Iraqi officials have not allowed reporters to inspect areas
where the most extensive damage occurred, including presidential
palaces and defense installations.
	   U.N. officials said that more than 100 U.N. aid workers would
leave Amman early Tuesday for Baghdad.
	   A statement issued by U.N. spokesman John Mills in New York said
oil monitors from the Dutch company Saybolt have remained on duty
and that teams from the British firm Lloyds Register had been asked
to return immediately to certify incoming food shipments.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A club for American expatriates in Singapore
was evacuated and the U.S. Embassy was searched on Monday after a
bomb threat, an embassy spokesman said. No bombs were found in
either location.
	   The embassy received a non-specific threat against Americans by
phone from an unidentified caller around noon, said the embassy
spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Singapore authorities were notified immediately and a search of
the embassy was conducted, the spokesman said. No bombs were found
and the embassy was declared safe at 1:15 p.m., whereupon it
resumed normal operations, he said.
	   Local police said in a statement that the bomb threat appeared
to be a hoax. Under Singapore law, false bomb threats are
punishable by up to seven years jail and a 50,000 Singapore dollar
(dlrs 30,300) fine.
	   Security personnel at the American Club, a centrally-located
private facility catering to U.S. citizens but also open to locals,
said about 300 members, guests and employees were evacuated shortly
after noon and the club was subsequently closed for the day.
	   Police conducted a search but found no bomb, they said, adding
that the club would reopen Tuesday as regularly scheduled.
	   Security guards carrying metal detectors continued to turn away
members arriving to at the club in the afternoon and early evening
on Monday.
	   The embassy spokesman declined to comment on whether the bomb
threat was connected with the recent U.S. military strikes against
Iraq.
	   U.S. Embassies around the world have heightened their security
since the bombing started last week amid concern over possible
retaliatory attacks.

	   The move came more than four years after the British and Irish
governments first called for outlawed armed groups to start
disarming as a sign that their cease-fires and commitment to peace
negotiations were genuine.
	   April's peace accord envisioned that armed groups supportive of
the accord _ the Irish Republican Army on the Catholic side, and
the Ulster Defense Association and Ulster Volunteer Force on the
Protestant side _ would be first to disarm. But those groups have
all balked.
	   Since their foundation in 1996, the Loyalist Volunteers had
dedicated themselves to wrecking the truce being observed by the
UDA and UVF. They killed more than a dozen Catholics at random, and
opposed the agreement on the grounds it conceded too much to IRA
supporters.
	   Then they called a surprise cease-fire in May, and in recent
months had said they would start disarming if the IRA reciprocated
the gesture.
	   In a brief statement, a Loyalist Volunteer Force spokesman said
the group expected the IRA to hand in ten times as much weaponry in
coming weeks, otherwise the LVF would not repeat its gesture.
	   The IRA and its allied Sinn Fein party dismissed in advance any
disarmament by the Loyalist Volunteers as a cynical stunt that
wouldn't influence their policy.

Asian bourses close mixed

	   HONG KONG (AP) - Asian stock markets closed mixed Monday, with
share prices slipping in Tokyo but surging in Seoul. Meanwhile, the
U.S. dollar fell against the Japanese yen on concerns over the
impeachment of U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   On the Seoul Stock Exchange, the key index surged 7.7 percent on
expectations for an upgrade in the country's debt rating early next
year.
	   The hope for an improved rating was sparked by Moody's Investors
Service's announcement last week that South Korea's foreign
exchange reserves have risen to a level necessary for the repayment
of emergency loans acquired during the height of the financial
crisis in 1997.
	   The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 40.42 points to
565.27.
	   In Tokyo, share prices fell following the dollar's drop and
concerns about rising interest rates as the Japanese government
moves to issue more bonds to help pay for a record budget deficit.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average ended three
straight sessions of gains with a drop of 41.34 points, or 0.29
percent, to close at 14,152.95. On Friday, the average closed up
67.30 points, or 0.48 percent.
	   The dollar was quoted at 114.90 yen in late afternoon trading,
down 0.30 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also below its late New
York level of 115.61 yen on Friday.
	   The dollar fell because while there is doubt the U.S. Senate
will impeach Clinton, a prolonged trial could absorb Washington's
attention and undermine its ability to manage the U.S. and world
economies, traders said.
	   Share prices in Hong Kong closed sharply higher, boosted by cuts
in local interest rates.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of
blue chips, rose 169.78 points, or 1.7 percent, closing at
10,396.01. On Friday, the index had gained 142.92 points.
	   Brokers said shares prices gained in reaction to Friday's cut in
local interest rates, the fourth such reduction in four months.
	   The Hong Kong Association of Banks cut their deposit interest
rate to 4.25 percent from 4.5 percent. Banks also lowered their
lending rate for favored clients to 9 percent from 9.25 percent.
	   Trading was light as many investors stayed on the sidelines to
await the response of U.S. markets to the impeachment of Clinton.
	   Elsewhere:
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed higher as the government's stock
stabilization fund propped up the beleaguered bourse after recent
sharp declines. The market's key Weighted Stock Price Index rose
80.17 points, or 1.2 percent, to 6,558.28.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher, with the key
index rising to its highest level in 20 weeks because of a hefty
gain by market heavyweight Telecom Corp. of New Zealand Ltd. The
benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 39.92 points, or 2 percent, to
2,062.00.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed lower as investors lightened
their holdings on concerns over the impeachment proceedings against
U.S. President Clinton and the Gulf crisis. The 30-share Philippine
Stock Exchange Index fell 13.21 points, or 0.7 percent, to
1,873.15.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed lower after a flat
performance from the banking sector, and a near 2 percent fall in
gold stocks. The All Ordinaries Index fell 11.3 points, or 0.4
percent, to 2,738.0.
	   SINGAPORE: Share prices closed slightly lower. The Straits Times
Index fell 8.23 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,397.73.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed mostly lower, but
the key index edged up because of the rise in several blue-chip
stocks. The Composite Index rose 0.43 point to 550.84.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed mixed in thin trading. The
Composite Index rose 0.541 point to 404.503.
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed lower in thin trading. The
Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index fell 4.75 points, or 1.4
percent, to 337.17.

Police detain 1,000 illegal aliens in countrywide swoop
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Police have detained at least 1,000
suspected illegal aliens since a countrywide crackdown began in
November, a police spokesman said Monday.
	   King'ori Mwangi said the latest swoop Saturday at a Nairobi
shopping center netted more than 40 people.
	   ``We are rounding up all aliens without proper documents to be
in the country,'' Mwangi said.
	   Members of Kenya's Indian community _ known locally as Asians _
claim the police action is only targeting Asians in order to extort
money from them.
	   ``We are not specifically targeting Asians in this case. We knew
where they (the illegal aliens) were,'' Mwangi said. ``We have
arrested people of all races _ black, European and Asian,'' he
said.
	   Since 1994 between 40,000 and 50,000 unskilled or semi-skilled
workers from the Indian region of Gujarat and from Pakistan have
found their way into Nairobi and several towns in central Kenya,
according to the independent Daily Nation newspaper.
	   The paper said immigration records show that fewer than 1,000
work permits are issued every year while evidence on the ground
shows that dozens of people from India and Pakistan are entering
the job market every day.
	   The newspaper said criminal syndicates lure would-be immigrants
with promises of good jobs in Kenya where unemployment is estimated
to be as high as 50 percent of the working age population.
	   The syndicates reportedly bribe Kenyan immigration officials to
issue false work and residence permits.
	   Mwangi said the crackdown will go on until all illegal aliens
are netted.
	   ``If they are refugees, they should remain in the camps. If they
want to work here, there is a process, not just sneaking in,''
Mwangi said.
	   He said most of the illegal aliens have been taken to court. If
they are convicted of being in the country illegally, they must
serve their prison sentences and then be deported.
	   ``Some of these aliens are known to be drug runners,'' Mwangi
said, ``We cannot compromise our security.''

Chinese democracy campaigners get long prison terms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with comments from daughter, Chinese news
agency.
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ In stern judgments capping a decisive crackdown
on dissidents, Chinese courts sentenced two prominent democracy
campaigners to 13 and 11 years in prison Monday for trying to
organize an opposition political party.
	   The 13-year prison term given Xu Wenli after a 3 1/2-hour trial
in Beijing was the longest for a Chinese dissident in three years.
His colleague in the China Democracy Party, Wang Youcai, was
sentenced to 11 years, in a verdict announced by a court in
Hangzhou four days after his trial.
	   Xu's conviction deprives the would-be opposition group of a
potent organizer and the fractured dissident community at large of
a strong and moderating voice.
	   Xu remained defiant during his tightly controlled trial on
subversion charges. He refused to answer questions from prosecutors
and judges and responded only to those from his lawyer, the
court-appointed attorney, Mo Shaoping, said.
	   When the court asked if he would appeal, ``Xu Wenli said he
would not appeal,'' Mo said, quoting his client as saying ``this is
political persecution.''
	   Xu's daughter also criticized the verdict.
	   ``All he wanted to do was to advocate free speech and make sure
the party registers peacefully. But the government failed this
test, and now my father has to go to jail again for it,'' said
daughter Xu Jin, a graduate student at Boston University.
	   Security forces have orchestrated a concerted crackdown,
trampling China's slim legal safeguards to crush the China
Democracy Party. In three weeks, at least 32 people have been
detained or questioned and Xu, Wang and another leading member, Qin
Yongmin, have been put on trial.
	   All three were charged with trying to subvert China's Communist
Party-led system. Xu and Qin were given less than four days to
prepare their defenses. Last Thursday, Wang and Qin faced trials
without legal counsel after police detained or scared off potential
lawyers.
	   No verdict has been announced in Qin's case.
	   Judges in Beijing and Hangzhou found that Xu and Wang plotted
subversion by founding branches of the China Democracy Party in
both cities and accepting money from abroad, the official Xinhua
News Agency said in a rare mention of dissident activities.
	   The courts ruled the two should be ``severely punished'' as
repeat offenders, Xinhua said in an indirect reference to their
previous democracy campaigning.
	   Wary of the China Democracy Party's appeal, scores of uniformed
and plainclothes police sealed off Beijing's No. 1 Intermediate
People's Court Monday for Xu's trial. Foreign reporters were kept
500 meters (yards) away from the building.
	   Xu's wife was the only friend or family member given permission
to watch the proceedings, along with an audience selected by court
officials. She was escorted from her home to the courthouse by
three plainclothes officers. Hours after the verdict, He Xintong
still had not returned home nor had she contacted her daughter.
	   Police detained at least two of Xu's democracy party colleagues
and kept watch on the houses of others.
	   ``Members of the China Democracy Party will struggle to the end
for the realization of democracy,'' said Gao Hongmin, whose home
was under surveillance.
	   Gao, who helped Xu organize the party's Beijing branch, said
authorities would not be able to arrest all the party's supporters.
In just six months, the party attracted enough of a following to
try to register branches in 14 provinces and cities.
	   The U.S. government and exiled dissidents, many of whom
supported the party's efforts, denounced the sentences and called
for the dissidents' release.
	   ``We are deeply disappointed with both the guilty verdict and
the extremely harsh sentence given to Mr. Xu,'' said U.S. Embassy
spokesman Bill Palmer. ``No individual should be arrested, tried or
sentenced for exercising internationally recognized freedoms.''
	   Xu, 55, edited an underground journal in the Democracy Wall
movement 20 years ago and spent 12 years in prison, mostly in
solitary confinement. Since his parole ended last year, he has been
behind-the-scenes advisor to a host of dissident activities.
	   He supported Qin Yongmin, another Democracy Wall veteran, in
setting up an independent human rights monitor and advised others
to run for local legislative seats in Beijing. Xu became openly
involved in the China Democracy Party in November.
	   Wang Youcai, a student leader of the Tiananmen Square democracy
demonstrations in 1989 and now 32, publicly declared the China
Democracy Party's formation in June and said the group intended to
challenge the Communist Party's 49-year ban on opposition politics.
	   Police have sporadically detained supporters of the democracy
party. The decisive move came on Nov. 30 as Chinese Communist Party
leader Jiang Zemin returned from Japan, ending a busy two years of
diplomatic forays.
	   In a speech broadcast nationwide on Friday, Jiang warned against
subversives trying to bring down the system and vowed never to copy
Western democracy.
	   To allay international criticism, China released a respected
labor rights campaigner, Liu Nianchun, from 3 1/2 years in prison
camps on Sunday and sent him into exile in the United States.

Serb policeman reported killed in northern Kosovo town
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Serb policeman shot, woman wounded,
trims.
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Serb policeman was reported killed
and a woman wounded Monday in a tense northern Kosovo town,
ushering in another week of bloodshed that threatens to plunge the
province back into all-out war.
	   The Serb-run Media Center reported 52-year-old Milic Jovic was
shot and wounded by unknown assailants using automatic weapons in
Podujevo early Monday. He died en route to the hospital. A woman
who was accompanying Jovic was wounded in the leg, the center said.
The information distributed by the Media Center cannot be
independently confirmed, but has proven reliable in the past.
	   Podujevo is overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian town some 40
kilometers (25 miles) north of Pristina, close to central Serbia.
Tensions there have grown in past weeks, as local Serbs complained
of a growing guerrilla presence and demanded a state action against
them.
	   Jovic's killing is the latest in a series of setbacks for
Kosovo's fragile truce between Serb security forces and the ethnic
Albanian separatist rebels. It is certain to enrage the Serbs,
already furious over last week's killings of six Serb youths and a
prominent Serb official.
	   The killing also came a day after the KLA buried 33 fighters who
were killed last week in a border clash with the Yugoslav army.
Some 5,000 Kosovo Albanians attended the funeral, pledging to
continue their battle against the Serb state.
	   The attack on Jovic also heightens fears that violence in Kosovo
is moving from the rugged countryside to the towns. The six youths
were killed in a bar in the western town of Pec and the official
found dead last week was deputy major Kosovo Polje, a Serb
stronghold outside Pristina.
	   The KLA has denied responsibility for the killings, but Serbian
officials and media blame the KLA.
	   The minority Serbs are to stage another rally in Kosovo Polje
Monday demanding protection against what they say is increasing
danger from the Albanians. Serbia's interior minister is expected
to address the rally.
	   The surge in tensions and incidents in Kosovo could disrupt a
shaky cease fire agreed to in October, and lead to resumption of
large-scale fighting. The previous Serb crackdown launched last
February claimed over 1,000 lives and forced some 300,000 people
from their homes.
	   Attempts at finding a peaceful solution for Kosovo have failed
so far with the two sides' positions still very much apart. Ethnic
Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the population, want
independence while Serbia refuses to give up control over its
southern province.
	   The KLA funeral Sunday was also aimed at presenting the rebels
as a formidable force. A special, elite KLA unit, dressed in black
uniforms, fired volleys of semi-automatic fire into the air in a
final salute as the simple wooden caskets were lowered into the
frozen ground on a ridge renamed ``Heroes' Graves'' about 30
kilometers (20 miles) west of Kosovo's capital Pristina.
	   ``We all together took the oath for the same cause,'' a KLA
commander, Saban Shala, said in a eulogy. ``And we promise you that
we will continue our fighting for freedom.''

Market forces drive up Nigerian fuel prices
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FRANK AIGBOGUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Fuel prices doubled overnight in Nigeria,
where motorists awoke Monday to find gasoline had shot up from 12
cents per liter to about 29 cents.
	   The sudden increase in the cost of fuel comes despite continued
assurances by Nigeria's ruling military government that gasoline
prices would not be hiked.
	   Kerosene, which is used by most Nigerians as cooking fuel,
jumped from 10 cents per liter to 27 cents. Diesel and aviation
fuel were subjected to similar increases.
	   There was no immediate explanation from the government on the
increase, but one senior administration official told The
Associated Press the change was the result of market forces.
	   ``Oil companies have been given a free hand to adjust prices
without interference,'' the official said on condition of
anonymity. ``The increase is purely on the basis of market
forces.''
	   Although Nigeria is one of world's largest oil producing
countries, it is a net importer of refined fuel. All four of
Nigeria's refineries sit idle due to disrepair.
	   Chronic fuel shortages plague Nigeria, Africa's most populous
nation, and black marketeers often fill the void with vastly
overpriced gasoline and kerosene smuggled in from neighboring
countries.
	   As part of a larger effort to alleviate the country's fuel
problems, the government has broken the state-controlled National
Petroleum Corporation's stranglehold on the domestic market.
	   Foreign and domestic oil companies can now import and distribute
refined petroleum products to meet the domestic shortfall.
	   Nigeria's military leader Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar has made it
a priority to rehabilitate the country's refining capability, which
when fully operative has a 425,000 barrel daily capacity.
	   Abubakar took control of Nigeria after the death of dictator
Gen. Sani Abacha, who died in June reportedly of a heart attack.
	   Abubakar has been working to liberalize Nigeria and hand power
over to a civilian government next year.

Saddam hails Iraqis for standing firm against enemies

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with expected return of U.N. humanitarian workers,
militant threats, Monday's editorials. No pickup &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Baghdad renewed its claim of victory on
Monday, and extremist Muslim groups threatened retaliation for the
four days of U.S.-British airstrikes against Iraq.
	   Meanwhile, U.N. officials said humanitarian workers would return
to the Iraqi capital on Tuesday to resume supervision of food aid.
The workers were evacuated last week to the neighboring Jordanian
capital Amman amid the bombardment.
	   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, in his first public comments
since the attacks ended late Saturday, said Iraq was victorious
against ``enemies of God.''
	   In a brief speech Sunday on radio and television, Saddam said
the Iraqi people and the army have proved to be ``worthy of what
your leadership expected from you.''
	   ``God will repay well and crown your heart with clear victory,''
he said.
	   No final casualty toll has been released, but previous reports
indicated at least 42 Iraqis were killed and 96 wounded in the
strikes, which unleashed the most severe firepower since the 1991
Gulf War. Iraqi forces offered little resistance other than
anti-aircraft fire.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, claimed Sunday the toll
was much higher.
	   ``Casualties are in the thousands in terms of people killed or
wounded, but we don't have any final figure,'' he told CNN. ``There
has been enormous damage mainly to the civilian infrastructure and
to human lives.''
	   In halting the strikes, President Bill Clinton said the 70-hour
assault severely damaged Iraq's ability to build weapons of mass
destruction.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Sunday that the
United States might strike again if Saddam rebuilds his weapons of
mass destruction.
	   ``We reserve the right to use force again,'' Albright said on
NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
	   Iraqi officials have not allowed reporters to inspect areas
where the most extensive damage occurred, including presidential
palaces and defense installations.
	   In New York, a statement issued by U.N. spokesman John Mills
said oil monitors from the Dutch company Saybolt have remained on
duty and that teams from the British firm Lloyds Register was asked
to return immediately to certify incoming food shipments.
	   Extremist Islamic groups, meanwhile, threatened retaliation.
	   Al-Gamaa al-Islamiya, or the Islamic Group, said in a statement
sent to the Cairo office of Al-Hayat newspaper that the attacks
were ``a disgrace to the Islamic nation,'' the paper reported
Monday.
	   The group called for a ``holy war'' against the United States
and a boycott of American and British products, the paper said. It
also called trying ``those who live in the White House as war
criminals.''
	   Anonymous calls to Al-Hayat also threatened attacks on Kuwaiti
embassies and ``American interests'' in the Gulf.
	   In Iraq's state-run newspapers, the rhetoric Monday was as
strident as before the assault and repeated the government's
assertion that it was the winner.
	   ``Victorious, as the bad bid has failed,'' said the headline in
Al-Qadissiya.
	   In his speech, Saddam also criticized the Arab world for
pretending to be ``asleep ... or sick'' and not supporting Iraq.
	   ``A new aggression (was) started by the enemies of God and the
nation. With it, the resistance started again,'' he said.
	   After calling off the attacks, Clinton said he hoped that U.N.
weapons inspectors would be able to return to Iraq to resume their
7 1/2-year mission to search and destroy illegal weapons. The
airstrikes were launched on the grounds that Iraq was obstructing
the work of the weapons inspectors of the U.N. Special Commission,
or UNSCOM.
	   But Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan declared Saturday
night that UNSCOM's ``mission is over.''
	   Baghdad was bustling with normal activity, but in the streets,
there was anger.
	   If ``Clinton has achieved his mission, why does he say the
inspectors must return?'' asked Ali Mahmoud Abdel Munaim, an
unemployed 32-year-old man. If everything illegal has been
destroyed in the airstrikes, ``the next step ought to be lifting of
sanctions,'' he said.
	   The U.N. economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait cannot be lifted until UNSCOM certifies Iraq is free of
all nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and long-range
missiles.
	   UNSCOM chief Richard Butler said it was necessary to return the
monitors to Iraq, telling Associated Press Television News that the
inspections were ``a test case in the field of nonproliferation of
weapons of mass destruction.''
	   After the strikes, many Iraqis were coming to terms with the
blows the missiles dealt to their lives.
	   Adil Mohammed Nori, a 50-year-old spice store owner, said he was
preparing to drive 185 miles (297 kilometers) to the southern town
of Ali al-Gharbi. Asked why, he said: ``To attend a funeral for a
mass destruction weapon that Clinton has destroyed: my 12-year-old
niece.''
	   He said the girl, Zehra, was killed in one of the missile
strikes.
	   The Pentagon says 425 Tomahawk cruise missiles were fired during
the campaign _ more than the number fired in the entire five-week
Gulf War to evict Iraq from Kuwait. Iraq says its gunners shot down
more than 100 Tomahawks.
	   The offensive involved 650 aircraft missions, including 32
sorties by 12 British Tornado fighter-bombers.
	   When Clinton called a halt to the attack, it apparently caught
the British by surprise. The Royal Air Force had to recall four
Tornadoes that were already en route from Kuwait to Iraq to bomb
Republican Guard positions, said Group Capt. Bryan Collins.

Balloon team denied permission to fly over China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British tycoon Richard Branson and his crew
skirted the Himalayas on Monday, but encountered a new obstacle in
their quest to circle the globe in a balloon when China abruptly
denied them permission to fly over its territory.
	   It was the second time politics threatened to derail the voyage.
Libya also unexpectedly denied permission, but backed down at the
last moment Saturday.
	   Branson and the ground crew of ICO Global, a mobile telephone
company that is supporting the trip, were scrambling to persuade
the Chinese to reverse the decision.
	   The Virgin boss, Chicago millionaire Steve Fossett and teammate
Per Lind were flying along the Himalaya mountain range Monday
morning on their way toward China.
	   The team reached the towering mountain range shortly after dawn
and were expected to fly over the top of the Himalayas, catching
sight of Everest and K2 on the way.
	   Weather conditions can deteriorate rapidly in the Himalayas,
however, and gusts of warm air from below can prove a formidable
challenge to balloonists.
	   The 270-foot (82-meter) balloon reached the Himalayas after a
quiet day Sunday crossing Turkmenistan in Central Asia and flying
over Afghanistan.
	   Over the weekend, the team had faced fierce thunderstorms and
was forced to pass through a narrow corridor in the Caucasus to
avoid flying over Iraq, Iran and Russia, which had denied the crew
the right to use their airspace.
	   Branson and Lindstrand both broke their personal duration
records of 48 hours in a hot air balloon during a 1991 crossing of
the Pacific.
	   Fossett has made four tries to ring the globe. Branson has
tried, and failed, four times to become the first person to circle
the world in a balloon.
	   Improved technology has been used to make the balloon, including
a canopy of Kevlar of the kind used for bulletproof vests that
covers the canopy over the crew's pressurized capsule.
	   The crew members, all of whom are wearing silver jumpsuits,
estimate the trip could last from eight days to nearly three weeks.
	   They hope to touch down somewhere in western Europe at the end
of a 24,000-mile (62,000 kms) flight, which will take them over
India, the South China sea, the Pacific and the United States.
	   The plan is to cross San Francisco on Christmas Day, with a goal
of reaching Europe by New Year's.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and initially had only four refusals _ Iran, Iraq, Russia and North
Korea.
	   At least three other crews have been waiting for favorable
weather to launch balloons _ from Albuquerque, New Mexico, Loves
Park, Illinois, and the Swiss Alps. Yet another team plans to take
off next month from Alice Springs, Australia.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Serb policeman was reported killed
and a woman wounded Monday in a tense northern Kosovo town,
ushering in another week of bloodshed that threatens to plunge the
Serb province back into all-out war.
	   The Serb-run Media Center reported 52-year-old Milic Jovic was

British diplomatic effort aimed at isolating Iraqi regime
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain said Monday it will seek to isolate Iraq
in the world community and and reduce any support Saddam Hussein's
regime has among Arab nations.
	   After a four-day British-U.S. air campaign against Iraq's
military installations, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said there
also will be new attempts to get humanitarian aid to the Iraqi
people directly _ and not through Saddam's regime.
	   ``It's not going to be easy,'' Cook told BBC Radio, ``because
Saddam does everything possible to obstruct and prevent it, and it
is very difficult to operate in Iraq without Saddam's agreement
given the brutality and savagery with which he represses all
opposition.''
	   Cook said Britain also wants to ensure the United Nations
monitoring of Iraq's weapons program is maintained and that
sanctions are better enforced.
	   Britain and the United States had said Iraq's refusal to
cooperate fully with the inspectors led them to attack. Iraq says
it will no longer tolerate the weapons inspections.
	   Cook said the military strikes had destroyed Saddam's ability to
jam radio programs being broadcast into Iraq from opposition groups
and news programs.
	   ``We can try now to get the truth into the Iraqi people,'' he
said.
	   The foreign secretary said he would spend Monday speaking by
telephone with European and Arab leaders to try to build support
for non-military action against Iraq.
	   ``We have had a diplomatic strategy ready for some time,'' he
said. ``You can't start that diplomatic campaign in the middle of
military campaign, but we have spelled out over the last three days
exactly what we are going to do.''
	   ``We will be seeking to build the broadest possible consensus
against Saddam and make sure he is as isolated as possible,'' he
said.
	   Eight Arab states _ including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria _
warned Baghdad last month that it would be ``held responsible for
any consequences'' of not cooperating with U.N. officials.
	   But no Arab government expressed support for the airstrikes _
which were condemned by the world's largest Muslim group, the
52-nation Organization of the Islamic Conference based in Saudi
Arabia.
	   The United States said Sunday that the airstrikes had achieved
their specific military objectives, and that U.S. policy was
shifting toward toppling Saddam.

Wages, output, trade all plummet in 1998, Russian govt. says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ More than 20 percent of all Russians received
monthly wages below the national subsistence level in the first 11
months of the year, a news report said Monday.
	   Over 35 million Russians, or 24 percent of the population, had a
monthly income below 619 rubles (dlrs 30) each month from January
through November, the Interfax news agency said, citing figures
from the State Statistics Committee.
	   The figure was up from 21 percent of the population for the same
period in 1997. Most of the change was believed linked to the
economic crisis that hit in August, which led to greater
unemployment and exacerbated the government's inability to pay
state workers.
	   Many people work second jobs and under report their income in
order to avoid taxes, but the report reflected the worsening
poverty that afflicts millions of Russians.
	   The government devalued the ruble and defaulted on some debts on
Aug. 17, causing the collapse of a number of banks and private
companies. Much of the country's middle class was wiped out, and
since then jobs have been scarce.
	   A number of other economic indicators released Monday also
pointed to worsening conditions:
	   _ Industrial output fell 5 percent from January through
November. Drops were seen most significantly in the timber,
machines and metal parts, ferrous metals and chemicals sectors.
	   _ Overall foreign trade was down 13.7 percent in the first ten
months of the year, at dlrs 112 billion.
	   _ Agricultural production dropped nine percent from January to
November. The country harvested less than half as much grain as it
did in 1997.

Japanese court rejects Korean laborers' demand for compensation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese high court upheld a lower court ruling
Monday, rejecting demands from three Koreans that a former employer
compensate them for unpaid wages and harsh treatment during the
World War II.
	   Presiding judge Sueo Kubota ruled the statute of limitations for
the Koreans' right to seek compensation from tool machinery maker
Nachi Fujikoshi Corp. has already expired, said a Kanazawa High
Court official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The plaintiffs included Choi Bok-nyon, who started work in a
Nachi Fujikoshi factory in 1943 after a company recruiter in
Japanese-occupied Korea promised her a generous salary and
educational opportunities.
	   But Choi, then 13, said she was forced to work long hours.
	   Two other plaintiffs, Lee Jong-sook, 67, and Ko tok-hwan, 76,
also said they were forced to work under strenuous conditions and
were not fully paid.
	   The three originally filed their suit with the Toyama District
court in September 1992.
	   That court ruled in 1996 that the company owed the plaintiffs
the unpaid wages, but said the firm could not be forced to pay them
because their suit was filed after the status of limitations had
expired.
	   Nachi Fujikoshi used more than 1,500 Korean forced laborers to
produce cannons and gun parts for the former Imperial Japanese Army
during the war.
	   The company welcomed the high court ruling in a statement issued
Monday and urged the plaintiffs to accept the decision as final.
	   Nachi Fujikoshi, which was set up in December 1928, is now
capitalized at 13.3 billion yen (dlrs 115 million) and employs
3,800 workers. It is located in Toyama, 255 kilometers (159 miles)
northwest of Tokyo.
	   Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945 and forced an
estimated 1.2 million Koreans to work in Japanese factories to
offset a domestic labor shortage.

Thomson CSF to cut 4,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - French defense group Thomson-CSF said the planned
cut of 4,000 jobs worldwide was part of a three-year plan to raise
the company's operating profit.
	   Company Chairman Denis Ranque said in Monday's edition of the
French business daily Les Echos that Thomson aimed to raise
operating profits to 7 percent of sales by 2001 from the current
5.7 percent.
	   Ranque said the company's profitability was within the
industry's average, ``But it's not enough for whomever wants to be
a leader in the sector.''
	   He said the cuts announced Friday - nearly 3,000 in France and
more than 1,000 elsewhere - were made necessary by industry
changes, the merger with Dassault Electronique and Alcatel's
military telecommunications activities and the need to cut
production costs.
	   Ranque said it was possible that all European missile-makers
could be part of one company in the very long-term.
	   ``Thomson-CSF has confirmed its strategic freedom which can lead
us either to reinforce our ties with Aerospatiale-Matra, which are
already very strong, or to look for other European alliances which
would be more structural and global,'' he said.
	   Within Europe's defense industry, Ranque said that ``our natural
partner would be GEC Marconi. Thomson-CSF could also envisage a
complementary alliance leading us eventually to become the
`electronic core' of the future EADC (European Aerospace and
Defense Company).''
	   Ranque explained that the government's stake in Thomson-CSF
would not be an obstacle to joining a future alliance.
	   ``The French government will accept to reduce its stake if it's
a condition to industrial success. I am confident with the
government's flexibility in that regard,'' Ranque said.

</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS stock price quotations in 7th-9th grafs

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) - Share prices in Hong Kong closed sharply higher
Monday, boosted by cuts in local interest rates.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
rose 169.78 points, or 1.7 percent, closing at 10,396.01. On
Friday, the index had gained 142.92 points.
	   Turnover amounted to 4.171 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
534 million), little changed from Friday's 4.13 billion dollars
(U.S. dlrs 529 million).
	   Brokers said shares prices gained in reaction to Friday's cut in
local interest rates, the fourth such reduction in four months.
	   The Hong Kong Association of Banks cut their deposit interest
rate to 4.25 percent from 4.5 percent. Banks also lowered their
lending rate to favored clients to 9 percent from 9.25 percent.
	   Trading was light as many investors stayed on the sidelines to
await the response of U.S. markets to the impeachment of President
Bill Clinton by the House of Representatives.
	   Among property stocks, Cheung Kong rose 2.50 Hong Kong dollars
to 58.25, and New World Development rose 75 cents to 20.35.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings rose 4.50 dollars to
198.50, and Hang Seng Bank rose 1.50 dollars to 72.00.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa rose 1.75 dollars to 56.50, and
Hong Kong Electric rose 5 cents to 23.80.

	   In his first public comments since the attacks ended late
Saturday, Saddam said in a speech on Sunday that Iraq was
victorious against ``enemies of God.''
	   In the televised address, Saddam said that the Iraqi people and
the army have proved to be ``worthy of what your leadership
expected from you.''

Muslims in Philippines burn U.S. flag to protest strikes on Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Muslim radicals burned the American
flag on Monday in front of the United States Embassy in Manila to
protest the U.S.-led military strikes on Iraq last week, police
said.
	   Left-wing workers and students condemning the attacks on Baghdad
also demonstrated separately near the embassy, which has been under
tight security since the bombings last August of U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Nairobi.
	   National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre said security forces
have been put on alert to deter possible action against U.S.
targets by Muslim extremist groups, which are active in the
southern Philippines.
	   Many of the 50 Muslim protesters, who belong to a group called
Philippine Muslim Task Force against U.S. Aggression, raised their
fists and yelled ``Allah is great!'' as they burned and trampled a
U.S. flag made of paper.
	   A statement by the group said the attack on Iraq was
unacceptable because it was carried out without specific U.N.
approval. It also said the military strike could provoke a violent
reaction from Muslims worldwide.
	   The left-wing protesters burned a mock missile then lit candles
on the sidewalk in front of the embassy in memory of the Iraqis who
died during the U.S.-led missile barrage.

1999 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The government of Flanders, Belgium's
Dutch-speaking northern half, said Monday in 1999 it will reimburse
its employees the full cost of commuting to and from work by public
transport.
	   It said the aim was to encourage its 20,000 civil servants to
leave their cars at home.
	   They now get 56 percent of public transport costs refunded.
Those who bicycle to work will also get a financial reward but
those who take their car will continue to get no reprieve.
	   The regional government said the deal will only be extended
beyond 1999 if a substantial number of employees _ at least an
additional 5 to 10 percent _ switches to train, streetcar, bus or
subway.

Ukraine introduces tax holiday for farmers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The government has granted a two-year tax
holiday to many of the country's struggling farms in an effort to
help them clear their huge debts, a news report said Monday.
	   The government decided Friday to exempt agricultural enterprises
from taxes until 2001 because their debts have become too large to
pay back, Deputy Agriculture Minister Yuriy Luzan said, according
to the independent Ukrainian News agency.
	   According to government data, farms owe more money to various
creditors than they now earn. State figures put the farm debt at
13.3 billion hryvna (dlrs 3.8 billion).
	   The poor state of Ukraine's agricultural sector, which was a
major food provider during the Soviet era, reflects the country's
steady economic decline since it gained independence in 1991.
	   The Cabinet wrote off some agricultural debts earlier this year
and introduced a single agricultural tax. But production has
continued to fall.

turmoil

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine peso closed higher
against the U.S. dollar Monday, buoyed by a strengthening trend in
regional currencies, traders said.
	   The dollar averaged 38.985 pesos on the Philippine Dealing
System, down 36.7 centavos from Friday's average of 39.352 pesos.
	   Volume totaled dlrs 81.6 million, compared with Friday's dlrs
dlrs 133.4 million.
	   The impeachment vote by the U.S. House of Representatives
against President Bill Clinton weighed down the dollar and helped
prop up Asian currencies, traders said.
	   The Philippine Central Bank was not active in the spot market.
It held its overnight borrowing and lending rates at 13.375 percent
and 15.375 percent, respectively.
	   Philippine shares, meanwhile ended lower Monday as investors
lightened their holdings on concern over the impeachment
proceedings against Clinton and the tension caused by U.S.-led
missile strikes targeting Iraq, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index closed 13.21
points, or 0.7 percent, lower at 1873.15. On Friday, it had gained
8.06 points, or 0.4 percent.
	   Fitzgerald Aklan, assistant vice president for institutional
sales at Orion-Squire Securities Inc., said most investors remained
wary of accumulating more shares following the impending trial of
Clinton in the U.S. Senate.
	   The Senate can remove the president from office with a
two-thirds majority vote.
	   The tension created by the strikes against Iraq compounded the
situation, Aklan said, adding lingering uncertainties would likely
continue to dampen the market for some time.
	   Total volume of shares traded Monday stood at 573.7 million
shares valued at 1.36 billion pesos compared with Friday's 982.4
million shares at 5.71 billion pesos. Decliners trounced gainers,
64 to 31, while 27 issues were unchanged.

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Prosecutors on Monday dropped murder
charges against a nurse in the deaths of 22 patients at a home for
the elderly, but left open the possibility she could be tried on
other charges.
	   The nurse was charged in October 1997, shocking a country that
prides itself on its extensive social services and good medical
care. At the time, police said the nurse also was suspected of
embezzling 384,000 kroner (dlrs 60,000) from the victims.
	   The 22 victims, aged 65 to 97, died after being given doses of a
morphine-based drug while in the care of the Plejebo nursing home
in downtown Copenhagen. The deaths occurred between August 1994 and
January 1997.
	   The nurse could still face other charges such as theft and
embezzlement, Hjorth said.
	   The nurse was fired from the home in March 1997 after admitting
to minor embezzlement.

Railway engineers strike for higher wages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Engineers of Hungary's state railway
staged a two-hour nationwide strike Monday, warning there would be
more to come if they didn't receive a pay raise.
	   All 5,400 engineers of Hungarian State Railways, walked off work
for two hours during the morning rush hour Monday, Janos Borsik,
deputy president of the engineers' trade union told state-run MTI
news agency.
	   During the strike 573 domestic and international passenger
trains ground to a halt, but heating and lighting was provided,
Borsik said.
	   The engineers are demanding a 21 percent increase in pay, while
their employees are offering them only 13 percent. Engineers
currently earn an average of is 96,000 forints (dlrs 465) per
month.
	   Railway administrators argue even a 1 percent wage rise means
over 500 million forints (dlrs 2.2 million) in extra spending. The
state railway is the country's biggest employer.
	   The trade union and the management are to meet for negotiations
later Monday, in hopes of avoiding a general strike in January,
Borsik was quoted by MTI as saying.
	   Monday's strike cost the railway 100 million forints (dlrs
400,000) in damage, officials said.
	   The other trade union at the company, the rail workers' union,
is to stage a similar strike Tuesday morning, said union leader
Imre Markus. Railway workers currently earn an average is 54,000
forints (dlrs 280) per month and are also demanding a 21 percent
pay increase.
	   The last railway strike in Hungary was held in April 1995, when
30 percent of all railway workers were on strike for four days.

Police detain 1,000 illegal aliens in countrywide swoop
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES in 2nd graf that 21 of the 40 detained remain in
custody &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Police have detained at least 1,000
suspected illegal aliens since a countrywide crackdown began in
November, a police spokesman said Monday.
	   King'ori Mwangi said the latest swoop Saturday at a Nairobi
shopping center netted more than 40 people, 21 of whom remain in
custody.
	   ``We are rounding up all aliens without proper documents to be
in the country,'' he said.
	   Members of Kenya's Indian community _ known locally as Asians _
claim the police action is only targeting Asians in order to extort
money from them.
	   ``We are not specifically targeting Asians in this case. We knew
where they (the illegal aliens) were,'' Mwangi said. ``We have
arrested people of all races _ black, European and Asian,'' he
said.
	   Since 1994 between 40,000 and 50,000 unskilled or semi-skilled
workers from the Indian region of Gujarat and from Pakistan have
found their way into Nairobi and several towns in central Kenya,
according to the independent Daily Nation newspaper.
	   The paper said immigration records show that fewer than 1,000
work permits are issued every year while evidence on the ground
shows that dozens of people from India and Pakistan are entering
the job market every day.
	   The newspaper said criminal syndicates lure would-be immigrants
with promises of good jobs in Kenya where unemployment is estimated
to be as high as 50 percent of the working age population.
	   The syndicates reportedly bribe Kenyan immigration officials to
issue false work and residence permits.
	   Mwangi said the crackdown will go on until all illegal aliens
are netted.
	   ``If they are refugees, they should remain in the camps. If they
want to work here, there is a process, not just sneaking in,''
Mwangi said.
	   He said most of the illegal aliens have been taken to court. If
they are convicted of being in the country illegally, they must
serve their prison sentences and then be deported.
	   ``Some of these aliens are known to be drug runners,'' Mwangi
said, ``We cannot compromise our security.''

	   A summary of news from The Associated Press. Some items have
moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f'' category
codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The House impeachment votes barely over,
senators are pondering how to handle what would be the first trial
of a sitting president in 130 years _ or even whether to conduct
one. Whatever the course, members of both parties said Sunday they
want a swift Senate resolution of the charges that President Bill
Clinton lied and obstructed justice in trying to cover up his
affair with Monica Lewinsky. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman
Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican, suggested the first step should be
a quick poll of his colleagues to determine if there is anywhere
near the 67 votes needed to oust Clinton from office.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Baghdad renewed its claim of victory on
Monday, and extremist Muslim groups threatened retaliation for the
four days of U.S.-British airstrikes against Iraq. Meanwhile, U.N.
officials said humanitarian workers would return to the Iraqi
capital on Tuesday to resume supervision of food aid. The workers
were evacuated last week to the neighboring Jordanian capital Amman
amid the bombardment. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, in his first
public comments since the attacks ended late Saturday, said Iraq
was victorious against ``enemies of God.'' In a brief speech Sunday
on radio and television, Saddam said the Iraqi people and the army
have proved to be ``worthy of what your leadership expected from
you.'' (IRAQ)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ In stern judgments capping a decisive crackdown
on dissidents, Chinese courts sentenced two prominent democracy
campaigners to 13 and 11 years in prison Monday for trying to
organize an opposition political party. The 13-year prison term
given Xu Wenli after a 3 1/2-hour trial in Beijing was the longest
for a Chinese dissident in three years. His colleague in the China
Democracy Party, Wang Youcai, was sentenced to 11 years, in a
verdict announced by a court in Hangzhou four days after his trial.
Xu's conviction deprives the would-be opposition group of a potent
organizer and the fractured dissident community at large of a
strong and moderating voice. Xu remained defiant during his tightly
controlled trial on subversion charges. He refused to answer
questions from prosecutors and judges and responded only to those
from his lawyer, the court-appointed attorney, Mo Shaoping, said.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's fractious
ruling coalition appeared poised Monday to crumble, ushering in
what could be weeks or even months of paralysis on the
Israeli-Palestinian peace front. On Monday, Israel's parliament was
to take up a welter of measures that _ taken separately or together
_ are seen as a broad referendum on the peace process. Those
include a no-confidence motion against Netanyahu's government _
perhaps more than one _ plus a possible measure to set early
elections, along with a separate vote by lawmakers on Netanyahu's
latest stance toward the Palestinians. (ISRAEL-POLITICS)
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Pro-secular Premier-designate Bulent
Ecevit on Monday officially returned his mandate to form a new
government after failing to gather enough support in Parliament.
``I asked to be excused from this mission as I have failed to
gather enough support in Parliament despite all my efforts,''
Ecevit told reporters after meeting with President Suleyman
Demirel. Refusing any alliance with the pro-Islamic Virtue Party _
Turkey's largest party in Parliament _ Ecevit was unable to create
a political alliance to secure a confidence vote from a highly
divided legislature. Ecevit brushed aside an offer to join hands
with a rival social democrat party leader, his long-time enemy, and
his idea to form a minority government was shunned by the Virtue
and most right-wing parties. (TURKEY-POLITICS)

move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mixed Monday, with
share prices slipping in Tokyo but surging in Seoul. Meanwhile, the
U.S. dollar fell against the Japanese yen on concerns over the
impeachment of U.S. President Bill Clinton. On the Seoul Stock
Exchange, the key index surged 7.7 percent on expectations for an
upgrade in the country's debt rating early next year. The hope for
an improved rating was sparked by Moody's Investors Service's
announcement last week that South Korea's foreign exchange reserves
have risen to a level necessary for the repayment of emergency
loans acquired during the height of the financial crisis in 1997.
The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 40.42 points to 565.27.
(ASIAN MARKETS)
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong has registered deflation for the
first time in 23 years, the government reported Monday, raising
fears that the territory's recession-mired economy will not rebound
for quite some time. The composite consumer price index fell by 0.7
percent in November compared with the same month in 1997, the
Census and Statistics Department said. The index edged up by only
0.1 percent year-on-year in October. For the first 11 months of
this year, the pricing index was up 3.2 percent compared with the
same period last year. A government statement said ``the slack
overall economic conditions'' contributed to the slump in prices
last month. It cited a freeze in government fees and charges, lower
costs for clothing, housing and food and low inflation rates in
other economies as factors pushing down the inflation rate in Hong
Kong. (HONG KONG-DEFLATION)
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore said Monday that its key economic
indicator, which charts exports of non-oil domestically produced
goods, fell a greater-than-expected 6.5 percent in November
compared to a year ago, signaling it remains entrenched in its
worst slump in decades. ``The worsening economic conditions in the
five crisis-ridden economies (Japan, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Thailand
and Korea), which account for 42.8 percent of Singapore's trade, as
well as the lackluster global demand for certain electronic
products, continued to take its toll,'' the Southeast Asian island
republic's Trade Development Board said in a statement. Exports of
electronics, which drive Singapore's manufacturing sector and
typically account for about 70 percent of non-oil domestic exports,
fell 7.6 percent on the year in November due to global
over-capacity and price weakness, the trade board said.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia has asked Japan for a
dlrs 5 billion share of Tokyo's dlrs 30 billion recovery package
earmarked for struggling Asian economies, a news report said
Monday. Malaysia's Second Finance Minister Mustapa Mohamad said
that if Malaysia received the money, it would be sufficient to
finance his nation's 1999 budget deficit, the state-run Bernama
news agency reported. Recession has taken its toll on Malaysia's
economy. The inflation rate has risen, industrial production has
fallen 10.4 percent and the overall economy shrank 8.6 percent in
the third quarter, a dramatic slowdown from a 7.8 percent growth
rate in 1997. (MALAYSIA-ECONOMY)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ More than 20 percent of all Russians received
monthly wages below the national subsistence level in the first 11
months of the year, a news report said Monday. Over 35 million
Russians, or 24 percent of the population, had a monthly income
below 619 rubles (dlrs 30) each month from January through
November, the Interfax news agency said, citing figures from the
State Statistics Committee. The figure was up from 21 percent of
the population for the same period in 1997. Most of the change was
believed linked to the economic crisis that hit in August, which
led to greater unemployment and exacerbated the government's
inability to pay state workers. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)

	   Longstanding animosities have split Turkey's center-left and
center-right for more than a decade.
	   Ecevit brushed aside an offer to join hands with a rival social
democrat party leader, his long-time rival, and his idea of forming
a minority government lacked support.
	   Ecevit was asked to form the government three weeks ago after
Mesut Yilmaz' coalition collapsed over allegations that he had ties
with the mob and tampered with the sale of a state bank.
	   Ecevit leaves Demirel with a difficult task.
	   Demirel already broke with the tradition of appointing the
leader of the largest party in parliament to form a government in
order to keep the Virtue Party from power.
	   The staunchly secular military opposes a return of an Islamic
party to power. Turkey's first Islamic-led government formed after
elections in 1995 was pressured out of office by the military for
not keeping to the country's secular traditions.
	   Ecevit even refused to consult with the leader of the Virtue
Party during his efforts to form a government.

	   LONDON (AP) _ British tycoon Richard Branson and his crew
skirted the Himalayas on Monday, but encountered a new obstacle in
their quest to circle the globe in a balloon when China abruptly
denied them permission to fly over its territory.
	   It was the second time politics threatened to derail the voyage.
Libya also unexpectedly denied permission, but backed down at the
last moment Saturday.
	   Branson and the ground crew of ICO Global, a mobile telephone
company that is supporting the trip, were scrambling to persuade
the Chinese to reverse the decision.
	   The British government said its ambassador in China had taken
the problem up with Chinese authorities and that the Foreign Office
was speaking to the Chinese Embassy in London.
	   The balloon still does not have permission to enter Chinese
airspace and should not cross the Chinese frontier, a Foreign
Office spokesman said.
	   ``If they do, they must follow all instructions from the Chinese
authorities,'' he said on customary terms of anonymity.

Honda says it may rejoin Formula One in 2000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Honda Motor Co., Japan's No. 3 automaker, said
Monday it has begun considering a bid to rejoin the World Formula
One car race championship from 2000.
	   ``We have started test runs for a car in preparation for
participation in the Formula One, possibly from 2000,'' said
Hiroyuki Yoshino, president of Honda Motor, at a news conference in
Tokyo.
	   Yoshino said Honda has designed and built a test car with its
own engine and held a test run in the outskirts of Milan, Italy on
Dec. 15.
	   He declined to comment on the car's performance, but said Honda
will continue with test runs next year.
	   Honda withdrew from the Formula One in 1992.
	   It first joined the F-1 race in 1964, but pulled out in 1968.
After rejoining in 1984, the McLaren-Honda team won six consecutive
seasons from 1986 to 1991.

 &UR; Veteran dissident Xu knows prison from long term in solitary
confinement
 &UR; By RENEE SCHOOF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ With a quick trial and 13-year sentence for
veteran democracy activist Xu Wenli, Chinese authorities moved to
silence a moderate voice and skillful organizer from China's small
dissident community.
	   Xu will now return to a prison system he knows well from a spell
spent touring its darkest side. Convicted of subversion once before
_ in 1982 _ Xu spent 12 years in prison, much of it in solitary
confinement.
	   For 3 1/2 years, he lived in a concrete, windowless box so small
he could not stand up.
	   ``They are putting an innocent man in jail,'' his daughter, Xu
Jin, said. ``They put him in jail during his golden age for 12
years. Once again, he's facing that prospect and he's not that
young anymore. His health is not that good.''
	   Going with Xu into confinement will be Wang Youcai, a student
leader in the 1989 democracy movement who has already spent two
years in prison. He was sentenced to another 11 years in jail on
Monday.
	   Both Xu and Wang were trying to break communist China's 49-year
ban on opposition politics by organizing other dissidents to
register the China Democracy Party.
	   Unlike Wang, who began his activism as a Beijing University
student in the relatively better-off 1980s, Xu did a stint in the
People's Liberation Army and then worked as an electrician in the
1970s.
	   In a display of his political skills, Xu united dissidents
publishing underground journals to form one of the most influential
periodicals of the heady Democracy Wall movement in 1978.
	   At his one-day trial in 1982, Xu was sentenced to 15 years in
prison. Two years later, he secretly wrote an account of his arrest
and trial that was smuggled out of prison and shocked a West still
in the midst of an optimistic embrace of a changing China.
	   Xu wrote that he was moved into a damp vault with a cement
floor, a mat for a bed, a bucket for a toilet and a lightbulb that
burned night and day. He ate cornmeal buns, salt and water. He was
never allowed out for the full 3 1/2 years. Family visits were
canceled.
	   Afterward, he remained in solitary confinement in a small cell
with no heating. Neighboring cells held prisoners who were sick
with tuberculosis and other diseases, according to a 1993 account
by Asia Watch.
	   In 1991, two year's before his release, his wife's appeal to
prison authorities to let her send him a radio or television was
turned down. He was not even allowed a photograph of his wife and
daughter in the cell.
	   When he became politically active again after his parole ended
last year, Xu seemed neither embittered nor broken. He turned to
writing once again about democracy and China's future and openly
organizing other dissidents.

Women's super-G postponed to later date
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEGEVE, France (AP) _ A women's World Cup super-G on Monday was
postponed to a later date, when fog prevented organizers from
safely running the race.
	   After delaying the start by nearly three hours _ to wait for the
fog to lift but also avoid television braodcasting conflicts with a
men's race in Innsbruck, Austria _ race officials were forced to
let skiers out early for their Christmas break.
	   It was the first time this season a women's World Cup race was
called off.
	   The men were already forced to abort a downhill and a super-G in
Whistler, Canada, due to poor weather.
	   The International Ski Federation has not yet decided when or
where to reschedule the women's super-G.
	   After a six-day break for the holidays, technical skiers on the
women's circuit will resume competition with a night slalom and a
giant slalom in Semmering, Austria.
	   Women racing in the speed events will have until New Year's day,
when a super-G is scheduled in Maribor, Slovenia.
	   World Cup leader Alexandra Meissnitzer will be able to spend a
worry-free Christmas with a comfortable 307-point lead atop the
overall standings. The Austrian, who has won five-of-12 World Cup
races this season, can also rest easy with her leads in the super-G
and giant slalom events secure for another week at least.

Humanitarian program set back, 260,000 tons of rice destroyed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Iraq &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.S and British airstrikes disrupted the
distribution of supplies under the U.N.-approved oil-for-food
program, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Iraq said Monday.
	   His said that a warehouse full of rice _ which the United
Nations earlier had said was destroyed _ was in the city of Tikrit.
	   Tikrit, the home town of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, is 170
kilometers (106 miles) north of Baghdad.
	   The warehouse, managed by the U.N. World Food Program, held
260,000 tons of rice.
	   The U.N. humanitarian coordinator, Hans von Sponeck, told
Associated Press Television News that ``our program has been
severely curtailed.''
	   More than 100 U.N. aid workers were evacuated last Friday to the
Jordanian capital Amman, but U.N. officials said they would return
to Iraq on Tuesday.
	   Those workers _ along with about 30 ``essential staff'' who
stayed in Baghdad _ supervise the oil-for-food program.
	   The program, which is an exception to U.N. sanctions imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, allows Iraq to sell limited
quantities of oil to buy needed food and medicine for its 22
million people.
	   Oil continued to flow during the bombardment, both U.N. and
Iraqi officials said. But the arrival of food was disrupted because
monitors were not in place.
	   Also Monday, the U.N. Children's Fund, UNICEF, said in a
statement that it has drawn up plans to repair some of the
buildings in Baghdad that were damaged during the airstrikes.
	   It said two hospitals in Baghdad sustained damage as well as a
``few primary schools.''
	   It added that U.N. teams had been sent to the southern city of
Basra, which also was hit, ``to make further assessment of
damage.''
	   The United Nations monitors Iraq's distribution of food and
medicine and central and southern areas.
	   In the Kurdish north, the U.N. humanitarian workers have sole
responsibility. U.N. workers were not evacuated from the north
during the latest military action.
	   Von Sponeck said his contacts with Iraqi officials, including
Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, continued as usual.
	   ``We discuss all kinds of problems,'' he said. ``I don't detect
any difference.''

Polish miners hold warning strike over pension reforms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Miners in southern Poland held a warning
strike Monday to protest pension reforms and vote on whether to
call a general strike.
	   The PAP state news agency reported that workers at coal mines in
Silesia, as well as zinc and lead ore mines, began the two-hour
strike Monday morning.
	   Union officials said the strike would be observed at all Polish
mines by the end of the day, with workers on each shift getting the
chance to vote on whether to begin a general strike on an
undetermined date.
	   Miners were expected to favor a general strike, and union
leaders planned to meet government representatives and mine company
officials on Tuesday before deciding how to proceed.
	   At least 415 workers at 50 coal mines continued an underground
sit-in Monday in their campaign against proposed changes in
retirement rules, PAP reported.
	   Parliament has approved setting retirement age limits of 65 for
men and 60 for women. Under the current formula, miners and others
working in dangerous conditions could retire with full pensions
after 25 years of work, no matter their age.
	   While the proposed changes would continue to allow for early
retirement for at least seven more years, mining unions say they
want the present system to remain intact. They also oppose a mining
restructuring plan that would cut jobs and production.
	   Mining, one of Poland's major industries, is undergoing reforms
as the economy completes the shift from communist-style central
control to free market principles.

	   LONDON (AP) _ British tycoon Richard Branson and his crew
skirted the Himalayas on Monday, but encountered a new obstacle in
their quest to circle the globe in a balloon when China abruptly
denied them permission to fly over its territory.
	   It was the second time politics threatened to derail the voyage.
Libya also unexpectedly denied permission, but backed down at the
last moment Saturday.
	   Branson and the ground crew of ICO Global, a mobile telephone
company that is supporting the trip, were scrambling to persuade
the Chinese to reverse the decision.
	   The British government said its ambassador in China had taken
the problem up with Chinese authorities and that the Foreign Office
was speaking to the Chinese Embassy in London.
	   The balloon still does not have permission to enter Chinese
airspace and should not cross the Chinese frontier, a Foreign
Office spokesman said.
	   Branson, Chicago millionaire Steve Fossett and teammate Per
Lindstrand were flying along the Himalaya mountain range Monday
morning on their way toward China.
	   The Virgin boss and his team reached the towering mountain range
shortly after dawn and were expected to fly over the top of the
Himalayas, catching sight of Everest and K2 on the way.
	   Weather conditions can deteriorate rapidly in the Himalayas,
however, and gusts of warm air from below can prove a formidable
challenge to balloonists.
	   The 270-foot (82-meter) balloon reached the Himalayas after a
quiet day Sunday crossing Turkmenistan in Central Asia and flying
over Afghanistan.
	   Over the weekend, the team had faced fierce thunderstorms and
was forced to pass through a narrow corridor in the Caucasus to
avoid flying over Iraq, Iran and Russia, which had denied the crew
the right to use their airspace.
	   Branson and Lindstrand both broke their personal duration
records of 48 hours in a hot air balloon during a 1991 crossing of
the Pacific.
	   Fossett has made four tries to ring the globe. Branson has
tried, and failed, four times to become the first person to circle
the world in a balloon.
	   Improved technology has been used to make the balloon, including
a canopy of Kevlar of the kind used for bulletproof vests.
	   The crew members estimate the trip could last from eight days to
nearly three weeks.
	   They hope to touch down somewhere in western Europe at the end
of a 24,000-mile (62,000 kms) flight, which will take them over
India, the South China sea, the Pacific and the United States.
	   The plan is to cross San Francisco on Christmas Day, with a goal
of reaching Europe by New Year's.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and initially had only four refusals _ Iran, Iraq, Russia and North
Korea.
	   At least three other crews have been waiting for favorable
weather to launch balloons _ from Albuquerque, New Mexico, Loves
Park, Illinois, and the Swiss Alps. Yet another team plans to take
off next month from Alice Springs, Australia.

Guards stop 117 illegal aliens near Ukrainian-Hungarian border

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ A record number of illegal aliens were
caught on the Hungarian side of the border with Ukraine, an
official said Monday.
	   Officials found 117 men in two trucks that were moving
suspiciously early Monday between Tunyogmatolcs and Fehergyarmat,
240 kilometers (150 miles) east of Budapest, border guard spokesman
Attila Krisan said.
	   The men had no identification documents with them, but admitted
they were citizens of Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh.
	   This was the biggest single catch of illegal aliens, said
Krisan, adding that the men will be returned to Ukraine.
	   Two Hungarian truck drivers are charged with smuggling humans,
Krisan said.

<TEXT>
	   SIHANOUKVILLE, Cambodia (AP) _ Four people were killed in
accidents Monday when as many as 1,000 Cambodians fled a seaport
city, fearing exposure to suspected toxic waste and increasingly
violent protests against those responsible for allowing the waste
to be brought in from Taiwan.
	   Buses, taxis and a morning train leaving Sihanoukville for the
capital, Phnom Penh, 185 kilometers (115 miles) to the north, were
packed. Police said at least seven accidents had been reported on
the bumpy, narrow road north out of the city.
	   Em Bun Sath, the local police commissioner, confirmed that four
people had been killed and at least 13 injured in the sudden
exodus.
	   ``We are still counting'' the number of casualties, he added.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh, president of the National Assembly,
said that he had been informed that a dlrs 3 million bribe had been
paid to officials to allow the Taiwanese waste to be dumped in
Cambodia.
	   Secretary of State for Rural Development Ly Thuch said that
Ranariddh and Prime Minister Hun Sen had agreed ``to take serious
measures to punish those who are responsible for such a disaster.''
	   Among those leaving Sihanoukville were customs officials, blamed
by protesters for letting the waste into the country, and their
families.
	   In one accident, a pickup truck loaded with more than 20 people
collided with a minivan, killing at least one person and injuring
several others.
	   ``We were escaping because we were afraid of death, only to be
injured in this accident,'' injured passenger Preap Nary, 35, said
at a Sihanoukville hospital. Her three children were also hurt.
	   About 60 demonstrators marched on the offices of the district
offices about 10 kilometers (six miles) north of Sihanoukville
where 3,000 tons of waste was quietly deposited about two weeks ago
without public warning.
	   Meanwhile, two workers from the human rights group Licadho were
arrested by police for allegedly inciting protesters Sunday during
violent demonstrations in which the deputy governor's home and
vehicle were wrecked.
	   A Licadho official in Phnom Penh said the two had been
monitoring the protests but emphatically denied their involvement.
	   ``They certainly were not participating, nor were they leaders
or organizers of the riots,'' Eva Galabru said. ``It's probably the
fruit of a misunderstanding.''
	   Since the dump was found by Environment Ministry investigators a
week ago, tensions have steadily risen amid reports the waste may
be toxic.
	   A boiling point was reached after the mysterious death of a port
worker who is said to have cleaned the hold of the ship that
brought the waste from Taiwan.
	   Although doctors have so far not established a clear link
between the waste and his death, protesters took to the streets
Saturday and threw rocks at a goods-inspection office at the port.
	   Violence continued Sunday as demonstrators ransacked a hotel
they believed was owned by the inspection company. Police later
fired assault rifles over the heads of the mob and dispersed it
after the home and off-road vehicle of Deputy Governor Khim Bo were
trashed.
	   Environment Minister Mok Mareth has blamed an unnamed government
official and port authorities for allowing the waste illegal entry.
	   The Taiwanese company that sent the waste has said it obtained
permits from Taiwanese and Cambodian authorities to export it. Hun
Sen has insisted that the waste be returned to Taiwan, which has so
far refused to take it back.
	   The company, Formosa Plastics Corp., has denied the material is
toxic but admitted it does contain traces of mercury, which is
highly poisonous in large doses.
	   Residents living near the dump have complained that they have
suffered from exhaustion and diarrhea after rummaging through the
waste.
	   Bulldozers pushed mounds of earth around the dump site Sunday.
Environment officials said they would cover the waste with plastic
tarpaulins to contain any toxic substances until the material can
be removed.
	   Mok Mareth said Monday that protective suits are being purchased
abroad for workers who will eventually shovel the waste into oil
drums and load them into shipping containers at the port.

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Prosecutors on Monday dropped murder
charges against a nurse in the deaths of 22 patients at a home for
the elderly, but left open the possibility she could be tried on
other charges.
	   The nurse was charged in October 1997, shocking a country that
prides itself on its extensive social services and good medical
care. At the time, police said the nurse also was suspected of
embezzling 384,000 kroner (dlrs 60,000) from the victims.
	   The 22 victims, aged 65 to 97, died after being given doses of a
morphine-based drug while in the care of the Plejebo nursing home
in downtown Copenhagen. The deaths occurred between August 1994 and
January 1997.
	   The nurse, who cannot be named under a court order, could still
face other charges such as theft and embezzlement, Prosecutor
Karsten Hjorth said.
	   The nurse was fired from the home in March 1997 after admitting
to minor embezzlement.

Assailants of Jewish grave sought, security may be stepped up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Berlin authorities said Monday they may step up
protection of the city's Jewish sites as police continued to hunt
for assailants who exploded a bomb on the grave of Germany's former
Chairman of the Central Council of Jews.
	   The attack Saturday night destroyed the memorial slab that
covered Heinz Galinski's last resting place in a cemetary in Heer
street in the Charlottenburg district.
	   Berlin's Interior Senator, Eckart Werthebach, said the bomb, a
homemade device, was packed into the steel cap of a gas canister
for maximum explosive impact.
	   A special team from the Staatsschutz, the federal agency that
deals with acts of political criminality, was investigating the
attack, Werthebach's spokesman Martin Strunden said.
	   Three months ago a similar attack on Galinski's grave caused
minor damage.
	   City authorities were discussing improving protection of Jewish
sites, said Strunden.
	   Berlin's main synagogue receives police protection, as do other
Jewish sites across Germany.
	   Germans have reacted with horror to the attack. Volker Beck, a
legal expert for the Greens, the junior government coalition
partner, said it showed anti-semitism continued to fester in the
country.
	   In a telegram earlier to Galinski's wife Ruth, President Roman
Herzog called the attack ``the result of crazy minds and the work
of confused loners,'' and said he wanted to express his sadness and
pain for himself and the Germans.
	   Galinski was born in 1912 in Poland. He gained wide respect as
the outspoken but fair head of Berlin's Jewish community from 1949
until his death. He took over as Chairman of the Central Council of
Jews in 1988.
	   He died in Berlin on July 19, 1992 following heart surgery.

Report: Japanese government panel approves Viagra
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese Health Ministry panel decided to allow
the import and manufacture of Viagra on Monday, and the
anti-impotence drug is likely to get formal government approval by
January, news reports said.
	   The Central Pharmaceutical Affairs Council approved the drug at
a special meeting Monday, and the decision was expected to be
ratified when the council convenes its regular meeting later this
month, national broadcaster NHK said.
	   Health Ministry official Haruo Akagawa declined to confirm the
report, saying only that the drug ``cleared a stage'' Monday on the
way to approval.
	   U.S. pharmaceuticals company Pfizer Inc. applied to market
Viagra in Japan in July, and Kyodo News agency reported the
government approval to market the drug has been secured with
unprecedented speed.
	   Officials have reportedly become concerned by the enormous black
market for Viagra that has sprung up in Japan. Several people have
been arrested for smuggling the drug into the country or selling it
illegally.
	   It has been selling for about 6,000 yen (dlrs 49) a pill on the
black market in Japan, compared to roughly dlrs 10 per pill charged
by pharmacies in the United States.
	   In July, the Health Ministry issued a warning against taking
Viagra without instructions when a man who had been taking
medication for high blood pressure died after taking the drug.

Two Israelis plead innocent to spying, trial postponed

<TEXT>
	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) _ Two Israelis charged with spying on
Cyprus pleaded innocent Monday, and their trial was postponed until
next month.
	   Udi Hargov and Igal Damary, whose case has strained relations
between Israel and Cyprus, also were denied bail.
	   Israel has denied they were spying on Cyprus on behalf of Turkey
but hasn't said what their mission was.
	   But it is believed to have been a bungled operation by the
Mossad, possibly related to anti-aircraft missiles that Cyprus is
planning to deploy on the island in the next few weeks.
	   Israeli media reported it had led to the resignation of the
second-in-command at the intelligence agency.
	   Hargov, 37, and Damary, 49, were brought to court handcuffed and
guarded by armed members of the special police anti-terrorist
squad. Neither spoke during the brief proceedings, except to plead
innocent to three separate charges.
	   The trial is to open Jan. 20.
	   The two were arrested Nov. 6 at Zigi, a small fishing village on
the southern coast of Cyprus next to an army camp and a military
training area.
	   In addition to spying, they were charged with conspiring to
commit a crime while in Israel and Cyprus between Oct. 15 and Nov.
6, and with possessing scanning and recording equipment without a
government license.
	   They face a maximum sentence of 10 years.
	   The November arrest came only two days after Israeli President
Ezer Weizman ended the first official visit to the island by an
Israeli head of state.
	   The spying charge says the two men collected military
information ``which could be useful to any other state, with the
objective of harming the interests of the Republic of Cyprus.''
	   Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres pleaded for the
release of the two men during a visit to Cyprus last week.
	   He maintained the case amounted to ``a mistake and not a
crime.'' But he refused to divulge the purpose of the mission of
the two Israelis, beyond implying that it was connected with
Israel's fight against terrorism.
	   ``We have to fight terror and, unfortunately, mistakes of this
nature happen, also in other places. It wasn't bad intentions, or
any attempt to spy on Cyprus or against Cyprus, this is nonsense,''
Peres told a news conference.
	   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south
and a Turkish-occupied north since 1974, when Turkey invaded
following an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   Tension has risen on the island because of threats by Turkey to
prevent the planned deployment by Cyprus of Russian S-300
anti-aircraft missiles.
	   Both Israel and Turkey are known to be interested in gaining
information on the arrival of the missiles, expected in the next
few weeks.

Ruddock, Sinclair charged with damaging woman's car
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROMFORD, England (AP) _ West Ham stars Neil Ruddock and Trevor
Sinclair will appear in court on Tuesday after being arrested for
allegedly damaging a woman's car after the club's Christmas Party
on Saturday night.
	   ``It would appear they have let themselves down,'' Hammers
manager Harry Redknapp said on Monday. ``They were out on their
Christmas party. I just told them to enjoy themselves and to make
sure they behave.
	   ``It appears a couple of them have got themselves into a bit of
trouble by getting arrested. If it is right that they have
misbehaved then you can be sure we will read them the riot act.''
	   Ruddock, a center-back who has played once for England, has been
charged with violent behavior and is alleged to have thrown a
bottle at a car belonging to 19-year-old beauty therapist Linda
Knowles outside a night club at Romford, east of London.
	   Sinclair, an England Under-21 and 'B' international forward, is
charged with criminal damage to the car.
	   The incident happened several hours after West Ham's 2-1 victory
over Everton in the Premier League. The two players were arrested
after police went to the West Ham Christmas party, a '70s fancy
dress night, at Secrets nightclub in the town.
	   According to the Sun tabloid, Knowles and her female passenger
were waiting at traffic lights when she alleged three pedestrians
blocked her path.
	   She told the paper that one man rolled across the roof of the
Mini and damaged her windscreen wiper, radio aerial and wing
mirror.
	   Another man climbed on her bonnet, but she drove off when he
jumped off.

Women's super-G postponed to later date
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEGEVE, France (AP) _ A women's World Cup super-G on Monday was
postponed to a later date, when fog prevented organizers from
safely running the race.
	   After delaying the start by nearly three hours _ to wait for the
fog to lift but also to avoid television braodcasting conflicts
with a men's race in Innsbruck, Austria _ race officials were
forced to let skiers out early for their Christmas break.
	   It was the first time this season a women's World Cup race was
called off.
	   The men were already forced to abort a downhill and a super-G in
Whistler, Canada, due to poor weather.
	   The International Ski Federation has not yet decided when or
where to reschedule the women's super-G.
	   After a six-day break for the holidays, technical skiers on the
women's circuit will resume competition with a night slalom and a
giant slalom in Semmering, Austria.
	   Women racing in the speed events will have until New Year's Day,
when a super-G is scheduled in Maribor, Slovenia.
	   World Cup leader Alexandra Meissnitzer will be able to spend a
worry-free Christmas with a comfortable 307-point lead atop the
overall standings. The Austrian, who has won five-of-12 World Cup
races this season, can also rest easy with her leads in the super-G
and giant slalom events secure for another week at least.

Thailand urges armed groups in Myanmar to contain fighting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Fearing for the safety of Thais living
along the frontier, the Foreign Ministry on Monday urged the
Myanmar government and ethnic rebels opposed to it to contain
anticipated fighting to their side of the Thai-Myanmar border.
	   Intelligence reports cited by the Thai army monitoring the
tense, rugged border indicate that Myanmar's military government is
preparing for a major annual offensive against ethnic rebel groups.
	   Rebels from the Shan and Karenni ethnic groups announced over
the weekend that they have joined forces to fight the Myanmar army.
	   Thailand fears the fighting could spill over onto Thai
territory.
	   In a statement, the ministry urged all sides to respect
Thailand's sovereignty and stated that no armed group will be
allowed to use Thai soil to launch attacks.
	   Some 100,000 refugees from Myanmar, also known as Burma, are
strung out in camps along the Thai border, frequently serving as
rear bases for ethnic rebels battling Myanmar's central government
for decades.
	   Myanmar troops and their allies among the ethnic groups were
accused last year of raiding and burning several camps to destroy
support for the Karen National Union, the largest of the ethnic
armies.

Security tight at U.S., British embassies after attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Scores of riot police were deployed
around the American and British embassies in Damascus on Monday,
two days after demonstrators attacked the missions to protest
military strikes against Iraq.
	   The Syrian Foreign Ministry on Monday expressed regret over the
attacks and pledged to upgrade security at diplomatic missions and
international organizations.
	   More than 1,000 demonstrators, mostly students, attacked the
U.S. and British embassies and their cultural institutes Saturday
to protest U.S. and British airstrikes on Iraq.
	   The bombardment was called off Saturday.
	   The British ambassador to Damascus, Basil Eastwood, protested to
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa late Saturday for the
attack on the British Embassy and British Council.
	   According to a British Embassy statement, al-Sharaa offered a
``full apology and stressed that there will be suitable protection
for all British buildings and nationals.''

Parliamentary showdown set over Netanyahu's peace policies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 3-4 with behind-the-scenes maneuvering over
which measures to be voted on, drops radio attribution on Shahak's
intentions. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's fractious
ruling coalition appeared poised Monday to finally crack apart,
ushering in what could be weeks or even months of paralysis on the
Israeli-Palestinian peace front.
	   On Monday, Israel's parliament prepared to take up a welter of
measures that _ separately or together _ were seen as a broad
referendum on the peace process.
	   Measures that may come up for a vote include a no-confidence
motion against Netanyahu's government _ perhaps more than one _
plus a possible measure to set early elections, along with what
could be a separate vote by lawmakers on Netanyahu's latest stance
toward the Palestinians.
	   But by mid-afternoon, soon before the scheduled start of the
Knesset session, a frantic flurry of behind-the-scenes dealmaking
and arms-twisting still had not yielded a firm parliamentary
agenda. However, the no-confidence motions were looking less likely
to be put forward.
	   In the two months since the signing of the U.S.-brokered Wye
River land-for-security accords, the prime minister has been under
fire from both supporters and opponents of the peace process _ for
very different reasons.
	   The Israeli left accuses Netanyahu of bad faith and
foot-dragging, saying the prime minister never intended to live up
to promises made under the landmark Oslo accords signed by slain
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   Since Netanyahu took office in May 1996, the peace proces has
been largely stalled. The signing of the Wye accords on Oct. 23 in
Washington represented a dramatic break in what had been a 19-month
deadlock.
	   The accord's right-wing opponents, among them Jewish settlers,
have expressed fury at Netanyahu for agreeing to hand over more
West Bank land to the Palestinians in exchange for security steps.
Previously, he had promised to fight any such concessions.
	   Setting the stage for Monday's parliamentary action, Netanyahu's
Cabinet on Sunday approved a tough set of conditions for resuming
Israel's compliance with the Wye accords. Netanyahu said he would
hold a vote to check lawmakers' views of that move.
	   Netanyahu says the conditions _ including a demand that Arafat
renounce his intentions to declare independence by the end of May
are justified because the Palestinians have not met obligations
under the agreement.
	   The Palestinians say they have, and denounce the delays as
unfair and inflammatory.
	   One of several scenarios could unfold in the Knesset later
Monday.
	   A successful no-confidence motion would mean new elections would
be held within 60 days. Even Netanyahu's allies acknowledge he
would likely lose; he holds only a one-seat majority in the
120-seat house, and support from his coalition partners has
crumbled.
	   Another possibility was a passage of a separate measure calling
for early elections _ which Netanyahu himself may support. If it is
approved, the bill would then return to the Knesset law committee
for debate and then back to the floor for two more readings before
becoming law.
	   Alternatively, Netanyahu and the opposition could simply agree
on an election date, expected to be in April. On the eve of the
vote, 67 Knesset members said they would support early elections.
	   Yet another potential move would be Netanyahu's resignation,
which would trigger elections within 60 days. That was considered
unlikely, however.
	   The timetable on early elections _ whether within 60 days or
later _ could be an important consideration because of constraints
faced by a prime potential opponent, Lt. Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak.
	   Shahak, who has been on leave since stepping down as army chief
of staff in July, will announce his retirement from the military
once elections were called.
	   Under law, Shahak would be banned from participating in politics
for 100 days after his departure from the armed forces. But with a
presidential dispensation, that could be shortened to 50 days.
	   Little is known of Shahak's policies. As a soldier, he is
prohibited from expressing an opinion, but his deep involvement in
the peace talks suggests he is a moderate who favors territorial
concessions.
	   Polls have suggested that a centrist bid by Shahak would likely
push Labor Party leader Ehud Barak out of the race in the first
round of voting and lead to a run-off between Netanyahu and Shahak.
	   Barak, whose party began the Israel-Palestinian peace process in
1993, told Israel TV a Shahak bid would be an ``unnecessary
division of strengths.''

Airstrikes left Iraqi air defense in ruins, Britain says

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with latest assessment of attack success &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British-U.S. airstrikes on Iraq hit 100 sites and
left the Iraqi air defense system ``in ruins,'' Prime Minister Tony
Blair's office said Monday.
	   The prime minister's spokesman said 30 of the targets in the
four-day Operation Desert Fox were connected with Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction program.
	   Twenty were command and control facilities or communications
centers, and nine were connected with the elite Republican Guard,
the spokesman said with customary anonymity.
	   Attacks on another 35 of the targets ``have left the Iraqi air
defense system in ruins,'' and six targets were related to the
delivery system of Iraq's remotely piloted weapons of mass
destruction, he said.
	   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said earlier that Britain's next
step would be to try to isolate Iraq in the world community and
reduce any support Saddam Hussein's regime has among Arab nations.
	   Cook said there also would be new attempts to get humanitarian
aid to the Iraqi people directly _ and not through Saddam's regime.

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Exiled Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng
praised Taiwan Monday for proving democracy could thrive in a
Chinese society, but warned against incurring Beijing's wrath by
formally declaring independence.
	   ``Taiwan has proven that regardless of whether you're white or
Asian, you can establish a first-rate democracy,'' Wei told a news
conference at the start of a nine-day visit to the island.
	   He called on Taiwan to ignore China's demands to reunify in the
near term. But as long as China threatens an invasion to prevent
Taiwan going independent, Taiwanese should preserve their interests
and ``exercise their right not to declare independence,'' Wei said.
	   ``China's definition of reunification means accepting the
Communists' single party rule, under these conditions _ think about
it _ what sort of person would want to reunify?'' he said.
	   During his first-ever visit to Taiwan, Wei will be received by
top government officials, including President Lee Teng-hui and
Premier Vincent Siew, along with officials of the ruling
Nationalist Party.
	   His presence here highlights Taiwan's calls for more democracy
in China, as well as the sensitive relationship between Taipei and
Beijing, which split politically amid civil war in 1949.
	   The Nationalists say Taiwan's peaceful transition to democracy
over the last decade should be a model for China, and say
reunification between the sides can only happen after China
democratizes.
	   Wei will also meet heads of the opposition New Party, which
backs reunification with China, and the Democratic Progressive
Party, which calls for Taiwan's formal and permanent independence
from China.
	   Wei, who was released from a Chinese prison after 18 years in
prison off-and-on, is visiting at the invitation of the private
World League for Freedom and Democracy.

Russia says stance on Iraq shouldn't affect loan prospects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's opposition to U.S. air strikes in Iraq
shouldn't harm Russia's prospects for attracting international
loans, a senior official said Monday.
	   ``Russia's tough stance is justified,'' First Deputy Premier
Yuri Maslyukov was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies. ``It
emphasizes the significance of the country, and this toughness will
serve as yet another positive reason for offering us a loan.''
	   Russia has long opposed the use of force against Iraq, and said
the recent air strikes only complicated any settlement in the
long-running confrontation between the Arab nation and United
Nations over weapons inspectors.
	   Russia recalled its ambassadors from the United States and
Britain to protest the bombings, which ended over the weekend after
four days.
	   Citing a Foreign Ministry source, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported Monday that Russia would soon send Ambassador Yuli
Vorontsov back to Washington.
	   The report gave no additional details.
	   With Russia in the throes of an economic crisis, it badly needs
international loans. But the IMF and others have frozen
disbursements since the country's economic crisis hit in August.
	   The United States has the power to block IMF loans, but has
given no indication that it would object to giving money to Russia
because of its position on Iraq.
	   The Russians have long-standing relations with Iraq and want to
help rebuild the country's oil industry when U.N. sanctions are
lifted. The sanctions were imposed following Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.

Weekend clashes taper off, calm restored in Brazzaville
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ Following weekend clashes
between government forces and a rebel militia, relative calm was
restored Monday to this central African country's already battered
capital.
	   Thousands of people fled from the city's southern outskirts to
avoid fighting that left as many as 110 people dead. Although the
hostilities tapered off by Sunday and the area remained quiet on
Monday, few people ventured home.
	   Electricity and fresh water supplies were cut off to the whole
of the capital, which last year was the scene of a brutal civil war
between factional forces loyal to President Denis Sassou-Nguesso
and his adversary, then head of state Pascal Lissouba.
	   The latest fighting is a throwback to the rebellion last year
that put Sassou-Nguesso in power. This time, Sassou-Nguesso's
government forces are battling the outlawed ``Ninja'' militia force
loyal to former prime minister, Bernard Kolelas _ a sometime ally
of Lissouba.
	   Sassou-Nguesso, the Republic of Congo's longtime Marxist
dictator, was ousted in the country's first multi-party elections
in 1992. Espousing capitalist reforms, he returned to power last
year with the help of a private army, nicknamed the ``Cobras.''
	   Although until recently, the Republic of Congo had remained
stable since the end of the war more than a year ago,
Sassou-Nguesso's enemies have not disappeared.
	   The weekend fighting in Brazzaville follows a number of covert
attacks on civilian and military targets in the Republic of Congo's
southwestern Pool region.
	   In Brazzaville, offices and shops remained Monday closed for
fear of looting.
	   Automatic and heavy weapons fire rocked Brazzaville on Saturday
as government forces worked to drive an outlawed militia force from
the area.
	   Doctors and aid workers were warning of health risks for the
large number of internally displaced people from Brazzaville's
south suburbs.
	   State-controlled Voice of the People television in neighboring
Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly
Zaire, said as many as 8,000 people had fled their homes in
Brazzaville over the weekend.

	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Scores of riot police were deployed
around the American and British embassies in Damascus on Monday,
two days after demonstrators attacked the missions to protest
military strikes against Iraq.
	   The Syrian Foreign Ministry on Sunday expressed regret over the
attacks and pledged to upgrade security at diplomatic missions and
international organizations.
	   More than 1,000 demonstrators, mostly students, attacked the
U.S. and British embassies and their cultural institutes Saturday
to protest U.S. and British airstrikes on Iraq.
	   The bombardment was called off Saturday.
	   The British ambassador to Damascus, Basil Eastwood, protested to
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa late Saturday for the
attack on the British Embassy and British Council.
	   According to a British Embassy statement, al-Sharaa offered a
``full apology and stressed that there will be suitable protection
for all British buildings and nationals.''

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ With a quick trial and 13-year sentence for
veteran dissident Xu Wenli, Chinese authorities moved to silence a
moderate voice and skillful organizer from China's small dissident
community.
	   Xu will now return to a prison system he knows from its darkest
side. Convicted of subversion once before _ in 1982 _ Xu spent 12
years in prison, much of it in solitary confinement. For 3 1-2
years, he lived in a concrete, windowless box so small he could not
stand up.
	   ``They are putting an innocent man in jail,'' his daughter, Xu
Jin, said. ``They put him in jail during his golden age for 12
years. Once again, he's facing that prospect and he's not that
young anymore. His health is not that good.''
	   Going with Xu into China prisons will be Wang Youcai, a student
leader in the 1989 democracy movement who spent two years in
prison. He was sentenced to 11 years in prison Monday.
	   Both Xu and Wang were trying to break communist China's 49-year
ban on opposition politics by organizing other dissidents to
register the China Democracy Party.
	   Unlike Wang, who began his activism as a Beijing University
student in the relatively better-off 1980s, Xu did a stint in the
People's Liberation Army and then worked as an electrician in the
1970s.
	   Xu united dissidents publishing underground journals to form one
of the most influential periodicals of the Democracy Wall movement
in 1978.
	   At his one-day trial in 1982, Xu was sentenced to 15 years in
prison. Two years later, he secretly wrote an account of his arrest
and trial that was smuggled out of prison and shocked a West still
in the first optimistic embrace of a changing China.
	   His account apparently infuriated prison officials, and he was
moved into a damp vault with a cement floor, a mat for a bed, a
bucket for a toilet and a lightbulb that burned night and day, Asia
Watch said in an account in 1993.
	   He ate cornmeal buns, salt and water. He was never allowed out
for 3 1-2 years. Family visits were canceled.
	   Afterward he remained in solitary confinement in a small cell
with no heating. Neighboring cells held prisoners who were sick
with tuberculosis and other diseases, the Asia Watch report added.
	   In 1991, two year's before his release, his wife's appeal to
prison authorities to let her send him a radio or television was
turned down. He was not even allowed a photograph of his wife and
daughter in the cell.
	   When he became politically active again after his parole ended
last year, Xu seemed neither embittered nor broken. He turned to
writing once again about democracy and China's future and openly
organizing other dissidents.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ No. 3 Japanese automaker Honda said Monday it is
considering returning to Formula One racing in 2000, sending it
back to the world circuit after it left six years ago because of
rising costs.
	   ``We have started test runs for a car in preparation for
participation in the Formula One, possibly (in) 2000,'' said
Hiroyuki Yoshino, president of Honda Motor, at a news conference in
Tokyo.
	   Yoshino said Honda has designed and built a prototype car with
its own engine and tested it on the outskirts of Milan, Italy, on
Dec. 15.
	   He declined to comment on the car's performance, but said Honda
will continue with more testing next year.
	   Honda first entered Formula One competition in 1964 but pulled
out four years later. After returning in 1984, Honda supplied
engines to McLaren and Williams, who with the Japanese engines won
which won every constructors' and drivers title from 1986 to 1991.

Famed monk ready for beatification
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ The Vatican certified Monday a miracle
attributed to the intercession of Padre Pio, clearing the way for
the beatification of the Capuchin monk.
	   No date was announced for the beatification -- the last step
before possible sainthood -- but Italian media said the ceremony
may take place in May.
	   The Italian monk, who died in 1968, has followers around the
world who credit him supernatural powers. His tomb in southern
Italy attracts millions of visitors a year.
	   In a ceremony Monday attended by Pope John Paul II, the Vatican
said the recovery of a Salerno woman who prayed to Padre Pio was
``extraordinary.'' She was hospitalized after a lymph vessel burst
but recovered in a few days, according to the Vatican
documentation.
	   In 1997, the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints
officially recognized the virtuous qualities of Padre Pio, making
the monk ``venerable'' in the eyes of the Roman Catholic church.
	   Born Francesco Forgione in 1887, he was a military chaplain
during World War I. After the war, he returned to his monastery in
Puglia, and quickly developed a reputation for exceptional
holiness.
	   He gained fame in 1918 when he began to bleed from his hands,
feet and side -- the first priest in centuries to show signs of the
stigmata.

Cambodian opposition calls for accounting of timber deals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Flexing muscle in its new role as
Cambodia's parliamentary opposition, the party of former finance
minister Sam Rainsy called Monday for an inquiry into logging deals
signed by the Cambodian government.
	   In letters to National Assembly President Prince Norodom
Ranariddh and his deputy, Heng Samrin, the 15 legislators of the
Sam Rainsy Party asked for the government to reveal details of
contracts signed with timber firms and the proceeds the government
has received in taxes.
	   According to the Cambodian constitution, one tenth of the
122-seat National Assembly can call for written or verbal
explanations from Cabinet ministers on the government's affairs.
	   Logging and deforestation have been rampant in Cambodia in
recent years, mostly the result of under-the-table deals cemented
by powerful politicians and the military that have denied the
national treasury sorely needed budget money.
	   The practice has frustrated foreign aid donors that provided
Cambodia with about half of its annual budget until strongman Hun
Sen ousted Ranariddh as his co-prime minister in a July 1997 coup
d'etat.
	   The two leaders settled their differences last month and formed
a new coalition government with Hun Sen as prime minister, paving
the way for a return of non-humanitarian aid.
	   Hun Sen has promised tough initiatives to stamp out illegal
logging and a handful of timber seizures have been publicized in
recent months, including the televised burning of 11 confiscated
logging trucks.
	   Environmentalists have remained skeptical. The London-based
organization Global Witness reported this month that log traffic
along Cambodia's borders does not appear to have abated.
	   The Sam Rainsy Party appealed for the government to prove it was
serious in efforts to investiagate officials suspected of
involvement in illegal logging before donor organizations meet
early next year in Tokyo to discuss aid.

Liberals capture majority of votes in St. Petersburg elections

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Liberal candidates capitalized on
voter anger over lawlessness in St. Petersburg, and won 24 of 50
seats in city council elections, according to preliminary results
Monday.
	   St. Petersburg, the country's second-largest city after Moscow,
has long had liberal leanings, though liberal groups nationwide
have been in disarray recently.
	   The election was seen as a test of their strength, and the poll
attracted nationwide attention after a leading liberal politician
was killed in the city last month.
	   Three liberal parties captured a total of 24 seats, giving them
the largest share. Communist groups took five seats and
independents and smaller parties took the remaining 21, according
to the City Electoral Commission.
	   The largest single bloc was the liberal group led by Yuri
Boldyrev, which won 15 seats. Some of the independents were
expected to side with liberals as well.
	   Still, observers said the vote was not the sweeping victory for
liberals that some had expected.
	   ``Is this a victory for democracy? It's not that
straightforward,'' said said Leonid Kesselman, a sociologist and
political columnist.
	   Sunday's vote was a runoff election after only six of the 50
seats were filled in the first round of voting earlier this month.
Sunday's turnout of about 32 percent was marred by reports of
election violations.
	   Observers said there were cases of vote buying and busing
pensioners to the election sites. Some losers immediately demanded
recounts.
	   ``These elections were trash,'' said taxi driver Oleg Kuznetsov.
``Somebody came to my house and offered me 35 rubles (dlrs 1.67) to
vote for somebody else, I forget who, I was so insulted.''
	   The new deputies will enter a city council that grants its
members a much stronger voice in local affairs than similar bodies
elsewhere in Russia.
	   The campaign leading up to the election was marred by intrigue
and violence. Attackers beat one candidate with metal rods, and the
windows of a city council member's apartment were shot out.
	   The most shocking event, however, was the death of Galina
Starovoitova, one of the country's leading liberal politicians. She
was killed by unidentified gunmen on Nov. 20 outside her St.
Petersburg apartment.
	   Starovoitova's death galvanized St. Petersburg's 3.7 million
voters, who seemed fed up with the city's crime and corruption, and
its poor economic performance.

Serb policeman reported killed in northern Kosovo town

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Albanian report from Podujevo, several hundred
Serbs attending Kosovo Polje rally.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Serb policeman was reported killed
and a woman wounded Monday in a tense northern Kosovo town,
ushering in another week of bloodshed that threatens to plunge the
province back into all-out war.
	   The Serb-run Media Center reported 52-year-old Milic Jovic was
shot and wounded by unknown assailants using automatic weapons in
Podujevo early Monday. He died en route to the hospital. A woman
who was accompanying Jovic was wounded in the leg, the center said.
	   The report could not be independently confirmed.
	   Podujevo is overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian town some 40
kilometers (25 miles) north of Pristina, close to central Serbia.
Tensions there have grown in past weeks, as local Serbs complained
of a growing guerrilla presence and demanded a state action against
them.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources in Podujevo Monday said a police sweep
followed the morning shooting. The Kosovo Information Center, close
to the Albanian leadership, said the town was blocked as Serb
police brought in reinforcements. Sporadic shooting could be heard
from an area northeast of the town, the center said.
	   Jovic's killing is the latest in a series of setbacks for
Kosovo's fragile truce between Serb security forces and the ethnic
Albanian separatist rebels. It is certain to enrage the Serbs,
already furious over last week's killings of six Serb youths and a
prominent Serb official.
	   The incident came a day after the KLA buried 33 fighters killed
last week in a border clash with the Yugoslav army. Some 5,000
Kosovo Albanians attended the funeral, pledging to continue their
battle against the Serb state.
	   The attack on Jovic also heightens fears that violence in Kosovo
is moving from the rugged countryside to the towns. The six youths
were killed in a bar in the western town of Pec and the official
found dead last week was deputy major Kosovo Polje, a Serb
stronghold outside Pristina.
	   The KLA has denied responsibility for the killings, but Serbian
officials and media blame the KLA.
	   Several hundred Serbs staged a rally in Kosovo Polje Monday
demanding protection against what they say is increasing danger
from the Albanians.
	   The angry crowd booed and jeered as Serbia's interior minister
Vlajko Stojiljkovic declared ``terrorism has been defeated'' and
``only gangs of criminals are left out in the field.''
	   The surge in tensions and incidents in Kosovo could disrupt a
shaky cease fire agreed to in October, and lead to resumption of
large-scale fighting. The previous Serb crackdown launched last
February claimed over 1,000 lives and forced some 300,000 people
from their homes.
	   Attempts at finding a peaceful solution for Kosovo have failed
so far with the two sides' positions still very much apart. Ethnic
Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the population, want
independence while Serbia refuses to give up control over its
southern province.
	   The KLA funeral Sunday was also aimed at presenting the rebels
as a formidable force. A special, elite KLA unit, dressed in black
uniforms, fired volleys of semi-automatic fire into the air in a
final salute as the simple wooden caskets were lowered into the
frozen ground on a ridge renamed ``Heroes' Graves'' about 30
kilometers (20 miles) west of Kosovo's capital Pristina.
	   ``We all together took the oath for the same cause,'' a KLA
commander, Saban Shala, said in a eulogy. ``And we promise you that
we will continue our fighting for freedom.''

UN Humanitarian program set back, 260,000 tons of rice destroyed

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.S. and British airstrikes disrupted the
distribution of supplies under the U.N.-approved oil-for-food
program, but officials said Monday they planned to return to Iraq
after being evacuated last week.
	   Food warehouses were destroyed in the attacks, and the
evacuation of U.N. workers prior to the airstrikes left only
essential personnel in place to administer the program, U.N.
Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq Hans von Sponeck told The
Associated Press.
	   ``Our program has been severely curtailed,'' he said.
	   More than 100 U.N. aid workers who left Iraq last Friday _ along
with about 30 ``essential staff'' who stayed in Baghdad _ supervise
the oil-for-food program.
	   U.N. officials said they would return to Iraq on Tuesday.
	   The program is an exception to U.N. sanctions imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, allowing the sale of limited
quantities of oil to buy needed food and medicine for the country's
22 million people.
	   Oil continued to flow during the bombardment, both U.N. and
Iraqi officials said. But the arrival of food was disrupted because
monitors were not in place.
	   Sponeck also said a warehouse with 260,000 tons of rice that was
destroyed in the attacks had been located in the city of Tikrit,
the home town of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein 170 kilometers (106
miles) north of Baghdad.
	   Also Monday, the U.N. Children's Fund, UNICEF, said in a
statement that it has drawn up plans to repair some of the
buildings in Baghdad that were damaged during the airstrikes.
	   It said two hospitals in Baghdad sustained damage as well as a
``few primary schools.''
	   U.N. teams had been sent to the southern city of Basra, which
also was hit, ``to make further assessment of damage,'' the
statement said.
	   The United Nations monitors Iraq's distribution of food and
medicine in the central and southern areas of the country.
	   In Iraq's north, which is dominated by ethnic Kurds, the United
Nations has sole responsibility. U.N. workers were not evacuated
from the north during the latest military action.
	   Von Sponeck said his contacts with Iraqi officials, including
Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, continued as usual.
	   ``We discuss all kinds of problems,'' he said. ``I don't detect
any difference.''

Palestinians reject Israel's conditions on accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANA BUDEIRI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinians on Monday angrily rejected
conditions set by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for
moving ahead with implementation of the 2-month old peace accord.
	   Netanyahu's Cabinet on Sunday approved a tough series of
conditions for resuming Israel's already-suspended compliance with
the accords.
	   The prime minister says the holdup is justified because
Palestinians are failing to meet their own obligations _ a
contention the Palestinians hotly contest.
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the Palestinians
had notified Israel of their position in a letter to Cabinet
Secretary Danny Naveh.
	   ``We responded ... by utterly rejecting the conditions set forth
by the Israeli government,'' Erekat said. ``We consider these
conditions a flagrant violation'' of the U.S.-brokered Wye River
accord.
	   The Israeli conditions, published by Netanyahu's office, include
the collection of illegally held weapons; a renunciation by the
Palestinian leadership of the intention to unilaterally declare
independence by May and of claims to make Jerusalem its capital;
recognition that Israel never promised to release prisoners jailed
for killing and a stop to violence and incitement to violence.
	   Erekat also said regardless of whether Israeli lawmakers agree
later Monday to hold early elections, Israel should implement the
accord as promised. He called prospects for paralysis of the peace
process due to Israel's political turmoil ``alarming.''
	   ``In case of new elections, life will go on in Israel in this
interim phase _ the only hanging issue will be that of the peace
accord,'' he said.
	   Erekat said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had asked U.S.
President Bill Clinton for ``immediate and active intervention'' to
move the process forward.

Bierhoff to miss Germany's U.S. Tour
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Captain Oliver Bierhoff will miss
Germany's United States tour in February because of club
commitments in Italy, coach Erich Ribbeck said Monday.
	   During their 10-day trip to Florida, the Germans will play the
United States on Feb. 6 in Jacksonville and Colombia on Feb. 9 in
Miami.
	   Bierhoff, Germany's top striker who became captain after this
summer's World Cup, and defensive midfielder Joerg Heinrich are
unavailable because their Italian clubs clash in a top Serie A game
while the German team is in the United States. Bierhoff plays for
AC Milan, Heinrich for Fiorentina.
	   Ribbeck announced a 26-man squad that will be reduced to 20 or
22 men before the team leaves for Florida.
	   Bayern Munich, the runaway Bundesliga leader, provides the bulk
of the squad, with seven players. But its eccentric midfielder
Mario Basler was dropped.
	   ``I talked to him and I told him why he wasn't coming with us,''
Ribbeck said. ``It doesn't mean that he is out of the team
forever.''
	   Ribbeck declined to name his reasons for dropping Basler, whose
late-night escapades make regular headlines in Germany.
	   Two rookies have been invited, 31-year-old striker Michael
Preetz of Hertha Berlin and midfielder Bernd Schneider.
	   Two others, midfielders Marco Reich and Michael Ballack of
Bundesliga champion Kaiserslautern, have been invited before but
have not played a game yet for Germany.
	   The veteran is Lothar Matthaeus, the 37-year-old Bayern libero
who has 130 national team games.
	   ``Not the youngest but the best should play and Preetz is the
leading German-born striker in the Bundesliga,'' Ribbeck said.
	   With 11 goals, Preetz shares the lead with Brazilian star
Giovane Elber of Bayern Munich and Andrzej Juskowiak, Wolfsburg's
Polish forward.
	   Juergen Klinsmann, Germany's former captain who retired after
the World Cup, will be honored before the game with the United
States in an official farewell ceremony.
	   ---- &QC; 
	   The roster:
	   Goalkeepers: Oliver Kahn (Bayern Munich), Stefan Klos (Borussia
Dortmund), Jens Lehmann (AC Milan).
	   Defenders: Markus Babbel (Bayern Munich), Lothar Matthaeus
(Bayern Munich), Jens Nowotny (Bayer Leverkusen), Marko Rehmer
(Hansa Rostock), Christian Woerns (Paris St-Germain).
	   Midfielders: Michael Ballack (Kaiserslautern), Stefan Beinlich
(Bayer Leverkusen), Dietmar Hamann (Newcastle), Jens Jeremies
(Bayern Munich), Andreas Moeller (Borussia Dortmund), Christian
Nerlinger (Borussia Dortmund), Carsten Ramelow (Bayer Leverkusen),
Marco Reich (Kaiserslautern), Lars Ricken (Borussia Dortmund),
Bernd Schneider (Eintracht Frankfurt), Thomas Strunz (Bayern
Munich).
	   Forwards: Marco Bode (Werder Bremen), Carsten Jancker (Bayern
Munich), Ulf Kirsten (Bayer Leverkusen), Olaf Marschall
(Kaiserslautern), Oliver Neuville (Hansa Rostock), Michael Preetz
(Hertha Berlin), Alexander Zickler (Bayern Munich).

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.S. and British airstrikes disrupted the
distribution of supplies under the U.N.-approved oil-for-food
program, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Iraq said Monday.
	   The coordinator, Hans von Sponeck, also confirmed an earlier
report that a U.N. warehouse full of rice was destroyed and said it
was in the city of Tikrit.
	   Tikrit, the home town of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, is 170
kilometers (106 miles) north of Baghdad.
	   The warehouse, managed by the U.N. World Food Program, held
260,000 tons of rice.
	   Von Sponeck told Associated Press Television News that ``our
program has been severely curtailed.''
	   More than 100 U.N. aid workers were evacuated last Friday to the
Jordanian capital Amman, but U.N. officials said they would return
to Iraq on Tuesday.
	   Those workers _ along with about 30 ``essential staff'' who
stayed in Baghdad _ supervise the oil-for-food program.
	   The program, which is an exception to U.N. sanctions imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, allows Iraq to sell limited
quantities of oil to buy needed food and medicine for its 22

Rwandan Hutu cabinet minister resigns, flees country
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ A Rwandan Hutu cabinet minister has
resigned and fled the country, apparently after members of her
family were arrested on suspicion of aiding Hutu rebels, the weekly
New Times reported Monday.
	   Beatrice Sebatware-Panda, minister of state for internal
affairs, communal development and resettlement, has been missing
since Dec. 4 when she wrote a resignation letter to President
Pasteur Bizimungu before flying to Nairobi, Kenya, the private
newspaper quoted Minister of Interior Sheikh Abdulkarim Harerimana
as saying.
	   Harerimana said Sebatware, daughter of a former Hutu police
official in Kigali who is sought by the government for taking part
in the 1994 genocide, fled after the arrest of her brothers on
suspicion of collaborating with Hutu rebels fighting in
northwestern Rwanda.
	   On Monday, the office of the prime minister refused to comment
on the incident.
	   More than 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus
were slaughtered by Hutu soldiers and militiamen before Tutsi-led
rebels took power and stopped the killing in July 1994.
	   The rebels formed a government of national unity including both
Tutsis and Hutus.
	   Since then, at least three Hutu ministers, including former
Prime Minister Faustin Twagiramungu, have resigned and formed a
Hutu opposition in exile, accusing the government of sidelining the
majority Hutu population.
	   Hutus make up about 65 percent of Rwanda's estimated population
of 7.7 million, Tutsis 14 percent.
	   Former Interior Minister Seth Sendashonga was gunned down in
Nairobi earlier this year. Three men were charged with the murder.
The Rwandan government has denied responsibility for the killing.
	   Both the president and prime minister of Rwanda are Hutus.
	   Sebatware returned to Rwanda along with more than a million Hutu
refugees in 1996. She was appointed minister on March 28, 1997.
	   Her father, whose name is on a government most-wanted list of
genocide perpetrators, is reported to be in exile in either Kenya
or Belgium.
	   ``I am disappointed with her action,'' Patrick Mazimhaka, a
minister in Bizimungu's office, said. ``She left the country
without telling us. If there were any grievances, she should have
discussed them with us.''
	   Together with the only other woman in the cabinet, Minister of
Family and Women's Affairs Aloyise Inyumba, Sebatware had been
drafting a program for the resettlement of more than 600,000 Hutus
from army-protected camps to which they had fled to escape attacks
by Hutu rebels.

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Prosecutors on Monday dropped murder
charges against a nurse in the deaths of 22 patients at a home for
the elderly, but left open the possibility she could be tried on
other charges.
	   The nurse was charged in October 1997, shocking a country that
prides itself on its extensive social services and good medical
care. At the time, police said the nurse also was suspected of
embezzling 384,000 kroner (dlrs 60,000) from the victims.
	   The 22 victims, aged 65 to 97, died after being given doses of a
morphine-based drug while in the care of the Plejebo nursing home
in downtown Copenhagen. The deaths occurred between August 1994 and
January 1997.
	   The nurse, whose name cannot be released under court order,
could still face other charges such as theft and embezzlement,
prosecutor Karsten Hjorth said.
	   The nurse was fired from the home in March 1997 after admitting
to minor embezzlement.

South African all-rounder joins Welsh county
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ South African all-rounder Jacques Kallis
has replaced Pakistan fast bowler Waqar Younis as Glamorgan's
overseas player for 1999.
	   Although the Western Province player will not be available
during the five week-long World Cup in May and June during the
first half of the county championship, Glamorgan sees Kallis as a
great asset. He will team up with the county's Western Province
coach, Duncan Fletcher.
	   Glamorgan captain Matthew Maynard said he has no doubts about
the value of signing Kallis, who spent the 1997 season with
Middlesex.
	   ``Magnificent _ just about the best we could have made,''
Maynard said. ``Jacques has proved in the last 18 months or so just
what a good all-round cricketer he is _ be it Test matches or
one-day internationals _ and he is still only 24 years old.
	   ``With Tony Cottey and Gary Butcher having left, we have moved
quickly to strengthen the side, and I have no doubt at all that
Jacques will make a significant impact with us.''
	   Maynard said he wasn't worried that Kallis might not be
available for a long period if South Africa has a good run in the
World Cup.
	   ``I'm not too concerned,'' he said. ``We know that even if South
Africa make the final he is going to be available to play in
two-thirds of our matches _ perhaps more _ and such is his talent
and commitment he is bound to make a massive contribution.''

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Italy's industry minister sought Monday to
ease strained trade relations with Turkey over Rome's refusal to
extradite a Kurdish rebel leader.
	   Italian companies have lost an estimated dlrs 200 million as
Turkish businesses have imposed an unofficial boycott on Italian
goods while some Turks have reportedly refused to buy Italian
products.
	   ``We are seeking a way to overcome this problem,'' Pierluigi
Bersani, the industry minister, told reporters after meeting with
his Turkish counterpart Yalim Erez. ``We hope that after this
meeting the hurdles that have affected the economic relations will
be solved.''
	   The government insists the boycott is a spontaneous popular
expression of public outrage at Italy's failure to extradite
Abdullah Ocalan, who heads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK.
Italy said he it cannot extradite Ocalan to Turkey because he faces
a possible death sentence on terrorism charges.
	   ``The Turkish government has made no decision to boycott Italian
goods although we have the right to do so in government
procurements,'' Erez said. ``On the contrary, we want to boost our
economic ties with Italy.''
	   Erez said Turkish and Italian business representatives and union
leaders will meet in the coming days to seek a solution.
	   ``We have received letters from hundreds of Italian companies
that they were in trouble,'' Bersani said. ``Our aim is to solve
this problem within the limits of the Italian laws while
considering the feelings of the Turkish people.''.
	   Erez said Bersani had assured him that Italy would not grant
political asylum to Ocalan and was considering whether to seek his
trial in Europe or expell him to a third country.
	   ``If they think about the option of sending him to Turkey, we
can give them every kind of assurance,'' Erez said, referring to a
draft bill to lift the death penalty.
	   Bersani's visit came days before the Defense Ministry is due to
announce a list of companies to be chosen for a dlrs 4 billion
attack helicopter project.
	   The daily Milliyet said Monday that the Italian helicopter
manufacturer Augusta has been sidestepped in the tender to produce
145 attack helicopters for the Turkish military.

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ In a hearing broadcast on nationwide
television, Philippine senators Monday grilled the widow of
dictator Ferdinand Marcos on her claims that her husband owned much
of the Philippines, but she dodged most questions.
	   Mrs. Marcos said her lawyers advised her to keep silent to
prevent jeopardizing her chances in more than 400 pending court
cases the government has filed to retrieve the Marcoses' alleged
illegally obtained wealth.
	   Dressed elegantly in orange and wearing pearl and gold jewelry,
Mrs. Marcos, 69, said her husband was not a thief and amassed his
fortune through gold trading. She declined to give other details.
	   Sen. Aquilino Pimentel, who headed a joint committee that
questioned the flamboyant former first lady, ordered Mrs. Marcos to
explain by Jan. 5 why she refused to answer questions from the
lawmakers.
	   Pimentel, a former southern Philippine city mayor jailed by
Marcos, said he would cite Mrs. Marcos for contempt if she would
not do so.
	   The senate hearing was broadcast live by a cable television
company, allowing many Filipinos to see for the first time Mrs.
Marcos being questioned about her family's wealth.
	   The Philippine Daily Inquirer, one of the country's leading
newspapers, early this month ran a series of articles in which Mrs.
Marcos was quoted as having said her family owns much of the
Philippines.
	   ``We practically own everything in the Philippines,'' Mrs.
Marcos was quoted as saying by the Inquirer.
	   Mrs. Marcos and her lawyers reportedly are planning to sue to
recover at least 500 billion pesos (dlrs 12.65 billion) in equity
in more than 100 top Philippine corporations that were allegedly
entrusted by Marcos to his associates, who now refuse to return
them to Marcos' heirs.
	   In the hearing, Mrs. Marcos said she agreed to appear in the
senate to seek the lawmakers' help in recovering her husband's
assets, suggesting the late president had wanted these turned over
to the government for the benefit of all Filipinos.
	   Mrs. Marcos refused to identify the corporations and assets or
the trustees used by her husband as fronts.
	   ``With the privilege she often invoked, we don't really get the
clear picture,'' said Senate President Marcelo Fernan.
	   Mrs. Marcos acknowledged providing information about her late
husband's fortune to Inquirer reporter Christine Herrera but said
she has not authorized these to be published.
	   In an initial hearing by the senators Friday, Herrera gave
copies of her taped interviews with Mrs. Marcos to the lawmakers.
	   Ms. Herrera also showed a transcript of her interview with Mrs.
Marcos in which the former first lady said that a senior member of
the President Joseph Estrada's Cabinet, Executive Secretary Ronaldo
Zamora, held shares for the Marcos family in Security Bank, which
has been sequestered by the government.
	   Zamora and Mrs. Marcos, however, both denied the claim.
	   At one point in the Senate hearing, Mrs. Marcos' voice cracked
and she seemed on the verge of tears when senators asked her to
appear in another hearing set either next week or early January.
	   Mrs. Marcos begged off, citing the Christmas holidays and a plan
to travel to the United States next month for an eye treatment. ``I
do hope you'll have mercy on a widow that has gone through a lot
already,'' she told the lawmakers.
	   The government has accused the Marcoses of illegally enriching
themselves during his 20-year rule.
	   The government has put claims on Marcos' wealth, including about
dlrs 570 million in Swiss deposits now held in an escrow account in
a Philippine bank.
	   The Swiss accounts are also being claimed by 9,539 Filipinos who
won a class action suit for human rights violations against the
Marcos estate and were awarded dlrs 2 billion in damages.
	   Marcos was ousted in a popular revolt in 1986 and died in exile
in Hawaii three years later. He had denied any wrongdoing.

Parliamentary showdown set over Netanyahu's peace policies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 3-4 with behind-the-scenes maneuvering over
which measures to be voted on, drops radio attribution on Shahak's
intentions. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's fractious
ruling coalition appeared poised Monday to finally crack apart,
ushering in what could be weeks or even months of paralysis on the
Israeli-Palestinian peace front.
	   On Monday, Israel's parliament prepared to a series of measures
that _ separately or together _ were seen as a broad referendum on
the peace process.
	   Measures that may come up for a vote include at least one
no-confidence motion against Netanyahu's government, a possible
measure to set early elections, along with what could be a separate
vote by lawmakers on Netanyahu's latest stance toward the
Palestinians.
	   But by mid-afternoon, soon before the scheduled start of the
Knesset session, a frantic flurry of behind-the-scenes dealmaking
and arm-twisting still had not yielded a firm parliamentary agenda.
However, the no-confidence motions were looking less likely to be
put forward.
	   In the two months since the signing of the U.S.-brokered Wye
River land-for-security accords, the prime minister has been under
fire from both supporters and opponents of the peace process _ for
very different reasons.
	   Israel's left accuses Netanyahu of bad faith and foot-dragging,
saying the prime minister never intended to live up to promises
made under the landmark Oslo accords signed by slain Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   Since Netanyahu took office in May 1996, the peace process has
been largely stalled. The signing of the Wye accords on Oct. 23 in
Washington represented a dramatic break in what had been a 19-month
deadlock.
	   The accord's right-wing opponents, among them Jewish settlers,
have expressed fury at Netanyahu for agreeing to hand over more
West Bank land to the Palestinians in exchange for security steps.
Previously, he had promised to fight any such concessions.
	   Setting the stage for Monday's parliamentary action, Netanyahu's
Cabinet on Sunday approved a tough set of conditions for resuming
Israel's compliance with the Wye accords. Netanyahu said he would
hold a vote to check lawmakers' views of that move.
	   Netanyahu says the conditions _ including a demand that Arafat
renounce his intentions to declare independence by the end of May
are justified because the Palestinians have not met obligations
under the agreement.
	   The Palestinians say they have, and denounce the delays as
unfair and inflammatory.
	   One of several scenarios could unfold in the Knesset later
Monday.
	   A successful no-confidence motion would mean new elections would
be held within 60 days. Even Netanyahu's allies acknowledge he
would likely lose; he holds only a one-seat majority in the
120-seat house, and support from his coalition partners has
crumbled.
	   Another possibility was a passage of a separate measure calling
for early elections _ which Netanyahu himself may support. If it is
approved, the bill would then return to the Knesset law committee
for debate and then back to the floor for two more readings before
becoming law.
	   Alternatively, Netanyahu and the opposition could simply agree
on an election date, expected to be in April. On the eve of the
vote, 67 Knesset members said they would support early elections.
	   Yet another potential move would be Netanyahu's resignation,
which would trigger elections within 60 days. That was considered
unlikely, however.
	   The timetable on early elections _ whether within 60 days or
later _ could be an important consideration because of constraints
faced by a prime potential opponent, Lt. Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak.
	   Shahak, who has been on leave since stepping down as army chief
of staff in July, will announce his retirement from the military
once elections were called.
	   Under law, Shahak would be banned from participating in politics
for 100 days after his departure from the armed forces. But with a
presidential dispensation, that could be shortened to 50 days.
	   Little is known of Shahak's policies. As a soldier, he is
prohibited from expressing an opinion, but his deep involvement in
the peace talks suggests he is a moderate who favors territorial
concessions.
	   Polls have suggested that a centrist bid by Shahak would likely
push Labor Party leader Ehud Barak out of the race in the first
round of voting and lead to a run-off between Netanyahu and Shahak.
	   Barak, whose party began the Israel-Palestinian peace process in
1993, told Israel TV a Shahak bid would be an ``unnecessary
division of strengths.''

Nurse freed from Saudi Arabia found guilty of theft and fraud
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUNDEE, Scotland (AP) _ A British nurse convicted in Saudi
Arabia of being an accessory to murder in the death of an
Australian colleague was found guilty Monday of stealing money from
a dying elderly patient in Scotland.
	   Lucille McLauchlan _ who was freed earlier this year along with
another British nurse as an act of clemency by King Fahd _ was
convicted of stealing the money while working at Dundee's Kings
Cross Hospital in 1996 and of forging job references.
	   She also was found guilty of handling a stolen bank card, but
was acquitted of stealing the card.
	   All the offenses occurred before Ms. McLauchlan went to Saudi
Arabia.
	   Ms. McLauchlan, 33, was convicted with nurse Deborah Parry in
the 1996 murder of colleague Yvonne Gilford, who was stabbed,
suffocated and beaten in her room at a Saudi hospital where all
three women worked.
	   The two women were released by King Fahd in May after spending
17 months in jail. Both have denied the charge and said their
confessions were extracted only through brutal treatment by Saudi
authorities.
	   Though Ms. McLauchlan denied any connection with the Scotland
thefts, she was unable to explain a security videotape showing her
next to a cash machine at a Dundee bank at which she did not have
an account.
	   Ms. McLauchlan showed no emotion when the verdicts were read
Monday and refused to speak to reporters as she left the court.
	   The judge, Alastair Stewart, deferred sentencing until Jan. 18.

Decapitated heads of hostages to be returned in Moscow

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechen officials plan to travel to Moscow to turn
over the severed heads of four Westerners found earlier this month
in the breakaway Russian republic, Chechnya's presidential
spokesman said Monday.
	   The Chechens were expected in Moscow on Tuesday and will give
the remains to the British and New Zealand embassies, said Chechen
presidential spokesman Mairbek Vachagayev, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The victims _ Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi
of Britain and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were abducted Oct. 3 in
Chechnya, where they were installing a cellular phone system.
	   Their heads were found by a roadside Dec. 8. Authorities still
have not found their bodies.
	   ``I've had some indirect contact which suggests that the remains
will be transported out (of Chechnya) tomorrow, but have not had
direct contact confirming the report,'' New Zealand Ambassador John
Larkindale told The Associated Press.
	   ``I certainly hope the report is true. We want to repatriate the
remains as soon as possible,'' he said.
	   The killers remain at large. Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov
has accused a regional warlord linked to past kidnappings with the
beheadings.
	   Chechnya has been plagued by violence and kidnappings for ransom
since its 1994-96 independence war with Russia. More than 100
people are still thought to be in captivity there.
	   Maskhadov, unable to control the rising crime wave, recently
imposed a state of emergency and promised to crack down on armed
bandits in the region.

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ More than 1,000 bottles of wine,
champagne and cognac belonging to former Communist dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu's were sold Monday for about dlrs 15 a bottle.
	   A Romanian hotel chain paid about 180 million lei (dlrs 17,000)
for 1,140 bottles of Ceausescu's wines, which he received as
presents during his 25-year-rule.
	   The vintage tipples will go on sale at three company hotels in
Transylvania and Bucharest, ``so that anyone can drink the former
president's wine,'' Livia Sinescu, deputy director of Savion S.A.,
said by telephone.
	   The state-run company Bucur S.A., which organized the auction
said it was ``fairly satisfied'' with the sale. The starting price
was 35 million lei (dlrs 3,334). The proceeds will go to a senior
citizens home.
	   Most of the wines come from Romanian vineyards. Others were
given to Ceausescu by other Communist leaders. The oldest bottles
come from the Tirnave vineyard in eastern Romania and date to 1918.
	   Savion outbid five other Romanian companies to buy the
collection. Each bottle is sealed with a gold ribbon, bearing an
attached card reading ``Ceausescu's family residence.''
	   Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were executed in December 1989
after a summary trial. The couple lived in the lap of luxury while
most Romanians languished in deep poverty _ both fascinating and
repelling many Romanians.
	   The government plans to include overnight stays in dozens of the
couple's marble and gold-plated villas and palaces as part of a
luxury travel package. Ceausescu's cars and boats are awaiting a
government decision to be auctioned.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.S. and British airstrikes disrupted the
distribution of supplies under the U.N.-approved oil-for-food
program, but officials said Monday they planned to return to Iraq
after being evacuated last week.
	   Food warehouses were destroyed in the attacks, and the
evacuation of U.N. workers prior to the airstrikes left only
essential personnel in place to administer the program, U.N.
Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq Hans von Sponeck told The
Associated Press.
	   ``Our program has been severely curtailed,'' he said.
	   Sponeck also confirmed an earlier report that a U.N. warehouse
full of rice was destroyed and said it was in the city of Tikrit,
the home town of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, 170 kilometers (106
miles) north of Baghdad.
	   The warehouse, managed by the U.N. World Food Program, held
260,000 tons of rice.
	   More than 100 U.N. aid workers who left Iraq last Friday _ along
with about 30 ``essential staff'' who stayed in Baghdad _ supervise
the oil-for-food program. U.N. officials said they would return to
Iraq on Tuesday.
	   The program is an exception to U.N. sanctions imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, allowing the sale of limited
quantities of oil to buy needed food and medicine for the country's
22 million people.
	   Oil continued to flow during the bombardment, both U.N. and
Iraqi officials said. But the arrival of food was disrupted because
monitors were not in place.
	   Also Monday, the U.N. Children's Fund, UNICEF, said in a
statement that it has drawn up plans to repair some of the
buildings in Baghdad that were damaged during the airstrikes.
	   It said two hospitals in Baghdad sustained damage as well as a
``few primary schools.''
	   U.N. teams had been sent to the southern city of Basra, which
also was hit, ``to make further assessment of damage,'' the
statement said.
	   The United Nations monitors Iraq's distribution of food and
medicine in the central and southern areas of the country.
	   In Iraq's north, which is dominated by ethnic Kurds, the United
Nations has sole responsibility. U.N. workers were not evacuated
from the north during the latest military action.
	   Von Sponeck said his contacts with Iraqi officials, including
Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, continued as usual.
	   ``We discuss all kinds of problems,'' he said. ``I don't detect
any difference.''

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Some 12 million Iranian smokers burn about
20 billion rials (dlrs 6.6 million) every day, the Jomhuri Islami
daily reported Monday.
	   That means about one-fifth of the 60-million population smoke,
the paper added.
	   Smokers spend about 3 billion rials (dlrs 1 million) on matches
alone every day, the paper quoted Abdulhamid Omidvar, deputy head
of the Anti-Smoking Campaign.
	   The actual daily cost of smoking in Iran is about 80 billion
rials (dlrs 26.6 million) if the amount spent on smoking-related
diseases is included, the paper said.
	   In the fiscal year that ended March 1996, government revenues
from cigarettes were 283.9 billion rials (dlrs 94.6 million), while
smokers directly or indirectly cost the government 293 billion
rials (dlrs 97.6 million), Omidvar said.
	   He said this meant that the government was actually subsidizing
smoking in the country.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Trade between Iran and Saudi Arabia is
expected to nearly triple to dlrs 2 billion, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported Monday.
	   A joint economic commission that met in Saudi Arabia recently
agreed to boost trade and cooperation in several sectors, IRNA
quoted a report that appeared over the weekend in the Jiddah-based
Arab News daily.
	   ``We are in the process of acquainting ourselves with regulatory
provisions of the kingdom in order to remove all existing trade and
investment barriers,'' the report quoted Assalloh Asgaroladi,
deputy head of the Iranian chamber of commerce, as saying.
	   He said trade between Iran and Saudi Arabia is expected to reach
7.5 billion Saudi riyals (dlrs 2 billion) next year. Total
bilateral trade between Iran and Saudi Arabia is currently about
2.6 billion Saudi riyals (dlrs 693 million).
	   Officials from the two countries are also discussing the
possibility of setting up a joint Saudi-Iranian bank, the report
said. Riyadh and Tehran are trying to increase the number of
flights between the two Muslim countries to three a week, including
one flight from the holy city of Medina in Saudi Arabia, the report
said.
	   Under consideration is also a plan for Iran Air, Iran's national
carrier, to buy used commercial aircraft from the kingdom, the
report said.
	   Iran's trade minister, Mohammad Shariatmadari, said Saudi Arabia
also wants to employ Iranian doctors and nurses, and to cooperate
with Iran in pharmaceuticals, the report said. ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait is not worried about the effect of the
global economic crisis on its vast empire of state foreign
investments, a senior official said in remarks published Monday.
	   Ali al-Bader, who heads the Kuwait Investment Authority, told
the Arab Times daily that although these investments fluctuate with
the market, safe investments in a balanced portfolio in major
international companies ensure stability.
	   The official did not provide a figure for Kuwait's foreign
portfolio, but it is estimated at around dlrs 40 billion. The
oil-rich state considers it an alternative source of income for
future generations when crude, the mainstay of the economy, runs
out.
	   ``So far we have good results and expect the future to be
better,'' al-Bader told the English-language daily. He did not
elaborate, but he said KIA invests in balanced geographical
portfolios and reviews its investment strategy every three to six
months.
	   ``We don't make radical changes because we're a medium to
long-term investor,'' he explained. ``We're not a trader or a
speculator.''
	   Al-Bader said he was leaving his post at the end of the year
when his contract expires.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Minister of water and energy will visit
Iraq Wednesday to renew Jordan's oil deal with Iraq, a government
official said Monday.
	   Hani Mulqi will ask for an increase of 7 percent in oil supplies
for next year because of the ``natural growth in industrial and
civic consumption,'' said the official, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Jordan's import of Iraqi crude oil and other petroleum products
like fuel oil and diesel were estimated at 4.8 million tons this
year. Since the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq has been exporting more than
75,000 barrels of oil a day to Jordan, part of it at market prices
and the rest at undisclosed concessionary terms.
	   Jordan's oil purchases from Iraq are exempt from U.N. sanctions
imposed on Baghdad following its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
Jordan pays for its oil imports with goods worth dlrs 250 million.

Polish premier seeks better relations with Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BEATA PASEK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek on Monday
called a rift with Israel over a scrapped missile deal ``a
temporary misunderstanding'' and said he wants to improve relations
between the countries.
	   Buzek's government decided Dec. 8 to halt the deal reached last
year to buy Israeli missiles for Poland's Huzar helicopters.
Israeli officials have criticized the move and threatened possible
legal action.
	   It was the latest in a series of disputes between Poland and
Israel this year, including an ongoing argument over crosses
erected on property adjoining the Auschwitz Nazi death camp, now a
museum.
	   Buzek told a news conference he regrets the tarnishing of
Poland's image in Israel and wants to improve relations between the
countries.
	   He cited his government's efforts to include Poles in the annual
March of the Living, held in April at Auschwitz to honor the
flourishing of the Jewish nation over the Nazi attempt to
annihilate it.
	   ``We want to demonstrate what links us,'' Buzek said, recalling
how he and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu walked
side-by-side in this year's march. It was the first time since the
march began in 1988 that non-Jewish Poles took part with thousands
of Jews.
	   On the scrapped missile deal, Buzek said his government waited
for eight months for Israel to field test the NTD missile in
Poland. The tests never happened.
	   ``It is the Polish side which should be disappointed,'' he said,
calling the decision to scrap the deal ``painful.''
	   Following five years of negotiating with several potential
partners, Poland's former leftist government last year awarded the
dlrs 800 million contract to Israel's Rafael and Elbit Systems Ltd.
companies to equip the Huzar helicopters in line with NATO
requirements. The deal required approval from both governments.
	   But Buzek's Solidarity-led government, which took office shortly
after the agreement was signed, criticized the handling of the
tenders by its ex-communist predecessors and demanded the missile
tests.

Security tight at US, British embassies after attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Scores of riot police were deployed
around the U.S. and British embassies in Damascus on Monday, two
days after demonstrators attacked the missions to protest military
strikes against Iraq.
	   The Syrian Foreign Ministry on Monday expressed regret over the
attacks and pledged to upgrade security at diplomatic missions and
international organizations.
	   More than 1,000 demonstrators, mostly students, attacked the
U.S. and British embassies and their cultural institutes Saturday
to protest U.S. and British airstrikes on Iraq.
	   The British ambassador to Damascus, Basil Eastwood, protested to
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa late Saturday for the
attack on the British Embassy and British Council.
	   According to a British Embassy statement, al-Sharaa offered a
``full apology and stressed that there will be suitable protection
for all British buildings and nationals.''

Officials meet to discuss decline in tourism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Ministry of Tourism officials met Monday
with members of the Kenya Tourism Board after the board complained
it was being sidelined in the campaign to win tourists back to
Kenya, a ministry spokeswoman said.
	   The row grew out of the failure of the tourism ministry to pass
on 90 million shillings (dlrs 1.5 million) in operating funds to
the board as well as the ministry's sending of its own people to
Japan to promote tourism. The tourism board was set up to promote
Kenya abroad.
	   Tourism has been Kenya's second most important source of foreign
currency earnings. Arrivals have been dropping steadily since 1990
as competition from South Africa, Seychelles and Mauritius eats
into the market.
	   Meanwhile, Richard Leakey, director of The Kenya Wildlife
Service, and a member of the tourism board, said told the
independent Daily Nation to problem seemed to stem from the attempt
by ministry officials to secure jobs they feel are threatened by
the board's existence.
	   Leakey also called for the abolition of tourist visas, saying
the requirement put off potential visitors because it was
``cumbersome and costly.''

EU to seek WTO panel after US publishes list of sanctioned
</HEADLINE>
products &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union said Monday it will
continue to press for a World Trade Organization solution to its
banana dispute with the United States, even after Washington
unveils a list of EU goods subject to stiff trade sanctions.
	   Nigel Gardner, spokesman for the EU's Foreign Trade Commissioner
Leon Brittan, said the EU will not impose sanctions against
Washington. Instead, the EU will ``move quickly towards
establishing a (WTO) panel.''
	   ``We believe we have a very strong case in the WTO because the
U.S. sanctions are unilateral and therefore are illegal,'' Gardner
said.
	   The United States is expected to publish later Monday a list of
EU products threatened with 100 percent import tariffs in protest
at the EU's banana import regime which Washington feels violates
free trade rules.
	   The U.S. sanctions would only go into effect from March 3, for
procedural reasons, Gardner said.
	   Gardner said the EU Commission will request an arbitration panel
at the WTO to assess the legality of the so-called 301 trade laws
in the United States.
	   These laws allow the U.S. government to determine whether its
trade partners are unfairly protecting their markets, and to impose
retaliatory measures.
	   The EU and the United States often bicker over trade issues and
regularly accuse each other of protectionnism.
	   In this particular case, Washington claims the EU's banana
import system unfairly favors imports from former European
colonies.
	   The United States argues the EU has not done enough to fall in
line with a WTO verdict last year which ruled against the EU's
favorable treatment of a number of African, Caribbean, and Pacific
region countries.
	   The EU says it approved new import regulations to comply with
WTO demands, but the United States and Central and South American
banana producers claim its banana import regime is still
discriminatory.

Balloon team desperately seeking permission for China crossing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with project director's news conference, saying
problem relates to specific course over China &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British tycoon Richard Branson and his balloon
crew skirted the Himalayas on Monday and headed for China _ with no
place to land and no permission to cross the border in their
attempt to circle the globe.
	   With the ICO Global balloon traveling at a steady 50 mph (80
kph), the British government and former Prime Minister Edward Heath
were seeking to persuade Chinese authorities to grant permission to
cross Chinese territory farther north than planned.
	   China had permitted a crossing farther south, but the balloon
was on a more northerly course after being forced to manuever
around both Iraq and a storm, project director Mike Kendrick said.
	   Because of the rugged Himalayan terrain, the balloon had no
place to land before reaching China, Kendrick said.
	   He added that Branson, Chicago millionaire Steve Fossett and
teammate Per Lindstrand of Sweden were steering the balloon as much
to the south as possible.
	   ``The Chinese are very friendly. I've apologized to them,''
Kendrick said. ``It is their airspace. They are entitled to keep us
out. I have no argument with that at all, but we are appealing to
them.''
	   The British government said its ambassador in China was
consulting with Chinese authorities and that the Foreign Office was
speaking to the Chinese Embassy in London.
	   The venture had a similar problem crossing Libya, when
permission was unexpectedly revoked. That problem was resolved on
Saturday just before the balloon entered Libyan airspace.
	   The 270-foot (82-meter) balloon reached the Himalayas after a
quiet day Sunday crossing Turkmenistan in Central Asia and flying
over Afghanistan.
	   Over the weekend, the team had faced fierce thunderstorms and
was forced to pass through a narrow corridor in the Caucasus to
avoid flying over Iraq, Iran and Russia, which had denied
permission to use their airspace.
	   Branson and Lindstrand have already beaten their personal best
of 48 hours in a hot air balloon during a 1991 crossing of the
Pacific.
	   Fossett has made four tries to ring the globe. On the last, he
was lucky to survive when his balloon tore in a thundersstorm,
after traveling 15,000 miles (24,000 kms).
	   Branson has tried, and failed, four times to become the first to
circle the world non-stop in a balloon.
	   Improved technology has been used to make the balloon, including
a canopy of Kevlar of the kind used for bulletproof vests.
	   The crew members estimate the trip could last from eight days to
nearly three weeks. They hope to touch down somewhere in western
Europe at the end of a 24,000-mile (62,000 kms) flight, which will
take them over India, the South China sea, the Pacific and the
United States.
	   The plan is to cross San Francisco on Christmas Day, with a goal
of reaching Europe by New Year's.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and initially had only four refusals _ Iran, Iraq, Russia and North
Korea.
	   At least three other crews have been waiting for favorable
weather to launch balloons _ from Albuquerque, New Mexico, Loves
Park, Illinois, and the Swiss Alps. Yet another team plans to take
off next month from Alice Springs, Australia.

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Prosecutors on Monday dropped murder
charges against a nurse in the deaths of 22 patients at a home for
the elderly, but left open the possibility she could be tried on
other charges.
	   The nurse was charged in October 1997, shocking a country that
prides itself on its extensive social services and good medical
care. At the time, police said the nurse also was suspected of
embezzling 384,000 kroner (dlrs 60,000) from the victims.
	   The 22 victims, aged 65 to 97, died after being given doses of a
morphine-based drug while in the care of the Plejebo nursing home
in downtown Copenhagen. The deaths occurred between August 1994 and
January 1997.
	   The nurse, whose name cannot be released under court order,
could still face other charges such as theft and embezzlement,
prosecutor Karsten Hjorth said.
	   The nurse was fired from the home in March 1997 after admitting
to minor embezzlement.

Andre Dewavrin, member of French secret services, dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Andre Dewavrin, a leading member of the French
resistance and one of Gen. Charles de Gaulle's closest
collaborators during World War II, has died. He was 88.
	   Dewavrin died early Sunday, city authorities in western Paris
where he lived said on Monday.
	   Often referred to by his code name Col. Passy, Dewavrin, was one
of the first French soldiers to join De Gaulle in London after the
fall of France in June 1940.
	   Dewavrin received a superb education at the prestigious Louis Le
Grand high school in Paris followed by studies at the law faculty
of the University of Paris and then the Ecole Polytechnique.
	   He became a professor of fortifications at the military academy
at St. Cyr before participating in the unsuccessful French effort
to resist the German invasion om 1940
	   After making his way to London, he joined De Gaulle's Free
French Forces, setting up the intelligence operations that formed
the basis of France's postwar security forces.
	   After the war, he wrote a number of books on his secret missions
and worked in the private sector.
	   Dewavrin was awarded some of France's highest honors, including
the Legion of Honor, the Military Cross as well as international
military awards for his service during World War II.
	   He was married twice and had three children.
	   Funeral plans were not immediately announced.

NATO commander arrives in Belgrade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO's top commander in Europe, Gen.
Wesley Clark, arrived Monday for a brief meeting with head of the
Serb-led Yugoslav army, the U.S. embassy in Belgrade said.
	   Clark's visit comes amid escalating violence in Serbia's
southern Kosovo province. The American embassy said Clark arrived
to discuss ``technicalities'' with Gen. Lt. Dragoljub Ojdanic, the
newly appointed commander of the Yugoslav army.
	   After Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic signed a deal last
October allowing international monitors in Kosovo, NATO began
deploying 1,800 soldiers in neighboring Macedonia as a backup force
in case the monitors run into trouble.
	   But in a recent interview, Milosevic said any attempt by NATO to
cross into Yugoslavia would be prevented by Yugoslav border troops.
	   Milosevic recently appointed Gen. Ojdanic as army commander,
after firing Gen. Momcilo Perisic, following his criticism of the
Yugoslav leader over several issues.

Major volcano spits ash, briefly closes Mexico City airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The 5,452-meter (3,387-mile) Popocatepetl
volcano erupted with a spew of ash that fell on parts of Mexico
City and briefly forced closure of the Mexican capital's airport,
75 kms (45 miles) to the northeast, on Monday.
	   The ash eruption began at about 10:10 p.m. on Sunday and the
volcano returned to ``relatively low levels of activity'' by
midnight, according to the National Center for the Prevention of
Disasters, which monitors Popocatepetl.
	   A wind toward the northwest caused a light ash fall on the
densely populated Xochimilco and Ixtapalapa districts of
southeastern Mexico City and forced the city's airport to halt
operations from 11:30 p.m. to 1:15 a.m., according to the disaster
center.
	   Three nights earlier, the volcano spewed red-hot rocks, setting
off brushfires on its slopes.
	   Popocatepetl has been spitting vapor, ash and rock
intermittently since December 1994, after lying largely dormant
since 1927. Some 300,000 people live on its slopes and tens of
millions live within view of it.

U.N. diplomat says talks on East Timor are moving forward slowly
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Indonesia-East Timor

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - As a U.N. envoy trotted toward an
Indonesian army helicopter, East Timorese protesters spilled onto
the runway tarmac and shouted their anger at nervous soldiers.
	   Sent to make peace in Indonesian-controlled East Timor, Jamsheed
Marker's recent hasty departure from the troubled territory
signaled how easily tensions there can boil over.
	   Yet Marker, who is visiting Indonesia to promote a U.N.-designed
blueprint for autonomy in the former Portuguese colony, said Monday
that both sides in the bitter conflict were displaying a newfound
taste for compromise.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press, Marker admitted that
a peaceful solution remains distant. But in a big step forward, he
said, many separatist activists were no longer pressing for an
immediate vote on independence.
	   ``They don't want independence tomorrow,'' said Marker, who was
interviewed in a Jakarta hotel suite after his trip to East Timor.
	   In other progress, Indonesia and Portugal will send diplomats to
open ``interest'' sections in each other's capitals next month.
Formal diplomatic relations, however, will not be resumed.
	   Also in January, the two countries are scheduled to embark on a
new round of U.N.-sponsored peace talks in New York.
	   Turmoil has plagued East Timor ever since Indonesian troops
invaded in 1975, unleashing a separatist rebel war and the
resentment of a population pummeled by human rights abuses.
	   Talks were revived earlier this year after the ouster of
authoritarian President Suharto, but differences remain over a
definition of autonomy that would suit all parties.
	   Separatists want it to be transitional, while Indonesia is
offering East Timorese partial control of their affairs in exchange
for international recognition of its sovereignty. Jakarta wants to
handle foreign, defense and financial affairs.
	   Fears are widespread that more unrest in East Timor could derail
the negotiations. On Monday, Marker voiced his concern in a meeting
with East Timor's jailed rebel chief, Xanana Gusmao.
	   ``I said there was a lot of tension in East Timor and that he
and his people ought to do everything they can to reduce it,'' said
Marker, a former Pakistani ambassador to the United Nations.
	   Tempers flared but there was no violence during protests timed
for Marker's weekend trip to Dili, the seaside capital of the
half-island territory of 800,000 people.
	   On Sunday, separatist protesters tore down a fence at the
commercial airport and pushed past soldiers with automatic rifles
as they tried in vain to speak to Marker as he left.
	   During a visit last year, Indonesian soldiers killed two
pro-independence demonstrators outside a hotel where Marker was
staying.
	   Activists have alleged that Indonesia secretly ferried troops
into East Timor in spite of pledges to reduce the number. Marker
said Jakarta had advised him of troop rotations and that U.N. staff
were monitoring the situation.
	   Marker was scheduled to talk with Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie on Tuesday and will leave Indonesia on Wednesday to prepare
for another batch of meetings in the New Year.
	   ``If you ask me... `Do you have a solution?' then the answer is,
`I don't,''' he said. ``But I think there are ways of getting there
and the first thing is to have peace and quiet.''

Cabinet reverses ban on demonstrations, names commander
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon's new government on Monday lifted
a five-year ban on public demonstrations.
	   The Cabinet _ in its first meeting since Prime Minister Salim
Hoss' government won a vote of confidence last week _ also named a
new commander for the country's 65,000-strong army, according to
Information Minister Anwar Khalil.
	   He is Brig. Gen. Michel Suleiman, a Maronite Catholic, who most
recently commanded forces in southern Lebanon.
	   Suleiman, 50, replaces Gen. Emile Lahoud, who was elected by
Parliament as Lebanon's president on Oct. 15.
	   The ban on street protests _ which had often turned violent _
had been in place since September 1993. It was imposed after nine
people were killed in clashes between troops and militant Muslims
protesting the first Palestinian-Israeli peace accord.
	   In 1992, street riots amid an economic crisis forced the
resignation of then-Prime Minister Omar Karami.
	   Khalil said demonstrations would be allowed, but only with
Interior Ministry approval.
	   The Cabinet's decision was ``in line with the government's
policy of protecting freedoms, particularly the freedom of
expression,'' Khalil said.
	   The previous government of Prime Minister Rafik Hariri
repeatedly banned protests and, on occasion, sent the army into the
streets to prevent labor unions from staging protests against
Hariri's economic policies.
	   Suleiman, the new commander, joined the army in 1967. In recent
years, he commanded the estimated 12,000 troops stationed along
Israel's self-styled ``security zone'' in southern Lebanon.
	   The choice respected a tradition that the army commander be a
Maronite under Lebanon's power-sharing formula among its 18
religious sects.
	   Lahoud has pledged to try to do away with some of the
sectarian-based allocation of powers, and one of the appointments
Monday reflected this.
	   The Cabinet appointed army Brig. Jamil Sayyed, a Shiite Muslim,
as head of the General Security Department, which handles foreign
residents, publications and passports. That post traditionally was
held by a Maronite.
	   Brig. Edward Mansour, a Melchite Catholic, was named chief of
the State Security Department, an internal security organ which
normally went to a Shiite. Brig. Hassan Fawaz, a Shiite, was
appointed Mansour's deputy.
	   Abdul-Karim Mansour, a Sunni Muslim, became director general of
the Internal Security Forces, and Brig. Nasser Rahban, a Maronite,
was named commander of the Gendarmerie police force.
	   Col. Raymond Azar, a Maronite, was made chief of Army
Intelligence, the Cabinet announcement said.

	   --
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Ministry of Tourism officials met Monday
with members of the Kenya Tourism Board after the board complained
it was sidelined in the campaign to win back tourists, a ministry
spokeswoman said.
	   The dispute stemmed from the failure of the tourism ministry to
give the board 90 million shillings (dlrs 1.5 million) in operating
funds.
	   The ministry also sent off its own people to Japan to promote
tourism. The tourism board was set up to promote Kenya abroad.
	   Tourism has been Kenya's second most important source of foreign
currency earnings. Arrivals have been dropping steadily since 1990
as competition from South Africa, Seychelles and Mauritius eats
into the market.
	   Richard Leakey, director of The Kenya Wildlife Service and a
member of the tourism board, charged that ministry officials felt
their job security was threatened by the board's work, the Daily
Nation reported.
	   Leakey also called for the abolition of tourist visas, saying
the requirement was ``cumbersome and costly.''
	   ------
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The Ugandan army has denied reports it is
aiding UNITA rebels fighting Angolan government troops, the
government-owned New Vision newspaper said Monday.
	   ``We have no links with UNITA. We see it as another way by
Angola of diverting attention from its increasing internal woes in
face of battlefield losses'' in Congo, a military source who spoke
on condition of anonymity was quoted as saying by Uganda's largest
newspaper.
	   Uganda is supporting rebels against Congolese President Laurent
Kabila. Angolan government troops are backing the Congolese
government.
	   Recent reports said Angola has recalled some of its troops to
put down UNITA rebels in its own country, where serious fighting
has broken out in central Angola.
	   UNITA fighters have been seen wearing Ugandan army uniforms,
according to recent news reports that quoted an Angolan military
source.
	   -----
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Traffic accidents claimed 369
lives since the holiday period began Dec. 1, a 21 percent decrease
over last year.
	   The drop is attributed to a government road safety campaign
``Arrive Alive'' that began last year.
	   The casualties included 131 drivers, 132 passengers and 106
pedestrians.
	   Head-on collisions accounted for 11 percent of the accidents, 5
percent were the result of vehicles driving into the back of one
another, and 27 percent involved vehicles overturning.
	   In the same period in 1997, 468 people died, according to a
government announcement.
	   In 1996, an average of 30 people died every day of the holiday
period. The rate this year so far is 18 per day.

Netanyahu said ready to support early elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with Netanyahu to support
early-elections measure. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A storm of opposition from both foes and
friends of the new peace accord brought Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's government to the brink of collapse Monday.
	   Netanyahu, backed into a political corner, was expected later
Monday to agree to dissolve his government and call early elections
to seek a public mandate for his policies.
	   The fate of the government seemed sealed when Netanyahu's Likud
party announced it would call the early balloting, making it a
virtual certainty.
	   The move came shortly before Israel's parliament was set to take
up a welter of measures, all aimed at driving Netanyahu from power
and bringing about elections more than a year ahead of schedule.
	   The Likud move signalled an about-face by Netanyahu. Previously,
the prime minister had concentrated on trying to hold his fractious
coalition together.
	   The measures the Knesset had been poised to take up in were seen
as a broad referendum on Netanyahu's handling of the peace process
_ which has drawn fire from all sides in the two months since the
signing of the U.S.-brokered Wye River land-for-security accords.
	   The Israeli left accuses Netanyahu of bad faith and
foot-dragging, saying the prime minister never intended to live up
to promises made under the landmark Oslo accords signed by slain
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   Since Netanyahu took office in May 1996, the peace proces has
been largely stalled. The signing of the Wye accords on Oct. 23 in
Washington represented a dramatic break in what had been a 19-month
deadlock.
	   The accord's right-wing opponents, among them Jewish settlers,
have expressed fury at Netanyahu for agreeing to hand over more
West Bank land to the Palestinians in exchange for security steps.
Previously, he had promised to fight any such concessions.
	   Setting the stage for a showdown, Netanyahu's Cabinet on Sunday
approved a tough set of conditions for resuming Israel's compliance
with the Wye accords. Netanyahu said he would hold a vote to check
lawmakers' views of that move.
	   Netanyahu says the conditions _ including a demand that Arafat
renounce his intentions to declare independence by the end of May
are justified because the Palestinians have not met obligations
under the agreement.
	   The Palestinians say they have, and denounce the delays as
unfair and inflammatory.
	   ``If Wye is not carried forward, the situation in the coming few
weeks will be negative,'' said Marwan Bargouti, leader of Yasser
Arafat's Fatah faction. He said violent clashes could result.
	   The timetable on early elections will be important because of
constraints faced by a prime potential opponent, Lt. Gen. Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak.
	   Shahak, who has been on leave since stepping down as army chief
of staff in July, was to announce his retirement from the military
once elections were called.
	   Under law, Shahak would be banned from participating in politics
for 100 days after his departure from the armed forces. But with a
presidential dispensation, that could be shortened to 50 days.
	   Little is known of Shahak's policies. As a soldier, he is
prohibited from expressing an opinion, but his deep involvement in
the peace talks suggests he is a moderate who favors territorial
concessions.
	   Polls have suggested that a centrist bid by Shahak would likely
push Labor Party leader Ehud Barak out of the race in the first
round of voting and lead to a run-off between Netanyahu and Shahak.
	   Barak, whose party began the Israel-Palestinian peace process in
1993, told Israel TV a Shahak bid would be an ``unnecessary
division of strengths.''

Nicolae Ceausescu's vintage wine collection sold for dlrs 15 a
</HEADLINE>
bottle &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ More than 1,000 bottles of wine,
champagne and cognac belonging to former Communist dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu's were sold Monday for about dlrs 15 a bottle.
	   A Romanian hotel chain paid about 180 million lei (dlrs 17,000)
for 1,140 bottles of Ceausescu's wines, which he received as
presents during his 25-year-rule.
	   The vintage alcohol will go on sale at three company hotels in
Transylvania and Bucharest, ``so that anyone can drink the former
president's wine,'' Livia Sinescu, deputy director of Savion S.A.,
said by telephone.
	   The state-run company Bucur S.A., which organized the auction,
said it was ``fairly satisfied'' with the sale. The starting price
was 35 million lei (dlrs 3,334). The proceeds will go to a senior
citizens home.
	   Most of the wines come from Romanian vineyards. Others were
given to Ceausescu by other Communist leaders. The oldest bottles
come from the Tirnave vineyard in eastern Romania and date to 1918.
	   Savion outbid five other Romanian companies to buy the
collection. Each bottle is sealed with a gold ribbon, bearing an
attached card reading ``Ceausescu's family residence.''
	   Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were executed in December 1989
after a summary trial. The couple lived in the lap of luxury while
most Romanians languished in deep poverty _ both fascinating and
repelling many Romanians.
	   The government plans to include overnight stays in dozens of the
couple's marble and gold-plated villas and palaces as part of a
luxury travel package. Ceausescu's cars and boats are awaiting a
government decision to be auctioned.

Two Israelis plead innocent to spying, trial postponed

<TEXT>
	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) _ Two Israelis charged with spying in
Cyprus pleaded innocent Monday, and their trial was postponed until
next month.
	   Udi Hargov and Igal Damary, whose case has strained relations
between Israel and Cyprus, also were denied bail.
	   Israel has denied they were spying in Cyprus on behalf of Turkey
but hasn't said what their mission was.
	   But Israeli media has said it was a bungled operation by the
Mossad, possibly related to anti-aircraft missiles that Cyprus was
planning to deploy on the island in the next few weeks.
	   The botched spy mission led to the resignation of Mossad's
second-in-command, Israeli media reported.
	   Hargov, 37, and Damary, 49, were brought to court handcuffed and
guarded by armed members of the special police anti-terrorist
squad. Neither spoke during the brief proceedings, except to plead
innocent to three separate charges.
	   The trial is to open Jan. 20.
	   The two were arrested Nov. 6 at Zigi, a small fishing village on
the southern coast of Cyprus next to an army camp and a military
training area.
	   In addition to spying, they were charged with conspiring to
commit a crime while in Israel and Cyprus between Oct. 15 and Nov.
6, and with possessing scanning and recording equipment without a
government license.
	   They face a maximum sentence of 10 years.
	   Tension has risen on the island because of threats by Turkey to
prevent the planned deployment by Cyprus of Russian S-300
anti-aircraft missiles.
	   Both Israel and Turkey are known to be interested in gaining
information on the arrival of the missiles, expected in the next
few weeks.

Government admits rapes against ethnic Chinese
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Indonesian government on Monday
acknowledged that dozens of ethnic Chinese women were raped during
May riots that drove former President Suharto from power, but
denied the attacks were systematic.
	   The conclusion was based on a report issued last month by an
independent panel investigating the May 13-15 riots in which an
estimated 66 women were raped and 10 more were assaulted.
	   The unrest, sparked by economic hardship and the killings of
four student protesters by the military on May 12, left 1,200
people dead.
	   State Secretary Akbar Tanjung said Monday that the government so
far could confirm that 52 women were raped. He added that officials
had found 24 were sexually mistreated and four others were
harassed.
	   ``The government denies there was widespread and systematic rape
as had earlier been claimed by some parties,'' Tanjung said, adding
that reports of more than 100 rapes had proven unsubstantiated.
	   He also reiterated the panel's finding that not all the victims
of sexual violence were ethnic Chinese.
	   Ethnic Chinese make up just 4 percent of Indonesia's population
of 202 million. But they play a dominant role in the economy, and
this has long invited resentment that has often spilled into
violence.
	   The government will launch a rehabilitation program for the
victims of the violence and provide compensation for all material
loss incurred during the riots, Tanjung said.
	   The independent panel concluded some members of the military
urged crowds to loot and burn in an apparent attempt to destabilize
the government, while others let the angry mobs run wild.

Majer leads sensational Austrian sweep

<TEXT>
	   PATSCHERKOFEL, Austria (AP) _ Double Olympic champion Hermann
Maier led a historical Austrian sweep of the top nine places in
Monday's World Cup Super-G at the legendary Patscherkofel course.
	   Never before in World Cup history skiers from the same country
had finished 1-9 in men's or women's races.
	   Maier's victory and the team triumph at the home course which
hosted the 1976 Olympics definitely restored the prestige of
Austria's ``Power Team'' coming from three consecutive setbacks.
	   ``The Herminator'' clocked an unbeatable time of one minute,
23.52 seconds down the 1,947-meter long course, dropping 570
meters.
	   Christian Mayer and Fritz Strobl placed second and third
respectively for the all-Austrian podium in the third super giant
slalom race of the season.
	   Mayer trailed the winner by 0.76 seconds. Strobl was one
hundredth of a second back.
	   The race, started 65 minutes late because fog had initially
hampered visibility, looked like the Austrian national
championships as also late starters such Patrick Wirth and Werner
Franz beat skiers from the ``rest of the world'' for the
sensational 1-9 finish.
	   The previous best team showing dated back to 1968, when French
women finished 1-6 in a downhill race at Abetone, Italy.
	   Austrian skiers already had swept the top five places in a
Super-G at Aspen, Colo. last month.
	   Norway's Lasse Paulsen was the first of the non-Austrian
finishers in tenth place, with an impressive gap of 1.01 seconds.
	   Maier's third season victory _ the 13th of his World Cup career
- vaulted the strongly-built Austrian skier atop the overall
standings with 540 points after 12 races.
	   Norway's Lasse Kjus, who had entered Monday's race as overall
leader, slipped to second place.
	   Maier, twice fourth in the two previous races in Val Gardena and
Alta Badia, made acrobatics to avoid a spill at mid course, when he
hit the snow with a hand while clearing a gate.
	   ``It was a sensational race for me and for the team. We need
more races like this ... I skied miles away from the ideal line and
I struggled to win on this track, as Klammer did to achieve his
Olympic victory,'' Maier said.
	   Franz Klammer, who won the Olympic downhill title at this
course, was at the finish line to congratulate his
fellow-countrymen for their impressive showing.
	   The home skiers were cheered by a huge crowd, including hundreds
of children as classes in the Innsbruck area were closed for the
race.
	   ``The course was perfect, and the fans gave me a big boost,''
Maier said.
	   The men's World Cup continues at Bormio, northern Italy, with a
downhill on Dec. 29.

South Korean warship fires warning shots at Japanese fishing boat

because boat ignored orders and 10th graf with official refusing to
comment on whether Japanese boat was first believed to be a North
Korean vessel.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A South Korean warship fired several warning shots
Monday near a Japanese boat fishing for tuna in international
waters between the two countries, Japan's coast guard said.
	   Several shots landed about 10 meters (330 feet) from the 4.9-ton
vessel piloted by 41-year-old Eiji Yamamoto, but the Japanese
fisherman was unhurt, said Shinji Sezaki, a spokesman for Japan's
coast guard.
	   The incident occurred about 10 kilometers (6 miles) east of the
site where South Korean navy ships sunk a North Korean speedboat in
a gunbattle last Friday, Sezaki said.
	   The warship initially ordered Yamamoto to move away using light,
whistle and microphone signals, but the fisherman did not heed the
warning, said another coast guard spokesman, Eiji Nagano.
	   Yamamoto told Japanese authorities that he had not noticed the
preliminary warnings, Nagano said. The subsequent life fire rounds
might have been fired from a machine gun, he said.
	   A South Korean military spokesman, who identified himself only
as Lt. Col. Kim, said the warship had fired warning shots because
the boat ignored warnings to leave the area.
	   Yamamoto told Japanese officials that the shots were fired after
the South Korean boat chased him away from a point about 90
kilometers (56 miles) southwest of Izuhara, Nagasaki Prefecture
(state).
	   In Friday's incident, South Korean navy ships and aircraft sank
the North Korean vessel, described as a low-slung, speedboat used
to drop off or pick up spies, after a six-hour chase.
	   South Korean navy vessels are now searching for a suspected
mother ship, which is believed to have taken the sunken speedboat
boat toward the South Korean shore before Friday's incident.
	   Kim declined to say if the navy initially believed the Japanese
fishing boat to be the mother ship.
	   Japan's coast guard warned Japanese fishing boats to be careful
in their operations in the Korean Straight between Japan's southern
main island of Kyushu and Korea.

German warplanes join chase for railway extortionist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German air force reconnaissance jets
have joined the chase for an extortionist suspected of carrying out
three attacks on the country's railways, the government said
Monday.
	   A Defense Ministry spokesman refused to say exactly where along
the 40,000-kilometer (25,000-mile) track network the Tornado planes
were patrolling.
	   The national rail company, Deutsche Bahn, says it has received
four letters in the past week, apparently from the same person,
demanding payment of 10 million marks (dlrs 6 million).
	   Security already had been tightened on the railway following the
attacks. Some 400 border police have been assigned to guard tracks,
and helicopters also are being deployed.
	   In the most serious incident tied to the extortion attempt, a
cargo train carrying paper rolls derailed Friday near Anklam, 160
kilometers (100 miles) north of Berlin. No one was hurt.
	   Earlier last week, rail workers discovered bolts had been
loosened on the same line. Officials believe the tools to loosen
them were stolen from the railway.
	   A freight train in Berlin ran into 10 concrete flagstones on the
tracks late Saturday. The train's snow shield pushed the stones off
the tracks and it continued its journey undamaged.
	   Also Saturday, a commuter train ran into six trees that someone
had placed on the tracks. The train was damaged but continued its
journey.
	   Transport Minister Franz Muentefering said Monday he would spare
no ``personnel, energy, money and technology'' to solve the case,
which has unsettled Deutsche Bahn and travelers alike.
	   But the head of Germany's rail union, Rudi Schaefer, said rail
security was still flawed and must be improved. High-speed trains
needed permanent observation, Schaefer told the Neue Osnabruecker
Zeitung newspaper.
	   Schaefer charged the head of Deutsche Bahn, Johannes Ludewig,
had failed to properly inform railway employees and the union of
the incidents.

Tanker spills 100 tons of crude in the Gulf

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A tanker has spilled 100 tons of crude oil
in the Gulf after colliding with a jetty in Iran's southern port
city of Bandar Abbas, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported Monday.
	   Behzad Saeedpur, head of the provincial environmental protection
department, said a tanker carrying 60,000 tons of oil had collided
with the jetty while trying to berth, IRNA reported.
	   It did not say when the accident occurred or whether the tanker
was Iranian or foreign.
	   Efforts were underway to clean up the oil slick, Saeedpur said,
adding that the incident was being investigated.

French poor, jobless protest for more benefits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Thousands of jobless demonstrated across France on
Monday to press the Socialist-led government for a bigger increase
in unemployment benefits and a Christmas bonus.
	   Protests were staged in some 60 cities throughout the country
against a 3 percent rise in unemployment benefits announced by
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin last week, which jobless associations
say is too small.
	   In Paris, about 400 people occupied the headquarters of French
insurance firm AXA to protest against poverty and homelessness in
general, unfurling a banner reading ``War on Poverty''.
	   Claire Villiers, of Act Together against Unemployment (AC!),
said the protesters had singled out ``a very big financial company,
as poverty grows in our country and the government is leaning
toward measures to reduce taxes for the rich.''
	   In the southwestern city of Toulouse, jobless and homeless
groups called for ``a day of action against poverty'', staging
protests at the Matabiau rail station and the local government
representative's office to demand emergency housing and benefits
and free transport for the poor and unemployed.
	   More demonstrations were planned in Toulouse later in the day.
	   In the Mediterranean port city of Marseille, some 200 people
showed up at the doors of the regional council building demanding
that local officials hear them out.
	   Although France's unemployment rate has edged down to around
11.6 percent in recent months, jobless associations have been
seeking to rekindle a protest movement which last year led to the
occupation of dozens of unemployment offices across the country.

EU agrees cuts on gas emissions from heavy lorries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union approved a deal
Monday to cut emissions from heavy lorries by roughly 30 percent by
the year 2000 and by 50 percent by the year 2005, compared with
current levels.
	   EU environment ministers agreed on a 30 percent cut in
particulates - the invisible specks of airborne dirt from traffic
fumes that can get trapped in the lungs and cause severe damage to
people's health.
	   Ministers also agreed to curbs on hydrocarbons and carbon
monoxide by 2000. Under the new rules, heavy lorries would have to
be equipped with special exhaust filters from the year 2000.
	   Ministers also discussed how best to dispose of used cars
without polluting the environment.
	   Austria's Environment Minister Martin Bartenstein, current
chairman of the EU's environment council, said nine million
vehicles are being decommissioned each year in the Union. Of that
figure, 25 percent are considered as dangerous waste, he said.

Serb policeman reported killed in northern Kosovo town
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Albanian report from Podujevo, several hundred
Serbs attending Kosovo Polje rally &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Serb policeman was reported killed
and a woman wounded Monday in a tense northern Kosovo town,
ushering in another week of bloodshed that threatens to plunge the
Serb province back into all-out war.
	   The Serb-run Media Center reported 52-year-old Milic Jovic was
shot and wounded by unknown assailants using automatic weapons in
Podujevo early Monday. He died en route to the hospital. A woman
accompanying Jovic was wounded in the leg, the center said. The
information distributed by the Media Center cannot be independently
confirmed, but has proven reliable in the past.
	   Podujevo is overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian town some 40
kilometers (25 miles) north of Pristina, close to central Serbia.
Tensions there have grown in past weeks, as local Serbs complained
of a growing guerrilla presence and demanded a state action against
them.
	   Jovic's killing is the latest in a series of setbacks for
Kosovo's fragile truce between Serb security forces and the ethnic
Albanian separatist rebels. It is certain to enrage the Serbs,
already furious over last week's killings of six Serb youths and a
prominent Serb official.
	   The killing also came a day after the KLA buried 33 fighters who
were killed last week in a border clash with the Yugoslav army.
Some 5,000 Kosovo Albanians attended the funeral, pledging to
continue their battle against the Serb state.
	   The attack on Jovic also heightens fears that violence in Kosovo
is moving from the rugged countryside to the towns. The six youths
were killed in a bar in the western town of Pec and the official
found dead last week was deputy major Kosovo Polje, a Serb
stronghold outside Pristina.
	   The KLA has denied responsibility for the killings, but Serbian
officials and media blame the KLA.
	   The minority Serbs are to stage another rally in Kosovo Polje
Monday demanding protection against what they say is increasing
danger from the Albanians. Serbia's interior minister is expected
to address the rally.
	   Several hundred Serbs staged a rally in Kosovo Polje Monday
demanding protection against what they say is increasing danger
from the Albanians.
	   The angry crowd booed and jeered as Serbia's interior minister
Vlajko Stojiljkovic declared ``terrorism has been defeated'' and
``only gangs of criminals are left out in the field.''

Angolan rebels keep up assault on central highland city

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Angola's UNITA rebels on Monday shelled
the outskirts of a key central highland town in a bid to seize it
from government forces.
	   UNITA artillery gunners targetting Kuito opened fire at dawn,
hitting the airport and Cunji, a village that sits seven kilometers
(4 miles) away on high ground overlooking Kuito, the Roman Catholic
bishop in Kuito told Radio Eclesia.
	   The intensity of the bombing tore the roofs of some houses in
Kuito, Bishop Jose Nambi told Radio Eclesia.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties.
	   Since Angola's 1994 peace accord started unraveling earlier this
month and fighting erupted anew, battles have focused mostly on
Kuito, the capital of Bie province which lies some 500 kilometers
(300 miles) southeast of the capital Luanda.
	   Government forces attacked UNITA's central highland strongholds
Andulo and Bailundo on Dec. 4 but failed to gain control of them.
UNITA then launched an offensive to seize some central highland
towns under government control, namely Huambo and Kuito. Huambo
reportedly is calm now.
	   There are up to 60,000 displaced people in Kuito, adding to a
population of some 100,000, according to the United Nations' World
Food Program.
	   ``The thing that breaks your heart is that the city was
beginning to be rebuilt,'' WFP spokeswoman Maria Flynn said.
	   Kuito was wrecked by shelling and street fighting between
government troops and UNITA rebels in 1993, a year before the
United Nations brokered a peace agreement.
	   The pact has crumbled amid continuing hostilities between the
government and UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola.
	   Also Monday, UNITA accused Namibia and Zimbabwe of sending
troops to support President Jose Eduardo dos Santos in the renewed
fighting.
	   ``Jose Eduardo dos Santos was forced to rely on foreign military
support to try to resolve an internal conflict,'' the UNITA
leadership said in a statement faxed to The Associated Press.
	   Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia are supporting Congo's President
Laurent Kabila against insurgents who are backed by Rwanda and
Uganda, a longtime ally of UNITA.
	   Angola's civil war started in 1975, after a 14-year fight for
independence from Portuguese colonial rule.
	   The fighting was halted by a 1991 peace deal, but the agreement
collapsed a year later after UNITA refused to accept defeat in
U.N.-sponsored elections.

Deutsche Bank buys stake in Eurobank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Germany's Deutsche Bank signed an
agreement to buy a 10 percent stake in Greece's Eurobank in the
first partnership of its kind between a Greek and major foreign
bank, the two banks said Monday.
	   The price of the acquisition, which is part of a strategic
partnership between the two banks, was not announced.
	   ``The alliance with Eurobank is a further step in Deutsche
Bank's European expansion,'' said a joint statement issued by the
two sides.
	   The German bank said it took an interest in the Greek market due
to the country's anticipated participation in European economic and
monetary union and the market's growth potential.
	   ``Today Greece is in a position to become an EMU member in the
foreseeable future,'' said Brend Albrecht von Maltzan, a member of
the German bank's divisional board for retail and private clients.
	   Greece hopes to join the European Union's single currency by
2001.
	   ``The market is still underbanked. Consequently the timing is
ideal for us as it will enable us to participate in the market's
development,'' he added.
	   Two board members from Deutsche Bank will join the board of
directors of Eurobank, the second-largest private bank in Greece.
The partnership will focus on private banking activities, asset
management and selected investment banking products, the banks
said.
	   Cooperation will be extended in the future to business areas
such as insurance and transaction services.
	   ``The aim of Deutsche's European strategy is to be the leader in
the distribution of financial services and gathering assets in
Europe,'' von Maltzan said
	   Earlier this month, Deutsche Bank bought the U.S. Bankers Trust
and the Belgian unit of Credit Lyonnais. It has also made selective
acquisitions in Italy and Spain.
	   ``For Eurobank, the alliance with Deutsche Bank is an
opportunity to ... strengthen its competitive position in the
rapidly evolving Greek banking system,'' said Eurobank's Managing
Director Nicholas Nanopoulos.
	   Eurobank has been expanding within the Greek market, with
acquisitions including the Bank of Crete and an estimated 20
percent stake in Ergobank, a major Greek private bank.

Nepal's Prime Minister Koirala resigns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Nepal's Prime Minister Girija Prasad
Koirala on Monday handed his resignation to the country's king, the
royal palace said in a statement.
	   Koirala's resignation as prime minister of the minority
government is a technical requirement for Koirala's Nepali Congress
and its new partner _ the Communist Party of Nepal, United Marxist
Leninist _ to form a new coalition government.
	   Koirala will continue as the prime minister of the new coalition
government. King Birendra has also set Wednesday as the deadline
for any other parties to come forward and stake their claim for a
government as required by the constitution.
	   Nepal was an absolute monarchy until a pro-democracy movement
forced constitutional reforms in 1990 that reduced the king to a
figurehead. Nepal has been politically unstable since, with five
prime ministers in the last four years.
	   On Sunday, Koirala persuaded the communist group to back him so
the two parties could lead Nepal into general elections early next
year.
	   Koirala lost the support of a junior partner, the
Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of Nepal, on Dec. 10 when 13
government ministers from the group quit the Cabinet over several
local disputes.
	   A group of opposition parties filed a no-confidence motion
against Koirala and his nine-month-old government on Sunday.
Koirala's resignation pre-empted that move.

Netanyahu said ready to accept early elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Netanyahu to accept early elections
measure, more reaction by Palestinians on Israeli conditions. No
pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A storm of opposition from both foes and
friends of the new peace accord brought Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's government to the brink of collapse Monday.
	   Netanyahu, backed into a political corner, was expected to agree
to dissolve his government and call early elections to seek a
public mandate for his policies.
	   The fate of the government seemed sealed when Netanyahu's Likud
party announced it would call the early balloting, making it a
virtual certainty.
	   The move came shortly before Israel's parliament was set to take
up a welter of measures, all aimed at driving Netanyahu from power
and bringing about elections more than a year ahead of schedule.
	   The Likud move signaled an about-face by Netanyahu. Previously,
the prime minister had concentrated on trying to hold his fractious
coalition together.
	   The measures the Knesset had been poised to take up were seen as
a broad referendum on Netanyahu's handling of the peace process _
which has drawn fire from all sides in the two months since the
signing of the U.S.-brokered land-for-security accords.
	   The Israeli left accuses Netanyahu of bad faith and
foot-dragging, saying the prime minister never intended to live up
to promises made under the landmark Oslo accords signed by slain
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   Since Netanyahu took office in May 1996, the peace process has
been largely stalled. The signing of the land-for-security accords
on Oct. 23 in Washington represented a dramatic break in what had
been a 19-month deadlock.
	   The accord's right-wing opponents, among them Jewish settlers,
have expressed fury at Netanyahu for agreeing to hand over more
West Bank land to the Palestinians in exchange for security steps.
Previously, he had promised to fight any such concessions.
	   Setting the stage for a showdown, Netanyahu's Cabinet approved a
tough set of conditions Sunday for resuming Israel's compliance
with the accords. Netanyahu said he would hold a vote to gauge
lawmakers' views of that move.
	   Netanyahu says the conditions, including a demand that Arafat
renounce his intentions to declare independence by the end of May,
are justified because the Palestinians have not met obligations
under the agreement.
	   The Palestinians today angrily rejected the conditions in a
letter to Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh.
	   ``We consider these conditions a flagrant violation'' of the
U.S.-brokered accords, chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said.
	   Marwan Bargouti, a leader of Arafat's Fatah faction, warned
violent clashes could result if the Israelis don't implement the
accords.
	   The timetable on early elections will be important because of
constraints faced by a prime potential opponent, Lt. Gen. Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak.
	   Shahak, who has been on leave since stepping down as army chief
of staff in July, will announce his retirement from the military
once elections are called.
	   Under law, Shahak would be banned from participating in politics
for 100 days after his departure from the armed forces. But with a
presidential dispensation, that could be shortened to 50 days.
	   Little is known of Shahak's policies. As a soldier, he is
prohibited from expressing an opinion, but his deep involvement in
the peace talks suggests he is a moderate who favors territorial
concessions.
	   Polls have suggested a centrist bid by Shahak would likely push
Labor Party leader Ehud Barak out of the race in the first round of
voting and lead to a run-off between Netanyahu and Shahak.
	   Barak, whose party began the Israel-Palestinian peace process in
1993, told Israel TV a Shahak bid would be an ``unnecessary
division of strengths.''

Airstrikes left Iraqi air defense in ruins, Britain says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: TOPS with nine grafs with Blair spokesman quote, Cook says EU
to help Iraqi people; trims pvs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British-U.S. airstrikes on Iraq targeted 100 sites
and left the Iraqi air defense system ``in ruins'' and Saddam
Hussein weakened, Prime Minister Tony Blair's office said Monday.
	   The prime minister's spokesman said sites targeted during the
four-day bombardment that ended Saturday included 20 command and
control facilities and nine sites linked to the elite Republican
Guard.
	   Attacks on 35 other targets ``have left the Iraqi air defense
system in ruins,'' said the spokesman, on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   Six of the targets were related to delivery systems for Iraq's
remotely piloted weapons of mass destruction, he said.
	   ``We believe the damage that has been inflicted in the last few
days has left Saddam very weak and vulnerable,'' the spokesman
added.
	   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said earlier that Britain's next
step would be to try to isolate Iraq in the world community and
reduce any support Saddam Hussein's regime has among Arab nations.
	   Cook said there also would be new attempts to get humanitarian
aid directly to the Iraqi people.
	   ``It's not going to be easy,'' he told BBC Radio, ``because
Saddam does everything possible to obstruct and prevent it, and it
is very difficult to operate in Iraq without Saddam's agreement
given the brutality and savagery with which he represses all
opposition.''
	   After a meeting later with German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer, Cook said the European Union would participate in the
humanitarian efforts.
	   The Foreign Secretary told the BBC that Britain also wants to
ensure that United Nations monitoring of Iraq's weapons program is
maintained and that sanctions are better enforced.
	   Britain and the United States had said Iraq's refusal to
cooperate fully with the inspectors led them to attack. Iraq says
it will no longer tolerate the weapons inspections.
	   Cook said the military strikes had destroyed Saddam's ability to
jam radio programs being broadcast into Iraq from opposition groups
and news programs.
	   ``We can try now to get the truth into the Iraqi people,'' he
said.
	   The foreign secretary said he would spend Monday speaking by
telephone with European and Arab leaders to try to build support
for non-military action against Iraq.
	   ``We will be seeking to build the broadest possible consensus
against Saddam and make sure he is as isolated as possible,'' he
said.
	   Eight Arab states _ including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria _
warned Baghdad last month that it would be ``held responsible for
any consequences'' of not cooperating with U.N. officials.
	   But no Arab government expressed support for the airstrikes _
which were condemned by the world's largest Muslim group, the
52-nation Organization of the Islamic Conference based in Saudi
Arabia.
	   The United States said Sunday that the airstrikes had achieved
their specific military objectives, and that U.S. policy was
shifting toward toppling Saddam.

Serb policeman reported killed in northern Kosovo town
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Albanian government offering Kosovo Albanians
chance to meet in Tirana, reports of border incidents in final
grafs.
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Serb policeman was reported killed
and a woman wounded Monday in a tense northern Kosovo town,
ushering in another week of bloodshed that threatens to plunge the
province back into all-out war.
	   The Serb-run Media Center reported 52-year-old Milic Jovic was
shot and wounded by unknown assailants using automatic weapons in
Podujevo early Monday. He died en route to the hospital. A woman
who was accompanying Jovic was wounded in the leg, the center said.
	   The report could not be independently confirmed.
	   Podujevo is overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian town some 40
kilometers (25 miles) north of Pristina, close to central Serbia.
Tensions there have grown in past weeks, as local Serbs complained
of a growing guerrilla presence and demanded a state action against
them.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources in Podujevo Monday said a police sweep
followed the morning shooting. The Kosovo Information Center, close
to the Albanian leadership, said the town was blocked as Serb
police brought in reinforcements. Sporadic shooting could be heard
from an area northeast of the town, the center said.
	   Jovic's killing is the latest in a series of setbacks for
Kosovo's fragile truce between Serb security forces and the ethnic
Albanian separatist rebels. It is certain to enrage the Serbs,
already furious over last week's killings of six Serb youths and a
prominent Serb official.
	   The incident came a day after the KLA buried 33 fighters killed
last week in a border clash with the Yugoslav army. Some 5,000
Kosovo Albanians attended the funeral, pledging to continue their
battle against the Serb state.
	   The attack on Jovic also heightens fears that violence in Kosovo
is moving from the rugged countryside to the towns. The six youths
were killed in a bar in the western town of Pec and the official
found dead last week was deputy major Kosovo Polje, a Serb
stronghold outside Pristina.
	   The KLA has denied responsibility for the killings, but Serbian
officials and media blame the KLA.
	   Several hundred Serbs staged a rally in Kosovo Polje Monday
demanding protection against what they say is increasing danger
from the Albanians.
	   The angry crowd booed and jeered as Serbia's interior minister
Vlajko Stojiljkovic declared ``terrorism has been defeated'' and
``only gangs of criminals are left out in the field.''
	   The surge in tensions and incidents in Kosovo could disrupt a
shaky cease fire agreed to in October, and lead to resumption of
large-scale fighting. The previous Serb crackdown launched last
February claimed over 1,000 lives and forced some 300,000 people
from their homes.
	   Attempts at finding a peaceful solution for Kosovo have failed
so far with the two sides' positions still very much apart. Ethnic
Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the population, want
independence while Serbia refuses to give up control over its
southern province.
	   The KLA funeral Sunday was also aimed at presenting the rebels
as a formidable force. A special, elite KLA unit, dressed in black
uniforms, fired volleys of semi-automatic fire into the air in a
final salute as the simple wooden caskets were lowered into the
frozen ground on a ridge renamed ``Heroes' Graves'' about 30
kilometers (20 miles) west of Kosovo's capital Pristina.
	   ``We all together took the oath for the same cause,'' a KLA
commander, Saban Shala, said in a eulogy. ``And we promise you that
we will continue our fighting for freedom.''
	   In neighboring Albania Monday, the government called on the two
ethnic Albanian camps _ the KLA and loyalists of Ibrahim Rugova _
to unify their stance, offering to host talks between the two.
	   Albania's interior ministry also reported Monday an incident at
the Yugoslav-Albanian border, in which Serb border guards opened
fire early Saturday at Albanian armed units. International
observers reported similar incidents.

Russian Communists hail House impeachment vote
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ For Russian Communist Viktor Ilyukhin, the House
impeachment of U.S. President Bill Clinton is a triumph of law and
Kenneth Starr is a man to envy.
	   Ilyukhin, a former senior prosecutor turned prominent lawmaker,
has been trying for years to prosecute President Boris Yeltsin. He
finally succeeded last summer in setting up a parliamentary panel
to review charges against Yeltsin from treason to genocide against
the Russian people. The latter, he says, was masterminded by Jews _
an assertion that caused an uproar last week.
	   ``You can't trust a man who can lie, especially if he's a U.S.
president, so I welcome the (House) move'' to impeach, Ilyukhin, a
somber-looking 49-year-old, said Monday.
	   Ilyukhin had words of accolade for the U.S. legal system for
setting high standards for those in public office.
	   ``The accusations (against Clinton) of obstructing justice and
being dishonest simply wouldn't sound serious here,'' Ilyukhin told
The Associated Press. ``Our president has been lying all his life
and everyone has grown accustomed to it.''
	   Ilyukhin also openly craves the power and funds that prosecutor
Starr used to investigate Clinton's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.
	   ``Starr's material situation has been much better'' than that of
Yeltsin's foes, Ilyukhin said.
	   Vadim Filimonov, a Communist who heads the parliamentary
commission considering impeachment charges against Yeltsin, also
praised the U.S. House.
	   ``I believe that a head of state must not only observe legal
norms, but set a moral example, and I back their vote,'' Filimonov
said in an interview.
	   Unlike the Communists, the Russian media and public have mostly
supported Clinton throughout the scandal and derided his foes.
Clinton's alleged wrongdoing isn't considered serious in Russia,
where the legal system is weak and even such offenses as perjury
are rarely prosecuted.
	   ``American legislators are really strange people,'' the popular
daily Komsomolskaya Pravda scoffed Monday. ``Mrs. Clinton doesn't
mind if her handsome husband has an affair, and Bill himself hasn't
embezzled from the state, sold it to oligarchs, ruled as a dictator
and robbed his countrymen into poverty.''
	   Communists and other Yeltsin critics say he should be punished
for sending tanks against his hard-line foes in parliament in 1993,
launching the unsuccessful war in separatist Chechnya, ruining
Russia's armed forces, instigating the 1991 collapse of the Soviet
Union, and waging genocide against the Russian people.
	   The Duma's panel has already backed all the above charges except
the last, which it continued debating Monday. Once the panel
finishes its work, the full Duma will vote on whether to impeach.
	   Filimonov said Monday the vote is expected no earlier than
February.
	   Several previous attempts to impeach Yeltsin failed, and the
latest move is broadly expected to collapse, too. Even if it wins a
two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament, it would need
approval by the pro-Yeltsin Constitutional and Supreme Courts.

Havel's popularity hits all-time low
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ President Vaclav Havel's
popularity has hit an all-time low, with 55 percent of Czechs
thinking he should quit, a state-sponsored poll reported Monday.
	   The IVVM poll questioned 1,190 persons above 15 years of age in
the first week of December. The customary margin of error is 3
percent.
	   Havel's popularity peaked at 82 percent in December 1996,
shortly after he underwent cancer surgery, but has been going down
steadily since then.
	   Among those polled, 52 percent said he should quit for health
reasons, 18 percent because of unexplained loss of prestige and 12
percent because of negative influence exerted by his wife, actress
Dagmar Vesrnova.
	   ``You can be assured I am not going to stay in office against
the will of our nation,'' Havel told CTK news agency Monday in
response to the poll results, without elaboration.
	   The once-adored dissident playwright-turned president has been
in office since the overthrow of communism in 1989. He is now
serving out his last term, due to expire in 2003.
	   Havel is seen as a doing a good job representing the country
abroad by 78 percent while his activities in domestic politics only
have approval of 39 percent, according to the poll.
	   Havel made his first public appearance Monday after a week-long
break from duties caused by a minor case of flu.
	   The 62-year old president leaves for a three-week vacation on
Tuesday.

Polish premier seeks better relations with Israel

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland's Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek on
Monday called a rift with Israel over a scrapped missile deal ``a
temporary misunderstanding'' and said he wants to improve relations
between the countries.
	   Buzek's government decided Dec. 8 to halt the deal reached last
year to buy Israeli missiles for Poland's Huzar helicopters.
Israeli officials have criticized the move and threatened possible
legal action.
	   It was the latest in a series of disputes between Poland and
Israel this year, including an ongoing argument over crosses
erected on property adjoining the Auschwitz Nazi death camp, now a
museum.
	   Buzek told a news conference he regrets the tarnishing of
Poland's image in Israel and wants to improve relations between the
countries.
	   He cited his government's efforts to include Poles in the annual
March of the Living, held in April at Auschwitz to honor the
flourishing of the Jewish nation over the Nazi attempt to
annihilate it.
	   ``We want to demonstrate what links us,'' Buzek said, recalling
how he and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu walked
side-by-side in this year's march. It was the first time since the
march began in 1988 that non-Jewish Poles took part with thousands
of Jews.
	   On the scrapped missile deal, Buzek said his government waited
for eight months for Israel to field test the NTD missile in
Poland. The tests never happened.
	   ``It is the Polish side which should be disappointed,'' he said,
calling the decision to scrap the deal ``painful.''
	   Following five years of negotiating with several potential
partners, Poland's former leftist government last year awarded the
dlrs 800 million contract to Israel's Rafael and Elbit Systems Ltd.
companies to equip the Huzar helicopters in line with NATO
requirements. The deal required approval from both governments.
	   But Buzek's Solidarity-led government, which took office shortly
after the agreement was signed, criticized the handling of the
tenders by its ex-communist predecessors and demanded the missile
tests.

Iraq renews claim of victory in U.S.-British assault
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments by humanitarian programs chief; EDITS
dated material &QL;

 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Baghdad renewed its claim of victory on
Monday, and extremist Muslim groups threatened retaliation for the
four days of U.S.-British airstrikes against Iraq.
	   President Saddam Hussein met with his Revolutionary Command
Council and members of the regional command of his ruling Baath
Party, the official Iraqi News Agency said Monday.
	   It did not say when the meeting was held or what was discussed,
but the talks presumably focused on the recent assault.
	   In his first public comments since the attacks ended late
Saturday, Saddam said in a speech on Sunday that Iraq was
victorious against ``enemies of God.''
	   In the televised address, Saddam told the Iraqi people and the
army: ``God will repay well and crown your heart with clear
victory.''
	   No final casualty toll has been released, but previous reports
indicated that at least 42 Iraqis were killed and 96 wounded in the
strikes, which unleashed the most severe firepower since the 1991
Gulf War. Iraqi forces offered little resistance, other than
anti-aircraft fire.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, claimed Sunday that
thousands of people have been killed or wounded, but added that
there is no final figure. ``There has been enormous damage mainly
to the civilian infrastructure and to human lives,'' he told CNN.
	   In halting the strikes, President Bill Clinton said the 70-hour
assault severely damaged Iraq's ability to build weapons of mass
destruction.
	   A U.N. warehouse full of rice in Saddam's hometown of Tikrit was
destroyed during the strikes, Hans von Sponeck, the U.N.
humanitarian coordinator in Iraq, said Monday.
	   He said the strikes have disrupted the distribution of supplies
under the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program. ``Our program has
been severely curtailed,'' Von Sponeck told Associated Press
Television News.
	   The program allows Iraq to get around U.N. economic sanctions by
selling limited quantities of oil to buy food and other
humanitarian goods. The distribution of food is monitored by U.N.
workers, who were evacuated to Amman, Jordan during the strikes.
	   U.N. officials said the aid workers, more than 100 in all, would
leave Amman early Tuesday for Baghdad.
	   A statement issued by U.N. spokesman John Mills in New York said
oil monitors from the Dutch company Saybolt have remained on duty
and that teams from the British firm Lloyds Register had been asked
to return immediately to certify incoming food shipments.
	   The lifting of the economic sanctions is dependent on weapons
inspectors of the United Nations Special Commission, or UNSCOM,
certifying that Iraq is free of all nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons and long-range missiles.
	   But that seems a remote possibility now that Iraq has said it
will no longer allow UNSCOM to work. The sanctions were imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, and UNSCOM began work in
1991.
	   President Bill Clinton had ordered the airstrikes following a
report by UNSCOM chief Richard Butler last Tuesday that Iraq was
obstructing the inspectors' work.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Sunday the United
States might strike again if Saddam rebuilds his weapons of mass
destruction.
	   ``We reserve the right to use force again,'' Albright said on
NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
	   Iraqi officials have not allowed reporters to inspect areas
where the most extensive damage occurred, including presidential
palaces and defense installations.
	   Extremist Islamic groups, meanwhile, threatened retaliation for
the airstrikes.
	   Al-Gamaa al-Islamiya, or the Islamic Group, said in a statement
sent to the Cairo office of Al-Hayat newspaper that the attacks
were ``a disgrace to the Islamic nation,'' the paper reported
Monday.
	   The group called for a ``holy war'' against the United States
and a boycott of American and British products in the Muslim world,
the paper said. It also called trying ``those who live in the White
House as war criminals.''
	   Anonymous calls to Al-Hayat also threatened attacks on Kuwaiti
embassies and ``American interests'' in the Gulf.
	   The Pentagon says 425 Tomahawk cruise missiles were fired during
the campaign compared to 290 during the entire 1991 Gulf War to
evict Iraq from Kuwait. Iraq says its gunners shot down more than
100 Tomahawks.
	   The offensive involved 650 aircraft missions, including 32
sorties by 12 British Tornado fighter-bombers.

Serb policeman reported killed in northern Kosovo town
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with two grafs at bottom detailing Albania's call for
unity of Kosovo factions, border clash &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Serb policeman was reported killed
and a woman wounded Monday in a tense northern Kosovo town,
ushering in another week of bloodshed that threatens to plunge the
Serb province back into all-out war.
	   The Serb-run Media Center reported 52-year-old Milic Jovic was
shot and wounded by unknown assailants using automatic weapons in
Podujevo early Monday. He died en route to the hospital. A woman
accompanying Jovic was wounded in the leg, the center said. The
information distributed by the Media Center cannot be independently
confirmed, but has proven reliable in the past.
	   Podujevo is overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian town some 40
kilometers (25 miles) north of Pristina, close to central Serbia.
Tensions there have grown in past weeks, as local Serbs complained
of a growing guerrilla presence and demanded a state action against
them.
	   Jovic's killing is the latest in a series of setbacks for
Kosovo's fragile truce between Serb security forces and the ethnic
Albanian separatist rebels. It is certain to enrage the Serbs,
already furious over last week's killings of six Serb youths and a
prominent Serb official.
	   The killing also came a day after the KLA buried 33 fighters who
were killed last week in a border clash with the Yugoslav army.
Some 5,000 Kosovo Albanians attended the funeral, pledging to
continue their battle against the Serb state.
	   The attack on Jovic also heightens fears that violence in Kosovo
is moving from the rugged countryside to the towns. The six youths
were killed in a bar in the western town of Pec and the official
found dead last week was deputy major Kosovo Polje, a Serb
stronghold outside Pristina.
	   The KLA has denied responsibility for the killings, but Serbian
officials and media blame the KLA.
	   The minority Serbs are to stage another rally in Kosovo Polje
Monday demanding protection against what they say is increasing
danger from the Albanians. Serbia's interior minister is expected
to address the rally.
	   Several hundred Serbs staged a rally in Kosovo Polje Monday
demanding protection against what they say is increasing danger
from the Albanians.
	   The angry crowd booed and jeered as Serbia's interior minister
Vlajko Stojiljkovic declared ``terrorism has been defeated'' and
``only gangs of criminals are left out in the field.''
	   The surge in tensions and incidents in Kosovo could disrupt a
shaky cease fire agreed to in October, and lead to resumption of
large-scale fighting. The previous Serb crackdown launched last
February claimed more than 1,000 lives and forced some 300,000
people from their homes.
	   Attempts at finding a peaceful solution for Kosovo have failed
so far with the two sides' positions still very much apart. Ethnic
Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the population, want
independence while Serbia refuses to give up control over its
southern province.
	   The KLA funeral Sunday was also aimed at presenting the rebels
as a formidable force. A special, elite KLA unit, dressed in black
uniforms, fired volleys of semi-automatic fire into the air in a
final salute as the simple wooden caskets were lowered into the
frozen ground on a ridge renamed ``Heroes' Graves'' about 30
kilometers (20 miles) west of Kosovo's capital Pristina.
	   ``We all together took the oath for the same cause,'' a KLA
commander, Saban Shala, said in a eulogy. ``And we promise you that
we will continue our fighting for freedom.''
	   In neighboring Albania Monday, the government called on the two
ethnic Albanian camps _ the KLA and loyalists of Ibrahim Rugova _
to unify their stance, offering to host talks between the two.
	   Albania's interior ministry also reported Monday an incident at
the Yugoslav-Albanian border, in which Serb border guards opened
fire early Saturday at Albanian armed units. International
observers reported similar incidents.

Arab League considers Arab summit; anti-U.S. protests continue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TAREK EL-TABLAWY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The head of the Arab League on Monday began
consulting Arab foreign ministers on a request to convene a summit
over the U.S.-British air strikes on Iraq.
	   The Arab summit would be the first since June 1996, shortly
after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was elected to
office, sparking fears among Arabs that the peace process would be
set back.
	   At a news conference, Arab League Secretary-General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid denied speculation the summit was being used as an
excuse to mask a weak reaction by Arab governments to the military
strikes against Iraq, which sparked angry public protests
throughout the Arab world.
	   ``To stop this kind of military power is not in the hands of the
Arabs,'' he said.
	   He added that the summit's goal was to point out that military
strikes are not the means to enforce compliance with U.N. Security
Council resolutions.
	   The result of the strikes, he said, ``is that Saddam Hussein has
gained more popularity in the Arab world.''
	   Echoing a call made a day earlier by Egyptian Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa, Abdel-Meguid said that Richard Butler, chief of the
U.N. weapons inspection committee, should be replaced ``as soon as
possible'' and that the Security Council should develop a mechanism
for a ``proper UNSCOM that can result in putting an end to the
sanctions.''
	   It has been proven that Butler ``is a failure,'' Abdel-Meguid
said.
	   In another sign of renewed Arab solidarity with Iraq, the lower
house of Jordan's Parliament recommended Monday that the country
lift the economic embargo on Iraq, and called on other Arab
governments to do the same.
	   The call Monday by Jordan's 80-member lower house was largely a
gesture. It would have to be approved by the Senate, the Cabinet
and then King Hussein.
	   The Jordan Times, an English-language newspaper, wrote Monday
that calls for an individual end to sanctions were ``not a viable
option.''
	   ``Our country is neither politically nor economically strong
enough to resume open-ended economic ties with Iraq,'' it said.
	   The Jordanian government had warned citizens not to stage any
pro-Iraqi rallies _ but there were several weekend protests
nonetheless.
	   In Sudan, thousands of people including some government
officials again took to the streets Monday.
	   ``Bloody playboy, you are a liar, Mr. President'' read one
banner in English, referring to President Bill Clinton. They called
British Prime Minister Tony Blair the ``little follower of his
master.''
	   In the Syrian capital, Damascus, scores of riot police were
deployed around the American and British embassies Monday, two days
after more than 1,000 demonstrators attacked the missions to
protest the military strikes against Iraq.
	   The Syrian Foreign Ministry on Sunday expressed regret over the
attacks and pledged to upgrade security at diplomatic missions and
international organizations. (tt-jn)

Netanyahu said ready to dissolve government, go to early elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with convening of Knesset, no-confidence votes
reportedly off, minor editing &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A storm of opposition from both foes and
friends of the new peace accord brought Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's government to the brink of collapse Monday.
	   Netanyahu, backed into a political corner, was expected to agree
to dissolve his government and call early elections to seek a
public mandate for his policies.
	   Israel's divided Knesset, or parliament, convened Monday evening
for what could be a long debate on the faltering Wye River
land-for-security peace accord and prime minister's hardline stance
toward the Palestinians.
	   The fate of the government seemed sealed when Netanyahu's Likud
party announced beforehand it would call elections more than a year
ahead of schedule. The move signalled an about-face by Netanyahu,
who had previously concentrated on trying to hold his fractious
coalition together.
	   Just before lawmakers convened, Israeli media said various
political parties had agreed to scrap a planned series of
no-confidence votes in order to move more quickly to debate on the
peace process and the measure to dissolve the government.
	   Netanyahu's handling of the peace process has drawn fire from
all sides in the two months since the signing of the U.S.-brokered
accords.
	   The Israeli left accuses Netanyahu of bad faith and
foot-dragging, saying the prime minister never intended to live up
to promises made under the landmark Oslo accords signed by slain
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   Since Netanyahu took office in May 1996, the peace proces has
been largely stalled. The signing of the Wye accords on Oct. 23 in
Washington represented a dramatic break in what had been a 19-month
deadlock.
	   The accord's right-wing opponents, among them Jewish settlers,
have expressed fury at Netanyahu for agreeing to hand over more
West Bank land to the Palestinians in exchange for security steps.
Previously, he had promised to fight any such concessions.
	   Setting the stage for a showdown, Netanyahu's Cabinet on Sunday
approved a tough set of conditions for resuming Israel's compliance
with the Wye accords. Netanyahu said he would hold a vote to check
lawmakers' views of that move.
	   Netanyahu says the conditions _ including a demand that Arafat
renounce his intentions to declare independence by the end of May _
are justified because the Palestinians have not met obligations
under the agreement.
	   The Palestinians rejected that, and denounced the delays as
unfair and potentially dangerous.
	   ``If Wye is not carried forward, the situation in the coming few
weeks will be negative,'' said Marwan Bargouti, leader of Yasser
Arafat's Fatah faction. He said violent clashes could result.
	   The timetable on early elections will be important because of
constraints faced by a prime potential opponent, Lt. Gen. Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak.
	   Shahak, who has been on leave since stepping down as army chief
of staff in July, was to announce his retirement from the military
once elections were called.
	   Under law, Shahak would be banned from participating in politics
for 100 days after his departure from the armed forces. But with a
presidential dispensation, that could be shortened to 50 days.
	   Little is known of Shahak's policies. As a soldier, he is
prohibited from expressing an opinion, but his deep involvement in
the peace talks suggests he is a moderate who favors territorial
concessions.
	   Polls have suggested that a centrist bid by Shahak would likely
push Labor Party leader Ehud Barak out of the race in the first
round of voting and lead to a run-off between Netanyahu and Shahak.
	   Barak, whose party began the Israel-Palestinian peace process in
1993, told Israel TV a Shahak bid would be an ``unnecessary
division of strengths.''

Nuremberg appoint Rausch as coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NUREMBERG, Germany (AP) _ FC Nuremberg on Monday appointed
Friedel Rausch its new coach and gave him the job of trying to save
the struggling Bundesliga club from relegation.
	   Rausch, who was fired from bottom-placed Borussia
Moenchengladbach in November, takes over from Willi Reimann.
	   Reimann resigned Dec. 2 to spend more time with his ill wife.
	   Rausch, 58, was given a contract until the end of the season.
	   ``I am going to Nuremberg with great optimism,'' Rausch said.
``I believe I can save the club from relegation. The club has
future and substance.''
	   Nuremberg is second-to-last in the 18-team Bundesliga, which
began its two-month winter break Monday.

Angolan rebels keep up assault on central highland city
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Angola's UNITA rebels on Monday shelled
the outskirts of a key central highland town in a bid to seize it
from government forces.
	   UNITA artillery gunners targeting Kuito opened fire at dawn,
hitting the airport and Cunji, a village that sits seven kilometers
(4 miles) away on high ground overlooking Kuito, the Roman Catholic
bishop in Kuito told Radio Eclesia.
	   The intensity of the bombing tore off the roofs of some houses
in Kuito, Bishop Jose Nambi told Radio Eclesia.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties.
	   Since Angola's 1994 peace accord started unraveling earlier this
month and fighting erupted anew, battles have focused mostly on
Kuito, the capital of Bie province which lies some 500 kilometers
(300 miles) southeast of the capital Luanda.
	   Government forces attacked UNITA's central highland strongholds
Andulo and Bailundo on Dec. 4 but failed to gain control of them.
UNITA then launched an offensive to seize some central highland
towns under government control, namely Huambo and Kuito. Huambo
reportedly is calm now.
	   There are up to 60,000 displaced people in Kuito, adding to a
population of some 100,000, according to the United Nations' World
Food Program.
	   ``The thing that breaks your heart is that the city was
beginning to be rebuilt,'' WFP spokeswoman Maria Flynn said.
	   Kuito was wrecked by shelling and street fighting between
government troops and UNITA rebels in 1993, a year before the
United Nations brokered a peace agreement.
	   The pact has crumbled amid continuing hostilities between the
government and UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola.
	   Also Monday, UNITA accused Namibia and Zimbabwe of sending
troops to support President Jose Eduardo dos Santos in the renewed
fighting.
	   ``Jose Eduardo dos Santos was forced to rely on foreign military
support to try to resolve an internal conflict,'' the UNITA
leadership said in a statement faxed to The Associated Press.
	   Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia are supporting Congo's President
Laurent Kabila against insurgents who are backed by Rwanda and
Uganda, a longtime ally of UNITA.
	   Angola's civil war started in 1975, after a 14-year fight for
independence from Portuguese colonial rule.
	   The fighting was halted by a 1991 peace deal, but the agreement
collapsed a year later after UNITA refused to accept defeat in
U.N.-sponsored elections.

Top French general visits Macedonia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ France's top general said Monday that
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic would be informed beforehand
in the event that French-led NATO troops in Macedonia are sent to
Kosovo.
	   ``These are not intervention forces which will be used to
jeopardize Yugoslavia's sovereignty, their deployment was decided
in a United Nations resolution,'' said Gen. Jean Pierre Kelche
adding ``Mr. Milosevic's vision should develop in that direction.''
	   The troops are stationed in Macedonia to provide protection for
some 2,000 international verifiers stationed in Yugoslavia's
neighboring Kosovo province, should they run into trouble.
	   Milosevic, who last October signed a deal for Kosovo envisaging
deployment of international monitors in the province, said in a
recent interview that attempts by NATO troops in Macedonia to cross
into Kosovo were not part of the agreement and would be prevented
by Yugoslav troops.
	   Some 1,800 NATO soldiers are still arriving in Macedonia to form
a backup force for the verifiers. Most of the NATO soldiers in the
mission will be French.
	   ``In case the Alliance's extraction force is asked to intervene
in Kosovo, NATO will be obliged to inform Slobodan Milosevic of
that,'' said Kelche.
	   Kelche also met top Macedonian officials.
	   Gen. Trajce Krstevski, Macedonian army commander, said Macedonia
would not get involved in possible problems between Yugoslavia and
NATO.
	   Macedonia is the only former Yugoslav republic which seceded
without bloodshed. Yugoslavia now consists only of Serbia and
Montenegro, while Kosovo is a province in Serbia.

Famed monk ready for beatification
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with beatification date, celebrations

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Padre Pio, an Italian Capuchin monk credited
with supernatural powers by followers around the world, will be
beatified in May, the Vatican announced Monday.
	   The way was cleared with certification by the Vatican of a
miracle attributed to his intercession.
	   The beatification ceremony -- the last step before possible
sainthood -- will take place May 2, Vatican spokesman Joaquin
Navarro-Valls said.
	   The announcement set off celebrations at the sanctuary in San
Giovanni Rotondo in southern Italy, where Padre Pio died in 1968.
His tomb in southern Italy attracts millions of visitors a year.
	   Church bells pealed, fireworks were set off and sirens sounded
to greet the news.
	   In a ceremony Monday attended by Pope John Paul II, the Vatican
said the recovery of a Salerno woman who prayed to Padre Pio was
``extraordinary.'' She was hospitalized after a lymph vessel burst
but recovered in a few days, according to the Vatican
documentation.
	   In 1997, the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints
officially recognized the virtuous qualities of Padre Pio, making
the monk ``venerable'' in the eyes of the Roman Catholic church.
	   Born Francesco Forgione in 1887, he was a military chaplain
during World War I. After the war, he returned to his monastery in
Puglia, and quickly developed a reputation for exceptional
holiness.
	   He gained fame in 1918 when he began to bleed from his hands,
feet and side -- the first priest in centuries to show signs of the
stigmata.
	   His beatification will be one of the fastest in modern times.

Anti-American sentiment in Russia could delay arms control treaty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with speculation that START II treaty, loans to Russia
could be delayed, ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Iraq &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With anti-American sentiment running high in
Russia, the ratification of the START II arms control treaty could
again be delayed, a prominent politician said Monday.
	   Alexander Shokhin, a moderate who leads the second largest
faction in parliament, said many Russian politicians were still
upset by the American airstrikes on Iraq, and were unlikely to
approve the arms treaty in the current atmosphere, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   Russia's parliament has been delaying action on the treaty for
years, though there were recent signs that it might be moving
toward ratification _ until last week's strikes on Iraq.
	   Russia has long opposed the use of force against Iraq, and said
the airstrikes only complicated any settlement in the long-running
confrontation between the Arab nation and United Nations over
weapons inspectors.
	   Shokhin's faction, Our Home is Russia, supports the START II
treaty, and Shokhin expressed regret that approval could again be
put off. The United States ratified the treaty in 1996.
	   Shokhin also warned that Russia's opposition to the bombings in
Iraq might lead the United States to oppose international loans for
Russia.
	   But another senior politician said Russia's stance would not
affect decisions on foreign aid.
	   ``Russia's tough stance is justified,'' First Deputy Premier
Yuri Maslyukov was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies. ``It
emphasizes the significance of the country, and this toughness will
serve as yet another positive reason for offering us a loan.''
	   With Russia in the throes of an economic crisis, it badly needs
international loans. But the IMF and others have frozen
disbursements since the country's economic crisis hit in August.
	   The United States has the power to block IMF loans, but has
given no indication that it would object to giving money to Russia
because of its position on Iraq.
	   Russia recalled its ambassadors from the United States and
Britain to protest the bombings, which ended over the weekend after
four days.
	   Citing Foreign Ministry sources, the ITAR-Tass and Interfax news
agencies reported that Russia would send Ambassador Yuli Vorontsov
back to Washington within days. The reports gave no additional
details.
	   The Russians have long-standing relations with Iraq and want to
help rebuild the country's oil industry when U.N. sanctions are
lifted. The sanctions were imposed following Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.

Netanyahu said ready to dissolve government, go to early elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with convening of Knesset, no-confidence votes
reportedly off, minor editing &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A storm of opposition from both foes and
friends of the new peace accord brought Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's government to the brink of collapse Monday.
	   Netanyahu, backed into a political corner, was expected to agree
to dissolve his government and call early elections to seek a
public mandate for his policies.
	   Israel's divided Knesset, or parliament, convened Monday evening
for what could be a long debate on the faltering Wye River
land-for-security peace accord and prime minister's hard-line
stance toward the Palestinians.
	   The fate of the government seemed sealed when Netanyahu's Likud
party announced beforehand it would call elections more than a year
ahead of schedule. The move signaled an about-face by Netanyahu,
who had previously concentrated on trying to hold his fractious
coalition together.
	   Just before lawmakers convened, Israeli media said various
political parties had agreed to scrap a planned series of
no-confidence votes in order to move more quickly to debate on the
peace process and the measure to dissolve the government.
	   Netanyahu's handling of the peace process has drawn fire from
all sides in the two months since the signing of the U.S.-brokered
accords.
	   The Israeli left accuses Netanyahu of bad faith and
foot-dragging, saying the prime minister never intended to live up
to promises made under the landmark Oslo accords signed by slain
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   Since Netanyahu took office in May 1996, the peace process has
been largely stalled. The signing of the Wye accords on Oct. 23 in
Washington represented a dramatic break in what had been a 19-month
deadlock.
	   The accord's right-wing opponents, among them Jewish settlers,
have expressed fury at Netanyahu for agreeing to hand over more
West Bank land to the Palestinians in exchange for security steps.
Previously, he had promised to fight any such concessions.
	   Setting the stage for a showdown, Netanyahu's Cabinet on Sunday
approved a tough set of conditions for resuming Israel's compliance
with the Wye accords. Netanyahu said he would hold a vote to check
lawmakers' views of that move.
	   Netanyahu says the conditions _ including a demand that Arafat
renounce his intentions to declare independence by the end of May _
are justified because the Palestinians have not met obligations
under the agreement.
	   The Palestinians rejected that, and denounced the delays as
unfair and potentially dangerous.
	   ``If Wye is not carried forward, the situation in the coming few
weeks will be negative,'' said Marwan Bargouti, leader of Yasser
Arafat's Fatah faction. He said violent clashes could result.
	   The timetable on early elections will be important because of
constraints faced by a prime potential opponent, Lt. Gen. Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak.
	   Shahak, who has been on leave since stepping down as army chief
of staff in July, was to announce his retirement from the military
once elections were called.
	   Under law, Shahak would be banned from participating in politics
for 100 days after his departure from the armed forces. But with a
presidential dispensation, that could be shortened to 50 days.
	   Little is known of Shahak's policies. As a soldier, he is
prohibited from expressing an opinion, but his deep involvement in
the peace talks suggests he is a moderate who favors territorial
concessions.
	   Polls have suggested that a centrist bid by Shahak would likely
push Labor Party leader Ehud Barak out of the race in the first
round of voting and lead to a run-off between Netanyahu and Shahak.
	   Barak, whose party began the Israel-Palestinian peace process in
1993, told Israel TV a Shahak bid would be an ``unnecessary
division of strengths.''

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ About 100 people from Poland's Arab
community, many carrying Iraqi flags and photos of Saddam Hussein,
demonstrated Monday outside the U.S. and British embassies to
protest air strikes on Iraq.
	   The group, mostly comprising students of Warsaw's Arab school
and children of diplomats from Arab countries, chanted ``America
kills children'' and ``People of Iraq, we are with you.''
	   Adam Abdelkadir, head of the Arab school, said U.S.-British air
strikes supposedly targeting military installations instead were
meant for ``murdering women and children.''
	   The protesters burned a small U.S. flag and handed over letters
to British Prime Minister Tony Blair and U.S. President Bill
Clinton condemning the military attacks.
	   No final casualty toll has been released, but previous reports
indicated at least 42 Iraqis were killed and 96 wounded in the
strikes, the most intensive military operation in the region since
the 1991 Gulf War. Iraqi forces offered little resistance other
than anti-aircraft fire.
	   U.S. and British officials say the attacks were intended to
heavily damage Iraq's ability to manufacture chemical or biological
weapons.

Exiled Iranian authors appeal to U.N. to intervene for dead

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Iranian authors who said they escaped into exile
after being imprisoned and tortured appealed Monday to the United
Nations to intervene with Iran on behalf of writers killed there.
	   As part of a series of protests around Europe, a delegation of
the Association of Iranian Writers in Exile came to the U.N.
European headquarters to report on a string of slayings in Iran for
which they hold the government responsible.
	   Starting a year after the 1979 Iranian revolution, poets and
other writers have been executed in Iran, said Reza Allamehzadeh, a
writer and filmmaker based in the Netherlands.
	   He and other writers who live outside Iran for their own safety
said they had the latest killings have gone beyond the pattern of
``writers under the pressure of arrest and execution.''
	   ``What is different this time is that it's a string of killings
in a very cruel way,'' said Allamehzadeh, who led the delegation to
meet with U.N. human rights officials.
	   Fereidoun Gilani, a poet and former newspaper editor, said the
victims had been among six writers who were trying to reestablish
the writers group in Iran. All six were arrested and tortured, said
Gilani.
	   ``They let them go and they killed them from behind,'' he said.
	   Two of those slain, Mohammad Jafar Pouyandeh and Mohammad
Mokhtari, were summoned by a court two months ago for questioning
about their activities. Their bodies later were found dumped on the
outskirts of Tehran. They were apparently strangled.
	   The writers group has been demonstrating in memory of Pouyandeh
and Mokhtari, and another writer, Majid Sharif, who also was found
dead after disappearing from his home.
	   They also noted that the head of an Iranian opposition group,
Dariush Foruhar, and his wife, Parvaneh, were found stabbed to
death in their home last month.
	   The five slain people had criticized hard-line clergymen who
support Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and oppose
moderate President Mohammad Khatami's attempts at social and
political reforms.
	   But the writers delegation said they hold the entire government,
including Khatami, responsible.
	   ``This does not mean that we think Khatami is organizing
terrorists to kill, but it does mean he is in a position of
responsibility,'' said Allamehzadeh.

Berlin tightens security after Jewish cemetery blast
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with security tightened, rightist radicals
blamed. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Berlin authorities ordered tighter security at the
city's Jewish sites Monday after a bomb blast destroyed the grave
of a former German Jewish leader.
	   The city interior ministry said there were no immediate suspects
in the Saturday night attack, which blew up Heinz Galinski's marble
tombstone in a Jewish cemetery in western Berlin.
	   Interior minister Eckart Werthebach said the home-made bomb was
packed into the steel cap of a gas canister for maximum explosive
impact.
	   Galinski headed Germany's Central Council of Jews from 1988
until his death in 1992. He had headed Berlin's Jewish community
since 1949.
	   Ignatz Bubis, who succeeded Galinski as head of the central
council, visited the gravesite Monday and blamed the attack on
rightist extremists. Federal agents were helping investigate the
bombing as a potential political crime.
	   A similar attack on Galinski's grave three months ago caused
minor damage. Police have no suspects in that explosion.
	   Police patrols at the cemetery in Charlottenburg district and
other Jewish sites in Berlin now are being stepped up, said
interior spokesman Martin Strunden.
	   Many Germans reacted with horror to the attack.
	   Volker Beck, a lawmaker for the Greens party, said it showed
anti-Semitism continued to fester in the country.
	   In a telegram earlier to Galinski's wife Ruth, President Roman
Herzog called the attack ``the result of crazy minds and the work
of confused loners,'' and said he wanted to express his sadness and
pain for himself and the Germans.

Congolese rebel leader in talks with Gadhafi

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ The leader of Congolese rebels fighting to
oust President Laurent Kabila held talks Monday with Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi, the rebels' first such meeting with Kabila's major
ally.
	   A Congolese rebel representative traveling with Ernest Wamba dia
Wamba, leader of the Congolese Democratic Coalition, said the
two-hour meeting took place Monday in the Libyan capital, Tripoli,
but he had no other details.
	   Gadhafi has been backing Kabila in a civil war that has drawn in
Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad on the government side and
Rwanda and Uganda on the rebel side.
	   Reports in the independent press in Chad say that Gadhafi is
underwriting the cost of sending Chadian troops to northern Congo.
At least 100 have been reported killed and an undetermined number
taken prisoner by Ugandan troops.
	   Kabila's refusal to accept a cease-fire and enter into
negotiations with the rebel coalition of ethnic Congolese Tutsis,
disaffected Conglese soldiers and opposition politicians has made
any peace agreement impossible.
	   Kabila insists on the withdrawal of troops sent by Rwanda and
Uganda, which say they will remain in Congo in the absence of
security guarantees from Kabila for their eastern borders.
	   Both countries accuse their former protege of enlisting Rwandan
and Ugandan rebels bent on destabilizing their governments.
	   Wamba traveled to Libya from Burkina Faso where he attended a
summit of the conflict resolution body of the Organization of
African Unity that called last week for a cease-fire to be signed
in Lusaka, Zambia, on Dec. 28.
	   But doubts remained whether Kabila will agree to meet the
rebels, who repeated their call in the Burkinabe capital,
Ouagadougou, for his removal from power.
	   It wasn't clear how much Gadhafi could contribute to the fragile
Congolese peace process, but the rebels were apparently hoping he
could withdraw his financial support for the Chadian troops and put
pressure on Kabila to negotiate.
	   Since the beginning of the year, Gadhafi has stepped up efforts
to become a major player in African affairs and succeeded in
convincing OAU member states to denounce the U.N. ban on air travel
to Libya because of his refusal to hand over two suspects in the
bombing of a Pan Am airliner a decade ago over Lockerbie, Scotland.

French Foreign Minister calls for changes in UNSCOM
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with comment by German Defense Minister in new grafs
8-10 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said on
Monday that the international community needed to put in place a
system of continuous control over Iraqi weapons.
	   Vedrine also said in an interview with RTL radio that a weapons
control program should be carried out by a modified version of
UNSCOM, the U.N. weapons inspection commission.
	   The French Foreign Minister repeated his country's long-standing
call for a lifting of sanctions imposed against Iraq as a result of
the Gulf War.
	   ``We believe we should go toward a lifting of the embargo,''
Vedrine said. He added that sanctions should be lifted only once a
system to inspect Iraq's weapons was in place.
	   The embargo only hurts the civilian population, Vedrine said.
	   France has been critical of the airstrikes, arguing they won't
resolve the crisis with Iraq.
	   German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping said after meeting his
French counterpart that his government regretted that Britain and
the United States had resorted to airstrikes but that they had been
necessary.
	   ``We regret that these airstrikes were neceesary, but they
became necessary when Iraq, for the fourth time in recent months,
broke its promises to the United Nations,'' Scharping said.
	   Echoing Vedrine, both Defense Ministers said a new method of
monitoring Iraq's weapons systems had to be worked out.

Lebanese Cabinet reverses ban on demonstrations, names commander
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon's new government on Monday lifted
a five-year ban on public demonstrations.
	   The Cabinet _ in its first meeting since Prime Minister Salim
Hoss' government won a vote of confidence last week _ also named a
new commander for the country's 65,000-strong army, according to
Information Minister Anwar Khalil.
	   He is Brig. Gen. Michel Suleiman, a Maronite Catholic, who most
recently commanded forces in southern Lebanon.
	   Suleiman, 50, replaces Gen. Emile Lahoud, who was elected by
Parliament as Lebanon's president on Oct. 15.
	   The ban on street protests _ which had often turned violent _
had been in place since September 1993. It was imposed after nine
people were killed in clashes between troops and militant Muslims
protesting the first Palestinian-Israeli peace accord.
	   In 1992, street riots amid an economic crisis forced the
resignation of then-Prime Minister Omar Karami.
	   Khalil said demonstrations would be allowed, but only with
Interior Ministry approval.
	   The Cabinet's decision was ``in line with the government's
policy of protecting freedoms, particularly the freedom of
expression,'' Khalil said.
	   The previous government of Prime Minister Rafik Hariri
repeatedly banned protests and, on occasion, sent the army into the
streets to prevent labor unions from staging protests against
Hariri's economic policies.
	   Suleiman, the new commander, joined the army in 1967. In recent
years, he commanded the estimated 12,000 troops stationed along
Israel's self-styled ``security zone'' in southern Lebanon.
	   The choice respected a tradition that the army commander be a
Maronite under Lebanon's power-sharing formula among its 18
religious sects.

Little girl stabbed with drug needle in unprovoked attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A 10-year-old girl was stabbed by a drug
addict with a hypodermic needle this weekend in an unprovoked
attack that has sent chills and fury through the country.
	   The attack, which was the top story in many Norwegian newspapers
Monday, underlines concerns that crime is spiraling in Oslo, long
noted as one of the world's safest major cities.
	   The attack took place Sunday in a downtown Oslo shopping mall,
where the girl and her mother were buying Christmas presents.
According to reports, a man known to be a drug addict approached
without warning and stabbed the girl with a used needle.
	   It will take at least for tests to determine if the girl has
been infected with the HIV virus. The virus, which causes AIDS, is
often linked to intravenous drug use.
	   Norway's largest newspaper, Verdens Gang, expressed the anger of
many in an editorial noting that the alleged attacker had been
arrested a few hours earlier at the same mall.
	   ``The scum who used his needle against a little girl was caught
by police a few hours earlier for shoplifting. After giving his
personal details, he was released,'' the editorial said.
	   An apparent increase in unprovoked violence in the traditionally
peaceful Norwegian capital of 500,000 people has brought a recent
public outcry for stricter law enforcement.
	   In other incidents Sunday, a security van was robbed at gunpoint
while emptying a bank's night safe and churchgoers overpowered a
man who tried to steal their collection plate during a service.
	   ``If this continues, the Church may have to ask police for help
so that people can safely got a church service on Sunday morning to
hear a message of peace,'' the Verdens Gang editorial said.

International observers report border violations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Several Serb soldiers have repeatedly
crossed into Albania territory from neighboring Yugoslavia,
shooting just once before returning, international officials
reported Monday.
	   According to observers from the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe who were traveling with an Albanian police
unit near the border region of Tropoja, the most recent incident
occurred early Saturday.
	   ``They (Serbs) entered 50 meters inside of Albanian territory
and one of them shot just once'' said Andrea Angeli, a spokesman
for the OSCE told the Associated Press.
	   Angeli also said that such incursions have been reported
frequently in the past few weeks.

Netanyahu said ready to dissolve government, go to early elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 5-7 with Mordechai quote, color &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A storm of opposition from both foes and
friends of the new peace accord brought Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's government to the brink of collapse Monday.
	   Netanyahu, backed into a political corner, was expected to agree
to dissolve his government and call early elections to seek a
public mandate for his policies.
	   Israel's divided Knesset, or parliament, convened Monday evening
for what was expected to be lengthy debate on the faltering Wye
River land-for-security peace accord and prime minister's hardline
stance toward the Palestinians.
	   The fate of the government seemed sealed when Netanyahu's Likud
party announced beforehand it would back calling elections more
than a year ahead of schedule. The move signalled an about-face by
Netanyahu, who had previously concentrated on trying to hold his
fractious coalition together.
	   ``It's a sad day,'' declared Netanyahu's defense minister,
Yitzhak Mordechai. ``It's a day when the government decides on its
end, and the Knesset decides to dissolve itself _ it's of course a
very sad day.''
	   The Knesset's spectators' gallery was packed with dignitaries as
the session got under way. A sticker posted in the parliament's
halls read, ``Come on, Sara, let's go home'' _ referring to
Netanyahu's wife.
	   The hours beforehand were filled with with last-minute political
dealmaking. Confused Knesset members wandered in an out of the
wood-and-stone plenum chamber, asking journalists if they knew what
agenda had been settled on.
	   Just before lawmakers convened, Israeli media said various
political parties had agreed to scrap a planned series of
no-confidence votes in order to move more quickly to debate on the
peace process and the measure to dissolve the government.
	   Netanyahu's handling of the peace process has drawn fire from
all sides in the two months since the signing of the U.S.-brokered
accords.
	   The Israeli left accuses Netanyahu of bad faith and
foot-dragging, saying the prime minister never intended to live up
to promises made under the landmark Oslo accords signed by slain
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   Since Netanyahu took office in May 1996, the peace process has
been largely stalled. The signing of the Wye accords on Oct. 23 in
Washington represented a dramatic break in what had been a 19-month
deadlock.
	   The accord's right-wing opponents, among them Jewish settlers,
have expressed fury at Netanyahu for agreeing to hand over more
West Bank land to the Palestinians in exchange for security steps.
Previously, he had promised to fight any such concessions.
	   Setting the stage for a showdown, Netanyahu's Cabinet on Sunday
approved a tough set of conditions for resuming Israel's compliance
with the Wye accords. Netanyahu said he would hold a vote to check
lawmakers' views of that move.
	   Netanyahu says the conditions _ including a demand that Arafat
renounce his intentions to declare independence by the end of May _
are justified because the Palestinians have not met obligations
under the agreement.
	   The Palestinians rejected that and denounced the delays as
unfair and potentially dangerous.
	   ``If Wye is not carried forward, the situation in the coming few
weeks will be negative,'' said Marwan Bargouti, leader of Yasser
Arafat's Fatah faction. He said violent clashes could result.
	   The timetable on early elections will be important because of
constraints faced by a prime potential opponent, Lt. Gen. Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak.
	   Shahak, who has been on leave since stepping down as army chief
of staff in July, was to announce his retirement from the military
once elections were called.
	   Under law, Shahak would be banned from participating in politics
for 100 days after his departure from the armed forces. But with a
presidential dispensation, that could be shortened to 50 days.
	   Little is known of Shahak's policies. As a soldier, he is
prohibited from expressing an opinion, but his deep involvement in
the peace talks suggests he is a moderate who favors territorial
concessions.
	   Polls have suggested that a centrist bid by Shahak would likely
push Labor Party leader Ehud Barak out of the race in the first
round of voting and lead to a run-off between Netanyahu and Shahak.
	   Barak, whose party began the Israel-Palestinian peace process in
1993, told Israel TV a Shahak bid would be an ``unnecessary
division of strengths.''

One year after massacre, war simmers on and villagers still afraid

	   ACTEAL, Mexico (AP) _ Little has changed in Chiapas' sluggish
war in the year since peasants aided by police marched into this
muddy little village and gunned down 45 men, women and children for
not supporting Mexico's ruling party.
	   Everything has changed for Acteal.
	   A 5-year-old boy pushes a toy truck though the mud, using his
left hand because the fingers of his right one were hacked off. An
uncle leads a 4-year-old girl along a path; her parents are both
dead and the bullet that passed through her brain left her blind.
	   Almost everyone here is still mourning _ a quarter of the
village's population is buried beneath a brick chapel in the center
of town, empty but for the names and framed photographs of the
dead.
	   ``I have so much pain,'' lamented Mariano Vazquez Ruiz, a
34-year-old farmer who survived only by playing dead under a pile
of bodies for an entire day while blood oozed from a bullet wound
in his chest.
	   He lost his wife and two daughters; he lives now with his mother
and three sons, one of whom is the maimed 5-year-old.
	   For Vazquez, the nightmare continues. The only work he knows is
coffee farming, and he is too scared to harvest his fields.
	   ``I'm afraid because the paramilitaries are still on the
loose,'' he said.
	   He said government supporters from surrounding villages
harvested his fields last year and that they would run him off, or
worse, if he tried to reclaim them.
	   Twice this month, soldiers aligned with anti-rebel villagers
have driven Acteal residents from their coffee fields in the nearby
village of Majomut, shooting in the air and in one case stabbing
two women and a man with bayonets.
	   Soldiers at two roadblocks note down the name and purpose of
anyone headed toward Acteal. First Officer Luis Plascencia said he
was searching for weapons, and couldn't explain why that required
seeing ID of people who didn't have any.
	   The village of mostly illiterate Indians has quickly become a
player in the international human rights circuit. Journalists,
social workers and leftists from around the world are a constant
presence there, and villagers have traveled throughout Mexico to
address human rights conferences about the slaughter.
	   Acteal residents and human rights groups say members of the
vigilante squad that carried out the massacre are still free.
	   The attorney general's office on Sunday issued a 153-page report
saying 135 people had been arrested in the case. But only one has
been convicted and no high-ranking officials have been arrested.
Eighteen, including former Gov. Julio Cesar Ruiz Ferro, have
resigned over the scandal.
	   The report concluded that old conflicts _ not politics _ and
local lawlessness were primary causes of the massacre. Marina
Jimenez, head of the Fray Bartolome de las Casas Human Rights
Center, called that cynical.
	   ``The investigation is trying to cover up the existence of
paramilitary groups and the role of the state and federal
governments in the massacre,'' she said.
	   ``Local government leaders continue to meet with the
paramilitary groups, and the army is playing a determining role in
the arming and training of the civilian population.''
	   She also accused Gov. Roberto Albores Guillen of bad faith in
his recent proposal of an amnesty for weapons possession _ which he
calls an attempt to abolish paramilitary groups.
	   The proposal apparently would free anyone arrested on weapons
charges, retroactively _ including some of those arrested in the
Acteal massacre.
	   The governor canceled an interview scheduled with The Associated
Press, then said he was too busy to set another time.
	   In the Cerro Hueco prison in the state capital, Tuxtla
Gutierrez, three of those arrested in the massacre denied having
been anywhere near the village when the shooting started.
	   ``Here we are, paying for the sins of others,'' said Felipe
Vazquez, a local police commander accused of telling state
authorities that rumors of an attack were false even as the gunfire
continued.
	   ``Our conscience is clean,'' added Jacinto Arias, who was mayor
of the municipality that includes Acteal.
	   Meanwhile, the low-level war between the government and leftist
Indians continues to simmer.
	   The Zapatista National Liberation Army rose up in a 12-day war
in January 1994, then retreated into the remote mountains of
Chiapas, demanding negotiations with the government.
	   Occasional skirmishes continue to kill supporters of both sides,
but there have been few direct clashes between troops and rebels.
There may be only a few hundred of the latter left.
	   Sporadic attempts at peace talks continue to collapse with each
side accusing the other of bad faith.
	   Rebels claim the government has failed to implement Indian
autonomy measures in a partial accord signed two years ago, and
refuse to negotiate further until it does.
	   Almost nobody is optimistic that the conflict can be resolved
any time soon.
	   Rodolfo Stavenhagen, a sociologist who heads a commission
monitoring the peace talks, said neither side has much to gain by
restarting the peace talks. And that, he said, is dangerous.
	   ``I'm not optimistic that we can have a solution in the short
term,'' he said. ``At any moment we could see violence again.''

U.S. officers: 72 percent bombs on target in `impressive' display
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRIAN MURPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABOARD THE USS ENTERPRISE (AP) _ Even using highly touted
laser-guided bombs, more than a quarter of the airstrikes launched
from the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise missed their main targets,
naval commanders said Monday.
	   But American officials praised the percentage as exceptionally
good and denied claims by Iraq that hospitals or other civilian
sites could have been hit by misdirected U.S. airstrikes.
	   ``I can say that everyone is very pleased with the success of
the airstrikes,'' said Rear Adm. J. Cutler Dawson Jr., commander of
the eight-vessel Enterprise battle group in the Gulf. ``This is an
impressive figure.''
	   The ship's air wing commander, Capt. Tom Hagen, told the
Enterprise crew that preliminary analyses showed 72 percent of the
airstrikes were on target. Digital video images of all the
airstrikes are getting a more detailed review at Central Command in
Tampa, Florida.
	   The success rate estimate did not take into account Tomahawk
cruise missile strikes and only included the more than 300 missions
flown off the Enterprise during the four nights of attacks. Another
350 sorties were flown off the ground, including B-2 and B-1
bombers and Britain's Tornado fighter-bombers.
	   ``This is excellent,'' said Hagen, who noted that a 50 percent
on-target rate is typical for fighter-bombers in a combat
situation.
	   The majority of the bombs fired by the F/A-18 and F-14 warplanes
were the so-called ``smart bombs'' fitted with laser-guided
navigation systems, weapons system chiefs said. The rest were
conventional bombs _ ranging from 500 pounds to 2,000 pounds (227
kilograms to 910 kilograms) _ that free fall from the planes.
Officers on the ship refused to give a precise breakdown of the
types used in the raids.
	   American officials have acknowledged that Iraq retains some of
its capability to produce weapons. And they have left open the
possibility that attacks could resume.
	   During the assault, 425 Tomahawk missiles were fired and Iraq
says it shot down more than 100 of them. Dawson said 325 Tomahawks
were fired from the ships in the Enterprise battle group. The
others were launched from B-2 bombers.
	   Officers and pilots on the Enterprise refused to speculate on
what could have been hit by bombs that missing the central targets.
	   Dawson insisted that no medical facilities or major civilian
areas were near the target sites, as claimed by President Saddam
Hussein's government.
	   ``This could have been done by Saddam's own anti-aircraft
fire,'' said Dawson. ``What goes up must come down.'' He also noted
that fragments from intercepted cruise missiles could have rained
down on civilian areas.
	   Flight operations resumed Monday on the Enterprise and the
second U.S. carrier in Gulf, USS Carl Vinson, in anticipation of
restarting missions over southern Iraq to monitor the no-fly zone.

OSCE head urges point-by-point talks on Kosovo status
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Kosovo Albanians and Yugoslav authorities
ought to negotiate basics on the future status of Serbia's tense
province, rather than arguing about what that that status should be
called, the head of the Organization of Security and Cooperation in
Europe said Monday.
	   Bronislaw Geremek, who is also Poland's foreign minister, added
that both sides were equally reluctant to talk at all.
	   ``They ought to leave the political rhetoric and talk about
separate concrete problems (of Kosovo's future status) _ as
elections, police, schools , etc.,'' Geremek told a news conference
at the end of a two-day visit to Sofia. ``However both sides lack
even the minimum good will for negotiations.''
	   The problem of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs
nine to one, cannot be solved within Yugoslavia's main republic,
Serbia, Geremek said.
	   However world powers should try and encourage Serbs and
Albanians to negotiate a decision of their own instead of imposing
one on them, he said.
	   Serbia refuses to consider anything but limited authority for
Kosovo, while the province's ethnic Albanians want independence.

Opposition parliamentarians: IOC is no place for a prince
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The scandal-hit International
Olympic Committee is no place for Prince Willem-Alexander, heir to
the throne,Dutch opposition parliamentarians said Monday.
	   ``Recent reports prove again that the IOC is mixed up with
dubious practices,'' Paul Rosenmoeller, leader of the Green Left
party told the daily NRC Handelsblad newspaper. ``That is not the
ideal company for our future king.''
	   The IOC was plunged into crisis earlier this month when a senior
member publicly said the process of voting for future Olympic hosts
was marked by corruption and vote-buying. Switzerland's Marc Hodler
estimated that 5 to 7 percent of the 115 members are open to
bribery.
	   The IOC has launched an investigation into Salt Lake City's
successful bid to host the 2002 Winter Games. Salt Lake organizers
admit having a dlrs 400,000 scholarship fund for IOC members'
families but have said this was a humanitarian gesture rather than
bribery.
	   Rosenmoeller was supported by the Socialist Party, but members
of the three parties making up the ruling coalition said they
wanted to wait for the results of the IOC investigation before
debating the prince's IOC membership.
	   The sports-crazy prince was elected to the IOC at the Winter
Olympics in Nagano, Japan, but is only due to be officially
installed next June.
	   The Royal House declined comment on the prince's membership.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Iranian authors who said they escaped into exile
after being imprisoned and tortured appealed Monday to the United
Nations to intervene with Iran to protest the latest killing of
writers.
	   As part of a series of protests around Europe, a delegation of
the Association of Iranian Writers in Exile came to the U.N.
European headquarters to report on a string of slayings in Iran for
which they hold the government responsible.
	   Following the 1979 Iranian revolution, poets and other writers
have been executed in Iran, said Reza Allamehzadeh, a writer and
filmmaker based in the Netherlands.
	   He and other writers who live outside Iran said the latest
killings have gone beyond the pattern of ``writers under the
pressure of arrest and execution.''
	   ``What is different this time is that it's a string of killings
in a very cruel way,'' said Allamehzadeh, who led the delegation to
meet with U.N. human rights officials.
	   Fereidoun Gilani, a poet and former newspaper editor, said the
victims had been among six writers who were trying to reestablish
the writers group in Iran. All six were arrested and tortured, said
Gilani.
	   ``They let them go and they killed them from behind,'' he said.
	   Two of those slain, Mohammad Jafar Pouyandeh and Mohammad
Mokhtari, were summoned by a court two months ago for questioning
about their activities. Their bodies later were found dumped on the
outskirts of Tehran. They were apparently strangled.
	   The five slain people had criticized hard-line clergymen who
support Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and oppose
moderate President Mohammad Khatami's attempts at social and
political reforms.
	   But the writers delegation said they hold the entire government,
including Khatami, responsible.
	   ``This does not mean that we think Khatami is organizing
terrorists to kill, but it does mean he is in a position of
responsibility,'' said Allamehzadeh.

Archbishop protests against intolerance, corruption
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SNJEZANA VUKIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Echoing many opposition leaders,
Croatia's Roman Catholic primate criticized the rule of President
Franjo Tudjman, protesting Monday against intolerance, corruption
and injustice.
	   In his Christmas message, Archbishop Josip Bozanic said the
church won't side with any political party. But his address was a
sharp criticism _ however indirect _ of the ruling party.
	   Bozanic, who became the primate late last year, had captured
Croats' attention with last year's Christmas message, in which he
spoke against the ``sins'' committed by governing bodies.
	   His words have since become the mantra of Tudjman's critics and
polls consistently show the archbishop is the most popular and
influential person in Croatia, where 80 percent of its population
of 4.7 million are Roman Catholics.
	   Bozanic said Croats long desired their own state, but now that
they have it, ``a lack of sensitivity for the common good, justice,
responsibility and social fairness'' is apparent.
	   Bozanic warned against an extremely polarized society, in which
``the one who wins consider himself authorized to make decisions,
ignoring the reasons and arguments of others.''
	   Tudjman led Croatia to independence from former Yugoslavia in
1991, but his foes charge that his virtual one-party rule has
suppressed freedoms, ruined the economy and impoverished most
Croats.
	   Bozanic said some political parties claim they are the only ones
representing the interests of the nation, ``which can have negative
repercussions upon social peace.''
	   Tudjman often claims his party is the only force fighting for
national interests and working to guarantee Croatia's independence.
He regularly rejects criticism, and accuses critics of being
enemies of the state.
	   Bozanic said the ``psychosis of hostility'' is being created in
the society.
	   Tudjman's party, which dominates parliament, recently rejected a
thorough investigation of the intelligence service, which has been
implicated in a media scandal, and the review of the privatization
of state-owned industries.
	   Bozanic said only those who ``protect filthy personal or
collective interests'' fear outside review, and called for
examination of privatization.
	   Independent economists say privatization was used to enrich a
handful of entrepreneurs close to Tudjman's party.

Diamond-mining town falls in Sierra Leone rebel push
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Panic-stricken villagers and aid
workers were fleeing heavy artillery shelling Monday in towns near
the capital amid a rebel advance on West African intervention
troops defending Sierra Leone's government.
	   Lt. Col. Jimoh Okunlola, spokesman for the West African force
known as ECOMOG, said the town of Koidu, hub of Sierra Leone's
diamond trade about 180 miles (300 kilometers) northeast of
Freetown, had fallen to the Revolutionary United Front rebel
alliance in recent days.
	   ``We realized that if we repelled them there would have been a
lot of civilian casualties, so we made a tactical withdrawal,''
Okunlola said. ``We plan to gather the necessary logistics and
regroup.''
	   ECOMOG troops launched a heavy artillery barrage on rebel
positions near the towns of Sumbuya and Songo between 30 and 40
miles (50 and 65 kilometers) east of the capital, Okunlola said.
	   On the outskirts of Freetown, the thumping of mortars and rattle
of machine gun fire could be heard intermittently Sunday night,
when ECOMOG tightened a night curfew and patrolled beaches and
suburbs of the capital.
	   The fighting prompted aid workers with the missionary group
Adventist Development and Relief Agency to abandon a hospital and
rehabilitation camp for thousands of war amputees in the town of
Waterloo, about 20 miles (35 kilometers) east of Freetown.
	   Witnesses said thousands of refugees were trekking along the
highway linking the interior of this West African country with
Freetown, carrying their belongings on their heads and sleeping in
ditches.
	   Liberia's President Charles Taylor announced his government had
closed the border to Sierra Leone and tightened patrols along the
frontier. He warned humanitarian agencies to prepare for a
potential influx of refugees from Sierra Leone into Liberian border
towns.
	   Sierra Leone and Liberia have traded accusations of giving
support to each others' dissidents, who operate out of remote
jungle bases.
	   Neither government nor ECOMOG officials gave casualty figures
for the latest fighting. Together with the traditional Kamajor
militia group, ECOMOG has been authorized by the government to
carry out defense duties after the West African country's
rebellious military was dissolved earlier this year.
	   President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's government has been waging war
against members of Sierra Leone's ousted military junta and its
rebel allies since his reinstatement following 10 months in exile
during a period of junta rule that ended in February.
	   Thousands of people have been killed, raped and maimed by the
rebels in a sweeping revenge campaign against the government.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A storm of opposition from both foes and
friends of the new peace accord brought Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's government to the brink of collapse Monday.
	   Netanyahu, backed into a political corner, was expected to agree
to dissolve his government and call early elections to seek a
public mandate for his policies.
	   Israel's divided Knesset, or parliament, convened Monday evening
for what was expected to be lengthy debate on the faltering Wye
River land-for-security peace accord and the prime minister's
hard-line stance toward the Palestinians.
	   The fate of the government seemed sealed when Netanyahu's Likud
party announced it would call for elections to be held more than a
year ahead of schedule. The move signaled an about-face by
Netanyahu, who had previously concentrated on trying to hold his
fractious coalition together.
	   ``It's a sad day,'' declared Netanyahu's defense minister,
Yitzhak Mordechai. ``It's a day when the government decides on its
end, and the Knesset decides to dissolve itself.''
	   The Knesset's spectators' gallery was packed with dignitaries as
the session got under way. A sticker posted in the parliament's
halls read, ``Come on, Sara, let's go home'' _ referring to
Netanyahu's wife.
	   The hours beforehand were filled with last-minute political
dealmaking. Confused Knesset members wandered in an out of the
wood-and-stone plenum chamber, asking journalists if they knew what
agenda had been settled on.
	   Just before lawmakers convened, Israeli media said various
political parties had agreed to scrap a planned series of
no-confidence votes in order to move more quickly to debate on the
peace process and the measure to dissolve the government.
	   Netanyahu's handling of the peace process has drawn fire from
all sides in the two months since the signing of the U.S.-brokered
accords.

saying the prime minister never intended to live up to promises
made under the landmark Oslo accords signed by slain Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   Since Netanyahu took office in May 1996, the peace process has
been largely stalled. The signing of the Wye accords on Oct. 23 in
Washington represented a dramatic break in what had been a 19-month
deadlock.
	   The accord's right-wing opponents, among them Jewish settlers,
have expressed fury at Netanyahu for agreeing to hand over more
West Bank land to the Palestinians in exchange for security steps.
Previously, he had promised to fight any such concessions.
	   Setting the stage for a showdown, Netanyahu's Cabinet on Sunday
approved a tough set of conditions for resuming Israel's compliance
with the Wye accords. Netanyahu said he would hold a vote to check
lawmakers' views of that move.
	   Netanyahu says the conditions _ including a demand that Arafat
renounce his intentions to declare independence by the end of May _
are justified because the Palestinians have not met obligations
under the agreement.
	   The Palestinians rejected that and denounced the delays as
unfair and potentially dangerous.
	   ``If Wye is not carried forward, the situation in the coming few
weeks will be negative,'' said Marwan Bargouti, leader of Yasser
Arafat's Fatah faction. He said violent clashes could result.
	   The timetable on early elections will be important because of
constraints faced by a prime potential opponent, Lt. Gen. Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak.
	   Shahak, who has been on leave since stepping down as army chief
of staff in July, was to announce his retirement from the military
once elections were called.
	   Under law, Shahak would be banned from participating in politics
for 100 days after his departure from the armed forces. But with a
presidential dispensation, that could be shortened to 50 days.
	   Little is known of Shahak's policies. As a soldier, he is
prohibited from expressing an opinion, but his deep involvement in
the peace talks suggests he is a moderate who favors territorial
concessions.
	   Polls have suggested that a centrist bid by Shahak would likely
push Labor Party leader Ehud Barak out of the race in the first
round of voting and lead to a run-off between Netanyahu and Shahak.
	   Barak, whose party began the Israel-Palestinian peace process in
1993, told Israel TV a Shahak bid would be an ``unnecessary
division of strengths.''

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A storm of opposition from both foes and
friends of the new peace accord brought Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's government to the brink of collapse Monday.
	   Netanyahu, backed into a political corner, was expected to agree
to dissolve his government and call early elections to seek a
public mandate for his policies.
	   Israel's divided Knesset, or parliament, convened Monday evening
for what was expected to be lengthy debate on the faltering Wye
River land-for-security peace accord and prime minister's hardline
stance toward the Palestinians.
	   Early on, Netanyahu briefly addressed lawmakers and was heckled
by a right-wing lawmaker when he referred to terms for an Israeli
pullback from the West Bank.

party announced beforehand it would back calling elections more

Netanyahu, who had previously concentrated on trying to hold his

	   ``It's a sad day,'' declared Netanyahu's defense minister,
Yitzhak Mordechai. ``It's a day when the government decides on its
end, and the Knesset decides to dissolve itself _ it's of course a
very sad day.''
	   The Knesset's spectators' gallery was packed with dignitaries as
the political drama got under way. A sticker posted in the
parliament's halls read, ``Come on, Sara, let's go home'' _
referring to Netanyahu's wife.

Liberals capture majority of votes in St. Petersburg elections

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Liberal candidates capitalized on
voter anger over lawlessness in St. Petersburg, securing 24 of 50
seats in city council elections, according to preliminary results
Monday.
	   St. Petersburg, the country's second-largest city after Moscow,
has long had liberal leanings, though liberal groups nationwide
have been in disarray recently.
	   Sunday's runoff was seen as a test of their strength, and the
poll attracted nationwide attention after a leading liberal
politician was killed in the city last month.
	   Only six of the 50 seats were filled in the first round of
voting earlier this month. Sunday's turnout of about 32 percent was
marred by reports of election violations.
	   The vote didn't produce the sweeping victory many liberals
expected.
	   Three liberal parties captured a combined total of 24 seats in
both rounds of voting. Communist groups took five seats and
independents and smaller parties took the remaining 21, according
to the City Electoral Commission.
	   To the surprise of many analysts, the largest single bloc was
the liberal group led by Yuri Boldyrev, which won 15 seats. Some of
the independents were expected to side with liberals as well.
	   Observers said there were cases of vote buying and busing
pensioners to the election sites. Some losers immediately demanded
recounts.
	   Boldyrev candidate Oleg Sergeyev, who won a seat Sunday after
being beaten up during his campaign, welcomed the liberals' victory
as a triumph over ``image makers and criminal organizations'' who
tried to trick voters. Two other candidates appeared on the ballot
with Sergeyev's name, a tactic to confuse voters that was
widespread in this election.
	   ``These elections were trash,'' said taxi driver Oleg Kuznetsov.
``Somebody came to my house and offered me 35 rubles (dlrs 1.67) to
vote for somebody else, I forget who, I was so insulted.''
	   Disillusionment was widespread.
	   ``These elections went to hell,'' said Andrei Vavilov, a
49-year-old unemployed mechanic who didn't vote. Pointing at closed
or collapsing factories around him, he said politicians are too
busy squabbling among themselves to solve the city's real problems.
	   The new deputies will enter a city council that grants its
members a much stronger voice in local affairs than similar bodies
elsewhere in Russia.
	   The campaign leading up to the election was marred by intrigue
and violence. Attackers beat one candidate with metal rods, and the
windows of a city council member's apartment were shot out.
	   The most shocking event, however, was the death of Galina
Starovoitova, one of the country's leading liberal politicians. She
was killed by unidentified gunmen on Nov. 20 outside her St.
Petersburg apartment.
	   Some said Starovoitova's death galvanized St. Petersburg's 3.7
million voters, who seem fed up with the city's crime and
corruption and its poor economic performance. Others said her
slaying had little effect on voter turnout or results.
	   An aide to Starovoitova, Ruslan Linkov, was shot in the head in
the attack. He said Sunday's elections should have brought a
stronger victory for liberals.
	   ``Representatives from democratic parties should learn a lesson
and in the future should unite with a single candidate list,'' he
told reporters.

Burning of huts was political, African National Congress says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   IZINGOLWENI, South Africa (AP) _ African National Congress
officials on Monday blamed political rivals for the burning of 16
houses belonging to ANC supporters in this southern Indian Ocean
coastal area.
	   Police arrested four suspects and are investigating the alleged
arson, which occurred late Sunday afternoon, said police
Superintendent Dawood Kader.
	   Kader said he could not confirm the political connection, and
attributed the attack to ``criminal elements.''
	   The ANC said the houses belonged to seven families who had been
threatened by Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party supporters.
Inkatha's political base is in KwaZulu-Natal, which includes the
traditional Zulu homeland.
	   The two parties' violent political rivalry in the province
killed more than 10,000 people in the decade leading up to South
Africa's first all-race election in 1994.
	   Inkatha raids were supported by apartheid government security
forces seeking to destabilize the country.
	   The violence subsided after the vote, but still flares
sporadically. An increase in attacks is feared as the country
approaches its next national elections in 1999.
	   ``We are saying it was a political attack,'' said Bheki Cele, a
local ANC spokesman, in a telephone interview. ``The ANC people
were under attack by the Inkatha people.''
	   There were no deaths or injuries reported in the raids, which
happened over a period of about 40 minutes to widely scattered
houses on the outskirts of Port Edward, 180 kilometers (111 miles)
south of Durban.
	   Cele said some families vacated the houses before Sunday,
responding to threats over the past several days.
	   He charged that police ignored pleas by the ANC to give special
attention to this and several other potential hot spots during the
Christmas holidays.
	   The period is particularly volatile because many city-based
workers travel home to see families and celebrate. In 1995, 18
people died in a Christmas Day attack by 2,000 armed Inkatha
supporters in the village of Shobashobane.
	   Kader said he thought negotiations to settle violence in KwaZulu
over the past several years had born fruit.
	   ``I think we've passed the stage of political confrontation,''
Kader said. ``I think people are trying to get together.''

Maier leads sensational Austrian sweep
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Ams. RECASTS, UPDATES with detail, quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PATSCHERKOFEL, Austria (AP) _ Hermann Maier and his Austrian
teammates made ski history at the legendary Patscherkofel Olympic
course.
	   Maier, a double Olympic champion at Nagano, led an unprecedented
Austrian sweep of the top nine places in Monday's World Cup Super-G
to earn a place in the records book and in the hearts of Austrian
fans.
	   A huge crowd, including hundreds of children, went wild as the
home skiers swept away ``the rest of the world'' with an impressive
display of power and determination.
	   Never before in World Cup history skiers from the same country
had finished 1-9 in men's or women's races.
	   Maier's victory and the team triumph at the course which hosted
the 1976 Olympics definitely restored the prestige of Austria's
``Power Team'' coming from three consecutive setbacks in downhill
and giant slalom in northern Italy.
	   ``The Herminator'' clocked an unbeatable time of one minute,
23.52 seconds down the 1,947-meter long course, dropping 570
meters.
	   Christian Mayer and Fritz Strobl placed second and third
respectively for the all-Austrian podium in the third super giant
slalom race of the season.
	   Mayer trailed the winner by 0.76 seconds. Strobl was one
hundredth of a second back.
	   Fourth-place Stephan Eberharter, Rainer Salzgeber (5th) and Hans
Knauss (6th) were also split by just one hundredth.
	   The race, started 65 minutes late because fog had initially
hampered visibility, looked like the Austrian national
championships as late starters such Patrick Wirth and Werner Franz
helped to set up the sensational 1-9 finish.
	   The previous best team showing dated back to 1968, when French
women finished 1-6 in a downhill race at Abetone, Italy.
	   Austrian skiers already had swept the top five places in a
Super-G at Aspen, Colo. last month.
	   Norway's Lasse Paulsen was the first of the non-Austrian
finishers in tenth place, with a gap of 1.01 seconds.
	   Maier's third season victory _ the 13th of his World Cup career
- vaulted the strongly-built Austrian skier atop the overall
standings.
	   With 540 points after 12 races Maier led by three points
Norway's Lasse Kjus, the original Cup leader who slipped to second
place as he lagged 14th in Monday's race.
	   Mayer moved to third with 462 points, ahead of Eberharter.
	   Maier, the defending World Cup overall, Super-G and giant slalom
champion, also piled up a commanding lead of 280 points, to
Eberharter's 230, in the Super-G standings.
	   The Austrian superstar, twice fourth in the two previous races
in Val Gardena and Alta Badia, made acrobatics to avoid a spill at
mid course, when he hit the snow with a hand while clearing a gate.
	   ``It was a sensational race for me and for the team. We need
more races like this ... I skied miles away from the ideal line and
I struggled to win on this track, as Klammer did to achieve his
Olympic victory,'' Maier said.
	   Franz Klammer, a national hero who won the Olympic downhill
title at this course, was at the finish line to congratulate his
fellow-countrymen for their impressive showing.
	   Classes were closed in the Innsbruck area to allow children to
see their idols in action at the course often used by the Austrian
team as training site.
	   ``The course was perfect, and the fans gave me a big boost,''
Maier said. ``I just wanted to win here. This race was very special
to me.''
	   Strobl, who placed third starting with the No. 45 bib, said the
team success ``took a lot of pressure out of us.''
	   ``Third place also gives me a lot of morale for coming races. We
certainly have the best Super-G team,'' said Strobl.
	   The men's World Cup continues at Bormio, northern Italy, on Dec.
29. The Austrians will be shooting for their first downhill victory
in the fourth speed race of the season following six wins in the
three other disciplines of Alpine skiing.

Netanyahu said ready to dissolve government, go to early elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 4 with Netanyahu speaking briefly, being
heckled; ADDS last graf on preliminary approval for ending direct
elections for prime minister &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A storm of opposition from both foes and
friends of the new peace accord brought Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's government to the brink of collapse Monday.
	   Netanyahu, backed into a political corner, was expected to agree
to dissolve his government and call early elections to seek a
public mandate for his policies.
	   Israel's divided Knesset, or parliament, convened Monday evening
for what was expected to be lengthy debate on the faltering Wye
River land-for-security peace accord and the prime minister's
hard-line stance toward the Palestinians.
	   Early on, Netanyahu briefly addressed lawmakers and was heckled
by a right-wing lawmaker when he referred to terms for an Israeli
pullback from the West Bank.
	   The fate of the government seemed sealed when Netanyahu's Likud
party announced it would call for elections to be held more than a
year ahead of schedule. The move signaled an about-face by
Netanyahu, who had previously concentrated on trying to hold his
fractious coalition together.
	   ``It's a sad day,'' declared Netanyahu's defense minister,
Yitzhak Mordechai. ``It's a day when the government decides on its
end, and the Knesset decides to dissolve itself.''
	   The Knesset's spectators' gallery was packed with dignitaries as
the session got under way. A sticker posted in the parliament's
halls read, ``Come on, Sara, let's go home'' _ referring to
Netanyahu's wife.
	   The hours beforehand were filled with last-minute political
dealmaking. Confused Knesset members wandered in an out of the
wood-and-stone plenum chamber, asking journalists if they knew what
agenda had been settled on.
	   Just before lawmakers convened, Israeli media said various
political parties had agreed to scrap a planned series of
no-confidence votes in order to move more quickly to debate on the
peace process and the measure to dissolve the government.
	   Netanyahu's handling of the peace process has drawn fire from
all sides in the two months since the signing of the U.S.-brokered
accords.
	   Israel's left accuses Netanyahu of bad faith and foot-dragging,
saying the prime minister never intended to live up to promises
made under the landmark Oslo accords signed by slain Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   Since Netanyahu took office in May 1996, the peace process has
been largely stalled. The signing of the Wye accords on Oct. 23 in
Washington represented a dramatic break in what had been a 19-month
deadlock.
	   The accord's right-wing opponents, among them Jewish settlers,
have expressed fury at Netanyahu for agreeing to hand over more
West Bank land to the Palestinians in exchange for security steps.
Previously, he had promised to fight any such concessions.
	   Setting the stage for a showdown, Netanyahu's Cabinet on Sunday
approved a tough set of conditions for resuming Israel's compliance
with the Wye accords. Netanyahu said he would hold a vote to check
lawmakers' views of that move.
	   Netanyahu says the conditions _ including a demand that Arafat
renounce his intentions to declare independence by the end of May _
are justified because the Palestinians have not met obligations
under the agreement.
	   The Palestinians rejected that and denounced the delays as
unfair and potentially dangerous.
	   ``If Wye is not carried forward, the situation in the coming few
weeks will be negative,'' said Marwan Bargouti, leader of Yasser
Arafat's Fatah faction. He said violent clashes could result.
	   The timetable on early elections will be important because of
constraints faced by a prime potential opponent, Lt. Gen. Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak.
	   Shahak, who has been on leave since stepping down as army chief
of staff in July, was to announce his retirement from the military
once elections were called.
	   Under law, Shahak would be banned from participating in politics
for 100 days after his departure from the armed forces. But with a
presidential dispensation, that could be shortened to 50 days.
	   Little is known of Shahak's policies. As a soldier, he is
prohibited from expressing an opinion, but his deep involvement in
the peace talks suggests he is a moderate who favors territorial
concessions.
	   Polls have suggested that a centrist bid by Shahak would likely
push Labor Party leader Ehud Barak out of the race in the first
round of voting and lead to a run-off between Netanyahu and Shahak.
	   Barak, whose party began the Israel-Palestinian peace process in
1993, told Israel TV a Shahak bid would be an ``unnecessary
division of strengths.''
	   As Monday's session began, legislators gave preliminary approval
to a measure that would end direct elections for the prime
minister. However, it would not apply to upcoming elections.

U.S. officers: 72 percent bombs on target in Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABOARD THE USS ENTERPRISE (AP) _ Even using highly touted
laser-guided bombs, more than a quarter of the airstrikes launched
from the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise missed their main targets,
naval commanders said Monday.
	   But American officials praised the percentage as exceptionally
good and denied claims by Iraq that hospitals or other civilian
sites could have been hit by misdirected U.S. airstrikes.
	   ``I can say that everyone is very pleased with the success of
the airstrikes,'' said Rear Adm. J. Cutler Dawson Jr., commander of
the eight-vessel Enterprise battle group in the Gulf. ``This is an
impressive figure.''
	   The ship's air wing commander, Capt. Tom Hagen, told the
Enterprise crew that preliminary analyses showed 72 percent of the
airstrikes were on target.
	   Digital video images of all the airstrikes are getting a more
detailed review at Central Command in Tampa, Florida.
	   The success rate estimate did not take into account Tomahawk
cruise missile strikes and only included the more than 300 missions
flown off the Enterprise during the four nights of attacks. Another
350 sorties were flown off the ground, including B-2 and B-1
bombers and Britain's Tornado fighter-bombers.
	   ``This is excellent,'' said Hagen, who noted that a 50 percent
on-target rate is typical for fighter-bombers in a combat
situation.
	   The majority of the bombs fired by the F/A-18 and F-14 warplanes
were the so-called ``smart bombs'' fitted with laser-guided
navigation systems, weapons system chiefs said. The rest were
conventional bombs _ ranging from 500 pounds to 2,000 pounds (227
kilograms to 910 kilograms) _ that free fall from the planes.
Officers on the ship refused to give a precise breakdown of the
types used in the raids.
	   American officials have acknowledged that Iraq retains some of
its capability to produce weapons. And they have left open the
possibility that attacks could resume.
	   During the assault, 425 Tomahawk missiles were fired and Iraq
says it shot down more than 100 of them. Dawson said 325 Tomahawks
were fired from the ships in the Enterprise battle group. The
others were launched from B-2 bombers.
	   Officers and pilots on the Enterprise refused to speculate on
what could have been hit by bombs that missed the central targets.
	   Dawson insisted that no medical facilities or major civilian
areas were near the target sites, as claimed by President Saddam
Hussein's government.
	   ``This could have been done by Saddam's own anti-aircraft
fire,'' said Dawson. ``What goes up must come down.'' He also noted
that fragments from intercepted cruise missiles could have rained
down on civilian areas.
	   Flight operations resumed Monday on the Enterprise and the
second U.S. carrier in Gulf, USS Carl Vinson, in anticipation of
restarting missions over southern Iraq to monitor the no-fly zone.

France expects Germany to honor nuclear reprocessing contracts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ France expects Germany to honor nuclear
reprocessing contracts despite German moves to phase out nuclear
power, the Economics Ministry said Monday.
	   In a letter to German Economics Minister Werner Mueller, his
French counterpart Strauss-Kahn pointed to the financial and
economic repercussions of abandoning the contracts, the spokeswoman
said.
	   German Environment Minister Juergen Trittin wants nuclear
operators to end reprocessing contracts with the Britain's BNFL and
France's Cogema as part of plans to phase out nuclear power.
Germany ships nuclear waste to those countries for reprocessing.
	   Trittin says the move would be legally tenable, but Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder is worried about possible political consequences.
	   Schroeder's center-left government, which includes the
environmentalist Greens, took office in October saying it wants to
shut down the nation's 19 nuclear plants.
	   British, French and German officials met last week to discuss
the consequences of an immediate end to nuclear reprocessing
shipments.
	   Schroeder plans to open talks with Germany's nuclear power
industry next month on a shutdown timetable next month.
	   Before that, Schroeder's Social Democrats and the Greens hope to
agree on the future of reprocessing in Jan. 13 talks.
	   On Monday, a government spokesman dismissed as speculation a
German television report over the weekend that Schroeder had
reached an understanding to give power companies more than 20 years
to shut down nuclear plants.
	   In return for the longer grace period, the companies will
renounce their rights to damage claims for lost earnings, ZDF
television reported.
	   Other reports have mentioned a 20-year period, a timetable
Schoeder has supported.
	   Last week, the nuclear power industry called for a 40-year exit
period as the only way for the government to avoid damage claims,
which the industry has estimated at up to 50-80 billion marks (dlrs
30-48 billion.)

IMF sees less threat of worldwide recession
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARTIN CRUTSINGER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Economics Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The financial firestorm that began last year
in Asia and hit Russia this summer still poses severe threats, but
the dangers of a worldwide recession have eased in recent weeks,
the International Monetary Fund said Monday.
	   The IMF credited interest rate cuts in the United States and
elsewhere for helping to stabilize a situation that in August and
September was threatening to spiral out of control after Russia's
default on billions of dollars of foreign loans buffetted investors
from New York to Buenos Aires.
	   The 182-nation lending agency stressed in an updated ``World
Economic Outlook'' issued Monday that even with markets now
stabilized, the global economy faced numerous risks in 1999 and it
would be ``premature to consider the difficulties to be over.''
	   The financial turmoil that began in Thailand in 1997, then
spread to Russia this year and has threatened countries in Latin
America, has already pushed 40 percent of economies into a
downturn. That left Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
worrying in September how long the United States could remain ``an
oasis of prosperity'' in the face of such overseas turbulence.
	   The Fed began in September a series of three interest rate cuts
over seven weeks aimed at boosting domestic demand to offset the
loss of overseas markets for American manufacturers and farmers.
	   The new IMF report said, ``While the danger of a worldwide
recession does seem to have diminished, the supply of funds to most
emerging market economies is still sharply reduced and conditions
in financial markets remain fragile,'' the IMF said.
	   The IMF, in fact, trimmed its growth forecast for 1999,
projecting that world output of goods and services would rise by
just 2.2 percent. That compares to an assessment just two months
ago that the economy would expand bu 2.5 percent in 1999.
	   The IMF's forecast for 1998 was revised up slightly to 2.2
percent, compared to 2 percent in October, based in part on a
stronger-than-expected showing in the United States, where
consumers have kept the U.S. economy rolling despite the Asian
headwinds.
	   For the United States, the IMF's updated forecast predicted
growth of 3.6 percent this year, slightly better than the 3.5
percent forecast in October, but a foresaw a sharp slowdown in 1999
with growth of just 1.8 percent, 0.2 percentage points lower than
the October forecast.
	   Japan, the world's second largest economy, is struggling to
emerge from its worst recession in 50 years. The IMF was encouraged
with recent policy actions to deal with failing banks, but it still
predicted the Japanese economy would shrink by 2.8 percent this
year and another 0.5 percent in 1999. The 1999 outlook is a full
percentage point lower than October.
	   ``Japan's economic outlook remains particularly uncertain and
questions remain about the adequacy and implementation of recent
initiatives to turn the economy around,'' the IMF said.
	   The Clinton administration has argued that other hard-hit Asian
countries have no hope of mounting sustained recoveries unless
Japan takes more forceful action to deal with its own problems and
serve as an engine of growth for the region.
	   In addition to the threats posed by Japan sliding deeper into
recession, the IMF also expressed worries that developing countries
will have increasing trouble attracting the foreign capital they
need as investors look for less risky opportunities elsewhere.
	   Also listed as threats were the possibility that the U.S. stock
market, which has climbed to new highs after its August swoon,
could be caught in another downdraft that could prompt American
consumers to pull back on their spending.
	   The IMF has assembled more than dlrs 100 billion in emergency
rescue loans for Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, Russia and last
month, Brazil. But the agency itself has come under attack from
critics who have charged that its brand of belt-tightening
austerity measures have made the economic recessions in the crisis
countries worse and failed to halt the spread of the market turmoil
to more nations.
	   IMF officials did not respond directly to the criticism in the
outlook report, but the agency's economists did note that in South
Korea, Thailand and more recently Indonesia, the economic reform
packages have ``achieved considerable success in re-establishing
financial stability.''

Parliament accepts Turabi's resignation as speaker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Sudan's Parliament on Monday accepted the
resignation of its speaker as part of a political shuffle that is
not expected to reduce his role as the most influential person in
the country.
	   The 400-seat Parliament has accepted the resignation of Hassan
Turabi, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported from the Sudanese
capital of Khartoum. It gave no other details. The report could not
be immediately confirmed.
	   The resignation must now be approved by President Omar
el-Bashir, but that also is considered a formality.
	   Turabi had announced his resignation on Dec. 2 to work full time
for the governing National Congress party, whose monopoly on
politics will end next year under a law passed Dec. 9.
	   The Political Associations Law, which comes into effect Jan. 1,
allows for the formation of political groups that may contest
elections.
	   El-Bashir, who banned all political parties after seizing power
in a 1989 military coup, said recently that the door was open for
opposition figures in exile to come back and form political
associations.
	   But the presence of the hard-line Turabi at the head of
Parliament had cast doubts on the seriousness of the government's
willingness to allow the opposition to flourish. Political analysts
interpreted Turabi's resignation as a government attempt to ease
those fears.
	   However, there is still some apprehension because the new law
only speaks of ``political associations.'' Turabi was strongly
opposed to some Parliament members' demand for a clear-cut
reference to ``political parties.''

Brazil loses World Cup; bribes scandal in England; Blatter takes
</HEADLINE>
over &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ France was expected to be a great host. It wasn't
supposed to beat Brazil and win the World Cup, too.
	   Zinedine Zidane, with his two goals, eclipsed Ronaldo as the
French outplayed the Brazilians 3-0 at the Stade de France to give
soccer a new and unexpected world champion.
	   It was a year when few things really went as expected.
	   Soccer in 1998 had all the big names dominating the headlines
but usually for the wrong reasons.
	   A doping scandal exploded in Italy's Serie A after a top coach
suggested some players were taking performance-enhancing
substances, and leading officials were put under investigation for
allegedly hiding the results of positive tests.
	   The World Cup gave Ronaldo the chance to prove why he's the best
player in the world. Yet, apparently hit by a mystery illness on
the day of the final, he was virtually anonymous during the match.
He also performed intermittently during the year for Inter Milan.
	   Heavily favored Brazil had so many stars at the World Cup that
coach Mario Zagallo couldn't make them play together. They got to
the final and fizzled out.
	   By contrast, the French gave a skeptical public their first
World Cup title and united a nation which wasn't sure it wanted the
competition in the first place.
	   In terms of performance, South Africa, Japan and Jamaica made
their World Cup debuts expecting to reflect advances on soccer back
home. Like some more familiar names, including the United States,
they all went home early and FIFA, hoping the late stages of the
competition would have a more worldwide look, saw it boil down to
Europe vs. South America once again.
	   Croatia, having made the finals in its first attempt,
surprisingly reached the final four, ousting powerhouse Germany 3-0
along the way, before losing to the French.
	   The surprises continued at club level.
	   Favored Juventus reached its third straight European Champions
Cup final but lost to Real Madrid, which won the title for the
seventh time but first since 1966.
	   Manchester United, once 12 points clear of rival Arsenal in the
English league, completely fell apart with manager Alex Ferguson
concentrating on the Champions Cup. The team won neither, and
Arsenal made United's misery even worse by winning the FA Cup, too,
to earn the prestigious double under respected French coach Arsene
Wenger.
	   Kaiserslautern won the German Bundesliga after gaining promotion
from the lower division the previous season and Lens won the French
league for the first time in its history.
	   The FIFA presidency changed hands with Joao Havelange stepping
down after 24 years. There was a surprise here too because the job
went to its 62-year-old Swiss secretary-general Sepp Blatter, who
stepped into the race at the late stages. UEFA president Lennart
Johansson, who once believed himself the only candidate, was left
the loser.
	   Big business made an impact too.
	   Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB made a 623 million pound (dlrs 1 billion)
bid for Manchester United, a move that prompted other companies to
prepare similar bids for clubs such as Newcastle and Arsenal. All
are on hold pending a decision by a government appointed body
whether the BSkyB bid breaches the rules of fair trading.
	   Faced by the threat of a breakway Super League of Europe's major
clubs, UEFA decided to expand its Champions Cup and merge the UEFA
and Cup winners Cups into one. After hearing how much money that
would generate for them, the clubs pledged their loyalty.
	   The English Football Association was plunged into the biggest
scandal in its 135-year history in December over a 3.2 million
pound (dlrs 5 million) loan to its Welsh counterpart.
	   The money was interpreted as a cash-for-votes deal because
English FA chairman Keith Wiseman wanted the Welsh to support him
in a FIFA-UEFA election. Though declaring innocence, chief
executive Graham Kelly quit. Wiseman refused to go, while the
scandal was considered a major blow to England's bid to stage the
2006 World Cup.
	   At least some things went according to plan.
	   A France-Brazil final in Paris was the ideal finale to a
colorful World Cup in which goal-chances thankfully outnumbered
even a huge increase in red and yellow cards. Referees were ordered
to expel defenders who fouled from behind and the move appeared to
work with more action in front of the goal.
	   While Real Madrid downed Juventus in the Champions Cup, Chelsea,
coached by Gianluca Vialli who stepped in after Ruud Gullit stunned
the club by quitting in February, beat probably the weakest ever
field to win the Cup Winners Cup.
	   Vialli's team edged Stuttgart 1-0 in the final in Goteborg,
Sweden, while Italy at least claimed the UEFA Cup final, with
Internazionale of Milan downing Lazio of Rome 3-0.
	   Brazil's Vasco da Gama won South America's Copa Libertadores,
beating Ecuador's Barcelona 2-0 and 2-1 in the two-leg final only
to lose 1-0 to Real Madrid in Tokyo in the Toyota Cup.
	   Despite the Americans losing all three games at the World Cup,
including a 2-1 disappointment to Iran in the most politically
charged match of the tournament, the United States regained some of
its pride later in the year. Two-time Major League Soccer champion
D.C. United upset Mexico's Toluca for the CONCACAF Champions Cup
and then stunned Brazil's Vasco da Gama in a two-game showdown for
the Interamerican Cup.
	   Of the coaches in the headlines, England's Glenn Hoddle was
ridiculed in the media for his use of a faith healer but at least
kept his job. Brazil dismissed Zagallo, Italy dropped Cesare
Maldini and Saudi Arabia got rid of Carlos Alberto Parreira even
before the first round of the World Cup was completed. Meanwhile,
Roma's Zdenek Zeman caused the doping furor in Italy by accusing
some players of taking performance-enhancing drugs.
	   England's Michael Owen was probably the best newcomer, becoming
his country's youngest goalscorer and then netting one of the best
goals of the World Cup with a solo dribble against Argentina.

 &UR; Tensions raise as Serbian police retaliate against ethnic Albanians
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES with more details from Clark's visit, clashes in
Podujevo, more quotes from Serbian interior minister. no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police swept down on a
Kosovo Albanian stronghold Monday in retaliation for the killing of
one of their officers, despite NATO threats to intervene in the
troubled province.
	   The death of the Serbian policeman in Podujevo, 40 kilometers
(25 miles) north of Pristina, and the Serb response, ratchets up
the chances of a return to all-out war in the troubled Serbian
province.
	   NATO's top commander in Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark, held brief
talks Monday in Belgrade with the Serb-led Yugoslav army chiefs,
the U.S. embassy in Belgrade said.
	   Clark's visit comes amid escalating violence in Kosovo where
majority ethnic Albanians have been fighting for secession.
	   Sources close to the talks said that Clark repeated earlier NATO
warnings that the alliance might intervene if the fighting between
Serbian security forces and ethnic Albanian rebels didn't stop.
	   The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic signed a U.S.-sponsored
deal last October, promising a cease-fire and agreeing to deploying
up to 2,000 international verifiers to monitor the truce.
	   The government-run Media Center reported a 52-year-old
policeman, Milic Jovic, was mortally wounded by unknown assailants
in Podujevo early Monday. A woman who was accompanying Jovic was
wounded in the leg, the center said.
	   Podujevo is an overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian town near central
Serbia. Tensions there have risen in past weeks, as local Serbs
complained of a growing guerrilla presence and demanded the
government protect them.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources in Podujevo, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said a police sweep followed the morning shooting. The
Kosovo Information Center, close to the Albanian leadership, said
the town was sealed off while Serb police brought in
reinforcements. Sporadic shooting could be heard from an area
northeast of the town, the center said.
	   Hysen Fazliu, a spokesman for the main ethnic Albanian party in
Podujevo, said that the Serbian forces clashed with rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army and that an unspecified number of ethnic Albanians
have been arrested.
	   Jovic's killing is the latest in a series of setbacks for
Kosovo's fragile truce. It is certain to enrage the Serbs, already
furious over last week's killings of six Serb youths in a Kosovo
bar and a prominent Serb official.
	   The incident came a day after the KLA buried 33 fighters killed
last week in a border clash with the Yugoslav army.
	   The attack on Jovic also heightens fears that violence in Kosovo
is moving from the rugged countryside to the towns.
	   Several hundred Serbs staged a rally Monday in Kosovo Polje, a
few kilometers (miles) west of Pristina, demanding protection
against what they say is increasing danger from the ethnic
Albanians.
	   The angry crowd booed and jeered as Serbia's interior minister,
Vlajko Stojiljkovic, declared ``terrorism has been defeated'' and
``only gangs of criminals are left out in the field.''
	   Stojilkovic also vowed ``a resolute fight for the final
destruction of the terrorists and the protection of (Serbia's)
sovereignty and territorial integrity.''
	   The previous Serb crackdown against Kosovo Albanian separatists
launched last February claimed over 1,000 lives and forced some
300,000 people from their homes. The campaign also brought threats
of NATO airstrikes until Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
reached an agreement to defuse the crisis.
	   But attempts to follow that up with a detailed plan for the
province's longterm future have failed so far because the two sides
are so far apart. Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the
population, want independence while Serbia refuses to give up
control over its southern province.
	   Serbia is the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   In neighboring Albania, the government called Monday on all
Kosovo Albanian factions to unite and offered to host talks between
the KLA and followers of moderate ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova. There was no immediate response from the two camps.
	   Albania's interior ministry also said Serb border guards opened
fire early Saturday on Albanian troops along the tense border.
International observers reported similar incidents.
	   Kosovo Albanian rebels operate from sanctuaries in Albania.

	   NUREMBERG, Germany (AP) _ FC Nuremberg on Monday appointed
Friedel Rausch its new coach and gave him the job of trying to save
the struggling Bundesliga club from relegation.
	   Rausch, who was fired from bottom-placed Borussia
Moenchengladbach in November, takes over from Willi Reimann.
	   Reimann resigned Dec. 2 to spend more time with his ill wife.
	   Rausch, 58, was given a contract until the end of the season.
	   ``I am going to Nuremberg with great optimism,'' Rausch said.
``I believe I can save the club from relegation. The club has
future and substance.''
	   Nuremberg is second-to-last in the 18-team Bundesliga, which
began its two-month winter break Monday.

Treason charges for failed coup dropped against Zambian leaders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ State prosecutors dropped treason charges
on Monday against two politicians _ Dean Mung'omba and Nakatindi
Wina _ accused of involvement in a failed coup.
	   Chief prosecutor Mukelebai Mukelebai entered a plea of ``nolle
prosequi,'' the term in Zambian law for no prosecution, in the High
Court in Lusaka, effectively withdrawing charges against the two.
	   Mung'omba, head of the small opposition Zambia Democratic
Congress party, and Wina, a wealthy tribal princess and former
leader of the ruling party women's league, were freed on bail last
week.
	   They spent a year in jail after their arrest for alleged
involvement in an abortive coup attempt by junior military officers
in October 1997.
	   The charges carried a possible death sentence.
	   Last week, Judge Japhet Banda ruled that none of 109 witnesses
called by the state since the trial began six months ago had
implicated Mung'omba and Wina in the plot to overthrow President
Frederick Chiluba.
	   On Monday, he refused the prosecutor's request to call three
more witnesses who would allegedly link the politicians to the
plot.
	   Mung'omba and Wina appeared in the same trial as 77 soldiers
accused of staging the coup that was quickly crushed by loyal
troops.
	   Both denied accusations they planned and bankrolled the plot.
Mung'omba alleged he was tortured while in custody.
	   ``It is clear the state had no evidence against the two and it
was wrong for them (the state) to insist on continuing with the
case against them when they had no evidence,'' the judge said.
	   He said prosecutors had abused their power.
	   Last week's dlrs 2,500 bail conditions now fall away.
	   Mung'omba, an economist and former banker, served as a deputy
finance minister in Chiluba's government until he quit to form his
own opposition group.
	   Earlier this month, Wina was expelled from Chiluba's ruling
Movement for Multiparty Democracy party.
	   Former President Kenneth Kaunda was arrested on Christmas Day
1997 and charged with knowing about the coup plot but failing to
notify authorities. He was released from house arrest on June 1
when all charges were dropped.

Berlin tightens security after Jewish cemetery blast
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS grafs 2-3 to clarify that memorial slab was blown up,
Werthebach is city official. Pick up 4th graf 1st Ld &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Berlin authorities ordered tighter security at the
city's Jewish sites Monday after a bomb blast destroyed the grave
of a former German Jewish leader.
	   City officials said there were no immediate suspects in the
Saturday night attack, which blew up the marble memorial slab on
Heinz Galinski's grave in a Jewish cemetery in western Berlin.
	   Berlin's interior minister, Eckart Werthebach, said the
home-made bomb was packed into the steel cap of a gas canister for
maximum explosive impact.
	   Galinski headed Germany's Central Council of Jews from 1988
until his death in 1992. He had headed Berlin's Jewish community
since 1949.
	   Ignatz Bubis, who succeeded Galinski as head of the central
council, visited the gravesite Monday and blamed the attack on
rightist extremists. Federal agents were helping investigate the
bombing as a potential political crime.
	   A similar attack on Galinski's grave three months ago caused
minor damage. Police have no suspects in that explosion.
	   Police patrols at the cemetery in Charlottenburg district and
other Jewish sites in Berlin now are being stepped up, said
interior spokesman Martin Strunden.
	   Many Germans reacted with horror to the attack.
	   Volker Beck, a lawmaker for the Greens party, said it showed
anti-Semitism continued to fester in the country.
	   In a telegram earlier to Galinski's wife Ruth, President Roman
Herzog called the attack ``the result of crazy minds and the work
of confused loners,'' and said he wanted to express his sadness and
pain for himself and the Germans.

Little girl stabbed with drug needle in unprovoked attack

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A 10-year-old girl was stabbed by a drug
addict wielding a hypodermic needle in an attack that has sent
chills and fury through the country.
	   The attack, which occurred over the weekend, was the top story
in many Norwegian newspapers Monday. The story underlines concerns
that crime is increasing in Oslo, long noted as one of the world's
safest major cities.
	   The attack took place Sunday in a downtown Oslo shopping mall,
where the girl and her mother were buying Christmas presents.
According to reports, a man known to be a drug addict approached
without warning and stabbed the girl with a used needle.
	   The girl will require tests to determine if the girl has been
infected with the HIV virus. The virus, which causes AIDS, is often
transmitted through the shared use of hypodermic needles by
intravenous drug users.
	   Norway's largest newspaper, Verdens Gang, expressed the anger of
many in an editorial noting that the alleged attacker had been
arrested a few hours earlier at the same mall.
	   An apparent increase in unprovoked violence in the traditionally
peaceful Norwegian capital of 500,000 people has brought a recent
public outcry for stricter law enforcement.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.S. and British airstrikes disrupted the
distribution of supplies under the U.N.-approved oil-for-food
program, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Iraq said Monday.
	   The coordinator, Hans von Sponeck, also confirmed an earlier
report that a U.N. warehouse full of rice was destroyed and said it
was in the city of Tikrit.
	   Tikrit, the home town of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, is 170
kilometers (106 miles) north of Baghdad.
	   The warehouse, managed by the U.N. World Food Program, held
2,600 tons of rice, a WFP spokesman, Trevor Rowe, said in Rome.

Crimean Tatars demonstrate for more rights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Nearly 1,000 Crimean Tatars demonstrated
Monday against the proposed constitution for Ukraine's Crimean
peninsula, arguing that it doesn't guarantee rights for their
ethnic group.
	   The protesters called on Ukraine's parliament not to approve the
Crimean constitution until it incorporates provisions that would
guarantee Tatars representation in Crimea's legislature and support
for developing the Crimean Tatar language.
	   Soviet dictator Josef Stalin exiled Crimea's mostly Muslim
Tatars to Central Asia in 1944 for allegedly collaborating with
Nazi Germany. About 260,000 Tatars have returned to Crimea, their
historical homeland, in the past decade and many complain of
discrimination, especially in hiring and obtaining citizenship.
	   The Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine's legislature, rejected the Crimean
constitution last week after some lawmakers argued that it
contained separatist provisions. Deputies are to vote on the
document again Tuesday.
	   The constitution would give Crimea legal confirmation of its
status as Ukraine's only autonomous republic, and would spell out
the authority of the peninsula's government and legislature.
	   The Tatar protesters said they were not satisfied with the
constitution since it didn't mention the rights of Tatars, meaning
the larger Russian and Ukrainian populations would have a
``monopoly status in the political, economic and cultural life of
the peninsula,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Crimea, a Black Sea resort region of more than 2.5 million
people, is populated mostly by Russians and Ukrainians.
	   Hundreds of Tatars clashed with Ukrainian police earlier this
year during election rallies to demand voting rights for
non-citizens and a representation quota in Crimea's parliament.
	   Crimea belonged to Russia until Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev
gave it to then-Soviet Ukraine in 1954.
	   Since the 1991 Soviet collapse, Ukraine's federal government has
wrangled with pro-Russian Crimean authorities who want more
independence for the peninsula and closer ties with Moscow.

U.N. diplomat says talks on East Timor are moving forward slowly

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - As a U.N. envoy trotted toward an
Indonesian army helicopter, East Timorese protesters spilled onto
the runway tarmac and shouted their anger at nervous soldiers.
	   Sent to make peace in Indonesian-controlled East Timor, Jamsheed
Marker's recent hasty departure from the troubled territory
signaled how easily tensions there can boil over.
	   Yet Marker, who is visiting Indonesia to promote a U.N.-designed
blueprint for autonomy in the former Portuguese colony, said Monday
that both sides in the bitter conflict were displaying a newfound
taste for compromise.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press, Marker admitted that
a peaceful solution remains distant. But in a big step forward, he
said, many separatist activists were no longer pressing for an
immediate vote on independence.
	   ``They don't want independence tomorrow,'' said Marker, who was
interviewed in a Jakarta hotel suite after his trip to East Timor.
	   In other progress, Indonesia and Portugal will send diplomats to
open ``interest'' sections in each other's capitals next month.
Formal diplomatic relations, however, will not be resumed.
	   Also in January, the two countries are scheduled to embark on a
new round of U.N.-sponsored peace talks in New York.
	   Turmoil has plagued East Timor ever since Indonesian troops
invaded in 1975, unleashing a separatist rebel war and the
resentment of a population pummeled by human rights abuses.
	   Talks were revived earlier this year after the ouster of
authoritarian President Suharto, but differences remain over a
definition of autonomy that would suit all parties.
	   Separatists want it to be transitional, while Indonesia is
offering East Timorese partial control of their affairs in exchange
for international recognition of its sovereignty. Jakarta wants to
handle foreign, defense and financial affairs.
	   Fears are widespread that more unrest in East Timor could derail
the negotiations. On Monday, Marker voiced his concern in a meeting
with East Timor's jailed rebel chief, Xanana Gusmao.
	   ``I said there was a lot of tension in East Timor and that he
and his people ought to do everything they can to reduce it,'' said
Marker, a former Pakistani ambassador to the United Nations.
	   Tempers flared but there was no violence during protests timed
for Marker's weekend trip to Dili, the seaside capital of the
half-island territory of 800,000 people.
	   On Sunday, separatist protesters tore down a fence at the
commercial airport and pushed past soldiers with automatic rifles
as they tried in vain to speak to Marker as he left.
	   During a visit last year, Indonesian soldiers killed two
pro-independence demonstrators outside a hotel where Marker was
staying.
	   Activists have alleged that Indonesia secretly ferried troops
into East Timor in spite of pledges to reduce the number. Marker
said Jakarta had advised him of troop rotations and that U.N. staff
were monitoring the situation.
	   Marker was scheduled to talk with Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie on Tuesday and will leave Indonesia on Wednesday to prepare
for another batch of meetings in the New Year.
	   ``If you ask me... `Do you have a solution?' then the answer is,
`I don't,''' he said. ``But I think there are ways of getting there
and the first thing is to have peace and quiet.''

Archbishop protests against intolerance, corruption

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Echoing many opposition leaders,
Croatia's Roman Catholic primate criticized the rule of President
Franjo Tudjman, protesting Monday against intolerance, corruption
and injustice.
	   In his Christmas message, Archbishop Josip Bozanic said the
church would not back any political party. But his address was a
sharp criticism _ however indirect _ of the ruling party.
	   Bozanic, who became the primate late last year, had captured
Croats' attention with last year's Christmas message, in which he
spoke against the ``sins'' committed by governing bodies.
	   His words have since become the mantra of Tudjman's critics and
polls consistently show the archbishop is the most popular and
influential person in Croatia, where 80 percent of its population
of 4.7 million are Roman Catholics.
	   Bozanic said Croats long desired their own state, but now that
they have it, ``a lack of sensitivity for the common good, justice,
responsibility and social fairness'' is apparent.
	   Bozanic warned against an extremely polarized society, in which
``the one who wins considers himself authorized to make decisions,
ignoring the reasons and arguments of others.''

Prince Philip lays wreath to mark 10th anniversary of Pan Am crash

	   LOCKERBIE, Scotland (AP) _ The husband of Queen Elizabeth II
laid a wreath in this tiny town's cemetery Monday to mark the 10th
anniversary of the crash of Pan Am Flight 103, felled by a bomb
hidden in a suitcase.
	   Before Prince Philip's symbolic gesture to honor the 270 dead on
a bitterly cold, rainy day, Lockerbie's Roman Catholic parish
priest at the time of the crash spoke to about 200 victims'
relatives and townspeople about the ``ticking bomb'' of justice.
	   ``Ten years ago, for you and for us, a bomb was ticking,'' the
Rev. Pat Keegans told the crowd, many of them visibly moved. ``Be
assured of this _ there is another bomb ticking _ the irresistible
bomb of justice and truth.
	   ``Be certain that our wreath-laying today is not a symbolic
gesture. It is a declaration that we will not rest until we have
justice and truth, until all who are responsible for your deaths
are held accountable,'' he said.
	   Two Libyan suspects have been indicted in connection with the
bombing, but have not yet been turn over for trial.
	   Later Monday, a low-key memorial service was planned at
Lockerbie's Dryfesdale Church beginning at 7:03 p.m. (1903 GMT),
the moment when the plane hit the ground.
	   Other services were scheduled at the same moment at London's
Westminster Abbey and in Arlington, Virginia, where a memorial to
the dead has been erected, and Syracuse, New York, which lost 35
college students in the crash.
	   ``Most of the people I have spoken to are prepared to live with
their memories,'' the Rev. David Almond, the Church of Scotland
minister who organized Lockerbie's service, said of the local
citizens.
	   ``But just as they rallied round at the time, they see the
sensitivities of having a commemorative service,'' he said.
	   Bert Ammerman of River Vale, New Jersey, whose brother Thomas
died in the crash, said he felt compelled to be in Lockerbie for
the anniversary.
	   ``I knew I had to be here with people I've become so close to,''
said Ammerman, head of a group called Terrorism Watch Pan Am 103.
	   Lockerbie lost 11 of its own people, along with the 259
passengers and crew aboard Flight 103, which had just reached its
cruising altitude of 31,000 feet (9,400 kms) on Dec. 21, 1988, 42
minutes after taking off from London's Heathrow Airport for New
York.
	   The 366,228-pound (166,210-kg) aircraft was felled by a small
amount of high explosives smuggled on in a portable radio hidden
inside a suitcase, which made its way as checked baggage from Malta
to Frankfurt, Germany, and then to London.
	   Last week, Libya's Parliament gave its conditional approval for
a trial in the Netherlands by a Scottish court of two Libyan
suspects, but said some obstacles remained. Its statement made no
mention of whether Libya would hand over the two men.
	   Libya is demanding guarantees the men be jailed in Libya if
convicted, but the United States and Britain insist they serve any
prison terms in Britain.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to UPGRADE to Netanyahu decision to go to early
elections if peace policies not backed &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A storm of opposition from both foes and
friends of the new peace accord brought Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's government to the brink of collapse Monday.
	   Netanyahu, backed into a political corner, was expected to agree
to dissolve his government and call early elections to seek a
public mandate for his policies.
	   Israel's divided Knesset, or parliament, convened Monday evening
for what was expected to be lengthy debate on the faltering Wye
River land-for-security peace accord and prime minister's hardline
stance toward the Palestinians.
	   Early on, Netanyahu briefly addressed lawmakers and was heckled
by a right-wing lawmaker when he referred to terms for an Israeli
pullback from the West Bank.
	   Netanyahu said that if the Knesset failed to back his withdrawal
terms, he would back an early elections bill also scheduled for a
vote on Monday.
	   ``Most of the country supports our policies,'' Netanyahu said.
``If the Knesset doesn't support them, we will turn to the people
and ask them to support it.''
	   He indicated he would consult with the opposition on an
appropriate date for elections in that case.
	   ``It's a sad day,'' Netanyahu's defense minister, Yitzhak
Mordechai, declared earlier. ``It's a day when the government
decides on its end, and the Knesset decides to dissolve itself _
it's of course a very sad day.''

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.S. and British airstrikes disrupted the
distribution of supplies under the U.N.-approved oil-for-food
program, but officials said Monday they planned to return to Iraq
after being evacuated last week.
	   Food warehouses were destroyed in the attacks, and the
evacuation of U.N. workers prior to the airstrikes left only
essential personnel in place to administer the program, U.N.
Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq Hans von Sponeck told The
Associated Press.
	   ``Our program has been severely curtailed,'' he said.
	   Sponeck also confirmed an earlier report that a U.N. warehouse
full of rice was destroyed and said it was in the city of Tikrit,
the home town of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, 170 kilometers (106
miles) north of Baghdad.

EU seeks WTO panel after US publishes list of sanctioned products
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with EU reaction to U.S. list
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union's Foreign Trade
Commissioner Leon Brittan said the EU will push for a World Trade
Organization solution to its banana dispute with the United States
after Washington unveiled a list of EU goods subject to stiff trade
sanctions.
	   ``As a result of the publication of the U.S. list today, the EU
will accelerate its moves in the WTO for consultations leading to a
panel against US unilateral measures under Section 301 of the U.S.
Trade Act,'' Brittan said in a statement.
	   ``It is time to take action against the pernicious and unlawful
effect of this wholly unilateral legislation,'' he said.
	   Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act effectively allows the U.S.
government to determine whether its trade partners are unfairly
protecting their markets, and to impose retaliatory measures.
	   On Monday the United States published a list of EU products
ranging from sheep's milk cheese to cashmere sweaters that will be
slapped with 100 percent import tariffs.
	   U.S Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said in Washington
the United States is exercising its rights under the WTO to impose
penalties on the EU for, in the U.S. view, unfairly blocking U.S.
companies from selling bananas from Latin America to Europe.
	   But Brittan lashed out at the sanctions, saying, ``it is
difficult to think of a more obvious breach of the multilateral
trade system than to take the law into your own hands in defiance
of the rules.''
	   The United States argues the EU has not done enough to fall in
line with a WTO verdict last year which ruled against the EU's
favorable treatment of a number of African, Caribbean, and Pacific
region countries.
	   The EU says it approved new import regulations to comply with
WTO demands, but the United States and Central and South American
banana producers claim its banana import regime is still
discriminatory.
	   The U.S. sanctions could go into effect as soon as Feb. 2, or as
late as March 3, depending on whether the European Union chooses to
arbitrate the content of the list.

Daimler-Chrysler ad to wave down micro-compact Smart cars for test
</HEADLINE>
drive backfires &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Germans could wave down a new
micro-compact car in the street for free test drives Monday, but
Stuttgart taxi drivers weren't amused.
	   Some 20 two-seat Smart cars circulating in the city were
stopping for people hailing them at taxi stands, said Peter
Kristan, a spokesman for local taxi operators.
	   ``It's a promotion stunt to the detriment of our business,'' he
said.
	   Kristan said he was especially upset because Smarts are made by
a unit of Daimler-Chrysler, which also makes the pale yellow
Mercedes taxis that are a fixture on German streets.
	   He said the taxi operators were calling a protest strike of
several hours Tuesday.
	   Daimler-Chrysler placed ads in newspapers around Germany for
people to wave down Smart cars marked with a waving hand for a
30-minute test ride.
	   A Daimler-Chrysler spokesman said the promotion was not aimed at
stealing customers from taxis. ``We beg them to accept our
apologies if this has led to some irritation,'' he said.
	   According to the Smart's maker, Micro Compact Car, some 880 of
the specially marked cars were operating in Germany, and no
complaints had been received from other cities.

Kyrgyzstan sets up hot lines for reports on corruption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Authorities in Kyrgyzstan are setting up hotlines
for those willing to report official corruption in the central
Asian nation, a news report said Monday.
	   Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev also set up a panel of top
officials to coordinate the fight against graft, the Interfax news
agency reported. The panel will oversee investigation of all
corruption charges in the former Soviet republic.
	   The report gave no details about the hotlines.
	   According to Prosecutor General Asanbek Shirshenaliyev, 383
Kyrgyz officials, most in low-level jobs, have been dismissed over
the past five years over corruption charges.
	   The fight against corruption made it to the upper echelons
earlier this month, when three deputy ministers and several other
senior government officials were arrested and charged with
corruption.
	   Akayev has been stepping up efforts to crack down on
bribe-taking, embezzling and other corruption.
	   But Finance Minister Talaibek Koichumanov criticized police for
making highly publicized arrests in haste just to look good. ``The
good cause initiated by the president has been implemented very
incompetently,'' he said, according to Interfax.

Probe finds no health risks in hangar where crash wreckage lay
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Investigators said Monday they
could not link health problems suffered by some KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines staff to their work in a hangar that held wreckage of an
El Al Boeing 747 that crashed in 1992.
	   The independent four-month investigation was launched after KLM
employees complained of fatigue, nausea and breathing problems
after working in the hangar at Schiphol Airport.
	   The KLM employees blamed working next to the El Al wreckage for
their health problems. But investigators from the Netherlands
Organization for Applied Scientific Research said they found no
chemicals in high enough concentrations to pose a health risk.
	   The researchers based their findings on dust samples taken from
the hangar.
	   The El Al's cargo remains controversial more than six years
after the jet plowed into an apartment block on Oct. 4, 1992.
Residents in the neighborhood where the plane came down also have
complained of health problems they link to the crash.
	   It was recently revealed that the Israel-bound plane was
carrying raw materials used to make the deadly nerve gas sarin.

Opposition parliamentarians: IOC is no place for a prince
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Dutch IOC member denying taking money from Salt
Lake City; Pickup 5th graf previous: ``Rosenmoeller was...'' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The scandal-hit International
Olympic Committee is no place for Prince Willem-Alexander, heir to
the throne, Dutch opposition parliamentarians said Monday.
	   ``Recent reports prove again that the IOC is mixed up with
dubious practices,'' Paul Rosenmoeller, leader of the Green Left
party told the daily NRC Handelsblad newspaper. ``That is not the
ideal company for our future king.''
	   The IOC was plunged into crisis earlier this month when a senior
member publicly said the process of voting for future Olympic hosts
was marked by corruption and vote-buying. Switzerland's Marc Hodler
estimated that 5 to 7 percent of the 115 members are open to
bribery.
	   The IOC has launched an investigation into Salt Lake City's
successful bid to host the 2002 Winter Games. Salt Lake organizers
admit having a dlrs 400,000 scholarship fund for IOC members'
families but have said this was a humanitarian gesture rather than
bribery.
	   Dutch IOC member Anton Geesink on Monday denied a report in
German magazine Der Spiegel that he was one of five members
implicated in the investigation. Der Spiegel did not elaborate.
	   ``I took no money from Salt Lake City or anybody else,'' the
64-year-old said in a statement cited by Dutch television news. ``I
also never sent any children to study in America at their expense.
They must have me confused with somebody else.''

Parliament accepts Turabi's resignation as speaker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Sudan's Parliament on Monday accepted the
resignation of its speaker as part of a political shuffle that is
expected to preserve his role as the most influential person in the
country.
	   The 400-seat Parliament has accepted the resignation of Hassan
Turabi, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported from the Sudanese
capital of Khartoum. It gave no other details. The report could not
be immediately confirmed.
	   The resignation must now be approved by President Omar
el-Bashir, but that is considered a formality.
	   Turabi had announced his resignation on Dec. 2 to work full time
for the governing National Congress party, whose monopoly on
politics will end next year under a law passed Dec. 9.
	   The Political Associations Law, which comes into effect Jan. 1,
allows for the formation of political groups that may contest
elections.
	   El-Bashir, who banned all political parties after seizing power
in a 1989 military coup, said recently that the door was open for
opposition figures in exile to come back and form political
associations.
	   But the presence of the hard-line Turabi at the head of
Parliament had cast doubts on the seriousness of the government's
willingness to allow the opposition to flourish. Political analysts
interpreted Turabi's resignation as a government attempt to ease
those fears.
	   However, there is still some apprehension because the new law
only speaks of ``political associations.'' Turabi was strongly
opposed to some Parliament members' demand for a clear-cut
reference to ``political parties.''

German Foreign Minister protests sentencing of Chinese dissidents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer,
who drew China's anger recently by meeting with exiled dissident
Wei Jingsheng, said China's sentencing of two dissidents Monday was
unacceptable and flouted an international treaty the country
recently signed.
	   ``The reaction of Chinese authorities is totally unacceptable,''
Fischer said, calling for the dissidents' immediate release.
	   ``The accused simply tried through peaceful means to exercise
their right to free speech and assembly, which are guaranteed by
China's constitution,'' and by the United Nations' International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which China recently signed,
Fischer said in a statement.
	   Chinese courts sentenced dissidents Xu Wenli and Wang Youcai to
13 and 11 years for trying to organize an opposition political
party.

Iraq: Bombing destroyed main short-range missile factories
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Iraqi reports that attacks e
destroyed short-range missile factories; comments by Tony Blair's
office; CHANGES overline, byline &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.S. and British airstrikes demolished
Iraq's two main factories for producing parts for short-range
missiles that are permitted by the United Nations, officials said
Monday.
	   The attacks on the factories, which are near Baghdad, appear to
be part of a strategy to destroy installations that could be used
to produce weapons of mass destruction or long-range missiles.
	   Besides the missile facilities, nearly all of Iraq's military
factories were attacked and many sustained heavy damage, Iraqi
officials said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Authorities, however, have not allowed foreign reporters to
visit any of the sites attacked during the four-night assault that
ended Saturday.
	   No final casualty toll has been released, but previous reports
indicated that at least 42 Iraqis were killed and 96 wounded in the
strikes. Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations said thousands of
people have been killed or injured, but did not substantiate that
claim.
	   Iraq called the confrontation a victory for its people,
	   In his first public comments since the attacks ended late
Saturday, President Saddam Hussein said in a speech on Sunday that
Iraq defeated ``enemies of God.''
	   In the televised address, Saddam his people: ``God will repay
well and crown your heart with clear victory.''
	   Iraq has also vowed to end all dealings with U.N. weapons
inspectors who are responsible for dismantling Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction _ chemical, biological or nuclear weapons and
missiles with ranges in excess of 150 kilometers (90 miles).
	   U.N. weapons monitors also routinely inspect Iraqi short-range
missiles to ensure that they have not been tampered with to
increase their ranges beyond 150 kilometers (90 miles).
	   Iraqi officials said that among the sites attacked were the
al-Nasser factory in Taji, 60 kilometers (40 miles) north of
Baghdad and the al-Nida factory, south of the capital, Iraqi
officials said.
	   The al-Nasser factory produces parts for the Ababeel, or ``fire
bird,'' missiles, which has a range of 50 kilometers (30 miles).
	   The al-Nida factory produces components for the al-Samoud or
``steadfastness'' missile which has a slightly longer range.
	   The officials said the attacks have virtually halted Iraqi
efforts to produce short-range missiles.
	   Al-Nasser was heavily bombed during the 1991 Gulf War but
workers had dismantled most of its high-tech lathes and removed
them before the attacks.
	   Iraqi officials said that the speed of the attacks this time
took them by surprise and workers did not have enough time to
remove crucial equipment from either factory.
	   The United States and Britain mounted their airstrikes less than
24 hours after chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler
submitted a report accusing Baghdad of failing to fully cooperate
with his weapons inspectors.
	   The arms monitors had 12 remote-control monitoring cameras at
al-Nasser to ensure that the lathes were not used to produce parts
for long-range missiles.
	   The United States fired two dozen Tomahawk missiles at al-Nida
in January 1993 after Iraq blocked weapons inspections.
	   The al-Nida factory reportedly has the most sophisticated metal
working equipment in the country.
	   The 1993 attack had leveled scores of buildings but all of the
important machinery had reportedly been removed days before the
strike. The Iraqis swiftly rebuilt the collapsed buildings and the
factory was fully operational within five months.
	   The recent strikes have also disrupted the distribution of
supplies under the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program, Hans von
Sponeck, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Iraq said Monday.
	   ``Our program has been severely curtailed,'' he told Associated
Press Television News.
	   The program allows Iraq to get around U.N. economic sanctions by
selling limited quantities of oil to buy food and other
humanitarian goods.
	   Meanwhile, extremist Islamic groups have threatened retaliation
for the airstrikes.
	   Al-Gamaa al-Islamiya, or the Islamic Group, called for a ``holy
war'' against the United States and a boycott of American and
British products.
	   The group made the call in a statement sent to the Cairo office
of the Al-Hayat newspaper.
	   In London, the office of British Prime Minister Tony Blair said
the airstrikes targeted 100 sites and left the Iraqi air defense
system ``in ruins.''
	   ``We believe the damage that has been inflicted in the last few
days has left Saddam very weak and vulnerable,'' Blair's spokesman
said. He spoke on customary condition of anonymity.

Airstrikes left Iraqi air defense in ruins, Britain says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 10 grafs with Blair interview, picks up graf 6,
``Foreign Secretary''; ``that is in ruins'' cq in graf 5 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ U.S.-British airstrikes left Iraq ``significantly
weaker'' and wrecked parts of its military structure, Prime
Minister Tony Blair said Monday.
	   ``The full battle damage will await a later time, but I think it
is beyond any doubt at all that we have set back certainly part of
his military infrastructure several years,'' Blair said in an
interview broadcast by Cable News Network.
	   Earlier, Blair's office said the military action targeted 100
sites and left the Iraqi air defense system ``in ruins.''
	   Britain, the United States and its allies will look at the
possibility of resuming weapons inspections in Iraq, but ``there is
no point in having such a regime unless it works,'' Blair said.
	   Ultimately, force might be required again to contain President
Saddam Hussein's ambitions, he said.
	   ``Saddam is significantly weaker. There are parts of his
military infrastructure that is in ruins. It is true that we could
do even more if we were committing an even greater amount of force,
or ground troops, but I think that people aren't prepared to do
that in this situation,'' Blair said.
	   ``What happens now is perfectly simple,'' he added. ``One, we
contain him, if necessary by the threat of military force. Two, we
investigate whether it is possible to put a proper regime in. If it
is, we do that. If it isn't, and if Iraq is not going to cooperate
at all, then we have to rely on other methods of containment. And
thirdly, of course, we make sure that the regime of sanctions
enforcement is tightened.''
	   A spokesman for Blair, speaking on condition of anonymity, had
said targets during the four-day bombardment that ended Saturday
included 20 command and control facilities and nine sites linked to
the Republican Guard.
	   Attacks on 35 other targets ``have left the Iraqi air defense
system in ruins,'' said the spokesman.
	   Six of the targets were related to delivery systems, including
remote-controlled aircraft, for Iraq's weapons of mass destruction,
he said.
	   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said earlier that Britain's next
step would be to try to isolate Iraq in the world community and
reduce any support Saddam Hussein's regime has among Arab nations.
	   Cook said there also would be new attempts to get humanitarian
aid directly to the Iraqi people.
	   ``It's not going to be easy,'' he told BBC Radio, ``because
Saddam does everything possible to obstruct and prevent it, and it
is very difficult to operate in Iraq without Saddam's agreement
given the brutality and savagery with which he represses all
opposition.''
	   After a meeting later with German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer, Cook said the European Union would participate in the
humanitarian efforts.
	   Britain also wants to ensure that U.N. monitoring of Iraq's
weapons program is maintained and that sanctions are better
enforced.
	   Britain and the United States had said Iraq's refusal to
cooperate fully with the inspectors led them to attack. Iraq says
it will no longer tolerate the weapons inspections.
	   Cook said the military strikes had destroyed Saddam's ability to
jam radio programs being broadcast into Iraq from opposition groups
and news programs.
	   ``We can try now to get the truth into the Iraqi people,'' he
said.
	   The foreign secretary said he would spend Monday speaking by
telephone with European and Arab leaders to try to build support
for non-military action against Iraq.
	   ``We will be seeking to build the broadest possible consensus
against Saddam and make sure he is as isolated as possible,'' he
said.
	   Eight Arab states _ including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria _
warned Baghdad last month that it would be ``held responsible for
any consequences'' of not cooperating with U.N. officials.
	   But no Arab government expressed support for the airstrikes _
which were condemned by the world's largest Muslim group, the
52-nation Organization of the Islamic Conference based in Saudi
Arabia.
	   The United States said Sunday that the airstrikes had achieved
their specific military objectives, and that U.S. policy was
shifting toward toppling Saddam.

After 13 seasons, star striker threatens to leave
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHAMPTON, England (AP) _ After years of pledging his loyalty,
England striker Matt Le Tissier has threatened to leave Southampton
if the south coast team gets relegated from the Premier League.
	   With his team next to last in the standings, the 30-year-old
striker, who has been at the The Dell since he started his career
13 years ago, said it would be very difficult for him to accept
life in division one.
	   ``I would put money on us staying up but then I have always
liked a long shot,'' Le Tissier said on Monday.
	   ``I want to play in the Premier League for the whole of my
career. That's the one thing I have always wanted to do.
	   ``I think I'm good enough to play in the Premier League for the
rest of my playing days and, of course, that's the place to be. It
would be very difficult for me to play in the First Division.''
	   Le Tissier and Saints have fought off huge bids by clubs like
Manchester United and Arsenal to lure away the talented striker,
who has played eight times for England.
	   But he feels he may have to move if the club is relegated.
	   ``That is no disrespect to the players down there but I'd like
to think I've got enough to offer in the Premier League to stay
there,'' he said.
	   ``Obviously I don't know how I'll feel in the summer. Then when
the situation arises I'll have to take all my feelings into
consideration.''

Lesotho critic charges special court built for mutiny trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ An opposition leader on Monday charged
that a new courtroom being built within the central prison was
designed to keep the public away from a mutiny trial.
	   Vincent Malebo said that a group of soldiers suspected of
overthrowing the military leadership in September were to stand
trial in the specially constructed security area.
	   Lesotho government officials could not be reached for comment.
	   Malebo made his comments at a news conference about progress of
a special commission, the Interim Political Authority, that is to
prepare new elections within 18 months. Malebo is a member of the
group.
	   The commission was set up by the government and opposition after
3,500 South African and Botswanan soldiers entered Lesotho in
September to quell an army mutiny and unrest linked to elections
last May.
	   The arrival of the troops triggered widespread rioting and
firebombing in the capital of Maseru, in which scores of South
Africans and Lesotho citizens died.
	   Lesotho's governing party won by a landslide in the May
election, but opposition parties claimed the vote was rigged.
	   A commission official, Khauhelo Raditapole, said the group would
give high priority to the question of the continued detention of
soldiers suspected of participating in the mutiny.
	   When the soldiers were arrested in October, opposition leaders
charged the government had betrayed a promise made to soldiers that
nothing would happen to them if they returned to their bases.

Maier leads Austrian sweep
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with detail, quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PATSCHERKOFEL, Austria (AP) _ Hermann Maier led an Austrian
parade down the legendary Patscherkofel Olympic course and up the
scoreboard.
	   The ``Herminator'' won Monday's super-giant slalom and was
followed immediately by eight of his countrymen, the first time a
country has swept the top nine places in an Alpine World Cup event.
	   Racing on the same course where Franz Klammer captured the 1976
Olympic title, Maier and his teammates thrilled a huge home crowd,
including many children who were given the day off to watch their
heroes.
	   ``It was a sensational race for me and for the team. We need
more races like this ... I skied (far) away from the ideal line and
I struggled to win on this track, as Klammer did to achieve his
Olympic victory,'' Maier said.
	   With Klammer in the finish area to congratulate his countrymen,
Maier finished the 1,947-meter course in 1 minute, 23.52 seconds.
	   Christian Mayer was .76 of a second behind and Fritz Strobl
another hundredth back to place second and third and fill the
podium with Austrians in the third super giant slalom race of the
season.
	   Stephan Eberharter was fourth followed by Rainer Salzgeber and
Hans Knauss.
	   After the race finally got underway 65 minutes late due to fog,
Patrick Wirth, Andreas Schifferer and Werner Franz finished
seventh, eighth and ninth to make the race look like the Austrian
national championships before Norway's Lasse Paulsen ended the
domination by finishing in 10th, 1.01 seconds behind.
	   Previously, the best team showing dated back to 1968, when the
French women swept the top six places in a downhill race at
Abetone, Italy.
	   Austrians gave an indication of their dominance last month by
taking the top five places in a super-giant slalom at Aspen,
Colorado.
	   Maier's third victory of the season _ and 13th of his World Cup
career _ vaulted the defending World Cup champion back to the top
of the overall standings.
	   With 540 points from 12 races, Maier moved past Norway's Lasse
Kjus by three points. Kjus slipped to second place with a
14th-place finish in Monday's race.
	   Mayer moved into third with 462 points, ahead of Eberharter.
	   Maier also piled up a commanding lead of 280 points, 50 more
than Eberharter, in the super-giant slalom standings.
	   The Austrian superstar, who finished fourth in the two previous
races in Val Gardena and Alta Badia, had to recover from a near
crash at midcourse when his hand touched the snow while clearing a
gate.
	   ``The course was perfect, and the fans gave me a big boost,''
Maier said. ``I just wanted to win here. This race was very special
to me.''
	   Strobl, who reaced the podium despite starting 45th, said the
team success ``took a lot of pressure off of us.''
	   ``Third place also gives me a lot of morale for coming races. We
certainly have the best Super-G team.''
	   The men's World Cup circuit will break until reconvening Dec. 29
in Bormio, Italy.
	   The Austrians, who already have six victories in slalom, giant
slalom and super-g, will try for the fourth time to win their first
downhill of the season.

Netanyahu said ready to dissolve government, go to early elections

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu, Barak quotes &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A storm of opposition from both foes and
friends of the new peace accord brought Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's government to the brink of collapse Monday.
	   Netanyahu, backed into a political corner, was expected to agree
to dissolve his government and call early elections to seek a
public mandate for his policies.
	   Israel's divided Knesset, or parliament, convened Monday evening
for what was expected to be lengthy debate on the faltering Wye
River land-for-security peace accord and prime minister's hardline
stance toward the Palestinians.
	   Early on, Netanyahu briefly addressed lawmakers and was heckled
by a right-wing lawmaker when he referred to terms for an Israeli
pullback from the West Bank.
	   Netanyahu said that if the Knesset failed to back his withdrawal
terms, he would back an early elections bill also scheduled for a
vote on Monday.
	   ``Most of the country supports our policies,'' Netanyahu said.
``If the Knesset doesn't support them, we will turn to the people
and ask them to support it.''
	   He indicated he would consult with the opposition on an
appropriate date for elections in that case.
	   Netanyahu's speech sounded like a campaign opener: ``The way to
reach true peace is to maintain demands that Palestinians carry out
their obligations, that way we will protect peace, security and
Jerusalem.''
	   Ehud Barak, the leader of the opposition Labor party, outlined a
platform addressing Israel's sagging economy.
	   ``This government divided Israel and gave into the extremists _
at the expense of education, of employment, of true security for
all,'' he said.
	   The head of each parliamentary faction was to speak for five
minutes, and then Netanyahu's peace polices would go to a vote.

Decapitated heads of hostages to be returned in Moscow

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with director of gas company kidnapped in 8th graf,
heads of foreigners to be delivered later this week in 2nd graf,
denial that ransom demanded for bodies in 4th graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechen officials plan to travel to Moscow to turn
over the severed heads of four Westerners found earlier this month
in the breakaway Russian republic, Chechnya's presidential
spokesman said Monday.
	   The Chechens were expected in Moscow later this week and will
give the remains to the British and New Zealand embassies, said
Chechen presidential spokesman Mairbek Vachagayev, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The victims _ Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi
of Britain and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were abducted Oct. 3 in
Chechnya, where they were installing a cellular phone system.
	   Their heads were found by a roadside Dec. 8. Authorities still
have not found their bodies. British and Chechen officials denied
Monday that the kidnappers were demanding a ransom for the bodies.
	   ``I've had some indirect contact which suggests that the remains
will be transported out (of Chechnya) tomorrow, but have not had
direct contact confirming the report,'' New Zealand Ambassador John
Larkindale told The Associated Press.
	   ``I certainly hope the report is true. We want to repatriate the
remains as soon as possible,'' he said.
	   The killers remain at large. Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov
has accused a regional warlord linked to past kidnappings with the
beheadings.
	   Meanwhile, the head of the Chechengazprom gas company was
kidnapped while traveling through Grozny in a company car,
ITAR-Tass cited Chechen officials as saying Monday. Gas company
employees rallied Monday night to demand that officials crack down
on the kidnappers.
	   Chechnya has been plagued by violence and kidnappings for ransom
for years, especially since its 1994-1996 independence war against
Russia. More than 100 people are thought to be in captivity there.
	   Maskhadov, unable to control the rising crime wave, recently
imposed a state of emergency and promised to crack down on armed
bandits in the region.

 &UR; Tensions rise as Serbian police retaliate against ethnic Albanians
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with KLA statement, Ogata touring Kosovo
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police swept down on a
Kosovo Albanian stronghold Monday in retaliation for the killing of
one of their officers, despite NATO threats to intervene in the
troubled province.
	   The death of the Serbian policeman in Podujevo, 40 kilometers
(25 miles) north of Pristina, and the Serb response, ratchets up
the chances of a return to all-out war in the troubled Serbian
province.
	   NATO's top commander in Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark, held brief
talks Monday in Belgrade with the Serb-led Yugoslav army chiefs,
the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade said.
	   Clark's visit comes amid escalating violence in Kosovo where
majority ethnic Albanians have been fighting for secession.
	   Sources close to the talks said that Clark repeated earlier NATO
warnings that the alliance might intervene if the fighting between
Serbian security forces and ethnic Albanian rebels didn't stop.
	   The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic signed a U.S.-sponsored
deal last October, promising an end to the Kosovo military campaign
and agreeing permit deployment of up to 2,000 international
verifiers to monitor the truce.
	   The government-run Media Center reported a 52-year-old
policeman, Milic Jovic, was mortally wounded by unknown assailants
in Podujevo early Monday. A woman accompanying Jovic was wounded in
the leg, the center said.
	   Podujevo is an overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian town near central
Serbia. Tensions there have risen in past weeks, as local Serbs
complained of a growing guerrilla presence and demanded the
government protect them.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources in Podujevo, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said a police sweep followed the morning shooting. The
Kosovo Information Center, close to the Albanian leadership, said
the town was sealed off while Serb police brought in
reinforcements. Sporadic shooting could be heard from an area
northeast of the town, the center said.
	   Hysen Fazliu, a spokesman for the main ethnic Albanian party in
Podujevo, said that the Serbian forces clashed with rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army and that an unspecified number of ethnic Albanians
have been arrested.
	   The KLA spokesman in the Podujevo region, Luizim Oraca, claimed
that the clash lasted two hours and that the ``enemy was forced to
withdraw, and one of their tanks was destroyed.'' The report could
not be independently confirmed.
	   Jovic's killing is the latest in a series of setbacks for
Kosovo's fragile de-facto truce. It is certain to enrage the Serbs,
already furious over last week's killings of six Serb youths in a
Kosovo bar and a prominent Serb official.
	   The Monday incident came a day after the KLA buried 33 fighters
killed last week in a border clash with the Yugoslav army.
	   The attack on Jovic also heightens fears that violence in Kosovo
is moving from the rugged countryside to the towns.
	   Several hundred Serbs staged a rally Monday in Kosovo Polje, a
few kilometers (miles) west of Pristina, demanding protection
against what they say is increasing danger from the ethnic
Albanians.
	   The angry crowd booed and jeered as Serbia's interior minister,
Vlajko Stojiljkovic, declared ``terrorism has been defeated'' and
``only gangs of criminals are left out in the field.''
	   Stojiljkovic also vowed ``a resolute fight for the final
destruction of the terrorists and the protection of (Serbia's)
sovereignty and territorial integrity.''
	   The previous Serb crackdown against Kosovo Albanian separatists
launched last February claimed over 1,000 lives and forced some
300,000 people from their homes. The campaign also brought threats
of NATO airstrikes until Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
reached an agreement to defuse the crisis.
	   But attempts to follow that up with a detailed plan for the
province's long-term future have failed so far because the two
sides are so far apart. Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of
the population, want independence while Serbia refuses to give up
control over its southern province.
	   Serbia is the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   In neighboring Albania, the government called Monday on all
Kosovo Albanian factions to unite and offered to host talks between
the KLA and followers of moderate ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova. There was no immediate response from the two camps.
	   Albania's interior ministry also said Serb border guards opened
fire early Saturday on Albanian troops along the tense border.
International observers reported similar incidents.
	   Kosovo Albanian rebels operate from sanctuaries in Albania.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, toured
Kosovo Monday together with the U.S. head of the verification
mission, William Walker.

Bietry quits PSG after turbulent year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Charles Bietry, the controversial president of
struggling soccer giant Paris Saint-Germain, resigned on Monday,
the club announced.
	   Reeling from a string of disastrous results, PSG, France's
richest club, lies in 11th place in the French standings, 22 points
behind leader and archrival Marseille.
	   The club has been in crisis since Bietry, a former sports
journalist, took over in pre-season.
	   After a string of poor results, including a defeat by tiny
Maccabi Haifa in the European Cup Winners Cup, coach Alain Giresse
was fired.
	   But results have not improved since Bietry re-appointed Artur
Jorge as PSG coach. In its final match of 1998 last Saturday, PSG
was beaten 2-0 by minnow Lorient.
	   Before moving to PSG, Bietry had been sports director at pay
television broadcaster Canal Plus, which owns the club.
	   Bizarrely, one of Bietry's last major decision's at PSG was to
re-appoint Jorge. As a sports commentator, Bietry had been one of
Jorge's biggest critics when the Portuguese coach was last in
charge at PSG.
	   Bietry, who often sits alongside players on the bench during
matches, has been accused by former players and officials of
interfering in team matters.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer,
who drew China's anger recently by meeting with exiled dissident
Wei Jingsheng, said China's sentencing of two dissidents Monday was
unacceptable and flouted an international treaty the country
recently signed.
	   ``The reaction of Chinese courts is totally unacceptable,''
Fischer said, calling for the dissidents' immediate release.
	   ``The accused simply tried through peaceful means to exercise
their right to free speech and assembly, which are guaranteed by
China's constitution,'' and by the United Nations' International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which China recently signed,
Fischer said in a statement.
	   Chinese courts sentenced dissidents Xu Wenli and Wang Youcai to
13 and 11 years for trying to organize an opposition political
party.

Iraq: bombing destroyed main short-range missile factories
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Iraqi reports that attacks destroyed
short-range missile factories, Aziz statement that 62 soldiers
killed; comments by Tony Blair's office; CHANGES overline, byline &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.S. and British airstrikes demolished
Iraq's two main factories for producing parts for short-range
missiles and killed 62 soldiers, Iraqi officials said Monday.
	   The attacks on the factories, which are near Baghdad, appear to
be part of a strategy to destroy installations that could be used
to produce weapons of mass destruction or long-range missiles. The
factories were permitted under United Nations sanctions.
	   Besides the missile facilities, nearly all of Iraq's military
factories were attacked and many sustained heavy damage, Iraqi
officials said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Authorities, however, have not allowed foreign reporters to
visit any of the sites attacked during the four-night assault that
ended Saturday.
	   Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, said on Monday that 62
soldiers were killed and 180 wounded in the four nights of
U.S.-British air strikes. Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations
has said thousands of people, mostly civilians, have been killed or
injured, but did not substantiate that claim.
	   Iraq called the confrontation a victory for its people.
	   In his first public comments since the attacks ended late
Saturday, President Saddam Hussein said in a speech on Sunday that
Iraq defeated ``enemies of God.''
	   In the televised address, Saddam his people: ``God will repay
well and crown your heart with clear victory.''
	   Iraq has also vowed to end all dealings with U.N. weapons
inspectors who are responsible for dismantling Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction _ chemical, biological or nuclear weapons and
missiles with ranges in excess of 150 kilometers (90 miles).
	   U.N. weapons monitors also routinely inspect Iraqi short-range
missiles to ensure that they have not been tampered with to
increase their range beyond 150 kilometers (90 miles).
	   Iraqi officials said that among the sites attacked were the
al-Nasser factory in Taji, 60 kilometers (40 miles) north of
Baghdad and the al-Nida factory, south of the capital, Iraqi
officials said.
	   The al-Nasser factory produces parts for the Ababeel, or ``fire
bird,'' missiles, which has a range of 50 kilometers (30 miles).
	   The al-Nida factory produces components for the al-Samoud or
``steadfastness'' missile which has a slightly longer range.
	   The officials said the attacks have virtually halted Iraqi
efforts to produce short-range missiles.
	   Al-Nasser was heavily bombed during the 1991 Gulf War but
workers had dismantled most of its high-tech lathes and removed
them before the attacks.
	   Iraqi officials said that the speed of the attacks this time
took them by surprise and workers did not have enough time to
remove crucial equipment from either factory.
	   The United States and Britain mounted their airstrikes less than
24 hours after chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler
submitted a report accusing Baghdad of failing to fully cooperate
with his weapons inspectors.
	   The arms monitors had 12 remote-control monitoring cameras at
al-Nasser to ensure that the lathes were not used to produce parts
for long-range missiles.
	   The United States fired two dozen Tomahawk missiles at al-Nida
in January 1993 after Iraq blocked weapons inspections.
	   The al-Nida factory reportedly has the most sophisticated metal
working equipment in the country.
	   The 1993 attack had leveled scores of buildings but all of the
important machinery had reportedly been removed days before the
strike. The Iraqis swiftly rebuilt the collapsed buildings and the
factory was fully operational within five months.
	   The recent strikes have also disrupted the distribution of
supplies under the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program, Hans von
Sponeck, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Iraq said Monday.
	   ``Our program has been severely curtailed,'' he told Associated
Press Television News.
	   The program allows Iraq to get around U.N. economic sanctions by
selling limited quantities of oil to buy food and other
humanitarian goods.
	   Meanwhile, extremist Islamic groups have threatened retaliation
for the airstrikes.
	   Al-Gamaa al-Islamiya, or the Islamic Group, called for a ``holy
war'' against the United States and a boycott of American and
British products.
	   The group made the call in a statement sent to the Cairo office
of the Al-Hayat newspaper.
	   In London, the office of British Prime Minister Tony Blair said
the airstrikes targeted 100 sites and left the Iraqi air defense
system ``in ruins.''
	   ``We believe the damage that has been inflicted in the last few
days has left Saddam very weak and vulnerable,'' Blair's spokesman
said. He spoke on customary condition of anonymity.

Man reports seeing wallaby on Reindoor Road _ really
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAMWORTH, England (AP) _ Kevin Fisher swore he hadn't been
drinking when he called police to say he had spotted a wallaby
under a lamppost in this central England city _ on Reindeer Road,
no less.
	   ``Mr. Fisher couldn't believe his eyes and sounded quite shaken.
He swore blind he was still sober,'' a Staffordshire Police
spokesman who was not identified told Press Association, the
British news agency.
	   ``Luckily, we took him seriously,'' the spokesman said. ``Though
at first we were tempted to tell him to hop it.''
	   Willy the wallaby, a member of the kangaroo family, had escaped
from a nearby animal park, but was captured after Fisher called
police Saturday night.
	   The park said it had not yet located Willy's secret escape
route.

	   Aziz said what the airstrikes, which ended Saturday, destroyed
barracks of the Republican and Special Republican Guards. But
barracks and buildings can easily be rebuilt, he said.
	   However, ``the serious damage was in civilian sites ... the
American way of war. They attacked almost all industrial sites,''
he said.
	   The civilian sites included government buildings, party
buildings, radio and television facilities, communications,
hospitals, private homes, schools.
	   ``This is a policy of hatred, an imperialist colonial policy.
This is not a policy based on international law,'' Aziz said,
adding that the United States and Britain are ``criminals''
	   ``This is a criminal aggression,'' he said

 &UR; Report: Puerto Rican dairy company fires drivers amid diluting
charges &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ One of Puerto Rico's largest dairy
companies has fired 10 truck drivers who are facing federal charges
of diluting milk with water and salt.
	   Tres Monjitas Inc. fired six drivers on Friday and four others
while federal prosecutors were investigating the charges, general
manager Juan Corrada del Rio said in Monday's Primera Hora
newspaper.
	   On Friday, U.S. prosecutors indicted 20 dairy farmers, 12 truck
drivers and seven administrators on charges they diluted milk
shipments en route from farms to processing plants.
	   The farmers allegedly paid drivers to thin the shipments with
water and add salt so that they would pass tests based on milk's
lower freezing point.
	   Prosecutors claimed to have videotapes of workers diluting the
milk. They said the mixture was harmless to consumers, and most of
the shipments were stopped by U.S. agriculture inspectors.
	   Tres Monjitas and its main competitor, Suiza Dairy, asked U.S.
officials to investigate after detecting the diluted milk earlier
this year.

	   Aziz said the aggressors should be called to account for their
actions, and after that U.N. economic sanctions should be lifted.
The sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   ``Iraq cannot tolerate the embargo and UNSCOM,'' Aziz said,
referring to the United Nations Special Commission, which is
responsible for dismantling the country's weapons of mass
destruction.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair have demanded that Iraq allow UNSCOM to resume work before
any talk of lifting the sanctions can be considered.
	   Asked to react to that, Aziz said: ``We shall never, never
accept any condition made by Clinton or Blair.''
	   ``We did not damage our relations with the United Nations. They
damaged the United Nations itself,'' he said.
	   ``They acted according to the law of the jungle ... so it is
their responsibility to rebuild their relations with the
international community,'' he said.

Warne, Waugh bookie scandal overshadows achievements on field
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Mark Taylor's Aussie record-tying 334 and his
refusal to chase Brian Lara's world record amazed cricket fans in
1998.
	   Muttiah Muralitharan's match-winning nine for 59 and 16 total
wickets for Sri Lanka against England was the bowling performance
of the year.
	   But the biggest headlines were for Shane Warne's 5,000 and Mark
Waugh's 6,000. Not runs or wickets, but the Australian dollars they
received from an Indian bookmaker in one of the biggest scandals to
hit cricket in the long history of the sport.
	   The gentlemanly game of cricket was dragged through the mud in
the final month of an eventful year when Australian stars Warne and
Waugh admitted that they accepted cash from an illegal bookmaker.
The cash was for giving him inside information on weather and
playing conditions during matches in Pakistan in 1994.
	   They were each fined in '95 by the Australian Cricket Board but
the fact that the scandal was kept secret, even by the sport's
world governing body, the International Cricket Council, added to
the shame, which was eventually exposed by an Australian newspaper.
	   It also overshadowed some great performances, especially by
Taylor and Muralitharan.
	   The 34-year-old Australian captain was dismissed by the media
and many of the Australian fans 18 months ago. But he kept his job
and became a hero when he tied Don Bradman's highest ever score by
an Australian, 334, playing against Pakistan at Peshawar in
October.
	   The dogged left-hander was not out overnight and, instead of
chasing the 42 runs to beat Lara's world record 375, he declared.
Taylor said that matching the legendary Bradman was achievement
enough.
	   But he still led Australia to a 1-0 series victory over Pakistan
and ended the year making sure Australia held on to the Ashes for a
record-tying sixth consecutive time.
	   A thunderstorm denied Australia a first-test victory over
England at Brisbane but Taylor's team outplayed Alec Stewart's men
at Perth and Adelaide to open up a 2-0 lead with two matches to go.
	   Muralitharan chose the one-off test against England at the Oval
to produce the fifth best bowling performance in the history of
cricket.
	   The off-spinner, who was once accused by an umpire of having an
illegal throwing action but was cleared by the ICC, took seven
wickets for 155 runs in England's first innings of 445 and then
single-handedly destroyed the home team in the second.
	   He came up with nine for 59 as England was bowled out for 181,
giving Sri Lanka an unexpected victory by 37 runs. The only other
wicket to fall in the second innings was the run out of England
captain Stewart.
	   Although Australia remained cricket's strongest team, it
suffered a 2-1 series loss in India, where the home team won the
first two matches by 179 runs and an innings within four days.
	   The West Indies made their first ever visit to South Africa and
only got there after four days of negotiations at London's Heathrow
airport after threatening to strike in a row over match fees.
	   Sadly for captain Brian Lara, one of the players at the center
of the row with the West Indian federation, his team lost the first
two of the five tests.
	   South Africa had a mixed season, squandering a 1-0 lead to lose
the series against England 2-1. But it created some cricket history
by winning the first Commonwealth Games tournament, beating the
favored Australians in the final of the one-day competition in
Kuala Lumpur.
	   Zimbabwe gained a first test victory in Pakistan, and, with fog
and fading light ruining play in the second test, was guaranteed at
least a share of the three-match series.
	   In domestic competitions, Leicestershire won the English county
championship for the third time after Surrey's big lead evaporated
in the last few weeks while Western Australia beat Tasmania by
seven wickets in the Sheffield Shield final after two successive
failures in previous finals.

Netanyahu said ready to dissolve government, go to early elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu, Barak quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A storm of opposition from both foes and
friends of the new peace accord brought Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's government to the brink of collapse Monday.
	   Netanyahu, backed into a political corner, was expected to agree
to dissolve his government and call early elections to seek a
public mandate for his policies.
	   Israel's divided Knesset, or parliament, convened Monday evening
for what was expected to be lengthy debate on the faltering Wye
River land-for-security peace accord and prime minister's hard-line
stance toward the Palestinians.
	   Early on, Netanyahu briefly addressed lawmakers and was heckled
by a right-wing lawmaker when he referred to terms for an Israeli
pullback from the West Bank.
	   Netanyahu said that if the Knesset failed to support his
withdrawal terms, he would back an early elections bill also
scheduled for a vote on Monday.
	   ``Most of the country supports our policies,'' Netanyahu said.
``If the Knesset doesn't support them, we will turn to the people
and ask them to support it.''
	   He indicated he would consult with the opposition on an
appropriate date for elections in that case.
	   Netanyahu's speech sounded like a campaign opener: ``The way to
reach true peace is to maintain demands that Palestinians carry out
their obligations, that way we will protect peace, security and
Jerusalem.''
	   Ehud Barak, the leader of the opposition Labor party, outlined a
platform addressing Israel's sagging economy.
	   ``This government divided Israel and gave into the extremists _
at the expense of education, of employment, of true security for
all,'' he said.
	   The head of each parliamentary faction was to speak for five
minutes, and then Netanyahu's peace polices would go to a vote.

	   Aziz said the aggressors should be called to account for their
actions, and U.N. economic sanctions should be lifted. The
sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   ``Iraq cannot tolerate the embargo and UNSCOM,'' Aziz said,
referring to the United Nations Special Commission, which is
responsible for dismantling the country's weapons of mass
destruction.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair have demanded that Iraq allow UNSCOM to resume work before
any talk of lifting the sanctions can be considered.
	   Asked to react to that, Aziz said: ``We shall never, never
accept any condition made by Clinton or Blair.''
	   ``We did not damage our relations with the United Nations. They
damaged the United Nations itself,'' he said.
	   ``They acted according to the law of the jungle ... so it is
their responsibility to rebuild their relations with the
international community,'' he said.

Wages, output, trade all plummet in 1998, Russian govt. says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE thruout with ex-minister Nemtsov saying
budget unrealistic, predicting huge inflation, other details.
Trims. Adds byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's draft 1999 budget is unrealistic and the
government will print billions of rubles (dollars) to pay its
bills, sending inflation soaring and further impoverishing ordinary
Russians, a former government minister said Monday.
	   ``On paper, they have written a decent budget. ... It's all
looking very pretty. But the question is: Can this budget be
fulfilled or is it all lies?'' former Deputy Prime Minister Boris
Nemtsov said.
	   ``This budget cannot be implemented.''
	   Next year's budget is receiving particular attention as Russia
tries to pull itself out of its worst economic crisis since the
1991 Soviet collapse, which has shown little sign of abating.
	   The draft budget calls for revenues of 475 billion rubles (dlrs
22 billion) _ or nearly 40 billion rubles (dlrs 1.8 billion) a
month. But the government's revenues recently have only been about
20 billion rubles (dlrs 900 million) a month, said Nemtsov, a
prominent liberal politician.
	   ``There is only one way out. The government has to turn on the
printing presses. ... Except that in that case, inflation will be
beyond all bounds,'' Nemtsov said.
	   Nemtsov predicted that monthly inflation will reach 30 percent
in 1999 _ instead of 30 percent for the whole year as the budget
forecasts. He also said the ruble rate will reach 50 to 100 to the
dollar, instead of the planned 21.5.
	   The ruble, which stood at around six to the dollar before the
crisis began, was trading at around 22 to the dollar Monday, and
its slide had no sign of ending.
	   In addition, he said, ``The population's real incomes will be
down to half or one-third of what they are now.''
	   An average of more than 35 million Russians, or 24 percent of
the population, lived below the official poverty line of 619 rubles
(dlrs 30) each month from January through November, the Interfax
news agency said Monday, citing the State Statistics Committee.
	   In October, the figure reached more than 44 million Russians, or
one in three, the government has said.
	   Nemtsov was deputy premier in Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko's
Cabinet, which devalued the ruble and defaulted on some debts in
August, prompting foreign lenders to freeze aid to Russia.
	   Nemtsov again defended his government's decision on Monday,
saying it was forced by deep economic trouble and mismanagement by
the previous Cabinet. Many independent economists have agreed with
the assessment and said Kiriyenko's government should have been
allowed to continue with its economic program.
	   But President Boris Yeltsin sacked Kiriyenko's government a week
after the default and devaluation.
	   The draft budget, submitted to parliament earlier this month,
projects spending of 575 billion rubles (dlrs 26.7 billion), and a
deficit of 101 billion rubles (dlrs 4.7 billion).
	   The government already intends to print about 33 billion rubles
(dlrs 1.7 billion) next year to cover part of the deficit,
according to the draft budget.
	   The budget also relies on huge foreign loans that may not
materialize, and on restructuring nearly half of Russia's mammoth
foreign debts _ something that foreign creditors do not intend to
grant yet.
	   Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, was to debate the
draft budget next Thursday.
	   Also Monday, the government said industrial output fell 5
percent from January through November, most significantly in the
timber, machines, metals and chemicals sectors. Agricultural
production dropped 9 percent in that period.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilians Fernando Sherer,
Gustavo Borges, Carlos Jayme and Alexandre Massura broke the
short-couse world record for the 400-meter freestyle Monday,
shaving nearly 1.7 seconds off the old mark.
	   The quartet completed the distance in 3 minutes, 10.45 seconds
at a national meet in Rio.
	   Sherer and Borges also were members of the Brazilian team that
set the old record of 3:12.11 in 1993.

	   Aziz said Iraq strongly believes that the United States has only
suspended the attack and not ended it.
	   In fact, he said, the aggression never stopped since the 1991
Gulf War to evict Iraq out of Kuwait, and cited the economic
sanctions and the imposition of the no-fly zones in southern Iraq
as examples of aggression.
	   ``It has never stopped. It has taken different chapters,'' he
said.
	   He ridiculed Clinton for saying that the United States took
Islamic sensitivities into consideration while planning the attack
and ending it on the first day of the holy month of Ramadan when
Muslims are required to fast.
	   ``The question is not Ramadan. The question is that they had
assembled a limited amount of assets ... and they wanted to make a
swift and quick aggression,'' he said.
	   Asked to react to the attack on U.S. and British embassies in
Damascus by irate Syrians on Saturday, Aziz said it showed that
Arabs did not support the military strikes.
	   ``They know that the people in the world hate them because they
are criminals,'' he said.

 &UR; Tensions rise as Serbian police retaliate against ethnic Albanians
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with more details from Clark's visit,
clashes in Podujevo, more quotes from Serbian interior minister &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police swept down on a
Kosovo Albanian stronghold Monday in retaliation for the killing of
one of their officers, despite NATO threats to intervene in the
troubled province.
	   The death of a Serbian policeman in Podujevo, 40 kilometers (25
miles) north of Pristina, and the Serb response, ratchets up the
chances of a return to all-out war in the troubled province of
Kosovo.
	   NATO's top commander in Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark, held brief
talks Monday in Belgrade with the Serb-led Yugoslav army chiefs,
the U.S. embassy in Belgrade said.
	   Clark's visit comes amid escalating violence in Kosovo where
majority ethnic Albanians have been fighting for secession.
	   Sources close to the talks said that Clark repeated earlier NATO
warnings that the alliance might intervene if the fighting between
Serbian security forces and ethnic Albanian rebels didn't stop.
	   The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Kosovo, a province of Serbia, is part of the Yugoslav
federation, and is dominated by ethnic Albanians.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in October signed a
U.S.-sponsored deal promising a cease-fire and agreeing to deploy
up to 2,000 international verifiers to monitor the truce.
	   The government-run Media Center reported a 52-year-old
policeman, Milic Jovic, was mortally wounded by unknown assailants
in Podujevo early Monday. A woman who was accompanying Jovic was
wounded in the leg, the center said.
	   Podujevo is an overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian town near central
Serbia. Tensions there have risen in past weeks, as local Serbs
complained of a growing guerrilla presence and demanded the
government protect them.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources in Podujevo, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said a police sweep followed the morning shooting. The
Kosovo Information Center, close to the Albanian leadership, said
the town was sealed off while Serb police brought in
reinforcements. Sporadic shooting could be heard from an area
northeast of the town, the center said.
	   Hysen Fazliu, a spokesman for the main ethnic Albanian party in
Podujevo, said that the Serbian forces clashed with rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army fighters and that an unspecified number of ethnic
Albanians have been arrested.
	   Jovic's killing is the latest in a series of setbacks for
Kosovo's fragile truce. It is certain to enrage the Serbs, already
furious over last week's killings of six Serb youths in a Kosovo
bar and a prominent Serb official.
	   The incident came a day after the KLA buried 33 fighters killed
last week in a border clash with the Yugoslav army.
	   The attack on Jovic also heightens fears that violence in Kosovo
is moving from the rugged countryside to the towns.
	   Several hundred Serbs staged a rally Monday in Kosovo Polje, a
few kilometers (miles) west of Pristina, demanding protection
against what they said was increasing danger from the ethnic
Albanians.
	   The previous Serb crackdown against Kosovo Albanian separatists
launched last February claimed over 1,000 lives and forced some
300,000 people from their homes. The campaign also brought threats
of NATO airstrikes until Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
reached an agreement to defuse the crisis.
	   But attempts to follow that up with a detailed plan for the
province's long-term future have failed so far because the two
sides are so far apart. Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of
the population, want independence while Serbia refuses to give up
control over its southern province.
	   In neighboring Albania, the government called Monday on all
Kosovo Albanian factions to unite and offered to host talks between
the KLA and followers of moderate ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova. There was no immediate response from the two camps.
	   Albania's interior ministry also said Serb border guards opened
fire early Saturday on Albanian troops along the tense border.
International observers reported similar incidents.
	   Kosovo Albanian rebels operate from sanctuaries in Albania.

U.N. chief tells relatives of crash victims not to lose hope
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Britain-Lockerbie Anniversary &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
Monday he regretted that 10 years after the crash of Pan Am Flight
103 the truth hadn't yet come out but told families of the victims
not to lose hope.
	   ``I'm still hopeful that we will get a positive decision from
the Libyan government,'' he told reporters as he arrived at the
United Nations.
	   ``I had hoped it would come before this date, the anniversary,
but I have not lost hope and they (the relatives) should not,''
Annan said. ``It's regrettable that 10 years after the event we
have not been able to get to the truth so that they can put this
behind them, mourn their dead and carry on with their lives.''
	   Two Libyan suspects have been indicted in connection with the
bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland which killed 270 people. Last
week, Libya's parliament gave its conditional approval for their
trial in The Netherlands, but said some obstacles must still be
overcome before the men are handed over.
	   Earlier this month, Annan met with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi
to discuss a possible handover of the suspects. No agreement was
reached but Annan said Libya was expected to reach a decision soon.

	   Aziz said Iraq strongly believes that the United States has only
suspended the attack and not ended it.
	   The aggression has not stopped since the 1991 Gulf War to evict
Iraq out of Kuwait, Aziz said, citing the economic sanctions and
the imposition of the no-fly zones in southern Iraq as examples of
aggression.
	   ``It has never stopped. It has taken different chapters,'' he
said.
	   Aziz ridiculed Clinton for saying the United States took Islamic
sensitivities into consideration while planning the attack and
ending it on the first day of the holy month of Ramadan when
Muslims are required to fast.
	   ``The question is not Ramadan. The question is that they had
assembled a limited amount of assets ... and they wanted to make a
swift and quick aggression,'' he said.
	   Asked to react to the attack on U.S. and British embassies in
Damascus by irate Syrians on Saturday, Aziz said it showed that
Arabs did not support the military strikes.
	   ``They know that the people in the world hate them because they
are criminals,'' he said.

Samaranch bans trips by IOC members, sets special Jan. 23 meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ IOC members will no longer be allowed to visit
cities bidding for the Olympics as part of a new anti-corruption
drive ordered by president Juan Antonio Samaranch.
	   In another move, Samaranch has called an extraordinary executive
board meeting for next month to act on the Salt Lake City bribery
scandal and consider changes in the system for selecting Olympic
host cities.
	   ``I can tell you that the trips of IOC members to candidate
cities, these are terminated,'' Samaranch said in an interview in
Switzerland's Le Matin newspaper.
	   Samaranch didn't elaborate, but the visits by International
Olympic Committee members to bidding cities have long been
considered fraught with the dangers of corruption.
	   The members fly first-class, stay in the best hotels and are
wined and dined _ all in an attempt to win their vote.
	   In recent years, the IOC has attempted to tighten the rules by
restricting the visits to three days and putting a dlrs 150 limit
on the value of gifts offered to members.
	   The IOC visits have come under special scrutiny in light of the
misconduct allegations surrounding Salt Lake City's successful bid
for the 2002 Winter Olympics.
	   Salt Lake officials have admitted that six relatives of IOC
members were among those who benefited from nearly dlrs 400,000 in
scholarship aid from the bid committee.
	   There is growing evidence of other favors for IOC members,
including free medical care and gifts in excess of the dlrs 150
limit.
	   A ban on trips would presumably take effect immediately, meaning
IOC members won't be able to visit the cities bidding for the 2006
Winter Olympics _ Sion, Switzerland; Turin, Italy; Zakopane,
Poland; Klagenfurt, Austria; and Helsinki, Finland.
	   IOC vice president Dick Pound, who is leading an investigation
into the Salt Lake case, gave a guarded welcome to Samaranch's ban
on trips to bid cities.
	   ``As a response to the present crisis, it's probably a good
thing to do,'' he said in a telephone interview from Montreal.
``Whether it should be taken as the definitive, long-term response
or not, it's too early to say.''
	   In a sign that Samaranch wants the Salt Lake matter dealt with
quickly, he has called a special meeting of his executive board for
Jan. 23-24.
	   An executive board member, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the board was prepared to take immediate ``necessary
measures'' on the recommendations of Pound's inquiry.
	   Samaranch has said any IOC members found guilty of corruption
will be expelled or asked to resign.
	   The executive board will also use the January meeting to
consider ways of reforming the procedure for selecting host cities.
	   ``Definitely in the executive board, there is a feel for a need
for change,'' the board member said.
	   Proposals include the establishment of a small ``electoral
college'' of executive board members and representatives of
national Olympic committees, international federations and
athletes.
	   The group could either select the winner on its own, or choose
two finalist cities and then let the entire membership vote.
	   Changing the procedure would require a two-thirds majority of
the IOC assembly, which currently numbers 115.
	   Samaranch said it's like asking members ``to cut off their
heads.'' But he said under ``special circumstances'' the members
should agree to changes.
	   The reforms could be adopted in time for the vote in June on the
2006 Winter Games.
	   Pound urged caution, however, before overhauling the procedure.
He said the status quo offers a ``more statistically reliable''
system for choosing the right city.
	   ``If you narrow it down to an electoral college or the executive
board, you may not cover all the global factors,'' he said. ``The
real question is not the peccadilloes of a few minority of IOC
members. It's whether you get the overall picture of the Olympic
Games.
	   ``The standard of conduct is extremely serious but has to be put
in perspective.''

	   Aziz said a diplomatic solution to the Iraq problem can only
come by condemning the United States and Britain, by holding them
accountable and by lifting the sanctions completely.
	   ``Without that, it would be difficult for Iraq to talk,'' he
said.
	   Asked to comment on chief weapons inspector Richard Butler's
refusal to resign, Aziz said Butler ``is a cheap pawn in the hands
of the Americans.''

position during the whole period which prevented the Security
Council from taking any serious step toward lifting the
sanctions,'' he said.
	   Iraq has long accused the two countries of deliberately
preventing an end to the sanctions, which have helped reduced the
once-wealthy country to extreme poverty.
	   Aziz said Iraqi authorities will possibly let reporters see the
damage to the military facilities, which so far have been off
limits for journalists.
	   Iraq has so far concentrated on showing casualties to civilian
sites. Aziz also refused to give a civilian toll, saying the health
ministry will release a figure later.

Parents arrested in Lithuania for killing newborns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: note contents &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) - A Lithuanian couple has been arrested
on charges of murdering three of their newborn children, burning at
least two of them alive in their stove at home, the newspaper
Lietuvos Rytas reported Monday.
	   Danguole Kveksiene, 32, and her husband, 38-year-old Bronius
Kveksa, committed the latest murder last week at their house in
Kisiniai, a small village some 300 kilometers (180 miles) west
Vilnius, said the newspaper, Lithuania's largest daily.
	   Fellow workers of Kveksiene at a fish-processing plant went to
police when she failed to explain where her child was after
returning from maternity leave, the newspaper said.
	   Police then searched the couple's home, and found charred human
remains in the oven of the house, the report said, citing police
sources.
	   Another newborn was reportedly killed the same way eight years
ago. A third child was killed five years ago, though it wasn't
clear how, the report said.
	   The report did not say what police thought was the motive for
the murders.
	   The couple have two school-aged children, who are now in the
custody of relatives, the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
	   IZINGOLWENI, South Africa (AP) _ African National Congress
officials on Monday blamed political rivals for the burning of 16
houses belonging to ANC supporters in this southern Indian Ocean
coastal area.
	   Police arrested four suspects and are investigating the alleged
arson, which occurred late Sunday afternoon, said police
Superintendent Dawood Kader.
	   Kader said he could not confirm the political connection, and
attributed the attack to ``criminal elements.''
	   The ANC said the houses belonged to seven families who had been
threatened by Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party supporters.
Inkatha's political base is in KwaZulu-Natal, which includes the
traditional Zulu homeland.
	   An Inkatha official said the ANC comments were ``reckless'' and
would prejudge the police investigation.
	   ``We have lost 30 members who have been killed in this village
this year, and not once have we charged it was the ANC,'' Mntomuhle
Khawula, a regional Inkatha elected official, said in a telephone
interview.

Missing Italian star appeals latest club fine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHEFFIELD, England (AP) _ Paolo Di Canio has appealed against
being fined another two weeks wages by Sheffield Wednesday and
seems no closer to returning to the club even though his 11-game
ban for pushing over a referee has ended.
	   The Italian star, suspended by the Football Association two
months ago, should have returned to Sheffield to prepare for his
expected return on Saturday against Leicester.
	   But the former Lazio, AC Milan and Juventus player is nine days
late returning from Rome, where he has been staying during his
suspension, and Wednesday has already fined him four weeks wages,
reportedly amounting to 68,000 pounds (dlrs 113,500) for being
late.
	   Now the club is threatening to put Di Canio on the transfer list
and fine him another two weeks wages and that's what the Italian is
complaining about.
	   ``I understand from the Premier League he has appealed against
the imposition of our suspension for his failure to report back,''
said Wednesday secretary Graham Mackrell.
	   Di Canio's agent, Moreno Roggi, says the player is suffering
from stress and depression and is unlikely to fly back until Jan. 4
at the earliest.
	   That has angered Wednesday even more, espeically as they have
had little contact with the star.
	   ``We are hoping he will return but any suggestion of us flying
out to talk to him are out of the question,'' Mackrell said.
	   ``He is a contracted employee of Sheffield Wednesday Football
Club and we are entitled to expect him to work. There are 206
employees at this club. We don't go looking for them when they
don't turn up. We end up demeaning ourselves.
	   ``It's not a pride issue either,'' Mackrell said. ``Ours was a
formal instruction and Paolo was meant to turn up for work. But he
has not done so.''

Ukraine's government finalizes new 1999 budget draft
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's government on Monday prepared a
revised version of the 1999 budget draft for the second reading in
parliament, sharply changing targets earlier approved by lawmakers.
	   Parliament raised the government's original revenue target by
nearly 50 percent and limited the deficit to zero before approving
the budget in the first reading last week.
	   The Cabinet, however, strongly objected Monday to the
parliament's move and restored the budget's primary targets to
almost the same ones the government originally proposed.
	   The budget needs to pass three readings in parliament before
final approval.
	   The new draft, to be debated by lawmakers this week, lowered
planned revenues to 23.3 billion hryvna (dlrs 6.8 billion), and
raised the deficit to 1.2 billion hryvna (dlrs 362 million), or 1
percent of gross domestic product.
	   Government officials have argued that with Ukraine's economy
expected to further decline in 1999 and with mounting debt
obligations, the former Soviet republic cannot count on revenues
and expenditures as high as parliament wanted.
	   They also said the budget should include a small deficit to
allow the government more money to cover the huge wage and pension
arrears.
	   Parliament speaker Oleksandr Tkachenko said Monday lawmakers
would debate the budget Thursday, and called on legislators to
approve the document by the end of the year.
	   However, the disagreement over budget indicators has complicated
the debate, and many lawmakers are already voicing doubt that
Ukraine will have a budget before the new year.
	   Just in case, parliament's budget committee drafted a bill
instructing the government how to spend its 1999 revenues if the
budget isn't approved in time.

Probe finds no health risks in hangar where crash wreckage lay
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Investigators said Monday they
could not link health problems suffered by some KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines staff to their work in a hangar that held wreckage of an
El Al Boeing 747 that crashed in 1992.
	   The independent four-month investigation was launched after KLM
employees complained of fatigue, nausea and breathing problems
after working in the hangar at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport.
	   The KLM employees blamed working next to the El Al wreckage for
their health problems. But investigators from the Netherlands
Organization for Applied Scientific Research said they found no
chemicals in high enough concentrations to pose a health risk.
	   The researchers based their findings on dust samples taken from
the hangar.
	   The El Al's cargo remains controversial more than six years
after the jet plowed into an apartment block on Oct. 4, 1992.
Residents in the neighborhood where the plane came down also have
complained of health problems they link to the crash.
	   Israeli authorities have confirmed that the Israel-bound plane
was carrying raw materials that could be used in manufacturing the
deadly nerve gas sarin.

Iraq says military casualty minimal in U.S.-British airstrikes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series; minor editing throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz,
said on Monday that 62 soldiers were killed and 180 injured in four
nights of U.S.-British airstrikes.
	   This was the first official death toll from the punishing
assault that ended Saturday. Previously, it was reported that 42
Iraqis were killed and 96 wounded, but there was no breakdown of
that figure for civilians or military casualties.
	   Aziz said civilian casualties are ``much much higher than
military casualties.'' He refused to elaborate, saying the health
ministry will give a civilian toll.
	   He declared the U.N. weapons inspection program is now over, and
the only solution is the lifting of economic sanctions imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Aziz released the casualty figures at a news conference to back
his claim that the United States has failed to make any dent in the
Iraqi military despite going out with a clear aim to target the
Republican Guard, the core of the Iraqi army.
	   ``They boasted of great success ... They lied,'' Aziz said.
	   He said two officers and 16 soldiers of the Special Republican
Guard were killed. The Republican Guard, which has some 70,000
personnel, lost one officer and 19 soldiers.
	   In other branches of the army, including air defense, four
officers and 20 others were killed.
	   ``Four days of intensive bombings with all the smart missiles
and bombs .... this shows what these people are in reality. They
lie. They dis-inform and misinform the people and the world,'' Aziz
said.
	   He said the airstrikes destroyed barracks of Republican and
Special Republican Guards, adding that they can easily be rebuilt.
	   However, ``the serious damage was in civilian sites,'' he said,
calling it ``the American way of war.''
	   They attacked almost all industrial sites, government buildings,
party buildings, radio and television facilities, communications,
hospitals, private homes and schools.
	   ``This is a policy of hatred, an imperialist colonial policy.
This is not a policy based on international law,'' Aziz said.
	   ``This is a criminal aggression,'' he said.
	   Aziz said a diplomatic solution to the Iraq problem can only
come by condemning the United States and Britain, by holding them
accountable and by lifting the sanctions completely.
	   ``Without that, it would be difficult for Iraq to talk,'' he
said.
	   ``Iraq cannot tolerate the embargo and UNSCOM,'' Aziz said,
referring to the United Nations Special Commission, which is
responsible for dismantling the country's weapons of mass
destruction.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair have demanded that Iraq allow UNSCOM to resume work before
any talk of lifting the sanctions can be considered.
	   Asked to react to that, Aziz said: ``We shall never, never
accept any condition made by Clinton or Blair.''
	   ``We did not damage our relations with the United Nations. They
damaged the United Nations itself,'' he said. ``They killed UNSCOM.
UNSCOM is their casualty,'' he said.
	   Aziz said Iraq the aggression against Iraq never stopped since
the 1991 Gulf War to evict Iraq out of Kuwait, and cited the
economic sanctions and the imposition of the no-fly zones in
southern Iraq as examples of aggression.
	   He ridiculed Clinton for saying that the United States took
Islamic sensitivities into consideration while planning the attack
and ending it on the first day of the holy month of Ramadan when
Muslims are required to fast.
	   ``The question is not Ramadan. The question is that they had
assembled a limited amount of assets ... and they wanted to make a
swift and quick aggression,'' he said.
	   Asked to react to the attack on U.S. and British embassies in
Damascus by irate Syrians on Saturday, Aziz said it showed that
Arabs did not support the military strikes.
	   ``They know that the people in the world hate them because they
are criminals,'' he said.
	   Asked to comment on chief weapons inspector Richard Butler's
refusal to resign, Aziz said Butler ``is a cheap pawn in the hands
of the Americans.''
	   ``He's not the issue. The issue is the American and the British
position during the whole period which prevented the Security
Council from taking any serious step toward lifting the
sanctions,'' he said.
	   Iraq has long accused the two countries of deliberately
preventing an end to the sanctions, which have helped reduced the
once-wealthy country to extreme poverty.
	   Aziz said Iraqi authorities will possibly let reporters see the
damage to the military facilities, which so far have been off
limits for journalists.

Zidane wins Golden Ball player of the year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Completing a momentous year for the French star,
Zinedine Zidane won France Football magazine's prestigious player
of the year award on Monday.
	   The first French winner of the Golden Ball since Jean-Pierre
Papin in 1991, Zidane collected 244 points, well ahead of World Cup
top scorer Davor Suker, with 68 points, and last year's winner
Ronaldo, a further two points behind in the poll of journalists
from around Europe.
	   This year, 26-year-old Zidane headed two goals in the World Cup
final to guide France to World Cup glory and, with Juventus, won
the Italian championship and reached the final of the European
Champions League.
	   The epitome of a modern day playmaker, the former Cannes and
Bordeaux star combines a powerful 1.85 meters (6 feet), 80 kilos
(176 pounds) frame with stunning technique, the ability to shoot
and pass brilliantly with either foot, and _ as he showed at
Saint-Denis on July 12 _ to be a matchwinner in the air.
	   In 1998, Zidane was elevated to something more than a great
soccer player, with France's World Cup success propelling ``Zizou''
to hero worship status.
	   As his image was flashed on to the Arc de Triomphe after the
defeat of Brazil, most of the million revelers on the Champs
Elysees began to chant his name.
	   The son of an Algerian immigrant born and brought up in a tough
northern suburb of Marseille, Zidane already enjoyed cult status
among much of France's disaffected North African youth.
	   Hours before the World Cup final, Saint-Denis was crammed with
cars and motorbikes carrying Moroccan, Algerian and Tunisian flags
_ and fans incessantly chanting the name of ``Zizou.''
	   Some political commentators hoped that France's multi-racial
team _ and Zidane in particular _ could help ease some of France's
racial tensions.
	   The anti-immigrant National Front, which had scorned previous
French teams' multi-racial make up, congratulated the World Cup
winners _ and even singled out Zidane for special praise.
	   It wasn't the first time in 1998 that Zidane won support from an
unlikely source
	   During a World Cup warm-up between against Morocco in
Casablanca, fans booed French players mercilessly _ but cheered
every flash of Zidane's brilliance as if he were one of their own.
	   Ironically, Zizou's World Cup had as many lows as highs.
	   Sent off against Saudi Arabia, he was suspended for two games
and feared he that he might have played his last match of the
tournament.
	   But France advanced, and Zidane grew stronger as the tournament
went on _ ultimately outshining Ronaldo in the final.

EU seeks WTO panel after US publishes list of sanctioned products
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with dispute settlement body latest, grafs 8 and 9
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union's Foreign Trade
Commissioner Leon Brittan said the EU will push for a World Trade
Organization solution to its banana dispute with the United States
after Washington unveiled a list of EU goods subject to stiff trade
sanctions.
	   ``As a result of the publication of the U.S. list today, the EU
will accelerate its moves in the WTO for consultations leading to a
panel against US unilateral measures under Section 301 of the U.S.
Trade Act,'' Brittan said in a statement.
	   ``It is time to take action against the pernicious and unlawful
effect of this wholly unilateral legislation,'' he said.
	   Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act effectively allows the U.S.
government to determine whether its trade partners are unfairly
protecting their markets, and to impose retaliatory measures.
	   On Monday the United States published a list of EU products
ranging from sheep's milk cheese to cashmere sweaters that will be
slapped with 100 percent import tariffs.
	   U.S Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said in Washington
the United States is exercising its rights under the WTO to impose
penalties on the EU for, in the U.S. view, unfairly blocking U.S.
companies from selling bananas from Latin America to Europe.
	   But Brittan lashed out at the sanctions, saying, ``it is
difficult to think of a more obvious breach of the multilateral
trade system than to take the law into your own hands in defiance
of the rules.''
	   The WTO's dispute settlement body meeting Monday in Geneva
failed to agree on the EU's plans for a panel or a counter-request
by Ecuador. The members are expected to meet again in early January
when a panel cannot be blocked.
	   ``We are 100 per cent in support of the Ecuadorian panel request
which demonstrates that we want the matter settled in the WTO
rather than in some kangaroo court in the U.S.,'' EU trade
ambassador Rod Abbott told reporters.
	   The United States argues the EU has not done enough to fall in
line with a WTO verdict last year which ruled against the EU's
favorable treatment of a number of African, Caribbean, and Pacific
region countries.
	   The EU says it approved new import regulations to comply with
WTO demands, but the United States and Central and South American
banana producers claim its banana import regime is still
discriminatory.
	   The U.S. sanctions could go into effect as soon as Feb. 2, or as
late as March 3, depending on whether the European Union chooses to
arbitrate the content of the list.

Indian, Russian ties ``solid,'' Primakov says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with India and Russia signing seven agreements,
details. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Russia on Monday backed India's bid for
a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council as the two countries
signed several agreements on expanding military and economic ties.
	   ``India is an appropriate candidate for taking up that
position,'' said Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov of India's
desire to become a permanent member of the Security Council.
	   Primakov, speaking in New Delhi, also put forward his idea of
Russia, India and China forming a strategic triangle. ``This is not
a formal proposal, but the three countries could bring about
greater stability not only in this region but in the entire
world,'' he said.
	   The Russian prime minister said the seven agreements signed by
the two sides, particularly the one extending current military and
technical cooperation through 2010, would ``boost horizontal and
vertical cooperation between the two countries in various areas.''
	   India is a leading buyer of Russian arms and its defense forces
depend up to 80 percent on Russian equipment and spares.
	   India also is negotiating the purchase of an aircraft carrier
from Russia, India's Foreign Secretary K. Raghunath told reporters.
	   India and Russia signed an extradition treaty and an agreement
covering legal assistance in criminal matters to deal with
terrorism, Indian officials say.
	   The economic agreements sought to enhance cooperation in the
steel, power and telecommunication sectors. The two countries also
will study the possibility of jointly undertaking oil exploration
in the two countries and in Central Asian republics.
	   Primakov said President Boris Yeltsin would visit India next
year and the two sides would sign a strategic partnership
agreement,defining long-term relationship in political and other
fields.
	   Yeltsin, who was to visit India this month, put off his visit
after his health deteriorated.
	   Primakov also reiterated Russian criticism of the U.S.-British
bombing of Iraq, an opposition India strongly shares.
	   ``Russia's attitude to the use of force in international
relations bypassing the U.N. Security Council is very much
negative,'' he said. Primakov flew in Sunday on a two-day visit to
India.
	   Primakov's entourage included his finance minister Andrei
Shapovalyants, trade minister Georgy Gabuniya and justice minister
Pavel Krasheninnikov.
	   India is currently building two nuclear reactors purchased from
Russia in a dlrs 2.6 billion contract. Both sides say the reactors
are for energy purposes and cannot be used for military means.

Nerve finding helps explain why emotional memories endure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Hold for release at 2200 GMT. &QL;

 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Why do you remember your high school graduation
so well when you don't have a clue to what you did two days later?
	   In part, a study says, you can thank a nerve that runs to your
brain from deep in your innards.
	   Researchers found that stimulating this nerve in people improves
memory. They say the finding might someday help victims of stroke
or head injury recover faster.
	   The work helps explain why people remember emotionally charged
events _ weddings, deaths, insults _ better than ordinary
happenings.
	   Scientists already know that part of the story is the body's
response to emotional arousal: The body releases adrenaline and
other hormones into the blood. But for the most part, those
hormones can't get into the brain. So how could they influence
memory?
	   The new work points to the vagus (pronounced VAY-gus) nerve,
which extends from the brainstem to most of the body's internal
organs.
	   The vagus nerve is kind of a two-way street. It relays orders
from the brain to regulate things like heart rate, while keeping
the brain informed about what's going on in the organs, such as
whether the stomach is full.
	   Studies in rats have suggested the arousal hormones use the
vagus nerve to tell the brain it should hang on to particular
memories. Now, psychologist Robert A. Jensen of Southern Illinois
University in Carbondale and colleagues report evidence in humans
that the vagus nerve helps make some memories stick.
	   The work appears in the January issue of the journal Nature
Neuroscience.
	   ``This is exciting new information that provides an important
piece of the puzzle'' of how the hormones affect memory, said James
McGaugh, director of the Center for the Neurobiology of Learning
and Memory at the University of California at Irvine.
	   The researchers looked at 10 people involved in a medical study
that was aimed at seeing if an implanted device that stimulates the
vagus nerve could suppress epileptic seizures. The device was
approved for that use by federal regulators last year. Its maker,
Cyberonics Inc., provided some support for the memory study.
	   Participants were tested before and after they got the nerve
stimulators implanted. At each session, they read a series of
paragraphs that included a total of 42 words highlighted with a
yellow marker. After they read, their vagus nerve was stimulated.
	   A short time later, they were tested on whether they could
recognize the target words in a list of about 250 words. They
scored about 36 percent better on recognizing words they'd read
just before nerve stimulation, compared with their performance
before getting the implant.
	   Since the stimulation occurred after the words were read, it
shows the nerve helps the brain store the memory of something that
just happened, rather than alerting the brain to pay attention to
what's coming up.
	   McGaugh said emotional arousal affects memory routinely, not
just during extremely emotional events. Day to day, it's a way to
help the brain separate the wheat from the chaff of life: If
something important has just happened, the body gets aroused enough
to cue the brain to remember it, he said.
	   Scientists have begun studies in rats to see if stimulating the
vagus nerve could speed up recovery after stroke or other brain
damage.
	   McGaugh doubts that nerve stimulation could help people with
Alzheimer's disease or students cramming for tests.
	   His study found that too much nerve stimulation wipes out the
benefit on memory. When cramming, ``your level of arousal is
already up at optimum,'' he said. Stimulating the nerve even more
might actually make it harder for a student to remember the
lessons, he said.

Special forces soldier found dead after climbing trip
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A reserve army special forces soldier was
found drowned in an mountain lake Monday after going on a climbing
trip with a friend, the fire department said.
	   Anestis Anestou, 25, was found by rescue teams on rugged Mount
Parnitha, about 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Athens. His
parents had reported him and his friend Costas Barbas, also 25,
missing on Sunday evening.
	   Barbas, also a special forces reservist, said they had both
fallen into the small icy lake while trying cross a waterfall.
	   Rescue teams found Barbas about six hours before finding his
friend's body. He was hospitalized briefly and treated for broken
ribs, media reports said.
	   The two men, who frequently went on climbing expeditions, had
left for Mount Parnitha on Sunday morning.
	   The fire department coordinates most rescue and disaster relief
operations in Greece.

Bribes scandal could cost British FAs guaranteed FIFA vice
</HEADLINE>
presidency &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The four soccer associations in
Britain may lose their right to a guaranteed FIFA vice president
after the cash-for-votes scandal currently sweeping through the
English Football Association.
	   The English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish FA's have all
had a special arrangement where they can vote for a vice president
of soccer's world governing body. Currently it is Scottish lawyer
David Will.
	   According to Northern Ireland president Jim Boyce, that could
end next year at FIFA's special congress in Los Angeles July 9.
	   ``Three members of the FIFA executive have told me that a motion
calling for the end of the Home Nations' vice-presidency would be
on the agenda at the special congress next July,'' he said.
	   ``That would be a very serious and potentially damaging
development for British football. In the past, the other European
countries have always backed the position of the British Isles but
I'm not sure that they would do now.''
	   Boyce fears that the mood of the other European associations has
moved against the arrangement because of a series of events in the
past 18 months.
	   Some were annoyed that England broke an alleged agreement with
Germany not to bid against the Germans in the race to the World Cup
2006. Now the two are rivals.
	   Then the English FA changed its mind and voted against UEFA
president Lennart Johansson in the election for FIFA president.
Johansson, who has most European votes, lost to Sepp Blatter.
	   The FA's 3.2 million pound (dlrs 5 million) payment to the Welsh
FA, interpreted as a bribe to gain a vote for FA chairman Keith
Wiseman in a FIFA/UEFA committee election, could further alienate
the European federations.
	   Will says he hopes the latest scandal will blow over and the
arrangement will stay.
	   ``The events of the past month have obviously not helped,'' he
said. ``But the situation will pass and I would hope that it would
not affect the continuation of the British vice-presidency.''

Iraq: Bombing destroyed missile factories, killed 62 soldiers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES BC-Iraq-Casualty; CHANGES overline &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.S. and British airstrikes demolished
Iraq's two main factories for producing parts for short-range
missiles permitted by the United Nations, Iraqi officials said
Monday.
	   Also Monday, Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, said the
four nights of airstrikes killed 62 soldiers and injured 180
others. He said civilian casualties were ``much much higher,'' but
he did not give figures.
	   ``The serious damage was in civilian sites,'' Aziz said, calling
it ``the American way of war.'' Sites attacked included hospitals,
private homes and schools, he said.
	   Despite the four days of attacks, Aziz maintained the United
States had failed to make any dent in the Iraqi military might.
	   ``They boasted of great success .... They lied,'' he said.
	   Previous reports had said 42 people were killed but they didn't
make it clear how many were civilians or soldiers.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, had said during the
weekend that thousands of people were killed or injured, but did
not substantiate that claim.
	   Iraqi authorities have not taken foreign journalists to sites
where there were significant civilian casualties as they have in
the past _ a likely indication that civilian casualties either were
not high or were scattered.
	   Aziz said the United States and Britain should be called to
account for their actions, and then the U.N. economic sanctions
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait should be lifted.
	   He declared the weapons inspection program of the United Nations
Special Commission is now over, and the only solution would be
lifting of economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
	   ``Iraq cannot tolerate the embargo and UNSCOM,'' Aziz said,
adding that the British and the American attacks have ``killed
UNSCOM.''
	   ``UNSCOM is their casualty,'' he said.
	   The commission is responsible for dismantling Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction _ chemical, biological or nuclear weapons and
missiles with ranges in excess of 150 kilometers (90 miles).
	   In halting the airstrikes Saturday, President Clinton said the
70-hour assault had severely damaged President Saddam Hussein's
ability to build weapons of mass destruction. Clinton ordered the
airstrikes after a report by UNSCOM chief Richard Butler said Iraq
was obstructing the inspectors' work.
	   The attacks on the factories near Baghdad appear to be part of a
strategy to destroy installations that could be used to produce
weapons of mass destruction. Besides the missile facilities, nearly
all of Iraq's military factories were attacked and many sustained
heavy damage, Iraqi officials said, speaking on customary condition
of anonymity.
	   Iraqi officials said that among the sites attacked were the
al-Nasser factory in Taji, 60 kilometers (40 miles) north of
Baghdad, and the al-Nida factory, south of the capital. Al-Nasser
was heavily bombed during the 1991 Gulf War.
	   The officials said the attacks have virtually halted Iraqi
efforts to produce short-range missiles. They said the speed of the
attacks took them by surprise and workers did not have enough time
to remove crucial equipment from either factory.
	   In London, Prime Minister Tony Blair's office said Monday that
the airstrikes targeted 100 sites, leaving Saddam's rule weakened
and the Iraqi air defense system ``in ruins.''
	   The sites targeted included 20 command and control facilities
and nine sites linked to the elite Republican Guard, the British
prime minister's spokesman said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   However, Iraq called the confrontation a victory for its people.
	   In his first public comments since the attacks ended Saturday,
Saddam said in a speech Sunday that Iraq defeated ``enemies of
God.''
	   In the televised address, Saddam told his people, ``God will
repay well and crown your heart with clear victory.''
	   The U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Iraq, Hans von Sponeck,
said Monday that the strikes had disrupted distribution of supplies
under the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program.
	   A U.N. warehouse full of rice in Saddam's hometown of Tikrit was
destroyed during the strikes, von Sponeck told Associated Press
Television News.
	   The oil-for-food program allows Iraq to get around U.N. economic
sanctions by selling limited quantities of oil to buy food and
other humanitarian goods. The distribution of food is monitored by
U.N. workers, who were evacuated to Jordan during the strikes.
	   U.N. officials said the aid workers, more than 100 in all, would
head back to Baghdad on Tuesday.
	   An extremist Islamic group, meanwhile, threatened retaliation
for the airstrikes.
	   Al-Gamaa al-Islamiya, or the Islamic Group, said in a statement
sent to the Cairo office of Al-Hayat newspaper that the attacks
were ``a disgrace to the Islamic nation,'' the paper reported
Monday.
	   The group called for a ``holy war'' against the United States
and a boycott of American and British products in the Muslim world.
	   Anonymous calls to Al-Hayat also threatened attacks on Kuwaiti
embassies and ``American interests'' in the Gulf.

Opposition parliamentarians: IOC is no place for a prince
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The scandal-hit International
Olympic Committee is no place for Prince Willem-Alexander, heir to
the throne, Dutch opposition parliamentarians said Monday.
	   ``Recent reports prove again that the IOC is mixed up with
dubious practices,'' Paul Rosenmoeller, leader of the Green Left
party told the daily NRC Handelsblad newspaper. ``That is not the
ideal company for our future king.''
	   The IOC was plunged into crisis earlier this month when a senior
member publicly charged the process of voting for future Olympic
hosts was marked by corruption and vote-buying. Switzerland's Marc
Hodler estimated that 5 to 7 percent of the 115 members are open to
bribery.
	   The IOC has launched an investigation into Salt Lake City's
successful bid to host the 2002 Winter Games. Salt Lake organizers
admit having a dlrs 400,000 scholarship fund, some of which
benettied IOC members' families, but have said this was a
humanitarian gesture rather than bribery.
	   Dutch IOC member Anton Geesink on Monday denied a report in
German magazine Der Spiegel that he was one of five members
implicated in the investigation. Der Spiegel did not elaborate.
	   ``I took no money from Salt Lake City or anybody else,'' the
64-year-old said in a statement cited by Dutch television news. ``I
also never sent any children to study in America at their expense.
They must have me confused with somebody else.''
	   Rosenmoeller was supported by the Socialist Party, but members
of the three parties making up the ruling coalition said they
wanted to wait for the results of the IOC investigation before
debating the prince's IOC membership.
	   The sports-minded prince was elected to the IOC at the Winter
Olympics in Nagano, Japan, but is only due to be officially
installed in June.
	   The Royal House declined comment on the prince's membership.

Liberals capture bulk of votes in St. Petersburg elections

	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Voters in traditionally
pro-Western St. Petersburg sought to end a wave of deadly, dirty
politics, and gave liberal candidates the biggest chunk of seats in
city council elections, according to preliminary results Monday.
	   Liberal candidates capitalized on voter anger over lawlessness
in Russia's second-largest city, campaigning on anti-crime,
anti-corruption platforms. The run-up to the election was tainted
by contract hits, beatings of the candidates, and reports of vote
buying.
	   Sunday's runoff was seen as a test of the strength of liberal
groups nationwide, which have been in disarray recently. The vote
also attracted nationwide attention after a leading liberal
legislator was killed in St. Petersburg last month.
	   Only six of the 50 seats were filled in the first round of
voting Dec. 6. But the Sunday runoff, with a turnout of about 32
percent, didn't produce the sweeping victory many liberals
expected.
	   Three liberal parties captured a combined total of 24 seats in
both rounds of voting. Communist groups _ who enjoy much greater
support elsewhere in Russia _ took five seats and independents and
smaller parties took the remaining 21, according to the City
Electoral Commission.
	   The largest single block, winning 15 seats, was the local
liberal group led by Yuri Boldyrev.
	   It was followed by local representatives of Russia's main
liberal party Yabloko, headed by Grigory Yavlinsky, from which
Boldyrev's movement splintered off several years ago. Yabloko won
eight seats, up from three in the previous city council.
	   Many of the independents were expected to side with liberals.
	   ``Today in St. Petersburg, Communists present no danger to
anybody,'' Boldyrev said on Russia's Hero of the Day television
program after the vote results were announced Monday.
	   But there have been other dangers.
	   During the election campaign, attackers beat one candidate with
metal rods, and the windows of a city council member's apartment
were shot out.
	   The most shocking event was the death of Galina Starovoitova,
one of the country's leading liberal politicians. She was killed by
unidentified gunmen on Nov. 20 outside her St. Petersburg
apartment.
	   Observers also reported vote buying and busing of pensioners to
election sites. Some losers immediately demanded recounts.
	   Boldyrev candidate Oleg Sergeyev, who won a seat Sunday after
being beaten up during his campaign, welcomed the liberals' victory
as a triumph over ``image makers and criminal organizations'' who
tried to trick voters. Two other candidates appeared on the ballot
with Sergeyev's name, a tactic to confuse voters that was
widespread in this election.
	   ``These elections were trash,'' said taxi driver Oleg Kuznetsov.
``Somebody came to my house and offered me 35 rubles (dlrs 1.67) to
vote for somebody else, I forget who, I was so insulted.''
	   Disillusionment was widespread.
	   ``It won't change anything. There's no point in voting,'' said
Sergei Tsigikalo, a 30-year-old construction worker who conceded he
was ``worried'' about crime.
	   The new deputies will enter a city council that grants its
members a much stronger voice in local affairs than similar bodies
elsewhere in Russia.

Iraq: Bombing destroyed missile factories, killed 62 soldiers

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.S. and British airstrikes demolished
Iraq's two main factories for producing parts for short-range
missiles permitted by the United Nations, Iraqi officials said
Monday.
	   The four nights of airstrikes also killed 62 soldiers and
injured 180 others, said Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz.
He said civilian casualties were ``much, much higher,'' but he did
not give figures.
	   ``The serious damage was in civilian sites,'' Aziz said, calling
it ``the American way of war.'' Sites attacked included hospitals,
private homes and schools, he said.
	   Despite the four days of attacks, the United States had failed
to make any dent in the Iraqi military might, Aziz said.
	   ``They boasted of great success .... They lied,'' he said.
	   During the weekend, Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, had
said that thousands of people were killed or injured, but did not
substantiate that claim.
	   Iraqi authorities have not taken foreign journalists to sites
where there were significant civilian casualties as they have in
the past _ a likely indication that civilian casualties either were
not high or were scattered.
	   Aziz said the United States and Britain should be called to
account for their actions, and then the U.N. economic sanctions
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait should be lifted.
	   He declared the weapons inspection program of the United Nations
Special Commission over, and the only solution would be lifting of
economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   ``Iraq cannot tolerate the embargo and UNSCOM,'' Aziz said,
adding that the British and the American attacks have ``killed
UNSCOM.''
	   ``UNSCOM is their casualty,'' he said.
	   The commission is responsible for dismantling Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction _ chemical, biological or nuclear weapons and
missiles with ranges in excess of 150 kilometers (90 miles).
	   In halting the airstrikes Saturday, U.S. President Bill Clinton
said the 70-hour assault had severely damaged President Saddam
Hussein's ability to build weapons of mass destruction. Clinton
ordered the airstrikes after a report by UNSCOM chief Richard
Butler said Iraq was obstructing the inspectors' work.
	   The attacks on the factories near Baghdad appear to be part of a
strategy to destroy installations that could be used to produce
weapons of mass destruction. Besides the missile facilities, nearly
all of Iraq's military factories were attacked and many sustained
heavy damage, Iraqi officials said, speaking on customary condition
of anonymity.
	   Iraqi officials said that among the sites attacked were the
al-Nasser factory in Taji, 60 kilometers (40 miles) north of
Baghdad, and the al-Nida factory, south of the capital. Al-Nasser
was heavily bombed during the 1991 Gulf War.
	   The officials said the attacks have virtually halted Iraqi
efforts to produce short-range missiles. They said the speed of the
attacks took them by surprise and workers did not have enough time
to remove crucial equipment from either factory.
	   In London, Prime Minister Tony Blair's office said Monday that
the airstrikes targeted 100 sites, leaving Saddam's rule weakened
and the Iraqi air defense system ``in ruins.''
	   The sites targeted included 20 command and control facilities
and nine sites linked to the elite Republican Guard, the British
prime minister's spokesman said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   However, Iraq called the confrontation a victory for its people.
	   In his first public comments since the attacks ended Saturday,
Saddam said in a speech Sunday that Iraq defeated ``enemies of
God.''
	   In the televised address, Saddam told his people, ``God will
repay well and crown your heart with clear victory.''
	   The U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Iraq, Hans von Sponeck,
said Monday that the strikes had disrupted distribution of supplies
under the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program.
	   A U.N. warehouse full of rice in Saddam's hometown of Tikrit was
destroyed during the strikes, von Sponeck told Associated Press
Television News.
	   The oil-for-food program allows Iraq to get around U.N. economic
sanctions by selling limited quantities of oil to buy food and
other humanitarian goods. The distribution of food is monitored by
U.N. workers, who were evacuated to Jordan during the strikes.
	   U.N. officials said the aid workers, more than 100 in all, would
head back to Baghdad on Tuesday.
	   An extremist Islamic group, meanwhile, threatened retaliation
for the airstrikes.
	   Al-Gamaa al-Islamiya, or the Islamic Group, said in a statement
sent to the Cairo office of Al-Hayat newspaper that the attacks
were ``a disgrace to the Islamic nation,'' the paper reported
Monday.
	   The group called for a ``holy war'' against the United States
and a boycott of American and British products in the Muslim world.
	   Anonymous calls to Al-Hayat also threatened attacks on Kuwaiti
embassies and ``American interests'' in the Gulf.

Parents arrested in Lithuania for killing newborns

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) - A Lithuanian couple has been arrested
on charges of murdering three of their newborn children, burning at
least two of them alive in their stove at home, the newspaper
Lietuvos Rytas reported Monday.
	   Danguole Kveksiene, 32, and her husband, 38-year-old Bronius
Kveksa, committed the latest murder last week at their house in
Kisiniai, a small village some 300 kilometers (180 miles) west
Vilnius, said the newspaper, Lithuania's largest daily.
	   Fellow workers of Kveksiene at a fish-processing plant went to
police when she failed to explain where her child was after
returning from maternity leave, the newspaper said.
	   Police then searched the couple's home, and found charred human
remains in the oven of the house, the report said, citing police
sources.
	   Another newborn was reportedly killed the same way eight years
ago. A third child was killed five years ago, though it wasn't
clear how, the report said.
	   The report did not say what police thought was the motive for
the murders.
	   The couple have two school-aged children, who are now in the
custody of relatives, the newspaper said.

Polish miners hold warning strike over pension reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 6-8 with comments from union official, ADDS
details, byline
 &UR; By ANDRZEJ STYLINSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Miners in southern Poland held a warning
strike Monday to protest pension reforms and vote on whether to
call a general strike.
	   The PAP state news agency reported that workers at coal mines in
Silesia, as well as zinc and lead ore mines, began the two-hour
strike Monday morning.
	   Union officials said the strike would be observed at all Polish
mines by the end of the day, with workers on each shift getting the
chance to vote on whether to begin a general strike on an
undetermined date.
	   Results of the vote were not expected until Tuesday.
	   Miners were expected to favor a general strike, and union
leaders planned to meet government representatives and mine company
officials on Tuesday before deciding how to proceed.
	   However, Solidarity Chairman Marian Krzaklewski, who visited
strikers at the Andaluzja mine in Piekary Slaskie, about 260
kilometers (160 miles) south of Warsaw, said he expected that
agreement with the government could be reached by Wednesday.
	   He said the Solidarity-led government did not mean to deprive
miners of early retirement privileges, but what remains to be
solved is how to finance early pensions.
	   Krzaklewski said he hoped the agreement would allow striking
miners to return home for Christmas.
	   At least 415 workers at 50 coal mines continued an underground
sit-in Monday in their campaign against proposed changes in
retirement rules, PAP reported.
	   Parliament has approved setting retirement age limits of 65 for
men and 60 for women. Under the current formula, miners and others
working in dangerous conditions could retire with full pensions
after 25 years of work, no matter their age.
	   While the proposed changes would continue to allow for early
retirement for at least seven more years, mining unions say they
want the present system to remain intact. They also oppose a mining
restructuring plan that would cut jobs and production.
	   The government is working on the so-called ``bridge pensions''
to be paid to miners retiring after 25 years of work and until they
become eligible to regular pensions at 65.
	   Krzaklewski said bridge pensions should not be lower than
regular pensions.
	   Mining, one of Poland's major industries, is undergoing reforms
as the economy completes the shift from communist-style central
control to free market principles.

Winning and losing in the Year of the Tiger
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates version transmitted Dec. 16 with U.S.-British air
strikes against Iraq and Afghanistan-Sudan missile attacks &QL; 
 &UR; By CHARLES J. HANLEY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Special Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   In the drowned villages of China and Central America, along the
stormy coasts of California and Peru, man met nature in 1998 and
came out a loser. It was, by one reckoning, the costliest year on
record for weather disasters.
	   But when it came to man vs. man in 1998, in the contest between
war and peace, right and wrong, mankind sometimes, in small ways,
looked like a winner.
	   That was the look on Good Friday in Belfast, when a new
beginning was found for Northern Ireland. It was the look one
midsummer midnight in Rome, when weary negotiators put the last
touches to a new global court for war crimes. And it was the look
after an October all-nighter beside Chesapeake Bay, where Israeli
and Palestinian nudged each other a few more steps down the road to
peace.
	   ``There has been enough destruction, enough death, enough
waste,'' Jordan's King Hussein said that day. ``... We are moving
in the right direction.''
	   The right direction _ in small ways, in some places. But in many
others in 1998, there seemed no limit to death and destruction.
	   One Friday in August, twin bombs struck at soft spots in
America's anti-terrorist armor, devastating U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania, killing 224 people.
	   Washington retaliated with cruise missiles against suspected
terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan, and posted a dlrs 5
million reward for the alleged mastermind of the embassy bombings,
Saudi exile Osama bin Laden.
	   Four months later, in December, the United States unleashed its
missiles again, this time in a four-day air campaign against Saddam
Hussein's Iraq.
	   In the Balkans, in the eighth year of a bloody decade, it was
Kosovo's turn to bleed. Serbia went on the attack against Albanian
separatist guerrillas in that Serbian province, filling the forests
and hillsides with cowering refugees.
	   And in other sorrowful corners of the world, from Algeria to
Burundi to long-suffering Sri Lanka, the strife of religion or
``tribe'' tilted the balance once more, in 1998, against peace.
	   Death came, too, from man's failures in another arena, mastering
his own technology. Ninety-six people were killed in the crash of
Germany's fastest train, and 229 perished in the looping,
horrifying and unexplained plunge of a Swissair jetliner into the
chill sea off Nova Scotia.
	   The Year of the Tiger was to have been a year of ``optimism and
energy.'' But the forecast that mattered in 1998 came not from the
Chinese zodiac, but from the weatherman.
	   From the year's first days, severe storms spawned by the El Nino
phenomenon raked the eastern Pacific rim. In California, houses
slid down muddy hillsides and crops were total losses.
	   Peru was hardest hit. Floods and mudslides drove hundreds of
thousands of Peruvians from their homes and washed away vast swaths
of farmland. ``I'm waiting for the earth to open up and swallow
Peru. It's the only thing that hasn't happened,'' said one farmer.
	   Nature then shifted its fury to China.
	   Armies of sandbaggers could not hold back the Yangtze and other
flooded rivers as they inflicted catastrophic damage through the
summer: More than 5.6 million houses were destroyed and almost 64
million acres of land swamped, an area the size of Colorado or
Italy. More than 3,600 people were reported killed.
	   A deadlier event was still to come, halfway around the world,
where a hurricane dubbed Mitch meandered through the Caribbean and
finally settled over the Honduran coast, to sit and torment the
people of Central America with an unimaginable scourge of rain _ up
to 25 inches (62.5 centimeters) a day.
	   Swollen brown torrents flooded towns. Collapsing hillsides
engulfed villages. Bridges and highways vanished, and national
economies dissolved in the muddy runoff. More than 9,000 people
died.
	   ``In two days, we went backwards 50 years,'' lamented the
Honduran archbishop.
	   Even in Bangladesh, homeland of misfortune, 1998 was
extraordinary: Flooded rivers displaced one-quarter of its 124
million people. In India, a cyclone and tidal wave swept away up to
14,000 people, many of them destitute salt workers who lived _ and
died _ beside the Arabian Sea.
	   Weather-related disasters in 1998 caused at least dlrs 89
billion in economic losses worldwide, the Washington-based
Worldwatch Institute estimated. It was the most, by far, in two
decades of recordkeeping.
	   While weather afflicted the masses, climate troubled their
leaders.
	   Envoys from 160 nations, aware of projections that 1998 would be
the planet's warmest year on record, met in Argentina and took
further small steps toward carrying out a year-old accord to combat
global warming.
	   In other meetings in other conference halls, some of the
century's ``intractable'' problems grudgingly gave ground.
	   A negotiating marathon in Belfast produced ``a bloody miracle,''
in one participant's words, a deal to end decades of violence by
giving the Irish Republic a voice in governing Northern Ireland. In
Maryland, the bay-side Middle East talks, brokered by President
Clinton, led to new Israeli withdrawals from Palestinian land.
	   But U.S. efforts elsewhere proved less satisfying.
	   American brinkmanship did pressure Serbia into pulling back
troops from Kosovo, and twice forced Iraq to back off in
confrontations over U.N. weapons inspections.
	   But in a third Iraq showdown, in mid-December as Clinton himself
stood on the brink of impeachment, the U.S. commander-in-chief took
the next step and sent cruise missiles and warplanes against Iraqi
targets, damaging Iraq's advanced-weapons program and inflicting
untold casualties.

<TEXT>
	   For all the diplomatic and military might deployed, both
challenges _ in Iraq and Kosovo _ looked sure to flare anew in
1999.
	   The world confronted a nuclear challenge as well in 1998. First
India, then Pakistan exploded test bombs at secret desert sites,
defying the U.S.-led nonproliferation regime.
	   In other ways, however, 1998 was a year for cooperation _ for
building, brick by brick, structures for the next century.
	   In the U.S. Senate and elsewhere, NATO parliaments began giving
final approval to opening the alliance to Eastern Europe in 1999.
The European Union cleared the way for its new continental
currency, the euro, in the new year. And global powers teamed up,
through billions in new loans, to contain an economic crisis that
had impoverished millions, almost overnight, in East Asia and
Russia.
	   In Rome, the newly negotiated war crimes court was born with a
defect: The United States, wary of putting its soldiers under the
court's jurisdiction, refused to sign on. Kofi Annan, U.N.
secretary-general, hailed it nonetheless as a ``giant step
forward.''
	   For the human rights movement, the year was topped off with the
unexpected. A Spanish warrant alleging genocide and terrorism
snared the aged ex-dictator of Chile, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, as he
visited London. Depending on its outcome, the case could turn this
century's ``untouchables'' into wanted men in the next.
	   More of those untouchables fell in 1998, including one of the
most durable authoritarians, Indonesia's President Suharto, who
stepped down under the relentless pressure of economic collapse and
bloody rioting.
	   ``We don't know if this means democracy or freedom, but it means
change,'' said one happy Indonesian. ``And change is good.''
	   The right direction _ in small ways, in some places. Even, at
times, in the age-old contest of man and nature.
	   Some such steps were quiet _ when scientists, for example,
finally unlocked the genetic secrets of tuberculosis, one of the
great human killers.
	   And some were noisier _ like the blastoff of the first pieces of
the International Space Station, a 16-nation research platform that
should help define the coming age, and from whose lofty perch,
vintage 1998, man may someday look down and reflect: That had to be
a winning year.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Completing a momentous year for the French star,
Zinedine Zidane won France Football magazine's prestigious player
of the year award on Monday.
	   The first French winner of the Golden Ball since Jean-Pierre
Papin in 1991, Zidane collected 244 points, well ahead of World Cup
top scorer Davor Suker, with 68 points, and last year's winner
Ronaldo, a further two points behind in the poll of journalists
from around Europe.
	   This year, 26-year-old Zidane headed two goals in the World Cup
final to guide France to World Cup glory and, with Juventus, won
the Italian championship and reached the final of the European
Champions League.
	   ``I'm moved, and happy to be the fourth Frenchman to win the
Golden Ball award,'' Zidane said after receiving the prize.
	   ``I must share this with my teammates without whom this would've
been impossible. But this is also a personal thing.''
	   Shortly before the presentation, members of France's World
Cup-winning squad also congratulated Zidane in recorded video
messages.

Auditor accuses Yeltsin of campaign contribution scam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A liberal auditor on Monday accused two of
Russia's largest companies of giving campaign contributions to
President Boris Yeltsin in exchange for tax breaks, a news report
said.
	   Yuri Boldyrev, deputy chief of the parliament's Auditing
Chamber, did not specify the amount of the contributions allegedly
made by the natural gas giant Gazprom and the energy monopoly
Unified Energy Systems during the 1996 presidential election.
	   In exchange for the donation to Gazprom, for example, Boldyrev
charged that Yeltsin authorized the transfer of a 33 percent stake
in Gazprom from the government to the company's chairman for
management under proxy, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Gazprom made 33 trillion rubles (about dlrs 6 million) from the
stake, but paid only a fraction of the profit taxes it owed,
Boldyrev told a meeting of the parliamentary anti-corruption
commission.
	   Tax collection has been a chronic problem for the Russian
government and Gazprom has been one of the biggest debtors.
	   The Auditing Chamber is appointed by the Communist-dominated
parliament, which frequently accuses the government of economic
mismanagement and corruption, usually without offering evidence.
	   No action has been taken on most accusations made by the chamber
in the past.
	   Yeltsin's opponents in the 1996 race accused him of bleeding
government coffers to finance his campaign.

Ukraine's chief prosecutor asks parliament to arrest ex-premier
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's chief prosecutor's office asked
parliament Monday to revoke the immunity of former Prime Minister
Pavlo Lazarenko so that he could be arrested and put on trial on
corruption charges.
	   The prosecutor's office ``is ready to charge Lazarenko with
undisputed facts'' of stealing 2.1 million hryvna (dlrs 612,000) of
government funds and illegally stashing about dlrs 4 million in
foreign bank accounts, chief prosecutor Mykhailo Potebenko said.
	   The request to parliament was filed three days after Lazarenko
was released on bail from a jail in Switzerland following his
arrest by Swiss police on suspicion of money laundering.
	   Lazarenko, the 45-year-old leader of the opposition Hromada
party, heads his party's faction in parliament.
	   Potebenko told a news conference that his office was
investigating several other cases against Lazarenko, some of them
jointly with Swiss police, that involved dlrs 17 million allegedly
earned illegally.
	   Ukrainian authorities have long maintained that Lazarenko used
his time as prime minister from May 1996 to July 1997 to siphon
huge profits from the distribution of natural gas in this former
Soviet republic.
	   Several cantons (states) in Switzerland launched their own
money-laundering investigations against Lazarenko, which resulted
in his arrest on Dec. 2.
	   The Swiss have handed over some bank documents to Ukraine upon
prosecutors' requests, and frozen an undisclosed amount of money in
accounts they say are linked to Lazarenko.
	   Potebenko said Ukrainian and Swiss investigators were continuing
to probe ``several episodes,'' and said some of the funds linked to
the former prime minister were deposited in countries other than
Switzerland.
	   Potebenko's deputy, Mykola Obikhod, told the news conference
that Lazarenko could face up to 15 years in prison if convicted in
Ukraine.
	   But under Ukraine's constitution, a lawmaker can be prosecuted
only if parliament lifts his immunity. It was unclear whether
parliament would support the prosecutor's request.
	   Lazarenko has maintained that the Ukrainian government is trying
to discredit him and his opposition party before presidential
elections in October 1999.
	   Under questioning by Swiss investigators in the past two weeks,
Lazarenko admitted moving money to Swiss accounts, but vowed that
it had no criminal connections.
	   Lazarenko's aide said Monday the former premier had arrived in
Kiev and was preparing to speak to parliament about the Swiss
charges against him.

Leptospirosis kills 7 in Kazakstan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An outbreak of a rodent-carried disease has killed
at least seven people and infected more than 2,000 in eastern
Kazakstan, health officials in the central Asian nation said
Monday.
	   The city of Ust-Kamenogorsk has been worst hit by the
leptospirosis outbreak, and authorities have ordered the
disinfection of stores, apartments and offices, the ITAR-Tass news
agency cited the regional health department as saying.
	   Seven people have died and more than 2,000 have contracted the
disease, which is spread by rodents and causes liver and kidney
failure. The report did not say when the victims died.
	   The cash-strapped regional government has allocated 2 million
tenge (dlrs 24,000) to combat the outbreak and local doctors have
asked neighboring Russia for help, ITAR-Tass said.

Two independent journalists acquitted of insulting president
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DARKO LABOR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Two journalists retried after the
prosecution appealed their initial acquittal were on Monday again
found innocent of insulting President Franjo Tudjman, the state-run
HINA agency reported.
	   Viktor Ivancic, the former editor-in chief of the independent
weekly Feral Tribune, and reporter Marinko Culic were acquitted of
the charges in 1996, but a new trial opened a year ago after the
prosecution appealed.
	   In an April 1996 edition of Feral Tribune, Culic scorned
Tudjman's plan for burying victims of Jasenovac - the most
notorious concentration camp of Croatia's World War II Nazi puppet
state - together with members of the Nazi regime.
	   Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and Croats were slaughtered by the tens of
thousands _ some experts claim hundreds of thousands _ in
Jasenovac.
	   Tudjman's idea came under harsh criticism at home and abroad,
mostly from Jasenovac victims and their relatives who oppose mixing
the bones of those killed their with those of their persecutors.
	   In the article, entitled ``Bones in the Mixer,'' Culic compared
Tudjman's policies to those of fascist Spanish dictator Francisco
Franco.
	   When presenting the idea, Tudjman mentioned Franco, saying that
by burying together members of two national movements, the Spanish
dictator worked toward reconciliation.
	   If two were found guilty, they could have faced up to three
years in prison. Prosecutors, however, can again appeal the Zagreb
district court ruling.
	   It was the first such trial in Croatia under new legislation on
insulting top state officials.
	   Critics in Croatia and abroad say such trials are reminiscent of
Communist repression of the media and are in fact an attempt by the
authoritarian government to silence critics and clamp down on
independent media.
	   Dinko Sakic, a commader at Jasenovac, is awaiting trial in
Croatia after being indicted for war crimes recently. He was
extradited in June from Argentina, where he had led a quiet
existence since after the war.

Mob burns to death four suspected thieves in Guatemala lynching
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A mob of as many as 3,000 people captured
four men as they allegedly tried to rob a house, then beat the
suspects, doused them with gasoline and burned them, police
reported Monday.
	   The lynchings on Sunday _ which brought the total of such
killings in Guatemala to 38 this year _ took place in the village
of Campur, about 55 miles (90 kms) north of Guatemala City.
	   The four men were carrying AK-47 assault rifles and were
reportedly trying to rob a house when the villagers, who said they
knew the men from past crimes, captured them and took away their
guns, the National Civil Police reported.
	   The four, who ranged in age from 20 to 32 years, reportedly
belonged to a local gang known as the `Temerarios' _ the Daring
Ones.
	   Local residents beat the men and burned them. However, it is
unclear whether the men were already dead when doused with
gasoline.
	   The wave of lynchings has stimulated by increasing criminal
activity in Guatemala and complaints about the country's unwieldy,
inefficient legal system.

Security tight at U.S., British embassies after attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Syria's ruling coalition condemning airstrikes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ The governing coalition in Syria on
Monday denounced the recent U.S.-British airstrikes on Iraq as ``a
treacherous aggression'' that violated all international norms.
	   On Saturday, more than 1,000 demonstrators, mostly students, had
attacked the U.S. and British embassies and their cultural
institutes to protest the strikes.
	   ``We sharply denounce and severely condemn this aggression,'' a
statement by the National Progressive Front was quoted as saying by
the official Syrian Arab News Agency.
	   The NPF, a coalition of seven parties led by the Baath Party,
said ``it found the treacherous American-British aggression on ...
the people of Iraq a flagrant violation of all international
values, laws and conventions.''
	   Iraq says 62 soldiers were killed and 180 injured in the
four-night attack that ended Saturday.
	   On Monday, scores of riot police remained deployed around the
American and British embassies to prevent a repeat of the Saturday
attacks.
	   The Syrian Foreign Ministry on Sunday expressed regret over the
raids on the embassies and pledged to upgrade security at
diplomatic missions and international organizations.
	   The British ambassador to Damascus, Basil Eastwood, protested to
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa late Saturday for the
attack on the British Embassy and British Council.
	   According to a British Embassy statement, al-Sharaa offered a
``full apology and stressed that there will be suitable protection
for all British buildings and nationals.''

in conjunction with the ATP and WTA tours, will allow players and
coaches to report any unacceptable behavior to the member
association which has the power to take disciplinary action against
offenders.
	   ``The recent case of (Croatia's) Mirjana Lucic, who has alleged
that her father and coach used violence in training her, highlights
the potential problems that can occur between the player and the
coach,'' said ITF executive director Dave Miley.
	   ``The ITF Coaches Commission has become aware of several
countries where sports coaches have been found to have acted
unethically and in some cases these have results in legal action.''
	   The ITF said all its 201 national associations will be
encouraged to incorporate the code of ethics into their coaches
education programs and to ensure that all active coaches sign up to
it.

Death toll rises to 14 in Siberian bus blast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The death toll from a Siberian bus explosion has
risen to 14, a news report said Monday, while a funeral was held
for many of the victims.
	   Investigators said the blast Thursday may have been aimed at
local police, who were sometimes transported in the bus that
exploded, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Police initially said 11 people were killed in the blast, but
told Interfax that the total had risen to 14. The explosion
occurred as the bus passed a gas station in Kiselyovsk, about 3,000
kilometers (1,850 miles) east of Moscow.
	   Some investigators blamed a faulty fuel cylinder in the bus.
	   The passengers reportedly were miners who worked at a nearby
coal mine. A funeral was held for some of the victims Monday,
Interfax said.

Police groups, relatives protest paroles of IRA cop-killers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Officers and relatives railed against a
government decision Monday to free four Irish Republican Army
prisoners convicted of killing policemen.
	   Irish Justice Minister John O'Donoghue said the four _ all less
than midway through what were supposed to be mandatory 40-year
sentences for killing two officers _ would be paroled before
Christmas.
	   O'Donoghue said he'd spoken earlier by phone with relatives of
the dead. But some of those relatives accused him of being
insincere.
	   The releases come under terms of April's peace accord for
Northern Ireland, which called for all imprisoned members of
truce-observing paramilitary groups to be freed by mid-2000.
	   But representatives of the state's largely unarmed police force,
the Garda Siochana, said the four men convicted of killing two
members in 1979 and 1984 should have been excluded from parole.
	   Before calling its cease-fire in July 1997, the IRA killed
nearly 300 police in British-ruled Northern Ireland, but only three
in the Irish Republic, where the outlawed group stages robberies
regularly but tries to avoid courting public hostility.
	   Peter Rogers was convicted of fatally shooting policeman Seamus
Quaid in 1979, when the policeman stopped his van packed with
bomb-making material.
	   Patrick McPhillips, Thomas Eccles and Brian McShane were
convicted of killing Frank Hand in 1984, when the policeman was
guarding a shipment of cash.
	   ``These prisoners should be the last to get out. We thought
killing a garda (police officer) was as grave an offense as you
could get,'' said Quaid's sister, Angela Sheehan, who called the
justice minister's phoned explanation insensitive.
	   Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, responding to the criticism, said
his government must ``be sensitive to the feelings of the relatives
of victims,'' but was obliged to free the men in the wider
interests of peace.
	   Four other men are still awaiting trial on charges of killing
policeman Jeremiah McCabe in 1996 during a botched raid on a
cash-filled armored car. They, too, would be eligible for parole by
mid-2000 if convicted.

U.S. warns Libya of more sanctions if suspects not handed over

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with United States warning Libya that time
is running out, threatening further measures; Adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; With Britain-Lockerbie Anniversary &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Warning Libya that American patience is
running out, the United States said Monday it will seek further
sanctions against Tripoli in February unless two suspects in the
crash of Pan Am Flight 103 are handed over for trial.
	   On the 10th anniversary of the bombing, Britain echoed the
warning, saying it will ask the Security Council to look at further
measures when it holds its scheduled review of Libyan sanctions in
February.
	   ``It is the view of the U.S. government that our patience cannot
continue indefinitely on this subject,'' Deputy U.S. Ambassador
Peter Burleigh said. ``The world community cannot wait forever for
the Libyan authorities to come to a conclusion about this.''
	   British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock called on Libya to fulfill
its obligations under council resolutions and hand over the two
Libyan suspects indicted in connection with the Dec. 21, 1988
bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland which killed 270 people.
	   ``That would be the most fitting memorial to those victims who
we remember today,'' Greenstock said, noting that the bombing was
``the worst terrorist crime in British history.''
	   Last week, Libya's parliament gave its conditional approval for
the trial of the two suspects in the Netherlands, but said some
obstacles must still be overcome before the men are handed over.
	   The United States and Britain stressed Monday that their
governments have provided clarifications sought by Libya through
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and his legal adviser.
	   While Washington welcomes reports that Libya is moving to accept
the offer, Burleigh noted that in recent weeks the Libyans have
also produced ``new conditions for compliance.''
	   In August, the Security Council adopted a resolution supporting
the Anglo-American initiative to try the two Libyans before a
Scottish court in the Netherlands and pledged to suspend sanctions
as soon as they arrived for trial.
	   The sanctions included a ban on air travel from and to Libya,
restricting diplomatic personnel and banning the purchase of oil
equipment.
	   The Security Council made clear that if the two Libyans were not
handed over promptly, it would consider further sanctions _ and the
United States and Britain on Monday set a deadline of February's
sanctions review.
	   ``If by that time, the government of Libya has not handed over
the suspects for trial ... we will seek additional measures to
compel compliance,'' Burleigh said. ``We will not tolerate the
Libyan regime's continued defiance of the international community.
Ten years is much too long to wait for justice.''
	   Annan, who met with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi earlier this
month to discuss a possible handover of the suspects, said Monday
he remains hopeful of ``a positive decision'' from the Libyan
government _ and told relatives of the victims not to give up hope.
	   ``I had hoped it would come before this date, the anniversary,
but I have not lost hope and they (the relatives) should not,''
Annan said. ``It's regrettable that 10 years after the event we
have not been able to get to the truth so that they can put this
behind them, mourn their dead and carry on with their lives.''

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The speaker of Sudan's Parliament on
Monday formally submitted his resignation to lawmakers as part of a
political shuffle that is not expected to reduce his role as the
most influential person in the government.
	   Hassan Turabi's resignation must now be approved by President
Omar el-Bashir, but that also is considered a formality.
	   ``I am announcing to you my resignation as speaker of
Parliament. I will remain amongst you as a member, leaving this
seat for someone else,'' Turabi said in a speech in the National
Assembly, or Parliament.
	   Egypt's Middle East News Agency said the 400-seat National
Assembly accepted the resignation. But the official Sudan News
Agency later said a group of lawmakers decided to renominate Turabi
on Tuesday when a new speaker is expected to be elected.
	   Turabi had announced his resignation on Dec. 2 to work full time
for the governing National Congress party, whose monopoly on
politics will end next year under a law passed Dec. 9.
	   The Political Associations Law, which comes into effect Jan. 1,
allows the formation of political groups that may contest
elections.
	   El-Bashir, who banned all political parties after seizing power
in a 1989 military coup, said recently that the door was open for
opposition figures in exile to come back and form political
associations.
	   But the presence of the hard-line Turabi at the head of
Parliament had cast doubts on the seriousness of the government's
willingness to allow the opposition to flourish. Political analysts
interpreted Turabi's resignation as a government attempt to ease
those fears.
	   However, there is still some apprehension because the new law
only speaks of ``political associations.'' Turabi was strongly
opposed to some Parliament members' demand for a clear-cut
reference to ``political parties.''

Nerve finding helps explain why emotional memories endure

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Why do you remember your high school graduation
so well when you don't have a clue to what you did two days later?
	   In part, a study says, you can thank a nerve that runs to your
brain from deep in your innards.
	   Researchers found that stimulating this nerve in people improves
memory. They say the finding might someday help victims of stroke
or head injury recover faster.
	   The work helps explain why people remember emotionally charged
events _ weddings, deaths, insults _ better than ordinary
happenings.
	   Scientists already know that part of the story is the body's
response to emotional arousal: The body releases adrenaline and
other hormones into the blood. But for the most part, those
hormones can't get into the brain. So how could they influence
memory?
	   The new work points to the vagus (pronounced VAY-gus) nerve,
which extends from the brainstem to most of the body's internal
organs.
	   The vagus nerve is kind of a two-way street. It relays orders
from the brain to regulate things like heart rate, while keeping
the brain informed about what's going on in the organs, such as
whether the stomach is full.
	   Studies in rats have suggested the arousal hormones use the
vagus nerve to tell the brain it should hang on to particular
memories. Now, psychologist Robert A. Jensen of Southern Illinois
University in Carbondale and colleagues report evidence in humans
that the vagus nerve helps make some memories stick.
	   The work appears in the January issue of the journal Nature
Neuroscience.
	   ``This is exciting new information that provides an important
piece of the puzzle'' of how the hormones affect memory, said James
McGaugh, director of the Center for the Neurobiology of Learning
and Memory at the University of California at Irvine.
	   The researchers looked at 10 people involved in a medical study
that was aimed at seeing if an implanted device that stimulates the
vagus nerve could suppress epileptic seizures. The device was
approved for that use by federal regulators last year. Its maker,
Cyberonics Inc., provided some support for the memory study.
	   Participants were tested before and after they got the nerve
stimulators implanted. At each session, they read a series of
paragraphs that included a total of 42 words highlighted with a
yellow marker. In tests after implantation, the vagus nerve was
stimulated soon after they read individual paragraphs.
	   A short time later, they were tested on whether they could
recognize the target words in a list of about 250 words. They
scored about 36 percent better on recognizing words they'd read
just before nerve stimulation, compared with their performance
before getting the implant.
	   Since the stimulation occurred after the words were read, it
shows the nerve helps the brain store the memory of something that
just happened, rather than alerting the brain to pay attention to
what's coming up.
	   McGaugh said emotional arousal affects memory routinely, not
just during extremely emotional events. Day to day, it's a way to
help the brain separate the wheat from the chaff of life: If
something important has just happened, the body gets aroused enough
to cue the brain to remember it, he said.
	   Scientists have begun studies in rats to see if stimulating the
vagus nerve could speed up recovery after stroke or other brain
damage.
	   Jensen doubts that nerve stimulation could help people with
Alzheimer's disease or students cramming for tests.
	   His study found that too much nerve stimulation wipes out the
benefit on memory. When cramming, ``your level of arousal is
already up at optimum,'' he said. Stimulating the nerve even more
might actually make it harder for a student to remember the
lessons, he said.

 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with Clinton speech at Pan Am 103 ceremony; EDITS to
conform, tighten. &QL; 
 &UR; By SONYA ROSS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ President Bill Clinton promised the families
of the Pan Am 103 victims Monday that the United States will keep
pressure on Libya to turn over the suspects in the bombing. ``We
owe this not only to you, but to all Americans who seek justice,''
he said.
	   Speaking in Arlington National Cemetery at a memorial service on
the bombing's 10th anniversary, Clinton said the deal brokered by
the United States and Britain for trying the bombing suspects in a
neutral third country is ``a take it or leave it offer,'' and
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi would feel repercussions if he
continues to balk at the deal's conditions.
	   ``This was deliberate murder,'' Clinton said. ``None of us wants
to live in a world where such violence goes unpunished and people
can kill with impunity.''
	   Immediately, a man in the crowd shouted: ``Bomb Gadhafi, Mr.
President, please bomb Gadhafi.''
	   The 1988 bombing of the Pan American World Airways jumbo jet
over Lockerbie, Scotland killed 270 people.
	   The suspects are two Libyan intelligence agents, Abdel Basset
Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah. The United States and
Britain want to try them in the Netherlands under Scottish law, but
Gadhafi has refused to hand them over without a guarantee the men
will serve any sentence in Libya.
	   ``Our policy is not to trust Mr. Gadhafi's claims, it is to test
them,'' Clinton said. ``If the suspects are not turned over, we
will work at the United Nations with our allies and friends to seek
even stronger measures against Libya. If the proposal fails, all
should make sure the responsibility falls on Mr. Gadhafi alone.''
	   To the families, Clinton said: ``Although 10 years, or 20 or 30
or 50, may never be long enough for the sorrow to fade, we pray
that it may not be too long now before the wait for justice and
resolution is over.''
	   After he spoke, Clinton joined Hillary Rodham Clinton and family
members in laying roses on the meorial cairn erected in memory of
the 270 victims, as the sun began to peek through a steel-grey sky.
	   The service reflected the compassionate, remorseful stance
Clinton has assumed after becoming the first president in 130 years
to be impeached. Earlier Monday, Clinton had only kind words for
members of Congress as he ladled spaghetti sauce over a pan of
lasagna at the D.C. Central Kitchen.
	   ``I hope they have a merry Christmas,'' Clinton said. ``I hope
everyone in the country will take some time to think about other
people and do something in the spirit of the season _ something
like this.''
	   Mrs. Clinton worked beside her husband to prepare lunch for the
hungry.
	   Later in the week, the embattled president will gather children
around him in the White House's East Room and read holiday stories
to them before settling in for a quiet Christmas at home.
	   White House spokesman Barry Toiv said Sunday that Clinton's
activities were in keeping with his commitment to community
service. ``And of course, it's for the holiday season,'' Toiv
added.
	   But between the events lies a strategy to pull Clinton's
presidency out of the ashes by the time the Senate opens an
impeachment trial early next year. In the next two weeks, White
House aides plan to seize on the lull in Congress and provide
Clinton with forums to talk about his pet legislative topics _
health care, education and Social Security.
	   Aides hoped the images of Clinton being compassionate while
advocating popular social programs would help boost public support.
An NBC poll conducted after Saturday's impeachment votes in the
House found 72 percent of respondents approved of the way he
handles the presidency, and aides were aiming to push the
popularity ratings even higher by the time the Senate convenes his
trial.
	   Clinton laid the foundation for this strategy Saturday just
after the House passed two articles of impeachment against him.
Dismissing Republican calls for him to resign, Clinton said he will
serve ``until the last hour of the last day'' of his term in
January 2000, and he appealed for an end to ``the politics of
personal destruction.''
	   While Clinton is out displaying leadership, White House chief of
staff John Podesta said, his aides will put a full press on the
Senate to come up with an alternative to an impeachment trial and a
vote on removing the president from office.

	   Slumped in his seat at the Knesset head table, Netanyahu cast a
vote for the elections bill moved by the opposition Labor Party.
	   He had likely played the final card in his two-month struggle to
keep his government afloat after he returned from Wye River,
Maryland, with a new peace agreement with the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu's coalition started shedding hard-liners opposed to
further concessions. He sought _ and received _ tacit support from
the Labor Party in order to sustain the agreement.
	   But he lost Labor when he froze Wye last month, after accusing
the Palestinians of sabotaging the accords.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After rejecting Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's peace policies, Israel's parliament on Monday approved
the initial reading of a bill to call early elections.
	   The elections bill, which Netanyahu says he will not try to
block, came after the prime minister's fruitless, last-minute
appeal to the opposition Labor Party to negotiate a national unity
government.

Troubled probe of Mounties' protest crackdown gets new leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ A retired judge was appointed Monday to take over
a troubled inquiry into whether police acted improperly when they
suppressed protesters during a 1997 Asia-Pacific summit meeting.
	   Ted Hughes will take the place of a three-member inquiry panel
that resigned because of confusion and controversy over allegations
of bias and interference.
	   The inquiry was launched by the Public Complaints Commission of
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police after student protesters
complained that their rights had been violated by officers during
the 1997 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Vancouver.
	   Police used pepper spray to disperse students protesting the
presence of Indonesian President Suharto. Some female protesters
were also strip searched.
	   Protesters subsequently contended that orders to break up the
demonstrations came from the office of Prime Minister Jean Chretien
because he wanted to spare Suharto embarrassment.
	   Opposition parties and many of the protesters say the police
complaints commission doesn't have the authority to deal with the
issue of political interference. They have demanded a judicial
inquiry into the affair, but Chretien has rejected those appeals
and insists he did not intervene in police matters during the APEC
summit.
	   Hughes is scheduled to start hearings in January that will
include repeat appearances from witnesses who testified during five
sessions conducted by the now-disbanded panel.

	   LOCKERBIE, Scotland (AP) _ With the mournful lament of bagpipes
and prayers of healing, the people of Lockerbie paid tribute to the
270 people killed when a bomb brought Pan Am Flight 103 crashing
down on this tiny town 10 years ago Monday.
	   The hundreds who packed Dryfesdale Parish Church heard messages
from British Prime Minister Tony Blair and U.S. President Bill
Clinton, who renewed their vows to punish the culprits who hid the
bomb in a suitcase on Dec. 21, 1988.
	   But they also heard quiet sobs that echoed throughout the
century-old church as a few moments of silence were observed before
the bagpiper blew her lament.
	   ``In the lives that were lost, some very young, there was
meaning and achievement,'' the Rev. David Almond told the gathering
of about 600 people, which included 60 family members of those who
perished. ``Our task in commemoration is to continue that meaning
and to build on that achievement.''
	   The congregation heard the children of the local elementary
school sing a tribute, ``Let There be Love,'' as well as a message
from the queen.
	   ``We pray on this anniversary that the families will find solace
together in quiet remembrance across the world,'' the queen's
message said.
	   In a separate service in London's Westminster Abbey, attended by
Blair, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and Prince Andrew, the second
son of Queen Elizabeth II, hundreds listened as one-by-one the
names of the 259 passengers and 11 of Lockerbie's own residents
were read out as a candle was lit for each.
	   Simultaneous services were also held at Arlington National
Cemetery in Virginia and in Syracuse, New York, which lost 35
college students in the crash. Each service began at 7:03 p.m.
(1903 GMT), the moment when the plane disappeared from the radar
screen above Scotland.
	   ``This was a very positive, emotional day,'' Bert Ammerman of
River Vale, New Jersey, whose brother Thomas died in the crash,
said after the service. He said the people of Lockerbie have
``proven over the past 10 years that good intentions can overcome
evil.''
	   Earlier in the day, Prince Philip, the queen's husband, laid a
wreath in Lockerbie's cemetery, where the town's Roman Catholic
parish priest at the time of the crash spoke to about 200 victims'
relatives and townspeople about the ``ticking bomb'' of justice.
	   ``Ten years ago, for you and for us, a bomb was ticking,'' the
Rev. Pat Keegans told the crowd, many of them visibly moved. ``Be
assured of this _ there is another bomb ticking _ the irresistible
bomb of justice and truth.
	   ``Be certain that our wreath-laying today is not a symbolic
gesture. It is a declaration that we will not rest until we have
justice and truth, until all who are responsible for your deaths
are held accountable,'' he said.
	   Two Libyan suspects have been indicted in connection with the
bombing, but have not yet been turned over for trial. Last week,
Libya's Parliament gave its conditional approval for a trial in the
Netherlands by a Scottish court, but said some obstacles remained.
	   The plane had just reached its cruising altitude of 31,000 feet
(9,400 kms), 42 minutes after taking off from London's Heathrow
Airport for New York, when it exploded in the night sky.
	   The aircraft was felled by a small amount of high explosives
smuggled on in a portable radio hidden inside a suitcase, which
made its way as checked baggage from Malta to Frankfurt, Germany,
and then to London.

renouncement of Palestinian demands for the release of jailed
killers; a gathering up of illegal arms; and an end to anti-Israel
attacks by Palestinians.
	   ``The way to reach true peace is to maintain demands that
Palestinians carry out their obligations, that way we will protect
peace, security and Jerusalem,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Opposition leader Ehud Barak said the paralysis of the Netanyahu
government was endangering the country.

at the expense of education, of employment, of true security for

Azerbaijan protests Russia-Armenia fighter plane pact
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ Azerbaijan urged Russia on Monday to
drop a deal to supply Armenia with warplanes and beef up military
posts in the Caucasus Mountains nation.
	   Russia and Armenia signed a deal recently on military
cooperation, which Azerbaijan's Foreign Ministry called a threat to
stability in the region.
	   The ministry said in a statement Monday that the deal
contradicts efforts to settle the dispute over the enclave of
Nagorno-Karabakh, which is inside Azerbaijan but is populated
mainly by Armenians.
	   Armenia and Azerbaijan fought a six-year war for the region that
killed 25,000 people. Russian, U.S. and French mediators are trying
to help the two countries resolve the dispute.
	   The military agreement was reached during a recent visit to
Armenia by the commander of the Russian air force, Anatoly
Kornukov, the ministry statement said. The deal calls for supplies
of Russian MiG-29 fighters and strengthening Russian military
presence in Armenia.
	   Russian military have remained there since the 1991 Soviet
collapse under an agreement with Armenian officials. Azerbaijan has
long protested the close Russian-Armenian relations.

Palestinians carry out their obligations. That way we will protect
peace, security and Jerusalem,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Opposition leader Ehud Barak said the paralysis of the Netanyahu
government was endangering the country.
	   ``This government divided Israel and gave into the extremists _
at the expense of education, of employment, of true security for
all,'' he said.

Iraq: U.S. bombing destroyed missile plants, killed 62 soldiers

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.S. and British airstrikes killed 62
soldiers, demolished key Iraqi factories used to produce missile
parts and severed phone lines between the north and south, Iraqi
officials said Monday.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said civilian casualties were
``much, much higher,'' but refused to give details. Iraq earlier
said that 42 people were killed in the four nights of airstrikes.
	   The attacks targeted key military bases, government buildings,
communication centers and factories that could be used to
manufacture weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq says the missiles also struck colleges, post offices,
dormitories, a museum and an oil refinery.
	   ``They want to ... strip Iraq of any serious industrial
capabilities,'' Aziz said. ``This is a policy of hatred.''
	   But he added that the United States and Britain failed to
seriously harm the Iraqi government or military.
	   ``They boasted of great success ... They lied,'' Aziz said at a
news conference in Baghdad.
	   The Republican Guard, the country's elite fighting force and a
main target of the attacks, lost 20 soldiers, he said.
	   Eighteen soldiers of the Special Republican Guard and 24
soldiers in other branches of the military were also killed, he
said. A total of 180 soldiers were injured, he said.
	   But most of the strikes hit empty barracks, Aziz said, adding
that ``these barracks could be and will be rebuilt.'
	   In London, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the airstrikes
have set back parts of Iraq's ``military infrastructure several
years.''
	   A spokesman for Blair, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the targets included 20 command and control facilities and nine
sites linked to the Republican Guard.
	   Aziz confirmed Monday that the strikes, which devastated
telephone centers in the southern city of Basra, has severely
disrupted communication between the largely Shiite Muslim south and
the predominantly Sunni Muslim north of the country.
	   The south rose in rebellion following the 1991 Gulf War. The
uprising was crushed by troops loyal to Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.
	   Aziz dismissed claims that the recent attacks could lead to
another rebellion.
	   ``They thought, foolishly, that when they sent a few hundred
missiles against Iraq that the people of Iraq would rise up against
their leadership,'' he said. ``This is fantasy.''
	   The attacks heavily damaged factories that could be used to
produce weapons of mass destruction or long-range missiles.
	   Those sites included the al-Nasser factory in Taji, 60
kilometers (40 miles) north of Baghdad and the al-Nida factory,
south of the capital, Iraqi officials said.
	   Both factories produced short-range missiles that are not banned
by U.N. resolutions.
	   U.N. weapons monitors closely monitor both factories to ensure
that they are not used to build components for rockets with ranges
beyond 150 kilometers (90 miles).
	   Iraqi officials said that the speed of the attacks took them by
surprise and workers did not have enough time to remove crucial
equipment before the factories were attacked. The officials spoke
on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The United States and Britain began the attacks shortly after
chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler accused Iraq of failing
to fully cooperate with the inspectors.
	   Al-Nasser was heavily bombed during the 1991 Gulf War but
workers had removed most of the high-tech lathes before the
attacks.
	   The U.N. weapons monitors had 12 remote-control monitoring
cameras at al-Nasser.
	   The U.N. weapons teams are responsible for dismantling Iraq's
programs to build chemical, biological or nuclear weapons and
missiles with ranges in excess of 150 kilometers (90 miles).
	   Aziz said that Baghdad will not allow the monitors to return.
	   ``The weapons inspectors were killed by the American missiles,''
he said. ``I cannot give them another life.''
	   He added that the United States and Britain must be condemned
and held accountable for the attack and U.N. sanctions must be
lifted.
	   ``Without that, it would be difficult for Iraq to talk,'' he
said.
	   The sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
Security Council diplomats have said that they will not be lifted
until Iraq fully cooperates with U.N. weapons inspectors.

Balloon team nears China, still hoping for permission to cross
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMS &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Three men hoping to be the first to circle the
world by balloon neared China early Friday, still hoping for
permission to fly on a northerly course but fearing that they may
be ordered to abandon their quest.
	   ``We are effectively in an emergency situation,'' said British
tycoon Richard Branson, who has teamed with American Steve Fossett
and Sweden's Per Linstrand.
	   ``But we are friends with the Chinese people, and this is a
sporting event, an adventure. We have no choice but to go over
China, and we would be enormously grateful if they let us in,''
Branson said Thursday.
	   China had given permission for the ICO Global balloon to travel
in its airspace south of 26 degrees north latitude. But because of
diversions around Mediterranean storms and Iraq, the balloon
crossed the Himalayas further north than planned.
	   Because of the rugged Himalayan terrain, the balloon had no
place to land before reaching China, project director Mike Kendrick
said.
	   ``The Chinese are very friendly. I've apologized to them,''
Kendrick said. ``It is their airspace. They are entitled to keep us
out. I have no argument with that at all, but we are appealing to
them.''
	   Britain's Foreign Office, which was in touch with Chinese
officials in an effort to get permission for the flight, advised
the balloonists that they must follow any orders from China once
they are over its territory.
	   At the same time diplomats were seeking Chinese help for the
balloonists, a senior official, Foreign Office Minister Derek
Fatchett, was criticizing China for the 13 year prison sentence
given to dissident Xu Wenli on Monday.
	   ``I was shocked to learn today at the speed with which Mr. Xu
Wenli was tried, and the severity of his sentence,'' Fatchett said.
	   The balloonists also had a problem before crossing Libya, when
permission was unexpectedly revoked. That was resolved on Saturday
just before the balloon entered Libyan airspace.
	   The 270-foot (82-meter) balloon reached the Himalayas after a
quiet day Sunday crossing Turkmenistan in Central Asia and flying
over Afghanistan.
	   Over the weekend, the team had faced fierce thunderstorms and
was forced to follow a narrow corridor in the Caucasus to avoid
flying over Iraq, Iran and Russia, which had denied permission to
use their airspace.
	   Branson and Lindstrand have already beaten their personal best
of 48 hours in a hot air balloon during a 1991 crossing of the
Pacific.
	   Fossett has made four tries to ring the globe. On the last, he
was lucky to survive when his balloon tore in a thunderstorm, after
traveling 15,000 miles (24,000 kms).
	   Branson has tried, and failed, four times to become the first to
circle the world non-stop in a balloon.
	   Improved technology has been used to make this balloon,
including a canopy of Kevlar of the kind used for bulletproof
vests.
	   The crew members estimate the trip could last from eight days to
nearly three weeks. They hope to touch down somewhere in western
Europe at the end of a 24,000-mile (38,000 kms) flight, which will
take them over India, the South China sea, the Pacific and the
United States.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and initially had only four refusals _ Iran, Iraq, Russia and North
Korea.
	   At least three other crews have been waiting for favorable
weather to launch balloons _ from Albuquerque, New Mexico, Loves
Park, Illinois, and the Swiss Alps. Yet another team plans to take
off next month from Alice Springs, Australia.

'Singing postcards' keep islands' Christmas tradition alive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT HOFFMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ This time of year, the ``singing
postcards'' are on nearly every street corner, determined to carry
on a Christmas tradition even if hardly anyone understands a word
of the songs.
	   They are parang bands, a cultural phenomenon in the Caribbean
country of Trinidad and Tobago. They begin popping up in November
and disappear by early January, but with Christmas just days away,
the singing groups are hitting their peak.
	   Imported from nearby Venezuela, the music has a lively,
decidedly Latin beat. ``Parang'' is a mispronunciation of
``parranda,'' the Spanish word for ``spree.''
	   One theory holds that Spanish missionaries began the tradition
while trying to teach the natives the Christmas story through song.
Another claims that Venezuelans who came to Trinidad to work the
coffee and cocoa plantations brought the songs.
	   ``But both _ or neither _ might be true,'' said Gail Ganpat of
the parang group Los Buenos Parranderos.
	   In this English-speaking country populated mostly by descendants
of African slaves and East Indian immigrants, what makes parang's
popularity all the more surprising is that the lyrics are in
Spanish.
	   Traditionally, the language of parang was a creole patois or
even pseudo-Spanish created as Trinidadians mimicked the sounds of
Venezuelan workers, Ganpat said. The trend now is a return to
linguistically correct Spanish.
	   The tradition took root during the Spanish occupation of the
island from the early 1500s to the British takeover at the end of
the 18th century, when itinerant groups of men and their
guitar-like cuatros went from farm to farm like carolers singing
Christmas songs.
	   The singers would get a taste or two of rum from the locals in
appreciation and move on to the next house or farm.
	   The once-rural tradition has gone nationwide.
	   ``Now it has come to the cities,'' said Cynthia Ross, president
of the National Parang Association.
	   Parang seems to be everywhere. There are concerts, festivals and
contests that often last all night.
	   During competitions, bands are given two topics that they must
sing about _ themes such as the manger scene, the streets of
Bethlehem, or the journey of Joseph and Mary.
	   Today the institution of parang has given rise to such
variations as the use of electrified instruments, women singers and
even a genre of music know as ``soca-parang,'' a calypso twist on
the old recipe.
	   In some cases, the songs are now sung in English. ``Gimme rum,
gimme whiskey, gimme something to eat, and we will sing you our
Christmas songs,'' goes one.
	   But part of the Parang Association's mission is to stick to the
age-old lyrics, which Trinidadians still applaud even when they
don't understand a word.

Government survives vote of no-confidence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The reformist center-right government
on Monday survived a vote of no-confidence sought by leftists and
nationalists who accused it of ruining the economy.
	   Prime Minister Radu Vasile's government was supported by 283
votes and 163 legislators voted against, national radio station
reported.
	   There are 486 legislators in the two-chamber parliament.
	   Vasile criticized the opposition, comprising the leftist Social
Democracy Party and the nationalist National Unity and Greater
Romania parties, for their move which he claimed was politically
motivated.
	   ``The longer reforms are delayed, the more painful are economic
solutions,'' said Vasile before a joint sitting.
	   Vasile said the government is committed to continue its reforms
by privatizing and closing the money-losing companies.
	   He said his government will have the support of the
International Monetary Fund which said it would lend money to the
government to help the unemployed if it closes down bankrupted
companies.
	   Vasile blamed the opposition, which ran the country from 1990 to
1996, for delaying privatization. He said the government was now
forced to sell state assets at a ``very reduced price.''
	   Some 143 lawmakers supported a motion blaming the government for
chaos in the economy and a serious drop in living standards.
	   ``Romanians have become poorer and poorer, and government
reforms ... are mostly a mockery,'' said Valeriu Tabara, leader of
the National Unity Party.
	   In Nov. 1996, the newly elected government launched an ambitious
but painful economic reform program to privatize the state sector
and introduce a tight fiscal policy.
	   Since then, purchasing power and production have dropped
sharply. While unemployment has risen to over 9 percent, the
average monthly salary has dropped to about 1.2 million lei (dlrs
120).
	   The government recently said that some 170,000 people lost their
jobs this year and 70,000 other jobs would be cut over the upcoming
weeks, as 29 state money-losing companies are closed.
	   This was the third no confidence vote brought against the
government in the last two years. It also easily survived the first
two.

	   Just before the vote on peace policies, Netanyahu approached the
Knesset podium and launched into an appeal for a national unity
government.
	   It was an about-face for Netanyahu, who had counted out such
appeals from members in his coalition. Now he appealed for unity.
	   He suggested a time-out of 72 hours to negotiate national unity.
	   ``We will investigate possiblity to come together ... if we dont
succeed at least we tried at this critical moment for Israel.''
	   Barak refused.
	   ``It's a little too late,'' Barak said, adding that he doubted
the sincerity of the offer.
	   The Knesset's spectators' gallery was packed with dignitaries as
the political drama got under way. A sticker posted in the
parliament's halls read, ``Come on, Sara, let's go home'' _
referring to Netanyahu's wife.
	   The hours before the session's start were filled with with
last-minute political dealmaking. Confused Knesset members wandered
in and out of the wood-and-stone plenum chamber, asking journalists
if they knew what agenda had been settled on.
	   Netanyahu's handling of the peace process has drawn fire from
all sides in the two months since the signing of the U.S.-brokered
accords.
	   The Israeli left accuses Netanyahu of bad faith and
foot-dragging, saying the prime minister never intended to live up
to promises made under the landmark Oslo accords signed by slain
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   Since Netanyahu took office in May 1996, the peace process has
been largely stalled. The signing of the Wye accords on Oct. 23 in
Washington represented a dramatic break in what had been a 19-month
deadlock.
	   The accord's right-wing opponents, among them Jewish settlers,
have expressed fury at Netanyahu for agreeing to hand over more
West Bank land to the Palestinians in exchange for security steps.
Previously, he had promised to fight any such concessions.
	   The Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's new demands and denounced
the delays as unfair and potentially dangerous.
	   ``If Wye is not carried forward, the situation in the coming few
weeks will be negative,'' said Marwan Bargouti, leader of Yasser
Arafat's Fatah faction. He said violent clashes could result.
	   One prime potential opponent is Lt. Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak,
who has been on leave since stepping down as army chief of staff in
July. He is now expected to announce his retirement from the
military.
	   Little is known of Shahak's policies. As a soldier, he is
prohibited from expressing an opinion, but his deep involvement in
the peace talks suggests he is a moderate who favors territorial
concessions.
	   Polls have suggested that a centrist bid by Shahak would likely
push Barak out of the race in the first round of voting and lead to
a run-off between Netanyahu and Shahak.
	   As Monday's session began, legislators gave preliminary approval
to a measure that would end direct elections for the prime
minister. However, it would not apply to upcoming elections.

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The speaker of Sudan's Parliament
formally submitted his resignation to lawmakers Monday. The move
was part of a political shuffle that is not expected to reduce his
role as the most influential person in the government.
	   Hassan Turabi's resignation must now be approved by President
Omar el-Bashir, which is considered a formality.
	   ``I am announcing to you my resignation as speaker of
Parliament. I will remain amongst you as a member, leaving this
seat for someone else,'' Turabi said in a speech in the National
Assembly.
	   Egypt's Middle East News Agency said the 400-seat National
Assembly accepted the resignation. But the official Sudan News
Agency later said a group of lawmakers decided to renominate Turabi
on Tuesday when a new speaker is expected to be elected.
	   Turabi had announced his resignation on Dec. 2 to work full time
for the governing National Congress party, whose monopoly on
politics ends on Jan. 1
	   The Political Associations Law, passed on Dec. 9, allows the
formation of political groups that may contest elections.
	   El-Bashir, who banned all political parties after seizing power
in a 1989 military coup, said recently that the door was open for
opposition figures in exile to come back and form political
associations.
	   But the presence of the hard-line Turabi at the head of
Parliament had cast doubts on the government's willingness to allow
the opposition to flourish. Political analysts interpreted Turabi's
resignation as a government attempt to ease those fears.
	   However, there is still some apprehension because the new law
only speaks of ``political associations.'' Turabi opposed some
Parliament members' demand for a clear-cut reference to ``political
parties.''

	   LOCKERBIE, Scotland (AP) _ With the mournful lament of bagpipes
and prayers of healing, the people of Lockerbie paid tribute to the
270 people killed when a bomb brought Pan Am Flight 103 crashing
down on this tiny town 10 years ago Monday.
	   The hundreds who packed Dryfesdale Parish Church heard messages
from British Prime Minister Tony Blair and U.S. President Bill
Clinton, who renewed their vows to punish the culprits who hid the
bomb in a suitcase on Dec. 21, 1988.
	   But they also heard quiet sobs that echoed throughout the
century-old church as a few moments of silence were observed before
the bagpiper blew her lament.
	   ``In the lives that were lost, some very young, there was
meaning and achievement,'' the Rev. David Almond told the gathering
of about 600 people, which included 60 family members of those who
perished. ``Our task in commemoration is to continue that meaning
and to build on that achievement.''
	   The congregation heard the children of the local elementary
school sing a tribute, ``Let There be Love,'' as well as a message
from the queen.
	   ``We pray on this anniversary that the families will find solace
together in quiet remembrance across the world,'' the queen's
message said.
	   In a separate service in London's Westminster Abbey, attended by
Blair, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and Prince Andrew, the second
son of Queen Elizabeth II, hundreds listened as one-by-one the
names of the 259 passengers and crew and 11 of Lockerbie's own
residents were read out as a candle was lit for each.

	   Just before the vote on peace policies, Netanyahu approached the
Knesset podium and launched an appeal for a national unity
government with the main opposition Labor Party.
	   It was an about-face for Netanyahu, who had counted out such
appeals from members in his coalition.
	   He suggested a time-out of 72 hours to negotiate such a
coalition.
	   ``We will investigate the possibility of coming together ... if
we don't succeed at least we tried at this critical moment for
Israel.''
	   Barak refused.
	   ``It's a little too late,'' Barak said, adding that he doubted
the sincerity of the offer.
	   The Knesset's spectators' gallery was packed with dignitaries as
the political drama got underway. A sticker posted in the
parliament's halls read, ``Come on, Sara, let's go home'' _
referring to Netanyahu's wife.
	   The hours before the session's start were filled with
last-minute political dealmaking. Confused Knesset members wandered
in and out of the wood-and-stone chamber, asking journalists if
they knew what agenda had been settled on.
	   Netanyahu's handling of the peace process has drawn fire from
all sides in the two months since the signing of the U.S.-brokered
accords.
	   The Israeli left accuses Netanyahu of bad faith and
foot-dragging, saying the prime minister never intended to live up
to promises made under the landmark Oslo accords signed by slain
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   Since Netanyahu took office in May 1996, the peace process has
been largely stalled. The signing of the Wye accords on Oct. 23 in
Washington represented a dramatic break in what had been a 19-month
deadlock.
	   The accord's right-wing opponents, among them Jewish settlers,
have expressed fury at Netanyahu for agreeing to hand over more
West Bank land to the Palestinians in exchange for security steps.
Previously, he had promised to fight any such concessions.
	   The Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's new demands and denounced
the delays as unfair and potentially dangerous.
	   ``If Wye is not carried forward, the situation in the coming few
weeks will be negative,'' said Marwan Bargouti, leader of Yasser
Arafat's Fatah faction. He said violent clashes could result.
	   One prime potential opponent is Lt. Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak,
who has been on leave since stepping down as army chief of staff in
July. He is now expected to announce his retirement from the
military.
	   Little is known of Shahak's policies. As a soldier, he is
prohibited from expressing an opinion, but his deep involvement in
the peace talks suggests he is a moderate who favors territorial
concessions.
	   Polls have suggested that a centrist bid by Shahak would likely
push Barak out of the race in the first round of voting and lead to
a run-off between Netanyahu and Shahak.
	   As Monday's session began, legislators gave preliminary approval
to a measure that would end direct elections for the prime
minister. However, it would not apply to upcoming elections.

Turkish premier-designate fails to form a new government

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ President Suleyman Demirel appeared likely
to turn to some widely trusted lawmaker to form Turkey's next
government, after a veteran politician abandoned efforts Monday to
persuade bickering political leaders to support him in a
pro-secular coalition.
	   Bulent Ecevit of the Democratic Left Party failed in a
3-week-old attempt to form a government that could command a
majority of votes in Parliament.
	   ``It is now clear that no party leader can form a government
that can win a vote of confidence,'' former Premier Mesut Yilmaz
said after talks with Demirel. ``We have told the president that we
will not hamper the appointment of a deputy of Parliament.''
	   With party leaders unable to overcome differences, the new
premier-designate would most probably be affiliated to a party but
be trusted enough by other parties to follow an independent line.
	   Parliament Speaker Hikmet Cetin has been suggested as a likely
candidate.
	   The new appointment would be made within days, Yilmaz told
reporters.
	   Demirel consulted Turkey's party leaders immediately after
Ecevit gave up. Most declared themselves in favor of a government
led by a lawmaker. Only center-right leader Tansu Ciller said she
wanted a government led by a party leader, and made clear she was
willing to take on the task.
	   Turkey's parliament is split by longstanding animosity between
its center-left and center-right parties.
	   Yilmaz led the last government, which collapsed in November amid
allegations he had ties to organized crime and interfered with the
sale of a state bank.
	   By tradition, Demirel should then have asked the leader of
Parliament's largest party to form a new government. But Demirel
broke with custom to keep the Islamic-oriented Virtue Party from
power.
	   Turkey's staunchly secular military opposes the return of an
Islamic-led government. Modern Turkey has had only one Islamic-led
government, formed after 1995 elections, and the military pressured
it from power for failing to stick to the country's secular
traditions.
	   Ecevit refused even to consult with the leader of the Virtue
Party during his efforts to form a government.

	   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) _ President Miguel Angel Rodriguez
expressed frustration Monday at the escape from prison of an
Israeli-Panamanian citizen wanted on money laundering charges in
the United States.
	   ``I feel very ashamed by this. We look like fools,'' Rodriguez
told reporters at his office.
	   Josef Mordok escaped from a prison in San Jose on Wednesday,
after a man presented prison officials with false documents
supposedly ordering Mordok's release.
	   The U.S. government last week turned over documents to support
the extradition of Mordok, who is wanted on charges of laundering
some dlrs 100 million from drug trafficking.
	   Rodriguez said he worried that the case ``could affect
diplomatic relations'' with the United States.
	   He said judicial officials had not yet fully explained the
circumstances of the escape.

 &UR; Knesset votes to go to early elections

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's parliament gave its preliminary
approval to early elections on Monday, after rejecting Benjamin
Netanyahu's peace policies.
	   The vote _ which Netanyahu says he will not attempt to block in
two subsequent readings mandated by law _ came after a fruitless
last-minute appeal for a national unity government from the Israeli
prime minister.
	   Slumped in his seat at the Knesset head table, Netanyahu cast a
vote for the elections bill moved by the opposition Labor Party.
	   He had likely played the final card in his two-month struggle to
keep his government afloat after he returned from Wye River,
Maryland, with a new peace agreement with the Palestinians,
brokered by U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   Immediately after Wye, Netanyahu's coalition started shedding
hard-liners opposed to further concessions. He sought _ and
received _ tacit support from the Labor Party in order to sustain
the agreement.
	   But he lost Labor when he froze Wye last month, accusing the
Palestinians of sabotaging the accords.
	   Opposition leader Ehud Barak said the paralysis of the Netanyahu
government was endangering the country.
	   ``This government divided Israel and gave into the extremists _
at the expense of education, of employment, of true security for
all,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu's conditions for resuming the talks included: a
renouncement of Palestinian intentions to declare a state by May; a
renouncement of Palestinian demands for the release of jailed
killers; a gathering up of illegal arms; and an end to anti-Israel
attacks by Palestinians.
	   ``The way to reach true peace is to maintain demands that
Palestinians carry out their obligations, that way we will protect
peace, security and Jerusalem,'' Netanyahu said.
	   The Knesset rejected his peace policies 56 to 48, with two
abstentions.
	   Some straggling legislators returned to the chamber, and the
vote on elections was approved 81 to 30, with four abstentions.
	   Netanyahu had said earlier he would negotiate an elections date
with the opposition. Media reports said they could come any time
between the end of March and the beginning of June.
	   Just before the vote on peace policies, Netanyahu approached the
Knesset podium and launched into an appeal for a national unity
government.
	   Netanyahu, who until Monday had counted out all antional unity
appeals from members in his coalition. He suggested a time-out of

 &UR; Israeli parliament votes to go to early elections
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series; TRIMS; minor editing &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's parliament rejected Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's peace policies Monday, then gave initial
approval to a bill calling early elections
	   The election bill must be approved twice more, but Netanyahu has
said he will not attempt to block its passage. Early parliamentary
elections, which could come anytime in the next three to six
months, will mean yet another delay in the Mideast peace process.
	   The call for early elections followed Netanyahu's fruitless,
last-minute appeal to the opposition Labor Party to negotiate a
national unity government.
	   Slumped in his seat at the Knesset head table, Netanyahu cast a
vote for the elections bill that was put forward by Labor.
	   He had struggled to keep his government afloat in the two months
since returning from Wye River, Maryland, with a new
land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians, brokered by U.S.
President Bill Clinton.
	   Immediately after Wye, hard-liners opposed to further
concessions to the Palestinians started defecting from Netanyahu's
coalition. The prime minister then sought _ and received _ tacit
support from the Labor Party in order to sustain the peace
agreement.
	   But he lost Labor when he froze implementation of Israeli
commitments under Wye last month, accusing the Palestinians of
sabotaging the accord.
	   Labor leader Ehud Barak said the paralysis of the Netanyahu
government was endangering the country.
	   ``This government divided Israel and gave in to the extremists _
at the expense of education, of employment, of true security for
all,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu had presented his conditions that Palestinians must
meet for a resumption in talks: renounce their intentions to
declare a state by May; drop their demands for the release of
jailed killers; confiscate illegal arms; and ensure that
anti-Israel attacks are halted.
	   ``The way to reach true peace is to maintain demands that
Palestinians carry out their obligations. That way we will protect
peace, security and Jerusalem,'' Netanyahu said.
	   The Knesset rejected his peace policies 56 to 48, with two
abstentions.
	   Some absent legislators then returned to the chamber, and the
vote on elections was approved 81 to 30, with four abstentions.
	   Netanyahu had said earlier he would negotiate an elections date
with the opposition. Media reports said they could come any time
between the end of March and the beginning of June.
	   Just before the vote on peace policies, Netanyahu approached the
Knesset podium and launched into an appeal for a national unity
government.
	   Netanyahu, who until Monday had ruled out coalition partners'
appeals for a national unity government, suggested a time-out of 72
hours to negotiate such a broad-based coalition including Labor.
	   ``We will investigate the possibility of coming together ... if
we don't succeed at least we tried at this critical moment for
Israel,'' he said.
	   Barak refused.
	   ``It's a little too late,'' Barak said, adding that he doubted
the sincerity of the offer.
	   The Knesset's spectators' gallery was packed with dignitaries as
the political drama got underway. A sticker posted in the
parliament's halls read, ``Come on, Sara, let's go home'' _
referring to Netanyahu's wife.
	   The hours before the session's start were filled with
last-minute political dealmaking. Confused Knesset members wandered
in and out of the wood-and-stone chamber, asking journalists if
they knew what agenda had been settled on.
	   Netanyahu's handling of the peace process has drawn fire from
all sides in the two months since the signing of Wye.
	   The Israeli left accuses Netanyahu of bad faith and
foot-dragging, saying the prime minister never intended to live up
to promises made under the landmark Oslo accords signed by slain
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   Since Netanyahu took office in May 1996, the peace process has
been largely stalled. The signing of the Wye accords on Oct. 23 in
Washington represented a dramatic break in what had been a 19-month
deadlock.
	   The accord's right-wing opponents, among them Jewish settlers,
have expressed fury at Netanyahu for agreeing to hand over more
West Bank land to the Palestinians in exchange for security steps.
Previously, he had promised to fight any such concessions.
	   The Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's new demands and denounced
the delays as unfair and potentially dangerous.
	   ``If Wye is not carried forward, the situation in the coming few
weeks will be negative,'' said Marwan Bargouti, leader of Yasser
Arafat's Fatah faction. He said violent clashes could result.
	   One prime potential opponent is Lt. Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak,
who has been on leave since stepping down as army chief of staff in
July. He is now expected to announce his retirement from the
military.
	   Little is known of Shahak's policies. As a soldier, he is
prohibited from expressing an opinion, but his deep involvement in
the peace talks suggests he is a moderate who favors territorial
concessions.
	   Polls have suggested that a centrist bid by Shahak would likely
push Barak out of the race in the first round of voting and lead to
a run-off between Netanyahu and Shahak.

Iraq: Bombing destroyed missile factories, killed 62 soldiers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Syria denouncing airstrikes, trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.S. and British airstrikes demolished
Iraq's two main factories for producing parts for short-range
missiles permitted by the United Nations, Iraqi officials said
Monday.
	   The four nights of airstrikes also killed 62 soldiers and
injured 180 others, said Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz.
He said civilian casualties were ``much, much higher,'' but did not
give figures.
	   ``The serious damage was in civilian sites,'' Aziz said, calling
it ``the American way of war.'' Sites attacked included hospitals,
private homes and schools, he said.
	   Despite the four days of attacks, the United States had failed
to make any dent in the Iraqi military might, Aziz said.
	   ``They boasted of great success .... They lied,'' he said.
	   During the weekend, Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, had
said that thousands of people were killed or injured, but did not
substantiate that claim.
	   Iraqi authorities have not taken foreign journalists to sites
where there were significant civilian casualties as they have in
the past _ a likely indication that civilian casualties either were
not high or were scattered.
	   Aziz said the United States and Britain should be called to
account for their actions, and then the U.N. economic sanctions
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait should be lifted.
	   He declared the weapons inspection program of the United Nations
Special Commission over, and said the only solution would be ending
the sanctions.
	   ``Iraq cannot tolerate the embargo and UNSCOM,'' Aziz said,
adding that the airstrikes had ended the inspections.
	   ``UNSCOM is their casualty,'' he said.
	   The commission is responsible for dismantling Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction _ chemical, biological or nuclear weapons and
missiles with ranges in excess of 150 kilometers (90 miles).
	   In halting the airstrikes Saturday, U.S. President Bill Clinton
said the 70-hour assault had severely damaged President Saddam
Hussein's ability to build weapons of mass destruction. Clinton
ordered the airstrikes after a report by UNSCOM chief Richard
Butler said Iraq was obstructing the inspectors' work.
	   The attacks on the factories near Baghdad appear to be part of a
strategy to destroy installations that could be used to produce
weapons of mass destruction. Besides the missile facilities, nearly
all of Iraq's military factories were attacked and many sustained
heavy damage, Iraqi officials said, speaking on customary condition
of anonymity.
	   The officials said the attacks have virtually halted Iraqi
efforts to produce short-range missiles. They said the speed of the
attacks took them by surprise and workers did not have enough time
to remove crucial equipment from either factory.
	   In London, Prime Minister Tony Blair's office said Monday that
the airstrikes targeted 100 sites, leaving Saddam's rule weakened
and the Iraqi air defense system ``in ruins.''
	   The sites targeted included 20 command and control facilities
and nine sites linked to the elite Republican Guard, the British
prime minister's spokesman said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   However, Iraq called the confrontation a victory for its people.
	   In his first public comments since the attacks ended Saturday,
Saddam said in a speech Sunday that Iraq defeated ``enemies of
God.''
	   The U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Iraq, Hans von Sponeck,
said Monday that the strikes had disrupted distribution of supplies
under the U.N. program that allows Iraq to export limited amounts
of oil to buy humanitarian supplies.
	   A U.N. warehouse full of rice in Saddam's hometown of Tikrit was
destroyed during the strikes, von Sponeck told Associated Press
Television News.
	   U.N. officials said more than 100 aid workers, who had been
evacuated to Jordan before the airstrikes, would return to Baghdad
on Tuesday.
	   Meanwhile, political fallout from the attacks continued
throughout the region.
	   Syria's governing coalition denounced the Western airstrikes as
a ``a treacherous aggression'' that violated all international
norms.
	   On Saturday, more than 1,000 demonstrators had attacked the U.S.
and British embassies and their cultural institutes to protest the
strikes.
	   The Syrian Foreign Ministry on Sunday expressed regret over the
raids and promised to increase security at diplomatic missions. On
Monday, scores of riot police remained deployed around the American
and British embassies.
	   An extremist Islamic group, meanwhile, threatened retaliation
for the airstrikes.
	   Al-Gamaa al-Islamiya, or the Islamic Group, said in a statement
sent to the Cairo office of Al-Hayat newspaper that the attacks
were ``a disgrace to the Islamic nation,'' the paper reported
Monday.
	   The group called for a ``holy war'' against the United States
and a boycott of American and British products in the Muslim world.
	   Anonymous calls to Al-Hayat also threatened attacks on Kuwaiti
embassies and ``American interests'' in the Gulf.

 &UR; Fossil discovery shows whales older than expected &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Paleontologists digging in the Himalayan
foothills have found a fossilized jawbone and teeth that suggest
whales originated 3.5 million years earlier than scientists had
thought.
	   The new whale species, named Himalayecetus subathuensis, is
about 53.5 million years old, scientists from the University of
Roorkee in India and the University of Michigan reported Monday in
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
	   That makes Himalayecetus the oldest-known whale, 3.5 million
years older than a species found in Pakistan that had been tagged
the most ancient, the scientists reported.
	   The new fossils were found in a shallow, oyster-bearing marine
deposit in the vicinity of the Tethys Sea, a sea that once
separated the Indian subcontinent from the rest of Asia.
	   Previous fossils have suggested that the first whales to evolve
were amphibious, resting and reproducing on land and dipping into
the Tethys Sea or freshwater rivers to feed on fish, the
researchers wrote Monday. The new species supports that theory,
both because of the fossils' location and because the teeth
contained heavy deposits of oxygen isotopes characteristic of land
respiration and ingestion of marine water, they wrote.

Top 25 looks a lot like last week's

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The top 13 teams in The Associated Press' U.S.
college basketball poll Monday remained the same from last week
with Connecticut at No. 1 for a fourth straight week.
	   With only two ranked teams losing last week and four others not
playing, there wasn't much change expected.
	   The Huskies (8-0), who didn't play last week, received 64
first-place votes and 1,738 points from the national media panel,
easily outdistancing Duke (10-1), which was No. 1 on three ballots.
The Blue Devils, who beat North Carolina A and T in their only game
last week, had 1,640 points, 36 more than Kentucky (10-1), which
received two first-place votes.
	   Duke and Kentucky meet Tuesday night in the Jimmy V Classic at
East Rutherford, New Jersey.
	   Cincinnati (9-0), which beat Nicholls State and won road games
against Minnesota and UNLV last week, received the only other
first-place vote and held fourth place with 1,563 points.
	   Maryland, Stanford, North Carolina, Arizona, Purdue and Indiana
rounded out the top 10. Arizona, which won two games last week, and
Purdue, which won one, were tied for eighth last week, but the
Wildcats held that spot alone this week.
	   New Mexico, UCLA and Kansas remained Nos. 11-13, then came the
first movement from last week as St. John's and Michigan State
switched places at 14th and 15th.
	   Clemson and Minnesota stayed 16th and 17th, while Auburn and
Arkansas each moved up a spot to 18th and 19th.
	   Wisconsin moved up three places to 20th and was followed by
Iowa, Syracuse, Oklahoma, Pittsburgh and Oklahoma State.
	   Iowa (8-1), which beat Missouri 82-68 last week, made the week's
biggest jump from 25th to 21st, while Oklahoma State (6-3), which
lost 66-60 to Creighton, had the biggest fall, dropping from 18th
to 25th.
	   The only other ranked team to lose last week was Minnesota,
which lost to Cincinnati 62-61 in overtime.
	   The Top 25 is made up of team's from eight conferences, with six
of them _ Big East, Atlantic Coast, Southeastern, Pac-10, Big Ten
and Big 12 _ each having at least three ranked teams.
	   The Big Ten, which had three teams in the preseason poll _
Michigan State, Purdue and Indiana _ leads the way with six ranked
teams as Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa have joined the Top 25.
	   The Atlantic 10, which had four teams in the preseason poll _
Temple, Xavier, Rhode Island and Massachusetts _ doesn't have any
ranked teams.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Three men hoping to be the first to circle the
world by balloon neared China early Monday, still hoping for
permission to fly on a northerly course but fearing that they may
be ordered to abandon their quest.
	   ``We are effectively in an emergency situation,'' said British
tycoon Richard Branson, who has teamed with American Steve Fossett
and Sweden's Per Linstrand.
	   ``But we are friends with the Chinese people, and this is a

Human rights group resumes work after protest suspension
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's largest human rights group said
Monday it was resuming its activities suspended 19 days ago to
protest what it said was a government campaign of harassment.
	   The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights decided to resume
work ``to continue protecting human rights in Egypt,'' a statement
from the group said.
	   It said the group will continue to disclose ``the abuses that
Egyptian citizens are subjected to regardless of their religion,
ideology or political believes.''
	   The EOHR had suspended work on Dec. 2, a day after the arrest of
its secretary-general, Hafez Abu Saada, on charges of accepting a
dlrs 25,703 donation from the British government in return for
publishing an allegedly false report that damaged the country's
reputation.
	   Abu Saada was released on bail Dec. 6.
	   The government said EOHR took the money without a government
approval.
	   The group has denied the charge, and accused the government of
unleashing a campaign or harassment aimed at blocking it from
uncovering human rights abuses.
	   The EOHR report had accused police of arresting and torturing
hundreds of Coptic Christians in a murder investigation in a
southern Egyptian village in August. The government had denied
widespread abuses.
	   Since the last 19 days, EOHR had stopped sending investigators
into the field, refrained from publishing statements on human
rights cases, and referred citizens with complaints to protest
Saada's arrest.

Researchers zeroing in on gene for sudden-death disorder
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID KOENIG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DALLAS (AP) _ Researchers say they have all but located a gene
responsible for a heart-rhythm abnormality that can cause young,
seemingly healthy people to drop dead without warning.
	   The disorder, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, or
ARVD, could be responsible for 5 percent to 15 percent of sudden
deaths among people under 35.
	   People who are diagnosed with the disorder can be treated with
implanted defibrillators, drugs and, occasionally, surgery. But
often, ARVD goes unnoticed until a person drops dead.
	   Researchers found the gene's approximate location by studying
seven generations of a large Canadian family that included 10
people with ARVD. They hope to isolate the gene and then clone it _
perhaps within a year or two _ and develop a blood test to identify
carriers of the deadly flaw.
	   ``The immediate benefit is you can then screen people who have
the bad gene, and they can have a defibrillator put in,'' said Dr.
Robert Roberts of the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. A
defibrillator shocks the heart to restore a normal rhythm.
	   The findings were published in Tuesday's issue of Circulation, a
journal of the American Heart Association.
	   Roberts' team studied DNA from 149 members of the family and
narrowed down the location of the mutant gene to an area of
chromosome 3.
	   The findings were welcomed by the mother of Andy Stoppelman, who
was 17 when he collapsed and died at a high school yearbook-signing
party in 1993.
	   ``Now that we can identify it, I hope the next step is to remedy
it if not reverse it, so that we can hold onto young lives and not
lose them,'' said Lynn Stoppelman of Reston, Virginia, who started
an Internet support group for victims of the disease.
	   Dr. Hugh Calkins, director of electrophysiology at Johns Hopkins
University, called the findings ``a very significant
breakthrough.''
	   In ARVD, the muscle cells of the right ventricle, which pumps
blood to the lungs, die and are replaced with fatty, fibrous
tissue.
	   It is believed to be rare, afflicting one in every 5,000 people.
Dr. Douglas Zipes, director of the Krannert Institute of Cardiology
in Indianapolis, said the disorder may be more common that doctors
realize because diagnosis is difficult and often is confirmed only
by autopsy.

Ex-IOC member says `extravagant gifts, favors' can buy votes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A small group of IOC members are willing to turn
over blocks of votes in return for ``extravagant gifts and favors''
from cities seeking to stage the Olympics, the only panel member
ever to quit in an ethics scandal said Monday.
	   Robert Helmick, who resigned from the IOC and as president of
the U.S. Olympic Committee in 1991 amid conflict-of-interest
charges, said the gifts could range from fur coats to shopping
sprees for members' wives where thousands of dollars were spent on
clothing.
	   Helmick also said that dlrs 5,000-dlrs 10,000 in first-class
airfare for each member and spouse was ``the minimum that's
expected (from a bid city) before they get to the gifts. That's tit
for tat.''
	   And he blamed IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch to failing to
pay enough attention when allegations of corruption first surfaced
10 years ago.
	   ``He has done a lot of great things for the Olympic movement,''
Helmick said. ``But he did not take this seriously or act promptly,
for whatever reason.''
	   Helmick slipped his resignation under Samaranch's door after
former deputy U.S. Attorney General Arthur Burns found the lawyer
from Des Moines, Iowa, ``repeatedly violated conflict-of-interest
provisions of the USOC and created a perception that he was
trafficking on his Olympic positions for the benefit of private
clients.''
	   It remained the greatest ethics scandal in IOC history until
last week, when senior member Marc Hodler said that another
committee member was among four ``agents'' who promised bid cities
blocks of votes in exchange for payments of up to dlrs 5 million.
	   Hodler's comments followed admissions by organizers of Salt Lake
City's 2002 Winter Games that relatives of six IOC members
benefited from a dlrs 400,000 scholarship fund run by the bid
committee. Hodler called the payments bribes, but later said the
bid had been blackmailed.
	   The IOC and the Salt Lake Organizing Committee are investigating
the scholarships and other possible rules violations by the Utah
bid. The USOC is expected to announce its own probe Tuesday.
	   Like Hodler, Helmick declined to identify any IOC members or bid
committees involved. He said he decided to speak out because the
scandal should not focus on one or two individuals.
	   ``It's the system,'' he said. ``It's people without a
constituency dealing with a lot of money, without checks and
balances. That leads to corruption without the people being
corrupt.''
	   At the point of that corrupt system, Helmick said, ``There are
several IOC members who control blocks of votes who are willing to
deliver them for extravagant gifts and favors.''
	   Bid cities draw up dossiers on all members that include ``their
likes, dislikes and personalities,'' Helmick said. ``That probably
would also include whether their votes are approachable.''
	   Hodler estimated that 5-7 percent of the IOC's 115 members were
open to bribes. Helmick declined to give a figure, but said bid
cities knew which members were susceptible.
	   ``It's a mating game,'' he said. ``Those who don't do it don't
get approached.''
	   Helmick said he never was approached by a bid city offering
enticements during his five years on the IOC.

Cowboys celebrate NFC East title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DENNE H. FREEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   IRVING, Texas (AP) _ Chan Gailey celebrated his first NFC East
championship with the Dallas Cowboys as wildly as he knew how.
	   ``I had a big dinner and a bowl of ice cream,'' he said Monday.
``That's as big as I ever celebrate.''
	   The Dallas coach, the former offensive coordinator for the
Pittsburgh Steelers, flipped the Cowboys from a 6-10 season in
Barry Switzer's final year into a 9-6 team that was the best in a
bad division.
	   Dallas has one game left _ at home against Washington on Sunday
night _ but the outcome won't change the NFC playoff schedule. The
Cowboys will be home against a wild-card team on Jan. 2 or Jan. 3.
	   Gailey predicted the Cowboys would be playing in January during
the July training camp. He kept referring to the team as ``the
1998-99 Dallas Cowboys.''
	   ``If you don't believe you're going to get into the playoffs you
shouldn't be playing,'' Gailey said at the time.
	   On Monday, Gailey said his team is ready for more surprises in
the playoffs.
	   ``Greatness has never been achieved without a challenge,''
Gailey said. ``Pull this off and people will say it's one of the
greatest (upsets) of all time.''
	   Quarterback Troy Aikman, owner of three Super Bowl rings, said
there is no reason the Cowboys can't make an impact in the
postseason.
	   ``I'd like to think we can go all the way,'' Aikman said.
	   Gailey said Aikman deserves a lot of credit for the way Dallas
stayed together after going on a three-game losing streak.
	   ``He kept us focused and gave the team a lot of direction,''
Gailey said.
	   Gailey said Dallas won't go through the motions in the final
game against Washington.
	   ``This team has a chance to win every division game it played
this year and that would be something to really look forward to,''
Gailey said.
	   Dallas swept the season series from Arizona, Philadelphia and
the New York Giants. The Cowboys beat Washington 31-10 on Oct. 4 at
Jack Kent Cooke Stadium.
	   Gailey gave the Cowboys a day off Monday as a reward for winning
the NFC East.
	   ``They earned it,'' he said. ``They had a lot of ups and downs
this year.''

Captains disagree on the use of lights in tests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUNEDIN, New Zealand (AP) _ Indian captain Mohammed Azharuddin
remains opposed to the use of lights in test cricket while his New
Zealand counterpart Stephen Fleming was non-committal after an
experiment Tuesday.
	   Azharuddin felt the use of lights was ``not feasible'' after an
exhibition limited-overs match against a New Zealand XI following
the washout of the first test at Carisbrook.
	   An experimental International Cricket Council (ICC) law allows
the use of lights when available to make up for lost time due to
inclement weather or bad light.
	   But the cricket world remains divided.
	   England and India refused the use of it in the current series
against Australia and New Zealand respectively.
	   The argument is that the use of lights with the red ball is new
to both countries. In day/night one-day cricket white balls are
used with colored clothing and a back sight-screen.
	   Lights have been used successfully in Australia but in South
Africa the fielding sides have complained of difficulty in spotting
the ball.
	   The rule is in a two-year trial period and will be up for
discussion in next year's ICC meeting at Lord's.
	   ``It is my personal opinion,'' Azharuddin said after a 66-run
loss to a New Zealand XI. ``I may be wrong but I don't find it
feasible.''
	   ``I don't think it is good for the game of cricket,'' Azharuddin
said. ``Maybe a lot of players think they have to play when we have
bad light but I don't.
	   ``In a test match both teams should play in the same
conditions,'' Azharuddin said.
	   ``I am happy that we have experimented it, but I don't think it
is here to stay. We have found even the white ball being difficult
to spot at times. What chance do you have with a red ball?''
	   ``Its okay. Everything will depend on how far you want to take
it,'' Fleming said.
	   ``There are variable things to think about. The lights _ how
high or low they are _ the night dew and so on.
	   Fleming was captain of New Zealand when lights were first turned
on in Perth in November 1997.
	   ``If you are looking at extending play to 7 p.m. I don't see any
problems. We've tried it in Australia, in Perth, and thought it was
fine.''
	   ``This was the first real test and there were no real negatives,
so you have to keep experimenting before the law becomes
mandatory,'' he added.

Half of Mexican monarch butterflies traced to Midwest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Half the monarch butterflies wintering in
Mexico come from a relatively compact region of the upper Midwest,
according to scientists who say conservation efforts should be
targeted there.
	   The colorful monarchs breed across the Eastern United States and
in parts of Canada, with more than 100 million of them migrating
each year to spend the winter in Mexico.
	   Scientists finally discovered their winter colonies in 1975 and
since then have struggled to determine migration routes. Tagging
and recapturing butterflies has produced little data.
	   Some of the wintering sites are threatened and the scientists
wanted to know if the loss of any of those areas would endanger the
butterflies. The research indicated that the conservation efforts
should be targeted instead in the states where most of the
butterflies are born.
	   A team of Canadian scientists reports in Tuesday's edition of
the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences their ability
to trace the birthplace of monarchs found in 13 Mexican winter
colonies by analyzing chemicals in the butterfly wings.
	   Using butterflies that died naturally in the colonies, the
researchers determined that the proportions and types of carbon and
hydrogen in the wings varied according to where the monarchs were
born. That is because of differences in the milkweed plants that
the butterfly larvae eat.
	   Half the wintering monarchs were from a ``fairly restricted
geographic part of the breeding range, including the states of
Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan,
Indiana and Ohio,'' the report said.
	   That was true for all of the Mexican winter colonies.
	   Those areas are intensely cultivated and milkweed persists
despite pesticide and weed-control programs, the report said. Fewer
butterflies originated at the northern and southern extremes of
their range because fewer are born there, they concluded.
	   ``Because the primary geographic production area for monarchs is
centered in the American Midwest, that area should be the focal
point for conservation efforts in North America,'' conclude
researchers Leonard I. Wassenaar and Keith A. Hobson. They work for
Environment Canada, the Canadian government agency that studies
weather, nature and the environment.

Rise in average baseball salary slows to 19.3 percent

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The increase in U.S. baseball salaries slowed to
4.7 percent in 1998, and the Baltimore Orioles displaced the New
York Yankees from the top spot for the first time since 1993.
	   The average salary this year was dlrs 1,398,831, according to
final figures released Monday by the U.S. Major League Baseball
Players Association, up from dlrs 1,336,609 last year. This year's
increase is considerably less than the 19.3 percent jump in 1997.
	   Baltimore, which stumbled to a 79-83 record and a fourth-place
finish in the American League East, set a record for team average
at dlrs 2,761,464, breaking the previous mark of dlrs 2,303,437 set
by the 1997 Yankees.
	   New York, which won the World Series for the second time in
three seasons, had the second-highest average at dlrs 2,229,945,
followed by Texas (dlrs 2,108,505), Atlanta (dlrs 2,007,665), the
New York Mets (dlrs 1,959,971) and the National League champion San
Diego Padres (dlrs 1,895,756).
	   All eight postseason teams were among the top 14.
	   Texas soared to third in the salary standings from 13th in 1997
while the Mets jumped to fifth from 15th. The Cubs, who won the NL
wild card, increased from 19th to 11th and the Astros, who won the
NL Central, went from 22nd to 14th.
	   Florida, which won the World Series title in 1997, dropped from
fifth at dlrs 1,793,766 to 28th at dlrs 462,381 following an
unprecedented payroll purge. The Chicago White Sox dropped from
seventh to 17th and Cincinnati fell from 16th to 26th.
	   Montreal had the lowest average salary at dlrs 306,162.
Pittsburgh, last in 1997, was next to last this year at dlrs
459,552.
	   First base once again was the most lucrative position, averaging
dlrs 3,720,005. Designated hitters averaged dlrs 3,312,611,
followed by outfielders (dlrs 2,861,263), third basemen (dlrs
2,770,642), second basemen (dlrs 2,480,481), starting pitchers
(dlrs 2,182,700), catchers (dlrs 2,115,584), shortstops (dlrs
1,565,123) and relievers (dlrs 851,053).
	   With an increase in the minimum salary from dlrs 150,000 to dlrs
170,000, first-year players averaged dlrs 204,314, up from dlrs
176,470 in 1997. Second-year players were at dlrs 254,379, up from
dlrs 217,973.
	   Third-year players eligible for salary arbitration average dlrs
911,058 (up from dlrs 520,556), while those who weren't averaged
dlrs 327,345 (up from dlrs 325,978).
	   Players with between three and four years in the majors averaged
dlrs 1,052,483, up from dlrs 926,033. The average of four-plus
players dropped to dlrs 1,626,893 from dlrs 1,666,583 from, while
five-plus players averaged dlrs 2,476,495, up from dlrs 2,050,366.
	   Six-plus players, the group eligible for free agency for the
first time, averaged dlrs 2,456,226 _ a reflection that many of the
top players approaching free agency were signed to multiyear
contracts with lower salaries in the earlier years of their deals.
	   The highest average was for the 24 players with 11-12 years of
service: dlrs 3,872,582.
	   Figures are based on Aug. 31 rosters and disabled lists and
salaries deferred without interest are discounted to present-day
value. The commissioner's office, which uses a slightly different
method to assess salaries, came up with a final average of dlrs
1,380,099.

Villa returns to top after 1-0 win at Charlton
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ An own goal by Charlton defender Richard Rufus
barely three minutes into the match sent Aston Villa back to the
top of the Premier League Monday after a 1-0 win at struggling
Charlton.
	   There seemed no danger when Dion Dublin crossed the ball into
the Charlton area and Rufus, with plenty of room and time to clear,
watched in horror as the ball bounced awkwardly off his thigh and
rolled past startled goalkeeper Sasa Ilic for what proved to be the
only goal of the game.
	   It meant Villa, who lost the leadership to Chelsea on goal
difference on Saturday, regained a three-point lead with all the
teams level on 18 games. Villa has 36 points, Chelsea 33 and third
place Manchester United 31.
	   Charlton, which has slipped to fourth from last after a
promising start, had chances to level, Andy Hunt heading just too
high before half time and Shaun Newton shooting just past the post
in the second half.

When in trouble, call the Plummer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVE GOLDBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Arizona Cardinals haven't made the playoffs
the past 16 National Football League seasons.
	   The San Francisco 49ers haven't won fewer than 10 games in 18
seasons _ except for the nine-game strike-shortened season of 1982.
They've won five Super Bowls in that time and missed the playoffs
once, in 1991, and they still went 10-6 that year.
	   But the Cardinals finally have something the 49ers don't _ Jake
Plummer,
	   Yes, the 49ers already are in the playoffs with an 11-4 record
and the Cardinals (8-7) still have to beat San Diego to secure the
first playoff berth in 11 seasons in the desert.
	   But they at least have their future quarterback in Plummer, who
is good enough to already get a new contract with a record dlrs 15
million signing bonus.
	   The 49ers, who could have had him, have Jim Druckenmiller.
	   Of all the young quarterbacks to come into the NFL in the last
half-dozen years, Plummer seems to be the best closer, the kind who
can pull out games like Joe Montana, John Elway and Dan Marino. In
Plummer's first two seasons, he's won eight games in which the
Cardinals have trailed or been tied in the fourth quarter and
failed just twice.
	   Both failures were in November.
	   One was in a 23-19 loss to the Giants, when Plummer twice drove
the Cardinals into scoring position needing a touchdown to win.
Once he threw an ill-advised pass that was intercepted, then he
threw a fourth-down pass that was knocked down.
	   The other shouldn't count because it was one of those games
decided by the officials.
	   That was the against the Cowboys, when Plummer brought the Cards
back from a 28-0 deficit to 35-28. But Rob Moore was mugged in the
end zone on the game's last play, a 4-yard pass that would have
tied the score. No flag was thrown.
	   The most recent game-winner came Sunday, when Plummer drove the
Cardinals 69 yards, scrambling for 16 to set up Chris Jacke's field
goal that beat New Orleans 19-17. The win kept Arizona ahead in the
three-way race for the final wild-card spot in the NFC.
	   ``That's what makes Jake,'' said his coach, Vince Tobin. ``He
has tremendous confidence in his ability. He never thinks the
situation is out of hand. He thinks if he has time and the
football, he's going to get some points.''
	   How does that involve the 49ers?
	   For one thing, Plummer plays a lot like Montana and wears his
No. 16.
	   For another, in April 1997, the Niners were looking for a young
quarterback for the inevitable day when Steve Young finally gives
way.
	   They debated between Plummer and Druckenmiller and used their
first-round pick on Druckenmiller, a big, strong-armed QB who
doesn't fit their system. He remains behind both Young and Ty
Detmer, brought in because Druckenmilller wasn't ready to be even a
backup.
	   Plummer went 16 picks later to Arizona in the second round.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; PLAYOFF PICTURE: &LR;  It's as clear as it can be entering the final
weekend.
	   In the NFC, Minnesota (14-1) has home field throughout and
Atlanta (13-2) has a first-round bye and will play a home game the
second week.
	   San Francisco (11-4) will play Green Bay (10-5) in one wild-card
game, at San Francisco unless the 49ers lose at home to the Rams
and Green Bay loses at Chicago. The 49ers have the ``16s'' going
for them _ they've beaten the Rams 16 straight and won 16 straight
regular-season home games.
	   Then there's Dallas (9-6), which stumbled to the NFC East title
by beating Philadelphia 13-9.
	   For those who love to hate America's Team, they're in trouble _
they're probably the fourth best team in their division right now
behind the Giants, Redskins and Cardinals. And they could very well
lose at home to the final wild-card team _ Cardinals (8-7),
Buccaneers (7-8) or Giants (7-8).
	   That final spot goes to the Cards if they beat San Diego (5-10)
at home. If Arizona loses, the Bucs can get it by winning at
Cincinnati (3-12) _ harder than it seems given the fact that Tampa
Bay has never won an outdoor road game in December anywhere other
than Arizona.
	   That would give the Giants the spot if they can win at
Philadelphia (3-12).
	   In the AFC, Denver (13-1) went into Monday night's game in Miami
having clinched home field for the playoffs. The Jets (11-4) are
the second seed, with a week off and then a home game.
	   Jacksonville (10-5) is the third seed as the AFC Central
champion, New England and Buffalo (both 9-6) are wild-cards and
Miami will get the final spot by winning Monday night or next week
at Atlanta.
	   The only other AFC team alive is Tennessee (8-7), which can get
in if Miami loses twice and it beats Minnesota at home next week.

U.S. warns Libya of more sanctions if suspects not handed over
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS new grafs 7-9 with Gadhafi saying he wants an
international panel of judges, original proposal has Scottish
judges. &QL; 
 &UR; With Britain-Lockerbie Anniversary &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Warning Libya that American patience is
running out, the United States said Monday it will seek further
sanctions against Tripoli in February unless two suspects in the
crash of Pan Am Flight 103 are handed over for trial.
	   On the 10th anniversary of the bombing, Britain echoed the
warning, saying it will ask the Security Council to look at further
measures when it holds its scheduled review of Libyan sanctions in
February.
	   ``It is the view of the U.S. government that our patience cannot
continue indefinitely on this subject,'' Deputy U.S. Ambassador
Peter Burleigh said. ``The world community cannot wait forever for
the Libyan authorities to come to a conclusion about this.''
	   British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock called on Libya to fulfill
its obligations under council resolutions and hand over the two
Libyan suspects indicted in connection with the Dec. 21, 1988
bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland which killed 270 people.
	   ``That would be the most fitting memorial to those victims who
we remember today,'' Greenstock said, noting that the bombing was
``the worst terrorist crime in British history.''
	   Last week, Libya's parliament gave its conditional approval for
the trial of the two suspects, but said some obstacles must still
be overcome before the men are handed over.
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi said in an interview aired Monday
on the Dutch current affairs program 2 Vandaag that he wants an
international panel of judges to try the suspects ``because that is
independent.'' The panel should include judges from the United
States, Britain and Libya, he said.
	   ``Negotiations must continue. The door must remain open ... We
want to do everything to reach a solution,'' Gadhafi said.
	   The original U.S.-British proposal calls for three Scottish High
Court judges to serve as a jury using Scottish law.
	   The United States and Britain stressed Monday that their
governments have provided clarifications sought by Libya through
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and his legal adviser and it's
now time for Libya to comply.
	   In August, the Security Council adopted a resolution supporting
the Anglo-American initiative to try the two Libyans in the
Netherlands and pledged to suspend sanctions as soon as they
arrived for trial.
	   The sanctions included a ban on air travel from and to Libya,
restricting diplomatic personnel and banning the purchase of oil
equipment.
	   The Security Council made clear that if the two Libyans were not
handed over promptly, it would consider further sanctions _ and the
United States and Britain on Monday set a deadline of February's
sanctions review.
	   ``If by that time, the government of Libya has not handed over
the suspects for trial ... we will seek additional measures to
compel compliance,'' Burleigh said. ``We will not tolerate the
Libyan regime's continued defiance of the international community.
Ten years is much too long to wait for justice.''
	   Annan, who met with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi earlier this
month to discuss a possible handover of the suspects, said Monday
he remains hopeful of ``a positive decision'' from the Libyan
government _ and told relatives of the victims not to give up hope.
	   ``I had hoped it would come before this date, the anniversary,
but I have not lost hope and they (the relatives) should not,''
Annan said. ``It's regrettable that 10 years after the event we
have not been able to get to the truth so that they can put this
behind them, mourn their dead and carry on with their lives.''

Parliament approves budget to push Greece into single currency
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Parliament approved on Monday the
cost-cutting budget for 1999, the most crucial year in Greece's
attempt to join the European Union's single currency group.
	   The budget was passed by 161 votes in favor and 136 against in
Greece's 300-member unicameral parliament. One deputy abstained and
two were absent.
	   Premier Costas Simitis has made qualification for the single
currency by Jan. 2001 the cornerstone of his socialist government's
policy.
	   Greece will have to meet all criteria by the end of 1999 if it
is to qualify one year later. Staying out would make the country an
economic backwater in the 15-nation EU, Simitis says.
	   ``Our country's entry into the economic and monetary union
became ... an essential issue. Our government will have played a
catalytic role in the materialization of this target,'' Simitis
said during his parliamentary speech.
	   Praising the economy's progress in recent years, the premier
stressed Greece is ready to join the single currency. ``In about
one-and-a-half years from today, (Greece) will have achieved
something which a few years ago seemed impossible,'' he said.
	   Greece was the only EU member which failed to qualify for
participation in the single currency, due to be introduced in
January. Britain, Denmark and Sweden have opted out for now.
	   The 1999 budget seeks to reduce the general deficit to 1.9
percent of gross domestic product from an expected 2.2 percent at
the end of this year. This is well below the qualification criteria
of 3 percent.
	   Inflation, however, remains Greece's main challenge. The
government has reduced prices on some consumer goods and is
attempting to restrict wage increases in an attempt to lower
inflation, which stood at 4.7 percent in October.
	   EU single currency criteria set an inflation ceiling based on
the top performing countries, which is expected to be about 2.5
percent next year.
	   But years of fiscal austerity programs have resulted in
widespread labor protests and strikes in both the public and
private sectors against plans to trim the public sector, privatize
state enterprises and limit wage increases.
	   Labor unions intensified their strikes during the months leading
up to the parliamentary vote on the budget.
	   A customs workers' walk-out in November led to an acute fuel
shortage around the country, while a general strike on Dec. 15
paralyzed the country.

Brief council statement shows road to new Iraq policy is long
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NYR107 &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ After a four-day bombing campaign that
shattered its consensus, the U.N. Security Council finally issued a
one sentence statement Monday which indicated that the road to a
new Iraq policy will be long and tortuous.
	   The 15-member council remains united on the need to disarm Iraq
but sharply at odds on how to do it, and some diplomats say it may
take weeks to reach agreement on a new strategy.
	   The five permanent members _ the United States, Britain, France,
Russia and China _ are divided over the future of the commission
charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, the
future of its director Richard Butler, and the future of sanctions
against Baghdad.
	   At the end of Monday's council meeting _ the fourth since the
Iraqi bombing began on Wednesday _ the council president, Bahrain's
Ambassador Jassim Mohammed Buallay, read a press statement
reflecting the limited consensus that exists now.
	   ``The Security Council is in the process of assessing its
approach to (the) Iraq question and how best to implement the
relevant Security Council resolutions, and intends to pursue this
question actively, in accordance with its primary responsibility
under the (U.N.) Charter for the maintenance of international peace
and security,'' the statement said.
	   The council scheduled another meeting on Iraq on Tuesday
morning.
	   ``We are picking up the pieces and setting them out and we'll be
prepared to glue them back again if we can in the council _ maybe
to construct a different sort of pot in due course,'' said
Britain's U.N. Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock.
	   ``The discussion in the council has to go along with some very
active diplomacy by our ministers in between capitals,'' he added.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has been speaking to
world leaders and council members about the next steps in dealing
with Iraq, told reporters ``it is not helpful that the council is
divided.''
	   ``I would hope in the weeks ahead we will find a way of bringing
everyone together,'' he said.
	   The United States and Britain want the U.N. Special Commission,
known as UNSCOM, to continue its eight-year job of trying to verify
the destruction of Iraq's biological and chemical weapons and its
long-range missiles. And they support Butler, whose report last
week concluding that Iraq failed to cooperate fully with U.N.
weapons inspectors triggered the U.S. and British bombing.
	   ``UNSCOM is a very important mechanism of the Security Council
to ensure the disarmament of Iraq and we look forward to UNSCOM's
early and full return to Iraq,'' Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter
Burleigh said.
	   France is floating a still murky proposal for a modified version
of UNSCOM that would prevent Iraq from acquiring banned weapons,
include long-term monitoring, and lift sanctions which Paris
contends cause unintended hardship on the Iraqi people.
	   Under the cease-fire resolution ending the 1991 Persian Gulf
war, an oil embargo against Iraq can't be lifted unless UNSCOM
certifies that it has been disarmed.
	   Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz complicated that
prospect, declaring Monday that UNSCOM's inspection program was
over and the only solution was lifting sanctions. ``Iraq cannot
tolerate the embargo and UNSCOM,'' Aziz said.
	   Russia and China, the most vocal opponents of the bombing, have
also called for the lifting of sanctions and gone a step further _
demanding Butler's ouster.
	   Britain's Greenstock noted that a number of countries were
uncomfortable with Butler's report.
	   ``It was uncomfortable. ... But it was a professional
assessment. That was not a reason to shoot the messenger,''
Greenstock said. ``We regard UNSCOM as efficient and professional
under executive chairman Butler's leadership.''
	   Russia has also tabled a non-binding draft statement calling for
an expression of regret for the attacks _ which would never be
acceptable to the United States and Britain _ and for Iraq to
comply with council resolutions.

Basque group reiterates its willing to negotiate with Spain
</HEADLINE>
government &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The armed Basque separatist group ETA
reiterated its willingness Monday to open peace negotiations with
the government, but fell short of announcing a permanent cease-fire
as has been demanded by Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar.
	   ETA also said that there have been no direct contacts yet with
Aznar's government. The group apparently was responding to a
government spokesman's statement Friday that officials had made
``significant contacts'' in peace efforts with ETA.
	   The organization, blamed for nearly 800 killings in its
30-year-old battle for an independent Basque homeland in northern
Spain, began an open-ended, unconditional cease-fire Sept. 18.
	   Aznar has said the group must do more to show that it is
committed to a permanent peace before substantial negotiations can
begin.
	   In its three-page announcement Monday, written in the Basque
language, ETA said it will maintain its truce but it made no
mention of making its cease-fire permanent or of laying down its
arms.
	   The government, in a goodwill gesture, announced Friday that 21
ETA inmates from far-flung prisons will be moved to jails closer to
their homes.
	   Those transfers will take place Tuesday.
	   ETA, a Basque-language acronym which stands for Basque Homeland
and Freedom, has long demanded that the more than 500 ETA prisoners
held in Spanish jails be transferred closer to home.
	   The government keeps them scattered around Spain to prevent them
from plotting while behind bars.

Balloon team crosses into China without permission
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more detail of crossing into China; no UPPICK &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Three men hoping to be the first to circle the
world by balloon crossed into Chinese air space Monday night,
despite the refusal of the Chinese authorities to grant them
permission.
	   Flying very close to its maximum altitude at 29,000 feet (8,840
meters), the balloon piloted by British tycoon Richard Branson,
American Steve Fossett and Sweden's Per Linstrand crossed between
Nepal and Chinese-ruled Tibet, their support team in London
confirmed.
	   The adventurers were flying in pitch darkness Monday night over
some of the world's highest peaks _ in hostile terrain that makes
landing impossible and rescue about seven days away. And landing
the balloon would mean the end of the challenge.
	   Project director Mike Kendrick said Chinese air traffic
controllers were informed the moment the balloon passed over the
border, with an apology added to the communication.
	   China had given permission for the ICO Global balloon to travel
in its airspace south of 26 degrees north latitude. But because of
diversions around Mediterranean storms and Iraq, the balloon
crossed the Himalayas further north than planned and entered China
250 miles north of the agreed airspace corridor.
	   ``We will wait for the Chinese to contact us now. It is
important their air traffic controllers know they are there, and
beyond that we will have to wait and see,'' Kendrick said.
	   The Chinese have not yet responded or acknowledged the message,
said ICO spokeswoman Lori Levin. She said the team have been
contacting the Chinese every 15 minutes to let them know where the
balloon is and were not expecting any response until about 0130
GMT, when daylight breaks.
	   Kendrick said the mood among the crew and support team was one
of nervousness.
	   ``We are in someone else's airspace without permission _ it is
not a nice place to be,'' he said.
	   As it became apparent early Monday that the balloon would
inevitably cross into unauthorized Chinese territory, frantic
diplomatic negotiations were launched by the British government, to
no avail.
	   Kendrick said the next few hours would be vital, given that the
long journey across China was an inescapable part of any
round-the-world bid.
	   ``If we don't go through China, we don't do a global flight,''
he said. ``We have to go through China _ that is the bottom line.
All I'm hoping is that we can stay in the air for long enough.''
	   Kendrick said he does not anticipate the Chinese will take
strong action.
	   ``They seem like nice people to me. I think the attitude is we
would like to help and we will give you all the help we can give
you _ except the bit about letting you fly through,'' he said.
	   The three-man crew, all veteran balloonists, also had a problem
before crossing Libya, when permission was unexpectedly revoked.
That was resolved on Saturday just before the balloon entered
Libyan airspace.
	   Then, in conditions marred by thunderstorms, the crew had to
maneuver the 270-foot (82-meter) craft through narrow gaps between
no-fly territories, including war-torn Iraq.
	   The crew members estimate the trip could last from eight days to
nearly three weeks. They hope to touch down somewhere in western
Europe at the end of a 24,000-mile (38,000 kms) flight, which will
take them over India, the South China sea, the Pacific and the
United States.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and initially had only four refusals _ Iran, Iraq, Russia and North
Korea.

U.N. calls for national unity government in Guinea-Bissau
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council unanimously
called Monday for the urgent establishment of a government of
national unity in Guinea-Bissau and elections no later than March.
	   Guinea-Bissau's President Joao Bernardo Vieira and rebel leader
Brig. Ansumane Mane agreed on a government of national unity in
November, after four months of fighting, and set presidential
elections for March.
	   The Security Council resolution calls for the holding of general
elections as well as presidential elections, the withdrawal of all
foreign troops, and the deployment of West African peacekeepers.
	   The West African force will replace troops from Senegal and
Guinea, who sent troops to the small West African country and
former Portuguese colony in June to help Vieira contain the
military rebellion lead by Mane.
	   The Security Council also asked Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
make recommendations on a possible U.N. role in the peace process,
including the early establishment of a liaison between the United
Nations and the West African peacekeepers.
	   Civil war broke out June 7 when disenchanted colonial war
veterans rebelled against Vieira's allegedly corrupt regime. About
half of Guinea-Bissau's 1 million inhabitants were displaced by the
fighting.
	   The council called on all parties to respect international law
``including humanitarian and human rights law, and to ensure safe
and unimpeded access by international humanitarian organizations to
persons in need of assistance as a result of the conflict.''

Ewing disagrees with the Mailman; league's deal is no better
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEFF GOODMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Karl Malone called the National Basketball
Association's latest offer ``fair'' and ``decent.'' Patrick Ewing
disagrees, and many other players are standing with him.
	   ``That deal is the same deal we've been going over for the last
two or three weeks _ maybe even longer,'' the New York Knicks star
and union president said.
	   Malone was referring to a nine-page letter the league sent to
players on Thursday, outlining the owners' concessions.
	   ``They haven't changed their position one iota. All they did was
make the numbers look great, but it's not a good deal,'' Ewing
said.
	   The players' association negotiating committee held an internal
meeting Monday, with about 125 players listening in on a conference
call. The players gave union director Billy Hunter their thoughts
should the sides meet in the near future.
	   Monday marked the ninth day since the last round of bargaining,
and players continue to lose dlrs 50 million a week in salaries as
the lockout drags on. No new talks are scheduled, with commissioner
David Stern on vacation.
	   If a deal isn't reached soon, the entire season will be
scrapped. Stern has steadfastly refused to say when it will be too
late to save the season.
	   The league and the players are trying to determine how to divide
about dlrs 2 billion in annual revenues.
	   Sonics center Jim McIlvaine was among those who attended the
union meeting in New York. He sided with Ewing.
	   ``We came out on this morning's meeting the same,'' McIlvaine
said at an event in Harlem where he and Ewing handed out Christmas
presents to underprivileged children. Knicks teammates Herb
Williams, John Starks and Marcus Camby also attended.
	   ``We just wanted to clarify some things. There's a lot of
stumbling blocks in order to make the deal and the big one is
control,'' McIlvaine said.
	   He added that Malone's version of adjustment may not be the same
as everyone else's.
	   ``That could be a presidential definition of `tweak,'''
McIlvaine added. ```Tweak' for him could mean a major modification
for someone else.''
	   One of the items that continued to be a topic for the players
was to try to take care of the middle-range salary players.
	   ``Karl said he liked the deal, but he also said there's things
that need to be changed,'' Herb Williams said. ``If you look at the
numbers, they look good. The superstars are going to get their
money, but we're trying to take care of the guys in the middle.''

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilian President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso said Monday his government exceeded its own goals for
agrarian reform over the last four years.
	   Cardoso said during his first term 287,539 families were settled
on new land, surpassing the goal of 200,000 families.
	   The Landless Rural Workers Movement _ which organizes
large-scale land invasions in an effort to pressure the government
into speeding it's land reform program _ contested the government's
figures.
	   Movement leader Joao Pedro Stedile said 130,000 to 150,000
families were actually settled.
	   Brazil has one of the worst land distributions in the world with
20 percent of the population owning 88 percent of the land, while
the poorest 40 percent own just 1 percent.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala (AP) _ A mob of as many as 3,000
people captured four men as they allegedly tried to rob a house,
then beat them, doused them with gasoline and burned them, police
said Monday.
	   The lynchings on Sunday _ which brought the total of such
killings in Guatemala to 38 this year _ took place in the village
of Campur, about 55 miles (90 kilometers) north of Guatemala City.
	   The four men were carrying assault rifles and were reportedly
trying to rob a house when the villagers captured them and took
away their guns, the National Civil Police reported.
	   The wave of lynchings has been driven by increasing criminal
activity in Guatemala and complaints about the country's
inefficient legal system.
	   ___
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ The Roman Catholic Church expressed
alarm Monday at a rise in unemployment in Honduras due to damage
caused by Hurricane Mitch.
	   ``Many centers of production have disappeared in the country...
and the situation of unemployment is tending to worsen,'' said the
church's weekly magazine, Fides.
	   Government figures indicate that unemployment over the past 48
days has risen to 42 percent from 32 percent in a country where
even those with jobs often remain in poverty.
	   The storm that struck Honduras at the end of October damaged
much of the country's road system as well as the chief export
crops, bananas and coffee.
	   The church magazine said ``the government should find creative
formulas to stimulate production based on self-initiative,'' but it
also praised President Carlos Flores Facusse for his response to
the storm, which killed some 5,600 people in Honduras and 9,000 in
the region as a whole.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A four story building collapsed
Monday in a poor area of Rio de Janeiro but nobody was hurt,
authorities said.
	   The building, in the Osvaldo Cruz neighborhood, had been
evacuated since Sunday when residents noticed that two structural
beams appeared on the verge of collapse, said fireman Francisco
Silva Cunha.
	   All 11 apartments and the five street-level shops in the
building were destroyed.
	   Cunha said the building's top two stories appeared to have been
illegally added to the original structure.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ A small-town mayor has been
arrested on charges of falsifying documents to help people obtain
U.S. visas, officials said Monday.
	   The border police arrested Pedro Velasquez, mayor of Santiago
Nonualco, over the weekend. The federal prosecutor's office said he
had been found with incriminating documents.
	   Velasquez denied the allegations. He was apparently implicated
in the case by an attorney arrested earlier, Agustin Rauda.
	   Investigators say people who wanted to travel to the United
States would pay for false documents identifying them as close
relatives of people who already had U.S. visas.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ President Alberto Fujimori said Monday that
reaching the recently signed peace treaty with Ecuador was the
toughest problem he has faced as president.
	   Fujimori and Ecuadorean President Jamil Mahuad on Oct. 26 signed
an internationally brokered treaty ending a border dispute that had
erupted in wars in 1941, 1981 and 1995.
	   But the treaty, which includes the demarcation of 49 miles (78
kilometers) of land, offended nationalists on both sides of the
border who felt their government ceded territory.
	   ``The problem with Ecuador was as onerous for the development of
Peru as terrorism and hyperinflation, and in my opinion was the
most difficult for us to resolve,'' Fujimori said during a speech
at a military academy.
	   The countries had tried to negotiate an end to the dispute since
the end of the 1995 war, but failed. They finally asked four
guarantor nations, including the United States, to dictate a
resolution to the conflict.
	   The conflict had sparked an arms race between the poor Andean
neighbors.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Christmas celebrations, cold windless weather
and even ash showers from a nearby volcano boosted smog levels in
Mexico City on Monday, forcing authorities to extend a pollution
alert for the fourth straight day.
	   It was this year's second four-day air pollution alert, in which
traffic is curtailed and activities reduced in schools and
factories.
	   ``Weather conditions, factory emissions and poorly-tuned car
engines are the main causes,'' Mexico City Environment Secretary
Alejandro Encinas said.
	   Holiday traditions such as setting off fireworks and burning
tires in bonfires also contributed to the smog, Encinas said.
	   Unlike previous smog emergencies, including a record five-day
emergency in November 1996, the culprit this time was not ozone _ a
colorless, odorless pollutant _ but tiny particles of suspended
dust and smoke.
	   Those particles reached 1 1-2 times the acceptable levels
Monday.
	   The Popocatepetl Volcano, 50 miles (80 kms) southeast of this
city of 8.5 million people, also played a role when it sent a light
showering of ash onto parts of the city early Monday.

	   A summary of news from The Associated Press. Some items have
moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f'' category
codes:
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's parliament rejected Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's peace policies Monday, then gave initial
approval to a bill calling early elections. The election bill must
be approved twice more, but Netanyahu has said he will not attempt
to block its passage. Early parliamentary elections, which could
come any time in the next three to six months, will mean yet
another delay in the Mideast peace process. The call for early
elections followed Netanyahu's fruitless, last-minute appeal to the
opposition Labor Party to negotiate a national unity government.
(ISRAEL-POLITICS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter
proposed Monday to end the impeachment proceedings against
President Bill Clinton with a bipartisan censure resolution stating
that he lied under oath. The linchpin would be language stating
that Clinton accepted the findings in the resolution. But his
admission that he did not tell the truth could not be used against
him in a future trial. ``Somehow we must reach a conclusion that
most Americans can embrace and that posterity will approve,'' Ford
and Carter wrote in an op-ed column published in The New York
Times. (US-CLINTON-IMPEACHMENT)
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.S. and British airstrikes demolished
Iraq's two main factories for producing parts for short-range
missiles permitted by the United Nations, Iraqi officials said
Monday. The four nights of airstrikes also killed 62 soldiers and
injured 180 others, said Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz.
He said civilian casualties were ``much, much higher,'' but did not
give figures. ``The serious damage was in civilian sites,'' Aziz
said, calling it ``the American way of war.'' Sites attacked
included hospitals, private homes and schools, he said. Despite the
four days of attacks, the United States had failed to make any dent
in the Iraqi military might, Aziz said. (IRAQ)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Warning Libya that American patience is
running out, the United States said Monday it will seek further
sanctions against Tripoli in February unless two suspects in the
crash of Pan Am Flight 103 are handed over for trial. On the 10th
anniversary of the bombing, Britain echoed the warning, saying it
will ask the Security Council to look at further measures when it
holds its scheduled review of Libyan sanctions in February. British
Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock called on Libya to fulfill its
obligations under council resolutions and hand over the two Libyan
suspects indicted in connection with the Dec. 21, 1988 bombing over
Lockerbie, Scotland which killed 270 people. (UN-LOCKERBIE
ANNIVERSARY)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Three men hoping to be the first to circle the
world by balloon crossed into Chinese air space Monday night,
despite the refusal of the Chinese authorities to grant them
permission. Flying very close to its maximum altitude at 29,000
feet (8,840 meters), the balloon piloted by British tycoon Richard
Branson, American Steve Fossett and Sweden's Per Linstrand crossed
between Nepal and Chinese-ruled Tibet, their support team in London
confirmed. The adventurers were flying in pitch darkness Monday
night over some of the world's highest peaks _ in hostile terrain
that makes landing impossible and rescue about seven days away. And
landing the balloon would mean the end of the challenge.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Standard and Poor's 500 index and the Nasdaq
composite set new highs Monday as the expected impeachment of
President Bill Clinton failed to derail a powerful technology
rally. The Dow Jones industrial average rose as much as 175 points
before closing 85.22 points higher _ or 1 percent _ at 8,988.85,
about 400 points from record terrain. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The financial firestorm that began last year
in Asia and hit Russia this summer still poses severe threats, but
the dangers of a worldwide recession have eased in recent weeks,
the International Monetary Fund said Monday. The IMF credited
interest rate cuts in the United States and elsewhere for helping
to stabilize a situation that in August and September was
threatening to spiral out of control after Russia's default on
billions of dollars of foreign loans buffeted investors from New
York to Buenos Aires. The 182-nation lending agency stressed in an
updated ``World Economic Outlook'' issued Monday that even with
markets now stabilized, the global economy faced numerous risks in
1999 and it would be ``premature to consider the difficulties to be
over.'' (IMF-WORLD OUTLOOK)
	   PARIS (AP) - French defense group Thomson-CSF said the planned
cut of 4,000 jobs worldwide was part of a three-year plan to raise
the company's operating profit. Company Chairman Denis Ranque said
in Monday's edition of the French business daily Les Echos that
Thomson aimed to raise operating profits to 7 percent of sales by
2001 from the current 5.7 percent. Ranque said the company's
profitability was within the industry's average, ``But it's not
enough for whomever wants to be a leader in the sector.'' He said
the cuts announced Friday - nearly 3,000 in France and more than
1,000 elsewhere - were made necessary by industry changes, the
merger with Dassault Electronique and Alcatel's military
telecommunications activities and the need to cut production costs.
(FRANCE-THOMSON)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Escalating a nasty trade fight with the
European Union over bananas, the United States announced Monday it
will slap hundreds of millions of dollars of punitive tariffs on
products ranging from sheep's milk cheese to cashmere sweaters.
U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said that the United
States was exercising its rights under the World Trade Organization
to impose penalties on the 15-nation Europe Union for, in the U.S.
view, unfairly blocking U.S. companies from selling bananas from
Latin America to Europe. The penalties _ 100 percent tariffs _ will
effectively double the price to American consumers of targeted
items. They could go into effect as soon as Feb. 2, or as late as
March 3, depending on whether the European Union elects to
arbitrate the content of the list. (US-EU-BANANA WAR)
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Trade between Iran and Saudi Arabia is
expected to nearly triple to dlrs 2 billion, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported Monday. A joint economic commission
that met in Saudi Arabia recently agreed to boost trade and
cooperation in several sectors, IRNA quoted a report that appeared
over the weekend in the Jiddah-based Arab News daily. ``We are in
the process of acquainting ourselves with regulatory provisions of
the kingdom in order to remove all existing trade and investment
barriers,'' the report quoted Assalloh Asgaroladi, deputy head of
the Iranian chamber of commerce, as saying. He said trade between
Iran and Saudi Arabia is expected to reach 7.5 billion Saudi riyals
(dlrs 2 billion) next year. Total bilateral trade between Iran and
Saudi Arabia is currently about 2.6 billion Saudi riyals (dlrs 693
million). (MIDDLE EAST-BUSINESS BRIEFS)

Vanessa Redgrave, Pat Boone, Robin Williams.

<TEXT>
	   BEVERLY HILLS, California (AP) _ George Michael completed 80
hours of community service as part of his no-contest plea to lewd
conduct in a park restroom, his attorney told a judge in a progress
report Monday on the British pop star.
	   Attorney Brad Barnholtz appeared on behalf of Michael, who was
not present for the proceeding.
	   Municipal Court Judge Charles Rubin reiterated that Michael was
under a court order to stay out of Will Rogers Park for the
duration of his probation, about 17 more months.
	   ``Make sure he is reinformed of that,'' Rubin said after
Barnholtz gave the judge proof that Michael completed the community
service at Hugh O'Brian Youth Leadership and paid dlrs 910 in
fines. Michael also participated in five, one-hour counseling
sessions.
	   Michael, 35, was arrested April 7 by an undercover police
officer in a restroom at the park across from the Beverly Hills
Hotel on Sunset Boulevard. The entertainer was placed on two years'
probation and was told that any future lewd acts would land him in
jail.
	    &UR; ___
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Singer Julio Iglesias says he's
proud of his children, including rocker Enrique Iglesias, but
credits his fame with opening doors for them professionally.
	   ``They are lucky to be my children,'' he said Sunday during a
news conference in San Juan to present a greatest-hits album.
``They have great luck in that doors have opened for them so
rapidly.''
	   The Spanish singer has reportedly clashed with Enrique over his
son's success, and in 1997 Enrique told the L.A. Times he didn't
like discussing music with the elder Iglesias because his record
sales had eclipsed his father's.
	   Enrique, 23, is the youngest of three children of Iglesias and
Isabel Preysler. Sister Chabeli is a Spanish-language TV
personality, and brother Julio Jose is a singer and model.
	   Enrique won a Grammy Award for best Latin pop performer in 1997.
	   The elder Iglesias, who begins an Asian tour in Hong Kong on
Jan. 21, said he is looking forward to the birth of his second
child with 30-year-old companion Miranda Rijnsburger. Rijnsburger
gave birth to a boy last year.
	   Iglesias, 55, opened his news conference by telling reporters he
has no plans to marry and has sex five times a day. ``Vertically.
Always vertically.''
	   ___
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Germans waved down a new micro-compact
car for free test drives Monday, but Stuttgart taxi drivers weren't
amused.
	   Some 20 two-seat Smart cars circulating in the city were
stopping for people hailing them at taxi stands, said Peter
Kristan, a spokesman for local taxi operators.
	   ``It's a promotion stunt to the detriment of our business,'' he
said.
	   Kristan said he was especially upset because Smarts are made by
a unit of Daimler-Chrysler, which also makes the pale yellow
Mercedes taxis that are a fixture on German streets.
	   He said the taxi operators were calling a protest strike of
several hours Tuesday.
	   Daimler-Chrysler placed ads in newspapers around Germany for
people to wave down Smart cars marked with a waving hand for a
30-minute test ride.
	   A Daimler-Chrysler spokesman said the promotion was not aimed at
stealing customers from taxis. ``We beg them to accept our
apologies if this has led to some irritation,'' he said.
	    &UR; ___
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ The wife of Gov.-elect Jesse ``The Body''
Ventura has no doubts about her husband's ability to handle his new
job. It's herself she's worried about.
	   ``I'm worried about how I'll do a lot more than how he'll do,''
said Terry Ventura, wife of the former wrestler-turned-politician.
``I'll be picking up the wrong fork. I'll be the one tripping down
the stairs in her formal gown.''
	   In an interview taped for Tuesday's ``Dateline NBC'' television
show, Mrs. Ventura said her reaction to her husband's upset victory
on Nov. 3 was not entirely joyful.
	   ``When I saw the big check mark on the TV screen, at one point I
went and sat in my mom's lap and cried,'' Mrs. Ventura said. ``I
was afraid that I don't know how to do this. I don't know how _
what _ to be. My mom said, `Just be who you are.'''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Pat Boone, fit and tan at 64, attributes his
good health to tennis, pumping iron _ and soup.
	   ``My breakfast is generally vegetable soup,'' he said in
Monday's Los Angeles Times. ``I always was a cereal guy. I wanted
the fiber. But if you eat plenty of vegetables you'll get plenty of
fiber.''
	   Boone still drinks milk, but less of it, and skim.
	   ``I cut way down on milk. People say, `Don't you still drink a
lot of milk?' Well, no. I advertised milk for years. Love it. We
still keep 2 percent or skim milk in the refrigerator,'' Boone
said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Robin Williams says playing positive characters
like Patch Adams comes from his desire to connect with people.
	   ``That's why I've only done one film where I've played, in
essence, a villain,'' Williams said in Monday's Daily News.
	   ``Patch Adams'' is based on the life of a doctor who believes in
the healing power of humor.
	   ``I've seen the healing power of laughter one-on-one with Chris
Reeve. I've seen with other people the effect it has. I've seen it
visiting children's wards.''
	   If serious fails for Williams, there's always zany.
	   ``The zany, kind of wild performance things is something I
choose to do. It's not something I have to do.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   CULVER CITY, California (AP) _ Vanessa Redgrave has joined
Winona Ryder in the cast of ``Girl Interrupted,'' Columbia Pictures
said Monday.
	   The drama will star Ryder as author Susanna Kaysen, who in the
1960s was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and spent
two years in a New England psychiatric ward.
	   Redgrave will portray the psychiatrist who confronts Kaysen and
helps her reclaim her life.
	   Angelina Jolie, Whoopi Goldberg and Brittany Murphy will also
appear.
	   The movie, based on Kaysen's book, is scheduled for release next
October.

Chinese pro-democracy campaigners get long prison terms

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The quick trials and harsh punishments given to
two leading pro-democracy campaigners has undermined China's
tentative steps to bring its judicial system closer to
international standards.
	   And the lengthy prison terms handed down Monday showed how
firmly China's ruling Communist Party draws the line at open
opposition.
	   After only half a day of testimony, the courts issued their
verdicts to the dissidents: one who was the first to try to set up
an opposition party, the other a veteran activist who tried to
rally support for the group.
	   The 13-year prison term given Xu Wenli after his trial in
Beijing on Monday was the longest for a Chinese dissident in three
years. Xu earlier served 12 years in prison _ much of it in
solitary confinement _ for his involvement in the Democracy Wall
movement of the late 1970s.
	   Wang Youcai, a student leader in the 1989 Tiananmen Square
demonstrations who declared the formation of the opposition group
in June, was sentenced to 11 years. His verdict was announced by a
court in Hangzhou, eastern China.
	   Activists have tried to set up branches of the China Democracy
Party in 14 provinces and cities. Xu advised them and helped them
communicate with one another.
	   Xu said in court that his work was entirely peaceful and open,
said his wife, He Xintong, who was the only family member or friend
allowed to observe the trial.
	   Court officials denied requests from a U.S. Embassy official to
attend the trial. Police sealed off Beijing's No. 1 Intermediate
People's Court and kept foreign reporters about half a kilometer
(one-third of a mile) away.
	   Xu defiantly refused to appeal the verdict or to answer any
questions by the prosecutors and judges because he believed the
trial was political persecution ordered by China's rulers, his wife
said.
	   In court ``he was courageous, fantastic,'' she said in a
telephone interview late Monday. ``He said, `I'm willing use the
sacrifice of myself to promote democracy in China. I'm not one who
encourages a struggle and then just lets others shed their
blood.'''
	   After the trial, court officials tried to prevent her from
meeting with foreign reporters by offering to take her to see her
husband, she said. When she got to the detention center, they
suddenly refused, but Ms. He said she persisted and visited with
him for 30 minutes.
	   The U.S. government was ``deeply disappointed with both the
guilty verdict and the extremely harsh sentence given to Mr. Xu,''
said a statement from the embassy in Beijing. ``No individual
should be arrested, tried or sentenced for exercising
internationally recognized freedoms.''
	   In Washington, the State Department called on Chinese
authorities to release the men immediately.
	   ``This form of peaceful political expressed deserves the
protection of all governments,'' said Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott. ``We not only deplore that they were detained and
tried for such actions but are deeply disturbed by the long
sentences imposed and the lack of due process.''
	   Talbott said the trials were not open to members of the public
who wished to attend or to foreign observers, nor were the
defendants afforded the opportunity to select their own attorneys
or prepare a serious defense.
	   He added that China's international obligations ``require it to
protect peaceful political expression and association and to ensure
a fair public trial.''
	   China recently signed key U.N. human rights covenants but it has
not allowed political organizing and refused to let the China
Democracy Party register. The ruling Communist Party has never
allowed an opposition party.
	   The crackdown intensified last month when police arrested Xu and
Qin Yongmin, another veteran of the Democracy Wall movement, and
announced charges against Wang, who was already in custody.
	   Xu and Qin were given less than four days to prepare their
cases. Wang and Qin were put on trial on Thursday without defense
attorneys after police detained or otherwise scared off potential
lawyers; Xu had a court-appointed attorney.
	   The court was expected to reconvene in Qin's case in the central
city of Wuhan on Tuesday, said Qin's brother, Qin Xiaoguang.
	   Judges in Beijing and Hangzhou found that Xu and Wang plotted
subversion by founding branches of the China Democracy Party in
both cities and accepting money from abroad, the official Xinhua
News Agency said in a rare mention of dissident activities.
	   Wei Jingsheng, Xu's colleague from the Democracy Wall era,
protested the sentences during a visit to Taiwan on Monday, saying
``The Chinese Communist authorities' behavior is totally
unrestrained and irrational.''
	   Wei was sentenced to 15 years in prison in 1979, and Xu to 15
years in 1982. Both were released in 1993, but Wei was arrested
again a few months later, sentenced in 1995 to 14 years, released
last year and sent into exile.
	   In an effort to blunt international criticism of Monday's
sentences, China released a labor rights campaigner, Liu Nianchun,
from 3 1/2 years in prison camps on Sunday and sent him into exile
in the United States with his wife and 11-year-old daughter.

French World Cup victory voted top international sports story of

1998 &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ France's stunning victory over Brazil in the World
Cup final was the runaway winner as the top international sports
story of 1998 in an worldwide poll of Associated Press subscribers.
	   France also produced the No. 2 story of the year, but this one
provoked more shame than celebration: the doping scandal which
decimated the Tour de France cycling race.
	   More than 100 media outlets from around the world submitted
ballots, selecting their top 10 stories. Points were awarded on a
sliding scale, ranging from 10 for a first-place vote to one for
10th place.
	   The poll was conducted before the scandal over allegations of
bribery in the election of Olympic host cities _ a story which
would have certainly finished high in the balloting.
	   But there was no surprise in the top story.
	   The World Cup triumph by host France, climaxed by a 3-0 victory
over favorite and defending champion Brazil in the final, captured
45 first-place votes and received a massive total of 639 points.
	   Far behind in second with 369 points _ including seven
first-place votes _ was the Tour de France fiasco. The race was
virtually wrecked by a series of arrests, raids and seizures which
uncovered systematic doping among teams and riders.
	   The Tour de France scandal opened the gates to drug revelations
in other sports and served as a catalyst to new global initiatives
to crack down on doping.
	   Italian rider Marco Pantani's victory in the Tour de France was
almost a footnote in the overall picture, finishing 14th in the
poll with 93 points.
	   Finnish driver Mika Hakkinen's Formula One championship,
clinched in a season-ending duel with Michael Schumacher, was voted
the No. 3 story with 289 points. Hakkinen was almost killed in a
crash three years ago.
	   While France's World Cup victory dominated the voting, Brazil's
flop in the final and the mystery surrounding Ronaldo (he suffered
alleged convulsions before the match and was left off the initial
lineup sheet) garnered significant interest, too _ finishing No. 4
with 243 points.
	   In fifth place with 204 points was the sudden death at age 38 of
former Olympic sprint champion and world record-holder Florence
Griffith Joyner. While there was speculation that her death could
be linked to long-term effects of steroid use, doctors ruled that
she died of a seizure unrelated to drugs.
	   Michael Jordan is another American superstar with global appeal,
and his guiding of the Chicago Bulls to a third straight NBA title
and his possible retirement from the game came in sixth with 143
points.
	   Media magnate Rupert Murdoch's dlrs 1 billion bid to buy English
soccer giant Manchester United _ a record price for a sports
franchise _ was No. 7 with 124 points. The deal is still contingent
on the approval of British regulators.
	   The Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, last February _ which were
deemed a great success despite weather problems and the trashing of
dorm rooms by U.S. hockey players _ was No. 8 with 108 points.
	   In ninth place with 105 points is the NBA lockout, which
threatens the entire 1998-99 season.
	   There was a tie for 10th place with 102 points: Pete Sampras'
crowning as the top-ranked men's tennis player for a record sixth
year; and Norwegian cross-country skier Bjorn Dahlie's record of
eight career Winter Olympic gold medals.
	   Among other top-vote getters were the world records set by
distance runners Haile Gebrselassie and Hicham el Guerrouj; the
turmoil in European soccer over a proposed Super League; and Sepp
Blatter's election as FIFA president.

Ex-IOC member says `extravagant gifts, favors' can buy votes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with Mitchell heading probe &QL; 
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A small group of IOC members are willing to turn
over blocks of votes in return for ``extravagant gifts and favors''
from cities seeking to stage the Olympics, the only panel member
ever to quit in an ethics scandal said.
	   Robert Helmick, who resigned from the IOC and as president of
the U.S. Olympic Committee in 1991 amid conflict-of-interest
charges, said Monday that the gifts could range from fur coats to
shopping sprees for members' wives where thousands of dollars were
spent on clothing.
	   Helmick also said that dlrs 5,000-dlrs 10,000 in first-class
airfare for each member and spouse was ``the minimum that's
expected (from a bid city) before they get to the gifts. That's tit
for tat.''
	   And he blamed IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch to failing to
pay enough attention when allegations of corruption first surfaced
10 years ago.
	   ``He has done a lot of great things for the Olympic movement,''
Helmick said. ``But he did not take this seriously or act promptly,
for whatever reason.''
	   Helmick slipped his resignation under Samaranch's door after
former deputy U.S. Attorney General Arthur Burns found the lawyer
from Des Moines, Iowa, ``repeatedly violated conflict-of-interest
provisions of the USOC and created a perception that he was
trafficking on his Olympic positions for the benefit of private
clients.''
	   It remained the greatest ethics scandal in IOC history until
last week, when senior member Marc Hodler said that another
committee member was among four ``agents'' who promised bid cities
blocks of votes in exchange for payments of up to dlrs 5 million.
	   Hodler's comments followed admissions by organizers of Salt Lake
City's 2002 Winter Games that relatives of six IOC members
benefited from a dlrs 400,000 scholarship fund run by the bid
committee. Hodler called the payments bribes, but later said the
bid had been blackmailed.
	   The IOC and the Salt Lake Organizing Committee are investigating
the scholarships and other possible rules violations by the Utah
bid. The USOC is expected to announce its own probe Tuesday, and
has chosen former Senate majority leader George Mitchell to head
the investigation.
	   Like Hodler, Helmick declined to identify any IOC members or bid
committees involved. He said he decided to speak out because the
scandal should not focus on one or two individuals.
	   ``It's the system,'' he said. ``It's people without a
constituency dealing with a lot of money, without checks and
balances. That leads to corruption without the people being
corrupt.''
	   At the point of that corrupt system, Helmick said, ``There are
several IOC members who control blocks of votes who are willing to
deliver them for extravagant gifts and favors.''
	   Bid cities draw up dossiers on all members that include ``their
likes, dislikes and personalities,'' Helmick said. ``That probably
would also include whether their votes are approachable.''
	   Hodler estimated that 5-7 percent of the IOC's 115 members were
open to bribes. Helmick declined to give a figure, but said bid
cities knew which members were susceptible.
	   ``It's a mating game,'' he said. ``Those who don't do it don't
get approached.''
	   Helmick said he never was approached by a bid city offering
enticements during his five years on the IOC.

President-elect of Venezuela vows to comply with oil-cut agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ President-elect Hugo Chavez of Venezuela
pledged Monday to ``fully comply'' with oil production cuts that
his country has agreed to with Mexico and Saudi Arabia but has
never completely honored.
	   Chavez said low world oil prices are a ``serious threat to
Venezuela's already battered budget'' and pledged to ask for
detailed information on oil production from state-owned Petroleos
de Venezuela to ensure compliance.
	   ``Up to now, Venezuela has not fully complied but is prepared to
do so'' within the first few months of 1999, said Chavez, who takes
office Feb. 2.
	   In June, Venezuela pledged to cut 525,000 barrels a day in daily
oil production, but to date has reduced output by only 400,000
barrels.
	   Chavez, a populist and former leftist coup leader, was elected
president Dec. 6.
	   ``We would consider the possibility of extending the
(production) cuts through the rest of the year'' if world oil
prices fail to recover, Chavez said during a news conference at the
residence of Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo.
	   Chavez began a two-day visit to Mexico on Monday, after visiting
several South American nations.
	   The oil-production agreement is part of an attempt by Mexico,
Venezuela and Saudi Arabia to reduce supply on world markets by 2.6
million barrels per day to boost slumping oil prices.
	   Chavez also announced that he would appoint Jorge Giordani, a
relatively unknown academic, as planning minister _ one of the
country's top economic cabinet posts.
	   Giordani, a professor at the Central University of Venezuela,
was suddenly thrust into the limelight when Chavez identified him
as his top economic adviser before the elections and then tapped
him as head of his economic transition after winning.

Israeli parliament votes for early elections

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's parliament has voted overwhelmingly
for early elections, signaling the demise of Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's ailing hard-line government and effectively
freezing for months the already-troubled peace with the
Palestinians.
	   The elections are likely to take place by the end of April. In
addition to Netanyahu and Labor Party leader Ehud Barak, a
half-dozen other figures have indicated they might be interested in
being the next prime minister.
	   The early elections bill given preliminary approval Monday must
pass two more readings, but Netanyahu has said he will not try to
block its final passage.
	   His last-minute appeal for a national unity government was
laughed out of the chamber by the opposition during a session that
was raucous, even for a parliament not famous for its decorum.
	   ``It seems the other side is not interested in unity, and
possibly less interested in peace than in power,'' Netanyahu told
reporters afterward.
	   ``It's a little too late,'' countered Barak, who said the timing
made him question Netanyahu's sincerity.
	   Even members of his Cabinet who backed the survival of his
government were appalled by Netanyahu's national unity proposal.
	   ``The idea of a national unity government presented at the last
moment is really demagoguery,'' Transport Minister Shaul Yahalom
told Israel TV. ``This is serious?''
	   Netanyahu had steadfastly opposed national unity until it became
clear Monday night that he had talked himself into a corner with
his do-or-die proposal to the Knesset: accept conditions for
resuming the peace process, or go to elections.
	   It became increasingly clear last week that some in his
coalition would not endorse his peace policies and were happy to
oust him as well. He infuriated hard-liners when he agreed to the
U.S.-brokered peace accords at Wye River, Maryland, in October.
	   Wye meant further territorial concessions to the Palestinians,
anathema to a small but powerful rump of the right wing that still
claims the entire biblical land of Israel.
	   The Labor party promised him backing from outside the government
as long as he stuck to Wye, but that ended when Netanyahu froze a
scheduled troop withdrawal from 5 percent of the West Bank after a
wave of anti-Israel violence last month.
	   Netanyahu's conditions to the Palestinians for resuming Wye,
presented to the Knesset Monday, included: a renunciation of claims
to statehood and Jerusalem; a confiscation of arms; an end to
violence and incitement to violence; and a renunciation of claims
that Netanyahu had agreed to release Palestinians jailed for
killings.
	   ``An agreement respected only by Israel is without value and
will not bring peace,'' Netanyahu said.
	   The Palestinians say they have complied with Wye.
	   Barak said the freeze in the peace, coupled with Netanyahu's
political maneuvering in recent weeks, undermined faith in his
leadership.
	   ``The test of leadership is action, not whining,'' he told the
parliament.
	   The Knesset rejected Netanyahu's peace policies 56-48, then
voted 81-30 to approve early elections. Netanyahu, slumped in his
seat at the cabinet table, voted in favor, as he had promised he
would do.
	   Arieh Deri, the leader of the small Shas party that is pressing
hardest for national unity, told The Associated Press he would
continue to lobby for Barak-Netanyahu talks.
	   ``I've already started the contacts,'' he said.
	   Barak said the gap between the parties on the peace process made
such approaches useless.
	   ``I don't think it can be covered with by an artificial unity,''
he told the AP.
	   The bill on early elections will go to the law committee, but
the overwhelming vote in the Knesset suggested it will be returned
quickly for its second and third readings. Barak and Netanyahu have
agreed on an April 27 date, Israel radio reported.
	   Both men have reason to fear former chief-of-staff Lt. Gen.
Amnon Lipkin-Shahak. He is expected to announce his retirement from
the military by the end of this week and announce his candidacy at
the head of an as-yet unformed centrist party comprised of
defectors from Labor and the Likud.
	   Polls have suggested that a bid by Shahak would likely push
Barak out of the race in the first round of voting and lead to a
run-off between Netanyahu and Shahak, with Shahak the likely
winner.
	   Little is known of Shahak's policies. As a soldier, he is
prohibited from expressing an opinion. But his deep involvement in
the peace talks suggests he is a moderate who favors territorial
concessions.
	   Others likely to declare their candidacy include hard-liners
such as Benjamin Begin, the son of the late Prime Minister Menachem
Begin, and Limor Livnat, Netanyahu's communications minister.
Livnat's rumored candidacy has troubled ultra-Orthodox legislators
who question a woman's fitness for leadership.
	   Whatever the outcome, the Palestinians still see the government
as bounded by Wye.
	   ``What Netanyahu is doing now is political clowning,''
Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo told AP. He
``has put Israel in a political crisis and has also put the peace
process in crisis.''
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat had asked President Clinton for ``immediate and
active intervention'' to move the process forward.

Former general will be strong challenger to Netanyahu
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Israel-Politics
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The man with a very good shot at becoming
Israel's next prime minister has no party affiliation and has never
uttered a word about politics in public.
	   He is Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, a former armed forces chief-of-staff
whose views on the issues that divide Israel _ Mideast peace and
the secular-religious divide _ can only be guessed at.
	   Still a serving officer in the Israel army, he is barred from
making public statements. But that will change, his associates
said, later this week when he takes his uniform off for good.
	   Critics call Shahak (pronounced SHA-khak) a ``virtual
candidate,'' suggesting he is like a computer-generated concoction
of wishful thinking on the part of Israelis longing for new figure
in Israeli politics.
	   ``Now, his ideas are unknown. But once he decides to run, he
will only lose power,'' said Aliza Goren, an adviser to the Labor
Party leader, Ehud Barak.
	   Maybe. But for months Shahak has consistently led Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu in opinion polls.
	   According to his closest associates, Shahak, 54, has decided to
seek the premiership via an as-yet unformed centrist party. The son
of late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Yuval Rabin, said he would
throw his support and that of his left-wing lobby group behind
Shahak instead of Barak.
	   Asked by Israel TV when he would declare his candidacy, Shahak
said Monday: ``Ultimately, everyone will know what was decided.
Everyone just needs to wait and see.'' Israel TV said he would
leave the army on Thursday and announce his candidacy.
	   During his last years as the head of Israel's army, Shahak
endured a bitter relationship with Netanyahu. In September 1996,
the two came into conflict over Netanyahu's claim that the army
backed his decision to open a new entrance to a tourist tunnel near
Islamic holy sites in Jerusalem's Old City. The opening led to
riots that killed 80 people.
	   And during his waning days as chief-of-staff, Netanyahu
prevented Shahak from delivering a report to the Cabinet on the
Palestinians that the prime minister deemed too political.
	   Barak initially invited Shahak to join Labor, without success.
	   Like Barak and Netanyahu, Shahak is a former commando. A
paratrooper, Shahak led a daring raid that blew up the Democratic
Front headquarters in Beirut in 1973, killing scores of
Palestinians.
	   A protege of Rabin, he led a set of peace negotiations with the
Palestinians, drafting the detailed agreement for an Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   His counterpart then was Nabil Shaath, now the planning minister
in Yasser Arafat's Cabinet. Shaath calls Shahak his ``friend'' and
cites him as an example of the warrior-turned-peace advocate that
the Palestinians want across the bargaining table from them.
	   Shahak's first experience as a diplomat-general was in 1983 when
he commanded Israeli forces around Beirut that got into a turf
dispute with U.S. Marines stationed there as peacekeepers. Shahak
complained the Marines were blocking Israeli attempts to stop
infiltrators and ``behaving like we are their greatest enemy.''
	   Tall and soft-spoken, Shahak is portrayed by his supporters as a
``tough dove'' on security issues. Together with his wife Tali, a
former military correspondent for a left-leaning Israeli newspaper,
he will stress the issues of personal integrity and
straightforwardness, aides say.

IMF says rate cuts have eased threat of global recession
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL;

 &UR; By MARTIN CRUTSINGER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Economics Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Interest rate cuts in the United States and
other industrial countries have eased the threat that the Asian
financial crisis will trigger a global recession, the International
Monetary Fund said in an updated economic outlook.
	   But the 182-nation lending agency still found plenty of things
that could go wrong in the new year ranging from a sudden plunge in
U.S. stock prices or the value of the dollar to the failure of
Japanese authorities to aggressively battle their own country's
worst recession in 50 years.
	   Accordingly, the IMF trimmed its forecast for world growth in
1999 to just 2.2 percent, down by 0.3 percentage point from a
report issued just two months ago.
	   The 2.2 percent performance would match the expected output for
this year and would be the slowest world growth rate since a 1.8
percent increase in 1991, when the United States was emerging from
its last recession.
	   The crisis that began in Thailand in 1997 has spread to a number
of other Asian countries, pushing them into deep recessions and in
August leveled the Russian economy.
	   Russia's announcement that it was defaulting on billions of
dollars in foreign loans sent shockwaves through financial markets
from New York to Buenos Aires and raised the specter that the 40
percent of the globe now in recession would soon be joined by many
other nations.
	   In response, the Federal Reserve Board led the way in cutting
interest rates three times over a seven-week period beginning Sept.
29. That led to a rebound in financial markets and more optimism
about economic prospects.
	   ``The worst of this crisis probably is now behind us,'' said IMF
economist Flemming Larsen. ``But we are not completely out of the
woods.''
	   Larsen said that while those Fed rate cuts were appropriate to
restore confidence to financial markets, the IMF did not believe
the central bank should provide further rate relief when it meets
Tuesday out of concern that more monetary easing could trigger
inflationary pressures in the United States.
	   ``While the danger of a worldwide recession does seem to have
diminished, the supply of funds to most emerging market economies
is still sharply reduced and conditions in financial markets remain
fragile,'' the IMF report said.
	   For the United States, the IMF's updated forecast predicted
growth of 3.6 percent this year, slightly better than the 3.5
percent forecast in October. But the IMF predicted a sharp slowdown
in 1999 with growth of just 1.8 percent, 0.2 percentage point lower
than the October forecast.
	   The IMF predicted that the Japanese economy would shrink by 2.8
percent this year and another 0.5 percent in 1999. The 1999
forecast is a full percentage point below its October assessment
and IMF officials said it would have been even lower if not for
recent Japanese government steps to revive growth and deal with
failing banks.
	   In addition to the threat posed by Japan's recession, the IMF
also expressed worries that developing countries will have
increasing trouble attracting the foreign capital they need as
investors look for less risky opportunities elsewhere.
	   Also listed as threats were the possibility that the U.S. stock
market, which has climbed to new highs after its August swoon,
could be caught in another down draft. That could prompt American
consumers to pull back on their spending. Or the dollar, which has
been weakening, could suddenly dip if foreigners become worried
about the increase in the U.S. trade deficit.
	   The IMF has assembled more than dlrs 100 billion in emergency
loans for Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, Russia and Brazil. But
the agency has come under attack from critics who charge that its
brand of belt-tightening has made the economic recessions in the
crisis countries worse and failed to halt the spread of market
turmoil.
	   Asked about the criticism, IMF chief economist Michael Mussa
noted that financial markets and currencies in Thailand, Indonesia
and South Korea have rebounded in recent weeks, an outcome he said
showed the IMF formula is working.
	   ``Not only have exchange rates appreciated but interest rates
have come down,'' Mussa said. The agency's executive board will
release a formal review next month assessing how it handled the
economic turmoil of this year and last.

The modern, material Christmas makes headway in West Africa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ At the mall, Ivorian mothers pick
among row after row of imported dolls like ``Baby Nurse'' while
piped-in music plays Christmas carols.
	   Outside, young men sell long strands of shimmering gold, green
and red holiday decorations.
	   And in tiny, wooden shops in working-class Abidjan
neighborhoods, shoppers are snapping up racks of blinking lights.
	   Commercialism, American-style, has come to Christmas in West
Africa.
	   From shoppers crowding the Abidjan mall to Nigerian Muslims
buying pine trees, the traditional West African Christmas _ a
relatively quiet day of church, food and a few gifts for the
children _ is slowly giving ground to the modern, material version.
	   ``Christmas is for everyone now,'' said Berte Niamke, laughing
as she pointed out the corner in her Abidjan living room where the
plastic fir tree, the lights, the presents and the wads of cotton
``snow'' will go. ``It's supposed to be for the kids but really
it's now for everyone. Everyone wants a gift.''
	   Niamke, who grew up in a small Ivorian village where Christmas
was little more than a day to go to church, now celebrates in
style. In recent years, she has dressed up as Father Christmas and
handed out gifts to the children.
	   She has no problem with the growing commercialism.
	   Compared to the United States, though, Christmas celebrations
still remain low-key in this part of the world.
	   Particularly outside of urban areas, Christmas still means
family more than anything else.
	   ``This holiday is for our children,'' said Agnes Traore, an
Abidjan fruit seller. ``I don't know why people have to do all this
decorating and giving presents.''
	   Experts say Africa _ with far weaker spending power, a more
restrained commercial culture and ingrained traditions _ won't ever
approach the scale of Western holiday purchasing frenzies.
	   ``Granted, countries like the Ivory Coast might have malls, but
my experience is that the tradition is still more important,'' said
Dr. Frederic Torimiro, a social scientist at Ferrum College in
Virginia, who regularly returns to his home country of Cameroon.
	   Change, though, has come with increased commercialism over the
past few years.
	   Television has brought a barrage of Western images celebrating
the material Christmas, and relatives returning from overseas have
brought similar traditions.
	   There are even a couple of American-style malls scattered across
the region _ complete with bearded Santas and gift-wrapping tables
where shoppers can whip out credit cards like anybody would in New
York or Paris.
	   It's a change, though, that is not always welcomed.
	   ``When we were young, you'd see the elder ones in the family and
others from the village calling family meetings on Christmas Eve.
They'd perform ... traditional rituals, asking for God's
guidance,'' said Kofi Totobi Quakyi, Ghana's minister for state
security, standing in his office decorated with a sea of Christmas
cards.
	   ``Now it's like everybody, including our Muslim brothers and
sisters, are doing one thing: merrymaking,'' he said.
	   Some West Africans now harken for a simpler time.
	   ``You go to town right now, people are so busy shopping and
buying all kinds of stuff,'' said Kwame Busumbru, a Ghanaian
assistant pastor at Abidjan's International Fellowship of
Christians church. ``They're forgetting what Christmas is really
about.''

Dollar higher against yen, Japanese stocks mixed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen in early
trading Monday while Japanese stocks opened mixed following an
overnight rise on Wall Street.
	   The dollar bought 115.90 yen, up 1.00 yen from late Monday in
Tokyo but below its late New York level of 116.21.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 40.63 points,
or 0.29 percent, to 14,112.32. On Monday, the average closed down
41.34 points, or 0.29 percent.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar retreated somewhat
from its New York levels as Japanese exporters took profits in
pre-holiday trading.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices were mixed as the
effect of Monday's gains on Wall Street were offset by concerns
over a continued steep fall in Japanese bond prices.
	   The U.S. market gained strongly Monday as it shrugged off the
impeachment of President Bill Clinton over the weekend, with the
Dow Jones Industrial Average jumping 85.22 points to 8,988.85.
	   In Japan, the Ministry of Finance decided Sunday to issue
government bonds totaling 71.13 trillion yen (dlrs 618.5 billion)
in the fiscal year beginning in April to help pay for a record new
budget.
	   Traders said that such a large issuance of government bonds
would drive long-term interest rates higher. Higher interest rates
tend to discourage stock investors because they raise the cost of
borrowing for companies.
	   Trading remained quiet as many foreign players have already left
for the Christmas holidays, and Japan's financial markets will be
closed Wednesday for a national holiday, traders said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section gained 1.10 points, or 0.10 percent, to 1,100.22. The
TOPIX closed up 2.58 points, or 0.23 percent, on Monday.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.540 percent from Monday's finish of 1.505
percent, driving its price down to 102.15 yen from 102.44 yen.

Dollar higher against yen, Japanese stocks mixed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS day of week in 1st paragraph &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen in early
trading Tuesday while Japanese stocks opened mixed following an
overnight rise on Wall Street.
	   The dollar bought 115.90 yen, up 1.00 yen from late Monday in
Tokyo but below its late New York level of 116.21.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 40.63 points,
or 0.29 percent, to 14,112.32. On Monday, the average closed down
41.34 points, or 0.29 percent.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar retreated somewhat
from its New York levels as Japanese exporters took profits in
pre-holiday trading.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices were mixed as the
effect of Monday's gains on Wall Street were offset by concerns
over a continued steep fall in Japanese bond prices.
	   The U.S. market gained strongly Monday as it shrugged off the
impeachment of President Bill Clinton over the weekend, with the
Dow Jones Industrial Average jumping 85.22 points to 8,988.85.
	   In Japan, the Ministry of Finance decided Sunday to issue
government bonds totaling 71.13 trillion yen (dlrs 618.5 billion)
in the fiscal year beginning in April to help pay for a record new
budget.
	   Traders said that such a large issuance of government bonds
would drive long-term interest rates higher. Higher interest rates
tend to discourage stock investors because they raise the cost of
borrowing for companies.
	   Trading remained quiet as many foreign players have already left
for the Christmas holidays, and Japan's financial markets will be
closed Wednesday for a national holiday, traders said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section gained 1.10 points, or 0.10 percent, to 1,100.22. The
TOPIX closed up 2.58 points, or 0.23 percent, on Monday.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.540 percent from Monday's finish of 1.505
percent, driving its price down to 102.15 yen from 102.44 yen.

Lane retires as boxing referee, wants to be color commentator
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARTIN GRIFFITH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RENO, Nevada (AP) _ The referee whose action led to Mike Tyson's
temporary banishment from boxing for biting Evander Holyfield's ear
is calling it quits.
	   Mills Lane of Reno said Monday that he's ending his 31-year
career as a referee because he wants to devote more time as a
national television boxing analyst.
	   ``It's been a blast, a real helluva ride,'' he said. ``But I
think it would be a conflict of interest to make public comment
(about boxing) and at the same time be an active referee.
	   ``Sure, I'll miss it, but I feel I'm going out on my own terms.
I'm not as good as I was five years ago. You don't hear the bell as
well and move as well when you're 61.''
	   Lane gained international attention in June 1997 when he
disqualified Tyson for biting off a piece of Hollyfield's ear
during a heavyweight championship bout in Las Vegas. It was Lane's
96th title fight.
	   Lane refereed fights involving nearly every boxing great of
recent decades, including Muhammad Ali, Sugar Ray Leonard, Marvin
Hagler, Larry Holmes and Roberto Duran.
	   ``But I'm forever wedded to the Tyson-Hollyfield fight,'' he
said. ``There's no question that bite put me where I am now.''
	   Lane made his national television debut as a color commentator
this year, doing three fights for the FX network. He has no
contract with FX and is open to any offers, he said.
	   Lane, a former Nevada district attorney and district judge, also
is host of a syndicated television series, ``Judge Mills Lane,''
which has been renewed for a second season.
	   Lane said he also would like to be appointed as a member of the
Nevada State Athletic Commission, which regulates boxing in the
state.
	   ``I look forward to doing color commentating, which I have
enjoyed, and to involve myself in other aspects of boxing,'' he
said.
	   His career as a referee began in 1964, but was sidetracked for
three years while he attended law school.

1999: Will world economy plunge into recession?

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Russia is suffering from a virtual collapse of
its economy. Japan is wrestling with its worst recession in 50
years. And recession and unemployment are looming in Brazil, Latin
America's largest economy.
	   An estimated 40 percent of the world currently is in recession,
and economists have lowered growth expectations for 1999.
	   In Europe, 11 nations will merge their monies into a new common
currency, the euro, on Jan. 1.
	   ``E-Day'' is hailed as the greatest step toward European unity
since the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989 and the continent's
biggest financial shakeup since World War II.
	   Europe and the United States, the two motors of the world
economy, will likely spearhead a slight improvement in global
economic fortunes in 1999. But economists warn that economic
weakness is so widespread that the global economy could still slip
into a recession.
	   ``There is still a substantial risk that the world economy will
plunge into recession in 1999,'' the World Bank said in its annual
Global Economic Prospect report.
	   The bank provided two scenarios, and said the more likely is
``sluggish growth'' in the world economy _ around 1.9 percent this
year compared to 3.8 percent in 1997 _ rather than a full-blown
recession, defined as growth in global output of less than 1
percent. The International Monetary Fund predicted world growth of
2.2 percent in 1999.
	   The recession scenario will come into play if Japan's economy
shrinks further, investor anxiety about emerging markets
intensifies, private capital flows to the developing world dry up,
and a large, sustained stock market correction _ 20 percent to 30
percent _ depresses growth in the United States and Europe.
	   ``We can't tell for sure how long this crisis will last, or how
deep it will be,'' said the World Bank's chief economist, Joseph E.
Stiglitz.
	   Japan, the world's second-biggest economy, Brazil, Indonesia,
Russia and 33 other countries in the developing world and the
former Soviet bloc will see a drop in per-capita output this year.
	   Japan's economy shrank at an annual rate of 2.6 percent in the
latest (July-September) quarter, marking a full year of decline and
the deepest recession since World War II, as debt-ridden financial
institutions scaled back on lending, starving companies of cash.
	   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa has expressed doubt the
economy's contraction will be limited to the 1.8 percent the
government forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1999. The
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development predicted
Japan's economy will shrink 2.8 percent in 1998 and grow just 0.2
percent in 1999.
	   The decline in Asia's biggest economy has prolonged and deepened
the economic crisis plaguing neighboring countries from Indonesia
to South Korea.
	   In the Middle East, oil prices scrapping the bottom of the
barrel and weak export markets will undercut the Gulf countries'
ability to provide jobs for populations in which nearly half are
under age 16.
	   Half a world away, it's a brighter picture.
	   The U.S. economy is demonstrating astonishing resilience even
though the Asian slump has dried up demand for American exports.
Unemployment is near 28-year lows of 4.4 percent despite factory
layoffs, and inflation is the best in three decades _ below 2
percent.
	   ``While the global crisis is having an impact _ manufacturers
continue to shed jobs _ the rest of the U.S. economy continues to
barrel forward,'' said economist Mark Zandi of Regional Financial
Associates.
	   Analysts attributed the low unemployment rate to the fact that
workers laid off by manufacturing companies hurt by loss of export
sales are finding employment in service-sector jobs.
	   Economists predict growth in the gross domestic product will
slow to 2.0 percent in 1999, from 3.5 percent anticipated this
year. Most of the economic slowdown is expected to occur in the
first half of 1999 with some recovery seen in the second half.
	   On the downside, the U.S. trade deficit in goods is up 24
percent this year (by November), running at dlrs 246 billion and
administration officials predict it'll soar above dlrs 300 billion
next year.
	   On the other side of the Atlantic, growth across the 11-nation
euro zone will slip to 2.4 percent in 1999, compared to 2.8 in
1998. The German economy, Europe's biggest, will grow 2.7 percent
this year and 2.0 in 1999, according to government forecasts.
	   In the 15-member European Union, the 1999 industrial growth
forecast ranges from 8.2 percent in booming Ireland to 1.3 percent
for Britain.
	   But unemployment remains the burden of most EU governments, and
it will dip only ``marginally'' from 11.8 percent to 11.2 percent
in 1999, European Central Bank chief Wim Duisenberg said.
	   Buffeted by the global crisis in developing economies and the
slump in oil prices, Russia goes into 1999 with the government
struggling to come up with a policy to deal with the country's
worst economic crisis since the Soviet collapse.

NEW YORK: Soviet collapse.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Having effectively defaulted on some of its debts, the
government's only strategy has been to beg for more Western loans.
The government has warned that Russia may plunge into chaos if
there is no new aid.
	   But Western governments and private institutions, having seen
billions of dollars wasted and misappropriated, are reluctant to
extend any more aid.
	   While some assessments project a mild recovery in the second
half of 1999, all projections call for an overall decline in GDP
ranging from 3 percent to 11 percent. Russia's economy is expected
to shrink about 5 percent in 1998.
	   ``In such conditions the crisis can become permanent,'' warned
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, still struggling to implement a
recovery plan.
	   In Latin America, Brazil will pay the price in 1999 for failing
to curb its dlrs 65 billion budget deficit, and a recession
expected here will stunt growth around the continent.
	   Brazil plans to cut its deficit by some dlrs 23 billion (28
billion reals) next year by raising taxes and reducing spending.
The combination will produce a sharp retraction, easing slightly
after July.
	   The more optimistic economists predict Brazil's economy will
shrink 1 percent. J.P. Morgan estimates a contraction of 3 percent
in 1999.
	   With world oil prices hovering at 12-year lows of around dlrs 10
a barrel, the countries of the Middle East _ especially those in
the Gulf that are heavily dependent on oil _ face deepening
economic problems.
	   Iran may have to reschedule its foreign debt, while countries
like Saudi Arabia and Qatar have slashed budgets and will have to
keep a tight rein on spending in 1999.
	   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, is taking the
biggest beating. Analysts estimate its oil income will fall to dlrs
23 billion in 1998 from nearly dlrs 50 billion in 1997.
	   Most of the Gulf countries already have cut spending, frozen
hiring, postponed developments projects and slowed payments to
contractors _ all moves that will have a depressing effect on their
local economies.
	   Israel's economic slowdown, now in its third year, is expected
to continue through 1999. Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman recently
acknowledged that GDP may grow less in 1999 than the ministry's
original forecast of 2.5 percent because of global market turmoil.
	   Unemployment, forecast to swell to more than 9 percent in 1998
from 7.7 percent in 1997, is expected to remain fairly stable
through 1999.
	   Elsewhere:
	   _ China has drastically increased spending and loosened its
inflation-fighting credit policy efforts to protect the country
from the financial turmoil and economic slumps afflicting its
neighbors. By the last quarter of 1998, those efforts appeared to
be paying off, with signs of recovery in industrial output and GDP
growth, which had dipped to 7.2 percent in the first three
quarters, well below the official target of 8.0 percent.
	   _ In Latin America, Argentina will feel the pinch _ 40 percent
of its exports are to Brazil. Argentine economic growth will shrink
to about half this year's 7 percent, barring further turbulence in
Brazil. Chile's boom years also may be over. Growth in 1999 should
be around 3 percent, accelerating in the second half. After growing
by more than 5 percent in 1997, Venezuela's economy is expected to
shrink at least 1 percent in 1998 mainly due to low oil prices.
Mexico has proposed its most austere budget in 20 years, and a
tight money policy to lower 15.7 percent inflation will mean more
sluggish growth.
	   _ South African economy will grow just 0.2 percent in 1998, down
from the 3 percent predicted earlier. The collapse of the
once-booming ``Asian Tigers'' has dampened global demand for
minerals and commodities, especially gold, that South African
exports rely on.

 &UR; Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Europe's great economic adventure
starts midnight on New Year's Eve. By the time champagne corks stop
popping to welcome in 1999, 11 nations will have merged their
monies into a new common currency _ the euro.
	   ``E-Day'' is hailed as the greatest step toward European unity
since the fall of the Iron Curtain and the continent's biggest
financial shakeup since World War II.
	   ``In a few days, we'll enter the Age of the Euro, a major
historic turning point,'' proclaimed Italy's Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema.
	   The euro's immediate significance may be lost on most of the
euro-zone's 270 million people since it will remain largely a
phantom currency until euro coins and banknotes hit the streets in
2002.
	   But for businesses and governments, the euro will be an
immediate reality. On Jan. 4, when bond, stock and money markets
open after the holidays, German marks, French francs and the rest
will have disappeared, replaced by the euro.
	   It will be worth about dlrs 1.16.
	   Big European companies will keep books and conduct business in
euros from day one. They are looking forward to dealing in one
unified market stretching from Spain to Finland, with no exchange
costs or fears of currency fluctuations.
	   Companies should also have better access to capital through a
planned link-up among European stock markets. Firms have initiated
a spate of mergers to compete in an expanded euro-zone market.
	   A European Central Bank, based in Frankfurt, Germany, will set
single interest rates for the whole euro zone. Low-inflation and
deficit policies imposed on euro-zone governments are already
credited for shielding Europe from international financial turmoil.
	   ``The euro-zone is an island of stability,'' said former German
Finance Minister Theo Waigel. ``This is clear proof that this
process has been the right one.'' Despite the impact of Asia's
downturn, the euro-zone economy is forecast to grow 2.8 percent
this year _ 2.4 percent in 1999.
	   Even without euro-cash, consumers will find it easier to spot
cross-border bargains as prices are posted in euros. Banks will
offer euro accounts and credit-card shoppers can use the new money.
	   Doubts remain however. Many question if a single currency will
work for economies as diverse as Portugal and Germany, or wonder
how the euro will stand up in world markets alongside the dollar.
Others ask if companies and consumers are ready for the euro. Some
predict computer or accounting chaos.
	   The European Central Bank, facing pressure from left-leaning
governments, has recently lowered interest rates to help boost
economic growth and fight unemployment _ a stubborn 10.9 percent in
the euro zone. Euroland governments also are looking at how far
they have to dovetail economic policies, notably taxation.
	   The 11 countries launching the euro are Austria, Belgium,
Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Spain and Portugal.

Asia may have seen the worst, but troubles aren't over
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With FEA-1998-World Economy &QL; 
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asia's slumping economies may have hit bottom,
but they are unlikely to rebound much anytime soon, say analysts.
	   ``This is the bottom, but it's a deep bottom,'' said Andy Xie,
senior economist at investment bank Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong.
``The worst days are behind us, but next year won't be much
better.''
	   Hong Kong is one of the economies expected to shrink even
further in the new year. Financial Secretary Donald Tsang pointedly
warned residents they must ``cross a psychological barrier'' to
ride out the storm.
	   It's a barrier many regional neighbors crashed through in 1998
as the crisis swept country after country, wiping out businesses
and jobs, choking off investment, battering stock markets and
currencies, while creating a climate of financial fear.
	   But stock markets recently have shown signs of stability,
currencies have stopped their freefall and Asia heads into the new
year with a couple of huge questions: Have economies bottomed out,
and if so, when can they improve?
	   ``The worst is probably behind Asia in a regional sense,'' said
Russell Jones, the chief Asia economist in Tokyo for investment
bank Lehman Brothers. ``That is to say the huge contractions that
you saw straight across Asia in 1998 aren't going to repeat in
1999. But any recovery is going to be quite tentative. It's a very
uncertain environment.
	   ``Some countries are not going to recover for some time. One is
Japan, the biggest economy in the region.''
	   Japan has long been considered Asia's growth engine, but at
least in the near term it's likely to keep sputtering through the
nation's worst recession since World War II.
	   Economist Anthony Chan at HSBC Securities says some economies _
Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan _ are suffering from cyclical
slowdowns, while many others have been devastated by broad
structural troubles that will be much tougher to fix.
	   ``Forget about Indonesia and forget about Malaysia in 1999,''
Chan said.
	   The crisis is raising some questions that might stump the
experts.
	   For years, governments around the world have sought to keep
inflation under control but the current troubles have seen the
emergence of an opposite phenomenon _ deflation, or falling prices
_ that has few precedents in modern economic history.
	   Lower prices might sound good to consumers with cash in their
pockets, but a sustained bout of deflation represents serious
illness in the economy. In a deflationary spiral, prices would
tumble not only for food and clothing, but also for stocks, houses
and other assets.
	   ``The dynamics of it could take us to places where we didn't
expect to go,'' Jones said.
	   Some experts express concerns about China, where any new
troubles could deepen Hong Kong's economic mess and spread further
gloom through the region. Others play down fears about China,
though they say much of its economic growth is unsound, based on
government spending on the infrastructure.
	   ``In the short term, it will produce growth, but the quality of
the growth remains a concern,'' said Raphael Wu, an economist at
Warburg Dillon Read in Hong Kong.

With `electronic ink,' a printed page can be a work in progress

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ What if these words disappeared tonight, and a
different story filled this space tomorrow morning? What if that
book on your table told a different tale next week?
	   And what if your favorite hiking jacket had an ever-changing map
on the sleeve _ with a moving dot to tell you where you are?
	   These are the kinds of things researchers and marketers talk
about when they ponder electronic ink.
	   Like regular ink, it's printed on an ordinary surface. But, like
a chameleon, it can change the patterns it shows. And that's
attracting the attention of some major publishers, advertising
executives and retailers.
	   After all, electronic ink means never having to say you're
finished. There's no final edition of an electronic newspaper; it
just updates its stories. If a store's sign is advertising picnic
supplies when dark clouds roll in, it can switch to touting
umbrellas.
	   This may sound futuristic, but a company called E Ink of
Cambridge, Massachusetts, hopes to start marketing changeable signs
next year. With letters 2 inches (5 centimeters) to 4 feet (122
centimeters) tall, signs would cost dlrs 100 to dlrs 5,000,
depending on the number of letters to be displayed, says E Ink vice
president Russ Wilcox.
	   Books and newspapers that can change their contents would come
later, he says. Maybe four to five years from now.
	   Electronic ink isn't the only high-tech way to post information,
of course. Some hotels already use indoor changeable signs somewhat
like the liquid-crystal displays on electronic calculators.
	   And for years, scientists have studied an array of very tiny
balls, half black and half white, embedded in a surface. The balls
rotate on command, each showing the black or white surface, and the
eye blends all these tiny dots into an image.
	   The E Ink approach draws on research by Joseph Jacobson and
colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It too
uses tiny dots, but they are transparent spheres in the ink itself
and only about the width of a human hair.
	   Inside each sphere is a bunch of tiny particles in a dye. These
particles dash from one side of the sphere to the other when
they're exposed to an electric charge.
	   Say the particles are white and the dye is black. If the
particles are hidden by the dye, the sphere looks black. But when
the particles hustle toward you, crowding against the near side of
the transparent spheres like children's noses at a candy store
window, the sphere turns white.
	   By controlling that movement sphere by sphere, scientists can
change the image on a sign or a printed page. The electric charge
that moves the particles comes from two arrays of transparent
electrodes, one on each side of the ink layer.
	   Black and white won't be the only options. E Ink says it will be
able to provide a range of colors.
	   J.C. Penney Co. Inc. is eager to start testing the signs, says
Edward Sample, the retailer's manager of systems support and
technology. He already has seen a prototype that changed from blank
to the words ``J.C. Penney'' and back.
	   He looks forward to printed signs that present eye-catching
moving messages or count down the days to the arrival of a new line
of sportswear.
	   From his many years behind the sales counter, Sample also
appreciates the value of a sign that advertises different things at
different times: hosiery and cosmetics for emergency shoppers on a
lunch hour, and a coordinated outfit or fragrances for more
leisurely shoppers in the evening.
	   Why not just have employees change regular signs? Because,
Sample says, that would take them away from their main job of
helping customers.
	   Back home, those customers may someday read books with
ever-changing stories. Once they finished ``The Red Badge of
Courage,'' they could plug into the Internet and replace Stephen
Crane with Stephen King. Pages might include animation or even
video clips; users could adjust the type size and style as they
wish.
	   Electronic books are on the market, but they present words on
screens. People might prefer to read on paper, says Kenneth
Bronfin, senior vice president at the Hearst Corp.'s new-media
group. Hearst, which publishes books, newspapers and magazines, is
among companies that invested a total of dlrs 15.8 million in E Ink
this year.
	   ``This is something people can curl up in bed with, whereas they
won't curl up in bed with a device that looks like a computer and
has glass and plastic and batteries,'' Bronfin says. ``This is a
device that will actually look and feel a lot like a book.''
	   Similarly, people might buy one electronic newspaper of perhaps
24 pages and simply update the pages with new stories by computer
or radio transmission.
	   Some observers, however, question just how popular electronic
ink will be.
	   Aris Silzars, president-elect of the Society for Information
Display, is skeptical that it would spread beyond specialized uses
like books that give portable access to staggering amounts of
reference material. In that case, he says, some people might prefer
a book to a laptop computer with CD-ROM.
	   For books in general, Silzars questions whether an
electronic-ink version would be handy, durable and inexpensive
enough to lure people away from traditional print.

Scottish town again consoles the families of Pan Am Flight 103

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOCKERBIE, Scotland (AP) _ The tiny southern Scottish town where
Pan Am Flight 103 plunged from the sky 10 years ago Monday again
opened its arms to the families of those who perished, people
``whom fate and circumstance conspired to bring together.''
	   ``In the lives that were lost, some very young, there was
meaning and achievement,'' said the Rev. David M. Almond at a
moving evening service at Dryfesdale Parish Church. ``Our task is
to continue that meaning and build on that achievement.''
	   Lockerbie lost 11 of its own residents along with the 259
passengers and crew on Flight 103, a New York-bound jet that was
blown apart 42 minutes after takeoff from London's Heathrow
Airport. A high explosive hidden in a radio cassette player tore
through the aircraft just as it reached its cruising altitude of
31,000 feet (9,400 kms).
	   Quiet sobs echoed through the century-old church Monday as a
moment of silence was observed at 7:03 p.m. (1903 GMT), the precise
time the jet exploded. Then the lament of a lone bagpiper rang out
as the 600 worshipers, including 60 out-of-town relatives and
friends of the victims, stood with heads bowed.
	   ``This was a very positive, emotional day,'' said Bert Ammerman,
of River Vale, New Jersey, whose brother Thomas was killed in the
bombing.
	   The church service and an earlier ceremony at the Dryfesdale
Cemetery, during which Prince Philip, the queen's husband, laid a
wreath, demonstrated once again the goodwill of the people of
Lockerbie and the surrounding area, he said.
	   ``These people have proven over the past 10 years that good
intentions can overcome evil,'' Ammerman said.
	   As freezing rain fell on the cemetery, Rev. Patrick Keegans,
parish priest at the time of the tragedy, spoke of another ticking
bomb, ``the irresistible bomb of justice and truth.''
	   ``Know this,'' he said, addressing those who perished, ``that
our wreath laying today is not a symbolic gesture. It is a
declaration that we will not rest until we have justice and truth,
until all responsible for your deaths are held accountable.''
	   That time probably won't come soon. Libya has sent mixed signals
about whether it will hand over the two suspects charged in the
bombing to face trial in the Netherlands by a Scottish court.
	   Libya's parliament gave its conditional approval last week for
the Anglo-American proposal, but said some obstacles remained. And
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi cast further doubt when he said in an
interview aired Monday on the Dutch current affairs program 2
Vandaag that he wants an international panel of judges _ rather
than the Scottish judges that the United States and Britain insist
upon_ to try the Libyans ``because that is independent.'' The panel
should include judges from the United States, Britain and Libya, he
said.
	   The United States and Britain said that they won't compromise
further, and their patience is running out.
	   In a separate service in London's Westminster Abbey, attended by
Prime Minister Tony Blair, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and Prince
Andrew, the second son of Queen Elizabeth II, hundreds listened as
one-by-one the names of the dead were read aloud. For each name
read, a candle was lit in remembrance.
	   Simultaneous services were also held at Arlington National
Cemetery in Virginia and in Syracuse, New York, which lost 35
college students in the crash. Each service began at 7:03 p.m.
(1903 GMT), the moment when the plane disappeared from the radar
screen above Scotland.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A fire broke out at the local Chinese army
headquarters Tuesday morning but firefighters extinguished the
blaze an hour later.
	   The fire, which started around 7:30 a.m. (2330 GMT), affected
three units on the 26th and 28th floors of the People's Liberation
Army headquarters in Hong Kong's Central district, a government
statement said.
	   There were no initial reports of casualties.
	   The cause of the fire was being investigated, a spokesman for
the army said.
	   About 4,700 Chinese troops have been stationed in Hong Kong
since the territory was returned to Chinese rule from Britain in
July 1997.

Butler says UNSCOM future up to Security Council
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ It was up to the U.N. Security
Council, not the Iraqi government, to decide the future of the U.N.
weapons inspection commission, chief inspector Richard Butler said
Tuesday.
	   Butler, who also said there was no reason to quit his post, was
responding to comments by Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
that the commission, known as UNSCOM, is dead.
	   ``It's not for Baghdad alone to make that declaration,'' Butler
told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   ``Of course their cooperation is fairly essential, but the
weapons inspection and the Special Commission are the creation of
the Security Council and the Security Council has a certain amount
of say over these things.''
	   The 15-member council will meet in New York on Tuesday in an
effort to bridge a split over how to disarm Iraq, following a
four-day bombing campaign by the United States and Britain.
	   The United States and Britain want UNSCOM to continue trying to
verify the destruction of Iraq's biological and chemical weapons
and its long-range missiles.
	   And they support Butler, whose report last week concluding that
Iraq failed to cooperate fully with U.N. weapons inspectors
triggered the U.S. and British bombing.
	   Others, including the most vocal opponents of the bombing,
Russia and China, have called for the lifting of sanctions on Iraq
and Butler's ouster.
	   Butler said the fundamental issue behind the bombing was
``Iraq's absolute refusal'' to cooperate with the commission.
	   ``It (Iraq) was put under a warning for one month that it must
keep its promise of full cooperation made when President Clinton
pulled back bombing a month ago,'' Butler said.
	   ``That did . . . cause quite a ruction within the Security
Council, but I think the Security Council is going to mend that now
and come up with a new approach to dealing with this problem of
Iraq, but one which will still be designed to see it gets
disarmed.''
	   Butler said he expected to remain at UNSCOM.
	   ``Shooting the messenger isn't appropriate, but the temperatures
are coming down as people focus on getting the job done in a new
way,'' Butler said.
	   ``There's no reason why I should resign.''

Serb police crack down on ethnic Albanian town after officer is

<TEXT>
	   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police carried out a sweep of a
Kosovo Albanian stronghold in retaliation for the killing of one of
their officers in escalating violence that has increased fear of a
return to all-out war in the troubled province.
	   The events occurred as Sadako Ogata, the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees, toured the province Monday to get a firsthand look at
the people on both sides of the ethnic conflict who have been
displaced in past fighting.
	   Ogata then headed for Belgrade for a possible meeting Tuesday
with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosovic.
	   In Belgrade on Monday, heads of Yugoslavia's Serb-led army met
with NATO's top commander in Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark, who
repeated warnings that the alliance might intervene if fighting
between Serb security forces and ethnic Albanian rebels continues,
sources close to the talks said on condition of anonymity.
	   Milosevic averted threatened NATO airstrikes when he signed a
U.S.-sponsored deal last October, promising an end to the military
campaign against separatists in the overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian
province of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   The government-run Media Center reported that a 52-year-old Serb
policeman, Milic Jovic, was killed early Monday by unknown
assailants in Podujevo, 25 miles (40 kilometers) north Pristina. A
woman accompanying Jovic was wounded in the leg, the center said.
	   Podujevo is an overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian town near central
Serbia. Tensions there have risen in past weeks as local Serbs
complained of a growing guerrilla presence and demanded the
government protect them.
	   The town was sealed off while Serb police brought in
reinforcements, said the Kosovo Information Center, which is close
to the ethnic Albanian leadership. Sporadic shooting could be heard
from an area northeast of the town, the center said.
	   Hysen Fazliu, a spokesman for the main ethnic Albanian party in
Podujevo, said the Serbian forces clashed with the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army and that an unspecified number of ethnic Albanians
had been arrested.
	   The KLA spokesman in the Podujevo region, Luizim Oraca, said the
clash lasted two hours and that the ``enemy was forced to withdraw,
and one of their tanks was destroyed.'' The report could not be
independently confirmed.
	   Jovic's killing is the latest in a series of setbacks for
Kosovo's fragile truce. It is certain to enrage the Serbs, already
furious over last week's killings of six Serb youths in a Kosovo
bar and of a prominent Serb official.
	   The attack on Jovic also heightens fears that violence in Kosovo
is moving from the rugged countryside to the towns.
	   Ogata, accompanied by the William Walker, the American head of
peace monitors in Kosovo, visited a part of the ethnic Albanian
majority Serbian province where both Serbs and ethnic Albanians
have been displaced.
	   Part of her trip Monday took her to recent refugees' dwellings
without electricity, running water or other basics.
	   In the central Kosovo town of Malisevo, a former KLA stronghold
retaken by Serb police and largely deserted by its ethnic Albanian
population, Ogata was told by ethnic Albanians that they would not
return to their homes as long as police were present.
	   Later, Ogata heard Serb demands to help in the search for over a
hundred Serb civilians missing in rebel territory since July.
	   ``All I have to say is that a political agreement and peace can
solve your problems,'' Ogata said. ``Then you will be able to
return to your homes and live together.''

Oh my, O'Meara: Two majors highlight year in golf
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ Mark O'Meara is no longer just the
middle-age man who lives next door.
	   Graying around the edges, slightly balding on the top, O'Meara
did not fit the prototype of the new face of golf in 1998. He was a
career grinder, with 14 wins in 18 years. His contribution to the
game was thought to be merely a steady influence on his neighbor,
Tiger Woods.
	   Meet the new bully of Isleworth, the central Florida home to the
golf stars where O'Meara was often overlooked by young guns such as
Woods and Ernie Els.
	   When O'Meara raised his arms in victory after sinking a 20-foot
(6-meter) birdie putt on the 72nd hole of the Masters, it was
considered a nice reward for a nice player who had enjoyed a nice
career.
	   Three months later, when O'Meara won the British Open in a
playoff and raised the claret jug for the world to see, he became a
champion no one could overlook.
	   ``It's just an incredible feeling to have two major
championships in a year,'' O'Meara said. ``If I could put my finger
on it, I'd have done it earlier in my career. I think it's just a
little bit of experience, and a little bit of wisdom, and that
usually comes with age.''
	   The year in golf was indeed one for the ages.
	   While the 41-year-old O'Meara became the oldest player ever to
win two majors in one year, his feat was matched on the LPGA Tour
by a 20-year-old rookie from South Korea.
	   Twenty years after Nancy Lopez had perhaps the greatest rookie
season in golf, Se Ri Pak put women's golf on the front page by
winning the LPGA Championship, the U.S. Open in a 20-hole playoff
and then setting an LPGA scoring record.
	   Pak wasn't the only snapshot of youth.
	   Who can forget amateur Matt Kuchar smiling during the Sunday
pressure of Augusta National and the U.S. Open? Or Justin Rose, the
English teen-ager who rejoiced after his birdie chip-in on the last
hole to finish tied for fourth in the British Open? Or the shock on
the face of Jenny Chausiriporn, hand cupped over mouth, as her
45-foot (13.5-meter) birdie putt disappeared into the hole to force
the playoff against Pak in the U.S. Open?
	   Woods, meanwhile, had to settle for consistency instead of major
championships.
	   A year after his record-setting win in the Masters raised
expectations out of this world, the ``Future of Golf'' was put on
hold. Woods won in Dubai and Atlanta, but that was about it.
	   Winning a major in 1998 required experience, not to mention a
little luck.
	   Lee Janzen's wayward tee shot fell out of a tree at The Olympic
Club just when all seemed to be lost. He went on to his second U.S.
Open title, helped also when Payne Stewart's perfect drive landed
in a divot. Vijay Singh had a ball ricochet through the many trees
of Sahalee in the final round of his victory in the PGA
Championship.
	   Even O'Meara caught a break at Royal Birkdale when a spectator
not only found his ball in the third round, but picked it up _
giving O'Meara a free drop.
	   Tom Watson won again on the PGA Tour at 48 but also missed the
cut in all four majors for the first time. Jack Nicklaus made
another Sunday charge at Augusta National at 58, then hobbled away
from the game with an ailing hip and ended his Ripkenlike streak of
146 consecutive majors.
	   Casey Martin hobbled into history. Because of a rare circulatory
disease in his right leg, Martin won his federal lawsuit against
the PGA Tour for a right to use a cart. He also won outside the
courtroom _ first in the Nike Lakeland Classic, then a spot in the
U.S. Open, where he tied for 23rd.
	   Meanwhile, Greg Norman was spending his summer away from golf
recovering from shoulder surgery in April. Norman missed most of
the PGA Tour season and the last three majors, but returned in time
to help the international team win the Presidents Cup at Royal
Melbourne, handing the United States its worst loss ever in a cup.
	   The real drama in match play took place at Muirfield Village,
where Dottie Pepper infuriated Europe with her cheerleading and led
the underdog Americans to a victory in the Solheim Cup. Across the
pond at the World Match Play Championship in Wentworth, England,
the old guy showed up again.
	   O'Meara gave Singh the worst beating ever in the 35-year event,
11 and 10, then rallied over the back nine to beat Woods 1-up with
a final-hole birdie putt from the fringe.
	   Youth did not disappear. Justin Leonard won The Players
Championship, Phil Mickelson won two more tournaments _ he has 13
wins at age 28, none of them a major _ and David Duval emerged as
perhaps the most feared player in golf. Duval won four times, led
the PGA Tour in scoring average and earned a record dlrs 2.59
million.
	   Hale Irwin felt young again on the Senior Tour, winning seven
times, dlrs 2.86 million and setting a record for scoring average
at 68.59. He was the overwhelming player of the year on the Senior
Tour, while Annika Sorenstam beat Pak for the LPGA award, which was
based on points.
	   Duval won twice as many tournaments as anyone else on the PGA,
which gave players something to consider when they voted for their
player of the year. The vote went to O'Meara, who had a year no one
will soon forget.

Dollar higher against yen, Japanese stocks fall
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late morning stock, currency and bond prices &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen Tuesday
morning following gains on Wall Street while Japanese stocks fell
amid concern about the effect of tumbling bond prices on bank
earnings.
	   The dollar bought 115.88 yen as of late morning in Tokyo, up
0.98 yen from late Monday here but below its late New York level of
116.21 yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped 141.71
points, or 1.00 percent, to 14,011.24 at the close of the morning
session. On Monday, the average closed down 41.34 points, or 0.29
percent.
	   The dollar retreated somewhat from its New York levels as
Japanese exporters took profits by selling some of their dollar
holdings, traders said.
	   Activity was thin ahead of the holiday season.
	   The dollar rebounded against the Japanese currency overnight in
New York as President Bill Clinton's continued high popularity
ratings helped markets there shrug off concern about Congress'
impeachment proceedings. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped
85.22 points to 8,988.85.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index
of all issues listed on the first section lost 4.82 points, or 0.44
percent, to 1,094.30. The TOPIX closed up 2.58 points, or 0.23
percent, on Monday.
	   Share prices fell as declines in the bond market were seen
hurting one of the few profitable operations at Japan's ailing
banks: their bond trading desks.
	   A prolonged downturn in particular would spell real trouble for
Japanese lenders, said Yushiro Ikuyo, bank analyst at Commerz
Securities in Tokyo.
	   Prices of the most widely watched bond in Japan, the No. 203
10-year Japanese government bond, tumbled to 101.85 yen from
Monday's close of 102.44. That drove up the yield _ which moves in
the opposite direction of the price _ to 1.575 percent from 1.505
percent.
	   Yields are up from historical lows of 0.695 percent just two
months ago.
	   Investors are worried that new bond issues by the Japanese
government to pay for fiscal stimulus spending will cause a glut in
the market, traders said.
	   Making matters worse, investors have been spooked by reports one
of the market's biggest participants, the Ministry of Finance's
trust bureau, may curtail purchases.

Eight grand slam singles winners in '98 free-for-all
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Parity ruled tennis in 1998, a year when eight
players captured grand slam singles titles _ four for the first
time _ and a few stalwarts of the old guard withstood the
challenges of feisty young upstarts.
	   In the end, Pete Sampras secured the men's No. 1 ranking for a
record sixth straight year, a feat he can't imagine anyone else
matching, and Lindsay Davenport grabbed the women's top spot for
the first time.
	   ``I know what it takes,'' Sampras said of his long reign. ``I
really don't see anyone in today's game having the consistency,
having the durability that it takes to be No. 1 six years. That is
the majority of a career. You need the game, you need the heart,
you need the mind. Some guys have two of the three. Some guys have
a little bit of the three. In order to do it for six years, you
need everything.''
	   The competition is so fierce in tennis these days, with anyone
in the top 100 capable of beating anyone else, Sampras said, that
it would take an extraordinary player to come along and do what he
has done.
	   ``Maybe when I'm done playing, or when I'm 56 years old, there
might be somebody able to do it,'' he said.
	   The depth of the game on the men's and women's tours was evident
from the start of the year to the finish.
	   Along the way, it was a free-for-all. Scissor-kicking
30-year-old Petr Korda won his first major at the Australian Open,
where Martina Hingis briefly continued her one-year dominance of
the women's tour.
	   Spain's Carlos Moya notched his first big title at the French
Open, while compatriot Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario proved she's not
quite ready for retirement at 26 as she won for the third time at
Roland Garros.
	   At Wimbledon, Sampras won for the fifth time in six years to
gain his 11th major title, and 29-year-old Jana Novotna finally
delivered more smiles than tears in her third shot at the
championship.
	   When the U.S. Open rolled around, Patrick Rafter proved his '97
victory was no fluke, and Davenport produced the most solid
performance of her six-year career to win her first major.
	   Yet beyond the diversity of all those grand slam champions,
there were others who filled out the year with grand moments, great
challenges and promises for the future.
	   Monica Seles, once indomitable before tragedies and injuries
took their toll, came tantalizingly close to a fairy-tale triumph
in France just three weeks after her father-coach, Karolj, died of
cancer. The crowd and virtually the whole tennis world was pulling
for Seles, and even Sanchez-Vicario, who beat her in their
three-set final, would have been happy to see her opponent win.
	   Steffi Graf made a fitful return to the game at Wimbledon after
a yearlong absence due to injuries and cried when she spoke of how
she had briefly considered retirement. And though the 29-year-old
Fraulein Forehand never quite overcame her rustiness, she sparkled
at times and showed she might have another major or two left in her
if she can stay healthy.
	   Venus Williams started off the year boasting that she would be
No. 1 by the end. She finished a respectable No. 5, and would
surprise no one if she delivered on her promise this year. Her
younger sister, Serena, didn't develop quite as much, but remains a
threat at No. 20.
	   On the men's tour, Marcelo Rios made his mark, reaching his
first major final at the Australian, ascending to the No. 1 spot
for a total of six weeks, and finishing No. 2 with seven titles in
eight finals. The Chilean became the first South African to rank
No. 1 in the 25-year history of the ATP rankings.
	   Spain's Alex Corretja, who lost to compatriot Moya in the French
final, closed out the year by taking the ATP Tour World
Championship in Germany to finish No. 3 in the rankings. A winner
on carpet, clay and hard courts this year, with five titles in
seven finals, Corretja had the highest season-ending ranking of any
Spaniard in ATP history.
	   Andre Agassi never got beyond the fourth round of a major during
the year, but he worked his way back into playing shape with the
biggest one-year jump into the Top 10 in ATP history by climbing
from No. 122 to No. 6. He led the tour with 10 finals, won half of
those, and equaled Rios for the tour lead with 68 match wins.

Iraq: U.S. bombing destroyed missile plants, killed 62 soldiers

inspector &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi officials say that U.S.-British
airstrikes killed 62 soldiers, demolished key missile factories and
severed phone lines, but insist that the attacks have failed to
seriously harm the military or government.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Monday that civilian
casualties were ``much, much higher'' than the military toll but
refused to give details. Iraq earlier said that 42 people were
killed in the four-night barrage, which was suspended early Sunday.
	   The attacks targeted key military bases, government buildings,
communication centers and factories that could be used to
manufacture weapons of mass destruction. The strikes were launched
after Iraq refused to allow U.N. weapons inspectors into certain
sites.
	   In Washington, U.S. Marine Corps Gen. Anthony Zinni said the
strikes hit 85 percent of their targets, 74 percent of them
successfully. He said a damage assessment from the series of cruise
missile and bombing attacks is still continuing and would probably
take a few more days.
	   Zinni, commander of Central Command which oversees U.S. military
operations in the Middle East, said the United States will maintain
a presence in the Persian Gulf to protect its interests.
	   ``I think U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf, based on all those
leaders I speak to there, are a force of stability in the region,''
he said.
	   Zinni also said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein remains a danger.
``I think those in the region view him as a threat, and those in
the region appreciate us being there providing a counter and a
deterrence to that threat.''
	   U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen said the strike delayed
Iraq's development of ballistic missiles by at least a year and
diminished its overall ability to attack its neighbors.
	   Cohen also reiterated his warning to Iraq that the United States
is prepared to act should Saddam pose a threat to his neighbors.
	   Iraq said that in addition to hitting missile factories, the
bombardments struck colleges, post offices, dormitories, a museum
and an oil refinery.
	   ``They want to ... strip Iraq of any serious industrial
capabilities,'' Aziz said. ``This is a policy of hatred.''
	   But he contended that the United States and Britain failed to
seriously harm the Iraqi government or military.
	   ``They boasted of great success. ... They lied,'' Aziz said at a
news conference in Baghdad, the Iraqi capital.
	   Iraqi authorities have not taken foreign journalists to sites
where they say there were significant civilian casualties as they
have in the past _ a likely indication that civilian casualties
either were not high or were scattered.
	   In London, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the airstrikes
have set back parts of Iraq's ``military infrastructure several
years.''
	   A spokesman for Blair, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the targets included 20 command and control facilities and nine
sites linked to the Republican Guard, the country's elite fighting
force and a main target of the attacks.
	   Aziz said the Republican Guard lost 20 soldiers, and that 18
soldiers of the Special Republican Guard and 24 soldiers in other
branches of the military were also killed. A total of 180 soldiers
were injured, he said.
	   The attacks also heavily damaged factories that could be used to
produce weapons of mass destruction or long-range missiles.
	   Iraqi officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
speed of the attacks took them by surprise and that workers did not
have enough time to remove crucial equipment.
	   The United States and Britain began the attacks shortly after
chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler accused Iraq of failing
to fully cooperate with the inspectors _ who are responsible for
dismantling Iraq's programs to build chemical, biological or
nuclear weapons.
	   The weapons inspectors must certify that Iraq is free of banned
weapons before the U.N. Security Council will lift economic
sanctions imposed on Baghdad for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Aziz reiterated Monday that Baghdad will not allow the monitors
to return.
	   ``The weapons inspectors were killed by the American missiles,''
he said. ``I cannot give them another life.''
	   But Butler said it is up to the Security Council, not the Iraqi
government, to decide the future of the weapons inspectors.
	   ``It's not for Baghdad alone to make that declaration,'' Butler
told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio on Tuesday.
	   Appearing on CNN's ``Larry King Live,'' Butler said he hoped
Iraq would change its mind and resume cooperation with his
commission.
	   He said he had no plans to step down and he didn't think the
``question of personality should be taken any further.
	   ``There are far more substantial things to deal with,'' he said.

Bosnia's nationalists argue over Jewish relic

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ After carving up Bosnia's
territory, the rival ethnic groups are now fighting over one of the
country's cultural treasures _ a 600-year-old Jewish holy book.
	   The Sarajevo Haggadah, handwritten on bleached calf-skin, dates
back to the once-thriving Jewish community in Spain. A Haggadah
tells the story of the exodus of the Jews from ancient Egypt, and
Jews recite from the book during the Passover holiday.
	   The 109-page Sarajevo Haggadah was carried to Italy in 1492
after King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain expelled the
country's Jews. It was brought to Bosnia by a rabbi and handed down
through his family until a descendant, Joseph Kohen, sold it to the
National Museum in 1894.
	   As such, the priceless manuscript belongs to the government of
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
	   The 1995 Dayton peace agreement, however, effectively
partitioned the country along ethnic lines _ Serb, Muslim and
Croat.
	   Now the Bosnian Serbs are demanding one-third ownership of the
Sarajevo Haggadah and are insisting that it be exhibited in Banja
Luka, capital of their mini-state, every third year.
	   In principle, the manuscript would also be exhibited every third
year in Mostar, the unofficial Bosnian Croat capital. The Muslims
would prefer the Haggadah be kept in what had been its traditional
home _ the National Museum in Sarajevo.
	   But the National Museum was heavily damaged during the wartime
siege of Sarajevo, and the bullet-scarred Austro-Hungarian era
structure has not been rebuilt. For now, the manuscript is kept in
the vault of the National Bank.
	   Jakob Finci, the head of Sarajevo's Jewish Community, wants the
manuscript to remain in the national capital. Finci says Bosnian
Serb and Bosnian Croat nationalists have a record of destroying
cultural and religious monuments of rival groups during the
1992-1995 Bosnian war.
	   ``They (the Serbs) blew up the Ferhadija, the others (the
Croats) blew up the Old Bridge,'' Finci said, referring to an
ancient mosque in Banja Luka and the world renown Ottoman bridge in
Mostar, which were both more than 400 years old.
	   ``Bosnia's body is our common history. But they are now building
_ let me use a Jewish expression _ three ghettos,'' he said
bitterly. While Western Europe is moving rapidly toward unity,
``only we are going in the other direction,'' he said.
	   The Sarajevo Haggadah has become a symbol of Bosnia's long
struggle against the forces of religious, cultural and ethnic
division.
	   During World War II, when the city was occupied by German
troops, a Nazi general demanded that the National Museum surrender
the manuscript. A museum director, a Catholic Croat, and the Muslim
curator lied, telling the general another German officer had
confiscated the manuscript that morning.
	   The curator then wrapped the Haggadah in newspapers and
delivered it to a Muslim preacher who lived deep in the Bosnian
mountains. The preacher buried the Haggadah under the doorstep of
the village mosque until the end of the war.
	   In 1992, when Bosnian Serbs began shelling Sarajevo, the
museum's Muslim director, Enver Imamovic, and three volunteers
braved shell and sniper fire to enter the museum. With the help of
a Bosnian Serb, they broke into the museum vault, removed the
Haggadah and brought it to the National Bank, where it has been
kept ever since.
	   Although foreign donors and the joint Muslim, Serb and Croat
parliament have made funds available to reconstruct hotels, shops
and government buildings, money has not been provided for the
National Museum.
	   ``Now, everybody wants his own museum and because of it, it's a
shame, but all museums in this city are closed,'' Finci said.
	   ``The Haggadah is proof of the multi-ethnicity in Bosnia,''
Finci said. ``It is a testament that even in worst of times other's
values were not destroyed.''

<TEXT>
	   GREENSBORO, North Carolina (AP) _ Jason Woolley had a goal and
two assists and Dominik Hasek made 19 saves to lead the Buffalo
Sabres to a 4-1 win over the Carolina Hurricanes on Monday night.
	   Miroslav Satan and Michael Peca also scored for the Sabres, who
won for the eighth time in their last 10 games.
	   Robert Kron scored for Carolina, which lost for only the second
time in its last eight home games. Trevor Kidd made 29 saves after
making 38 in the Hurricanes' 3-2 win at Buffalo on Saturday.
	   Buffalo improved to 14-0-0 when leading after two periods as
Hasek earned his league-best 17th win.
 &UR; Canadiens 2, Stars 2
	   In Montreal, Darryl Sydor's goal at 13:54 of the third period
lifted the Dallas Stars into a tie with Montreal as the Canadiens
equalled a 50-year-old team winless mark.
	   The Canadiens remained winless in December at 0-5-5 _ equalling
the club's 10-game winless streak from the 1947-48 season. The team
record is 12 games without a win set in 1926 and equalled in 1935.
	   Sydor beat Jeff Hackett for his ninth goal as the Stars _ first
overall in the NHL with a 20-5-5 record _ kept alive a nine-game
unbeaten streak.
	   Benoit Brunet and Patrick Poulin scored in the second for
Montreal (8-17-7) before Sergei Zubov responded with only 30
seconds left in the period.
 &UR; Bruins 3, Lightning 2
	   In Boston, Kyle McLaren scored twice and Hal Gill had the
tie-breaking goal with 8:31 left in the third period as the Boston
Bruins beat the Tampa Bay Lightning.
	   Boston improved to 8-1-2 at home against Tampa Bay.
	   Craig Janney and Vincent Lecavalier scored for the Lightning,
who have the league's worst record (8-21-3) and dropped their 15th
game in their last 18.
	   Rob Tallas, making his first start since Nov. 24 and only his
sixth this season for Boston, stopped 24 shots. Bill Ranford made
31 saves in the Tampa Bay net.

Hasek, Sabres down Hurricanes 4-1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Leafs-Penguins; will be updated with late game &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GREENSBORO, North Carolina (AP) _ Jason Woolley had a goal and
two assists and Dominik Hasek made 19 saves to lead the Buffalo
Sabres to a 4-1 win over the Carolina Hurricanes on Monday night.
	   Miroslav Satan and Michael Peca also scored for the Sabres, who
won for the eighth time in their last 10 games.
	   Robert Kron scored for Carolina, which lost for only the second
time in its last eight home games. Trevor Kidd made 29 saves after
making 38 in the Hurricanes' 3-2 win at Buffalo on Saturday.
	   Buffalo improved to 14-0-0 when leading after two periods as
Hasek earned his league-best 17th win.
 &UR; Canadiens 2, Stars 2
	   In Montreal, Darryl Sydor's goal at 13:54 of the third period
lifted the Dallas Stars into a tie with Montreal as the Canadiens
equalled a 50-year-old team winless mark.
	   The Canadiens remained winless in December at 0-5-5 _ equalling
the club's 10-game winless streak from the 1947-48 season. The team
record is 12 games without a win set in 1926 and equalled in 1935.
	   Sydor beat Jeff Hackett for his ninth goal as the Stars _ first
overall in the NHL with a 20-5-5 record _ kept alive a nine-game
unbeaten streak.
	   Benoit Brunet and Patrick Poulin scored in the second for
Montreal (8-17-7) before Sergei Zubov responded with only 30
seconds left in the period.
 &UR; Bruins 3, Lightning 2
	   In Boston, Kyle McLaren scored twice and Hal Gill had the
tie-breaking goal with 8:31 left in the third period as the Boston
Bruins beat the Tampa Bay Lightning.
	   Boston improved to 8-1-2 at home against Tampa Bay.
	   Craig Janney and Vincent Lecavalier scored for the Lightning,
who have the league's worst record (8-21-3) and dropped their 15th
game in their last 18.
	   Rob Tallas, making his first start since Nov. 24 and only his
sixth this season for Boston, stopped 24 shots. Bill Ranford made
31 saves in the Tampa Bay net.
 &UR; Maple Leafs 7, Penguins 1
	   In Toronto, Mats Sundin scored two goals and Alyn McCauley had a
goal and two assists as the Maple Leafs routed the Pittsburgh
Penguins.
	   The Maple Leafs, who lead the NHL with 105 goals, have scored 14
in the last two games with McCauley collecting seven points during
that span.
	   Toronto goaltender Curtis Joseph made 30 saves as the Maple
Leafs were outshot 31-27.
	   Jason Smith, Derek King and Sergei Berezin also scored for the
Maple Leafs, who have won 10 of their last 11 home games. Jan
Hrdina scored for Pittsburgh.

Maier returns to victory leading 1-9 Austrian sweep
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PATSCHERKOFEL, Austria (AP) _ Hermann Maier, ``The Herminator''
of Alpine skiing, put an end to his reputed slump with a sensation.
	   The double Olympic champion led an unprecedented 1-9 finish by
Austrian skiers in a World Cup Super-G at the legendary
Patscherkofel course which hosted on Monday the first major
international event since the 1976 Olympics.
	   Maier said the victory, his third this season and the 13th of
his World Cup career, meant to lot to him because it came at the
same track where Austrian great Franz Klammer won the Olympic
downhill title.
	   A huge crowd, including hundreds of children who were given a
day off from school to watch the race, stormed the finish line area
after Maier and his teammates completed the Super-G relegating the
non-Austrians from tenth place on.
	   It was the first time in ski history that a country swept the
top nine places in an Alpine World Cup event.
	   Austrian skiers already had taken the top five spots in a
Super-G at Aspen, Colo., last month proving the strongest team in
the discipline which combines downhill speed and giant slalom
technique.
	   ``What a show .... We need more races like this,'' said a
jubilant Maier, who had been targeted by veiled criticism following
consecutive losses in two downhills in Val Gardena and a giant
slalom at Alta Badia over the last weekend.
	   The negative streak had cast a shadow on the supremacy of the
Austrian team on the men circuit.
	   Maier had been also disturbed by bitter allegations which
followed his decision to severe ties with a former East German
doping-tainted doctor who supervised his training program.
	   Monday's victory produced a wave of positive effects for Maier,
the defending World Cup overall, Super-G and giant slalom champion.
	   It brought him back atop the Cup overall standings, three points
ahead of Norway's Lasse Kjus. It gave him the lead in the Super-G
lists and made him the most successful man skier so far this season
with three wins in nine races.
	   Maier does not run slaloms, except those counting for the
combined.
	   The strongly-built Austrian said he was prepared to a long and
demanding season, including the World Championships in Vail, Colo.,
in February.
	   In the meantime he will try to end the year with another
remarkable achievement - the first Austrian downhill win in the
fourth speed race of this season on Dec. 29.
	   The race is scheduled at Bormio, northern Italy, where Maier has
won his first career downhill last year.

China sentences third leader of would-be democracy party

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A day after two prominent democracy campaigners
were given lengthy prison terms, a Chinese court sentenced a third
leader of a would-be opposition party Tuesday to 12 years in
prison.
	   The 12-year sentence given to Qin Yongmin fell predictably in
line with the verdicts issued Monday to fellow China Democracy
Party members: 13 years for Xu Wenli and 11 for Wang Youcai.
	   All three were tried in different cities for the same crime, the
subversion of state power, and for the same act, trying to set up
the China Democracy Party.
	   Their quick trials and harsh punishments showed how firmly
China's ruling Communist Party draws the line at open opposition.
Their treatment also undermined China's attempts to burnish its
reputation by signing U.N. rights treaties and nudging its legal
system closer to international standards.
	   The Intermediate People's Court in the central city of Wuhan
sentenced Qin in a 40-minute hearing, five days after his half-day
trial, his brother Qin Xiaoguang and fellow dissidents said.
	   Qin's brother, the only family member who went to the hearing,
said court officers refused to let him into the courtroom because
he arrived five minutes late.
	   He shouted to Qin as guards led him down the hallway afterwards:
```Qin Yongmin, what was the crime? What was the sentence?' He
shouted back `twelve years.'''
	   ```I'm not going to appeal. I have contempt for this court,'''
his brother recounted Qin Yongmin as saying before being led away.
	   By sentencing Qin, Xu and Wang, Chinese authorities have removed
the most influential figures involved in the China Democracy Party
and the dissident community at large.
	   Xu, 55, was known as an effective organizer and a moderating
voice. He earlier served 12 years in prison _ much of it in
solitary confinement _ for his involvement in the Democracy Wall
movement of the late 1970s.
	   Wang Youcai, 32, was a student leader in the 1989 Tiananmen
Square demonstrations who declared the formation of the opposition
group in June.
	   Qin, 45 and a Democracy Wall veteran, had tried to set up an
independent human rights monitoring group in addition to organizing
the China Democracy Party.
	   Their efforts drew enough support so that in six months
activists tried to set up branches of the China Democracy Party in
14 provinces and cities.
	   At his half-day trial in Beijing Monday, Xu said in court that
his work was entirely peaceful and open, said his wife, He Xintong.
	   Court officials denied requests from a U.S. Embassy official to
attend the trial. Police sealed off Beijing's No. 1 Intermediate
People's Court and kept foreign reporters about half a kilometer
(one-third of a mile) away.
	   Xu defiantly refused to appeal the verdict or to answer any
questions by the prosecutors and judges because he believed the
trial was political persecution ordered by China's rulers, his wife
said.
	   In court ``he was courageous, fantastic,'' she said in a
telephone interview late Monday. ``He said, `I'm willing to use the
sacrifice of myself to promote democracy in China. I'm not one who
encourages a struggle and then just lets others shed their
blood.'''
	   In Washington, the State Department called on Chinese
authorities to release the men immediately.
	   ``This form of peaceful political expression deserves the
protection of all governments,'' said Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott. ``We not only deplore that they were detained and
tried for such actions but are deeply disturbed by the long
sentences imposed and the lack of due process.''
	   China's international obligations ``require it to protect
peaceful political expression and association and to ensure a fair
public trial,'' Talbott said.
	   China recently signed key U.N. human rights covenants but it has
not allowed political organizing and refused to let the China
Democracy Party register. The ruling Communist Party has never
allowed an opposition party.
	   Judges in Beijing and Hangzhou found that Xu and Wang plotted
subversion by founding branches of the China Democracy Party in
both cities and accepting money from abroad, the official Xinhua
News Agency reported.
	   Wei Jingsheng, Xu's and Qin's colleague from the Democracy Wall
era, protested the sentences during a visit to Taiwan on Monday,
saying ``The Chinese Communist authorities' behavior is totally
unrestrained and irrational.''
	   Wei was sentenced to 15 years in prison in 1979, and Xu to 15
years in 1982. Both were released in 1993, but Wei was arrested
again a few months later, sentenced in 1995 to 14 years, released
last year and sent into exile.

Police say serious crime by young Japanese up sharply
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The number of serious crimes, including murder,
committed by Japanese youths surged during the first 11 months of
this year, according to a National Police Agency report published
Tuesday.
	   A total of 144,228 juveniles between the ages of 14 and 19 were
arrested or taken into protective custody for alleged criminal
offenses through November, the report said, up 3.1 percent from the
same period last year.
	   The report also said 257 were arrested for serious crimes,
including murder, attempted murder, murder-robbery and bodily
injury resulting in death.
	   That figure was almost 1.7 times above the year-earlier number
and the most since the NPA began taking such statistics in 1972.
	   Rising juvenile delinquency has led to a new round of
soul-searching about Japan's education system and the way children
are raised.
	   Previous discussions have cited the tremendous pressure on
Japanese children to conform, and to do well in highly competitive
school examinations.
	   In one of the most prominent cases this year, a 13-year-old
junior high school student in Tochigi prefecture, or state, north
of Tokyo, stabbed his teacher to death in January after being
scolded for tardiness.
	   The NPA report did not provide any analysis of the rise in
juvenile crimes.
	   The report comes one day after a ruling Liberal Democratic Party
panel on juvenile law proposed that the minimum age for criminal
punishment be lowered to 14 from the current 16.
	   Last week, the Education Ministry said reported cases of
beatings and other violence committed by school children at
Japanese schools, jumped to 29,000 last year, up from about 11,000
in 1996.

British embassy says balloon team given permission to continue

flight through China &QL;

permission granted to continue; other officials refusing to

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Three men hoping to be the first to circle the
world by balloon may still get their chance despite crossing into
Chinese air space without permission, prompting fears that their
adventure would be forced into an early ending.
	   The British Embassy said China gave permission to the
balloonists early Tuesday as long as they head southward and move
below 26 degrees north latitude. An embassy official, speaking with
customary anonymity, said the balloon was already heading south to
comply.
	   Contacted separately, the Chinese Foreign Ministry, the
government information office and official sports associations
refused to confirm the permission. And the balloon's support team
in London said they had not yet received any official response from
the Chinese government.
	   Piloted by British tycoon Richard Branson, American Steve
Fossett and Sweden's Per Linstrand, the balloon crossed from Nepal
into Chinese-ruled Tibet late Monday.
	   China had given permission for the ICO Global balloon to travel
in its airspace south of 26 degrees north latitude. But because of
diversions around Mediterranean storms and Iraq, the balloon
crossed the Himalayas further north than planned and entered China
250 miles north of the agreed airspace corridor.
	   Project director Mike Kendrick said Chinese air traffic
controllers were informed the moment the balloon passed over the
border, with an apology added to the communication. The balloon
team continued to contact them every 15 minutes to keep the Chinese
informed about their position.
	   ``We are in someone else's airspace without permission _ it is
not a nice place to be,'' he said.
	   But Kendrick added that the long journey across China was an
inescapable part of any round-the-world bid.
	   ``If we don't go through China, we don't do a global flight,''
he said. ``We have to go through China _ that is the bottom line.
All I'm hoping is that we can stay in the air for long enough.''
	   In February, China withheld permission for a European balloon
team to fly through its airspace, ending their around-the-world
bid.
	   As it became apparent early Monday that the balloon would
inevitably cross into unauthorized Chinese territory, frantic
diplomatic negotiations were launched by the British government.
Prime Minister Tony Blair sent a message to Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji asking for China's help, the British embassy official said.
	   The ICO Global balloon had already run into trouble on its trip.
Libya unexpectedly revoked permission to enter its airspace, but
the situation was resolved shortly before the three-man crew flew
over the country on Saturday.
	   Then, in conditions marred by thunderstorms, the crew had to
maneuver the 270-foot (82-meter) craft through narrow gaps between
no-fly territories, including war-torn Iraq.
	   On Monday night, the crew were flying through pitch darkness
over some of the world's highest peaks, where landing _ if China
had demanded it _ would have been dangerous and difficult. Landing
also would have meant an end to their bid.
	   The crew members estimate the trip could last from eight days to
nearly three weeks. They hope to touch down somewhere in western
Europe at the end of a 24,000-mile (38,000 kms) flight, which will
take them over India, the South China sea, the Pacific and the
United States.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and initially had only four refusals _ Iran, Iraq, Russia and North
Korea.

South Korea to pay dlrs 333 million for U.S. troops next year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea will pay dlrs 333 million
for keeping U.S. troops on its soil next year, American and South
Korean military officials said Tuesday.
	   Though Seoul has signed a long-term agreement to gradually
increase its share of the cost of keeping U.S. troops here, a
prolonged economic crisis has seriously curtailed the government's
financial capabilities.
	   The 1999 figure is down from dlrs 399 million this year as South
Korea will pay about two thirds of the cost in the Korean currency
at a pre-crisis exchange rate of about 900 won to the dollar.
	   The won traded at 1208.5 to the dollar Tuesday.
	   Under a mutual treaty, 37,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South
Korea.
	   The United States fought on South Korea's side against North
Korea in the 1950-53 Korean War. The conflict ended without a peace
treaty, leaving the two rival Koreas in a technical state of war.
