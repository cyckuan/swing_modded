	   SANTIAGO, Cuba (AP) _ Standing before the stone army barracks
where he launched his revolt 45 years before, Fidel Castro told
Cuba's communist faithful Sunday night that he and his revolution
remain intact despite economic hardship, and he laughed off reports
that have placed him at death's door.
	   ``I almost have fun with all this news,'' Castro said, speaking
at the annual July 26 celebration commemorating the aborted attack
that launched the Cuban revolution.
	   ``Every once in a while they kill me off,'' said Castro, who
turns 72 next month. ``The day I die, no one will believe it.''
	   Before some 10,000 people gathered outside the Moncada barracks
where he and fellow rebels were repelled by the soldiers of
dictator Fulgencio Batista, Castro declared that his revolution is
alive and well.
	   ``We now have to perfect it, to become stronger, more cultured,
more prepared,'' Castro said, after listing the accomplishments of
his socialist revolution: free education and health care, access to
utilities, home ownership.
	   All that, he said, ``despite the enormous difficulties of the
special period,'' _ the official term for the economic crisis that
slammed Cuba when it lost its Soviet bloc trading partners at the
beginning of this decade.
	   ``In difficult moments, the people unite to support the
revolution,'' Manuel Valdez, 63, a retired soldier from this
eastern provincial city, said shortly before Castro took the stage.
	   Castro did not name the newspaper that reported he was sick last
year, referring only to ``a prominent American newspaper whose
opinions we do not always agree with.''
	   El Nuevo Herald newspaper of Miami on July 19 reported that a
woman it identified as a former surgeon at a Havana hospital said
Castro was hospitalized from Oct. 22-28 for treatment of
hypertensive encephalopathy, a brain disease.
	   Castro has since said he had never heard of the disease or the
woman cited in the report, Elizabeth Trujillo.
	   After joking about the report, Castro then spoke for more than
an hour about a series published this month in the New York Times.
	   The Times series quoted Cuban exile Luis Posada Carriles, who
once had ties to the Central Intelligence Agency, as saying that
his efforts to depose Castro's government through last year's
bombings at luxury hotels were financed by the Miami-based Cuban
American National Foundation.
	   ``I think that it is important that public opinon in the United
States is informed about the crimes committed against our
country,'' Castro said.
	   Posada later denied the newspaper reports in a television
interview, saying he had never received money from foundation
leaders. Jorge Mas Santos, the son of the foundation's late leader,
also denied the reports.
	   Dressed in his trademark olive military fatigues but without his
billed cap, Castro started out with a lengthy history lesson about
Santiago, which was invaded by the U.S. military a century ago this
year.
	   ``On April 19, 1898, the U.S. Congress adopted a joint
resolution declaring that the people of Cuba should be free and
independent. It was a deceitful resolution,'' Castro said. Spanish
rule of Cuba ended when the Americans landed in 1898, but the
United States continued to control the Caribbean island until 1902.
	   ``It is good to remember these things,'' he said, his voice
breaking frequently as he started out, but growing stronger and
clearer as the speech wore on. He also called ``illegal'' the U.S.
military's continued presence at Guantanamo Bay, on the island's
eastern tip.
	   Earlier in the day, some of Castro's first followers returned to
Granjita Siboney, the farming village where they spent the night
before the 1953 attack on the Moncada barracks. They encouraged
schoolchildren not to lose faith in the revolution.
	   But these are troubled times in Cuba. A decades-old U.S.
economic embargo has taken a heavy toll, and most foreign aid dried
up almost a decade ago with the collapse of the Soviet bloc.

Leaf's got his dough, and now he'll throw
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Now that he's got his millions, Ryan Leaf can
play football.
	   The rookie quarterback, who led Washington State to the Rose
Bowl as a junior, will begin practicing with the San Diego Chargers
on Monday after signing a contract that could be worth dlrs 31.25
million for five years.
	   The contract includes an dlrs 11.25 million signing bonus, the
largest ever for a rookie.
	   With contracts so much bigger these days than in the era of Hall
of Fame quarterback Dan Fouts, this is perhaps the most significant
signing ever for the Chargers, who have been in a free-fall since
making it to the Super Bowl after the 1994 season.
	   At a news conference Sunday evening, Leaf thanked general
manager Bobby Beathard, who gave up a quarterback's ransom just to
be able to take Leaf with the second pick in the April draft.
	   ``I was laughing on my way over, saying, `Luckily you guys
didn't draft Peyton, or he wouldn't be in camp tomorrow,' '' Leaf
said.
	   Leaf's holdout lasted two days, costing him four practices.
Still, the strong-armed quarterback from Great Falls, Montana, will
get into camp before Peyton Manning, taken by Indianapolis with the
first pick. Manning is the Colts' only unsigned player.
	   Leaf said he doesn't want to walk into camp ``and feel like I'm
a big shot or somebody who held out a couple of days. I really want
my teammates and my fellow coaches to realize that I was really
anxious to get into camp and I hope my offseason work ethic shows
that.''
	   During his brief holdout, Leaf worked out with his roommate and
watched videotapes of the Chargers' practices.
	   ``It just wasn't the same,'' Leaf said.
	   That'll all change Monday morning, when Leaf starts throwing the
ball again. Quarterbacks coach June Jones said it helped that Leaf
spent extra time working with he and head coach Kevin Gilbride this
summer.
	   That's something that incumbent starter Craig Whelihan didn't
do. Whelihan was 0-7 in relief of Stan Humphries last year.
	   ``It's still too bad he missed repetitions, but he's probably a
lot closer than he was on June 1,'' Jones said of Leaf. That was
the date drafted players could begin working out fulltime with
their new teams.
	   The Chargers say they should know by the middle of training camp
who will start the season opener against Buffalo at home on Sept.
6, although it probably will be Leaf.
	   The Chargers lost their last eight games of 1997 to finish 4-12
and Humphries was driven into retirement because of too many
concussions.
	   Chargers owner Alex Spanos, known for his impatience, told Leaf:
``Only you can make things happen. ... Son, just take us where we
want to go.''
	   Leaf knows about the expectations and what it took for San Diego
to get him.
	   ``I'm just a rookie,'' Leaf said. ``I still have a lot to learn
and I'm going to make mistakes. I think everybody knows that, but I
think they see promise in the future and that's what I hope comes
along. That's going to count on me working hard. I'm not going to
let them down.''
	   To move up just one spot in the draft, Beathard sent Arizona two
players, including Eric Metcalf; first-round picks this year and
next, and this year's second-rounder.

Malaysia threatens press with sedition act and jail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's information ministry
threatened to jail members of the local media without trial and to
``black out'' foreign news reports that it believes undermine the
country's leadership, a news report said Monday.
	   ``If the media indulges in activities that threaten political
stability or national unity, we will come down hard, regardless of
whether they are local or foreign,'' Deputy Information Minister
Suleiman Mohamad was quoted as saying by the Sun newspaper.
	   Suleiman told local reporters on Sunday that foreign media,
fueled by conspirators in the local press, were using the economic
crisis to further an agenda to topple Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.
	   Suleiman warned the press to halt what he called an ``ongoing
conspiracy,'' warning there were several ways to mute the media.
	   ``The local media is kept in check with the Internal Security
Act,'' said Suleiman, referring to a law that permits authorities
to jail suspects without trial for inciting public unrest.
	   Another way to curb negative reports by foreign media was to
``black out'' their stories or counter them with reports by the
government news agency, Bernama, the minister said.
	   ``People suffer when there is political unrest,'' Suleiman said.
``Do they want us to riot, like in Jakarta?''
	   The Malaysian government has strongly censured the foreign media
and local press lately for ``negative'' coverage that highlighted
Malaysia's problems in dealing with the economic crisis and
differences among top leaders.
	   The editors of the country's top two newspapers were abruptly
moved earlier this month, reportedly over differences with the
ruling party.
	   Mahathir has traditionally shown little patience for criticism
during his 17-year rule. In a nationwide crackdown on dissent in
1987, three national newspapers were closed down.

Policemen, militiamen killed in rebel ambush
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) - At least three policemen and a
militiamen were killed in an ambush by communist rebels in the
southern Philippines over the weekend, the national police said
Monday.
	   The victims were on a jeep Saturday when they were fired upon by
New People's Army guerrillas hiding on the side of a road in Davao
Oriental province, about 965 kilometers (600 miles) southeast of
Manila.
	   Another policeman, an army sergeant who hitched a ride and two
civilians were wounded in the ambush, police said.
	   The rebels seized three assault rifles and ammunition from the
slain policemen before escaping, the police said.
	   The rebels continue to engage in occasional hit-and-run attacks
against isolated military and police units despite ongoing peace
negotiations.
	   The talks to end three decades of insurgency have resulted in an
agreement on respect for human rights, which has not yet been
approved by Philippine President Joseph Estrada.
	   The human rights accord is the first of four agreements before a
political settlement is reached. The three others cover economic
reforms, political reforms and disposition of armed forces.

Bankruptcies and business closures up in economically troubled
</HEADLINE>
Singapore

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Bankruptcies and business closures are on the
rise in Singapore as its vulnerable economy stalls, job losses
increase and fatalism sets in, according to a news report on
Monday.
	   Personal bankruptcies rose 20 percent to 986 in the first half
of 1998 compared to last year, of which 41 percent were due to
failed businesses and 16 percent to job losses, reported The
Straits Times.
	   Company closures also jumped during the economically trying
period, increasing 18 percent to 125 liquidations from January to
June this year against 106 in the first half of 1997.
	   Small to medium enterprises fared worst, with 42 percent of
these closures among companies with paid-up capital of between
100,000 to 500,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs 58,000 to 291,000). Most
of the 125 liquidations were companies in the commerce,
construction and manufacturing sectors.
	   A lawyer who frequently represents lenders told the newspaper
that debtors are now more resigned to fate.
	   ``Now, they just seem to accept that they cannot repay, that the
situation is really beyond their control,'' Tan Peng Chin was
quoted as saying.
	   Singapore's economy, though spared the brunt of economic
catastrophe striking some of its neighbors, has nevertheless slowed
significantly since the onset of the Asian crisis.
	   Its manufacturing sector has slumped due to regional and global
factors, while the service, retail, commerce and construction
sectors remain sluggish.
	   The government recently slashed the growth forecast for 1998 to
between 0.5 and 1.5 percent, and the prime minister has warned that
a recession is likely next year.

Three fans killed in auto race crash

 &UR; Eds: RECAPS to identify victims; CLARIFIES first deaths in a decade
from a racing accident, not at a race. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BROOKLYN, Michigan (AP) _ A crash at the U.S. 500 auto race
hurled a tire and other car parts into the grandstand, killing
three spectators and injuring six others.
	   It was the first time in more than a decade that spectators were
killed in an accident in a major auto race.
	   Dr. Gregory Baumann, the chief medical director at Michigan
Speedway, said two people died instantly Sunday from the impact of
the debris. A third person later died at one of the track's medical
units.
	   Six spectators were taken by helicopter to Foote Hospital in
Jackson, where they were listed in stable condition with injuries
ranging from a fractured leg to neck and back injuries, hospital
officials said.
	   A car driven by Adrian Fernandez of Mexico, the pole winner for
the Championship Auto Racing Teams race, slid into the wall on lap
175 of the 250-lap race.
	   His right front tire and pieces of the suspension broke off,
flying into the crowd in the fourth-turn grandstand. Fernandez, who
was in third place at the time of the crash, suffered bruised
knees.
	   As he heard the noise of the crash below, Gerald Bramer stood up
to see what was happening. ``The next thing I know, a tire was
flying in the air right at us,'' said Bramer, who attend the race
with his brother Rich.
	   Bramer said he threw up his arm to block the tire as it brushed
by him. It hit his brother in the back, but neither was injured
seriously.
	   Becky Lutgen was at the track with her boyfriend watching
Fernandez's car as it rounded the bend. She said they didn't see
the tire from his car until it hit the stands and then landed about
four or five rows behind them.
	   ``It ricocheted in the stands and came to rest between some
rows. It went by so fast,'' Lutgen said.
	   The fourth-turn grandstand area where the spectators were hit
was cleared immediately and a medical examiner's investigation
began.
	   The U.S. 500, run before a crowd of about 50,000, continued
after the accident and was won By Greg Moore.
	   ``It's terrible, a tragedy,'' said Jimmy Vasser, the runner-up.
``We don't want to see that happen.''
	   Michael Terry Tautkus, 49, and Sheryl Ann Laster, 40, both of
Milan; and Kenneth Dale Fox, 38, of Lansing were killed in the
accident, authorities said.
	   The injured, all from Michigan, were identified as David Silva,
35, of Dearborn; Gerald Bramer, 31, and Richard Bramer, 20, both of
Livonia; Doris Shuman, 70, of West Bloomfield; Joyce Thompson, 48,
of Spring Arbor, and Steve Dawson, 31, of Lansing.
	   Silva, the Bramers and Thompson were all treated and released.
	   The deaths were the first among spectators at the track since
1969, when one fan was killed during a Trans-Am race on the road
course.
	   At the 1987 Indianapolis 500, a tire bounded off the track,
landing in the top row of the grandstand and killing a fan. There
have been other spectator deaths since at drag races and other auto
events.

Chinese trader gets 20 years for propagating pornography
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A Chinese trader has been sentenced to 20
years in jail for smuggling and propagating pornography, a court
official said Monday.
	   Zhong Xuhui, 25, who lives in Hi Ch Minh City, was convicted
Saturday. Last August, police raided his house and seized more than
2,000 smuggled video compact discs, including 251 pornography
recordings, the official said.
	   The government two years ago launched a campaign to wipe out
social vices, which include drug abuse, prostitution and gambling.
	   Passengers from abroad have their luggage x-rayed by Customs at
the airports in Ho Chi Minh City and Saigon, with officers
routinely asking to look at any videos that show up.

New Japanese leader promises action to fix economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Albright speech; comments by Albright and Chinese
foreign minister Tang Jiaxuan after their meeting; EDITS to
conform; TRIMS. &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM RAUM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The world's two largest economies
pledged major efforts to lift Asia out of its current financial
doldrums, but, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told a
conference of Asian nations the time is ``characterized more by
doubt than by triumph.''
	   ``There are no easy answers,'' she told the annual security
forum of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations on Monday.
	   Japan's incoming prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, also pledged
Japanese help.
	   In remarks Sunday, he said his top priorities _ once he is
formally ratified as prime minister later this week _ are ending
Japan's own recession and ``making a contribution to Asia.''
	   And Obuchi told Albright separately he will overcome his
reputation for indecisiveness by following through on a campaign
pledge to enact a package of a dlrs 43 billion tax cut and dlrs 71
billion in government spending, U.S. officials said.
	   Asia's financial crisis dominated the session as the nine ASEAN
members were joined on Monday by other major powers, including the
United States, Japan, China, Russia and the European Union. Obuchi
returned to Japan to prepare for his leadership role and did not
attend Monday's session.
	   Albright said the United States has ``a vital security interest
in speeding Asia's recovery.'' But she said that, even with
assistance from the United States and international lending
institutions, the road to recovery was a tough one.
	   ``There is no question the region will recover. ... The real
question is whether it will emerge stronger, more open, more
democratic, better equipped to meet new challenges,'' she told the
ASEAN meeting.
	   ``This year, we are meeting at a time characterized more by
doubt than by triumph,'' she said.
	   Turning to other Asian controversies, Albright reiterated the
U.S. demand that India and Pakistan back away from their nuclear
programs and sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ``without
conditions.''
	   She also said that it remains to be seen whether Cambodian
elections, held on Sunday, had been fair and open. ``We have seen
the democratic process in Cambodia unravel before,'' she said.
	   Meanwhile, China's foreign minister, Tang Jiaxuan, said China
would follow through on a promise made during President Bill
Clinton's recent visit to China _ detargeting missiles aimed at
U.S. cities _ but provided no specifics.
	   ``This has already been decided upon by the two presidents,''
Tang said, expressing ``surprise'' that the issue had been raised
by reporters at a picture-taking session during a breakfast meeting
with Albright on Monday.
	   ``According to the ancient Chinese philosophy, the Chinese
people are a people who always honor our promises with real
actions,'' he said.
	   The U.S.-China summit between Clinton and Chinese President
Jiang Zemin earlier this month yielded a symbolic agreement to stop
aiming nuclear missiles at each other.
	   China has 18 long-range missiles _ 13 of them currently aimed at
U.S. cities _ compared with the United States' 6,000 or so nuclear
warheads.
	   Albright told the Chinese delegation she was pleased ``to start
the day with you because we really are, now, real friends.''
	   Although Albright has been pressuring Japan to do more, in
Sunday's meeting Obuchi ``laid out a fairly comprehensive agenda
and said he was going to move on it very quickly,'' a senior U.S.
administration official said, briefing reporters on condition of
anonymity. ``In a sense, it wasn't really necessary for her to give
him a long laundry list.''
	   Obuchi, currently Japan's foreign minister, was elected Friday
to head the Liberal Democratic Party, all but assuring his
succession to the prime minister's position next week. He spent
much of Sunday touching base in Manila with leaders gathered for
the annual ASEAN meeting.
	   Foreign ministers of the ASEAN nations _ the Philippines,
Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore, Vietnam, Laos and
Myanmar, formerly Burma _ held a festive dinner Sunday night with
their outside colleagues.
	   Albright, who also met Sunday with the Philippine foreign
minister, Domingo Siazon, also planned one-on-one meetings Monday
with the foreign ministers of Russia, South Korea and India.
	   Obuchi's words on his economic plans were followed closely
because Southeast Asian nations look toward Japan, which has the
world's second-largest economy, to pull the region out of its
yearlong crisis.
	   U.S. officials fear worsening of Japan's economic situation
could aggravate the Asian crisis dramatically and increase its
impact on the U.S. economy as well.
	   On his flight from Tokyo Sunday, Obuchi told reporters he is
aware of Asian countries' worries about the state of Japan's
economy.
	   ``I want to communicate strongly my ideas for revitalizing the
domestic economy and making a contribution to Asia,'' he told
reporters on the plane.
	   Japan must ``expedite the implementation of its economic
measures in support of the economic recovery of ASEAN countries,''
the ASEAN ministers said in a communique Saturday.
	   The best thing Japan can do for economic recovery in ASEAN ``is
to get its own financial house in order,'' said Thai Foreign
Ministry spokesman Kobsak Chutikul. ``The financial disease started
in Japan in 1991-92, and they never cured it. So it cropped up
somewhere else, like malaria. We were the manifestation of that
disease.''

Teacher jailed for beating 8-year-old student
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A primary-school teacher has been
sentenced to 18 months in jail for beating an 8-year-old student
who was left with a disabling head injury, a judge said Monday.
	   Tran Van Dau also was ordered to provide 10.7 million dong (dlrs
800) in compensation, said Huynh Phuong Chon, chief judge of the An
Minh district court in the southern province of Kien Giang.
	   Chon said Dau's son had been injured in a dispute with classmate
Le Thanh Nhan at the Dong Thanh A primary school. Dau went to
Nhan's home, but his parents refused to provide any compensation
for the injuries.
	   Dau returned to school and hit Nhan several times. The boy's
head hit a wall, leaving him with an estimated 41 percent
disability.

Thai government shuts down paper mill for polluting water
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Just days after reporting record
shipments of its products, Thailand's Phoenix Pulp and Paper was
shut down on Monday for six months by the government for polluting
rivers near its mill.
	   ``The company has received the official notification from the
department of Industrial Works to close down the mill phase-I
effective from July 27 up to January 31, 1999,'' Pulp and Paper
managing director Ralph Mattsson said in a letter to the Stock
Exchange of Thailand.
	   Phoenix Pulp and Paper, which employs 1,200 full-time workers,
is the country's largest producer of market hardwood pulp, turning
out 210,000 metric tons of pulp each year.
	   Its mill in Khon Kaen province, 390 kilometers (242 miles)
northeast of Bangkok, has been at the center of a battle between
Phoenix Pulp &AMP; Paper, environmental groups and local residents who
have been claiming for years that the company is responsible for
polluting the Nam Phong and other nearby rivers.
	   Opposition lawmakers took up their cause and called for the
closure of the mill. The company said it ceased discharging
effluent into the nearby rivers in April.
	   Last week union management representing the pulp mill workers
presented a letter of concern to the Thai government over the calls
to close the factory.
	   Last Thursday, the company said that during the first half of
1998 it broke its all-time record for pulp shipments for the first
six months of any year, shipping 116,000 tons, 55 percent of which
was exported.

Cheats palming off fake million-dollar notes in India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Confidence men are peddling fake
million-dollar bills _ some graced with the image of U.S. President
Bill Clinton _ to gullible travelers heading to the United States
and Canada for medical treatment, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   The United States government doesn't print notes of such a high
denomination, but many people have been fooled by the quality of
the paper and printing, the Times of India newspaper reported.
	   ``The million-dollar notes certainly look very real,'' it quoted
New Delhi superintendent of police Anil Kumar as saying.
	   Police in Calcutta recently seized 210 of the bills, the paper
said. The notes have a picture of the Statue of Liberty on one side
and of Mount Rushmore, a cliff-sculpture of four U.S. presidents,
on the back. Some also carry pictures of Fort Knox, where the
government keeps its gold reserves, and the American eagle seal. A
few also have Clinton's face on them.
	   The U.S. government printed million-dollar certificates in 1934
for use by the country's central bank, but they were never
circulated among the public, the report said.
	   Among those duped so far was a New York man who bought a
million-dollar bill at a discount from a seller who said he was
desperate for cash. The buyer learned later from his bank that the
note was worthless, the newspaper said.
	   The cheats usually show a photocopy of the million-dollar bill
along with a ``certificate of authenticity'' to con people, it
said.
	   Detectives stumbled upon the counterfeiting when they arrested
eight men in Calcutta suspected of forging a popular Indian
certificate of deposit. Officers seized a large quantity of bogus
foreign currencies, stock certificates and other securities, the
paper said.

Australia welcomes troop withdrawal from East Timor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Australia's foreign minister on
Monday welcomed Indonesia's decision to withdraw 1,000 troops from
the troubled province of East Timor.
	   ``It will help the process of reconciliation. But as everybody
knows, there is still a long way to go on the issue of East
Timor,'' Foreign Minister Alexander Downer told reporters.
	   Downer said he met with Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas
in Manila, where they are attending multilateral talks on security
issues, and Alatas told him it was the first in a series of
withdrawals from East Timor.
	   Rebels have been fighting for independence for East Timor, a
former Portuguese colony that Indonesia annexed in January 1976.
The Indonesian government has been seeking to relax tension in the
region since B.J. Habibie succeeded Suharto as president in May.

Australia, Russia set up regular high-level defense talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Australia and Russia have agreed to
hold regular high-level talks on Asian and international security
issues.
	   Foreign ministers of the two countries reached the agreement on
the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
Regional Forum, a wider, multilateral security conference that
continued Monday in Manila.
	   Australia's foreign minister, Alexander Downer, called the
agreement a ``significant step forward'' in his country's relations
with Russia, which he said have been rather limited since the Cold
War.
	   Downer said no joint military exercises are envisioned for now,
and, ``I certainly don't see a security alliance developing.''
	   Officials of the defense and foreign ministries are to
participate in the talks, with the first round likely to take place
in October.
	   In addition to Asian security, they will cover issues of
disarmament and non-proliferation as well as emerging security
arrangements in the region, including the ASEAN Regional Forum.
Both countries are involved in the forum, along with other Asian
and Western countries.

Hong Kong Telcom plans to lay off workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Adding to Hong Kong's growing jobless toll,
Hong Kong Telecommunications _ one of the territory's largest
employers _ laid off 270 managers Monday.
	   A company statement said the layoffs were ``part of an overall
program to reshape business and enhance productivity.''
	   They were necessary in an ``increasingly competitive market
environment and ahead of further liberalization in the
telecommunications market next year,'' it said.
	   Earlier this year, the company surrendered its monopoly on
international phone calls in exchange for a government payment of
U.S. dlrs 858 million.
	   Union officials were quoted Sunday as saying that the company
planned to cut its work force by 1,000 through early retirement or
by worker's leaving voluntarily.
	   Ip Kwok-fun, chairman of one of the unions, was quoted by
state-run radio as saying that the 270 managers had agreed to leave
in exchange for buyouts. The company statement said it paid the
workers 100 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 12.8 million).
	   Hong Kong's Labor Department has set up a hotline for the
workers.
	   Analysts said the news isn't entirely unexpected as the company
faces a slowdown in traffic due to the Asian economic crisis.
	   ``There is still a lot of concern about the slowdown in IDD
(international direct-dialing) traffic for the company,'' said
Marvin Lo, an analyst at Amsteel Securities Ltd.
	   Company shares were down 1 percent to 14.50 Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 1.86) just before the midday close Monday.
	   The government announced last week that unemployment had hit a
15-year high of 4.5 percent.

Pepper misses birdie putt and playoff with Pak
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs to ADD quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; By RUSTY MILLER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HOWLAND, Ohio (AP) _ Se Ri Pak still doesn't think she's one of
the top golfers in the world. Her latest result says otherwise.
	   The unflappable 20-year-old rookie birdied the final hole and
then watched as Dottie Pepper missed a 4-foot (1.22-meter) birdie
putt that would have forced a playoff, giving Pak a one-shot
victory Sunday in the Giant Eagle LPGA Classic.
	   It was Pak's fourth victory of the season and her third in her
last four tournaments.
	   ``Now? No,'' Pak responded when asked if she was close to being
among the elite players in the world. ``I'm thinking I have much to
learn about my golf game. I hit stupid shots many times.''
	   The victory again put Pak into the No. 1 spot on the LPGA money
list. She has finished in the top 10 in only four tournaments _
winning each one.
	   Pepper, seeking her 15th career victory and first in 45
tournaments, rolled in a 5-foot (1.52-meter) birdie putt on the
17th hole to catch Pak at 14-under.
	   On No. 18, Pak hit a fairway wood for her second shot on the
451-yard (412-meter), par-5 hole that hit on the front edge of the
green and rolled 15 feet (4.57 meters) short and right of the cup.
	   Pepper, playing one group behind Pak, was watching from the
fairway as Pak just missed the eagle putt but tapped in for birdie
to cap a 5-under-par 67 and finish at 15-under 201.
	   ``I had no idea what was going on,'' Pepper said. ``When I saw
Se Ri miss her putt, I thought she had missed her birdie. I had no
idea it was for eagle.''
	   Pepper pushed her fairway wood right, but got a favorable bounce
off a hump behind the greenside bunker, the ball rolling to a stop
40 feet (12.19 meters) right of cup.
	   Pepper made a charge at what could have been the winning eagle
putt, hitting it 4 feet (1.22 meters) past the hole. A television
camera caught Pak yawning as she watched the drama.
	   While Pak turned away to rest in the scorer's tent, Pepper then
rammed the birdie putt past on the right side to give the dlrs
120,000 first-place check to Pak.
	   ``People told me, `Playoff.' Then they said, `You win!' I didn't
know I win,'' Pak said.
	   Pepper, too, thought that she had gotten into a playoff with Pak
_ even after three-putting.
	   Not until she saw her caddie, John Killeen, take off his caddie
bib did she realize that she had lost.
	   ``I asked John why he was taking his bib off. I said, `We're
going back to the tee, aren't we?' '' she said as her eyes began to
fill with tears. ``He said no.''
	   Pak has been on an incredible tear on the LPGA tour the last
month.
	   After capturing the LPGA Championship _ the year's first
grand-slam event _ Pak has won three of her last four starts. The
streak started with a dramatic 20-hole playoff victory over amateur
Jenny Chuasiriporn in the U.S. Women's Open. A week later, she set
LPGA records for 18-hole score (61), back-to-back rounds (61-63)
and 72-hole total (261) while winning the Jamie Farr Kroger Classic
by nine strokes.
	   In the Giant Eagle, she had rounds of 65, 69 and 67 had only one
bogey in the tournament.
	   Pak started the day tied for third and three shots back of
Pepper. But Pepper got off to a rocky start, hitting her drive on
the first hole into a lake and dropping out of the lead with a
double bogey.
	   Playing in the group ahead of Pepper, Pak was steady, posting
three birdies and her lone bogey on the front side before putting
up birdies at No. 10, the 15th and the closing hole.
	   Robin Walton made it a three-way battle for the lead, matching
the Avalon Lakes course record with an 8-under 64 that left her at
13-under.
	   Her undoing was the final hole. While Pak played it in 4-under
for the three rounds, she was 3-over on it _ including a
triple-bogey 8 in the opening round. The 8 included a two-stroke
penalty for removing a golf ball-sized stone from near her ball.
	   Pak's 7-foot (2.13-meter) birdie putt at the 10th pulled her
even with Walton and a 6-footer (1.83-meter shot) at the 15th gave
her the lead by herself _ until Pepper birdied at 17 to pull even
and set the stage for the roller-coaster finish.
	   ``She definitely has a lot to learn,'' said Pepper, who was
deprived of her first win in two years. ``But she's obviously an A
student.''
	   Walton finished alone in third at 13-under, with Kelly Robbins
shooting a closing 65 to share fourth place with Leta Lindley and
Pearl Sinn.

India, Pakistan criticized over nuclear tests at ASEAN meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos ASEAN 101-108
 &UR; By LAURINDA KEYS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ After enthusiastic promises from
Japan's incoming prime minister to lift Asia's largest economy out
of recession, Asian and Western nations at a regional security
forum were disappointed Monday with India's response to criticism
of its nuclear tests.
	   ``There is only one country putting up any defense of India, and
that is India,'' said Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer,
speaking after heated debate during a Sunday dinner and Monday
meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional
Forum.
	   He said there was ``very deep concern about the Indian and
Pakistani nuclear tests and the challenge they have thrown up to
the non-proliferation regime which has served the world so well for
the last 30 years.''
	   Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan described the tests as
``plunging South Asia into a sudden wave of tension.''
	   Pakistan is not a member of the forum, which includes 20
countries ranging from Myanmar to the United States. India is
represented by deputy planning chairman Jaswant Singh, who refused
to acknowledge to reporters Sunday night that he had ever heard of
any criticism of the May 11 and 13 nuclear tests.
	   Objecting to moves by the Philippines and others to condemn the
nuclear testing in a strongly worded communique, Singh said the
forum ``is a consensus body and there should be no divisions on any
issue.''
	   He said India has always favored nuclear disarmament, but felt
the need to conduct tests ``because the non-proliferation regime
had turned flawed and discriminatory.''
	   Singh said India does not advocate further testing and conducted
the tests ``to fill a vacuum that could have resulted in grave and
irreparable damage to India's supreme national interest.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright demanded that India
and Pakistan back away from their nuclear programs and sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ``without conditions.''
	   Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan, the only country to have
been attacked with nuclear bombs, said the Indian and Pakistani
tests were ``a major challenge to the nuclear nonproliferation
regime. The international community must join hands and firmly
respond.''
	   Obuchi, set to become Japan's prime minister later this week,
left early Monday for home, after apparently making a hit with his
colleagues by promising dynamic action on economic stimulus
measures.
	   He said he would quickly enact a dlrs 43 billion tax cut and
dlrs 71 billion government spending program to make ``a
contribution to Asia.''
	   Japan is the biggest investor, trade partner and development aid
donor in Southeast Asia. With its huge economy _ the world's second
largest _ in recession, its smaller, weaker neighbors have little
chance of a rapid recovery from the year-long currency and economic
crises.
	   Southeast Asian nations, which seek to create a nuclear free
zone in their region while pushing the nuclear weapons states
toward full disarmament, were stunned by the recent nuclear tests
by India and Pakistan.
	   Sources who attended the three-hour dinner Sunday night said
Singh had listed a string of arguments which the other delegates
disputed one by one.
	   On Monday delegates were still debating whether to use the word
``condemn'' and whether to name India and Pakistan in their final
communique. A draft copy had the ministers calling for a total
cessation of nuclear tests and urging the two countries to sign the
international nuclear non-proliferation and test ban treaties.
	   The annual forum is designed to promote peaceful relations and
defuse potential crises through informal one-on-one and group
meetings among the nine ASEAN foreign ministers and their
counterparts in North America, Europe, elsewhere in Asia and the
South Pacific.

Fijians settle on a name as new constitution comes into force

<TEXT>
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ Long-held grievances that have split the
Pacific Island nation of Fiji for decades ended Monday when a new
constitution abolishing discrimination against non-indigenous
Fijians came into force.
	   Symbolic of the reform, the about 800,000 people of Fiji, after
28 years of infighting, have finally agreed on a name for
themselves in their multiracial society.
	   From Monday, indigenous Fijians as well as the descendants of
Indian, Chinese and European laborers and traders will all be
officially known as Fiji Islanders.
	   The new name is part of sweeping reforms to the rules of
government in Fiji, ushered in by the new constitution, which came
into force from midnight Sunday.
	   The new document ends an internationally condemned system of
government which was installed after two military coups in 1987.
	   The official name for the 360 island archipelago will also
change, to the ``Republic of the Fiji Islands'' from the
``Sovereign Democratic Republic of Fiji.''
	   Since gaining independence from Britain in 1970, indigenous
Fijians _ a Melanesian people strongly influenced by Polynesian
culture who form just over half the total population _ have opposed
the use of the word Fijian to describe the nationality of decedents
of sugar plantation workers and traders from India, China, Europe
and other countries.
	   Indigenous Fijians claimed applying the description to other
citizens, particularly Indians, undermined their historic primacy.
They said this even though Fijian is not a Fijian word, being
derived from a description of the country's people by the British
navigator James Cook 200 years ago.
	   Indigenous Fijians referred to Indians an Kai India or Fiji
Indians and to white people as Kai Valagi.
	   In recent years many citizens of Indian descent referred to
themselves as ``Indo-Fijians,'' but that didn't go down well with
Fijians either.
	   Indigenous Fijians refer to themselves as ``i taukei'' _
literally ``owners of the land'' _ and retain communal ownership of
87 percent of all of Fiji's land mass.
	   The divisions erupted into the 1987 coups, in which the
Fijian-dominated army overthrew what in a general election had
become the country's first Indian-dominated Parliament and
government.
	   The new constitution replaces one imposed in 1990 by the
post-coup regime. It barred non-Fijians from becoming prime
minister, president or other key government posts and gave native
Fijians, who until recently were less than half the population, a
guaranteed parliamentary majority.
	   The new constitution follows international criticism, and is a
condition of Fiji's reentry into the British Commonwealth.
	   The new constitution removes discriminatory clauses, adds a bill
of rights and freedom of information laws, creates a human rights
commission and a 71-member elected Lower House of Parliament in
which native Fijians are not guaranteed a majority.
	   A 52-member Upper House Senate will be composed of 14 Fijian
members nominated by the Great Council of Chiefs, nine nominated by
the prime minister, eight by the leader of the opposition and one
by the island of Rotuma.
	   Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka, who led the 1987 coups and was
elected prime minister in 1992, has said the first election under
the new constitution will be held in March 1999.
	   The president will be nominated by the chiefs.
	   Election campaigning is already underway.

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) - At least three policemen and a
militiaman were killed in an ambush by communist rebels in the
southern Philippines over the weekend, the national police said
Monday.
	   The victims were on a jeep Saturday when they were fired upon by
New People's Army guerrillas hiding on the side of a road in Davao
Oriental province, about 965 kilometers (600 miles) southeast of
Manila.
	   Another policeman, an army sergeant who hitched a ride and two
civilians were wounded in the ambush, police said.
	   The rebels seized three assault rifles and ammunition from the
slain policemen before escaping, the police said.
	   The rebels continue to engage in occasional hit-and-run attacks
against isolated military and police units despite ongoing peace
negotiations.
	   The talks to end three decades of insurgency have resulted in an
agreement on respect for human rights, which has not yet been
approved by Philippine President Joseph Estrada.
	   The human rights accord is the first of four agreements before a
political settlement is reached. The three others cover economic
reforms, political reforms and disposition of armed forces.

Singapore women leaders condemn rapes in Indonesia as war crimes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The systematic rape of Chinese women and
children during recent unrest in Indonesia should be deemed war
crimes, women leaders in neighboring Singapore were quoted as
saying on Monday.
	   Human rights and women's groups in Indonesia say organized gangs
committed at least 168 rapes during the unrest in May, attacking
mostly Chinese women and girls as young as 9 years old, of which at
least 20 died.
	   ``We are very concerned that once again, raping women has been
used as a weapon of war,'' Anamah Tan, president of the Singapore
Council of Women's Organizations, told The Straits Times.
	   The rapes were ``organized acts, and not sporadic ones,'' noted
Singapore legislator Dr. Kanwaljit Soin. ``It is a system of using
women to cripple the menfolk.''
	   The main targets of the widespread violence _ which included
looting, vandalism, arson and murder _ were Indonesia's Chinese
minority, who have been traditional scapegoats as they control much
of the country's economy.
	   Neighboring Singapore is predominantly Chinese, and was a refuge
to thousands of ethnic Chinese and foreign residents of Indonesia
fleeing the May riots.
	   Last week, Indonesian President B.J. Habibie formed a separate
independent commission to investigate the rapes, in addition to a
general probe into the rioting and other human rights abuses.
	   Soin argued that the status of these rapes as war crimes should
be discussed by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, whose
foreign ministers are currently meeting in Manila to discuss
regional security issues.
	   In 1996, the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal
ruled that the rapes of Muslim women in Bosnia were gender-related
war crimes.
	   Soin, a vocal proponent of women's rights, added that the
agitators behind the systematic rapes should be punished in
addition to the actual perpetrators, according to the news report.
	   The organized and deliberate nature of the rapes has led to
speculation that a faction of Indonesia's military might have been
responsible.

Coalition likely between party leaders who hate each other

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ With belief high that no party will
win enough votes to control the National Assembly after Sunday's
elections, concerns rose Monday over whether Cambodia can achieve
stability if a coalition is built between three leaders who
intensely dislike each other.
	   Fearing the worst _ that differences could result in fighting _
election officials begged party leaders to consider the interests
of the nation when jockeying for position in a new government.
	   ``I beg them to take into consideration the destiny of the
people and the nation,'' said Kassie Neou, vice chairman of the
National Election Committee overseeing the polling and the slow
counting process Monday.
	   At stake, Kassie Neou said, is peace and Cambodia's
international standing. The country's United Nations seat was left
vacant and membership in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
blocked when strongman Hun Sen deposed his co-prime minister,
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in pitched battles in the capital last
year.
	   Hun Sen is seeking legitimacy through the new vote, though
critics say he has rigged it in his favor, using violence and
intimidation as tools.
	   But with at least 90 percent of the registered voters casting
ballots, the expectation is that opposition parties led by the
prince and former finance minister Sam Rainsy will deny Hun Sen
full victory.
	   Any party with one-third of the seats can block confirmation of
a new government in the 122-member National Assembly. Foreign
observers monitoring the election believe that it is unlikely any
of the three main parties can win even a simple majority.
Thirty-six other parties are also competing, and one or two may
pick up a few seats.
	   Glenys Kinnock, chief of the European Union's observation
mission, has said the three leaders should sit down, put aside
their egos and work together. All say they're willing to cooperate,
but then the conditions begin.
	   Neither Ranariddh nor Hun Sen want a co-premiership again. The
prince says he'll work with Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party, but
not Hun Sen himself.
	   Sam Rainsy, who narrowly escaped death in a grenade attack last
year widely blamed on Hun Sen, says he'd rather sit in opposition
than work under either man, whom he served as finance minister
before he was sacked after complaining too loudly about corruption.
	   Even if Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party topped
the results, few believe that any government can leave out the CPP,
which controls the security forces and has pretty much run the
country since being installed by the harsh Vietnamese military
occupation that followed the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime.
	   Hun Sen, who first came to power in 1985, recently expressed
reluctance about working with either man: ``Why let the tiger into
your house?''

Hyundai workers expand protest against layoffs

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Striking Hyundai Motor Co. workers
expanded their week-long protest against layoffs Monday by
picketing the company's head office in Seoul.
	   Hundreds of helmeted riot police, armed with plastic shields and
meter- (yard-) long batons, guarded Hyundai's headquarters as 300
workers tried to barge into the building.
	   ``Death rather than layoff,'' the workers shouted.
	   After several pushing and shoving contests, the workers, wearing
red headbands bearing the words ``no layoffs,'' began a sit-down
protest on the company's parking lot. They said they planned to
visit government offices to protest.
	   The protesters were among 5,000 Hyundai workers who have been
picketing car assembly lines in Ulsan, 280 kilometers (175 miles)
southeast of Seoul, since last Monday, protesting the company's
plan to lay off 2,678 workers by this weekend.
	   They came to Seoul over the weekend to step up their protest.
	   Hyundai, the nation's leading automaker, said 859 workers took
early retirement in the past week, reducing the number to be laid
off to 1,819. It shed some 5,000 workers in May and June.
	   Hyundai closed its plants last week in anticipation of the
strike, but said it would resume operations Tuesday. The workers
vowed to continue their protest.
	   In an effort to reduce mounting labor complaints, the government
and the nation's top business lobby group, the Federation of Korean
Industries, jointly pledged on Monday to minimize layoffs through
wage cuts and job sharing.
	   Analysts said the pledge was little more than a similar promise
announced earlier this year, and there was no guarantee that
individual companies would follow the guidelines.
	   ``We have heard of the decision. But we have no comment on that.
What we can say right now is that our layoff plan has not
changed,'' said Min Kyong-hwan, a spokesman for Hyundai Motor.
	   Analysts said Hyundai's course of action will affect other major
companies that plan to trim their work forces in the face of
falling sales.
	   South Korea was forced to accept a dlrs 58 billion bailout of
its faltering economy from the International Monetary Fund late
last year.
	   Since then, the number of jobless people has doubled to 1.5
million and is expected to reach 2 million by year's end. One of
the hardest hit sectors is the automobile industry, which has seen
sales drop by more than 50 percent.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar surged against the yen Monday amid
disappointment about the likely shape of the next prime minister's
administration. Tokyo stock prices fell sharply.
	   The dollar bought 142.08 yen in mid-afternoon trading, up 1.54
yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate
of 141.44 yen on Friday.
	   The U.S. currency gained ground against the yen on worry
outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's likely replacement,
Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, will be unable to put Japan's
economy back on track for recovery, traders said.
	   ``The market is getting a little nervous about Obuchi's
leadership, his ability to implement economic policy, as well as
his ability to negotiate with opposition parties,'' said Yukihiko
Hashimoto, a senior foreign exchange manager at Sanwa Bank Ltd.
	   Obuchi was elected to head the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
on Friday, a post which will almost certainly enable him to succeed
fellow LDP member Hashimoto in a Parliamentary vote expected
Thursday.
	   Hashimoto announced he would resign after his ruling LDP
suffered a devastating setback in July 12 elections for the upper
house of Parliament.
	   Traders also signaled concern that Obuchi, known more for his
congeniality than policymaking skills, was reported Monday to be
leaning toward appointing elderly former premier Kiichi Miyazawa as
finance minister.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, meanwhile, share prices posted a
big drop in line with the weakening of the yen and investors' lack
of enthusiasm for an Obuchi-led government, traders said.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average sank 417.53 points, or 2.55
percent, to close at 15,944.36. On Friday, the average closed up
173.88 points, or 1.07 percent.
	   ``Market participants are worried that the choice of Cabinet
members will likely be driven by rivalries among factions (within
the LDP),'' said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager of the stock
division at Chuo Securities Co.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section tumbled 24.03 points, or 1.95 percent, to 1,233.98.
The TOPIX closed up 8.14 points, or 0.65 percent, on Friday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.315 percent from Friday's finish of 1.370 percent,
driving its price up to 111.00 yen from 110.68 yen.

China says it will keep promise to U.S. to detarget missiles

 &UR; Eds: News conference planned at 1130 GMT; will be led &QL;

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ China assured the United States on
Monday it will follow through on its pledge to stop targeting the
13 nuclear missiles it has aimed at U.S. cities, although it did
not say when _ or whether it had already done so.
	   ``The Chinese people are a people who always honor our
commitments,'' Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said during a
meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
	   Their breakfast session was one of a series of separate meetings
Albright had with her counterparts at a conference of Southeast
Asian nations and their Pacific Rim neighbors.
	   She also met with an Indian representative and arranged to
confer later Monday with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   The U.S.-China summit between President Bill Clinton and Chinese
President Jiang Zemin a month ago yielded an agreement to stop
aiming nuclear missiles at each other.
	   China has 18 long-range missiles _ 13 of them aimed at U.S.
cities _ compared with the United States' 6,000 or so nuclear
warheads.
	   The United States has said it has detargeted its missiles that
had been aimed at China and at the former Soviet Union. The issue
may be largely symbolic, because missiles can be retargeted
quickly.
	   During a brief question-and-answer session at the start of a
breakfast between the U.S. and Chinese delegations, Tang was asked
whether China had followed through on the detargeting commitment.
	   ``This has already been decided upon by the two presidents,'' he
replied, expressing surprise that reporters raised the issue.
``According to the ancient Chinese philosophy, the Chinese people
are a people who always honor our promises with real actions,'' he
said.
	   Afterward, a senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the United States did not know yet whether Beijing
had followed through on the promise.
	   ``We expect it will be done,'' he said.
	   Albright told the Chinese delegation she was pleased ``to start
the day with you because we really are, now, real friends.''
	   The senior U.S. official said the nuclear tests by India and
Pakistan were a chief topic of the U.S.-China meeting, and that
both Tang and Albright agreed that the two nations needed to
exercise restraint.
	   Albright also raised the issue of human rights, telling Tang the
United States was concerned about ``recent setbacks,'' including
the arrests of dissidents since Clinton's visit, the official said.
She also raised anew U.S. concerns about Tibet.
	   In later remarks to the annual conference of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, Albright expressed grave concern about the
situation in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, saying, ``With each
passing day the likelihood of a social breakdown _ or explosion _
that would undermine regional stability grows higher.''
	   She spoke as a highway standoff in Yangon, Myanmar, continued
between Aung San Suu Kyi and Myanmar's military government as the
Nobel laureate prepared to spend a third night in her car.
	   Suu Kyi was stopped Friday morning while driving to Bassein, 100
miles (160 kilometers) west of Yangon, to meet members of her
political party.
	   ``Members of legal political parties are being prevented from
traveling in their own country,'' Albright said. ``The Burmese
economy is falling apart ... Burma is a country in great and
growing stress today.''
	   She said the turmoil was posing ``a threat to the stability of
the region.''
	   In her remarks to the annual ASEAN security conference, Albright
said the economic concerns _ as well as the economies _ of the
United States and its Asian partners were linked.
	   ``There are no easy answers'' to resolving the economic crisis,
she said.

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Iranian wrestling, Turkish sight-seer, U.S.
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Instead of Iranian exiles protesting the Tehran
government, there were rows of empty purple seats. And while there
was no walkout this time by Iran's wrestling team, there was
another loss on the mat.
	   A day after a raucous political demonstration jolted the
Goodwill Games' match between the United States and Iran, things
were loud but peaceful Sunday as Turkey beat the Iranian team 16-13
for the bronze medal.
	   Most of the 5,000 seats in the Theater at Madison Square Garden
again were full, except for about six rows in the far left corner
where anti-Tehran protesters sat Saturday night during the United
States' 19-9 victory.
	   Officials said tickets for the seats had been sold and could not
explain the no-shows. A spokesman for the opposition group, Ali
Reza, could not be reached for comment. The phone number he had
been using as a contact was reported out of service.
	   While scores of fans waved the green-white-and-red Iranian flag,
there were no banners supporting the exiles or their leader, Maryam
Rajavi.
	   Mohamed Talaie, whose 128-pound (58.06-kilo) match against
American Tony Purler was delayed by the protest, beat Turkey's
Harun Dogan on a referee's decision in overtime and was cheered
loudly. As he left the mat, Talaie bowed to the crowd.
	   ``I did not pay attention to the fans today,'' Talaie said. ``I
was concentrating on my opponent.''
	   Iran won the first three matches of the meet but got only four
points from the last five matches, on an injury default by Turkey's
Nuri Zengin at 167 pounds (75.75 kilos).
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; HEY, I'M WRESTLIN' HERE! &LR;  A world-class athlete doesn't get
time to see the sights when competing in a strange city. Still,
there's a chance to sample some of the flavor, and Turkish wrestler
Ali Ozen liked his little taste of the Big Apple during the
Goodwill Games.
	   ``I didn't see very much. I went from the hotel to the arena,''
Ozen said after defeating Iran's Abbas Majidi at 187 pounds (84.82
kilos). ``But from what I saw, it is very nice, very lovely and
very lively.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; WORLD CUP FEVER: &LR;  The U.S. women's soccer team has two goals in
its gold-medal meeting today with China _ one immediate, the other
a year off.
	   Coach Tony DiCicco said the Americans want to add the first
Goodwill soccer title to the gold medal they won in the first
Olympic women's tournament in 1996.
	   ``This would be part of the legacy of this team.'' he said.
	   And by winning it at home, DiCicco said, the U.S. team would
have an added advantage when it plays hosts to the Women's World
Cup next summer.
	   ``We wanted to create an aura that it would be difficult to beat
us here,'' he said. ``This is important with the World Cup being
here next year. We don't want China , or any other team, to feel
they can beat us here.''
	   The U.S. team has a 37-game unbeaten streak on home soil.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Guilherme Marques and Para Ferreira of Brazil
beat the U.S. team of Karch Kiraly and Adam Johnson 12-11, 12-4 to
win the gold medal.
	   A near-capacity crowd of 2,800 was charged up early, hoping to
see the 37-year-old Kiraly, who is often mentioned as his sport's
Babe Ruth, Wayne Gretzky or Michael Jordan, add another title to
the 130 he has won over his 12-year career.
	   It started well for the U.S. team, but the Brazilians, the
defending world champions, took control late in the first game and
dominated the second to sweep the best-of-3 match. Martin Conde and
Eduardo Martinez of Argentina beat Julien Prosser and Leo Zahner of
Australia 12-11, 12-9 for the bronze.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The United States won the gold medal in the
two-day mixed team event, easily beating a team of athletes from

Jennie Reed had a first and a second in women's races.

	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Laura Wilkins, a University of Texas
sophomore, won the women's platform gold medal on the final dive.
	   Wilkinson, who was fifth in the platform at this year's World
Championships, defeated three women who beat her in that event,
edging Cai Yuyan of China by just 2.64 points.
	   Dmitry Sautin, the best diver in the world, proved it again,
winning the men's 3-meter springboard by almost 49 points over
American teen-ager Troy Dumais. Sautin, the world champion in
platform and 3-meter and the Olympic platform gold medalist in
Atlanta, never failed to get at least one mark of 8.5 or better on
each of his 11 dives. Zhou Yilin of China won the bronze.

	   Huang, a member of the Chinese men's world champion team, and
Ling rallied on the second rotation to total 39 points. Russia's

Labor official orders PAL to take back fired flight attendants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A Philippine Airlines official said
Monday that the troubled airline can't comply with a labor
official's order to take back 1,400 dismissed flight attendants.
	   Andy Ortega, an officer of the Flight Attendants' and Stewards'
Association of the Philippines, said the union expects PAL
management to carry out the order, which was issued Friday by a
labor arbiter of the National Labor Relations Commission.
	   Labor arbiter Jovencio Mayor told the company to temporarily set
aside its June 15 order laying off 1,400 cabin crew members and to
return them to the payroll.
	   PAL Executive Vice President Manolo Aquino, however, said
management was still studying its response, including a possible
appeal to the Supreme Court.
	   ``They are asking us to physically reinstate the 1,400 (crew
members), which is physically impossible now. We do not have enough
routes to accommodate them,'' Aquino said.
	   The union filed a complaint against unfair labor practices by
the airline when it dismissed 1,400 of the 2,100 cabin crew
members.
	   The flight attendants were among the 5,000 PAL employees let go
by the company following a crippling pilots' strike last month.
	   The ground crew union went on strike last week but went back to
work Sunday after the company agreed to suspend for one month the
retrenchment of 1,800 of its members who were laid off.
	   The union has agreed on the need for retrenchments to save the
airline, and both sides accepted guidelines on how it should be
done.
	   Ortega said the cabin crew union also recognizes management's
prerogative to reduce the number of the airline's nearly 14,000
employees.
	   He said the airline allegedly did not implement a
``last-in-first-out'' procedure provided in their collective
bargaining agreement and instead allegedly targeted wives of
striking pilots and active union officers for dismissal.
	   The union said cost-saving measures, such as leaves and job
rotations, must be exhausted before any crew member is laid off. It
also said that a retrenchment program should contain a recall
provision so that dismissed employees would be rehired in the
future.
	   The pilots' 22-day strike was a devastating blow to the
deteriorating financial condition of the 57-year-old airline,
Asia's oldest.
	   PAL says it is unable to make payments on about dlrs 2 billion
of debt and is discussing a rehabilitation program with Manila's
Securities and Exchange Commission.
	   The plan includes layoffs, the disposal of most of the airline's
planes, and a sharp reduction of flights.

Philippine Airlines says can't comply with reinstatement order
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recasts overline; slight editing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A Philippine Airlines official said
Monday that the troubled airline can't comply with a labor
arbiter's order to take back 1,400 dismissed flight attendants.
	   Andy Ortega, an officer of the Flight Attendants' and Stewards'
Association of the Philippines, said the union expects PAL
management to carry out the order, which was issued Friday by a
labor arbiter of the National Labor Relations Commission.
	   Labor arbiter Jovencio Mayor told the company to temporarily set
aside its June 15 order laying off 1,400 cabin crew members and to
return them to the payroll.
	   PAL Executive Vice President Manolo Aquino, however, said
management was still studying its response, including a possible
appeal to the Supreme Court.
	   ``They are asking us to physically reinstate the 1,400 (crew
members), which is physically impossible now. We do not have enough
routes to accommodate them,'' Aquino said.
	   The union filed a complaint against unfair labor practices by
the airline when it dismissed 1,400 of the 2,100 cabin crew
members.
	   The flight attendants were among the 5,000 PAL employees let go
by the company following a crippling pilots' strike last month.
	   The ground crew union went on strike last week but went back to
work Sunday after the company agreed to suspend for one month the
retrenchment of 1,800 of its members who were laid off.
	   The union has agreed on the need for retrenchments to save the
airline, and both sides accepted guidelines on how it should be
done.
	   Ortega said the cabin crew union also recognizes management's
prerogative to reduce the number of the airline's nearly 14,000
employees.
	   He said the airline allegedly did not implement a
``last-in-first-out'' procedure provided in their collective
bargaining agreement and instead allegedly targeted wives of
striking pilots and active union officers for dismissal.
	   The union said cost-saving measures, such as leaves and job
rotations, must be exhausted before any crew member is laid off. It
also said that a retrenchment program should contain a recall
provision so that dismissed employees would be rehired in the
future.
	   The pilots' 22-day strike was a devastating blow to the
deteriorating financial condition of the 57-year-old airline,
Asia's oldest.
	   PAL says it is unable to make payments on about dlrs 2 billion
of debt and is discussing a rehabilitation program with Manila's
Securities and Exchange Commission.
	   The plan includes layoffs, the disposal of most of the airline's
planes, and a sharp reduction of flights.

Millionaire searching for a wife gets 39,000 replies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY349-350 of July 24 &QL; 
 &UR; By GERALDA MILLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DALLAS (AP) _ Nestled in a secluded section of Dallas sits a
22-room, 10,000 square-foot (900-square-meter) mansion on three
acres (1.2 hectares).
	   In the house adorned with pecan wood floors from a Southern
plantation sits a lonely millionaire bachelor who told the world in
January, one month after his second marriage dissolved, that he is
looking for his third wife.
	   Mike Mullen has his urban estate, his 1,500-acre (600-hectare)
ranch, his two helicopters, his jet, his seaside home on the Gulf
of Mexico, and his winter retreat in Snowmass, Colorado. He even
has the 13-carat diamond ring he plans to place on his betrothed's
finger.
	   Only one thing is missing from Mike's life: the woman of his
dreams.
	   So he did what any American with a story to tell would do: He
went on The Oprah Winfrey Show.
	   On Jan. 26, he told Oprah and her national television audience
he's looking for love. More specifically, he wants a woman who
knows the true meaning of love, devotion and commitment _ toward
him and his 16-year-old daughter and 7-year-old twin sons.
	   Women from around the world heard the oilman's entreaty and
began pouring out their hearts.
	   Some 39,000 letters and packages have bombarded Mike Mullen's
postal box, so many that he's had to hire someone to cull the
responses to pick possible candidates.
	   And he is still looking.
	   ``I'm lonely for having what my parents had,'' says the
48-year-old whose golden touch in business has not been matched by
success in a relationship. He is convinced that, after learning
lessons the hard way, the third time will be a charm.
	   ``I am going to be a hell of a catch for a woman now because of
the fact that I really have arrested some demons in my life,'' says
Mullen. During his failed marriages, both to women named Debby, he
partied and drank too much.
	   He says he married the first time because his friends were
settling down.
	   After graduating from Tulane University, he'd given football a
try, playing in the World Football League for a time. Then he went
to work drilling for oil in Iran and Greece.
	   It was after he moved back to Dallas that he met the woman who
would become Debby Mullen No. 1. All she wanted was to rent his
duplex, but they were engaged within two weeks and married seven
months later. Five years and one daughter later the marriage was
over.
	   Mullen says that at 30 he was emotionally too young to marry.
Debby says he focused on his career, not the marriage.
	   Mullen was managing a bank's dlrs 480 million oil-related loan
portfolio after the drilling business began going dry. In 1986, he
started his own company buying foreclosed assets at bargain prices.
	   About the time his business was taking off, in the early '90s,
Mike met his second wife. They dated for 10 months, broke up, were
reunited at a wedding and soon married.
	   Twins were born, but the couple had problems for years,
sometimes trying to mask their unhappiness with lavish gifts and
trips. ``One of the hardest things sometimes is to realize that you
might have a problem and to just do something about it,'' Mullen
says.
	   In December, that something was divorce.
	   Although Mullen now had his freedom, he still wasn't happy. He
began drinking, though he has now stopped. One of his sons said
recently that Mike is no longer the angry father, which he credits
to his sobriety.
	   ``The acceptance and approval of my children, that to me is the
biggest boost in my arm,'' Mullen says. ``If I can keep them
satisfied, Lord knows I can take on a woman.''
	   Taking on a woman is one thing. Going on national television to
find that woman is another.
	   Oprah was filming her TV talk show in Amarillo while fighting
her veggie libel case when she decided to highlight the lifestyle
of Texas millionaire bachelors.
	   Mullen invited a film crew into his homes to parade his most
prized possessions and toys, then joined Oprah on the set in
Amarillo, bringing along the hulking ring.
	   The response was so overwhelming that Oprah had Mullen on her
show a few weeks later to talk about it _ along with three other
Mike Mullens who had been wrongly blitzed with calls and letters.
	   Dealing with all the correspondence is a full-time job. Mullen
hired Bryan Miller, a 33-year-old attorney, to handle it, and he
has spent almost 200 hours picking possible dates and sending
rejection letters to thousands of women.
	   So what's Mullen looking for?
	   The woman must be educated, but even if she has written ``War
and Peace,'' she stands no chance unless she's good-looking.
	   ``No airhead bimbos allowed,'' attorney Miller says. ``They had
to have beauty inside and out.''
	   So far, Mullen has dated 13 women and about half have been
invited for a second date. Only a Playboy cover model has made it
further.
	   The ex-wives have mixed feelings about Mullen's televised quest.
	   ``Look at all the attention this is getting him,'' Debby No. 1
says. ``He has a huge ego to feed.''
	   Debby No. 2 says she wouldn't have cared except that the Oprah
appearance came only a month after their divorce.
	   ``I think Mike is just having a good time,'' she says.
	   Her advice to the next Mrs. Mullen is to have plenty of energy,
stamina and patience.
	   ``Get ready,'' she says, ``for the ride of your life.''

Taiwan's president calls on China to put aside political disputes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ President Lee Teng-hui on Monday called on
China to put aside its political dispute with Taiwan in order to
concentrate on modernization and democratic reforms.
	   ``Instead of wasting energy to try to settle our political
differences, we might as well work together to achieve the goal of
modernization and create better welfare for our people,'' Lee said
in an address to the National Assembly.
	   ``The true essence of the issue is a race between two systems,''
he said.
	   Lee's comments came as China is stepping up pressure on Taiwan
to hold talks to settle their political differences after gaining
clout from the visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   Clinton was the first U.S. president to state publicly the
policy that the United States would not support Taiwan's
independence or membership in organizations such as the United
Nations.
	   Taiwan is governed by the Nationalists, who fled to the island
after being swept out of the Chinese mainland by the communists in
1949. China regards Taiwan as a renegade province subject to
reintegration by force.
	   Lee urged China to face the political reality of a separate
Taiwan. ``If they deny this reality on purpose, ... it will only
cause damage to peace and to our future cooperation,'' he said.
	   He said Taiwan is concerned more about whether China will ``come
back to the right side of history'' by promoting democracy than
about the U.S. attitude toward Taiwan.
	   Taiwan prefers to resume the dialogue suspended by Beijing in
1995 by focusing on practical matters such as trade and fishing
disputes.
	   Officials say after mutual trust is established, the two sides
can move on to more sensitive political issues.
	   But Chinese negotiator Li Yafei insisted at a meeting with his
Taiwanese counterpart in Taipei on Sunday that the two sides begin
political talks or not resume the dialogue at all.

Japan's vehicle production through June slides
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Production of cars, trucks and buses in Japan for
the first six months of the year slipped 10.5 percent, marking the
first such decline in two years, a Japanese auto association said
Monday.
	   Output in the first half of the year through June fell to 5.1
million units as domestic demand shrank 15.5 percent over the
period to just 3.04 million vehicles, the Japan Automobile
Manufacturers' Association said.
	   Sales of cars and other big-ticket items in Japan have been
chilled by a national sales tax hike last year and a deterioration
in the overall economy.
	   The number of passenger cars manufactured declined 8.5 percent
to 4.04 million in the first six months and truck output slipped
17.7 percent to 1.02 million, the association said.
	   In June alone, production dropped 10 percent to 879,211 vehicles
_ the ninth straight month of declines. The number of passenger
cars made fell 7 percent to 703,978, while truck output tumbled
20.4 percent to 170,792, the auto group said.
	   Sales for the month sank 8.9 percent to 507,687 vehicles, it
said.

In defense policy review, China issues renewed threat on Taiwan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ In its first public defense policy review in
three years, China renewed a threat Monday to retake Taiwan by
force, criticized nuclear tests by India and Pakistan and hinted
that the United States is a potential menace to security.
	   The State Council, or Cabinet, in issuing the review Monday
reiterated that China wants a stable world order to pursue its
primary goal of economic development. It vowed never to attack or
invade unless first attacked.
	   Although it noted an overall easing of tensions worldwide, the
State Council said threats persist. Without naming names, the
policy review assailed ``hegemonism'' _ a euphemism for the United
States and its superpower status _ and the U.S. alliance with
Japan.
	   ``Hegemonism and power politics remain the main source of
threats to world peace and stability,'' the policy paper said.
``Some countries, by relying on their military advantages, pose
military threats to other countries, even resorting to armed
intervention.''
	   The policy review criticized, again without specifying, the
U.S.-Japan security treaty as ``an infringement upon and
interference in China's sovereignty.'' Renewed treaty guidelines
issued last year drew Beijing's anger after a Japanese politician
suggested that the pact covered potential conflicts over Taiwan.
	   China is sensitive about activities that undermine its claim to
Taiwan as a renegade province. Japan ruled the island for 50 years
until its defeat in World War II and the United States backed the
island through much of the Cold War and continues to sell it arms
over Beijing's objections.
	   In keeping with China's usually prickly statements on Taiwan,
the State Council renewed a pledge to seek peaceful unification
with the island but added that Beijing ``will not commit itself not
to resort to force.''
	   While taking issue with India and Pakistan for conducting
nuclear tests, the State Council singled out Delhi for harsher
treatment, criticizing it for ``flagrantly'' defying the
international community. Pakistan is a decades-old ally.
	   If largely a recitation of long-held and oft-repeated positions,
China's first published defense policy review since 1995 was
notable for bringing a modicum of transparency to the largely
secretive workings of the world's largest standing army.
	   Defense officials from the United States and other countries
have urged China to publish more information about the People's
Liberation Army more often to dispel suspicions about Chinese
intentions.
	   The policy paper provided some details on a plan to trim the PLA
by 500,000 to 2.5 million members. Overall the army will shrink 19
percent, the navy 11.6 percent and the air force 11 percent, the
paper said.
	   It also released figures on conventional weapons imports and
exports registered with the United Nations between 1992 and 1996.
The figures show, for example, China imported 48 aircraft and two
naval vessels, but the report does not provide details on the
purchases.
	   Offsetting the small steps toward openness, the report does
little to open the accounts of the PLA. The review noted that last
year's defense budget of 81.3 billion (dlrs 9.8 billion) amounted
to less than 4 percent of what the U.S. spends. It explained that
the budget covers everything from salaries and clothing to research
and procurement.
	   Foreign military analysts have for years disputed the published
figure as ridiculously low given the PLA's sustained foreign buying
spree and missile-development program. Taiwan's Defense Ministry
noted in March that China was spending at least three times the
acknowledged amount on defense.

 &UR; Boston Red Sox 6, Toronto Blue Jays 3

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Nomar Garciaparra hit a three-run inside-the-park
homer, and Pedro Martinez pitched seven scoreless innings Sunday to
lead the Boston Red Sox to a 6-3 victory over the Toronto Blue
Jays.
	   Martinez (14-3) gave up six hits and one walk, he struck out six
and allowed only two batters as far as third base before leaving
with a 5-0 lead. He won for the eighth time in nine starts.
	   Pat Hentgen (9-8) allowed five runs on 10 hits and two walks in
seven innings. He lost his fourth straight decision.
 &UR; Kansas City Royals 9, Anaheim Angels 4
	   At Kansas City, Missouri Jose Offerman extended his hitting
streak to a career-high 15 games with a single during a five-run
first inning and the Kansas City Royals beat the Anaheim Angels.
	   Offerman doubled, singled twice, walked and scored twice. He has
reached base in 16 of his last 22 plate appearances. Dean Palmer
and Jeff Conine each drove in two runs for the Royals.
	   The American League-West-leading Angels fell to 7-15 in July.
Anaheim's Garret Anderson stretched his career-high hitting streak
to 23 games _ one behind Boston's Nomar Garciaparra for the longest
in the AL this season.
	   The Royals had six straight one-out hits in the first against
Omar Olivares (5-7). Jose Rosado (5-8) was the winner.
 &UR; Minnesota Twins 11, Texas Rangers 3
	   At Minneapolis, Todd Walker kept up his tear with four more
hits, including a three-run homer, and the Minnesota Twins beat the
Texas Rangers for their first three-game sweep of the season.
	   Walker, who has reached base in his last 10 plate appearances,
finished the six-game homestand 15-for-20 and raised his average to
.352.
	   Marty Cordova homered and drove in four runs for Minnesota.
	   Juan Gonzalez hit his 31st homer, a two-run shot in the Texas
sixth. His only hit of the series increased his major
league-leading RBIs total to 116.
	   LaTroy Hawkins (7-9) was the winner and Rick Helling (13-6) took
the loss.
 &UR; New York Yankees 6, Chicago White Sox 3
	   At New York, Bernie Williams' tiebreaking solo homer triggered a
three-run sixth inning that carried the New York Yankees over the
Chicago White Sox.
	   David Wells (12-2) allowed three runs and seven hits with 10
strikeouts in 7 2-3 innings, improving to 8-0 in 10 starts at home.
New York is 73-26, the best 99-game start ever for a Yankees team.
They are one win off the pace of the 1902 Pittsburgh Pirates for
the best start this century.
	   Scott Brosius added a two-run single in the sixth to make it 6-3
and finish off White Sox right-hander Jamie Navarro (8-12).
	   Albert Belle hit his 31st home run for the White Sox. Jorge
Posada hit a two-run homer for New York.
 &UR; Seattle Mariners 10, Baltimore Orioles 4
	   At Baltimore, Ken Griffey Jr. stole a career-high three bases
and scored three runs as the Seattle Mariners handed the Baltimore
Orioles their second straight loss.
	   Griffey went 1-for-2 with three walks but did not homer for a
third straight game and remained at 40 for the season. He had 10
steals in 12 attempts before having a perfect day against Baltimore
catcher Lenny Webster.
	   David Segui went 4-for-5 with two RBIs and the Mariners scored
five unearned runs en route to their ninth win in 12 games. Seattle
won the series 2-1 to end the Orioles' string of five straight
series wins.
	   B.J. Surhoff homered for the Orioles, who won 14 of 15 before
losing successive games for the first time since the All-Star
break.
	   Jamie Moyer (8-7) won his third straight decision. Scott
Erickson (11-8) had his three-game winning streak stopped.
 &UR; Detroit Tigers 8, Cleveland Indians 1
	   At Cleveland, switch-hitter Tony Clark hit home runs from both
sides of the plate to help Brian Moehler earn a rare road victory
as the Detroit Tigers beat the Cleveland Indians.
	   Moehler (11-7) allowed one run in 6 2-3 innings. The
right-hander, 9-0 at home, improved to 2-7 on the road.
	   Dwight Gooden (3-6) lost his third straight start.
 &UR; Tampa Bay Devil Rays 3, Oakland Athletics 1
	   At St. Petersburg, Florida, Wilson Alvarez won for the first
time in over two months and Fred McGriff hit a two-run homer as the
Tampa Bay Devil Rays equaled a season-best four-game winning streak
with a victory over the Oakland Athletics.
	   McGriff's third-inning shot off Tom Candiotti (5-13) broke a 1-1
tie. Alvarez (5-8) allowed one run and three hits in seven innings.
	   Mike Blowers snapped an 0-for-27 slump with a second-inning
homer as the A's matched a season-worst six-game losing skid.
	   Esteban Yan pitched two perfect innings for his first career
save.

China warns of threat to security from Asian financial crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ China warned Monday that as East
Asia's financial crisis continues, new problems could emerge to
threaten regional stability.
	   Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, addressing a security
forum hosted by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations,
stressed that economic growth is the ``material basis'' for
regional _ and global _ security.
	   East Asia's financial crisis, he told the ASEAN Regional Forum,
``fully indicates that economic security has increasingly become an
inseparable part of national and regional security.''
	   The crisis ``broke out ferociously ... no less than that of a
war,'' he said.
	   For China, he said, economic security meant safeguarding the
economic sovereignty of the state.
	   Tang, however, called for countries in the region to promote
deeper economic cooperation and, in particular, to take ``strict
precautions'' against excessive currency speculation.
	   It was the devaluation of the Thai baht in July 1997 that
unleashed speculative attacks against several currencies in the
region and started East Asia's now year-old financial crisis.
	   ``Economic security is mutual, and it is inadvisable to try to
shift one's troubles onto others,'' Tang said.
	   Tang's address made no mention of the yuan or the country's
oft-stated commitment not to devalue the Chinese currency.
	   Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, however, said he
believes the economic crisis so far has had little effect on
regional security.
	   On the positive side, he said, many countries have had to reduce
their defense expenditures because of the currency crisis. But that
has been offset by the fact that they also have had to reduce joint
military exercises, which are an important confidence-building
element, he said.
	   In the short term, he said, the greatest risk of the economic
crisis to security is in illegal movements of people seeking jobs.
	   But in the long term, different countries will emerge from the
economic crisis with different levels of success, and that will
lead to shifts in the balance of power, he said.
	   The one-day ARF meeting includes officials from the United
States, China and Russia. ASEAN foreign ministers are to meet
separately with many of the ARF invitees on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Coal miners block Trans-Siberian railway in southern Urals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Coal miners in the southern Ural Mountains blocked
the Trans-Siberian railway Monday to demand back wages, news
agencies reported.
	   About 300 miners have halted freight traffic near the city of
Chelyabinsk, 1,500 kilometers (950 miles) east of Moscow, but are
permitting passenger trains to pass through, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   Coal miners around Russia have taken part in sporadic strikes
and pickets since May, protesting plans to shut their mines and
demanding overdue wages. The protests, usually in the form of rail
blockades, have been concentrated in the central Kuzbass, southern
Donbass and northern Vorkuta coal regions.
	   In the Kuzbass, only one group of miners, in the town of
Osinniki, continues to block a railway, ITAR-Tass has said.
	   The protests have been largely uncoordinated and have not
inflicted significant damage on the economy.
	   But while protests have largely ended in the major coal basins,
strikes have begun in some smaller regions.
	   On the Far Eastern island of Sakhalin, coal miners maintained a
rail and road blockade for a third day on Monday, preventing fuel
deliveries to the region's major power plant, ITAR-Tass reported.
They are demanding eight months' of unpaid wages.
	   The plant has already reduced output, and local authorities have
said fuel supplies will be exhausted in two or three days.
	   The most visible protest is in Moscow, where a group of about
200 miners from Vorkuta have been camped outside the government's
main administration building since early June.
	   The protests have been largely uncoordinated and have not
inflicted significant damage on the economy.

EU warns of economic impact of higher Asian defense spending
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The European Union warned Monday
about the economic burden of increased military spending in
Asia-Pacific countries even after they return to high growth in a
few years.
	   EU Council President Wolfgang Scheussel, addressing a security
forum arranged by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, said
the region probably will have one of the world's highest economic
growth rates at the beginning of the next millennium, despite
current financial disasters.
	   But the EU is concerned that increased prosperity will bring a
return to extravagant military spending.
	   ``A high level of military expenditure _ and this can be seen
clearly when looking at the rising economic difficulties of India
and Pakistan as a consequence of their costly nuclear and
conventional military expenditure _ always constitutes a heavy
burden on the economic development of a country,'' said Scheussel,
who is Austria's foreign minister.
	   He said the EU hoped overall military spending in the region can
be stabilized if not reduced in the near future.
	   Scheussel said Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests ``pose a grave
threat to international peace and security, and constitute a
serious setback to global efforts toward nuclear non-proliferation
and disarmament.''
	   He reiterated an EU appeal to both countries to halt further
tests and sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty.

Rwanda's army says it killed 40 rebels, lost one soldier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Rwandan army said Monday it killed 40
rebels and lost one soldier when it thwarted an attack in the north
of the country, state-run Radio Rwanda reported.
	   The radio said two rebels were wounded and captured on Saturday
when a group of about 100 fighters tried to attack Cyungo in Byumba
Prefecture, about 70 kilometers (40 miles) north of Kigali. Other
rebels apparently escaped.
	   The radio quoted Maj. Dominique Kalisa, an army commander, as
saying the army was taking advantage of last week's killing of two
top rebel commanders in neighboring Ruhengeri Prefecture.
	   Government and army officials said the loss of rebel leaders who
were believed responsible for organizing attacks in which thousands
of civilians died meant the rebel operations were seriously
hampered.
	   Hutu rebels have been launching attacks from the northwestern
forests bordering Congo and Uganda since 1996, when they mixed with
more than 1 million Hutu refugees returning from exile.
	   The rebels are former Hutu soldiers and militiamen responsible
for the 1994 Hutu government-organized slaughter of more than
500,000 minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus.
	   The killing ended when Tutsi-led rebels won power in July 1994.

Thousands attend peaceful opposition rally in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Staffing &QL; 
 &UR; By ALI KOTARUMALOS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 10,000 supporters of opposition
figure Megawati Sukarnoputri staged a peaceful rally Monday to
commemorate a bloody crackdown against her political party in 1996.
	   The rally was one of the biggest political events since the
resignation of former President Suharto in May.
	   It went ahead around Megawati's house in south Jakarta after
police banned plans to stage it in the center of the capital,
citing security concerns.
	   The military said it had put about 9,000 troops and police on
alert in case of trouble. But there was no sign of security forces
at the rally.
	   On Sunday, hundreds of Megawati supporters clashed with members
of a rival political party after a similar commemoration in
Yogyakarta, 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   The opposing mobs tried to set fire to the offices of each
other's party before police intervened.
	   In a sometimes fiery speech to Monday's crowd, which spilled
over into surrounding streets and a nearby field, Megawati
criticized the ban as ``legal harassment.''
	   The ousted head of the Indonesian Democratic Party, or PDI, said
the government of President B.J. Habibie was only paying lip
service to promises of political reform and free speech.
	   ``The ban raises the question of the government's commitment to
total reform,'' she said.
	   With her eye on elections promised for next year, Megawati urged
her supporters to remain non-violent and to obey the law as part of
her campaign for ``truth and justice.''
	   Two years ago, Megawati, the eldest daughter of Indonesia's
founding President Sukarno, gained wide popularity after she
criticized the autocratic policies of Suharto.
	   That led, however, to her ouster as PDI head in June 1996 by
pro-government rivals within the party.
	   Her supporters protested by occupying the party's Jakarta
headquarters. But on July 27, the military and police staged a
predawn raid on the building.
	   The assault triggered major riots. At least five people were
killed and dozens of others were reported missing.
	   The political fortunes of Megawati and other opposition figures
have risen following the resignation of Suharto two months ago
after Indonesia was rocked by student protests and riots amid by
the worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Suharto's successor, Habibie, has promised to reform the tightly
controlled political system and hold free elections next year.
	   Before Monday's peaceful commemoration in Jakarta, about 200
people laid flowers outside the still wrecked PDI headquarters.

Deutsche Bank reports higher profits for first half
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's biggest bank, Deutsche Bank
AG, reported on Monday that operating profit after risk provisions
rose 7 percent to 3.06 billion marks (dlrs 1.72 billion) in the
first half of 1998.
	   Deutsche Bank's operating profit was 2.81 billion marks (dlrs
1.58 billion) in the first half of 1997.
	   The data was largely in line with, or just below, analysts'
expectations. Slightly higher-than-expected risk provisions for the
first half accounted mainly for the difference between some
analysts' forecasts and Deutsche's earnings.
	   Deutsche Bank also said pretax profit rose 65.9 percent to 4.62
billion marks (dlrs 2.6 billion) in the first six months from 2.79
billion marks in the same period a year earlier.

Thai police trying to capture 11 inmates who escaped from prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai police are offering a 10,000-baht
(dlrs 243) reward for information leading to the capture of each of
11 convicts who escaped from a provincial prison, local newspapers
reported Monday.
	   The convicts, most of them drug traffickers, escaped Saturday
from a prison in Loei province, 430 kilometers (270 miles)
northeast of Bangkok, the Bangkok Post said.
	   All the convicts are still at large.
	   Police have set up roadblocks in the province in an effort to
catch the escapees.
	   The Post quoted a prison official as saying the Loei prison is
extremely overcrowded, with 985 inmates crammed into two sleeping
quarters.

Minister says Egyptian-French peace proposal gaining ground
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Monday
there was growing support for a joint Egyptian-French proposal to
rekindle the Middle East peace process.
	   Moussa made the remarks before flying to Paris for two days of
meetings with French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine and other
officials.
	   French President Jacques Chirac and Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak in May called for an international conference to try to
save the Arab-Israeli peace process, which has stalled since the
1966 election of hard-line Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
	   On Sunday, President Hosni Mubarak discussed problems in the
peace process with Syrian President Hafez Assad. He told reporters
after the meeting that an international conference would be
supplementary to U.S. efforts in the region.
	   Moussa told reporters before leaving Cairo that there was
``acceptance on the part of the Arabs and international community
to the Egyptian-French initiative as one of the obvious and
available choices in light of the failure of the negotiations,''
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
	   Palestinian and Israeli negotiations met last week for the first
time in months but were unable to reach agreement on outstanding
issues, including Israel's failure to withdraw from more
Palestinian territory as required by earlier pacts.
	   Before his departure, Moussa met with Farouk Kadoumi, a
Tunis-based PLO leader who has spoken out strongly against the
direction Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have taken.
	   Kadoumi told MENA that he was not optimistic about current
efforts to revive negotiations, characterizing them as ``the last
march toward peace among the dead.''
	   Asked about the French-Egyptian initiative, he said: ``The
current Israeli position will cause everything to fail.''
	   The stalled Middle East peace process also will be discussed by
Arab and Islamic countries participating in a meetings of the
Jerusalem Committee of the Organization of the Islamic Conference
in Casablanca, Morocco.
	   Moussa is among foreign ministers who will attend the sessions
July 29-30.

India, Pakistan nuclear tests, economic crises raised at ASEAN

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Asian and Western nations urged India
and Pakistan on Monday to halt their nuclear weapons programs,
saying they heightened tension in a region already threatened by
instability from an economic breakdown.
	   Ministers from 19 countries plus the European Union were lining
up behind a call for India and Pakistan to cease nuclear tests and
sign international treaties against further proliferation.
	   But India, the 21st member of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations Regional Forum, was holding out against the criticism,
arguing that it had good reasons to conduct the May 11 and 13 tests
``because the non-proliferation regime had turned flawed and
discriminatory.''
	   ``There is only one country putting up any defense of India, and
that is India,'' Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said
after hours of spirited debate during meals and working sessions.
Pakistan is not a member of the annual forum, held to discuss and
defuse issues that could lead to instability in Southeast Asia.
	   Downer, whose country avidly supports the aim of a nuclear-free
Southeast Asia, said there was ``very deep concern about the Indian
and Pakistani nuclear tests and the challenge they have thrown up
to the non-proliferation regime which has served the world so well
for the last 30 years.''
	   The nuclear tension, combined with financial near-collapse or
recession in several East Asian countries, indicates ``we are
meeting at a time characterized more by doubt than by triumph,''
said U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
	   And Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan described the tests as
``plunging South Asia into a sudden wave of tension.''
	   Tang warned that as East Asia's financial crisis continues, new
problems could emerge to threaten regional stability.
	   ``Economic security has increasingly become an inseparable part
of national and regional security,'' he said. The crisis ``broke
out ferociously ... no less than that of a war.''
	   For China, he said, economic security meant safeguarding the
economic sovereignty of the state. He cautioned against excessive
currency speculation.
	   The devaluation of the Thai baht in July 1997 unleashed
speculative attacks against currencies in the region and started
East Asia's now year-old financial crisis.
	   Albright and Japan's prime minister-in-waiting Keizo Obuchi,
representing the world's two largest economies, met on the
sidelines of the forum and pledged major efforts to lift Asia out
of its financial doldrums.
	   Obuchi said his top priorities _ once he is formally promoted
from foreign minister to prime minister later this week _ are
ending Japan's own recession and ``making a contribution to Asia.''
	   He told Albright he would overcome his reputation for
indecisiveness by following through on a campaign pledge to enact a
package of a dlrs 43 billion tax cut and dlrs 71 billion in
government spending, U.S. officials said.
	   Albright said the United States has ``a vital security interest
in speeding Asia's recovery.'' But even with assistance from the
United States and international lending institutions, the road to
recovery is a tough one.
	   ``There is no question the region will recover. ... The real
question is whether it will emerge stronger, more open, more
democratic, better equipped to meet new challenges,'' she said.

Thai army prepares to lend police a hand to suppress narcotic
</HEADLINE>
crime &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Following reports that a hilltribe drug
gang is threatening to kill Thai policemen, a top general offered
Monday to send the Thai army to help.
	   ``We are ready to lend a helping hand,'' Army Commander in Chief
Gen. Chetta Thanajaro told reporters.
	   The Bangkok Post reported Monday that an amphetamine-trafficking
gang of Hmong hilltribesmen has offered to pay 1 million baht (dlrs
23,800) to anyone who kills a member of the anti-narcotics task
force in Tak province, 370 kilometers (230 miles) northwest of
Bangkok.
	   The paper said the gang reportedly is hiring hit men to kill
some of the 100 men in the task force.
	   About 10 days ago, members of the task force arrested several
Hmong for selling amphetamines.
	   That enraged the tribe, and about 200 Hmong villagers battled
with police for several hours. More than 120 Hmong were arrested
and soldiers were brought in to help prevent others from nearby
villages from joining in the melee.
	   Many hilltribes along the Thai-Myanmar border have traditionally
engaged in growing and selling opium, the raw material for heroin.
The problem is still acute in Myanmar, but the Thais have had
success in ending the practice with crop substitution programs.
	   Amphetamine trafficking in the region has skyrocketed during the
past few years as some countries' economies boomed. Abuse of the
drug is widespread in Thailand, where penalties are almost as
severe as for trafficking in heroin.

Fighting rages in northern Sri Lanka, killing 34
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Government troops pressed ahead with
their assault on a rebel stronghold in northern Sri Lanka, with 30
soldiers and four Tamil Tiger guerrillas dying in the battle over
the weekend, the rebels said Monday.
	   The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam said their forces repulsed
the attack on the town of Mankulum, in a statement issued from
their London office.
	   The military did not immediately comment on the fighting 250
kilometers (155 miles) north of the capital, Colombo. Independent
confirmation was not possible because residents fled the area
months ago and the government does not allow reporters there.
	   The army's campaign to seize the largest highway in northern Sri
Lanka has stalled at Mankulam since January, with guerrillas
entrenched in bunkers behind barbed wire raining mortar shells on
government troops.
	   The military already holds two-thirds of the highway, which
links the isolated northern Jaffna Peninsula with the rest of the
government-held areas. The peninsula's 500,000 residents have been
supplied by air and sea since the military captured the area two
years ago.
	   The rebels are fighting for a homeland for the country's
minority Tamils, who make up 18 percent of the population. They
claim the island's majority Sinhalese discriminate against them in
jobs and schooling.
	   More than 54,000 people have been killed since fighting began in
1983.

Indian scientist to sue U.S. university for dismissal over nuclear
</HEADLINE>
tests &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ An Indian scientist plans to sue an
American university that dismissed him in the wake of India's
nuclear weapons tests, his lawyer said Monday.
	   ``To my mind, it is a case of wrongful dismissal,'' said Munir
Visram, a Bombay-based legal adviser to the scientist, who works
for the government's Bhabha Atomic Research Center. ``The letter
from the university specifically says his services were being
terminated because of India's nuclear test.''
	   Since India conducted its tests in May, four nuclear
researchers, including the head of the government's atomic energy
department, have been denied visas to enter the United States and
Britain.
	   Visram would not disclose the name of the scientist or the
university.
	   Visram's client had been invited to join the faculty of an
American university last year to work on a project. He was later
asked to continue working there until December 1998.
	   The U.S. government has asked more than 75 Indian scientists
working in U.S. laboratories on fellowship and exchange programs to
leave the country.

Death toll continues to mount as rescue effort turns to rebuilding
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos SYD101-102 &QL; 
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The discovery of nearly 50 decomposing
bodies near a refugee center prompted officials to expand an
exclusion zone around Papua New Guinea's tsunami disaster area
Monday as the official death toll grew to 2,000.
	   Government spokesman Chris Hawkins said the toll of 2,000 was an
estimate because not all bodies had been physically counted.
	   But the latest figure was not expected to change significantly,
because officers of the Disaster and Emergency Center believe they
have accounted for almost all of the missing, Hawkins said.
	   Emergency center officers had completed a head count in refugee
villages in the disaster area, finding 10,063 people, Hawkins said
from Brisbane, Australia.
	   This figure is greater than the number of people the government
said last week were in the area when the tsunami struck. Hawkins
said the discrepancy occurred because the last census was in 1990
and the government had underestimated population growth.
	   ``What we put it down to is that it has been so long since the
last census and the difficulties in just getting around to all the
refugee villages in the area to make a count of the survivors,''
Hawkins told The Associated Press.
	   ``There has been a lot of confusion.''
	   Three waves hit a 22-mile (35-kilometer) stretch of coast in
West Sepik province on July 17, sweeping four villages into Sissano
Lagoon and sending thousands of survivors fleeing into the jungle.
	   Officials Monday extended an exclusion zone around the lagoon
after a specialist search and rescue unit from Florida using
sniffer dogs discovered 47 bodies near Malol village, where more
than 3,500 survivors and others were being housed.
	   They are now being moved back from the coast to a nearby coconut
plantation, Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio reported.
	   Garrison St. Clair, the U.S. team's logistics commander, said
the concentration of bodies had proved too much for the dogs, which
are trained to react to any signs of human remains. The dogs had
``shut down,'' and at least one will be retired, he said.
	   ``There was too much cadaver. It was overkill. They were not
finding two or three bodies per day, they were alerting to hundreds
of body parts,'' St. Clair said.
	   Police chief Peter Aigilo said Monday he would not hesitate to
forcibly remove people who tried to enter the restricted area.
	   The lagoon remains clogged with bodies caught in impenetrable
mangroves or which are breaking loose from underwater debris and
resurfacing. Shooting of wild pigs and dogs to prevent them
scavenging on bodies has proved futile, and bodies are now being
left to the elements.
	   Meanwhile, the relief coordinators have started considering how
to rebuild villages.
	   The populations of some villages set back from the coast have
more than doubled since the tsunami, placing strain on water
supplies and toilet facilities, rescue officials said.
	   Homeless people sleeping on the ground or under tarpaulins were
drenched by tropical rains overnight, New Zealand military officer
Simon Walsh told the news agency NZPA.
	   Mosquito nets, clothes, kitchen utensils and agricultural tools
were badly needed, he said.
	   Gary Barki, an emergency relief controller in the Aitape village
area, said people want to start rebuilding their lives.
	   ``When I talked to most of these people, they tell me: `We want
bush knives (machetes) so we can cut down trees, make our houses,
make our own gardens.' That's what they want,'' Barki told
Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   The government has set up bank accounts to accept monetary
donations flowing in from around the world, while at least one
organization in Australia is accepting donations of gardening
tools.

More than 100 fires burning in Russia's Far East
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ More than 100 forest fires continue to burn in
Russia's Far East, and more than half are out-of-control, a news
agency said Monday.
	   The fires are particularly severe in the Khabarovsk region,
which is covered by a smoke cloud hundreds of kilometers (miles)
long, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. A state of emergency has been
declared.
	   More than 1,300 fire fighters and 350 bulldozers are battling
the blazes, the report said. Officials are urging residents to
refrain from summer picnics and other outings, since a number of
the fires have been started by carelessness.
	   The Far East has been ravaged by forest fires this summer
because of an unusually dry winter and spring. Specialists say that
without significant rain, the fires may continue until winter.

Rwandan army says it killed 40 rebels

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Government soldiers killed 40 rebels and
lost one of their own when they fought off a guerrilla attack in
northern Rwanda, an official broadcast said Monday.
	   Two rebels were wounded and captured on Saturday when about 100
fighters tried to attack Cyungo in Byumba Prefecture, about 70
kilometers (40 miles) north of the capital, Kigali. Other rebels
apparently escaped, state-run Radio Rwanda reported.
	   Ethnic Hutu rebels have been launching attacks from northwestern
forests bordering Congo and Uganda since 1996, when they mixed with
more than 1 million Hutu refugees returning from exile.
	   The rebels are former Hutu soldiers and militiamen responsible
for the 1994 Hutu government-organized slaughter of more than
500,000 minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus.
	   The killing ended when Tutsi-led rebels won power in July 1994.

Eight killed, four injured in Kashmir clashes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ Soldiers exchanged gunfire with separatist
Kashmiri guerrillas in a fresh round of violence, killing eight
people and wounding four others, officials said Monday.
	   Six people, including a civilian, died Sunday night when Indian
soldiers battled militants in the town of Surankote, 210 kilometers
(130 miles) northwest of Jammu, an army spokesman said on condition
of anonymity. Jammu is the winter capital of Jamu-Kashmir state,
the Himalayan territory claimed by both India and neighboring
Pakistan.
	   Fire engulfed that the building where the militants were
sheltering, the official said. Soldiers later recovered six charred
bodies and identified them as a local civilian, four Pakistani
militants and a fighter from Afghanistan.
	   Another guerrilla and a government soldier were killed in two
additional clashes on Sunday, he said. Four people were injured.
	   India, which is mostly Hindu, regularly accuses Islamic Pakistan
of helping guerrillas fight a proxy war over Kashmir, India's only
majority-Miuslim state. Pakistan says it only gives the rebels
moral support.
	   The guerrillas want Kashmir to become independent or to join
Pakistan. More than 15,000 people have been killed since violence
flared in Kashmir in 1989.

Opposition supporters defy police order, stage rally in Indonesia

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ More than 1,000 supporters of
opposition figure Megawati Sukarnoputri defied a police order and
demonstrated Monday outside a political party headquarters to
commemorate a bloody crackdown against it in 1996.
	   Hundreds of troops and riot police surrounded the office of the
Indonesian Democratic Party, or PDI, the site of a violent clash
between Megawati supporters and troops two years ago. Security
forces also blocked off several streets.
	   There were no reports of arrests or incidents at Monday's
standoff.
	   Many in the crowd shouted ``Long live Megawati'' and chanted
anti-government slogans.
	   Earlier, about 10,000 Megawati supporters, most wearing the
party's red and black colors, staged a peaceful rally around her
house in one of the biggest political events since the resignation
of former President Suharto in May.
	   It went ahead in suburban south Jakarta after police banned
plans to stage it in the center of the capital, citing security
concerns.
	   The military said it had put about 9,000 troops and police on
alert in case of trouble.
	   Hundreds of Megawati supporters later drove in a convoy to the
PDI headquarters, where they were meet by security forces.
	   Hours earlier, about 200 people laid flowers outside the
building.
	   On Sunday, hundreds of Megawati supporters clashed with members
of a rival political party after a similar commemoration in
Yogyakarta, 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   The opposing mobs tried to set fire to the offices of each
other's party before police intervened.
	   In a sometimes fiery speech to Monday's crowd, which spilled
over into surrounding streets and a nearby field, Megawati
criticized the ban on a central Jakarta rally as ``legal
harassment.''
	   The ousted head of the Indonesian Democratic Party, or PDI, said
the government of President B.J. Habibie was only paying lip
service to promises of political reform and free speech.
	   ``The ban raises the question of the government's commitment to
total reform,'' she said.
	   With her eye on elections promised for next year, Megawati urged
her supporters to remain non-violent and to obey the law as part of
her campaign for ``truth and justice.''
	   Two years ago, Megawati, the eldest daughter of Indonesia's
founding President Sukarno, gained wide popularity after she
criticized the autocratic policies of Suharto.
	   That led, however, to her ouster as PDI head in June 1996 by
pro-government rivals within the party.
	   Her supporters protested by occupying the party's Jakarta
headquarters. But on July 27, the military and police staged a
pre-dawn raid on the building.
	   The assault triggered major riots. At least five people were
killed and dozens of others were reported missing.
	   The political fortunes of Megawati and other opposition figures
have risen following the resignation of Suharto two months ago
after Indonesia was rocked by student protests and riots amid by
the worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Suharto's successor Habibie has promised to reform the tightly
controlled political system and to hold free elections next year.

Moderate quake shakes northern China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A mild earthquake on Monday shook a north China
county flattened by a powerful winter quake, but caused no damage
or casualties, government seismologists said.
	   The earthquake, with a preliminary magnitude of 4.6, hit
Zhangbei County, just north of the Great Wall in Hebei province, at
around 9:15 a.m. (0115 GMT), the official Xinhua News Agency
reported.
	   Seismologists described the quake as an aftershock of the
6.2-magnitude earthquake on Jan. 10 that killed 50 people and left
44,000 to suffer through the bitterly cold winter living in tents.
	   Xinhua said the tremor could be felt as far away as Beijing,
more than 200 kilometers (120 miles) to the south.

 &UR; Rebels: fighting rages in northern Sri Lanka, killing 34 &QL;

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Sri Lankan government troops pressed
ahead with their assault on a northern rebel stronghold, with 30
soldiers and four Tamil Tiger guerrillas dying in the battle over
the weekend, the rebels claimed Monday.
	   The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam said their forces repulsed
the attack on the town of Mankulum, in a statement faxed to New
Delhi from their London office.
	   The military did not immediately comment on the fighting 250
kilometers (155 miles) north of the capital, Colombo. Independent
confirmation was not possible because residents fled the area
months ago and the government does not allow reporters there.
	   The army's campaign to seize the largest highway in northern Sri
Lanka has stalled at Mankulam since January, with guerrillas
entrenched in bunkers behind barbed wire raining mortar shells on
government troops.
	   The military already holds two-thirds of the highway, which
links the isolated northern Jaffna Peninsula with the rest of the
government-held areas. The peninsula's 500,000 residents have been
supplied by air and sea since the military captured the area two
years ago.
	   The rebels are fighting for a homeland for the country's
minority Tamils, who make up 18 percent of the population. They
claim the island's majority Sinhalese discriminate against them in
jobs and schooling.
	   More than 54,000 people have been killed since fighting began in
1983.

With fanfare, Indonesia prepares to reduce troops in East Timor

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ In a pair of coastal towns in East Timor,
crude wooden crosses mark the spots where pro-independence
demonstrators were shot by Indonesian forces in recent weeks.
	   They testify to the bitterness that many East Timorese feel for
the Indonesian military, which invaded the former Portuguese colony
in 1975 and crushed most armed resistance.
	   Fighting, famine and disease killed tens of thousands of people.
	   Now, steering toward a solution to the conflict, Indonesia's
reform-minded government says it is pulling out some of the 12,000
soldiers who patrol the rugged, half-island territory of 800,000
people.
	   The military, long accused of sweeping human rights abuses,
hasn't said how many will go. Unconfirmed reports say about 1,000
will leave the territory, 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) east of
Jakarta.
	   In a heavily hyped event, the troops will assemble Tuesday for a
farewell ceremony in Dili, East Timor's capital, before boarding
ships bound for military barracks in less volatile regions.
	   At a demonstration Monday in the coastal town of Baucau, 100
kilometers (60 miles) east of Dili, pro-independence activists
welcomed the gesture even though it falls short of their desire for
a vote on self-determination for their homeland, declared part of
Indonesia in 1976.
	   ``We're glad because the presence of the Indonesian armed forces
makes us unhappy,'' said Nuno Carlo, a 25-year-old political
science student from the Indonesian-built University of East Timor.
``We're suppressed and interrogated whenever we try to hold a
protest.''
	   Sitting in rows in an indoor sports stadium, some protesters
hoisted pictures of Xanana Gusmao, East Timor's imprisoned rebel
leader and a symbol of the struggle to shed Indonesian control.
	   The military has announced troop cutbacks in the past, but
critics say it was just moving garrisons around without really
reducing numbers. About half the soldiers in East Timor are
indigenous and likely to stay in their native land.
	   Still, the timing of this pullout is significant.
	   On Friday, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen arrives in
Jakarta for high-level weekend talks with Indonesian officials,
including President B.J. Habibie.
	   And, on Aug. 4-5 in New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
and the foreign ministers of Indonesia and Portugal will resume
long-running negotiations on how to end more than two decades of
conflict.
	   Habibie, who has proven adept at publicity since replacing his
disgraced predecessor, Suharto, in May, clearly intends the partial
troop withdrawal as a high-profile gesture to symbolize his desire
to bring peace to East Timor.
	   While a sizable troop cutback could ease tensions, it fails to
address the major sticking point: East Timor's political future.
	   Indonesia maintains East Timor is its 27th province _ something
that the United Nations, Portugal and many other governments do not
recognize.
	   Habibie is promoting Indonesia-wide democratic reform, but rules
out relinquishing control of East Timor.
	   Instead, he has offered an undefined measure of autonomy and the
release from a Jakarta prison of Gusmao in return for international
recognition of Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor.
	   He also has rejected demands by anti-Indonesian activists for a
vote on independence.
	   A troop cutback will probably do little to hinder Indonesia's
tight hold in East Timor. There are only a few hundred separatist
guerrillas hiding out in the hills and they have not clashed with
the military in more than two months.
	   East Timor's pro-independence movement has chosen to focus less
on a military confrontation it cannot win, pouring resources
instead into a spirited publicity battle in the United Nations and
other international forums. East Timorese activists are vocal in
Portugal, Australia and the United States.
	   ``They're winning the game,'' acknowledged army Lt. Col. Supadi
at military headquarters in Dili.
	   Further sullying their image, Indonesian security agents shot
and killed two demonstrators and wounded several others during
protests staged to impress visiting European ambassadors last
month. One man was gunned down in Manatuto village and another in
Baucau.
	   Now the Indonesian military is trying to overhaul a reputation
tarnished over the years by widespread accounts of human rights
abuses not only in East Timor but elsewhere in the nation of 202
million.
	   However, news of a troop withdrawal does not sit well with all
in East Timor, particularly settlers from other Indonesian islands
who complain of harassment by the indigenous population.
	   ``They ask for the fish without paying or pay less than the
normal price,'' said Majit Turni, a 25-year-old fisherman from
Sulawesi island, as he painted his boat on the shore near Dili.
``That's why we need protection from the military.''

Daimler, Nissan to cooperate on building light trucks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Daimler-Benz AG, Germany's largest
industrial group, and Nissan Diesel Motor Co. of Japan announced
Monday they would jointly build a light truck starting in 2002 for
the Asian market.
	   At simultaneous news conferences in Tokyo and Stuttgart, the
companies said they hoped to be producing 150,000 trucks a year by
2005.
	   ``This cooperation will be an important step to expanding our
truck business in Asia,'' Daimler chairman Juergen Schrempp said in
a statement. ``It will form an integral component of our Asia
strategy.''
	   Daimler and Nissan's troubled truck division have been in talks
for months about a possible alliance or joint venture.
	   Daimler has been looking to strengthen its global market
position as the auto industry consolidates.
	   Its purchase of Chrysler, announced in May, will expand its
presence in the U.S. market. And the company has said it wants to
raise its market share in Asia within the next 10 years from the
current 8 percent or 9 percent to at least 20 percent.
	   Nissan Diesel has been battered by slumping domestic consumption
and Asia's economic crisis. Nissan Motors reportedly wants to sell
most of its 39 percent share in the truck maker because of the
heavy cost of keeping the affiliate afloat.

Georgian president says new Cabinet is needed to conduct new
</HEADLINE>
reforms &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze
confirmed Monday that most of his Cabinet will resign shortly to
clear the way for a major government reshuffle.
	   Shevardnadze accepted the resignation of the country's No. 2
leader on Sunday. He explained that decision in his regular radio
address on Monday, saying Georgia's reforms are entering a new
phase and ``a changeover of the Cabinet is needed.''
	   He praised former State Minister Niko Lekishvili, saying he
showed courage by being the first to offer his resignation, even
though he deserved more than others to retain his job.
	   ``As to the Cabinet in general, I expect each member to take a
decent decision,'' Shevardnadze said. ``Many of them, maybe even
the majority, will retain their posts.''
	   He said he expects the Cabinet reshuffle to take several weeks,
likely ending in mid-August.
	   Georgia suffers from many of the same economic woes as other
former Soviet republics, plus it is battling separatists in the
Black Sea province of Abkhazia.

Austrian official travels to Lithuanian and Latvia on EU mission
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- A senior Austrian official travels
Tuesday to Lithuania and Latvia for talks on political and economic
issues related to the desire of the two former Soviet republics to
join the European Union.
	   The two states are among five countries which would like to join
the community in the second expansion round.
	   On the eve of her visit, State Secretary Benita Ferrero-Waldner
said she would discuss a ``series of political and economic''
issues regarding EU entry during her brief stops.
	   Austria currently holds the EU presidency and is keenly
interested in EU expansion to the countries of Eastern Europe with
which it has longtime cultural and historical links.
	   In recent weeks, Ferrero-Waldner visited Romania and Bulgaria
and will hold talks in Slovakia on Aug. 4.
	   In Lithuania, the first stop, she will confer with Foreign
Minister Algirdas Saudargas and the chairman of the committee for
European integration, Petras Austrevicius.
	   She plans to donate 15 copies of Stefan Zweig's ``The World of
Yesterday'' to the Austrian library in the Lithuanian capital,
Vilnius.
	   In Latvia she will meet Foreign Minister Valdis Birkavs and
members of the parliamentary committee on Europe.
	   During a radio interview Monday, Ferrero-Waldner said the
process of EU expansion must be seen as ``a transparent process.''
She said the EU was prepared to assist all European candidate
states finally so they can meet the conditions of membership.
	   She described Lithuania and Latvia as ``important partners'' for
Austria and the rest of the EU. She also underscored the importance
of good relations between the Baltic states and Russia.
	   Of the three Baltic states which applied for EU membership in
1995, only tiny Estonia was accepted for entry in the first
expansion round.
	   The major obstacles to Lithuanian and Latvian membership have
been economic problems as well as tensions with Moscow over the
treatment of the Russian minority still living in their territories
after the breakup of the Soviet Union.

Japanese stocks fall sharply, dollar surges in Tokyo

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index tumbled to
its lowest level in nearly a month Monday amid worries that Japan's
incoming administration won't be able to revive the economy. The
U.S. dollar soared against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average sank 417.53 points,
or 2.55 percent, closing at 15,944.36 _ its first close below
16,000 since June 30. On Friday, the average had gained 173.88
points, or 1.07 percent.
	   Investors worried that outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto's likely replacement, Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, is
ill-suited to push through tough reforms needed to reverse the
sagging economy, traders said.
	   ``We need someone to come in with a chain saw,'' said Louis
Tseng, head of the Tokyo derivatives department at Jardine Fleming
Securities Co. ``Not only does (Obuchi) not have a chain saw, he
may not even have a hacksaw.''
	   Obuchi was elected to head the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
after the stock market closed last Friday. That post almost
certainly will enable him to succeed fellow LDP member Hashimoto.
	   Parliament was expected to vote Obuchi into office on Thursday.
Hashimoto announced he would resign after his party suffered a
devastating setback in July 12 elections for the upper house.
	   There also were concerns about his likely Cabinet. Obuchi was
reported Monday to be leaning toward appointing elderly former
Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa as finance minister.
	   ``Market participants are worried that the choice of Cabinet
members will likely be driven by rivalries among factions (within
the LDP),'' said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager of the stock
division at Chuo Securities Co.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section tumbled 24.03 points, or 1.95 percent, to 1,233.98.
It had climbed 8.14 points, or 0.65 percent, Friday.
	   An estimated 378 million shares changed hands on the first
section, down from 401 million Friday. Declines outnumbered gains
949 to 218, with 125 issues closing unchanged.
	   Meanwhile, the dollar bought 142.34 yen in late afternoon, up
1.80 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York
rate of 141.44 yen Friday.
	   The U.S. currency gained against the yen amid growing unease
about an Obuchi-led government and concern over the plunge in Tokyo
stock prices, traders said.
	   ``The market is getting a little nervous about Obuchi's
leadership, his ability to implement economic policy, as well as
his ability to negotiate with opposition parties,'' said Yukihiko
Hashimoto, a senior foreign exchange manager at Sanwa Bank Ltd.
	   The dollar ranged between 141.40 yen and 142.45 yen in Monday's
trading.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.315 percent from Friday's finish of 1.370 percent,
driving its price up to 111.00 yen from 110.68 yen.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ More than 1,000 supporters of
opposition figure Megawati Sukarnoputri defied a police order and
demonstrated Monday outside a political party headquarters to
commemorate a bloody crackdown against it in 1996.
	   Hundreds of troops and riot police surrounded the office of the
Indonesian Democratic Party, or PDI, the site of a violent clash
between Megawati supporters and troops two years ago. Security
forces also blocked off several streets.
	   There were no reports of arrests or incidents at Monday's
standoff.
	   Many in the crowd shouted ``Long live Megawati'' and chanted
anti-government slogans.
	   Earlier, about 10,000 Megawati supporters, most wearing the
party's red and black colors, staged a peaceful rally around her
house in one of the biggest political events since the resignation
of former President Suharto in May.
	   It went ahead in suburban south Jakarta after police banned
plans to stage it in the center of the capital, citing security
concerns.
	   The military said it had put about 9,000 troops and police on
alert in case of trouble.
	   Hundreds of Megawati supporters later drove in a convoy to the
PDI headquarters, where they were meet by security forces.
	   Hours earlier, about 200 people laid flowers outside the
building.
	   On Sunday, hundreds of Megawati supporters clashed with members
of a rival political party after a similar commemoration in
Yogyakarta, 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   The opposing mobs tried to set fire to the offices of each
other's party before police intervened.
	   In a sometimes fiery speech to Monday's crowd, which spilled
over into surrounding streets and a nearby field, Megawati
criticized the ban on a central Jakarta rally as ``legal
harassment.''
	   The ousted PDI head said the government of President B.J.
Habibie was only paying lip service to promises of political reform
and free speech.
	   ``The ban raises the question of the government's commitment to
total reform,'' she said.
	   With her eye on elections promised for next year, Megawati urged
her supporters to remain non-violent and to obey the law as part of
her campaign for ``truth and justice.''
	   In the city of Solo, about 500 kilometers (310 miles) east of
Jakarta, more than 7,000 Megawati supporters staged a peaceful
street march Monday.
	   Two years ago, Megawati, the eldest daughter of Indonesia's
founding President Sukarno, gained wide popularity after she
criticized the autocratic policies of Suharto.
	   That led, however, to her ouster as PDI head in June 1996 by
pro-government rivals within the party.
	   Her supporters protested by occupying the party's Jakarta
headquarters. But on July 27, the military and police staged a
predawn raid on the building.
	   The assault triggered major riots. At least five people were
killed and dozens of others were reported missing.
	   The political fortunes of Megawati and other opposition figures
have risen following the resignation of Suharto two months ago
after Indonesia was rocked by student protests and riots amid by
the worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Suharto's successor Habibie has promised to reform the tightly
controlled political system and to hold free elections next year.

Asian referees to discuss back tackle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Soccer's back tackle rule, which
resulted in a red card spree at the recent World Cup, will be among
the main topics at the Asian Football Confederation's seminar for
referees next month.
	   The seminar would give Asian referees an opportunity to analyze
the performance of match officials at the World Cup, an AFC
official was quoted as saying by the Malaysian national news
agency, Bernama.
	   The Aug. 1-3 seminar for referees and officials also will
discuss new rules, including the one on back tackles, which was
implemented during the World Cup finals in France, the official
said.
	   The back tackle rule saw referees flashing red cards liberally
during the final rounds.
	   ``There were controversies during the World Cup about the back
tackle rule. ... The referees will have a chance to gauge for
themselves whether the decision taken was right and appropriate,''
said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   AFC Referees Committee Chairman Farouk Bouzo will conduct the
three-day seminar.
	   There were four Asian referees and five assistant referees at
the World Cup in France.

Russia begins military exercises near Chechnya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia launched military exercises in the Caucasus
region on Monday in an effort to stem increasing violence in its
restive southern republics of Chechnya and Dagestan, a news agency
reported.
	   The exercises follow President Boris Yeltsin's recent overtures
of support for Chechnya's government and his decision to have Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko resume negotiations with the president of
the secessionist republic this week.
	   The military maneuvers, which run until Friday, are designed to
tighten coordination between various forces to fight terrorist
attacks, free hostages, and combat smuggling _ exactly the sort of
incidents on the rise in Russia's fringe republics.
	   ``Measures aiming to maintain law and public order in the region
should be comprehensive and carried out according to a single
plan,'' said Russian Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin, according
to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Still, Stepashin said the exercises ``do not mean that somebody
is preparing for some massive combat action'' in the region.
	   Chechnya and Dagestan have been plagued recently by a rise in
kidnappings for ransom, killings, and theft. Maskhadov, who
declared a state of emergency in Chechnya last month, narrowly
escaped a car bomb last Thursday that killed two of his bodyguards.
	   Forces taking part in the exercises include the Interior
Ministry, the Border Guard Service, the Federal Security Service,
and troops stationed around Stavropol, 1,200 kilometers (750 miles)
south of Moscow.
	   Yeltsin has ordered Kiriyenko to meet this week with Maskhadov
to demonstrate support for his government, even though the Chechen
president led a 1994-96 war for independence from Russia that ended
in political deadlock.
	   ``The simple fact of this meeting is very important,'' Ivan
Rybkin, Russia's top negotiator with the Chechens, told the
Interfax news agency. ``After a long break, negotiations between
Moscow and Grozny will occur at a high level. In that period, many
bitter problems have accumulated that can be destroyed only by the
leaders of Russia and Chechnya.''
	   A total of six people have been arrested so far in connection
with the car bomb attack on Maskhadov, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said.

Fire kills eight people in pub
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Fire raged through a pub in northern
Taiwan before dawn Monday, killing eight people in what police said
was an apparent arson attack.
	   Another 12 people were injured as they jumped from the
second-story pub in Hsinchu city because the stairway was blocked
by the blaze, police said. Hsinchu is 100 kilometers (90 miles)
south of Taipei.
	   Police quoted witnesses as saying several customers started the
fire by tossing a gasoline bomb at the stairway leading to the pub
after a brawl with other patrons.
	   Another gasoline bomb was hurled at a motorbike parked outside
the building, witnesses said.
	   Four people were hospitalized with serious burns, police said.
	   In 1995, 11 people were killed in a karaoke club in Taipei in
the worst arson attack in Taiwan.

Palestinians reject reported Israeli withdrawal proposals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is trying to bring the Palestinians back
to the negotiating table with proposals for joint security control
of a small area in the West Bank, Israeli media reports said
Monday.
	   But Palestinian officials said they would not consider any
proposals that were not in line with a U.S. initiative for an
Israeli withdrawal from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Israel has refused to accept the American initiative, and talks
on the long overdue troop withdrawal have been deadlocked for
months.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Mahmoud Abbas,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's top deputy, met secretly
Saturday night in an effort to restart the talks. A spokesman for
Mordechai said talks would resume soon, and Israeli media reports
said the Palestinians had agreed to rejoin the talks after hearing
concessions presented by Mordechai.
	   Israel has balked at turning over more than 10 percent more of
the West Bank to the Palestinians before a final peace settlement
is reached. But the Maariv newspaper said Mordechai told Abbas that
Israel was willing to share security control with the Palestinians
in another 3 percent, and that the 3 percent would be on contiguous
land _ near Bethlehem in the Judean Desert.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, speaking Monday on Israel
Radio, said there had been no agreement on the 3 percent or any
other matter.
	   ``We are discussing various suggestions, but no agreements have
been reached,'' he said.
	   He said, however, that there had been a decision to restart the
talks.
	   Palestinian negotiators, however, said the talks would not
resume until the Israelis brought new ideas that did not contradict
the American proposal.
	   Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to Arafat, said Monday that the reported
3 percent proposals were not new and not in line with the U.S.
proposal.
	   ``If these are the ideas they bring to the Palestinian side,
then Netanyahu is sentencing the talks to failure,'' he told The
Associated Press.
	   Tibi said no new talks on the redeployment were scheduled,
although Abbas was to meet Monday night with Israeli police
minister Avigdor Kahalani to discuss other issues of
Israel-Palestinian relations.

	   EDEWECHT, Germany (AP) _ Nine onlookers at a race in northern
Germany were injured when the turbine on one souped-up tractor
exploded, spraying metal pieces into the crowd, police said Monday.
	   One of the nine injured was in critical condition, police said.
	   A Dutch racer had covered only about 75 meters (250 feet) when
one of two aircraft turbines on his tractor exploded. His vehicle
was impounded and would be examined, police said.
	   The race was called off after the accident.

 &UR; DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Session ends without constitutional change &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ A constitutional change
allowing presidents to be re-elected appeared doomed as the
Dominican legislature ended its last regular session Sunday.
	   A newly elected legislature dominated by the Dominican
Revolutionary Party takes office Aug. 16, and it is expected to
block any amendment that might allow Dominican President Leonel
Fernandez a second term.
	   Fernandez could call a special session to consider the measure,
but observers said it was unlikely Congress would act on it.
	   ``We have to face reality, and it appears that the
constitutional reform is not going to be a possible,'' said Jose
Tomas Perez, publicity director for Fernandez's Dominican
Liberation Party.
	   The government put the one-term limit on the presidency in 1994
to limit the power of outgoing president and longtime political
strongman Joaquin Balaguer.
	   Since Fernandez's election in 1996, his party has been
frustrated in its attempts to push through free-market reforms.
Fernandez had hoped to get a second chance in 2000.
 &UR; CUBA: Revolutionary veterans keep the faith
	   GRANJITA SIBONEY, Cuba (AP) _ The ragtag rebels who launched the
Cuban revolution 45 years ago Sunday have returned to the revolt's
cradle to help strengthen the resolve of a people in a troubled
hour.
	   Some of Castro's first followers returned to Granjita Siboney,
the farming village where they spent the night before the 1953
attack on the Moncada barracks that began the uprising, to tell
schoolchildren about the battle and to urge them not to lose faith
in the revolution.
	   ``When we were your age we didn't have even a tenth of what you
now have,'' Pedro Gutierrez, 69, told the children. ``We feel very
proud to have put our grain of sand into defeating the dictatorship
and helping to bring us everything that we have today.''
	   The children craned their necks and listened attentively to the
men who have become national heroes.
	   ``After hearing their words we are more clear about what
happened on that day _ and about what has been happening since
then,'' 13-year-old Ramon Enrique Suarez said.
	   Suarez and 91 other children, selected for their patriotism and
academic achievements, staged a symbolic reenactment of the attack
before dawn Sunday, rushing the barracks in mustard yellow uniforms
and toy rifles as thousands of people looked on.
 &UR; CUBA: 10 shipwrecked Cubans rescued, brought to Mexico
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Ten Cubans whose boat broke up at sea while
en route to the Florida coast were rescued by a passing ship and
brought to a Mexican port in Tamaulipas state, a report said
Sunday.
	   A Cypriot vessel picked up the seven men, two women and a boy
and carried them to Altamira on Friday, the daily La Jornada
reported. The Cubans, who said they wanted to go to the United
States to improve their economic situation, expected they would be
returned to Cuba.
	   The group's fiberglass launch had left Cuba on July 18, a port
official told the newspaper.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Production of cars, trucks and buses in Japan
slipped 10.5 percent in this year's first six months, the first
such decline in two years, a Japanese auto association said Monday.
	   Output for January-June fell to 5.1 million vehicles as domestic
demand shrank 15.5 percent to 3.04 million, the Japan Automobile
Manufacturers' Association said.
	   Sales of cars and other big-ticket items in Japan have been
chilled by a national sales tax increase last year and a
deterioration in the overall economy.
	   The number of passenger cars manufactured declined 8.5 percent
to 4.04 million in the first six months and truck output slipped
17.7 percent to 1.02 million, the association said.
	   In June alone, production dropped 10 percent to 879,211 vehicles
_ the ninth straight month of decline. The number of passenger cars
fell 7 percent to 703,978, while truck output tumbled 20.4 percent
to 170,792, the auto group said.
	   Sales for the month sank 8.9 percent to 507,687 vehicles, it
said.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Bankruptcies and business closures are rising
in Singapore as its vulnerable economy stalls, job losses increase
and fatalism sets in, according to a news report Monday.
	   Personal bankruptcies rose 20 percent from a year earlier to 986
in the first half of 1998, of which 41 percent were due to failed
businesses and 16 percent to job losses, The Straits Times
reported.
	   Company closures also jumped 18 percent to 125 liquidations in
January-June this year from 106 in the first half of 1997.
	   Small to medium enterprises fared worst, with 42 percent of
these closures among companies with paid-up capital of between
100,000 and 500,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs 58,000 and 291,000).
Most of the 125 liquidations were companies in the commerce,
construction and manufacturing sectors.
	   Singapore's economy, though spared the brunt of economic
catastrophe striking some of its neighbors, has nevertheless slowed
significantly since the onset of the Asian crisis.
	   The government recently slashed the growth forecast for 1998 to
between 0.5 and 1.5 percent, and the prime minister has warned that
a recession is likely next year.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Despite a global slowdown in the electronics
sector, the Singapore-based regional arm of German giant Siemens AG
predicts continued growth in orders for its semiconductor chips and
shipments from its Asian plants this year.
	   Siemens Components Pte. Ltd. managing director Loh Kin Wah told
Dow Jones Newswires on Monday the company isn't slowing its
investments in its semiconductor test and assembly plants in
Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and China.
	   He said that unlike other semiconductor companies operating in
the region, Siemens has been insulated from the severe global
electronics downturn because it has very little exposure to the PC
and consumer segments of the industry, businesses most affected by
the slowdown.
	   The company's Asian factories test and assemble logic chips,
semiconductors designed to perform specific functions like operate
a industrial machine.
	   But he warned that in Singapore, the relative strength of the
local currency and the lack of experienced staff could limit their
business growth.
	   He said some of the Singapore production capacity will
progressively be transferred to neighboring Batam, Indonesia, as
the company upgrades the technology of the plants there.
	   Despite this, Loh said Siemens will invest an additional dlrs 40
million in its Singapore factories, primarily for higher-end
machinery and increased value-added production.
	   Siemens Components' regional headquarters is based in Singapore
and includes the manufacturing plant and a regional sales and
marketing unit.
	   The company also maintains the Batam site, which can accommodate
up to four factories, two Malaysian plants in Malacca and Penang,
and one in the central Chinese city of Wuxi.
	   Siemens' expansion in Southeast Asia also includes a proposed
additional investment of dlrs 10 million to dlrs 15 million over
the next year in its Batam operations, and a dlrs 5 million
expansion in manufacturing space in its Wuxi plant.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong Telecommunications, one of the
Chinese territory's largest employers, laid off 270 managers
Monday, adding to Hong Kong's growing jobless toll.
	   A company statement said the layoffs were necessary in an
``increasingly competitive market environment and ahead of further
liberalization in the telecommunications market next year,'' it
said.
	   Union officials were quoted Sunday as saying that the company
planned to cut its work force by 1,000 throughout early retirement
or by leaving voluntarily.
	   Ip Kwok-fun, chairman of one of the unions, told state-run radio
that the 270 managers had agreed to leave in exchange for buyouts.
The company statement said it paid the workers 100 million Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 12.8 million).
	   Hong Kong's Labor Department has set up a hot line for the
workers.
	   Analysts said the news isn't entirely unexpected as the company
faces a slowdown in traffic due to the Asian economic crisis.
	   Company shares were down 1 percent to 14.50 Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 1.86) just before the midday close Monday.
	   The government announced last week that unemployment had hit a
15-year high of 4.5 percent.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq on Monday accused the United States
and American-backed Iraqi opponents of being behind an explosion in
Baghdad last week.
	   A car exploded in the parking lot of Baghdad's Al-Rasheed Hotel
on Friday, causing minor damage and no injuries.
	   There has been no claim of responsibility.
	   Al-Thawra, which is published by the ruling Baath party, charged
in an editorial on Monday that the United States was behind the
blast.
	   It cited recent reports from Washington that the Clinton
administration has asked Congress to fund covert operations against
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
	   ``Reports say that the American administration has paid money
for the so-called opposition to carry out political, media and
secret operations against Iraq and its people,'' said newspaper
said.
	   It added that the explosion at the Al-Rasheed ``is one of the
activities which those agents were to carry out.''
	   It did not cite any evidence for the allegation.
	   Al-Thawra said it expected further violence by Iraqi opponents
of the regime, saying: ``We expect the explosion to be the
beginning of other terrorist acts in order to utilize the payment
from their American and Zionist masters.''
	   The paper said the Clinton administration was resorting to plots
against the Iraqi regime ``to cover their failure'' to bring Iraq
to its knees with sanctions.
	   It was a reference to stringent U.N. trade sanctions imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The United States and Britain have led the fight in the U.N.
Security Council to keep the sanctions in place until Iraq has
eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The paper said that now that there is rising support in the
United Nations for lifting the sanctions, the Americans were
adopting ``this dirty, cowardly way'' to punish Iraq.
	   ``What they must know is that Iraq is not one of the banana
republics, and if this method has worked with these republics, it
will not work with Iraq,'' the editorial concluded.
	   It urged the United Nations to investigate the alleged American
involvement in the incident.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An unidentified metal box exploded Monday as two
rail workers tried to remove it from a train car in southern
Russia, a news report said. One worker was killed and the other was
seriously wounded.
	   The incident occurred after 6 a.m. outside the main rail station
in the city of Rostov-on-Don, 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) south of
Moscow, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The box was discovered during a routine inspection of the train
at a depot outside the station, the report said. When the workers
attempted to carry it out, it exploded.
	   The cause of the explosion has not been determined, ITAR-Tass
said. An investigation was underway.

Polish premier takes over European ministry to improve its

functioning &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland's premier took over the
chairmanship Monday of the ministry for European integration, which
has been troubled by charges of incompetence and internal
bickering.
	   Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek told Polish public radio that it was
``extraordinarily important for defending'' Poland's vital
interests that the ministry, which is supposed to be preparing the
country for European Union membership, function better.
	   Solidarity's junior partner in the governing coalition, the
liberal Freedom Union, insisted the chairman of the committee be
sacked after the EU cut aid to Poland by about 20 percent in May.
	   Since then, the committee has been beset by internal conflicts,
with its chief officials publicly insulting each other.
	   Buzek said he had not taken the chairman's job himself right
after the government was formed, as was the case under the previous
Cabinet, because he was too busy with other important reforms.
	   Poland is eager to get started this year on in-depth talks with
the EU on several issues, including foreign policy, industrial
policy, telecommunications, culture and education.
	   But the EU first wants to review Poland's laws and regulations,
a process scheduled to last into mid-1999.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Ballot counting from parliamentary
elections progressed slowly Monday as Cambodians waited to see
whether the outcome would be a new government that would bring
peace and stability or still more turmoil to their tragedy-stricken
nation.
	   None of the three main parties seemed likely to win an outright
majority of the 122 seats in the National Assembly, making some
kind of coalition likely between strongman Hun Sen and his two main
challengers, Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy.
	   The National Election Committee estimated turnout Sunday was at
least 90 percent of the 5.4 million registered voters. First
partial results were scheduled to be announced Monday night.
	   International election monitors said it was too early to predict
an outcome, but Glenys Kinnock, special representative of the
European Union, the largest foreign election donor, urged the three
top candidates to accept the results and negotiate a peaceful
future for the country.
	   ``Hopefully, whatever happens, they'll work together on
reconciliation,'' Kinnock said as she toured Phnom Penh's largest
counting station, a sweltering school building packed with counting
officials, party workers and observers. Overall, observers said,
initial counting was going smoothly without major problems.
	   In the northern jungles around Anlong Veng, a former stronghold
of the Khmer Rouge, Gen. Chea Mann, the regional military
commander, said the situation was calm after hard-line Khmer Rouge
rebels attacked a military position Sunday, leaving 10 people dead.
	   There were no plans to increase security, given the large number
of government troops already in the area, Chea Mann said. Ballots
were being brought in from around the area to Anlong Veng for
counting.
	   The elections made history when thousands of Khmer Rouge from
Anlong Veng and elsewhere who have made peace in recent years voted
for the first time in their lives. The few hundred hard-liners
still fighting, however, vowed to disrupt the process.
	   When the ultraradical revolutionaries ruled Cambodia between
1975 and 1979, causing the death of as many as 2 million people,
advocating voting would have meant death.
	   The attack had little impact on the rest of the country.
Cambodia was far more troubled in the pre-election period by
violence, including murder, and intimidation blamed on Hun Sen to
ensure victory for his Cambodian People's Party.
	   Sam Rainsy, whose party bore the brunt of the violence, claimed
that partial results obtained by his workers at counting stations
Monday indicated a crushing defeat for Hun Sen's CPP. He predicted
a major shakeup in the political landscape.
	   ``I cannot say who has won, but who has lost _ the CPP,'' Sam
Rainsy said.
	   Fears persisted that trouble may lie ahead after results become
known and the political leaders, who harbor grudges against each
other, maneuver for position. An arrangement without Hun Sen is
hard to imagine, since he controls the security forces.
	   Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC won U.N.-sponsored elections backed by
20,000 peacekeepers in 1993. But Hun Sen, who came to power in 1985
under the Vietnamese military occupation that followed the Khmer
Rouge, forced his way into a co-premiership by threatening civil
war.
	   A year ago, Hun Sen ordered tanks into Phnom Penh and deposed
Ranariddh in two days of fighting. He allowed Ranariddh to return
from nine months of exile to contest the new elections in a bid to
win back international legitimacy and aid.
	   Thun Saray, president of the Committee for Free Elections in
Cambodia, told a news conference that ``if the ruling party gets
one-third, I worry perhaps we will have some problems.''

Albright denounces government of Myanmar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Albright declaring Myanmar responsible for Aung
San Suu Kyi's welfare. &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM RAUM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on Monday denounced the military-ruled government of
Myanmar and said the United States would hold it ``directly
responsible'' for the health and welfare of Nobel laureate Aung San
Suu Kyi.
	   ``I just wanted to make quite clear how we deplore the
government of Burma's refusal to allow members of the National
League for Democracy, a legal political party, to travel freely,''
Albright told a news conference.
	   It was the sharpest condemnation yet by the United States of the
government of Mynamar, formerly known as Burma.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, heads
Myanmar's pro-democracy party, the National League for Democracy.
She was stopped by police on Friday while driving to meet with NLD
members and, as Albright spoke, was preparing to spend her third
night in her car.
	   Albright called the news conference after a representative from
Myanmar defended his nation's conduct at a forum here of the
nine-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations and its Pacific
Rim neighbors.
	   ``The Burmese representative here has just ... responded to the
allegations, and I think his response is quite typical of an
authoritarian government that just doesn't get it, that blames the
victim for the problem,'' Albright said.
	   The ASEAN sessions have been private.
	   Speaking to the conference earlier, Albright said that
conditions in Myanmar have worsened during the past year, despite
progress on political reforms in other parts of Asia.
	   ``With each passing day,'' she said, ``the likelihood of social
breakdown _ or explosion _ that would undermine regional stability
grows higher.''
	   Albright's devoted much of her speech at a meeting of the ASEAN
Regional Forum to criticizing Myanmar's government. The forum,
which includes the United States and other major powers in Asia and
the West, focuses on security issues.
	   Myanmar's Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw also attended the forum.
Myanmar joined ASEAN last year after supporters argued that its
inclusion would encourage economic and political reform.
	   Albright spoke as Suu Kyi's highway standoff in Myanmar
continued. Suu Kyi was stopped Friday morning 32 miles (51
kilometers) west of the capital while driving to Bassein, 100 miles
(161 kilometers) west of Yangon, to meet members of her political
party.
	   ``We believe that freedom of movement is fundamental, and that
it's denial can only increase the already dangerous state of
tension in Burma. We are gravely concerned about the health and
safety of Aung San Suu Kyi and will hold the Burmese authorities
directly responsible for insuring her health and welfare,''
Albright said.
	   Albright told reporters she doubted that she could persuade the
ASEAN ministers to issue a statement condemning Myanmar because to
do so would require consensus, meaning approval from Myanmar
itself.
	   A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
quoted Philippines Secretary of Foreign Affairs Domingo Siazon as
saying that some of Myanmar's fellow ASEAN members were
disappointed by the lack of progress there and that Ohn Gyaw had
endured some ``tough discussions.''
	   However, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, one of the main
supporters of Myanmar's membership, denied Sunday that Myanmar had
been strongly criticized in any group meetings.
	   Myanmar's junta rose to power after crushing pro-democracy
demonstrations in 1988. It recently has clamped down on opponents
since Suu Kyi set an Aug. 21 deadline for the government to allow
the national assembly, elected in 1990, to convene. Suu Kyi's
National League for Democracy swept the election, but the military
refused to recognize the results.

Nepal, Bhutan, to debate fate of 90,000 refugees
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Leaders of Nepal and Bhutan will meet
this week to try to decide the fate of some 90,000 Nepalese
refugees who have been stranded in leech-infested camps for the
past nine years, diplomats said Monday.
	   Nepal's Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala plans to raise the
issue, which has strained relations between the neighboring
Himalayan countries, at a side meeting during the summit of South
Asian leaders that begins in Colombo on Wednesday.
	   ``We have told the Bhutanese that there is no more time to waste
and that the issues should be resolved by talks as soon as
possible,'' a Nepalese diplomat said on condition of anonymity.
	   The ethnic Nepalese refugees are mostly Hindu and wear different
clothes and speak a different language from the Buddhist Drukpa
majority of Bhutan. When Bhutan tried to force them to adopt
Bhatanese ways, the minorities resisted and were forced to return
to Nepal.
	   Nepal, one of the world's poorest countries, wants the refugees
to leave. Bhutan calls them agitators who want to overthrow the
monarchy and doesn't want them back.
	   The refugees have been stranded in eight U.N.-administered camps
eastern Nepal's Jhapa region. They live in tents and huts that are
infested with poisonous snakes and leeches during the monsoon
season.
	   Koirala will meet with Jigmi Thinley, the de facto head of
Bhutan's government since that country's National Assembly endorsed
a royal edict transferring executive powers from the king to the
Cabinet.
	   Nepalese diplomats hope that the political changes inside Bhutan
will lead the administration there to consider the refugees as
naturalized Bhutanese citizens.
	   In 1988, Bhutan began a ``one nation, one people'' campaign,
decreeing that anyone who could not trace their residency back to
1958 was no longer a citizen.
	   All citizens were required to learn the Bhutanese language,
Dzongkha, and were urged to adopt Buddhism.
	   The ethnic Nepalese, feeling their culture threatened, rose up
and tried to topple the king and replace him with a democratic
government. The Bhutanese began evicting them in large numbers in
1990.

Obuchi reportedly wants ex-premier Miyazawa for finance minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout to UPDATE with party leader saying LDP will

 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The man expected to become Japan's next prime
minister focused Monday on his choice for finance chief, a key
appointment in his effort to turn around the country's sagging
economy.
	   Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, elected last week as president of
the ruling party and thus nearly certain to be voted premier by
Parliament, was reportedly leaning toward former Prime Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa, a ruling party elder and economic specialist.
	   Obuchi was expected to ask Miyazawa to take the key post in a
new Cabinet expected to be announced later this week, the national
newspaper Yomiuri reported Monday.
	   Miyazawa's participation was seen as necessary to help Japan
overcome an ``unprecedented'' economic crisis, said the paper. The
report cited unidentified top officials in the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party.
	   Miyazawa is widely respected as an internationalist and an
expert on financial affairs. Obuchi may also ask Miyazawa to serve
as deputy prime minister, the Yomiuri said.
	   The task of Japanese finance minister is not enviable. The
country is grappling with its worst recession in decades,
record-high unemployment and bankruptcies, and a financial system
weighed down by mountains of bad debt.
	   ``It's not a very desirable position at present,'' Andrew
Shipley, chief economist at Schroders Securities (Japan), told Dow
Jones Newswires. ``The finance minister will preside over the
demise of the Japanese banking industry.''
	   Before serving as prime minister from 1991-1993, Miyazawa held
various senior Cabinet positions, including foreign minister and
finance minister. Before entering politics, he worked as a
bureaucrat in the Finance Ministry.
	   Obuchi is expected to be formally voted into office as prime
minister Thursday.
	   He will succeed fellow LDP member Ryutaro Hashimoto, who
announced his resignation after the party suffered a humiliating
defeat in July 12 elections for the upper house of Parliament. Many
voters were angered by the way the government has managed the
economy.
	   Yoshiro Mori, who was named over the weekend to the party's No.
2 post, secretary-general, said Monday the LDP was open to
opposition parties' policy proposals, including ideas for reforming
the country's financial system.
	   ``Regardless of whether the LDP has an absolute majority or not
(in Parliament's lower house), it's natural to listen to others'
opinions,'' Mori said.
	   The ruling party has a majority in the more powerful lower
house, though not in the upper house, where it will have to work
with opposition forces to get bills approved.
	   It wasn't clear Monday how far opposition forces would go in
cooperating with the LDP. The head of Japan's largest opposition
party said he will seek the dissolution of Parliament and general
elections as soon as possible.
	   Naoto Kan, leader of the Democratic Party of Japan, criticized
the LDP for choosing Obuchi, who had been the least popular of
three candidates in public opinion polls.
	   The selection of Obuchi means ``nothing has changed,'' Kan said.
``Any reform from an Obuchi administration will be halfhearted.''
	   But Kan added that his party ``is willing to talk with the LDP
about financial system reform bills.''

	   SANTIAGO, Cuba (AP) _ Fidel Castro alternately praised and
ridiculed the U.S. news media on the 45th anniversary of his
revolution, applauding one report that supported his convictions
about militant Cuban exiles while joking about another that put him
at death's door.
	   Standing before the army barracks that he attacked 45 years ago
to launch his revolt against dictator Fulgencio Batista, Castro
told 10,000 of Cuba's communist faithful that the revolution
remains intact despite economic hardship.
	   ``Don't ever be fooled. This is our hope ... that this
revolution never falls back. And that no one can ever destroy all
the dignity and glory that we have acquired,'' Castro said early
Monday as he drew to the end of a five-hour speech that began
Sunday evening.
	   Castro's voice broke frequently as he started out, but grew
stronger and clearer as the speech wore on.
	   Dressed in his trademark olive military fatigues but without his
billed cap, Castro spent most of his time discussing a series of
stories published this month in The New York Times quoting Cuban
exile Luis Posada Carriles, who once had ties to the Central
Intelligence Agency.
	   The Times quoted Posada as saying that his efforts to
destabilize Castro's government through last year's bombings at
luxury hotels on the island were financed by the Miami-based Cuban
American National Foundation.
	   ``When that article came out, the earth trembled in Miami,''
Castro said.
	   Posada later denied the newspaper reports in a television
interview, saying he had never received money from foundation
leaders. Jorge Mas Santos, the son of the foundation's late leader
Jorge Mas Canosa, also denied the reports.
	   Castro presented the series as proof of decades of U.S.-based
attempts to bring down his government, which he blamed both on the
CIA and on the Cuban American National Foundation. He said
assassination plots increase whenever he travels abroad.
	   ``Not even in the savannas of Africa are more hunts organized
than when I take a trip,'' Castro joked, drawing wild laughter from
the crowd. ``I'll be in Jamaica on the 29th. I'm giving advance
notice to all those organizations of assassins.''
	   Castro, 71, ridiculed a report in another U.S. newspaper that
said he was critically sick last year.
	   Although he did not refer to the newspaper by name, he was
clearly referring to El Nuevo Herald of Miami. The paper reported
July 19 that a former surgeon at a Havana hospital said Castro was
hospitalized from Oct. 22-28 for treatment of hypertensive
encephalopathy, a brain disease.
	   ``I almost have fun with all this news,'' Castro said. ``Every
once in a while they kill me off. The day I die, no one will
believe it.''
	   Castro has said he had never heard of the disease or the woman
cited in the report, Elizabeth Trujillo. The El Nuevo Herald has
stood behind its report.
	   Castro also criticized the U.S. government for what he called
its inability to prevent terrorism within its own borders and for a
culture of violence that he also blamed on Hollywood.
	   Cuba itself has been passing through tough times since most of
its foreign aid disappeared along with the Soviet Union. The U.S.
economic embargo also continues to take a heavy toll.
	   Castro said his government has learned from four decades in
power, and will be making changes that will give people a better
standard of living.
	   He listed the accomplishments his socialist revolution already
has produced: free education and health care, one of the best
literacy rates in the world, access to utilities and housing for an
overwhelming majority of the island's 11 million people.
	   ``We now have to perfect (the revolution), to become stronger,
more cultured, more prepared,'' Castro said. ``We will continue to
fight. We have reason to be very proud.''
	   Many in the audience agreed, and called for Cubans to rally
around Castro's government in times of need.
	   ``In difficult moments, the people unite to support the
revolution,'' said Manuel Valdez, 63, a retired soldier.
	   Added Romarico Dunan, a farmers' leader from the nearby village
of Guama: ``The embargo makes life more difficult. But here we are,
strengthened by our knowledge that the path we have chosen is the
right one.''

Arsonists attack Italian embassy cars, FIAT dealerships

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Arsonists early Monday burned two cars
belonging to Italian embassy officials and six cars parked at two
FIAT automobile dealerships. Bomb disposal experts also detonated a
suspicious package placed outside a Ferrari dealer. No one was
injured in any of the attacks.
	   Police said the Italian embassy cars, parked in central Athens,
were doused in gasoline at 1:25 a.m. (1025 GMT) and set ablaze.
They believe the FIAT cars, parked outside the dealerships on the
outskirts of central Athens, were destroyed by propane cooking gas
canisters soaked in gasoline. Three cars were destroyed outside
each dealership.
	   The attacks against the embassy cars and dealerships all
occurred within 30 minutes of each other. A few hours later, police
used a robot to detonate a package outside a Ferrari dealership,
also on the outskirts of the city center, but discovered it was
filled with pebbles.
	   The attack was claimed in a telephone call to a local television
station by a little-know group called ``Arsonists for Social
Cohesion.'' A number of similar, small and prolific terrorist
groups have this year carried out more than 150 firebombings,
mostly against cars belonging to government officials, diplomats,
journalists and foreign companies. The attacks resulted in only one
injury.
	   Most of the attacks have been carried out using propane tanks
soaked in gasoline.
	   Officials have been unable to stop the attacks, which have
increased fears of harm to Greece's vital tourism industry.

France names Lemerre as successor to World Cup winner Jacquet

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Roger Lemerre was named France's new national
soccer coach on Monday, edging out Jean Tigana to the No. 1 job in
French soccer.
	   Lemerre takes over from Aime Jacquet, who left the post after
guiding France to the World Cup title on July 12.
	   Lemerre has been given a two-year contract that takes him into
the European championships in the year 2000, Claude Simonet,
president of the French Football Federation, said at a news
conference.
	   Lemerre, 57, became Jacquet's assistant in January, but has
limited experience of top-level management.
	   Before joining Jacquet, Lemerre was responsible for the French
Army soccer team.
	   The French Football Federation said Lemerre was chosen to
maintain continuity. Tigana, Monaco's coach, was considered the
other main candidate for the position.

Traces of cyanide that killed four found in pot of curry

leader in 11th graf; ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Police investigating four cyanide poisoning deaths
in western Japan said Monday they believe the deadly chemical had
been mixed into a pot of curry at a weekend festival.
	   There are still no suspects in the deaths, said police spokesman
Shuji Imoto.
	   The four died and 60 were sickened after eating dishes of curry
served over rice at the local festival Saturday in Wakayama, a
small coastal city 453 kilometers (283 miles) southwest of Tokyo.
	   Police found traces of cyanide in leftover dishes, in the pot
itself and in the vomit of some of those who fell ill.
	   Those who died included a 10-year-old elementary school boy, a
16-year-old high school girl and the chairman and vice chairman of
the community group that put on the festival.
	   About 150 investigators were questioning local residents Monday
and searching the area for traces of the poison, Wakayama police
spokesman Imoto said.
	   The National Police Agency in Tokyo said Monday it sent two
specialists to assist in the investigation.
	   Police suspected the poison had been mixed into one of three
pots of curry prepared that morning at a local resident's garage by
a group of housewives, police said.
	   They were investigating whether someone slipped in the cyanide
when no one was looking.
	   Residents told police no strangers had been spotted in the area
before or during the festival, press reports said.
	   ``When this kind of an incident happens in a local setting it
can create mutual suspicion among residents,'' neighborhood
association head Fumio Nakanishi was quoted as saying by the
newspaper Tokyo Shimbun.
	   A local man told national broadcaster NHK that someone had
tasted the curry before it was taken to the festival site and
detected nothing unusual.
	   About 100 people attended the annual festival in a vacant
neighborhood lot. The curry was ladled on to disposable plates.
	   Shortly after the meals were distributed Saturday evening at
about 6 p.m., those who had eaten them became violently ill. Many
collapsed and began vomiting.
	   Among those who fell ill, 39 remained hospitalized.
	   Newspapers reported that the local community was in a state of
shock, with several businesses closed Monday.
	   The reports said other neighborhoods in the city were
considering canceling similar festivals for fear of copycat crimes.
	   The festivals are common in Japan during the summer and are
often held on the grounds of local Shinto and Buddhist temples.
	   The poisonings prompted Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto on
Monday to urge strict new controls for cyanide, Kyodo News service
reported.
	   ``We have to prevent wide circulation,'' Hashimoto was quoted as
saying.

Castro says top economic planner could have died in downed jet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Cuba-Castro &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Cuba (AP) _ Fidel Castro says Vice President Carlos
Lage, his top economic planner, was scheduled to be on the Cuban
airliner that was bombed near Barbados 22 years ago Monday, but
changed plans at the last minute.
	   Seventy-three people were killed aboard the Cubana Aviacion
flight carrying Cubans, North Koreans and Guyanese when it was
blown up in a terrorist attack on July 28, 1976.
	   ``Look at how the revolution nearly lost an excellent leader
because of the adventures we are now narrating,'' Castro said late
Sunday during a five-hour Revolution Day speech that recounted the
terrorist attacks against the communist island over three decades.
	   ``Lage was destined to die on that plane,'' Castro said. ``He
was in Panama and he had the possibility to return to Cuba through
Barbados or through Mexico,'' and opted for the latter.
	   Lage, one of the top leaders in the communist government, is
considered the architect of the modest economic reforms instituted
since the collapse of the Soviet bloc plunged Cuba into a severe
crisis at the beginning of this decade.
	   He holds a number of important posts, including secretary of the
Executive Committee of the Council of Ministers, and is considered
among the top three or four leaders in Cuba.
	   Castro made his revelation during his lengthy description of a
series published this month in The New York Times.
	   The series extensively quoted Cuban exile Luis Posada Carriles,
who admitted to a violent campaign aimed at toppling Castro's
government, including a series of hotel bombings that killed an
Italian tourist last year.
	   Posada was accused twice in the bombing of the jetliner, but was
never brought to trial.
	   He escaped from a Venezuelan prison in 1985 and later turned up
in Central America, where he reportedly served as military adviser
to the U.S.-backed Contras in Nicaragua and to the right-wing
government in El Salvador.

German court drops criminal charges against former GM exec Lopez
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DARMSTADT, Germany (AP) _ A former top General Motors executive
in Europe who was involved one of the auto industry's biggest
industrial espionage cases was ordered Monday to pay 400,000 marks
(dlrs 225,000) to charity in exchange for the dropping of criminal
charges against him.
	   The state court in Darmstadt, just south of Frankfurt, also
levied smaller fines against three of Jose Ignacio Lopez's former
GM colleagues to settle the case.
	   The four managers were accused of taking important GM research,
planning and sales documents with them when they suddenly jumped
ship to Volkswagen in 1993.
	   VW agreed in January 1997 to pay GM dlrs 100 million and buy
dlrs 1 billion worth of GM parts to settle a civil suit.
	   But criminal charges of betraying ``trade and company secrets''
brought in 1996 were still pending in Germany.
	   Proceedings were delayed by Lopez' poor health. Lopez, who
resigned from VW in November 1996, was injured in a car accident in
January.
	   Court spokeswoman Christa Pfannenschmidt said the court agreed
to settle the case because it would have taken at least two years
to try.
	   Legal questions such as whether a foreign-based firm like GM
could apply German laws against unfair competition, and how to
define a business secret in the auto industry complicated the
matter, she said.
	   The court also took note of the settlement of the civil lawsuit,
she said, and the decision by Opel, GM's German subsidiary, to
withdraw from the criminal case as co-plaintiff.
	   Lopez, the star manager who was about to be promoted to chief of
GM's huge North American operations when he defected to VW, must
pay 400,000 marks (dlrs 225,000), she said.
	   Jose Manuel Gutierrez was fined 100,000 marks (dlrs 56,250),
Jorge Alvarez 50,000 marks (dlrs 28,125) and Rosario Piazza 40,000
marks (dlrs 20,625).
	   The case will be officially closed as soon as the fines are
paid, she said.

India, Pakistan nuclear tests, economic crises raised at ASEAN
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in top 6 grafs with mild text of statement on
Pakistan-India tests &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos ASEAN101-112 &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURINDA KEYS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Asian and Western nations urged India
and Pakistan on Monday to halt their nuclear weapons programs,
saying they heightened tension in a region already threatened by
instability from an economic breakdown.
	   Ministers from 19 countries plus the European Union were behind
a relatively mild statement that ``strongly deplored'' the recent
tests, according to a draft communique obtained by The Associated
Press. India and Pakistan were not named in the draft copy, which
called for them to cease nuclear tests and sign international
treaties against further proliferation.
	   India, the 21st member of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations Regional Forum, had held out against the criticism, arguing
that it had good reasons to conduct the May 11 and 13 tests
``because the non-proliferation regime had turned flawed and
discriminatory.''
	   The draft statement, which took a day and a half of meetings to
produce, also called on long-term nuclear weapons states ``to make
further efforts toward achieving the objective of eliminating
nuclear weapons.''
	   ``There is only one country putting up any defense of India, and
that is India,'' said Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer.
Pakistan is not a member of the annual forum, held to discuss and
defuse issues that could lead to instability in Southeast Asia.
	   The nuclear tension, combined with financial near-collapse or
recession in several East Asian countries, indicates ``we are
meeting at a time characterized more by doubt than by triumph,''
said U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
	   And Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan described the tests as
``plunging South Asia into a sudden wave of tension.''
	   Tang warned that as East Asia's financial crisis continues, new
problems could emerge to threaten regional stability.
	   ``Economic security has increasingly become an inseparable part
of national and regional security,'' he said. The crisis ``broke
out ferociously ... no less than that of a war.''
	   For China, he said, economic security meant safeguarding the
economic sovereignty of the state. He cautioned against excessive
currency speculation.
	   The devaluation of the Thai baht in July 1997 unleashed
speculative attacks against currencies in the region and started
East Asia's now year-old financial crisis.
	   Albright and Japan's prime minister-in-waiting Keizo Obuchi,
representing the world's two largest economies, met on the
sidelines of the forum and pledged major efforts to lift Asia out
of its financial doldrums.
	   Obuchi said his top priorities _ once he is formally promoted
from foreign minister to prime minister later this week _ are
ending Japan's own recession and ``making a contribution to Asia.''
	   He told Albright he would overcome his reputation for
indecisiveness by following through on a campaign pledge to enact a
package of a dlrs 43 billion tax cut and dlrs 71 billion in
government spending, U.S. officials said.
	   Albright said the United States has ``a vital security interest
in speeding Asia's recovery.'' But even with assistance from the
United States and international lending institutions, the road to
recovery is a tough one.
	   ``There is no question the region will recover. ... The real
question is whether it will emerge stronger, more open, more
democratic, better equipped to meet new challenges,'' she said.

Chinese gymnast unlikely to walk again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EAST MEADOW, New York (AP) _ For an athlete who spent her
childhood perfecting vaults, flips and twirling dismounts, a
mundane feat like sitting up in bed shouldn't be a big deal.
	   But that simple act became a major event Sunday for Chinese
gymnast Sang Lan, paralyzed since she fell on her head last week
during practice for the Goodwill Games.
	   Sang's modest progress followed a seven-hour operation Saturday
to stabilize her neck. Although her doctors called the procedure a
success, they still said it's unlikely the 17-year-old will walk
again.
	   ``There are just so many different nerve connections that have
to heal,'' Dr. Vincent Leone told a news conference at the Nassau
County Medical Center in Long Island.
	   Since the surgery, Sang has gained strength in her shoulders and
biceps, but there has been no improvement in mobility in her hands,
wrists and legs, said Leone, the hospital's director of spinal
surgery.
	   She was able to sit up in bed because the operation provided her
neck the proper support and alignment, not because she gained the
strength to prop herself up, the doctor said.
	   Given the complexity of the injury and the healing process, it
was too soon to say how quickly the gymnast would recover and what
her final prognosis will be, Leone said.
	   Using a yellow rubber model of the spine, Leone explained the
goal of Saturday's surgery was to stabilize Sang's spine by
screwing three titanium plates into the section of the neck injured
in the fall.
	   ``The implants basically prevent her head from falling off her
shoulders,'' Leone said.
	   Surgeons also removed broken bone fragments and used bits of
bone from her left hip to fuse vertebrae.
	   Sang also is being treated with an experimental nerve drug that
doctors said was her only hope of walking again. But Leone said it
was too early to say if the drug, which provides the building
blocks for nerves to repair themselves, was working.
	   Sang, the 1997 Chinese national vault champion, was chosen for
national team training when she was 11. Since then, her parents had
seen her only three times in China, most recently in October, as
their only daughter trained 740 miles (1190 kilometers) from home
in Beijing.
	   Hours after her operation, Sang's parents arrived in New York
and were driven from Kennedy Airport to the hospital. The couple,
who did not speak to reporters, plan to give a news conference in
the next several days, hospital spokeswoman Shelley Lotenberg said.
	   Sang will have to stay at the hospital for at least a week under
observation, and her parents have not decided whether to continue
treatment for their only child here or move her back home.
	   Before her parents left China, Sang's saddened friends made
1,000 paper birds for the couple to take with them _ symbols of
their wishes for a quick recovery.
	   Sunday night, after the gymnastics competition closed with an
exhibition performance, the Chinese team joined Sang's parents in
her hospital room.
	   Sang had asked to watch the event on television, but officials
were unable to run the proper cables into her intensive-care unit
room, Goodwill Games spokeswoman Jan Fanbro said.
	   Goodwill Games spokesman Michael Lewellen reiterated an earlier
pledge by the event's sponsor, Turner Sports, and its parent
company, Time-Warner Inc., to provide all possible resources to
secure the family's future.
	   Lewellen said details had yet to be finalized.
	   ``The family has only been here for a few hours,'' he said.
``They haven't had the opportunity to state their wishes.''

Hong Kong share prices tumble

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices tumbled in Hong Kong Monday
because of uncertainty over whether Japan's new leader would be
able to boost that country's economy.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
fell 273.03 points, or 3.3 percent, closing at 7,984.43. It was the
first time in six weeks that the index had closed below 8,000
points.
	   Turnover amounted to 3.63 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
464 million), down from Friday's 4.31 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 552 million).
	   Brokers said investors worried over whether Foreign Minister
Keizo Obuchi, who was elected Friday to head Japan's ruling Liberal
Democratic Party, would be able reverse the country's faltering
economy.
	   Obuchi is virtually certain to become Japan's prime minister,
replacing Ryutaro Hashimoto, who resigned early this month after
the party suffered a major setback in parliamentary elections.
	   Brokers said trading was thin because many investors were
awaiting developments in Japan.
	   Among properties, Cheung Kong fell 1.10 Hong Kong dollars to
34.50, and Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 90 cents to 30.00.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings fell 7.00 dollars to

	   Elsewhere, Swire Pacific ``A'' fell 1.20 dollars to 26.80, and
Hong Kong Telecom fell 40 cents to 14.25.

Chinese mull blowing dikes to save cities
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WUHAN, China (AP) _ With waters in the rain-swollen Yangtze
River dangerously high and still rising, China is considering
blowing up dikes and diverting flood waters into farm districts to
save cities from flooding, official media said Monday.
	   As the third flood crest this month roared toward hard-pressed
central China, authorities warned that levees weakened by weeks of
rain and high water could collapse under the sustained pressure,
the China Daily said.
	   The situation in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze is
entering ``the most critical stage,'' the newspaper quoted regional
flood relief official Li Antian saying.
	   To release pressure on the dikes, authorities may have to blast
open upstream levees, inundating crop land and forcing tens of
thousands of farmers to evacuate, the newspaper said.
	   It didn't say when or where levees might be blown, but such
tactics underscore authorities' desperation in dealing with the
highest Yangtze water levels in 44 years. Some of China's most
populous farm areas and important industrial centers are now at
risk, including Wuhan city, with more than 7 million residents.
	   Flooding so far has killed more than 1,145 people since rains
began falling heavier than usual in the spring. Almost a million
people have been forced from their homes in the three worst-hit
provinces _ Hunan, Hubei and Jiangxi.
	   The State Council, China's Cabinet, issued a directive Monday
ordering flood relief agencies to coordinate operations and ``spare
no effort'' to help those affected.
	   Disaster relief material, including 400 rubber rafts, 800,000
sandbags and 240,000 square meters (2.6 million square feet) of
sheeting, has been sent to Hunan already, the Xinhua News Agency
reported.
	   Rains have pushed 3,600 kilometers (2,100 miles) of mud and
stone dikes to the breaking point in the Yangtze basin, the
newspaper said. Inspectors have found 1,000 weak points along
levees in Hubei, and sandbags have been stacked over a meter (yard)
high along a 240-kilometer (140-mile) section.
	   Dikes have already been breached in several places along the
Dongting lakes in Hunan, which connect to the Yangtze. Downstream
on Saicheng Lake near Jiujiang, Jiangxi province, 100 meters
(yards) of dikes have crumbled and more may go despite repair work
by thousands of citizens and paramilitary troops, Xinhua said.
	   The river at Jiujiang is expected to reach the top of levees in
two or three days. Farther downstream, Jiangsu province has begun
evacuating people living on islands in the Yangtze in anticipation
of the flood crest.
	   Flooding has been blamed for 22 deaths around Jiujiang. Another
person was killed and a dozen were injured by a tornado that roared
through farm country south of the city on Sunday, Xinhua said.

Iraq accuses Washington, opposition, of Baghdad bomb
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq on Monday accused the United States
and American-backed Iraqi opponents of being behind an explosion in
Baghdad last week.
	   A car exploded in the parking lot of Baghdad's Al-Rasheed Hotel
on Friday, causing minor damage and no injuries.
	   There has been no claim of responsibility.
	   Al-Thawra, which is published by the ruling Baath party, charged
in an editorial on Monday that the United States was behind the
blast.
	   It cited recent reports from Washington that the Clinton
administration has asked the U.S. Congress to fund covert
operations against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
	   ``Reports say that the American administration has paid money
for the so-called opposition to carry out political, media and
secret operations against Iraq and its people,'' said newspaper
said.
	   It added that the explosion at the Al-Rasheed ``is one of the
activities which those agents were to carry out.''
	   It did not cite any evidence for the allegation.
	   Al-Thawra said it expected further violence by Iraqi opponents
of the regime, saying: ``We expect the explosion to be the
beginning of other terrorist acts in order to utilize the payment
from their American and Zionist masters.''
	   The paper said the Clinton administration was resorting to plots
against the Iraqi regime ``to cover their failure'' to bring Iraq
to its knees with sanctions.
	   It was a reference to stringent U.N. trade sanctions imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The United States and Britain have led the fight in the U.N.
Security Council to keep the sanctions in place until Iraq has
eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The paper said that now that there is rising support in the
United Nations for lifting the sanctions, the Americans were
adopting ``this dirty, cowardly way'' to punish Iraq.

Opposition supporters defy police order, stage rally in Indonesia

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police peacefully dispersed more than
1,000 supporters of opposition figure Megawati Sukarnoputri after
they staged an illegal street protest Monday to commemorate a
bloody crackdown against their political party in 1996.
	   Troops and riot police surrounded the office of the Indonesian
Democratic Party, or PDI, the site of a violent clash between
Megawati supporters and troops two years ago. Security forces also
blocked off several streets.
	   There were no reports of arrests at Monday's standoff, which
ended after about four hours.
	   Many in the crowd shouted ``Long live Megawati'' and chanted
anti-government slogans before police opened a major road in front
of the office and persuaded the protesters to leave.
	   Earlier, about 10,000 Megawati supporters, most wearing the
party's red and black colors, staged a peaceful rally around her
house in one of the biggest political events since the resignation
of former President Suharto in May.
	   It went ahead in suburban south Jakarta after police banned
plans to stage it in the center of the capital, citing security
concerns.
	   The military said it had put about 9,000 troops and police on
alert in case of trouble.
	   Hundreds of Megawati supporters later drove in a convoy to the
PDI headquarters, where they were met by security forces.
	   Hours earlier, about 200 people laid flowers outside the
building.
	   On Sunday, hundreds of Megawati supporters clashed with members
of a rival political party after a similar commemoration in
Yogyakarta, 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   The opposing mobs tried to set fire to the offices of each
other's party before police intervened.
	   In a sometimes fiery speech to Monday's crowd, which spilled
over into surrounding streets and a nearby field, Megawati
criticized the ban on a central Jakarta rally as ``legal
harassment.''
	   The ousted PDI head said the government of President B.J.
Habibie was only paying lip service to promises of political reform
and free speech.
	   ``The ban raises the question of the government's commitment to
total reform,'' she said.
	   With her eye on elections promised for next year, Megawati urged
her supporters to remain non-violent and to obey the law as part of
her campaign for ``truth and justice.''
	   In the city of Solo, about 500 kilometers (310 miles) east of
Jakarta, more than 7,000 Megawati supporters staged a peaceful
street march Monday.
	   Two years ago, Megawati, the eldest daughter of Indonesia's
founding President Sukarno, gained wide popularity after she
criticized the autocratic policies of Suharto.
	   That led, however, to her ouster as PDI head in June 1996 by
pro-government rivals within the party.
	   Her supporters protested by occupying the party's Jakarta
headquarters. But on July 27, the military and police staged a
predawn raid on the building.
	   The assault triggered major riots. At least five people were
killed and dozens of others were reported missing.
	   The political fortunes of Megawati and other opposition figures
have risen following the resignation of Suharto two months ago
after Indonesia was rocked by student protests and riots amid by
the worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Suharto's successor, Habibie, has promised to reform the tightly
controlled political system and to hold free elections next year.

Palestinians reject reported Israeli withdrawal proposals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is trying to bring the Palestinians back
to the negotiating table with proposals for joint security control
of a small area in the West Bank, Israeli media reports said
Monday.
	   But Palestinian officials said they would not consider any
proposals that were not in line with a U.S. initiative for an
Israeli withdrawal from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Israel has refused to accept the American initiative, and talks
on the long overdue troop withdrawal have been deadlocked for
months.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Mahmoud Abbas,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's top deputy, met secretly
Saturday night in an effort to restart the talks. A spokesman for
Mordechai said talks would resume soon, and Israeli media reports
said the Palestinians had agreed to rejoin the talks after hearing
concessions presented by Mordechai.
	   Israel seized the West Bank from neighboring Jordan in 1967.
	   Israel has balked at turning over more than 10 percent more of
the West Bank to the Palestinians before a final peace settlement
is reached. But the Maariv newspaper said Mordechai told Abbas that
Israel was willing to share security control with the Palestinians
in another 3 percent, and that the 3 percent would be on contiguous
land _ near Bethlehem in the Judean Desert.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, speaking Monday on Israel
Radio, said there had been no agreement on the 3 percent or any
other matter.
	   ``We are discussing various suggestions, but no agreements have
been reached,'' he said.
	   He said, however, that there had been a decision to restart the
talks.
	   Palestinian negotiators, however, said the talks would not
resume until the Israelis brought new ideas that did not contradict
the American proposal.
	   Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to Arafat, said Monday that the reported
3-percent proposals were not new and not in line with the U.S.
proposal.
	   ``If these are the ideas they bring to the Palestinian side,
then Netanyahu is sentencing the talks to failure,'' he told The
Associated Press.
	   Tibi said no new talks on the redeployment were scheduled,
although Abbas was to meet Monday night with Israeli police
minister Avigdor Kahalani to discuss other issues of
Israel-Palestinian relations.

 &UR; Daimler, Nissan to cooperate on building light trucks &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more details, changes dateline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ In another sign of consolidation in
the global auto industry, Daimler-Benz AG and Nissan Diesel Motor
Co. of Japan said Monday they would jointly build a light truck
starting in 2002 as a first step toward a broader alliance.
	   Nissan Motor, Japan's second-largest automaker, and Daimler,
Germany's largest industrial group, said in May they were in talks
on a possible alliance or joint venture.
	   Daimler, which has been looking to strengthen its global
position, is buying Chrysler to expand its presence in the U.S.
market, and has said it wants to double its market share in Asia
within the next 10 years to at least 20 percent.
	   ``This cooperation will be an important step to expanding our
truck business in Asia,'' Daimler chairman Juergen Schrempp said in
a statement. ``It will form an integral component of our Asia
strategy.''
	   A Nissan official said discussions were continuing about Daimler
possibly taking a major stake in Nissan Diesel, Nissan's truck and
bus making unit.
	   Nissan Diesel has been battered by slumping domestic consumption
and Asia's economic crisis. Nissan Motors reportedly wants to sell
most of its 39 percent share because of the heavy cost of keeping
the affiliate afloat.
	   At news conferences in Tokyo and Stuttgart, the companies said
the three-to-nine ton light trucks will be designed for emerging
markets where demand is growing rapidly.
	   The companies said they are aiming for annual sales of between
100,000 and 150,000 trucks a year by 2005.
	   The joint project, to be manufactured in existing plants, will
serve as a worldwide platform for a new generation of light trucks.
	   The companies will exchange components and combine their
respective development and production know-how. They also will
utilize the sales organizations of Nissan Motor, Nissan Diesel and
Daimler-Benz for the distribution of the new vehicle.

Opposition commander, 1,500 men defect to Taliban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ A Taliban religious army spokesman
said an opposition commander and his 1,500 fighters defected to the
Taliban side on Monday.
	   The move by Abdul Khair Hakimi, which could not be independently
confirmed, would put several villages in central Ghor Province
under Taliban control and could allow the religious militia to open
a new front against its enemies.
	   The Taliban spokesman said on customary condition of anonymity
that Hakimi had pledged to defend the Taliban administration.
	   There were also reports Monday of continued fierce fighting in
Faryab Province, north of Ghor. The Taliban army moved into Faryab
two weeks ago, handing troops led by former communist general
Rashid Dostum their most serious setback in the past year.
	   The Taliban religious army rules in about 85 percent of
Afghanistan and controls the capital, Kabul.
	   The anti-Taliban alliance that controls the remaining 15 per
cent of Afghanistan, mostly in the north, has been weakened by
infighting among its factions.

Estrada promises to end Marcos wealth case in one year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Philippines-Estrada &QL; 
 &UR; By CLARO CORTES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada promised
Monday to finish in one year what two previous presidents failed to
do in 12 years _ recover billions of dollars that the late dictator
Ferdinand Marcos allegedly stashed abroad.
	   Estrada said in his first state-of-the-nation address that the
government's recovery efforts ``have gone long enough'' to recover
the Marcos wealth.
	   ``No more delays,'' said Estrada. ``One way or another, I want
these cases to end in one year, in final judgments or acceptable
settlements. ... This is a clear example of justice delayed,
justice denied.''
	   The cash-strapped Estrada government had said earlier it was
inclined to favor an out-of-court settlement with the Marcos family
because years of legal battles to recover their alleged ill-gotten
wealth have yielded little.
	   Marcos was ousted in a ``people power'' revolt in 1986 and died
three years later in exile in Hawaii.
	   The two presidents who followed Marcos _ Corazon Aquino and
Fidel Ramos _ failed to make much headway on the recovery effort.
	   The government is seeking to recover dlrs 540 million in Swiss
bank deposits that it claims are part of the billions of dollars
Marcos allegedly embezzled during his 20-year rule.
	   The Swiss deposits have been transferred to an escrow account in
a Philippine bank. It will be released to the government if it wins
a conviction against Marcos' widow, Imelda, or if negotiates a
settlement with the Marcos family.
	   The Marcos family said it was willing to open a new round of
talks on sharing Marcos' Swiss bank deposits with the government.
	   Mrs. Marcos said she expects the talks to ``go fast'' under the
Estrada government, but she believes her family will be vindicated.
	   ``After 12 years, all of these cases will melt down to
nothing,'' she said.
	   Mrs. Marcos has been convicted of graft unrelated to the Swiss
accounts and sentenced to up to 12 years in prison. She is free on
bail pending her appeal to the Supreme Court.
	   The Presidential Commission on Good Government, which is in
charge of recovering the alleged ill-gotten wealth, negotiated a
75-25 division of the Marcos wealth in 1993 in favor of the
government.
	   In exchange, the Marcoses were to be granted immunity from
future suits. But the agreement fell through because the Marcoses
failed to provide a list of all their assets, according to the
government.
	   Human rights groups and the National Democratic Front, the
Communist umbrella organization that is negotiating peace with the
government, are opposed to granting Marcos' family and associates
immunity from legal action.
	   Part of the Marcos money is supposed to be given to 9,539 human
rights victims who won a class action suit in a Hawaii court
against Marcos' estate.

	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Vice Adm. Charles Moore, who commanded
the USS Independence aircraft carrier during recent tension with
Iraq, took over Monday as commander of the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet.
	   Moore, who is from Midland, Texas, replaced Vice Adm. Thomas
Fargo, who had held the post since July 1996.
	   The change-of-command ceremony was attended by Gen. Anthony
Zinni, commander of the U.S. Central Command.
	   Moore will be in charge of the Bahrain-based 5th Fleet, which
has been heavily involved in U.S. efforts to contain Iraq.
	   Earlier this year, U.S. warships _ including the Independence _
were involved in a show of force in the Gulf after Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein threatened to block U.N. weapons inspectors from
palace compounds. The impasse was resolved after intervention by
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   The U.N. inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction before the U.N. Security Council will
lift punishing trade sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.
	   Jets flown from 5th Fleet ships patrol the ``no-fly zone'' set
up over southern Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War to protect Shiite
Muslims from Saddam's forces.
	   The United States currently has more than 20 warships in the
Gulf, including the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln.
	   The 5th Fleet's region extends from Egypt to Pakistan and from
Kenya to the Gulf and includes part of the Indian Ocean.

German jailed in Iran to be freed soon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A German businessman jailed in Iran for
having a sexual relationship with a Muslim woman will be freed soon
because of his conversion to Islam and because he has agreed to
marry the woman, sources close to the case said Monday.
	   The businessman, Helmut Hofer, recently took the Muslim name
Reza, after a Shiite Muslim saint, said the sources, who spoke on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Hofer was sentenced to death in January soon after his arrest
for having sex with a 26-year-old medical student to whom he was
not married.
	   Iranian law punishes sex between unmarried Muslims with
flogging, but if the man is a non-Muslim he faces the death
penalty.
	   The Justice Ministry ordered a retrial after Hofer, 54, insisted
he had converted to Islam before having sex with the woman.
	   The sources said that an appeals court hearing the case had
rejected a bail request by Hofer on technical grounds.
	   But, they said, the court has reassured German officials that
Hofer would be freed soon because the court was satisfied he was a
Muslim and would marry the Iranian woman.
	   It was not clear whether Hofer still would be flogged.
	   Hofer's Iranian lawyer could not be reached for comment, and the
German Embassy in Tehran refused to speak to reporters about the
case.
	   Iran has been keen to improve its relations with the European
Union, especially its top Western trade partner, Germany.
	   While there is no evidence that the government had influenced
the decision to retry Hofer, political considerations generally are
taken into account by Iranian courts.

Report: Top judicial employee fired for child porn possession
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Dutch child pornography scandal
widened Monday with a report that a top Justice Ministry employee
was fired for downloading thousands of Internet images of children
being sexually abused.
	   The civil servant, whose name was not released, reportedly
collected and sold images _ including some of children as young as
age 1 being raped _ using computers at his home and office, the
daily De Telegraaf said. Two other Justice Ministry employees have
been suspended in connection with the case, it said.
	   The Justice Ministry did not immediately return calls seeking
confirmation of the report. But Liesbeth Horstink, spokeswoman for
the public prosecutor's office in The Hague, confirmed that an
investigation was under way.
	   ``We are investigating a man on suspicion of possession of child
pornography,'' she said. She declined to give further details.
Possession of child pornography carries a maximum sentence of six
years' imprisonment in the Netherlands.
	   The news added to a deepening scandal that has gripped the
Netherlands since police discovered a huge stash of child
pornography in an apartment in the seaside town of Zandvoort two
weeks ago.
	   The apartment is believed to have been the central point in a
worldwide ring of pedophiles who exchanged digital images of child
pornography via the Internet.
	   Police are investigating whether the fired civil servant, who
headed the Justice Ministry's information technology department,
had any links to the Zandvoort pedophile ring.
	   Auditors at the Justice Ministry discovered the child porn while
investigating the civil servant's unusually high telephone bills in
April. They hacked into his computer and discovered thousands of
digital photographs of children, De Telegraaf reported.
	   The man was immediately fired and details of the case were
passed to the public prosecutor in The Hague.

Philippine President Estrada announces austerity program
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Planned &QL; 
 &UR; By OLIVER TEVES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Painting a bleak picture of the
Philippine economy and the cash-strapped government that he
inherited, President Joseph Estrada unveiled an austerity and
revenue generation program in his first state-of-the-nation address
Monday.
	   ``I won't beat around the bush. We are facing a severe crisis
that is rocking the whole of Asia,'' Estrada said. ``The government
cannot shore up the weakness of the economy. In short, the
government is bankrupt.''
	   Sniping at claims by the administration of his predecessor,
Fidel Ramos, that the number of poor Filipinos has declined over
the last six years, Estrada said the statistics are meaningless to
ordinary people.
	   ``Poor is poor _ no money, no food, no roof over their heads, no
dignity and especially no hope,'' said Estrada.
	   Estrada, a former actor who portrayed underdog heroes
championing the poor, campaigned on a pro-poor platform in the May
11 election.
	   Estrada said that while the economy is slowing, commodity
prices, unemployment and the crime rate are rising.
	   Labor productivity is declining as more and more Filipinos are
unable to go to school because the government could not increase
spending for public education, he said.
	   Estrada said that after 26 years, only 57 percent of lands
targeted for distribution in a land reform program have been
distributed and agricultural productivity is also declining.
	   While the budget deficit is ballooning to an expected 70 billion
pesos (about dlrs 1.7 billion), corruption and foreign debt service
continue to drain the government's coffers.
	   Estrada said his administration will continue the economic and
political reforms of his predecessors.
	   ``But we race against time as an impatient public asks us: when
will those reforms pay dividends for the common man,'' he said.
``Well, we just have to begin now. With honesty, with thrift, with
efficiency.''
	   He said he has ordered the withholding of 25 percent of budget
allocations and 10 percent of allotments for local governments, and
urged Congress to abolish its pork barrel and postpone programs,
including military modernization, funded by the sale of military
camps this year.
	   To raise additional revenue, Estrada also asked Congress to pass
a law to privatize the state-run National Power Corp., the largest
Philippine company.
	   He said government shares will be sold in other major
corporations, such as the Philippine National Bank and Petron
Corp., the country's largest oil refiner.
	   To make more funds available for small and medium enterprises,
he said he will reverse the practice of government finance
corporations that allow large companies to corner loans from the
government.
	   He said the current crisis has shown the vulnerability of an
economy when it relies on foreign investment, and urged citizens to
increase their savings to increase domestic capital.
	   Despite spending cuts, Estrada said the government will ensure
continued basic health care and other social services. He indicated
that he wants to trim the bureaucracy but did not elaborate.
	   ``My aim is to help our country escape the recession,'' he said.
``My solutions are obvious. My proposals may be commonplace, but
they were never adopted before. In sum, they are to spend wisely
and less.''

Death count rises as new lands submerged in floods

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Worsening floods have claimed an
additional 21 lives, and the government ordered that helipads be
built in the worst-hit areas so emergency supplies could reach
millions of victims, an official said Monday.
	   Sunday's deaths boosted the death toll from two weeks of
flooding to 96, according to Jawadul Karim, press secretary to the
prime minister. Unofficial estimates put the figure as high as 184.
	   Some 22 million people have been affected by the floods in more
than half of the country's 64 districts, Karim said. About 67,000
people are sheltering in temporary camps.
	   Meanwhile, water has submerged large parts of the
Dhaka-Chittagpong road, threatening communications between the
capital and the port city, the Communication Ministry said.
	   Several hundred workers were dumping sand and bricks on the road
to allow traffic to move.
	   The Flood Forecasting and Warning Center said flooding had
intensified in 18 districts, due to rain water flowing from the
Himalayan foothills in neighboring India.

Swiss-based KLA representatives claim account blocked
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Swiss-based political representatives of the
Kosovo Liberation Army claimed Monday that Swiss authorities had
blocked a bank account used to channel funds to ethnic Albanians in
the troubled Yugoslav province.
	   Mahmuti Bardhyl, a Swiss-based spokesman for the KLA-supporting
Popular Movement of Kosovo, also claimed Swiss police had raided
the houses of three PMK members in Switzerland early Monday.
	   Spokesman for the Swiss federal prosecutor's office, Juerg
Blaser, confirmed that bank accounts had been frozen. He said Swiss
police had arrested several people and seized documents after
searching three individuals' homes in eastern Switzerland around
8am Swiss time (0600 GMT).
	   He said his office would release a statement later in the day.
	   In a telephone conversation with The Associated Press, Bardhyl
claimed the account blocked by the Swiss authorities was the PMK's
biggest account in Switzerland.
	   The account is one of a number used to collect money from the
ethnic Albanian community in Switzerland to fund humanitarian aid
for the Albanian population in Kosovo, Bardhyl said. He was unable
to say how much money the account held.
	   Bardhyl said the homes raided by police belonged to three PMK
members who oversee the accounts for the organization, Agush Buja,
Shaban Muja and Mehmet Bislimi.
	   Two of the individuals, Buja and Muja, were attending police
stations, Bardhyl said. He had no further information.
	   Earlier this month, major powers meeting in the German capital
Bonn to try to stop the fighting between Serb security forces and
the KLA urged governments to intercept the flow of funds to the
ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   They called on all countries to take urgent steps to prevent
funds collected from ethnic Albanians living abroad from being sent
to finance the KLA. Money from abroad is the guerrilla army's main
source of support.

	   Spokesman for the Swiss federal prosecutor's office, Juerg
Blaser, confirmed that bank accounts had been frozen. He said Swiss
police had arrested several people and seized documents after
searching three individuals' homes in eastern Switzerland around
8am Swiss time (0600 GMT).
	   He said his office would release a statement later in the day.
	   In a telephone conversation with The Associated Press, Bardhyl
claimed the account blocked by the Swiss authorities was the PMK's
biggest account in Switzerland.
	   The account is one of a number used to collect money from the
ethnic Albanian community in Switzerland to fund humanitarian aid
for the Albanian population in Kosovo, Bardhyl said. He was unable
to say how much money the account held.
	   Bardhyl said the homes raided by police belonged to three PMK
members who oversee the accounts for the organization, Agush Buja,
Shaban Muja and Mehmet Bislimi.
	   Two of the individuals, Buja and Muja, were attending police
stations, Bardhyl said. He had no further information.
	   Earlier this month, major powers meeting in the German capital
Bonn to try to stop the fighting between Serb security forces and
the KLA urged governments to intercept the flow of funds to the
ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   They called on all countries to take urgent steps to prevent
funds collected from ethnic Albanians living abroad from being sent
to finance the KLA. Money from abroad is the guerrilla army's main
source of support.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Asian and Western nations urged India
and Pakistan on Monday to halt their nuclear weapons programs,
saying they heightened tension in a region already threatened by
instability from an economic breakdown.
	   A statement issued after a meeting of ministers from 20
countries plus the European Union said they ``strongly deplored''
the recent tests. India and Pakistan were not named in the
statement, which called for them to cease nuclear tests and sign
international treaties against further proliferation.
	   India was represented at the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations Regional Forum by deputy planning chairman Jaswant Singh,
who expressed sadness over the statement.
	   He had argued that India had good reasons to conduct the May 11
and 13 tests ``because the non-proliferation regime had turned
flawed and discriminatory.''
	   The statement, which took a day and a half of meetings to
produce, was toned down from earlier drafts, which said the
countries ``condemned'' the testing.
	   Canada's foreign affairs minister, Lloyd Axworthy, said the
message delivered to India and Pakistan was more important than the
precise wording of the statement.
	   ``The message that came across is that the testing is a serious
danger. We have to try to achieve a stop to the arms race,'' he
said.
	   The countries also called on long-term nuclear weapons states
``to make further efforts toward achieving the objective of
eliminating nuclear weapons.''
	   ``There is only one country putting up any defense of India, and
that is India,'' said Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer.
Pakistan is not a member of the annual forum, held to discuss and
defuse issues that could lead to instability in Southeast Asia.
	   The nuclear tension, combined with financial near-collapse or
recession in several East Asian countries, indicates ``we are
meeting at a time characterized more by doubt than by triumph,''
said U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
	   And Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan described the tests as
``plunging South Asia into a sudden wave of tension.''
	   Tang warned that as East Asia's financial crisis continues, new
problems could emerge to threaten regional stability.
	   ``Economic security has increasingly become an inseparable part
of national and regional security,'' he said. The crisis ``broke
out ferociously ... no less than that of a war.''
	   The devaluation of the Thai baht in July 1997 unleashed
speculative attacks against currencies in the region and started
East Asia's now year-old financial crisis.
	   Albright and Japan's prime minister-in-waiting Keizo Obuchi,
representing the world's two largest economies, met on the
sidelines of the forum and pledged major efforts to lift Asia out
of its financial doldrums.
	   Obuchi said his top priorities _ once he is formally promoted
from foreign minister to prime minister later this week _ are
ending Japan's own recession and ``making a contribution to Asia.''
	   He told Albright he would overcome his reputation for
indecisiveness by following through on a campaign pledge to enact a
package of a dlrs 43 billion tax cut and dlrs 71 billion in
government spending, U.S. officials said.
	   Albright said the United States has ``a vital security interest
in speeding Asia's recovery.'' But even with assistance from the
United States and international lending institutions, the road to
recovery is a tough one.
	   ``There is no question the region will recover. ... The real
question is whether it will emerge stronger, more open, more
democratic, better equipped to meet new challenges,'' she said.

Appointment of ex-KGB agent designed to strengthen security
</HEADLINE>
service &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ When President Boris Yeltsin was dismantling the
Soviet system, one of his first moves was to disband the KGB. Now
that Russia is awash with new problems, Yeltsin is looking to the
former KGB for help.
	   Yeltsin appointed former KGB spy Vladimir Putin as head of
Russia's Federal Security Service over the weekend, a move designed
to augment the power of the KGB's main successor agency, Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said Monday.
	   The move is aimed at ``strengthening and fortifying the service,
as well as returning some of its unfairly lost authority,''
Kiriyenko said.
	   When the KGB was split into several services following the 1991
Soviet collapse, the Federal Security Service became its main
successor, but with less influence and power.
	   However, Yeltsin has recently been moving the other direction,
expanding the FSB's clout and tapping into the KGB's experience of
imposing control and gathering information.
	   Earlier this year, Yeltsin brought Russia's border guards under
the control of the FSB, giving it a broader mandate in dealing with
issues involving counter-intelligence and domestic security.
	   Then the president appointed three former KGB agents to key jobs
in his administration that deal with Russia's far-flung regions,
where maverick local leaders have caused headaches for the Kremlin.
	   Putin was one of those agents, and until his appointment this
weekend he was first deputy chief of staff in charge of relations
with Russia's regions.
	   Now, with the new promotion of the 45-year-old former spy, the
FSB could be regaining some of the power that one belonged to its
predecessor agency.
	   ``The choice of Vladimir Putin for the post is not accidental,''
Kiriyenko told the FSB's staff as he introduced the new boss on
Monday.
	   As a former intelligence officer stationed in Germany, Putin is
familiar with the whole spectrum of FSB work, and is also an expert
on economic and regional issues, Kiriyenko was quoted as saying by
the ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agencies.
	   Regional officials have been blamed for misspending federal
funds allocated to the regions _ thereby contributing to the
chronic problem of unpaid wages and pensions that touched off
recent strikes and protests.
	   Putin's priorities as FSB chief will be combating economic
espionage and illegal capital flight, Kiriyenko said.
	   Kiriyenko denied speculation that Putin's predecessor, Nikolai
Kovalyov, was dismissed in response to his handling of several
recent incidents, including a spy dispute with South Korea.
	   At least one politician called Putin's appointment
ill-considered.
	   Kovalyov ``was a professional, knowledgeable, reasonable
person,'' said Viktor Ilyukhin, a leading Communist lawmaker and
staunch Yeltsin opponent. ``I'm afraid Putin does not have these
qualities. He still needs to gather political experience.''

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Ballot counting from parliamentary
elections progressed slowly Monday as Cambodians waited to see
whether the outcome would be a new government bringing peace and
stability or still more turmoil for their tragedy-stricken nation.
	   None of the three main parties seemed likely to win a majority
of the 122 seats in the National Assembly, making some kind of
coalition likely between strongman Hun Sen and his two chief
challengers, Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy.
	   The National Election Committee estimated turnout Sunday was at
least 90 percent of the 5.4 million registered voters. First
partial results were scheduled to be announced Monday night.
	   International election monitors said it was too early to predict
an outcome, but Glenys Kinnock, special representative of the
European Union, the largest foreign election donor, urged the three
top candidates to accept the results.
	   ``Hopefully, whatever happens, they'll work together on
reconciliation,'' Kinnock said as she toured Phnom Penh's largest
counting station, a sweltering school building packed with counting
officials, party workers and observers. Overall, observers said,
counting was going smoothly.
	   Former U.S. congressman Stephen Solarz, heading a separate
American observation mission, met King Norodom Sihanouk in the
northern city of Siem Reap and described the 75-year-old monarch as
feeling ``positive'' about the elections.
	   ``He felt there were some problems with it, but on balance
seemed to feel it looked pretty good,'' Solarz said.
	   In the northern jungles around Anlong Veng, a former stronghold
of the Khmer Rouge, Gen. Chea Mann, the regional military
commander, said the situation was calm after hard-line Khmer Rouge
rebels attacked a military position Sunday, leaving 10 people dead.
	   There were no plans to increase security, given the large number
of government troops already in the area, Chea Mann said. Ballots
were being brought in from around the area to Anlong Veng for
counting.
	   The elections made history when thousands of Khmer Rouge from
Anlong Veng and elsewhere who have made peace in recent years voted
for the first time in their lives. The few hundred hard-liners
still fighting, however, vowed to disrupt the process.
	   When the ultraradical revolutionaries ruled Cambodia between
1975 and 1979, causing the death of as many as 2 million people,
advocating voting would have meant death.
	   The attack had little impact on the rest of the country.
Cambodia was far more troubled in the pre-election period by
violence, including murder, and intimidation blamed on Hun Sen to
ensure victory for his Cambodian People's Party.
	   Sam Rainsy, whose party bore the brunt of the violence, claimed
that partial results obtained by his workers at counting stations
Monday indicated a crushing defeat for Hun Sen's CPP. He predicted
a major shakeup in the political landscape.
	   ``I cannot say who has won, but who has lost _ the CPP,'' Sam
Rainsy said.
	   Fears persisted that trouble may lie ahead after results become
known and the political leaders, who harbor grudges against each
other, maneuver for position. An arrangement without Hun Sen is
hard to imagine, since he controls the security forces.
	   Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC won U.N.-sponsored elections backed by
20,000 peacekeepers in 1993. But Hun Sen, who came to power in 1985
under the Vietnamese military occupation that followed the Khmer
Rouge, forced his way into a co-premiership by threatening civil
war.
	   A year ago, Hun Sen ordered tanks into Phnom Penh and deposed
Ranariddh in two days of fighting. He allowed Ranariddh to return
from nine months of exile to contest the new elections in a bid to
win back international legitimacy and aid.
	   Thun Saray, president of the Committee for Free Elections in
Cambodia, told a news conference that ``if the ruling party gets
one-third, I worry perhaps we will have some problems.''

Ukraine fines nuclear plants for safety violations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Citing a growing number of malfunctions at
Ukraine's five atomic power plants, the country's top nuclear
safety official said Monday his department will fine plants that
violate safety norms.
	   Fines will be imposed for poor repairs, untimely reports of
disruptions and malfunctions, disregard for safety rules and using
faulty reactors, said Oleksandr Smyshlyayev, who heads the
Environment Protection Ministry's nuclear division.
	   Earlier this month, Smyshlyayev issued a similar warning, saying
the number of malfunctions in the first half of this year totaled
37 _ 1.5 times more than over the same period in 1997. He blamed
outdated equipment and failure to observe safety rules.
	   On Monday, he attacked Ukraine's Energy Ministry, saying it was
presenting the current lack of fines ``as proving the lack of
malfunctions at nuclear power plants,'' according to the Interfax
news agency.
	   In fact, nuclear regulators have deliberately avoided fines
since 1997 due to the plants' difficult economic situation, and
were only fining those persons found responsible for failures,
Smyshlyayev said.
	   The new fines ``would become an additional financial burden for
nuclear power plants, since they might reach several million hryvna
(dollars),'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, nuclear officials reported a fresh malfunction at the
Rivne atomic power plant, the 15th this year and the second in less
than a week.
	   The plant's only working reactor was shut down Saturday because
of an electric transformer failure and resumed work Sunday, said
the state-run Energoatom company, which is in charge of Ukraine's
nuclear power industry.
	   On Thursday, the same No. 1 reactor was shut down because of a
steam generator failure.
	   The northwestern Rivne power plant ranks second among Ukraine's
nuclear facilities by the number of malfunctions in 1998. The
southeastern Zaporizhya plant, Europe's largest, has had the most
malfunctions.
	   Ukraine relies on nuclear energy for more than half of its
electricity, and says it does not have enough money to convert to
other forms of energy or build safer nuclear plants.

Most Asian stock markets close lower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed lower Monday,
with share prices tumbling in Hong Kong and Tokyo on worries that
Japan's new leader would not be able to boost the country's
economy.
	   The Hang Seng Index, Hong Kong's key indicator of blue chips,
fell 273.03 points, or 3.3 percent, closing at 7,984.43. It was the
first time in six weeks that the index had closed below 8,000
points.
	   Brokers said investors worried over whether Foreign Minister
Keizo Obuchi, who was elected Friday to head Japan's ruling Liberal
Democratic Party, would be able reverse the country's faltering
economy.
	   Obuchi is virtually certain to become Japan's prime minister,
replacing Ryutaro Hashimoto, who resigned early this month after
the party suffered a major setback in parliamentary elections.
	   In Tokyo, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average sank
417.53 points, or 2.55 percent, closing at 15,944.36 _ its first
close below 16,000 since June 30. On Friday, the average had gained
173.88 points, or 1.07 percent.
	   Investors worried that Obuchi is ill-suited to push through
tough reforms needed to reverse the sagging economy, traders said.
``We need someone to come in with a chain saw,'' said Louis Tseng,
head of the Tokyo derivatives department at Jardine Fleming
Securities Co. ``Not only does (Obuchi) not have a chain saw, he
may not even have a hacksaw.''
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar gained against the yen amid growing
unease about an Obuchi-led government and concern over the plunge
in Tokyo stock prices.
	   The dollar was quoted at 142.34 yen in late afternoon, up 1.80
yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate
of 141.44 yen Friday.
	   Elsewhere:
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Share prices closed sharply lower in reaction to
the downgrading of Malaysia's sovereign ratings last week by
Moody's and Standard and Poor's. The Composite Index fell 10.36
points, or 2.5 percent, to 408.04.
	   BANGKOK: Thai stock prices closed lower because of regional
uncertainty over Japan's economy. The Stock Exchange of Thailand
index fell 5.51 points, or 2.0 percent, to 269.93.
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed slightly lower. The market's key
Weighted Stock Price Index fell 12.10 points to 7,890.30.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices finished lower, with the
stock exchange closing about 30 minutes early because of technical
problems with the computer trading system. The NZSE-40 Capital
Index fell 8.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,104.83.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed lower in the absence of
positive regional and local developments, traders said. The
Philippine Stock Exchange Index of 30 selected issues fell 19.69
points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,661.19.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed lower, dragged down by
weaker regional markets. The All Ordinaries Index fell 30.2 points,
or 1.1 percent, to 2,715.3.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed slightly higher on bargain-hunting.
The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 1.46 points, or 0.4
percent, to 329.80.
	   SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mostly unchanged. The benchmark
Straits Times Industrials Index fell 2.55 points, or 0.2 percent,
to 1,067.81.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed closed higher as fears eased of
more social unrest in Indonesia. The Composite Index rose 3.418
points, or 0.7 percent, to 482.981.

<TEXT>
	   BROOKLYN, Michigan (AP) _ A crash at the U.S. 500 auto race
hurled a tire and other car parts into the grandstand, killing
three spectators and injuring six others.
	   It was the first time in more than a decade that spectators were
killed in an accident in a major auto race.
	   Dr. Gregory Baumann, the chief medical director at Michigan
Speedway, said two people died instantly Sunday from the impact of
the debris. A third person later died at one of the track's medical
units.
	   Six spectators were taken by helicopter to Foote Hospital in
Jackson, where they were listed in stable condition with injuries
ranging from a fractured leg to neck and back injuries, hospital
officials said.
	   A car driven by Adrian Fernandez of Mexico, the pole winner for
the Championship Auto Racing Teams race, slid into the wall on lap
175 of the 250-lap race.
	   His right front tire and pieces of the suspension broke off,
flying into the crowd in the fourth-turn grandstand. Fernandez, who
was in third place at the time of the crash, suffered bruised
knees.
	   As he heard the noise of the crash below, Gerald Bramer stood up
to see what was happening. ``The next thing I know, a tire was
flying in the air right at us,'' said Bramer, who attend the race
with his brother Rich.
	   Bramer said he threw up his arm to block the tire as it brushed
by him. It hit his brother in the back, but neither was injured
seriously.
	   Becky Lutgen was at the track with her boyfriend watching
Fernandez's car as it rounded the bend. She said they didn't see
the tire from his car until it hit the stands and then landed about
four or five rows behind them.
	   ``It ricocheted in the stands and came to rest between some
rows. It went by so fast,'' Lutgen said.
	   The fourth-turn grandstand area where the spectators were hit
was cleared immediately and a medical examiner's investigation
began.
	   The U.S. 500, run before a crowd of about 50,000, continued
after the accident and was won By Greg Moore.
	   ``It's terrible, a tragedy,'' said Jimmy Vasser, the runner-up.
``We don't want to see that happen.''
	   Michael Terry Tautkus, 49, and Sheryl Ann Laster, 40, both of
Milan; and Kenneth Dale Fox, 38, of Lansing were killed in the
accident, authorities said.
	   The injured, all from Michigan, were identified as David Silva,
35, of Dearborn; Gerald Bramer, 31, and Richard Bramer, 20, both of
Livonia; Doris Shuman, 70, of West Bloomfield; Joyce Thompson, 48,
of Spring Arbor, and Steve Dawson, 31, of Lansing.
	   Silva, the Bramers and Thompson were all treated and released.
	   The deaths were the first among spectators at the track since
1969, when one fan was killed during a Trans-Am race on the road
course.
	   At the 1987 Indianapolis 500, a tire bounded off the track,
landing in the top row of the grandstand and killing a fan. There
have been other spectator deaths since at drag races and other auto
events.

<TEXT>
	   HOOGBLOKLAND, Netherlands (AP) _ An 18-year-old British man was
killed when he stuck his head out of the roof window of a bus and
slammed into a viaduct, police said Monday.
	   The victim, identified by a Dutch newspaper as Stephen Adair of
Stamford Bridge, near York, was facing the rear of the bus and
didn't see the viaduct. He likely died instantly, said regional
police spokesman Wim Grueleus.
	   Adair was traveling with a group of 47 people ages 15 to 20 who
had just spent a week visiting a British military base in
Osnabruck, Germany.
	   Their bus was heading toward Calais, France, when the accident
occurred on Saturday near this central Dutch town, about 50
kilometers (30 miles) south of Amsterdam.
	   The British bus driver said the passengers were somewhat unruly
and that other youths also had stuck their heads out of the
emergency roof window for fun, according to a police press release.

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ While the men still wiped sweat off
their faces after 45 minutes of laps and pushups, Sgt. Sara Milhem
already stood in position, ready for inspection, hands behind her
back, eyes focused straight ahead.
	   Milhem, 38, is the only woman in a 100-member special force
created by the Palestinian Authority to keep peace in troubled
Hebron after Israeli troops withdrew from most of the city in 1997.
	   Acceptance has not come easy.
	   Her colleagues took bets she wouldn't last, and her authority
was often challenged in a town where Palestinian teen-agers armed
with stones frequently clash with Israeli soldiers guarding Jewish
settler compounds.
	   During one recent flareup, Milhem had to wrestle a motorist out
of his car before he agreed to move the vehicle. ``They usually
ignore my orders until I get a bit rough with them,'' said Milhem,
dressed in a black uniform, an AK-47 assault rifle slung over her
shoulder and a club and pistol strapped to her belt.
	   Such resistance comes as no surprise in the deeply conservative
Palestinian society in which men control positions of power while
women are largely confined to roles of mother and homemaker.
	   Since 1994, thousands of women have entered the job market with
the creation of the Palestinian Authority's government bureaucracy,
but nearly all work in lower-level positions.
	   It takes individual effort to change the pattern.
	   Milhem's commander, Jamil Bakri, said his traditional attitude
toward women changed when he fought alongside them during the
1987-93 Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation.
	   ``We had women with us in the streets and we had women in
Israeli jails who withstood beatings,'' said Bakri, who heads the
Hebron office of the Preventive Security Service, which does both
police and intelligence work and oversees the 100-member special
force.
	   Bakri believes hiring more women will make his force more
effective. For example, female officers can confront women during
house searches while male officers could be reluctant to do so for
fear their actions might be interpreted as an untoward advance.
	   While Milhem is the only woman in the team, 50 of the 400
Preventive Security officers in Hebron are women, some in senior
positions as interrogators, legal advisers and evidence analysts.
	   Bakri strictly enforces proper on-the-job relations between men
and women because he wants continued support from the community.
	   He recalled an incident in which a male officer made an
inappropriate remark to a female colleague. The women threw an
empty soda bottle at the man, earning a reprimand for using force _
but also winning praise from her bosses for standing up for
herself.
	   ``The strict ethical code is what makes the families accept that
their daughters work here,'' said Milhem, who got her husband's
permission before applying to the special team.
	   Sheikh Jamal Salim, a leading Muslim preacher in the West Bank
town of Nablus, said Islam does not keep women out of combat, but
added that riot control assignments involving close physical
contact between men and women might be a problem.
	   ``Islam prefers that the women not be put in these situations,
but there is no ruling against it,'' Salim said.
	   Milhem said she was first pulled away from the traditional path
of Palestinian women when two of her brothers were shot dead in
street clashes with Israeli soldiers during the Palestinian
uprising.
	   Seeking revenge, she joined Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's
Fatah movement, which was outlawed by Israel at the time. She
joined a special Fatah ``strike force'' _ the only woman in the
Hebron area to do so _ and went out at night to ambush Israeli army
patrols with rocks and firebombs.
	   In 1996, she joined the interrogation department of Preventive
Security, but had her eye on the special force. She was accepted
after some argument, but had to work extra hard to catch up to the
men who had begun training four months earlier.
	   These days, Milhem gets up at dawn to clean the house and get
the children ready for school. The youngest, a 5-year-old boy,
stays with relatives.
	   At 6 a.m., she reports for morning exercises.
	   During a reporter's recent visit, the officers did pushups,
sit-ups and karate drills and also dismantled AK-47s during a
45-minute workout. Milhem did not break a sweat as she circled a
helipad near Preventive Security headquarters in a high-stepping
jog.
	   Milhem feels she is not only fulfilling her own ambition, but
paving the way for other women.
	   ``I wanted to prove that women can do tough and dangerous work
as well as the men,'' she said.

Albright denounces government of Myanmar

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Myanmar, Philippine foreign minister
comments &QL;

 &UR; By TOM RAUM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on Monday denounced the military-ruled government of
Myanmar and said the United States would hold it ``directly
responsible'' for the health and welfare of Nobel laureate Aung San
Suu Kyi.
	   ``I just wanted to make quite clear how we deplore the
government of Burma's refusal to allow members of the National
League for Democracy, a legal political party, to travel freely,''
Albright told a news conference.
	   It was the sharpest condemnation recently by the United States
of the government of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, heads
Myanmar's pro-democracy party, the National League for Democracy.
She was stopped by police Friday while driving to meet with NLD
members and, as Albright spoke, was preparing to spend her fourth
night in her car.
	   Myanmar Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw was asked by The Associated
Press to comment on Albright's concerns for Suu Kyi. ``Nothing will
happen to her,'' he said of the opposition leader.
	   Albright called the news conference after Ohn Gyaw defended his
nation's conduct at a forum here of the nine-nation Association of
Southeast Asian Nations and its Pacific Rim neighbors.
	   ``The Burmese representative here has just ... responded to the
allegations, and I think his response is quite typical of an
authoritarian government that just doesn't get it, that blames the
victim for the problem,'' Albright said.
	   The ASEAN sessions have been private.
	   The host, Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Domingo
Siazon, said later that Albright's statement of concern was ``just
too vague'' for the rest of the group.
	   ``We have not seen any deterioration in (Suu Kyi's) health or
capacity to think,'' he told a news conference.
	   Speaking to the closed-door ASEAN Regional Forum earlier,
Albright said that conditions in Myanmar have worsened during the
past year, despite progress on political reforms in other parts of
Asia.
	   ``With each passing day,'' she said, ``the likelihood of social
breakdown _ or explosion _ that would undermine regional stability
grows higher.''
	   Albright devoted much of her speech to criticizing Myanmar's
government. The forum, which includes the United States and other
major powers in Asia and the West, focuses on security issues.
	   Myanmar joined ASEAN last year after supporters argued that its
inclusion would encourage economic and political reform.
	   Albright spoke as Suu Kyi's highway standoff in Myanmar
continued. Suu Kyi was stopped Friday morning 32 miles (51
kilometers) west of the capital while driving to Bassein, 100 miles
(161 kilometers) west of Yangon, to meet members of her political
party.
	   ``We believe that freedom of movement is fundamental, and that
its denial can only increase the already dangerous state of tension
in Burma. We are gravely concerned about the health and safety of
Aung San Suu Kyi and will hold the Burmese authorities directly
responsible for insuring her health and welfare,'' Albright said.
	   Albright told reporters she doubted that she could persuade the
ASEAN ministers to issue a statement condemning Myanmar because to
do so would require consensus, meaning approval from Myanmar
itself.
	   A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
quoted Siazon as saying that some of Myanmar's fellow ASEAN members
were disappointed by the lack of progress there and that Ohn Gyaw
had endured some ``tough discussions.''
	   At the forum's closing news conference, Siazon said that
sensitive issues had been discussed and he hoped Ohn Gyaw was
``learning from his experience'' in ASEAN.
	   However, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, one of the main
supporters of Myanmar's membership, denied Sunday that Myanmar had
been strongly criticized in any group meetings.
	   Myanmar's junta rose to power after crushing pro-democracy
demonstrations in 1988. It recently has clamped down on opponents
since Suu Kyi set an Aug. 21 deadline for the government to allow
the national assembly, elected in 1990, to convene. Suu Kyi's
National League for Democracy swept the election, but the military
refused to recognize the results.

Peacekeepers' vehicle blown up by mine in Abkhazia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ A land mine blew up an armored personnel
carrier in Georgia's breakaway province of Abkhazia on Monday,
injuring several Russian peacekeepers, officials said.
	   The Abkhazian Deputy Interior Minister Konstantin Adleiba said
two peacekeepers were killed and three injured in the blast in the
Ghali region, but the peacekeepers' command only said that three
servicemen were injured, Interfax news agency reported.
	   Adleiba blamed the attack on pro-Georgian militia groups
operating in the region, which is Abkhazia's usual explanation for
such attacks.
	   But Georgia's Bondo Dzhikiya, presidential representative to the
regions bordering the separatist province, blamed Abkhazian
separatists and peacekeepers themselves for failing to ensure order
in the volatile region.
	   ``The zone is controlled by Abkhazians and peacekeepers,''
Dzhikiya told The Associated Press. ``It is they who should care
about safety in the zone.''
	   Georgian officials have repeatedly accused Russian peacekeepers
of being too soft on separatists.
	   ``I am not going to accuse everyone now _ as Abkhazians do _ for
planting the mine,'' Dzhikiya said. ``Let them investigate first.
But in my opinion such provocations are staged to aggravate the
situation on the eve of the U.N. Security Council session on
Abkhazia.''
	   Last week, nine Russian peacekeepers were killed when their
truck was blown up by a radio-activated mine in Abkhazia. On July
11, five more soldiers were killed in a similar incident.
	   The peacekeepers were sent to stabilize the Black Sea province
of Abkhazia in 1994 following a war between Georgian government
troops and Abkhazian separatists. Large-scale fighting has ended,
but sporadic clashes have continued, despite the peacekeepers'
presence.

Myanmar military says Suu Kyi colluding with Western embassies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-ASEAN-Myanmar &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ As Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi
spent a fourth day stuck in a car on a rural highway surrounded by
government security personnel, a Myanmar government spokesman
accused her of colluding with Western embassies to put pressure on
the military regime.
	   Suu Kyi was stopped by local authorities Friday morning about 51
miles (32 miles) west of Yangon as she attempted to drive to
Bassein, 160 kilometers (100 miles) west of the capital, to meet
members of her political party, the National League for Democracy.
	   They refused to let her proceed and she has refused to return to
Yangon. She, a colleague and two drivers have spent three nights in
the car and were preparing to spend a fourth.
	   A government officer said he believed she had enough food and
water to spend a week in the car. A government spokesman called the
episode a publicity stunt and said the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize
winner was being helped by Western embassies.
	   ``The NLD leadership has colluded with some Western embassies in
Yangon and has secured support and necessary assistance from them
once an incident has been deliberately created,'' the military
government said in a statement faxed to Bangkok.
	   ``Regretfully, the NLD has deliberately and obviously planned
this incident to coincide with the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting
currently in progress in Manila and also to induce participating
countries to berate the government of Myanmar for its own action,''
the statement said.
	   ASEAN is the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, whose
members are Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and _ since last year _ Laos and
Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   U.S. officials said Sunday that Myanmar's foreign minister was
receiving some tough talk from his ASEAN counterparts in Manila for
the regime's lack of progress on democratic and economic reforms.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, also in Manila to
attend a meeting of the ASEAN Regional Forum, warned Myanmar's
military government that the United States will hold it ``directly
responsible'' for Suu Kyi's health and welfare.
	   She said the situation in Myanmar had only worsened since it was
admitted to ASEAN.
	   ``With each passing day,'' she said, ``the likelihood of social
breakdown _ or explosion _ that would undermine regional stability
grows higher.''
	   Myanmar's military government came to power in 1988 after
violently crushing a nationwide democracy uprising. It ignored the
results of a 1990 election that Suu Kyi's party won by a landslide.
	   Suu Kyi has called on the military to allow the parliament
elected in that poll to convene by Aug. 21. The military has not
responded.

	   A summary of late financial and business news from The
Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed lower Monday,
with share prices tumbling in Hong Kong and Tokyo on worries that
Japan's new leader would not be able to boost the country's
economy. The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong's key indicator of blue
chips, fell 273.03 points, or 3.3 percent, closing at 7,984.43. It
was the first time in six weeks that the index had closed below
8,000 points. Brokers said investors worried over whether Foreign
Minister Keizo Obuchi, who is virtually certain to become Japan's
prime minister, would be able reverse the country's faltering
economy. In Tokyo, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
sank 417.53 points, or 2.55 percent, closing at 15,944.36 _ its
first close below 16,000 since June 30. On Friday, the average had
gained 173.88 points, or 1.07 percent. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The man expected to become Japan's next prime
minister focused Monday on his choice for finance chief, a key
appointment in his effort to turn around the country's sagging
economy. Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, elected last week as
president of the ruling party, was reportedly leaning toward former
Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, a ruling party elder and economic
specialist. Obuchi was expected to ask Miyazawa to take the key
post in a new Cabinet expected to be announced later this week, the
national newspaper Yomiuri reported Monday. Miyazawa is widely
respected as an internationalist and an expert on financial
affairs. Obuchi may also ask Miyazawa to serve as deputy prime
minister, the Yomiuri said. The Japanese finance minister will
grapple with its worst recession in decades, record-high
unemployment and bankruptcies, and a financial system weighed down
by mountains of bad debt. (JAPAN-POLITICS)
	   LONDON (AP) _ In the latest move to expand its reach, AT and T
is forming a joint venture with British Telecommunications that
will combine their international operations and develop a new
Internet-type of network. The tie-up, announced at a news
conference Sunday, follows the failure of an earlier plan by BT to
acquire MCI Communications Corp., the No. 2 U.S. carrier behind AT
and T. BT was outbid by rival WorldCom Inc. Investors applauded the
deal, sending BT shares up by 8 percent to 892 pence (dlrs 14.81)
early Monday on the London Stock Exchange. The new company, which
has yet to be named, is expected to have revenues of dlrs 10
billion a year and employ some 5,000 people. It will be based in
the eastern United States and will be run by executives from both
BT and AT and T. The BT chairman, Sir Iain Vallance, will be its
first chairman. (BRITISH TELECOM-AT and T)
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ In another sign of consolidation in
the global auto industry, Daimler-Benz AG and Nissan Diesel Motor
Co. of Japan said Monday they would jointly build a light truck
starting in 2002 as a first step toward a broader alliance. Nissan
Motor, Japan's second-largest automaker, and Daimler, Germany's
largest industrial group, said in May they were in talks on a
possible alliance or joint venture. Daimler, which has been looking
to strengthen its global position, is buying Chrysler to expand its
presence in the U.S. market, and has said it wants to double its
market share in Asia within the next 10 years to at least 20
percent. (GERMANY-DAILMER-NISSAN)
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Striking Hyundai Motor Co. workers
expanded their week-long protest against layoffs by picketing the
company's head office in Seoul on Monday. Hundreds of helmeted riot
police, armed with plastic shields and meter- (yard-) long batons,
guarded the headquarters of South Korea's largest automaker as 300
workers tried to barge into the building. ``Death rather than
layoff,'' the workers shouted. The protesters were among 5,000
Hyundai workers who have been picketing car assembly lines in
Ulsan, 280 kilometers (175 miles) southeast of Seoul, since last
Monday, protesting the company's plan to lay off 2,678 workers by
this weekend. (SKOREA-LABOR)
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Bankruptcies and business closures are on the
rise in Singapore as its vulnerable economy stalls, job losses
increase and fatalism sets in, according to a news report on
Monday. Personal bankruptcies rose 20 percent to 986 in the first
half of 1998 compared to last year, of which 41 percent were due to
failed businesses and 16 percent to job losses, reported The
Straits Times. Company closures also jumped during the economically
trying period. Small to medium enterprises fared worst, with 42
percent of these closures among companies with paid-up capital of
between 100,000 to 500,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs 58,000 to
291,000). (SINGAPORE-ECONOMY)

	   Mother Teresa's successor, Sister Nirmala, was expected to fly
from Calcutta to visit the branch on Tuesday, the official said.
	   The Missionaries of Charity order has been in Yemen since 1970
and has four branches in the country's main cities, with a total of
25 workers. They help an estimated 450 physically and mentally
handicapped people.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Ballot counting from parliamentary
elections progressed slowly Monday as Cambodians waited to see
whether the outcome would be a new government that would bring
peace and stability or still more turmoil to their tragedy-stricken
nation. None of the three main parties seemed likely to win an
outright majority of the 122 seats in the National Assembly, making
some kind of coalition likely between strongman Hun Sen and his two
main challengers, Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy. The
National Election Committee estimated turnout Sunday was at least
90 percent of the 5.4 million registered voters. First partial
results were scheduled to be announced Monday night.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Backed by tanks, Serb forces are
pressing their offensive in what Albanian leaders see as a move by
the government to bolster its position before more talks on the
future of Kosovo province. Serb sources reported tough fighting
Sunday in the rugged hills of central and western Kosovo as police
battled the Kosovo Liberation Army for control of key roads linking
the provincial capital Pristina with major towns to the west and
south. The offensive _ the most widespread and coordinated Serb
operation since April _ appeared aimed at clearing KLA fighters
from three strategic highways. If successful, the operation would
split the estimated one-third of the province under rebel control
and block routes to their sanctuaries in neighboring Albania, from
which the insurgents smuggle weapons. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Asian and Western nations urged India
and Pakistan on Monday to halt their nuclear weapons programs,
saying they heightened tension in a region already threatened by
instability from an economic breakdown. Ministers from 19 countries
plus the European Union were behind a relatively mild statement
that ``strongly deplored'' the recent tests, according to a draft
communique. India and Pakistan were not named in the draft copy,
which urged them to cease nuclear tests and sign international
treaties against further proliferation. India, the 21st member of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum, had held
out against the criticism, arguing that it had good reasons to
conduct the May tests. (ASEAN)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on Monday denounced the military-ruled government of
Myanmar and said the United States would hold it ``directly
responsible'' for the health and welfare of Nobel laureate Aung San
Suu Kyi. It was the sharpest condemnation yet by the United States
of the government of Mynamar, formerly known as Burma. Suu Kyi, 53,
winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, heads Myanmar's pro-democracy
party, the National League for Democracy. She was stopped by police
on Friday while driving to meet with NLD members and, as Albright
spoke, was preparing to spend her third night in her car.
(ASEAN-MYANMAR)
	   DILI, Indonesia _ Steering toward a solution to the East Timor
conflict, Indonesia's reform-minded government says that on Tuesday
it will begin pulling out some of the 12,000 soldiers who patrol
the rugged, half-island territory. In a heavily hyped event, the
troops will assemble Tuesday for a farewell ceremony in Dili, East
Timor's capital, before boarding ships bound for military barracks
in less volatile regions. At a demonstration Monday in the coastal
town of Baucau, pro-independence activists welcomed the gesture
even though it falls short of their desire for a vote on
self-determination for their homeland, declared part of Indonesia
in 1976. (INDONESIA-TIMOR TROOPS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Launching a pivotal week in the Monica
Lewinsky investigation, the White House is working to strike a
compromise with prosecutor Kenneth Starr that could avoid direct
testimony by President Bill Clinton. Starr is investigating whether
Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern, lied under
oath about the nature of their relationship and then sought to
cover it up. Aides would not confirm publicly that the president
has been subpoenaed to testify. But an official close to Clinton,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said a subpoena was served last
week on the president's private attorney, David Kendall, and that
it requires Clinton to appear at the grand jury as early as
Tuesday. Clinton's attorneys are hoping to avoid having Clinton
personally appear before the grand jury and instead provide
information in a less-sensational format, such as a videotaped
deposition.(US-CLINTON INVESTIGATION)

Situation calm after attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Boxes filled with ballots cast by
former Khmer Rouge guerrillas were sent Monday to their one-time
stronghold of Anlong Veng for counting, a day after their hard-line
former comrades cast a pall over Cambodia's parliamentary elections
with an attack that left 10 people dead.
	   ``All the ballot boxes have been returned to Anlong Veng town,''
said Gen. Chea Mann, regional military commander for the Anlong
Veng area. ``The situation all along the border, including Anlong
Veng, looks calm now.''
	   The election Sunday represented a historic milestone, with
thousands of former Khmer Rouge guerrillas who have made peace with
the government over the past two years voting for the first time in
their lives. But a few hundred of their hard-line ex-comrades
operating along the border with Thailand vowed to disrupt the
process.
	   As millions of Cambodians voted peacefully around the country
Sunday, a group of 30 to 40 heavily armed guerrillas attacked a
government army position 10 kilometers (6 miles) west of Anlong
Veng. One guerrilla, two soldiers and seven civilians were reported
killed. The attack did not interrupt voting in the area.
	   Two people wounded in the attack were flown by helicopter Monday
for hospital treatment.
	   On July 17, a smaller group of rebels attacked a convoy carrying
election workers and materials. Two people were killed. Election
materials were set on fire.
	   Due to security concerns in Anlong Veng, national and
international election observers were not present to monitor the
voting process.
	   Chea Mann said Monday said the security situation should remain
stable after election day, adding that the government has plenty of
troops there.
	   Tea Chamrath, a former defense minister and a security official
with the National Election Committee, also played down tensions:
``When people vote already, it's safe, the security is OK.''
	   The Khmer Rouge caused the deaths of as many as 2 million
Cambodians when it ruled between 1975 and 1979. It was toppled by
an invasion from Vietnam, but waged guerrilla war against
successive governments.
	   In U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993, when the Khmer Rouge
remained a serious fighting force, some 20,000 peacekeeping troops
were sent to Cambodia for security.

India, Pakistan criticized over nuclear tests

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with release of statement deploring nuclear
tests, Indian reaction, other details &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos ASEAN 101-113 &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Asian and Western nations at a
regional security forum were disappointed Monday with India's
response to criticism of its nuclear tests.
	   ``There is only one country putting up any defense of India, and
that is India,'' Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said
after heated debate at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
Regional Forum.
	   He said there was ``very deep concern about the Indian and
Pakistani nuclear tests and the challenge they have thrown up to
the non-proliferation regime which has served the world so well for
the last 30 years.''
	   Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan described the tests as
``plunging South Asia into a sudden wave of tension.''
	   Pakistan is not a member of the forum, which includes 20
countries ranging from Myanmar to the United States. India was
represented by deputy planning chairman Jaswant Singh, who refused
to acknowledge to reporters Sunday night that he had ever heard of
any criticism of the May 11 and 13 nuclear tests.
	   He expressed sadness Monday after the forum released a statement
in which other ministers present ``strongly deplored'' the nuclear
tests. The statement said the tests ``exacerbated tension in the
region and raised the specter of a nuclear arms race.''
	   The statement's wording was toned down during one and a half
days of debate from an earlier draft that ``condemned'' the tests
because a few countries believed the group should not denounce its
own members, Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said.
	   Asked why the forum singled out the South Asian countries for
criticism, Siazon replied: ``If you had stood in the old tradition
of Gandhi _ peace, non-violence _ we would have stood with you all
the way.''
	   ``A nuclear test is a nuclear test is a nuclear test,'' added
Siazon, the group's chairman. ``But there is a qualitative
difference from a strategic point of view when you are a
non-nuclear weapons state and make a bomb, and become, or seek to
become a nuclear weapons state. You could tempt other countries to
follow suit.''
	   Singh said India conducted the tests ``to fill a vacuum that
could have resulted in grave and irreparable damage to India's
supreme national interest.''
	   Malaysian Foreign Minister Ahmad Badawi said Singh's defense
included both the needs of domestic politics in India and security
concerns regarding China.
	   Southeast Asian nations, which seek to create a nuclear free
zone in their region while pushing the nuclear weapons states
toward full disarmament, were stunned by India's and Pakistan's
recent tests.
	   The annual forum is designed to promote peaceful relations and
defuse potential crises through informal one-on-one and group
meetings among the nine ASEAN foreign ministers and their
counterparts in North America, Europe, elsewhere in Asia and the
South Pacific.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland's premier took over the
chairmanship Monday of the ministry for European integration, which
has been troubled by charges of incompetence and internal
bickering.
	   The move by Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek was expected to raise the
status of the ministry, which is supposed to be preparing Poland
for entry into the European Union, and clarify the division of
responsibilities in the Polish negotiating team.
	   Poland has been repeatedly criticized for sending confusing
signals to EU headquarters in Brussels. The EU cut aid to Poland by
about 20 percent in May because of the poor quality of its grant
applications.
	   Buzek said his action was prompted ``by the very important
decisions and work which await us ...
	   ``It is about representing Poland's interests in a politically
strong way both outside and inside,'' he said.
	   Solidarity's junior partner in the governing coalition, the
liberal Freedom Union, insisted the chairman of the committee be
sacked after the aid was cut.
	   Since then, the committee has been beset by internal conflicts,
with its chief officials publicly insulting each other.
	   Buzek said he had not taken the chairman's job himself right
after the government was formed, as was the case under the previous
Cabinet, because he was too busy with other important reforms.
	   Poland is eager to get started this year on in-depth talks with
the EU on several issues, including foreign policy, industrial
policy, telecommunications, culture and education.
	   The EU indicated it will start talks on those issues, expected
to be relatively simple, even before ending reviewing Poland's laws
and regulations scheduled to last into mid-1999.

Daimler, Nissan to cooperate on building light trucks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quote from Nissan president, additional
background and analyst comment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ In another sign of consolidation in
the global auto industry, Daimler-Benz AG and Nissan Diesel Motor
Co. of Japan said Monday they would jointly build a light truck
starting in 2002 as a first step toward a broader alliance.
	   Nissan Motor, Japan's second-largest automaker, and Daimler,
Germany's largest industrial group, said in May they were in talks
on a possible alliance or joint venture.
	   Daimler, which has been looking to strengthen its global
position, has said it wants to double its market share in Asia
within the next 10 years to at least 20 percent. It already is
buying Chrysler to expand its presence in the U.S. market.
	   ``This cooperation will be an important step to expanding our
truck business in Asia,'' Daimler chairman Juergen Schrempp said in
a statement. ``It will form an integral component of our Asia
strategy.''
	   Yoshikazu Hanawa, president of Nissan Motor, said he is
convinced the alliance ``will play a very important role'' in
strengthening the global operations of the Nissan group.
	   A Nissan official said discussions were continuing about Daimler
possibly taking a major stake in Nissan Diesel, Nissan's truck and
bus making unit.
	   Nissan Diesel has been battered by slumping domestic consumption
and Asia's economic crisis. Nissan Motors reportedly wants to sell
most of its 39 percent share because of the heavy cost of keeping
the affiliate afloat.
	   The new alliance comes amid a spate of mergers in the global
auto industry, which has put pressure on smaller automakers to
consolidate.
	   In addition to the Daimler-Chrysler merger, Volkswagen AG this
year has purchased Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd. and Lamborghini SpA
and is reportedly courting Volvo.
	   And Ford Motor Co. in alliance with Mazda Motor Corp. is bidding
for the troubled Korean automaker Kia Motors Corp.
	   At news conferences in Tokyo and Stuttgart, Daimler and Nissan
said the three-to-nine ton light trucks will be designed for
emerging markets, where demand is growing rapidly.
	   The companies said they are aiming for annual sales of between
100,000 and 150,000 trucks a year by 2005.
	   The joint project, to be manufactured in existing plants, will
serve as a worldwide platform for a new generation of light trucks.
	   The companies will exchange components and combine their
respective development and production know-how. They also will
utilize the sales organizations of Nissan Motor, Nissan Diesel and
Daimler-Benz for the distribution of the new vehicle.
	   Kunihiko Shiohara, analyst at ING Baring Securities in Tokyo,
said the deal is best for Daimler because it gives the German
company access to a sales network with no additional burden.
	   But, he said, it will do little to solve the fundamental problem
of a sagging truck market in Japan and Asia and won't necessarily
pull Nissan Diesel out of its slump.

Commemorative flight leaves for Russia's Far East

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two American and two Russian women pilots took off
from a Moscow airfield Monday on a flight to Russia's Far East
designed to commemorate a landmark flight in Soviet aviation.
	   Nikki Mitchell, one of the American pilots, said the journey is
designed to strengthen Russian-American ties after the fall of the
Soviet Union.
	   In 1938, three Soviet pilots broke the world record for women
aviators for traveling the longest distance non-stop. The
achievement earned them a top Soviet medal, the Gold Star.
	   The commemorate team will fly in Russian-American pairs,
stopping in a number of cities along their route. Two will pilot a
U.S.-made Maule M-5, and the other two will fly a Russian
Antonov-2.
	   When the pilots reach the town of Paulina Osipenko, named after
one of the original three Soviet pilots, the Russians will return
to Moscow and the Americans will complete an around-the-world trip
back to their home in Nashville, Tennessee.
	   The other pilots on the commemorative journey are American
Rhonda Miles, and Russians Khalide Makagonova and Natalia
Vinokorova.

	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Three nuns who worked with the late Mother

clinics in Yemen since 1970 and have never previously been
attacked, Yemeni officials said.
	   The incident is not believed related to the ongoing battles
between Yemeni tribesmen and the government over price hikes put in
place under an economic reform program supervised by the
International Monetary Fund.
	   Since the price increases went into effect June 19, tribesmen
have blown up oil pipelines, ambushed ministers' motorcades and
opened fire on government buildings.
	   Large parts of Yemen are lawless, inhabited by tribes who do not
hesitate to kidnap foreigners or use firearms to settle scores with
rivals.
	   The attack occurred as the nuns were finishing a visit to the
clinic run by the Calcutta-headquartered Roman Catholic order for
physically and mentally handicapped people, the official said.
	   The clinic is in Hodeida, which is 223 kilometers (138 miles)
west of the capital San`a.
	   After hearing of the incident, the Indian and Italian
ambassadors to San`a demanded a thorough and quick investigation
into the incident.
	   Yemen's Health Minister Abdullah Abdul-Wali Nasher visited the
Hodeida branch of the Missionaries of Charity order to express the
government's concern.
	   The religious group was established by Mother Teresa, a Nobel
laureate who died last year.
	   Mother Teresa's successor, Sister Nirmala, was expected to fly
from Calcutta to visit the branch on Tuesday, the Yemeni security
official said.
	   The Missionaries of Charity order has four branches in the
country's main cities, with a total of 25 workers. They help an
estimated 450 physically and mentally handicapped people.

France names Lemerre as successor to World Cup winner Jacquet

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Roger Lemerre was named France's new national
soccer coach on Monday, edging out Jean Tigana to the No. 1 job in
French soccer.
	   Lemerre, whose appointment was widely expected, takes over from
Aime Jacquet, who left the post after guiding France to the World
Cup title on July 12.
	   ``I feel honored to take over the responsibilities of the French
team. I think the position is prestigious, but it is also somewhat
perilous,'' Lemerre told a news conference.
	   Jacquet's assistant since January, 57-year-old Lemerre has
limited experience of top-level management.
	   He played for France six times between 1968 and 1971, before
embarking on an unspectacular coaching career at Red Star, Lens,
Paris FC, Strasbourg and the Tunisian youth team.
	   His main achievement at club level was guiding Lens to promotion
to the first division in 1979.
	   Before joining Jacquet, Lemerre coached the French Army soccer
team for more than a decade, and in 1995 won the World Military
title.
	   French Football Federation officials said that they chose
Lemerre to maintain continuity.
	   In replacing Jacquet, they had to decide whether to tap an
French Football Federation insider or look further afield.
	   Tigana, Monaco's coach, was considered the main outsider, while
some had tipped Auxerre boss Guy Roux.
	   Though Lemerre's appointement was expected, the federation
hesitated, making an appointment a week later than it had initially
planned.
	   ``We were not indecisive,'' said Claude Simonet, FFF president,
explaining that officials needed more time to carry out the
necessary contacts with candidates.
	   Lemerre said that the hoped to continue the modernization of
French soccer that began in the 1970s.
	   ``I want to continue the French school of football,'' he said.
	   ``I am accepting the post for many reasons _ my background as a
professional player and coach at different levels, and my role as
assistant to Aime Jacquet for the last six months.''
	   Lemerre declined to discuss team selection but said that ``we
have a group of great talent.''
	   Apart from the 22 that took part in the World Cup ``we have two
or three young players, under 23 years of age'' who are very good
prospects, Lemerre said.
	   Lemerre has a two-year contract that takes him through the
European Championships in the year 2000, Simonet said.
	   France's next contest is an exhibition match against Austria in
Vienna on August 19, before it travels to Iceland on September 5
for a European Championship qualifier.

Former British captain misses selection for Euros
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Roger Black could quit top-flight
track competition after missing selection to run the 400 meters at
the European Championships in Budapest starting Aug. 18.
	   Black, an Olympic silver medalist and two-time European
400-meter champion, finished fourth at the British AAA meet in
Birmingham on Sunday _ which doubled as the trials for the Euros
and the Commonwealth Games.
	   The 32-year-old finished behind British record-holder Iwan
Thomas, Mark Richardson and Solomon Wariso, who dipped at the line
to beat him for third by a fraction of a second.
	   The first two places automatically qualified for the European
championships but third place was at the selectors' discretion.
	   Wariso, who slashed a second off his personal best to run 44.68
seconds on Sunday, was picked ahead of Black _ who has competed for
Britain since winning the European title in 1986.
	   Black issued a statement Monday saying he was ``in a state of
shock.''
	   ``The third place didn't need to be announced until Aug. 8 _ the
selectors have taken an immediate decision based on 0.003 seconds.
It appears my track record doesn't count for anything,'' he said.
	   ``Over the next few days I have to reflect on my personal
motivation.''
	   To add to the controversy, Wariso admitted after beating Black
on Sunday that he had only entered the 400 ``as a laugh.''
	   The 200-meter specialist, who was banned for three months in
1994 after being sent home from the European Championships for
using the unauthorized substance ephedrine, said he did not want to
race the 400 at Budapest.
	   ``Roger's the boy. He's a natural icon,'' Wariso said.
	   Britain's chairman of selectors, Max Jones, said an hour of the
three-hour selection meeting Sunday night was devoted to the men's
individual 400 meters. Black was selected for the 4-by-400 relay
team.
	   Scotland's Doug Walker won the AAA 200-meter event in 20.35
seconds _ a personal best and the fastest time in Europe this
season.
	   Javelin thrower Steve Backley easily qualified for the European
championships with victory at the AAA championships, while triple
jumper Jonathan Edwards needed only two attempts to win the AAA
title and qualify.
	   World 110-meter hurdles record holder Colin Jackson was also an
automatic selection for the European championships.
	   Selectors picked a team of 37 men and 20 women for the European
championships.
	   Paula Radcliffe will run the 10,000 meters at the Euros but
could miss a start in the Commonwealth Games 5,000 meters because
she did not compete at the AAA championships, where seven women
bettered the qualifying time.
	   The British Commonwealth Games team is expected to be named
Tuesday.

<TEXT>
	   TRABZON, Turkey (AP) _ Nottingham Forest star striker Kevin
Campbell is set to join Turkish Black Sea team Trabzonspor, the
club announced Monday.
	   Campbell, who was expected to arrive in Istanbul Monday evening
to sign for the club, would cost Trabzonspor dlrs 7 million, said
the club's deputy chairman, Hikmet Onur.
	   Campbell, who scored 23 goals last season as Forest won the

transfer this year.

over the team in May for a two-year term. Milne previously guided
Istanbul club Besiktas to two league titles between 1987 and 1993.
	   Trabzonspor finished third in the Turkish first division soccer
league with a 19-9-6 record and 66 points last season.

Health minister backs terminal care, not active euthanasia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's health minister on Monday said doctors
shouldn't keep patients alive against their will, but he stopped
short of calling for a euthanasia law and instead called for better
terminal care.
	   Bernard Kouchner expressed sympathy for a nurse who officials
say admitted she helped 30 elderly patients die, but he called
euthanasia ``a barbaric word.''
	   The health minister said he preferred better ``palliative
care,'' which he said was ``not developed enough in our country.''
He said a social security budget this fall should include funding
for ``palliative care teams.''
	   ``We need them because a third of our population will soon be in
retirement,'' the minister told RTL radio. ``We are all mortal, and
when the moment arrives, we should not be alone.''
	   The health minister criticized the practice of keeping patients
alive against their will, what he called ``therapeutic
perseverance'' for terminal patients by a medical profession that
``too often considers death as the failure of science.''
	   But he said the decision to take someone off life support should
be made by doctors as well as the patient and family.
	   ``To hasten death ... must be a collective decision, when the
decision becomes necessary,'' Kouchner said.
	   The debate over euthanasia in France rebounded after authorities
confirmed over the weekend that they suspended nurse Christine
Malevre and put her under formal investigation for murder -- one
step short of being charged.
	   Malevre, who worked at a hospital in Mantes-la-Jolie, a town
west of Paris, admitted she helped about 30 elderly terminal cancer
patients to die, often at the request of the patients' families,
authorities said.
	   Citing the investigation, officials declined to say how Malevre
helped the patients to die.

Some jobless foreign workers turning to crime in Singapore

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Some foreign workers who have lost their jobs
in Singapore's economic downturn are turning to crime to try to
survive on the streets, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   Extortion, gambling, vice and fraud are increasing in the
multi-ethnic island republic's Little India district, The Straits
Times said.
	   Affluent Singapore imports a significant portion of its work
force from abroad, taking advantage of cheaper labor from India,
Bangladesh and other neighbors.
	   Some 450,000 foreigners work at menial or hard labor, a shadow
community equaling about 15 percent of the city-state's population
of 3.1 million.
	   As the country's economy continues to slump, immigrants employed
as maids, construction and industrial workers are increasingly
finding themselves out of work.
	   Many spent life savings to come in the first place, and are
reluctant to return home to countries whose economies are suffering
even more than Singapore's.
	   ``If (the foreign workers) dare to run away from their work
sites and risk sleeping on the streets, they will dare to do
anything,'' security consultant S.R. Bala told the newspaper.
``Also, they feel they have nothing to lose.''
	   Extortion rackets in Little India abound, with foreign workers
threatening to report those who have overstayed their visas to the
police unless they pay a ``fee,'' the paper said.
	   Gambling is also rife in the area, with tables of dice or card
games set up in back allies. Illegal foreigners are also working as
guards for brothels and prostitutes.
	   There are even gangs operating stolen cellular phones for
foreign workers who want to make cheap calls home, the newspaper
added.
	   Police have made a series of high-profile raids as the number of
immigrants entering Singapore illegally grew and the number trying
to avoid deportation also increased.
	   The newspaper said Singapore police raided Little India 18 times
in the first half of this year in an effort to halt illegal
gambling, arresting 17 foreigners in the process.
	   They were among 21 people arrested in this year's first six
months in Little India, compared with nine arrests in the district
last year, the paper said.
	   In the past six weeks alone, police raids in the district netted
623 illegal immigrants and 75 foreigners with expired visas, the
newspaper added.
	   The Associated Press sought a response from police, but they did
not have an immediate comment on the report.

Paper: Fighting by pro-government factions displaces 70,000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Fighting between two pro-government
factions in southern Sudan has displaced tens of thousands of
civilians, a state-run newspaper reported Monday.
	   Clashes between the forces of Riak Machar, president of the
Southern Sudan States Coordination Council, and those of rival
Paulino Matep have displaced ``over 70,000 civilians, mostly women,
children and the elderly,'' Al-Anbaa daily said.
	   Most have fled from Unity Province to neighboring Kordufan
Province, the paper said.
	   The battles have left a ``huge number'' of soldiers and
civilians dead, according to a statement from Adam Taher Hamdoun,
President Omar el-Bashir's adviser on the south.
	   Casualty figures were not given. But in the town of Ler, where
the fiercest fighting took place, some 280 houses, 51 shops and
2,500 cattle compounds were destroyed, the paper said. Ler is 525
miles (840 kilometers) southwest of the capital, Khartoum.
	   Meanwhile, the rebel Sudan Peoples Liberation Army claimed its
forces were within 30 kilometers (18 miles) of oil fields in Bahr
al-Ghazal province. Army officials said, however, that the oil
fields were in no danger.
	   Sudan has been embroiled in a 15-year civil war in which
southern rebels are seeking autonomy for Christians and animists
from the Muslim north. An estimated 1.5 million people have died in
the fighting and accompanying famines.
	   The two sides recently signed a three-month cease-fire after the
international community asked that aid workers be given a chance to
distribute much needed food and medical aid to nearly 1.5 million
people in the south.
	   The latest fighting sending refugees fleeing into Kordufan
Province is between two former allies. Matep had joined in a peace
pact with the government, allying his forces with Machar's National
Salvation Front.
	   But early in the year, the two men got into a violent dispute
after Machar's candidate defeated Matep's to head Unity Province in
elections for governors of southern states held under the peace
accord.
	   The fighting has driven upwards of 5,000 civilians per day to
Kordufan, prompting officials there to demand that the federal
government intervene, said Al-Anbaa.

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Three nuns who worked with the late Mother
Teresa's Missionaries of Charity were shot to death Monday as they
left their clinic in the Red Sea city of Hodeida, a Yemeni security
official said.
	   The official said one of the Roman Catholic nuns was from the
Philippines and two were Indian.
	   They were killed by gunmen carrying automatic rifles, he said.
He spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.
	   Authorities have arrested one person believed to have been
involved in the attack, the official said. He did not identify the
suspect in any way.
	   The official said Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh promised
to direct the investigation into the incident.
	   The Missionaries of Charity, based in Calcutta, have operated
medical clinics in Yemen since 1970 and have never previously been
attacked, Yemeni officials said.
	   Large parts of Yemen are lawless, inhabited by tribes who do not
hesitate to kidnap foreigners or use firearms to settle scores with
rivals.
	   The incident is not believed related to the ongoing battles
between Yemeni tribesmen and the government over price hikes put in
place under an economic reform program supervised by the
International Monetary Fund.
	   Since the price increases went into effect June 19, tribesmen
have blown up oil pipelines, ambushed ministers' motorcades and
opened fire on government buildings.
	   The attack occurred at the end of a visit to the clinic for
patients with physical and mental disabilities, the official said.
	   The clinic is in Hodeida, which is 223 kilometers (138 miles)
west of the capital, San`a.
	   Indian and Italian ambassadors to Yemen demanded a thorough and
quick investigation.
	   Yemen's Health Minister Abdullah Abdul-Wali Nasher visited the
Hodeida branch of the Missionaries of Charity order to express the
government's concern.
	   The religious group was established by Mother Teresa, a Nobel
laureate who died last year.
	   Mother Teresa's successor, Sister Nirmala, was expected to fly
from Calcutta to visit the branch on Tuesday, the Yemeni security
official said.

4,5,6 &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-ASEAN-Myanmar &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ As Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi
spent a fourth day stuck in a car on a rural highway surrounded by
government security personnel, a Myanmar government spokesman
accused her Monday of colluding with Western embassies to put
pressure on the military regime.
	   Suu Kyi was stopped by local authorities Friday morning about 51
miles (32 miles) west of Yangon as she attempted to drive to
Bassein, 160 kilometers (100 miles) west of the capital, to meet
members of her political party, the National League for Democracy.
	   They refused to let her proceed and she has refused to return to
Yangon. She, a colleague and two drivers have spent three nights in
the car and were preparing to spend a fourth.
	   The NLD's central executive committee released a statement
Monday that said ``the health of the occupants of the car and Aung
San Suu Kyi are of grave concern.''
	   Although a military ambulance was stationed at the scene, the
NLD statement said that if Suu Kyi's health was affected, she would
take medical treatment only at home from her own doctors.
	   ``This is the wish of the NLD and general secretary Aung San Suu
Kyi,'' the NLD said.
	   A government officer said he believed she had enough food and
water to spend a week in the car. A government spokesman called the
episode a publicity stunt and said the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize
winner was being helped by Western embassies.
	   ``The NLD leadership has colluded with some Western embassies in
Yangon and has secured support and necessary assistance from them
once an incident has been deliberately created,'' the military
government said in a statement faxed to Bangkok.
	   ``Regretfully, the NLD has deliberately and obviously planned
this incident to coincide with the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting
currently in progress in Manila and also to induce participating
countries to berate the government of Myanmar for its own action,''
the statement said.
	   ASEAN is the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, whose
members are Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and _ since last year _ Laos and
Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   U.S. officials said Sunday that Myanmar's foreign minister was
receiving some tough talk from his ASEAN counterparts in Manila for
the regime's lack of progress on democratic and economic reforms.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, also in Manila to
attend a meeting of the ASEAN Regional Forum, warned Myanmar's
military government that the United States will hold it ``directly
responsible'' for Suu Kyi's health and welfare.
	   She said the situation in Myanmar had only worsened since it was
admitted to ASEAN.
	   ``With each passing day,'' she said, ``the likelihood of social
breakdown _ or explosion _ that would undermine regional stability
grows higher.''
	   Myanmar's military government came to power in 1988 after
violently crushing a nationwide democracy uprising. It ignored the
results of a 1990 election that Suu Kyi's party won by a landslide.
	   Suu Kyi has called on the military to allow the parliament
elected in that poll to convene by Aug. 21. The military has not
responded.

Justice Ministry employee fired for child porn possession

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Dutch child pornography scandal
widened Monday with revelations that a Justice Ministry employee
was fired for downloading thousands of Internet images, including
some of children being sexually abused.
	   The civil servant, whose name was not released, reportedly
collected and sold images _ including some of children as young as
age one being raped _ using computers at his home and office, the
daily De Telegraaf reported Monday.
	   Justice Ministry spokesman Wijnand Stevens confirmed that a
ministry employee had been fired for downloading pornography,
including child pornography. But Stevens denied that the man was a
top civil servant and that two other employees had been suspended
in connection with the case, as the newspaper had reported.
	   He also said there was no evidence that the man, who worked in
the Justice Ministry's information technology department, had been
peddling pornography for profit.
	   ``He collected a variety of pornography among which was child
pornography,'' Stevens said. He added that the suspect's computer
was linked to others in the department so colleagues could access
the images.
	   Liesbeth Horstink, spokeswoman for the public prosecutor's
office in The Hague, confirmed that an investigation was under way.
	   ``We are investigating a man on suspicion of possession of child
pornography,'' she said. She declined to give further details.
Possession of child pornography carries a maximum sentence of six
years' imprisonment in the Netherlands.
	   Police in The Hague were asked to investigate after a colleague
reported that the civil servant was downloading pornography,
Stevens said. The man was suspended during the investigation and
fired July 17 when police passed details of the case to the public
prosecutor in The Hague.
	   The news added to a deepening scandal that has gripped the
Netherlands since police announced two weeks ago that they had
discovered a huge stash of child pornography in an apartment in the
seaside town of Zandvoort.
	   The apartment is believed to have been the central point in a
worldwide ring of pedophiles who exchanged digital images of child
pornography via the Internet.
	   Police investigating the Zandvoort ring reportedly are trying to
establish whether the fired civil servant had any links to the
gang.

Fires scorch Mount Olympus; Dozens other fires burn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Firefighters struggled Monday to control a
forest fire scorching the slopes of Mount Olympus, the legendary
home of the ancient gods.
	   Meanwhile, dozens of other fires burned through brush and
woodlands around Greece in the most devastating season of blazes in
decades. No villages were in imminent danger in the latest fires.
	   Hundreds of hectares (thousands of acres) of forest have been
burned on Mount Olympus, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) northwest
of Athens, since blazes broke out late last week.
	   Two fire-fighting planes assisted crews on the ground on
Olympus.
	   Though wildfires are common during hot and dry summers in
Greece, this season has been called the most devastating in
decades. Four firefighters died last week battling a fire on the
outskirts of Athens.

Lebed says he may run for president if Russia's conditions worsen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Governor and former general Alexander Lebed once
again hinted at his presidential aspirations on Monday, saying he
would run if life in Russia doesn't improve, a news agency
reported.
	   Lebed would make a bid for president if ``the situation in the
country changes'' and the ``political and economic situation gets
worse,'' he said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Lebed has repeatedly said he would not run unless he solves the
problems of the vast Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia, where he was
elected governor in May. Many observers consider the governorship a
stepping stone to presidential elections in 2000.
	   He came in third in Russia's 1996 election for president.

Russia begins military exercises near Chechnya
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 11-16 with quotes from Maskhadov, details,
ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia launched military exercises in the Caucasus
region on Monday in an effort to stem increasing violence in its
restive southern republics of Chechnya and Dagestan, a news agency
reported.
	   The exercises follow President Boris Yeltsin's recent overtures
of support for Chechnya's government and his decision to have Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko resume negotiations with the president of
the secessionist republic this week.
	   The military maneuvers, which run until Friday, are designed to
tighten coordination between various forces to fight terrorist
attacks, free hostages, and combat smuggling _ exactly the sort of
incidents on the rise in Russia's fringe republics.
	   ``Measures aiming to maintain law and public order in the region
should be comprehensive and carried out according to a single
plan,'' said Russian Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin, according
to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Still, Stepashin said the exercises ``do not mean that somebody
is preparing for some massive combat action'' in the region.
	   Chechnya and Dagestan have been plagued recently by a rise in
kidnappings, killings, and theft. Maskhadov, who declared a state
of emergency in Chechnya last month, narrowly escaped a car bomb
last Thursday that killed two of his bodyguards.
	   Forces taking part in the exercises include the Interior
Ministry, the Border Guard Service, the Federal Security Service,
and troops stationed around Stavropol, 1,200 kilometers (750 miles)
south of Moscow.
	   Yeltsin has ordered Kiriyenko to meet this week with Maskhadov
to demonstrate support for his government, even though the Chechen
president led a 1994-96 war for independence from Russia that ended
in political deadlock.
	   ``The simple fact of this meeting is very important,'' Ivan
Rybkin, Russia's top negotiator with the Chechens, told the
Interfax news agency.
	   ``After a long break, negotiations between Moscow and Grozny
will occur at a high level. In that period, many bitter problems
have accumulated that can be destroyed only by the leaders of
Russia and Chechnya.''
	   A time and location for the talks has not been set.
	   Though Maskhadov said he favored new negotiations, he blamed
Russia for Chechnya's present situation.
	   The republic's problems ``directly stem from the war and the
actions by Russia to seal off the republic and create conditions
making a social explosion inescapable.''
	   Maskhadov also ruled out any compromise on the republic's
independence, repeating that Chechnya would never sign a document
``which might limit Chechnya's independence even by one percent,''
he told the Interfax news agency.
	   A total of six people have been arrested so far in connection
with the car bomb attack on Maskhadov, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said.

Court set to rule on McLaren appeal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The International Court of Appeal will announce
Tuesday its ruling on McLaren's appeal against Michael Schumacher's
victory at the British Grand Prix, officials said.
	   The July 12 Grand Prix ended in bizarre circumstances, when
Schumacher's Ferrari, leading by more than 20 seconds, crossed the
finish line driving down the pit lane rather than on the track.
	   McLaren, for whom Mika Hakkinen came in second, protested, but
lost. They then appealed.
	   The sport's governing body, FIA, announced the date of the final
ruling in a statement released Monday.

Ericsson's pretax profits up, but markets disappointed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Telecommunications giant LM Ericsson AB
on Monday reported a half-year pretax profit of 7.57 billion kronor
(dlrs 952 million), a 25-percent increase from the same period a
year ago.
	   Despite the rise, and despite the profit being slightly higher
than expected, Ericsson's shares fell 7.4 percent on the Stockholm
bourse after the report because its figures revealed disappointing
mobile phone sales for the second quarter of the year.
	   In the second quarter, its mobile phones sales were almost flat
at 10.83 billion kronor (dlrs 1.36 billion), compared with 10.76
billion kronor a year ago. In contrast, Ericsson's Finnish rival
Nokia last week announced a 50-percent second-quarter increase in
mobile phone sales.
	   Ericsson's chief executive, Sven-Christer Nilsson, also said he
foresees a continued strong downward pressure on the group's
products, especially on terminals, but for the first half margins
were better than last year.
	   Sales of cellular systems grew 20 percent in the first half
while the Infocom business area reported a 4 percent sales gain,
but the Asian economic crisis significantly hurt demand, the
company said.
	   Sales to Asia excluding China has dropped by 27 percent in the
first half compared with 1997 which means lost sales of between 4
to 5 billion kronor (dlrs 500 to 625 million), Ericsson said.

United States beats Czechs 10-0 in eighth straight shutout
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FUJINOMIYA, Japan (AP) _ Sheila Douty hit a three-run home run
in the first inning Monday and the United States went on to a 10-0
victory over the Czech Republic, its eighth straight shutout in the
Women's World Softball Championship.
	   The American team finished atop the Group One standings in the
preliminary round.
	   Canada finished second with a 6-2 record by beating Colombia
3-0. South Africa defeated Denmark 2-0 in the last preliminary
round game.
	   When the final round starts Tuesday, the United States meets
Japan, Italy plays Venezuela, Australia faces Canada and China
meets Taiwan.
	   In a game called after five innings because of the lopsided
score, Americans Lori Harrigan and Christa Williams combined to
hold the Czechs to one hit.
	   Canada's Lori Sippel held Colombia to two hits, and Denise
Carriere ignited a three-run second inning with a double.
	   For South Africa, Susan Solomon singled home the first run and
N.S. Engelbrechit added a one-run single in the third inning.
	   Behind Canada in Group One, Italy placed third in the
preliminary round, also with a 6-2 record but with a loss to
Canada.
	   They were followed by Taiwan at 5-3, the Netherlands at 4-4, the
Czech Republic and Colombia at 3-5, South Africa at 1-7 and Denmark
at 0-8.
	   In Group Two, Australia placed first with 7-0, followed by Japan
at 6-1, China at 5-2, Venezuela, the Netherlands Antilles and New
Zealand at 3-4, South Korea at 1-6 and the Philippines at 0-7.
	   Venezuela placed fourth based on a victory over the Netherlands
Antilles, and New Zealand was sixth based on runs against.
	   The tournament's top four teams other than Australia qualify for
the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.
	   Australia qualifies automatically as the Olympic host nation.
The other three berths will be one each from the U.S.-Caribbean,
Asia-Oceania and Africa-European zones.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two American and two Russian women pilots took off
from a Moscow airfield Monday on a flight to Russia's Far East
designed to commemorate a landmark flight in Soviet aviation.
	   Nikki Mitchell, one of the American pilots, said the journey is
designed to strengthen Russian-American ties after the fall of the
Soviet Union.
	   In 1938, three Soviet pilots broke the world record for women
aviators for traveling the longest distance non-stop. The
achievement earned them a top Soviet medal, the Gold Star.
	   The commemorate team will fly in Russian-American pairs,
stopping in a number of cities along their route. Two will pilot a
U.S.-made Maule M-5, and the other two will fly a Russian
Antonov-2.
	   When the pilots reach the town of Paulina Osipenko, named after
one of the original three Soviet pilots, the Russians will return
to Moscow and the Americans will complete an around-the-world trip
back to their home in Nashville, Tennessee.
	   The other pilots on the commemorative journey are American
Rhonda Miles, and Russians Khalide Makagonova and Natalia
Vinokorova.

Appointment of ex-KGB agent to strengthen Russian security service
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 15-16 with political analyst suggesting
appointment linked to presidential elections. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ When President Boris Yeltsin was dismantling the
Soviet system, one of his first moves was to disband the KGB. Now
that Russia is awash with new problems, Yeltsin is looking to the
former KGB for help.
	   Yeltsin appointed former KGB spy Vladimir Putin as head of
Russia's Federal Security Service over the weekend, a move designed
to augment the power of the KGB's main successor agency, Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said Monday.
	   The move is aimed at ``strengthening and fortifying the service,
as well as returning some of its unfairly lost authority,''
Kiriyenko said.
	   When the KGB was split into several services following the 1991
Soviet collapse, the Federal Security Service became its main
successor, but with less influence and power.
	   However, Yeltsin has recently been moving the other direction,
expanding the FSB's clout and tapping into the KGB's experience of
imposing control and gathering information.
	   Earlier this year, Yeltsin brought Russia's border guards under
the control of the FSB, giving it a broader mandate in dealing with
issues involving counter-intelligence and domestic security.
	   Then the president appointed three former KGB agents to key jobs
in his administration that deal with Russia's far-flung regions,
where maverick local leaders have caused headaches for the Kremlin.
	   Putin was one of those agents, and until his appointment this
weekend he was first deputy chief of staff in charge of relations
with Russia's regions.
	   Now, with the new promotion of the 45-year-old former spy, the
FSB could be regaining some of the power that one belonged to its
predecessor agency.
	   ``The choice of Vladimir Putin for the post is not accidental,''
Kiriyenko told the FSB's staff as he introduced the new boss on
Monday.
	   As a former intelligence officer stationed in Germany, Putin is
familiar with the whole spectrum of FSB work, and is also an expert
on economic and regional issues, Kiriyenko was quoted as saying by
the ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agencies.
	   Regional officials have been blamed for misspending federal
funds allocated to the regions _ thereby contributing to the
chronic problem of unpaid wages and pensions that touched off
recent strikes and protests.
	   Putin's priorities as FSB chief will be combating economic
espionage and illegal capital flight, Kiriyenko said.
	   Kiriyenko denied speculation that Putin's predecessor, Nikolai
Kovalyov, was dismissed in response to his handling of several
recent incidents, including a spy dispute with South Korea.
	   One analyst suggested the appointment may reflect Yeltsin's
concerns about upcoming presidential elections.
	   ``I think the main reason ... was that they needed a man who
would control the FSB on the eve of the 2000 elections,'' said Igor
Bunin of the Center for Political Technologies, an independent
Russian think-tank.
	   And at least one politician called Putin's appointment
ill-considered.
	   Kovalyov ``was a professional, knowledgeable, reasonable
person,'' said Viktor Ilyukhin, a leading Communist lawmaker and
staunch Yeltsin opponent. ``I'm afraid Putin does not have these
qualities. He still needs to gather political experience.''

Hong Kong Telcom lays off 270 managers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from union and company representatives
in grafs 4-9; UPDATES closing stock price in graf 13 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong Telecommunications, one of the
territory's largest employers, laid off 270 managers Monday, adding
to Hong Kong's jobless toll.
	   A company statement said the layoffs were ``part of an overall
program to reshape business and enhance productivity.''
	   They were necessary in an ``increasingly competitive market
environment and ahead of further liberalization in the
telecommunications market next year,'' it said.
	   Earlier this year, the company surrendered its monopoly on
international phone calls in exchange for a government payment of
U.S. dlrs 858 million.
	   Ip Kwok-fun, chairman of the Hong Kong Telecom Staff
Association, said the 270 managers, including section managers and
professionals, had agreed to leave in exchange for buyouts. The
company statement said it paid the workers 100 million Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 12.8 million).
	   Ip said the company has been downsizing through natural
attrition for several months. He also said that in a meeting Monday
with union representatives, the company denied rumors that it
planned to cut its work force by 1,000 through early retirement or
voluntary resignations.
	   Company spokesman Louis Liu said there are no immediate plans
for more layoffs.
	   But Ip said junior employees are worried that they may lose
their jobs if business does not pick up soon.
	   ``The company's excuse is to control cost. If the economic
situation doesn't improve, and if profits from IDD (international
direct-dialing) and business lines do not pick up, they may have to
lay off more general and supporting staff,'' Ip said.
	   Hong Kong's Labor Department has set up a hot line for the
workers.
	   Analysts said the news was not entirely unexpected as the
company faces a slowdown due to the Asian economic crisis.
	   ``There is still a lot of concern about the slowdown in IDD
traffic for the company,'' said Marvin Lo, an analyst at Amsteel
Securities Ltd.
	   Hong Kong Telcom shares closed down 2.73 percent at 14.25 Hong
Kong dollars (U.S dlrs 1.83).
	   The government announced last week that unemployment had hit a
15-year high of 4.5 percent.

Dutch justice employee fired for child porn possession
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Dutch child pornography scandal
widened Monday with revelations that a Justice Ministry employee
was fired for collecting computer images of children being raped.
	   Justice Ministry spokesman Wijnand Stevens confirmed that an
employee in the ministry's information technology department had
been fired for taking pornographic images from the Internet onto
home and office computers.
	   ``He collected a variety of pornography among which was child
pornography,'' Stevens said. He added that the suspect's computer
was linked to others in the department so colleagues could access
the images.
	   Dutch police two weeks said they had discovered a huge stash of
child pornography in an apartment in the seaside town of Zandvoort,
which is believed to be the hub of a worldwide ring of pedophiles
who exchanged digital images of child pornography via the Internet.
	   Police investigating the Zandvoort ring reportedly are trying to
establish whether the fired civil servant had any links to the
gang.
	   The civil servant, whose name was not released, reportedly sold
some of the images _ including some of children as young as age one
being sexually abused, the daily De Telegraaf reported Monday.
	   But Stevens said there was no evidence that the man peddled
pornography for profit.
	   Police in The Hague were asked to investigate after a colleague
reported that the civil servant was downloading pornography,
Stevens said. The man was suspended during the investigation and
fired July 17 when police passed details of the case to the public
prosecutor in The Hague, which is now investigating.
	   Possession of child pornography carries a maximum sentence of
six years' imprisonment in the Netherlands.

Eight elephants found dead in southwestern China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Eight elephants have been found dead in a nature
reserve in southwestern China, presumably killed in a lightning
storm, the official Beijing Evening News reported Monday.
	   After hearing reports by local farmers, game wardens found the
elephants' bodies July 15 on a hill inside the Xishuangbanna
reserve, near China's border with Myanmar, the newspaper said.
	   Six of the bodies were under a fallen tree while two other
elephant carcasses were found nearby. After autopsies on
``specimens'' proved inconclusive, investigators returned to the
site and noticed seared streaks from lightning on the tree, the
newspaper said.
	   Before the nature reserve was set up in tropical forests of
Xishuangbanna in the 1980s, once-thriving elephant herds had
dwindled to 197 head. Locals hunted the elephants to keep them from
damaging farmland and for their precious tusks.
	   Recent accounts in state-run media now put the herd at 250
inside the 240,000 hectares (590,000 acres).

Minister sets out moderate agenda, risks wrath of hard-liners

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ On his first day at work Monday, Iran's new
interior minister promised to pursue moderate policies that protect
freedom of speech and the rights of individuals.
	   The pledge by Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari to work for the political
and social reforms of President Mohammad Khatami risks
confrontation with Islamic hard-liners, who impeached his
predecessor for being too liberal.
	   Hard-liners fired the first shot in a new battle over the powers
of the Interior Ministry on Sunday by sending out vice police, who
harassed or arrested anyone found violating strict Islamic rules
that had been relaxed after Khatami took over last August.
	   Police set up roadblocks in several parts of the capital and
arrested young men cruising for dates. They also stopped women who
were not completely covered according to the Islamic dress code.
	   ``Three Islamic judges issued sentences on the spot for men who
were found harassing women,'' said Brig. Gen. Hedayat Lotfian, head
of the Disciplinary Forces that also act as the vice police.
	   Khatami's moderate faction has been locked in a power struggle
with Islamic hard-liners, who have been in power for nearly 20
years and have stalled his efforts to allow more political freedoms
and ease Islamic rules.
	   Lari told officials and reporters at the Interior Ministry that
he would work for reforms promised by Khatami.
	   ``Freedom is not something granted by the government or its
officials,'' he said in an attack on the hard-liners. ``It is a
right, and the government's job is only to make sure no one harms
that right.''
	   He also lashed out at the hard-liners for wanting a monopoly on
power.
	   ``We can't grant permission to political parties and then close
them down if their views are different from ours,'' Lari said.
	   He added: ``It is no art to allow only those to speak who agree
with us. The art is in allowing those who are against us to speak
as well.''
	   Lari wore the long robes of a cleric and the black turban that
signifies his descent from Islam's Prophet Mohammed.
	   After the 1979 revolution that ousted the U.S.-supported shah,
democracy and freedom were shunned as Western concepts in Iran. But
they have become the buzzwords of Iranian politics since Khatami
won a landslide victory in the May 1997 election.
	   His 20 million votes were seen as a protest against the
hard-liners and as a mandate for reform. But Khatami has been
bogged down by the power struggle with the hard-liners.
	   In what was seen as a settling of scores, a hard-line court last
week sentenced a key Khatami ally, Tehran Mayor Gholamhossein
Karbaschi, to five years in jail for corruption. Karbaschi ran
Khatami's election campaign.
	   Last month, hard-liners impeached Abdollah Nouri as interior
minister for allowing political gatherings and relaxing Islamic
rules. They have threatened to do the same to Lari.
	   In introducing his successor on Monday, Nouri implied Lari and
Khatami were ready for the fight.
	   ``There were some who believed that the president should step
back from his election promises, and to make a deal over them,''
Nouri said. ``But he didn't do so, and has chosen one of the best
people who believe in his political vision.''
	   Khatami's powers are limited. The real power is in the hands of
the hard-line clergy led by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. As supreme
leader, he controls the armed forces, the judiciary, the
intelligence services and the broadcast network.
	   Normally, the interior minister is given control of the security
forces. But Khamenei has withheld transferring authority for the
vice police in an effort to stall Khatami's liberalization.

Continental tire to buy ITT Automotive's brake and chassis unit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ German Continental AG, the world's
fourth-largest tiremaker, said Monday it will acquire U.S. ITT
Automotive's brake and chassis unit for dlrs 1.9 billion, subject
to anti-trust approval.
	   The move will allow Continental to step up its presence outside
of Europe and in North America, the tiremaker said.
	   To finance the acquisition, Continental plans to raise 20
percent, or dlrs 38 million, of the transaction value in a capital
increase, the company said.
	   In addition, Continental will issue a convertible bond, or take
out a long-term loan, to finance 60 percent of the deal, it said.
The remaining 20 percent will be paid out of the company's cash
reserves, Continental said.
	   ITT Automotive B-and-C, which is based in Frankfurt, has annual
sales of 3.8 billion marks (dlrs 2.1 billion), about two-thirds of
which are in Europe and 25 percent in North America.
	   ``It is our declared goal to strengthen the ITT B-and-C's
earnings. The technological and commercial potential is there; we
are simply tapping them,'' Continental Chairman Hubertus von
Gruenberg said.

Brown: Drugs rife in distance running
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Leading British distance runner Jon Brown says use
of the banned drug EPO is as ``rife'' in his sport as it is in
cycling.
	   The 1996 European cross country champion said EPO was endemic
among European runners competing in distances from 5,000 meters to
the marathon. However, he said he didn't ``suspect'' athletes from
east Africa who have lowered distant records in recent years.
	   ``Two years ago (the use of EPO) was virtually non-existent in
distance running but I think now you have got some main players
operating on the stuff,'' Brown was quoted as saying in the Times
newspaper Monday.
	   Brown made the allegations amid the drug scandal which has
marred the Tour de France, forcing the achievements of cyclists to
take a backseat to the alleged widespread use of EPO in the sport.
	   EPO is a performance-enhancing substance which increases the
oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood by increasing the level of
red blood cells. It is most beneficial to endurance athletes.
	   ``It is mainly the European athletes from countries with a
background in cycling. The same people are supplying the cyclists
and the distance runners,'' Brown told the Independent newspaper.
	   ``Once you go down that road _ the same as cycling _ sport is
not real sport and the barriers are unlimited,'' he said.
	   ``It's going to be like the Tour (Tour de France), where people
think if you don't take the stuff, you're not going to come
first.''
	   ``In cycling it is team policy and, if you do not do it, you
have got no chance. I would not like to see distance running go
that way.''
	   After gaining British selection for the European championships
starting in Budapest on Aug. 18, the 27-year-old athlete said his
main goal was to beat the cheats.
	   ``I feel like I have seen a lot of weird stuff over the last 18
months or so,'' he told the Times. ``Soon there is going to be no
way anybody is going to beat these characters without playing their
game.''

Use economic crisis to fix traffic, agency tells Thai government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai traffic-management agency has
urged the government to take advantage of the country's economic
crisis to fix Bangkok's notorious traffic problems once and for
all.
	   Yongyuth Sarasombat, secretary-general of the Office of the
Commission for the Management of Road Traffic, said the economic
meltdown has been a blessing by causing a drastic drop in the
number of cars on Bangkok's roads, the newspaper The Nation
reported Monday.
	   Now is the perfect time for the government to adopt a
comprehensive plan that will decrease the need for people to
commute long distances each day in cars, he added.
	   He did not, however, offer any suggestions or details as to what
measures such a plan might contain. Thai car owners have vigorously
resisted any bans on using their vehicles in the city.
	   Bangkok's traffic jams are legendary. In 1996, an average of
more than 700 new cars a day hit Bangkok's streets. The city had as
many cars as New York or Paris but only one-third as many roads.
Even short trips took hours.
	   But since an economic crisis hit Thailand in July 1997, car
sales have plummeted and some of those already sold have been
repossessed from buyers who can no longer pay for them.
	   ``The plunge of new car sales has contributed significantly to
the success of our traffic management plans. This helps speeding up
traffic flow during the rush hours,'' Yongyuth said.

Oracle to give millions to computer projects in Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The international software giant Oracle will
give several million dollars to educational computer and Internet
projects for Israelis and Palestinians, a company official said
Monday.
	   The first project, scheduled to be completed by fall, involves
installing computer networks with Internet access in classrooms and
homes in Ariel, Israel's largest West Bank settlement, said Oracle
Israel's marketing manager Natan Gavish.
	   The project is jointly funded by Oracle and the Israeli
government.
	   Gavish said Oracle hooked up with Ariel after Ariel mayor Ron
Nahman met former junk bond king Michael Milken, who is active in
raising money for educational projects.
	   Oracle also plans to set up Internet centers at community
centers in low-income Israeli towns and to establish computer
training centers for Israelis and Palestinians, Gavish said.
	   Gavish declined to specify how much money Oracle, which is
headquartered in Redwood Shores, Calif., is investing in the
projects.

Atherton and Hussain take England close to victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Fighting half centuries by Mike
Atherton and Nasser Hussain on Monday have England tantalizingly
poised to win the fourth cricket test against South Africa.
	   England was 190 for one at lunch on the last day of the Trent
Bridge test, needing 57 runs to win the match and level the series
1-1 with one test to play at Headingly next week.
	   England started its second innings Sunday needing 247 to win and
resumed Monday at 108 for one _ still 139 in arrears.
	   Outclassed and outplayed by the visiting South African's in the
second and third tests, England is now almost certain to score a
morale-boosting victory.
	   In a test marred by umpiring controversies, mostly against the
South Africans, England's remarkable fight back after conceding a
38-run first innings lead has been completely overshadowed.
	   England's victory charge has been largely set up by a gutsy
innings by former captain Atherton, 87 not out, batting superbly
with great composure in his five-hours at the crease. He has hit 14
boundaries off 244 balls.
	   Atherton, playing his 50th home test, weathered a furious stint
of bowling from Allan Donald on Sunday after New Zealand umpire
Steve Dunn turned down a confident appeal from South Africa for a
caught behind.
	   But Donald failed to intimidate Atherton, who returned to the
wicket Monday in a confident frame of mind.
	   Atherton and Hussain, 57 not out at the break, continued to
frustrate the South Africans, who struggled for a breakthrough on
the final morning.
	   The pair got off to a positive start, 20 runs coming in a
run-a-minute effort as Atherton reached his second half century of
the match.
	   Atherton, who hit 58 in the England first innings, hit
successive fours off Shaun Pollock to reach his 37th half century
in 198 minutes.
	   Pollock struggled for rhythm in his first four overs and
conceded 17 runs, but a change of ends soon had him beating
Atherton and Hussain with big leg cutters under overcast
conditions.
	   The second wicket pair brought up the 100-run stand in 164
minutes as the first hour of play realized 38 runs in 15 overs.
	   South African captain Hansie Cronje switched his bowlers around
in desperate search of a breakthrough but a breakthrough was not
forthcoming.
	   Only once before had England scored more than 240 runs to win a
test at home and that was in 1902, when it scored 262 in the final
innings to beat Australia by one wicket at the Oval.
	   Earlier it was Angus Fraser's bowling which led a remarkable
England fight back, the fast bowler taking his second five-wicket
haul for the match.
	   Fraser followed up his 5-60 in the first innings with 5-60 for a
10-wicket haul, his second this year since his 11-110 against the
West Indies at Port-of-Spain in February.
	   Apart from a handful of decision that had gone against the South
Africans, soft dismissals in the second innings contributed to a
paltry 208 which set a gettable target for the English.

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ A network of seismological devices
will be installed along Papua New Guinea's north coast in an effort
to provide early warning of future tsunamis, the Australian
government said Monday.
	   Australian scientists will travel to Papua New Guinea Tuesday to
begin work with an international team of seismologists trying to
understand the cause of this month's disaster, Resources Minister
Warwick Parer said.
	   ``The seismologists will be assisting the Papua New Guinea
Geological Survey to install a network of seismographs at Wewak,
Aitape, Vanimo and at Nuku, south of Aitape,'' Parer said.
	   ``These will be used to locate aftershocks which will highlight
the source region of the magnitude 7 earthquake that triggered the
destructive tsunami.''
	   A tsunami believed to have been caused by an offshore earthquake
struck the northwest coast of Papua New Guinea on July 17,
destroying villages, killing 2,000 people and leaving thousands
more homeless.
	   Australian Geological Survey Organization seismologists Kevin
McCue and Malcolm Somerville will be the first seismologists to
visit the area since the disaster.
	   Parer said the scientists would use information from the network
to try to protect the people of Papua New Guinea from a repeat of
the tragedy.
	   ``Seismologists will be able to estimate the warning time
between the occurrence of an earthquake and any resulting tsunami
hitting the coastline,'' Parer said.
	   ``This work will contribute to planning guidelines for
rehabilitation of this region and other vulnerable coastal
communities.''
	   It is unclear how well the warning system will work, as victims
of the tsunami who felt the earthquake said the wave hit the coast
within minutes and there was no time to escape.

Pop singer Michael Jackson to build theme parks and toy stores in

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Pop star Michael Jackson announced Monday that he
will team up with a Japanese company to build three sprawling theme
parks _ with golf courses and hotels attached _ and a new chain of
toy stores in Japan and in other countries.
	   The joint venture _ Michael Jackson Japan Co. Ltd. _ is still in
the process of selecting locations for the three parks, two of
which will be built in Japan and one overseas. Prosperity
Enterprise Corp. is Jackson's Japanese partner.
	   ``This is going to be one of a kind,'' Jackson told reporters in
Tokyo.
	   The company also plans to open ``Wonder World of Toys'' stores
across Japan and overseas, with the first store expected to open in
Japan followed by a second one in Guam by March 1999.
	   ``Michael himself will choose the toys,'' said Kanji Ishizumi,
legal adviser to the company.
	   Prosperity Enterprise, a consortium of small businesses in
Japan, provided the 500 million yen (dlrs 3.6 million) in startup
money for the new company, and Jackson is offering the use of his
name. Officials said Monday he is expected to make additional
investments.
	   Jackson will also be involved in designing the concepts and
producing the theme parks and toy stores. MJ Japan expects to
generate 200 billion yen (dlrs 1.42 billion) in sales from the
theme parks and toy stores over the next five years.
	   Jackson has said he wants to build similar theme parks in Poland
and Brazil.

Lebed says he may run for president if Russia's conditions worsen

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Lebed comments on cabinet shuffles in grafs 5-6. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Governor and former general Alexander Lebed once
again hinted at his presidential aspirations on Monday, saying he
would run if life in Russia doesn't improve, a news agency
reported.
	   Lebed would make a bid for president if ``the situation in the
country changes'' and the ``political and economic situation gets
worse,'' he said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Lebed has repeatedly said he would not run unless he solves the
problems of the vast Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia, where he was
elected governor in May. Many observers consider the governorship a
stepping stone to presidential elections in 2000.
	   But Lebed has repeatedly made statements that seem to probe the
presidential waters, and also Monday made veiled attacks on
President Boris Yeltsin for the leader's frequent Cabinet shuffles.
	   ``One must think when appointing people, and once they have been
appointed they must be given an opportunity to work,'' he told
ITAR-Tass.
	   Yeltin's latest shuffle was Saturday, when he replaced the head

Thai agro giant selling non-core businesses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Charoen Pokphand Group, one of the
largest conglomerates in Thailand, will sell off its non-core
businesses to concentrate on agroindustry, telecommunications and
convenience stores, its chairman says.
	   With an economic downturn rolling across Asia, and the
conglomerate saddled with debts worth dlrs 1.2 billion, CP Chairman
Dhanin Chearavanont has said he intends to sell many of his group's
ancillary enterprises and put the money into his main businesses,
his spokesman said Monday.
	   About dlrs 800 million of the group's debt is owed by Telecom
Asia, a phone company that has a concession for fixed lines in
Bangkok.
	   Until the economic crisis hit in 1997, CP was aggressively
expanding many of its non-core operations.
	   CP, which is the largest foreign private investor in China, also
has interests in the retail, automotive, real estate and
petrochemical industries, among others.
	   Gauging exactly how large CP Group is, or its total value, is
difficult because few of its companies are listed on stock
exchanges.
	   The company was started as a Bangkok seed store in the 1920s by
Dhanin's grandfather, who emigrated from China. By the 1970s, it
was running feed mills and chicken farms across the country.
	   It entered China in 1979, and now runs diversified businesses in
that country.
	   The group's rapid expansion was funded, however, by
foreign-denominated loans, and as Asian economies slowed last year,
and the Thai currency fell against the dollar, CP began to suffer.
	   Dhanin said he is looking to sell stakes in some of his retail
outlets, such as Lotus Supercenters or Sunny's Supermarkets.
	   ``We don't mind having foreign investors controlling our
companies, but they have to be under the country's laws and bring
in capital, smart people, technology and markets,'' Dhanin said,
according to his spokesman.
	   He said he supports a merger between Big C stores and Lotus
Supercenters, in which his company holds minority stakes. Both are
strapped for cash, analysts say, and a merger might prompt other
partners to inject more cash into the operations.
	   Dhanin is determined to hang on to the company's management of
7-Eleven convenience stores, his spokesman said. CP operates more
than 1,000 7-Elevens across Thailand.

Peacekeepers' vehicle blown up by mine in Abkhazia

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ A land mine blew up an armored personnel
carrier in Georgia's breakaway province of Abkhazia on Monday,
injuring several Russian peacekeepers, officials said.
	   The Abkhazian Deputy Interior Minister Konstantin Adleiba said
two peacekeepers were killed and three injured in the blast in the
Ghali region, but the peacekeepers' command only said that three
servicemen were injured, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Adleiba blamed the attack on pro-Georgian militia groups
operating in the region, which is Abkhazia's usual explanation for
such attacks.
	   But members of a prominent pro-Georgia militia, the White
Legion, denied responsibility for the explosion. The group does not
mine roads in the region where the blast occurred, said White
Legion commander Zurab Samushia, according to Interfax.
	   Bondo Dzhikiya, Georgia's presidential representative to the
regions bordering the separatist province, blamed Abkhazian
separatists and peacekeepers for failing to ensure order in the
volatile region.
	   ``The zone is controlled by Abkhazians and peacekeepers,''
Dzhikiya said. ``It is they who should care about safety in the
zone.''
	   Georgian officials have repeatedly accused Russian peacekeepers
of being too soft on separatists.
	   ``I am not going to accuse everyone now _ as Abkhazians do _ for
planting the mine,'' Dzhikiya said. ``Let them investigate first.
But in my opinion such provocations are staged to aggravate the
situation on the eve of the U.N. Security Council session on
Abkhazia.''
	   Last week, nine Russian peacekeepers were killed when their
truck was blown up by a radio-activated mine in Abkhazia. On July
11, five more soldiers were killed in a similar incident.
	   The peacekeepers were sent to stabilize the Black Sea province
of Abkhazia in 1994 following a war between Georgian government
troops and Abkhazian separatists. Large-scale fighting has ended,
but sporadic clashes have continued, despite the peacekeepers'
presence.

<TEXT>
	   BAHRAIN (AP) _ Kuwait is planning to start year negotiations
with foreign oil companies by year's end for the development of
five fields near the border with Iraq, the Middle East Economic
Survey reported Monday.
	   Although Kuwait has been considering such a foreign role for two
years, the appointment of a new oil minister, Sheik Saud al-Sabah,
has put talks on a faster track, MEES said. Sheik Saud, appointed
in March, was Kuwait's ambassador to Washington during the 1990-91
Gulf Crisis.
	   The minister is ``actively engaged and personally committed to
move the process forward as soon as possible,'' MEES reported. It
said a number of representatives of foreign companies visited
Kuwait recently to present their ideas on meeting the country's
objectives.
	   Kuwait wants to work with foreign companies through operation
service agreements and not production sharing contracts, which are
forbidden by its constitution.
	   Kuwait now pumps 1.98 million barrels of oil a day.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's dinar weakened against the U.S.
dollar Monday in response to increased government spending, Baghdad
traders said.
	   The dinar has slumped to 1,650 to the dollar from 1,600 over the
weekend.
	   The decline, traders said, is mainly attributed to a government
decision to raise salaries of teachers, members of the security
forces and army officers by at least 100 per cent. It will also
give bonuses to some employees.
	   The raise is the first since 1995 when the government launched
an austerity program to shore up the currency.
	   The monthly salary of a civil servant in Iraq prior to the
latest raise was about 5,000 dinars. Army officers salaries are in
the range of 25,000 dinars per month.
	   Baghdad newspapers said this month the Central Bank will
distribute 55 billion Iraqi dinars to around five million
government employees.
	   Also this summer the government paid up to 375 billion dinars in
a rescue package to save wheat and barely growers from crippling
losses.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Public Sector Minister Atef Obeid on Monday
reaffirmed his country's commitment to privatizing 200 companies by
the end of the year 2000.
	   Obeid said that 100 companies are ready to be privatized over
the next year, while 100 more will be sold by the end of the year
2000.
	   The companies will be sold either to anchor investors or through
the stock market, he told Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
	   Egypt has either fully or partially privatized nearly 84
companies since 1993 when the government's ambitious structural
adjustment and economic reform program gained steam. It had pledged
to privatize 314 companies.
	   Privatization revenues for the period between January 1996 and
June 1997 amounted to dlrs 1.5 billion, about 40 percent of which
was used to pay bank debts.
	   The International Monetary Fund, in a May report comparing
growth rates in 39 countries, said Egypt's reform and privatization
program helped it secure the No. 4 slot. Egypt's growth rate stands
at about 2 percent of its gross domestic product.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The General Authority for Investment said
Monday it has approved the establishment of a new Egyptian company
for oil refining and processing with an issued capital of 1.02
billion pounds (dlrs 300 million).
	   An authority statement said investments expected to be carried
out by the company would amount to 2.39 billion Egyptian pounds
(dlrs 703 million).
	   Misr Oil Processing Company, based in the city of Suez 130
kilometers (80 miles) east of Cairo, was established by several
Egyptian banks and firms with public participation, it said.
 &UR; ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The Gulf Bank announced Monday it has made 16
million dinars (dlrs 52.5 million) in net profit in the first half
of the year, down 12.75 percent from the corresponding period in
1997.
	   An advertisement in Al-Qabas daily said 1997's midyear net
profits of 18.4 million dinars (dlrs 60.2 million) included
non-operational returns of 2.7 million dinars (dlrs 8.8 million).
	   The results were achieved through ``maintaining the high quality
of the bank's assets and the fine management of its assets and
liabilities,'' the ad said.
	   The bank's assets on June 30 were 1.8 billion dinars (dlrs 5.9
billion). They were 1.6 billion dinars (dlrs 5.2 billion) end of
June 1997.
	   Gulf Bank is listed on the Kuwait Stock Exchange with a paid-up
capital of 82 million dinars (dlrs 268.2 million).
 &UR; ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The joint Jordanian-Syrian Land Transport
Company earned 4 million Jordanian dinars (dlrs 5.6 million) in
revenues in the first six months of this year, Hamdi Habashneh, the
company's director general, said Monday.
	   The company, owned equally by Jordan and Syria, has gradually
raised its paidup capital to 8 million dinars (dlrs 11.3 million)
in 1998, from 7 million dinars (dlrs 9.8 million) two years ago,
Habashneh said.
	   He noted that the company, established in 1975, runs a fleet of
412 trucks and trailers, has 786 employees. It had total revenues
last year of 8.8 million dinars (dlrs 12.4 million), while
expenditures including taxes and reserves amounted to 6.9 million
dinars (dlrs 9.7 million), he said.
 &UR; ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Tourism from Arab Gulf countries to Jordan
increased by 20 percent this year over the same period in 1997,
Tourism Ministry officials said Monday.
	   According to Tourism Minister Aqel Biltagi, the number of
tourists arriving in Jordan from the Gulf states in the first five
months of 1998 increased by 20 percent from 164,000 in that period
last year.
	   The minister said 28 percent of the increase consisted of
tourists coming from Kuwait, a much higher percentage than in past
years.
	   He attributed the increase to steps taken to attract a larger
numbers of Arab Gulf tourists, especially dropping requirements for
visas and for crossing the border in cars.

Security chief becomes first leader to resign since handover
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's security chief resigned Monday,
becoming the first senior official to leave the government since
the territory's handover to China last year.
	   Secretary for Security Peter Lai, who joined the government 25
years ago, told reporters he was leaving for ``personal reasons''
to join his family in Australia.
	   Lai, 47, was promoted in 1995 to security secretary, the
official in charge of the police, immigration and customs services.
	   He held the post of deputy constitutional affairs secretary
under the last British governor, Chris Patten, and was a key figure
in pushing Patten's democratic reforms.
	   The reforms angered China, which eventually dismantled the
legislature elected under them.
	   But to ensure a stable handover, Beijing allowed all senior
officials to keep their posts. Under the post-handover
constitution, Beijing officially appoints all principal officials
on the Hong Kong government's recommendation.
	   The government announced that Director of Immigration Regina Ip,
also a career civil servant, will succeed Lai on Aug. 31.
	   A handful of career civil servants and a group of appointed
advisers are largely responsible for making government policies,
while the partially elected legislature acts mainly as an advisory
body to monitor the government.

China demands U.S. congress respect claim to Taiwan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China demanded Monday that the U.S. Congress
respect Beijing's claim over Taiwan and stop passing resolutions
reaffirming American support for the island.
	   ``We demand that members of the U.S. Congress strictly comply
with the `one China' policy, cease all interference in China's
domestic affairs and refrain from hampering further improvements in
Sino-U.S. relations by using the Taiwan issue,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Tang Guoqiang was quoted as saying by the official Xinhua
News Agency.
	   Tang's comments marked the second time in two weeks he has
criticized the House of Representatives for passing a resolution on
July 20 that promised to continue U.S. arms sales to the island and
called for it to become a member of the World Bank and other
international bodies.
	   Always prickly over perceived foreign interference in its
domestic affairs, China saves its harshest invective for Taiwan's
campaign to win recognition abroad and any foreign backing for that
effort.
	   Congress exhibited ``total disregard for norms guiding
international relations'' and the resolution ``seriously infringed
on China's national sovereignty and wantonly interfered in the
nation's internal affairs,'' Tang was quoted as saying.
	   He earlier denounced the Senate for adopting a similar statement
and accused supporters of the resolutions of plotting to sabotage
warming relations between Washington and Beijing.
	   Members of Congress believed the show of support for Taiwan was
necessary after U.S. President Bill Clinton made statements in
China seen as tilting toward Beijing. Clinton said Washington did
not support an independent Taiwan nor its entry into organizations
of sovereign states.
	   Although the sides have been united for just four of the past
100 years, China continues to claim Taiwan as a renegade province
to be reunited with the mainland by force if necessary.
	   Taiwan is governed by the Nationalists, who fled to the island
after being swept off the mainland by Communist Party-led forces in
1949.

Former Prime Minister Bhutto gets more time to defend herself
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
pleaded for more time Monday to defend herself against corruption
charges, and was granted three weeks before her next court hearing.
	   She was also ordered to post a bond of 5 million rupees (about
dlrs 800,000) to avoid going to jail pending trial in the case
stemming from the government's purchase of tractors to be sold to
farmers at subsidized prices.
	   Ms. Bhutto and her husband Asif Zardari are accused of receiving
kickbacks in the dlrs 33 million tractor deal.
	   Zardari, who was also in court Monday, was ordered to post his
own 5-million-rupee bond in the case, though he is already jailed
in several other cases.
	   Ms. Bhutto had missed a previous hearing because she was in
Dubai visiting her three children, prompting the special corruption
court to issue an arrest warrant that was later overturned.
	   The court set the next hearing for Aug. 20. Judges had
originally scheduled the next hearing for Thursday, but relented
after Ms. Bhutto rose in court to say that would not give her
enough time to prepare her case.
	   ``I will not be able to defend myself,'' said Ms. Bhutto, who
has said the charges against her were fabricated by her political
enemy, current Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
	   Before the hearing, police beat back hundreds of her supporters
who had tried to enter the courtroom. Police feared the supporters
would disrupt the hearing.
	   The judges said Ms. Bhutto and Zardari would not have to appear
at the next hearing, and instead could be represented by their
lawyers.
	   Earlier this month, a Swiss Court indicted Zardari on charges of
money laundering and said it was clearing up details before
charging Ms. Bhutto herself.
	   Zardari has been in jail since his wife's government was
dismissed in November 1996 on charges of corruption and ineptitude.
In Pakistan, he faces charges of corruption as well as murder in
connection with the 1996 shooting death of Ms. Bhutto's estranged
brother, Murtaza. Zardari has denied the charges.
	   Sharif, pledging he would clean up government, swept to power in
elections last year. Once in office, he set out to prove Ms. Bhutto
and her husband took millions of dollars in kickbacks and bribes
and hid the money in Swiss bank accounts.

EU investigates eight European telecom operators
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union said Monday it will
launch a full investigation into mobile telephone fees charged by
eight European fixed telecommunications network operators.
	   The companies are Belgium's Belgacom, Ireland's Telecom Eireann,
British Telecommunications PLC, P&AMP;T Austria, Spain's Telefonica,
KPN Telecom of the Netherlands, Telecom Italia and Germany's
Deutsche Telekom.
	   The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said a
preliminary investigation shows the companies could be charging
excessive prices well over a benchmark set by the EU. But EU
official Stefan Rating said the investigation does not represent a
legal action against the companies.
	   ``This is to increase attention on this issue. We want to get
some eyebrows knitted and get some kind of reaction,'' Rating said.
``We will take account of changes introduced during the
investigation.''
	   He the Commission could take further action the findings
warrant.
	   The Commission will examine what these companies charge mobile
telephone operators on mobile-to-fixed telephone calls and
fixed-to-mobile telephone calls, compared to what other operators
are charged.

Indian strategists urge government not to deploy nuclear weapons
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ARTHUR MAX &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's leading defense analysts argued
Monday against deploying nuclear weapons on the battlefield, saying
it should keep in reserve its newly tested capability to avoid
accidents.
	   Learning from the mistakes of the Cold War, India will neither
deploy weapons nor delegate the authority to use them to the
military, said K. Subrahmanyam, a syndicated writer on defense
affairs.
	   ``The Cuban missile crisis will not happen here,'' he said,
referring to the 1962 confrontation that brought the United States
to the brink of war with the then-Soviet Union.
	   Jasjit Singh, director of the government-funded Institute for
Defense Studies and Analysis, called the emerging Indian strategy a
doctrine of ``recessed deterrent,'' staying one step short of
assembling nuclear weapons.
	   The comments were significant since both analysts had for years
championed India's nuclear program after its initial underground
test in 1974.
	   On May 11, India detonated five explosions under the western
desert, prompting Pakistan to follow suit two weeks later. The
tests were internationally denounced as undermining treaties to
control the spread of nuclear weapons. Several countries, led by
the United States, imposed economic sanctions.
	   The prime ministers of India and Pakistan will meet Wednesday
during a summit in the Sri Lankan capital for the first time since
the tests. Atal Bihari Vajpayee of India has said he will offer a
no-first-use pact to Pakistan's Nawaz Sharif at the seven-nation
summit in Colombo.
	   Subrahmanyam, a former director of the institute now headed by
Singh, said now that India should show restraint now that it has
established a deterrent.
	   ``This is not a military weapon. It is a political instrument.
It should not be used for intimidation. It should be kept only to
prevent others from intimidating us,'' he said, launching the first
book on the nuclear issue since the tests were conducted.
	   The Indian government said it wants a ``minimum nuclear
deterrent'' and has refused to commit to not deploy nuclear weapons
or develop delivery systems for them.
	   Singh, in his book ``Nuclear India,'' advocated developing
ballistic missiles and eventually a sea-based platform to launch
nuclear arms, but urged India not to actually build weapons until
it feels threatened.
	   India has tested a missile with a range of 2,500 kilometers
(1,500 miles) called Agni. Singh said another two dozen tests would
be needed over five years until the Agni is reliable.
	   Since atomic bombs were dropped on Japan in 1945, nations have
threatened to use nuclear weapons or declared nuclear alerts at
least 47 times, Singh said. The most recent incident was a Chinese
threat against Taiwan in March 1996.
	   But Singh rated the probability of war with Pakistan in the next
decade as ``fairly low,'' and with China as ``extremely low.''

Appointment of ex-KGB agent to strengthen Russian security service

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ When President Boris Yeltsin was dismantling the
Soviet system, one of his first moves was to disband the KGB. Now
that Russia is awash with new problems, Yeltsin is looking to the
former KGB for help.
	   Yeltsin appointed former KGB spy Vladimir Putin as head of
Russia's Federal Security Service over the weekend, a move designed
to augment the power of the KGB's main successor agency, Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said Monday.
	   The move is aimed at ``strengthening and fortifying the service,
as well as returning some of its unfairly lost authority,''
Kiriyenko said.
	   When the KGB was split into several services following the 1991
Soviet collapse, the Federal Security Service became its main
successor, but with less influence and power.
	   Yeltsin has recently been moving in the other direction,
expanding the FSB's clout and tapping into the KGB's experience of
imposing control and gathering information.
	   Earlier this year, Yeltsin brought Russia's border guards under
the control of the FSB, giving it a broader mandate in dealing with
counterintelligence and domestic security.
	   Then the president appointed three former KGB agents to key jobs
in his administration that deal with Russia's far-flung regions,
where maverick local leaders have caused headaches for the Kremlin.
	   Until Putin's appointment on Saturday he was first deputy chief
of staff in charge of relations with Russia's regions.
	   With the promotion of the 45-year-old former spy, the FSB could
be regaining some of the power of its predecessor.
	   ``The choice of Vladimir Putin for the post is not accidental,''
Kiriyenko told the FSB's staff when he introduced the new boss on
Monday.
	   As a former intelligence officer stationed in Germany, Putin is
familiar with the whole spectrum of FSB work, and is an expert on
economic and regional issues, Kiriyenko was quoted as saying by the
ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agencies.
	   Regional officials have been blamed for misspending federal
funds allocated to the regions _ thereby contributing to the
chronic problem of unpaid wages and pensions that touched off
recent strikes and protests.
	   Putin's priorities as FSB chief will be combating economic
espionage and illegal capital flight, Kiriyenko said.
	   Kiriyenko denied speculation that Putin's predecessor, Nikolai
Kovalyov, was fired in response to his handling of several recent
incidents, including a spy dispute with South Korea.
	   One analyst suggested the appointment may reflect Yeltsin's
concerns about upcoming presidential elections.
	   ``I think the main reason ... was that they needed a man who
would control the FSB on the eve of the 2000 elections,'' said Igor
Bunin of the Center for Political Technologies, an independent
Russian think-tank.
	   Bunin also dismissed speculations that Kovalyov was ousted to
appease the leaders of separatist Chechnya, who accused Russian
secret services of organizing last week's failed assassination
attempt against Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov.
	   ``Rumors about Kovalyov's dismissal have been circulating for
two or three weeks,'' well before the attack on Maskhadov, Bunin
said.
	   ``The main thing was not to dismiss (Kovalyov); the main thing
was to appoint Putin,'' he added.
	   At least one politician called Putin's appointment
ill-considered.
	   Kovalyov ``was a professional, knowledgeable, reasonable
person,'' said Viktor Ilyukhin, a leading Communist lawmaker and
staunch Yeltsin opponent. ``I'm afraid Putin does not have these
qualities. He still needs to gather political experience.''

Three nuns shot to death in Yemen

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Three nuns who worked with the late Mother
Teresa's Missionaries of Charity were shot to death on Monday as
they left their clinic in the Red Sea city of Hodeida, a Yemeni
security official said.
	   The official said one of the nuns was from the Philippines and
two were Indian.
	   They were killed by gunmen who fired automatic rifles out of a
passing car, he said. He spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.
	   Authorities have arrested one person believed to have been
involved in the attack, the official said. Other officials said the
man was bearded and appeared to be mentally ill. They gave not
other details.
	   The security official said Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh
promised to direct the investigation into the incident.
	   The Calcutta-headquartered Missionaries of Charity have operated
clinics in Yemen since 1970, and its workers have never previously
been attacked, Yemeni officials said.
	   The incident is not believed related to the ongoing battles
between Yemeni tribesmen and the government over price hikes put in
place under an economic reform program supervised by the
International Monetary Fund.
	   Since the price increases went into effect June 19, tribesmen
have blown up oil pipelines, ambushed ministers' motorcades and
opened fire on government buildings.
	   Large parts of Yemen are lawless, inhabited by tribes who do not
hesitate to kidnap foreigners or use firearms to settle scores with
rivals. None of the foreign kidnap victims have been harmed.
	   Monday's attack occurred as the nuns were finishing a visit to
the clinic run by the Calcutta-headquartered Roman Catholic order
for physically and mentally handicapped people, the official said.
	   The clinic is in Hodeida, which is 223 kilometers (138 miles)
west of the capital San`a.
	   The nuns were reported to be wearing white nurses uniforms and
caps, not the traditional blue-bordered saris of the religious
order.
	   After hearing of the incident, the Indian and Italian
ambassadors to San`a demanded a thorough and quick investigation
into the incident.
	   Yemen's Health Minister Abdullah Abdul-Wali Nasher visited the
Hodeida branch of the Missionaries of Charity order to express the
government's sympathy.
	   The religious group was established by Mother Teresa, a Nobel
laureate who died last year.
	   Mother Teresa's successor, Sister Nirmala, was to fly from
Calcutta to visit the Hodeida clinic on Tuesday, an official of the
Missionaries of Charity told The Associated Press in India. She
refused to give details of the killings or comment on them.
	   The Missionaries of Charity order has four branches in the
country's main cities, with a total of 25 workers. They help an
estimated 450 physically and mentally handicapped people.

Fires scorch Mount Olympus; Dozens other fires burn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Firefighters struggled Monday to control a
forest fire scorching the slopes of Mount Olympus, legendary home
of the ancient gods.
	   Dozens of other fires burned through brush and woodlands around
Greece in the devastating seasonal blazes. No villages were in
immediate danger.
	   Hundreds of hectares (thousands of acres) of forest have burned
on Mount Olympus, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) northwest of
Athens, since blazes broke out late last week.
	   Two fire-fighting planes assisted crews on the ground on the
2,917-meter (9,570-foot) Olympus, the highest peak in Greece.
	   Wildfires are common during hot and dry summers in Greece, but
this is the worst season in decades.
	   Four firefighters died last week battling a fire on the
outskirts of Athens.

Minister sets out moderate agenda, risks wrath of hard-liners

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ On his first day at work Monday, Iran's new
interior minister promised to pursue moderate policies that protect
freedom of speech and the rights of individuals.
	   The pledge by Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari to work for the political
and social reforms of President Mohammad Khatami risks
confrontation with Islamic hard-liners, who impeached his
predecessor for being too liberal.
	   Hard-liners fired the first shot in a new battle over the powers
of the Interior Ministry on Sunday by sending out vice police, who
harassed or arrested anyone found violating strict Islamic rules
that had been relaxed after Khatami took over last August.
	   Police set up roadblocks in several parts of the capital and
arrested young men cruising for dates. They also stopped women who
were not completely covered according to the Islamic dress code.
	   ``Three Islamic judges issued sentences on the spot for men who
were found harassing women,'' said Brig. Gen. Hedayat Lotfian, head
of the Disciplinary Forces that also act as the vice police.
	   Khatami's moderate faction has been locked in a power struggle
with Islamic hard-liners, who have been in power for nearly 20
years and have stalled his efforts to allow more political freedoms
and ease Islamic rules.
	   Lari told officials and reporters at the Interior Ministry that
he would work for reforms promised by Khatami.
	   ``Freedom is not something granted by the government or its
officials,'' he said in an attack on the hard-liners. ``It is a
right, and the government's job is only to make sure no one harms
that right...
	   ``It is no art to allow only those to speak who agree with us.
The art is in allowing those who are against us to speak as well.''
	   Lari wore the long robes of a cleric and the black turban that
signifies his descent from Islam's Prophet Mohammed.
	   Khatami's powers are limited. The real power is in the hands of
the hard-line clergy led by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. As supreme
leader, he controls the armed forces, the judiciary, the
intelligence services and the broadcast network.
	   Normally, the interior minister is given control of the security
forces. But Khamenei has withheld transferring authority for the
vice police in an effort to stall Khatami's liberalization.

Council police destroy tourist curio market

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Curio sellers rummaged through their
ruined stalls Monday to see what they could salvage after city
council bulldozers and police smashed and burned what was known to
tourists as the ``Blue Market'' in central Nairobi.
	   ``When I came here, I just got sick'' said handicraft dealer
Anthony Kamau. ``I have lost everything. What kind of government
frustrates people doing their own business?''
	   Ignoring a court order, some 200 city council police Sunday
night sealed off the market area, which covers about half a city
block, as two bulldozers moved in, knocking down the wood and
corrugated iron structures.
	   The area got its name from the blue wooden walls that surrounded
the warren of stalls selling beads, jewelry, soapstone objects,
wood carvings and masks and baskets from east and central Africa as
well as Ethiopia and Somalia.
	   The market area is easily accessible to tourists, who are afraid
to go into other parts of the sprawling city because of robbery and
armed attacks.
	   The city council had proposed moving the market to an area
outside the central business distict where few tourists dare to go.
	   The market was set up in 1980 on land owned by the city council.
A year ago, the council said it had sold the land to the Jamia
Mosque, which is expanding and wanted a parking lot. Traders
complain they were not given an option to buy the land.
	   The ownership and transfer of land in Nairobi and other parts of
Kenya has become a major problem as corrupt officials obtain title
to public land and then sell it for a profit.
	   Last week, the handicraft dealers managed to obtain a court
order restraining Town Clerk Zipporah Wandera from evicting them
until their case was heard Sept. 23.
	   ``They could not even let us in to remove our things. They
wanted us to lose everything,'' said Mary Wanjiru, who specialized
in soapstone carvings and jewellry. ``They were saying they were
obeying orders from above. Which kind of government is this that
cannot respect its court orders?''
	   The traders said they lost goods worth millions of shillings
(hundreds of thousands of dollars).
	   ``I had just came back from the village. When I came here, I
fainted,'' said Jane Kasyoki. ``My stories had been the feeding my
family and my extended family.'' She said she lost goods worth two
million shillings dlrs (33,000 dlrs).

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The successful rescue of a miner given up
for dead after a massive landslide buried him and 10 others in a
talc mine was a virtual miracle, mining experts and doctors said
Monday.
	   They spoke a day after Georg Hainzl, 24, was hoisted by cables
from the 60-meter (200-foot)-deep eating area where he was trapped
by masses of mud following heavy rains July 17.
	   A second, larger mudslide buried 10 others who had been sent to
rescue him after the accident in the town of Lassing, 190
kilometers (120miles) southwest of Vienna.
	   After Hainzl was rescued alive and in surprisingly good health,
rescuers on Monday redoubled their efforts to reach the other ten,
believed trapped 130 meters (430 feet) in the talc mine. Talc is a
soft mineral which is refined into talcum powder and lubricants.
	   During the weekend, officials had said there was no chance that
Hainzl or the others could still be alive so long after the
accident. Someone had ordered eleven coffins already last week, but
the order was later canceled when the local mayor found out about
it.
	   After officials decreed on Sunday that no one else's health
would be put at risk and the rescue operation was winding down,
rescuers decided to continue their efforts to reach an eating area
where Hainzl was trapped before the shaft was to be sealed with
cement.
	   The rescue of Hainzl, whose girlfriend is three months pregnant,
raised new hopes for his missing colleagues.
	   ``He arrive in a very good state (of health),'' said Werner
List, a chief anesthesiologist in a hospital in Graz, where Hainzl
was taken in a decompression chamber.
	   Doctors later said that Hainzl complained about back pain and
showed signs of dehydration. He was also in a state of fear.
	   Hainzl spent almost 10 days without food and water in complete
darkness. He did not dare to drink muddy water, fearing for his
health, doctors said.
	   Dr. a-Maria Smolle-Juttner said the physically fit miner
survived his ordeal because, ``overall, a humid atmosphere
prevailed and his body hardly released liquid.''
	   ``He repeatedly heard drilling noie,'' hoping to be rescued, she
said. ``But in the end he did not believe any more in his rescue,''
sitting on a table in darkness.
	   After several hours of sleep, Hainzl was surprisingly alert and
hungry, asking for a local breakfast dish which doctors overruled
as too greasy.
	   ``He has now eaten and drunk, talked with his father over
earphones,'' Smolle-Juttner said, adding her patient will remain
several days under intensive care for medical observation.
	   ``He feels good and wanted to go home this afternoon, but then
realized it would be better to stay for some time,'' Smolle-Juttner
told reporters.
	   Hainzl asked to be taken from a single-bed room to a four-bed
room because he is frightened. Psychologists said he will need
therapy for months.
	   Chancellor Viktor Klima and other government officials rushed to
the scene early Monday to thank rescuers for their effort and to
urge them to keep digging for other possible survivors. But chances
to retrieve them alive were said to be virtually nil.
	   According to Austrian state radio, Klima also criticized that
Hainzl and the others had been given up too early and that experts
had applied the ``calculus of probability'' rather than remain
hopeful and optimistic in their work.

Cambodian leader Hun Sen might lose in favorite district
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KRAING YOV, Cambodia (AP) _ The road to Kraing Yov is dotted
with bridges and irrigation systems built by strongman Hun Sen. His
name appears on school buildings and temple gates, announcing to
newcomers that they have crossed on to his turf.
	   Though he has spent millions of dollars developing Kraing Yov
since he made pulling it out of poverty a pet project three years
ago, Hun Sen appears about to get a shock _ many of his
beneficiaries turned their backs on him in Sunday's parliamentary
elections.
	   Hun Sen should have swept Kraing Yov. Instead, according to
results witnessed by reporters at local counting stations,
residents of the area were giving his party only a narrow lead and
the possibility remained he could lose to his main challenger,
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, whom Hun Sen toppled in a bloody coup
just one year ago.
	   ``We were planning to go catch fish and drink to celebrate,''
said Am Em, 40, a villager wearing a watch bearing Hun Sen's
portrait. ``But now we have to wait and see.''
	   Hun Sen called the elections in a bid to win back legitimacy and
aid lost after his violent takeover, but critics said that he
stacked the electoral machinery with his backers and used
intimidation and violence to ensure victory.
	   Though official results have not yet been tallied in Kraing Yov,
things do not look good for Hun Sen.
	   It's unclear why Hun Sen wouldn't do well here. He comes often
to give speeches, some lasting as long as three hours. People
dutifully come out to hear them. Opponents say that people from
around Kraing Yov supply some of the muscle when Hun Sen uses
strongarm tactics.
	   Khim Vorn, 50, a village official who said his living conditions
have improved considerably thanks to Hun Sen's agricultural
projects in Kraing Yov, was stunned. He figured Hun Sen would have
won in a landslide.
	   ``I am frustrated,'' said Khim Vorn, sitting across the road
from a pagoda decorated with Hun Sen's name and his wife's, Bun
Rainy. Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party ``should have won all the
votes.''
	   Inside the compound where Khim Vorn lives are concrete offices,
including a health center, and heavy agricultural machinery donated
by and named after Hun Sen.
	   ``These are thanks to Hun Sen,'' he said, pointing to a water
canal on the side of the road, adding that FUNCINPEC, in
comparison, gave a few wells to the area several years ago and
nothing else.
	   His colleagues expressed fears that, if FUNCINPEC won in Kraing
Yov but Hun Sen remained the real power in Cambodia _ as he has
been for the past decade _ the pumping of water to their fields may
stop and their rice crop may die.
	   ``There must be a reason, but I don't know what. But this is
democracy; everyone voted according to their ideas, not pressure,''
said Khim Vorn.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Curio sellers rummaged through their
ruined stalls Monday to see what they could salvage after city
council bulldozers and police smashed and burned what was known to
tourists as the ``Blue Market'' in central Nairobi.
	   ``When I came here, I just got sick'' said handicraft dealer
Anthony Kamau. ``I have lost everything. What kind of government
frustrates people doing their own business?''
	   Ignoring a court order, some 200 city council police Sunday
night sealed off the market area, which covers about half a city
block, as two bulldozers moved in, knocking down the wood and
corrugated iron structures.
	   The area got its name from the blue wooden walls that surrounded
the warren of stalls selling beads, jewelry, soapstone objects,
wood carvings and masks and baskets from east and central Africa as
well as Ethiopia and Somalia.
	   The market area is easily accessible to tourists, who are afraid
to go into other parts of the sprawling city because of robbery and
armed attacks.
	   The city council had proposed moving the market to an area
outside the central business distict where few tourists dare to go.
	   The market was set up in 1980 on land owned by the city council.
A year ago, the council said it had sold the land to the Jamia
Mosque, which is expanding and wanted a parking lot. Traders
complain they were not given an option to buy the land.
	   The ownership and transfer of land in Nairobi and other parts of
Kenya has become a major problem as corrupt officials obtain title
to public land and then sell it for a profit.
	   Last week, the handicraft dealers managed to obtain a court
order restraining Town Clerk Zipporah Wandera from evicting them
until their case was heard Sept. 23.
	   ``They could not even let us in to remove our things. They
wanted us to lose everything,'' said Mary Wanjiru, who specialized
in soapstone carvings and jewelry. ``They were saying they were
obeying orders from above. Which kind of government is this that
cannot respect its court orders?''
	   The traders said they lost goods worth millions of shillings
(hundreds of thousands of dollars).
	   ``I had just came back from the village. When I came here, I
fainted,'' said Jane Kasyoki. ``My stores had been feeding my
family and my extended family.'' She said she lost goods worth two
million shillings dlrs (33,000 dlrs).

Thai central bank eases rules for firms raising funds overseas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's central bank said Monday it
will ease reserve requirements for financial institutions raising
short-term funds overseas, a move aimed at boosting demand for
baht-denominated bonds issued by the Bank of Thailand.
	   Banks and finance companies that take out overseas loans due in
less than one year will be allowed to count government and
state-enterprise bonds in fulfilling their reserve requirements,
Salinee Wangtal, the central bank's deputy director for financial
institutions regulations, told a news conference.
	   Currently, these banks and finance companies must deposit with
the central bank 6 percent of the value of those short-term funds.
The deposits must be in cash only and the central bank pays no
interest.

Japan's Sanyo Electric ties up with IBM on computer chips
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Sanyo Electric Co. and International
Business Machines Corp. will join in developing, manufacturing and
selling sophisticated semiconductors, Sanyo said Monday.
	   Under the agreement, Sanyo, a maker of consumer electronics,
will gain access to IBM's expertise in producing the most advanced
semiconductors, the company said in a press release.
	   In return, Sanyo will help IBM sell more of its chips in Japan.
	   The two companies will work together to develop semiconductors
that run advanced electronic devices such as mobile phones, digital
TVs and digital cameras. They hope to start selling jointly
developed chips in one or two years, Sanyo said.
	   Sanyo also plans to expand its business in all-in-one computer
chips, known as large-scale integrated circuits, or LSI's. Sanyo
aims to use the chips to design electronic products that
incorporate computer and network functions, such as TVs that work
as videophones or allow viewers to gain access to the Internet.

Thailand establishes funds to allow foreigners buy real estate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Securities and Exchange
Commission said Monday it has approved the establishment of eight
funds designed to allow foreign ownership of property and relieve
local financial institutions of bad debt.
	   SEC spokeswoman Ruenvadee Suwanmongkol said that as of Friday,
applications for seven property funds and one mutual fund worth a
combined 16.2 billion baht (dlrs 395 million) have been approved.
	   More than 90 applications have been received, but decisions on
most of them are pending receipt of more complete information, she
said.
	   Last week, applications were approved for four property funds
worth 9.9 billion baht (dlrs 241 million) to be set up by BBL Asset
Management, an affiliate of Bangkok Bank, the country's largest
bank.
	   Ruenvadee said the funds will allow foreigners to help inject
cash back into a moribund property sector.
	   ``(The funds) are designed for private placement to foreign
institutional investors. They have to be set up by a local company
with a mutual fund license,'' she said.
	   Under Thai law, foreigners are not allowed to own property,
although they may own up to 40 percent of the units at any
condominium. The new property funds must have a minimum of 10
shareholders, but they can be sold entirely to foreign financial
institutions, while the property remains legally in the hands of a
Thai company.
	   The government needs foreign investors to participate in the
auction of assets formerly owned by 56 finance companies shut down
by the central bank last year and ordered into liquidation.
	   The core assets of the closed companies, nominally worth 760
billion baht (dlrs 18.5 billion), consist mostly of loans. Many of
those loans are to a property sector suffering from oversupply and
a collapse in credit and cash flow amid a severe recession.

Opposition economics expert takes on Sunday shopping ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The millionaire businessman picked to be
economics minister if the Social Democrats unseat Chancellor Helmut
Kohl faced renewed fire Monday from his party's traditional allies
_ the unions _ this time over his proposal to do away with
regulations on store hours.
	   Jost Stollmann, a computer entrepreneur without party
affiliation, called Germany's shopping laws a ``fossil'' and said
shoppers and store employees alike eventually would demand longer
evening and weekend shopping hours.
	   Labor unions and church groups have been most vocal in defending
Germany's shopping limits, which force stores to close at 8 p.m.
weekdays, 4 p.m. on Saturdays and altogether on Sundays. Church
groups say there should be no commerce on the Sunday sabbath, and
union groups say store clerks already are overworked.
	   Roldan Issen, head of the DAG white-collar union, said Monday
that Stollmann should stick to the Social Democrats' campaign
position backing the current store hours.
	   Most shop clerks are women and expanding weekend shopping hours
would make it more difficult for women to balance roles as mothers
and bread-winners, Issen said.
	   Ahead of Sept. 27 national elections, Stollmann already has
angered labor groups with tough, free-market proposals including
cutting subsidies to old industries such as coal. He also has
questioned the usefulness of a government-sponsored ``alliance for
jobs'' with business and labor, which the Social Democrats have
proposed to fight unemployment.
	   Despite drawing criticism from both friends and foes of the
left-leaning Social Democrats, the party's chancellor candidate
Gerhard Schroeder has stood behind his choice of Stollmann, saying
Germany needs independent thinkers.
	   If you try to be ``everybody's darling'' you risk becoming
``everybody's fool,'' Schroeder said Monday.

Spain destroys first batch of antipersonnel mines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CACERES, Spain (AP) _ Spain began destroying its stockpile of
over 800,000 anti-personal landmines Monday, in compliance with
last December's Ottawa treaty.
	   The first three mines were symbolically incinerated at an
explosives factory near this western Spanish city by Defense
Minister Eduardo Serra, ministry spokesman Antonio Castro said.
	   About 1,000 mines are due to pass through the factory's
incinerators every day for over two years at a total cost of over
500 million pesetas (dlrs 3.3 million).
	   A small proportion of the mines will be kept for use in training
exercises, Castro said.
	   An international draft treaty banning the production, export and
use of landmines was signed by 121 nations in Ottawa, Canada last
December.
	   The treaty allowed four years for the destruction of all
stockpiled land mines, and 10 years for the deactivation of
minefields. Serra told reporters that Spain was at ``the vanguard''
of landmine destruction.
	   The ministry is destroying Spanish landmines, leaving a question
mark over what will happen to mines belonging to United States
military bases in Spanish territory, Castro said.
	   The U.S. did not sign the Ottawa treaty and is therefore not
obliged to destroy its own mines, but anti-mine campaigners have
been pressuring signatories to destroy all mines within their
borders.
	   An estimated 100 million antipersonnel mines are deployed in
about 60 countries worldwide, often killing or crippling people
decades after a conflict has ended.

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Three nuns who worked with the late Mother
Teresa's Missionaries of Charity were shot to death on Monday as
they left their clinic in the Red Sea city of Hodeida, a Yemeni
security official said.
	   The official said one of the Roman Catholic nuns was from the
Philippines and two were Indian.
	   Gunmen fired automatic rifles out of a passing car killed the
women, said the official, who spoke on customary condition of
anonymity. The nuns were wearing white nurses uniforms and caps,
not the traditional blue-bordered saris of the religious order.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.
	   Authorities have arrested one person believed to have been
involved in the attack, the security official said. Other officials
said the man was bearded and appeared to be mentally ill, but did
not give other details.
	   The security official said Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh
promised to direct the investigation.
	   The Calcutta-headquartered Missionaries of Charity have operated
medical clinics in Yemen since 1970, and its workers have never
previously been attacked, Yemeni officials said.
	   Large parts of Yemen are lawless, inhabited by tribes who do not
hesitate to kidnap foreigners or use firearms to settle scores with
rivals. None of the foreign kidnap victims have been harmed.
	   But the incident is not believed related to the ongoing battles
between Yemeni tribesmen and the government over price hikes put in
place under an economic reform program supervised by the
International Monetary Fund.
	   Since the price increases went into effect June 19, tribesmen
have blown up oil pipelines, ambushed ministers' motorcades and
opened fire on government buildings.
	   Monday's attack occurred as the nuns were finishing a visit to
the clinic for people with physical and mental disabilities in
Hodeida, which is 223 kilometers (138 miles) west of the capital
San`a.
	   The Indian and Italian ambassadors demanded a thorough and quick
investigation.
	   Yemen's Health Minister Abdullah Abdul-Wali Nasher visited the
Hodeida branch of the Missionaries of Charity order to express the
government's sympathy.
	   The religious group was established by Mother Teresa, a Nobel
laureate who died last year.
	   Mother Teresa's successor, Sister Nirmala, was to fly from
Calcutta to visit the Hodeida clinic on Tuesday, an official of the
Missionaries of Charity told The Associated Press in India. She
refused to give details of the killings or comment on them.
	   The Missionaries of Charity order has four branches in the
country's main cities, with a total of 25 workers. They help an
estimated 450 physically and mentally handicapped people.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The discovery of nearly 50 decomposing
bodies near a refugee center prompted officials to expand an
exclusion zone around Papua New Guinea's tsunami disaster area
Monday as the official death toll grew to 2,000.
	   Government spokesman Chris Hawkins said the toll of 2,000 was an
estimate because not all bodies had been physically counted.
	   But the latest figure was not expected to change significantly,
because officers of the Disaster and Emergency Center believe they
have accounted for almost all of the missing, Hawkins said.
	   Emergency center officers had completed a head count in refugee
villages in the disaster area, finding 10,063 people, Hawkins said
from Brisbane, Australia.
	   This figure is greater than the number of people the government
said last week were in the area when the tsunami struck. Hawkins
said the discrepancy occurred because the last census was in 1990
and the government had underestimated population growth.
	   ``What we put it down to is that it has been so long since the
last census and the difficulties in just getting around to all the
refugee villages in the area to make a count of the survivors,''
Hawkins told The Associated Press.
	   ``There has been a lot of confusion.''
	   Three waves hit a 22-mile (35-kilometer) stretch of coast in
West Sepik province on July 17, sweeping four villages into Sissano
Lagoon and sending thousands of survivors fleeing into the jungle.
	   Last week, officials sealed off the lagoon, banning people from
entering an area of about 8 square miles (20 square kilometers)
because of fears of disease outbreaks caused by contact with water
contaminated by bodies or with the bodies themselves.

	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ A Saudi convicted of murdering his
wife was beheaded Monday, the Interior Ministry said.
	   Ahmed bin Ateek al-Zahrani shot his wife Salha bint Ahmed while
she slept, the ministry's statement said.
	   Al-Zahrani was beheaded in the southern city of Baha.
	   His execution brings to 19 the number of people beheaded in the
kingdom this year. Last year 124 people were executed.
	   Saudi Arabia's Islamic courts impose the death sentence for
murder, rape, drug trafficking and armed robbery. Executions are
carried out with a sword in public.
	   Human rights groups have criticized the executions, saying that
suspects do not receive fair trials, are denied lawyers and do not
have the right to appeal.

Arsonists attack Italian embassy cars, FIAT dealerships
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES total of 12 cars destroyed, group saying attacks to
protest deaths of two anarchists in Italian jails &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Arsonists early Monday burned two cars
belonging to Italian embassy officials and 10 cars parked at two
FIAT automobile dealerships. Bomb disposal experts also detonated a
suspicious package placed outside a Ferrari dealer. No one was
injured in any of the attacks.
	   Police said the Italian embassy cars, parked in central Athens,
were doused in gasoline at 1:25 a.m. (1025 GMT) and set ablaze.
They believe the FIAT cars, parked outside the dealerships on the
outskirts of central Athens, were destroyed by propane cooking gas
canisters soaked in gasoline. A total of 10 cars were destroyed
outside the dealerships.
	   The attacks against the embassy cars and dealerships all
occurred within 30 minutes of each other. A few hours later, police
used a robot to detonate a package outside a Ferrari dealership,
also on the outskirts of the city center, but discovered it was
filled with pebbles.
	   The attack was claimed in a telephone call to a local television
station by a little-know group called ``Arsonists for Social
Cohesion.''
	   The group said the attacks were to protest the July 12 death in
a Turin, Italy, prison of 22-year-old Maria Soledad Rosas, a young
anarchist who was reportedly found dead in a shower stall with a
bedsheet around her neck. The were also protesting the April
suicide of another anarchist in a Turin jail.
	   A number of similar, small and prolific terrorist groups have
this year carried out more than 150 firebombings, mostly against
cars belonging to government officials, diplomats, journalists and
foreign companies. The attacks resulted in only one injury.
	   Most of the attacks have been carried out using propane tanks
soaked in gasoline.
	   Officials have been unable to stop the attacks, which have
increased fears of harm to Greece's vital tourism industry.

Duma's panel considers long-shot impeachment motion against
</HEADLINE>
Yeltsin &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin's parliamentary foes debated on
Monday his role in the collapse of the Soviet Union in their search
for legal grounds to support a impeachment motion against the
Russian president.
	   Several previous attempts to oust Yeltsin have failed, and this
initiative is expected to meet the same fate. But the process begun
by hard-liners in the lower house of parliament, the State Duma,
could erode the government's authority and strengthen the
Communist-led opposition.
	   The parliamentary commission assigned to draw up formal charges
against Yeltsin began listening Monday to Communist lawmakers who
have accused the president of several transgressions.
	   They blamed Yeltsin for instigating the collapse of the Soviet
Union by signing a December 1991 agreement with Ukraine and Belarus
declaring the Soviet Union defunct. The agreement created the
Commonwealth of Independent States, a loose coalition of former
Soviet republics.
	   Two prominent Communist lawmakers, Viktor Ilyukhin and Anatoly
Lukyanov, who sponsored the impeachment motion, said Yeltsin's
action amounted to high treason because Russia lost much its wealth
and military might in the Soviet collapse.
	   ``Boris Nikolayevich (Yeltsin) has never cared for the country,
only for his own power,'' Ilyukhin said.
	   Yeltsin and other government officials have repeatedly said that
the Soviet breakup was imminent, precipitated by the botched August
1991 hard-line coup against Mikhail Gorbachev and the virtual
collapse of the Soviet economy.
	   Supporters of the impeachment motion also accuse Yeltsin of
launching the botched war in Chechnya, ruining Russia's economy and
military, and using troops and tanks against his foes in the former
Russian parliament in October 1993.
	   Yeltsin has ignored the parliamentary commission and did not
send a representative to take part in its work Monday.
	   The commission hopes to finish its work by fall, when the State
Duma convenes after its summer recess.
	   Even the authors of the impeachment motion acknowledged it was
unlikely to succeed.
	   ``I don't think that we have a strong chance,'' said Lukyanov,
who had been one of Gorbachev's closest friends and advisers, and
served as one of the last speakers of the Soviet parliament. ``We
don't have any illusions.''
	   Russia's constitution gives the president a strong hand in
confrontations with parliament, which would make it difficult, if
not impossible, for Yeltsin's foes to succeed. The constitution is
vague on the grounds for which a president can be impeached, citing
only treason and grave misconduct.
	   A two-thirds majority in parliament's lower house would be
needed to formally launch an impeachment motion.
	   The motion then would require confirmation from both the
Constitutional and Supreme Courts, as well as the upper chamber of
parliament, the Federation Council consisting of regional leaders
most of whom are usually loyal to Yeltsin.

Officials say King Hussein has undergone chemotherapy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ King Hussein has undergone chemotherapy
treatment at an American hospital following reports he may have
lymphatic cancer, Jordanian officials said Monday.
	   The king's brother, Crown Prince Hassan, said the monarch may
soon leave the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, after initial
treatment but would remain in the Midwestern state for a ``period
of rest.''
	   ``We hope to hear the good results of the first stage of
treatment in the coming two days, and the king will possibly leave
hospital in the coming few days,'' Hassan told Jordanian soldiers
Sunday. His remarks were published by Amman dailies Monday.
	   Officials of the Royal Palace and the government confirmed an
Israeli report that Hussein underwent chemotherapy treatment three
days ago and he is responding to it.
	   But they added, speaking on customary condition of anonymity,
that the results of tests to show whether the king had lymphoma, or
cancer of the lymphatic tissue, were still being awaited.
	   Hussein disclosed the possibility of lymphoma in a letter to his
brother Hassan which was read on Jordanian television last week.
But he said his persistent fever may have other causes and tests
were still awaited to confirm the diagnosis.
	   The king is expected to deliver a message to the Jordanian
people Tuesday about his diagnosis and the results of treatment.
	   He was admitted to the Mayo Clinic on July 14 after suffering
from persistent bouts of fever.
	   Christian churches and Muslim mosques in Jordan held services
during the week to pray to God to cure Hussein and return him home
safely.
	   Hussein underwent surgery to remove cancer from his ureter and
left kidney at the Mayo Clinic in 1992 and has had regular medical
checkups at the clinic since.
	   He had an operation in November 1997 to remove an inflamed lymph
gland that was found to be benign. In April 1997, he had surgery
for an enlarged prostate that also was benign.

Russia's grain harvest up in first half of 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia has harvested 11 million metric tons (12
million tons) of grain in the first half of 1998, up from 9 million
metric tons (9.9 million tons) at the same time last year, a news
agency reported Monday.
	   Farmers have been able to gather grain from nearly twice as much
land this year, or 5.7 million hectares (14 million acres), the
Interfax news agency said.
	   However, yields per hectare (acre), were down almost 8 percent,
it said.
	   The percentage of non-food grain in this year's harvest shrunk
to 26 percent of all gathered grain, down from 39 percent.
	   Russian experts still predict that the country's overall annual
grain harvest will be down this year because of a spring drought.
Farmers have been unable to collect their entire crop because of
rainy weather and equipment shortages.

Thai finance firm has deal for partnership with Japanese firm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai Investment and Securities plans to
announce next month a deal with prospective foreign partners
including Japan's Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, a senior executive at the
Thai finance company said Monday.
	   Chirapa Parawongse, executive vice president, said Thai
Investment and Securities is close to completing negotiations with
prospective partners but declined to provide further details.
	   However, she denied local press reports that the finance company
already has decided to let Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank take a 75 percent
stake in the company. She also denied reports that Bankers Trust of
the United States had sold its 20 percent stake in the finance
company to Dai-Ichi Kangyo.
	   Thai Investment and Securities plans to increase capital by 2
billion baht (dlrs 47.6 million) to 3 billion baht (dlrs 68.4
million). To raise capital, the company said it will issue 200
million new shares with 10 baht (dlrs 0.25) par value. The company
plans to offer all the new shares in a private placement to
institutional investors.
	   Like many local finance companies, Thai Investment and
Securities is looking for foreign partners to help it raise capital
and survive the country's worst financial crisis in decades.

Nokia to make dlrs 185 million investment in Hungary, Finland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Taking advantage of surging profits and
sales, Finnish telecommunications group Nokia said Monday it will
invest nearly 1 billion markkaa (dlrs 185 million) to increase
mobile phone production.
	   The investment will be for a new manufacturing plant and
distribution center in Hungary, and for increasing cellular phone
production at Nokia's plant in Salo, south Finland.
	   Nokia, which last week reported a record half-year profit of
5.55 billion markkaa (dlrs 1.02), said it expects some 600 million
cellular phone subscribers worldwide by the end of 2001 _ up from
200 million at the end of 1997.
	   ``Coupled with the subscriber increase, the mobile phone sales
volumes are growing due to the rise of the replacement market,''
said Matti Alahuhta, president of Nokia's mobile phones division.
	   In addition to the Salo plant, Nokia has mobile phone
manufacturing units in Germany, the United States, Mexico, Brazil,
China and South Korea.
	   Last year, Nokia sold 21 million cellular hand sets, making it
the world's second largest mobile phone maker after Motorola Inc.,
based in Schaumburg, Illinois.
	   During January to June this year, Nokia increased net sales of
mobile phones by 41 percent over the same period 1997, to 18.95
billion markkaa (dlrs 3.5 billion).
	   Nokia is a world leader in digital mobile phone technology, and
has supplied GSM equipment to 67 operators in 35 countries. Its
total sales encompass 130 countries, with main markets in the
United States, Britain, Germany and China. It employs 41,000 people
worldwide.
	   Nokia's total pretax profit last year more than doubled to a
record 8.37 billion markkaa (dlrs 1.55 billion).

Drug-related crimes in Russia continue to rise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Drug-related crimes in Russia rose nearly 25
percent in the first half of 1998 compared with the same time last
year, a news agency reported Monday.
	   Roughly 66,000 drug-related crimes were committed from January
to June, a statistic that led Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov to
call Russia's drug problem ``difficult, but not hopeless.''
	   Skuratov also warned that the number of HIV-positive cases among
drug addicts in Russia is on the rise, the Interfax news agency
said.
	   Russia has waged a losing battle with drug use in recent years.
Drug-related crimes nearly doubled last year to 185,000. More than
2 million Russians use drugs regularly, a figure that Skuratov said
is expected to double by 2000.
	   Skuratov also said that a ``drug lobby'' has emerged in Russia
that is pressuring local and regional legislators to block tougher
anti-drug laws.

Stewart puts wins beyond doubt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Alec Stewart played a no-nonsense
almost run-a-ball innings Monday to put victory in the fourth
cricket test against South Africa beyond doubt and claim his first
test win as England captain.
	   In the process, Stewart (45 not out) denied former skipper Mike
Atherton of a well-deserved century _ although Atherton hit the
winning runs to be not-out 98 when England posted victory at Trent
Bridge.
	   England started the day needing 139 runs to win and with nine
wickets in hand. The home side still needed 55 runs when Nassar
Hussain was out for 58.
	   Stewart strode to the crease determined not to let South Africa
make any further breakthroughs. He belted Allan Donald for three
boundaries in one over to signal his intention of winning as
quickly as possible.
	   After being outclassed and outplayed by the South Africans in
the second and third tests, England won by eight wickets and now
has a chance to win the series with one test remaining at Headingly
next week.

India, Pakistan nuclear tests, economic crises raised at ASEAN
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Myanmar, Cambodia statements, Mongolia admitted &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos ASEAN101-113 &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURINDA KEYS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A forum of Asian and Western nations
criticized Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests Monday but hesitated
to join the United States in condemning Myanmar's human rights
record.
	   A statement issued at the end of the meeting of ministers from
20 countries plus the European Union ``strongly deplored'' India's
and Pakistan's recent explosions and urged them to sign
international treaties against further proliferation.
	   A team from the 21-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations
Regional Forum will try to persuade India and Pakistan to sign the
treaties by the end of the year, said Philippine Foreign Secretary
Domingo Siazon, the host of the meeting.
	   He said there was a danger following the tests that other
nations would be tempted to become nuclear weapons states as well.
	   But the annual security discussions of the ASEAN Regional Forum
softened an earlier draft of its statement that had ``condemned''
the tests because a few participants felt a member of the group
should not be harshly denounced, Siazon said.
	   India is a member of the forum but Pakistan is not. Mongolia was
added Monday as its 22nd member.
	   India's representative, deputy planning chairman Jaswant Singh,
expressed sadness over the statement. He had argued that India had
good reasons to conduct the May 11 and 13 tests ``because the
non-proliferation regime had turned flawed and discriminatory.''
	   Delegates said sensitive issues had been debated fully and
frankly in private, including a dispute over islands in the South
China Sea, Indonesia's rule over East Timor, Japan's slowness to
jump start its economy, Cambodia's elections and Myanmar's slow
pace of reform since it joined ASEAN last year.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, noting she could not
get consensus to denounce Myanmar, held a separate news conference
to warn its military government that the United States will hold it
``directly responsible'' for the health and welfare of Nobel
laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.
	   The 1993 peace prize winner spent a fourth day stuck in a car on
a rural highway west of Yangon, the Myanmar capital, surrounded by
government security personnel. She is being prevented from driving
160 kilometers (100 miles) west to meet members of her political
party, the National League for Democracy, whose victory in 1990
elections was ignored by the military government.
	   Siazon said Albright's concerns were vague and ``we have noticed
no deterioration in (Suu Kyi's) health or her capacity to think.''
	   In another obvious difference between the United States and its
Southeast Asian partners, Siazon issued an optimistic assessment of
Sunday's elections in Cambodia, while Albright expressed doubts and
fears.
	   Last year, ASEAN delayed Cambodia's admission to the group
because of a coup led by co-Prime Minister Hun Sen. If the results
of the elections are determined to be reasonably free, fair and
open, ASEAN hopes to absorb Cambodia as its 10th member by the end
of the year.
	   ``The prevailing assessment of the voting was generally peaceful
and orderly and I share everybody's hope that the next stages of
guarding the ballots, counting and proclamation would also be
peaceful and orderly,'' Siazon said.
	   Albright, however, said: ``We have seen the democratic process
in Cambodia unravel before. The real test of Cambodia's democracy
will come after the ballots are counted. ... While we cannot impose
democracy in Cambodia, we should continue to encourage it by making
our assistance to any government conditional on respect for
international norms.''
	   Japan's prime minister-in-waiting Keizo Obuchi, representing
Asia's largest economy, pledged to help weaker nations by pulling
Japan out of recession through a dlrs 43 billion tax cut and dlrs
71 billion in government spending.
	   Albright also received a fresh assurance that China would keep
its promise to stop targeting 13 nuclear missiles at U.S. cities,
although Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan did not say when it would do
so.
	   ASEAN comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
	   They meet annually in the Regional Forum with Australia,
Cambodia, Canada, China, the European Union, India, Japan, South
Korea, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Russia, and the United
States.

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Italian Premier Romano Prodi and Turkish
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz held talks here Monday on Ankara's
difficult relations with the European Union, Greece and Cyprus.
	   ``I suggested a few concrete points that may help Ankara come
closer to Brussels,'' Prodi told reporters before boarding a boat
with Yilmaz for a cruise on the Bosporus strait that separates
Istanbul's European and Asian shores.
	   Ankara put its relations with the 15-member union on hold in
December when the EU decided to exclude Turkey from the initial
round of enlargement talks because of its poor human rights record
and its ongoing disputes with EU-member Greece.
	   Yilmaz said Turkey expected the EU to make the next move.
	   Italy -- along with Britain, France, and Spain -- are reported
to have pressed their EU partners for more favorable treatment of
Turkey.
	   ``I have always felt that Ankara was close to Brussels,'' Prodi
said on his one-day visit.
	   The two leaders also discussed bilateral relations and trade.
	   Italy is Turkey's second largest trade partner. Trade volume
between the two countries is estimated at dlrs 5.7 billion.
	   Several projects of joint cooperation for investments in Central
Asia are reportedly under discussion.

Russia begins military exercises near Chechnya

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia began military exercises in the Caucasus
region on Monday in an effort to ease increasing violence in its
restive southern republics of Chechnya and Dagestan, a news agency
reported.
	   The exercises follow President Boris Yeltsin's recent overtures
of support for Chechnya's government and his decision to have Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko resume negotiations with the president of
the secessionist republic.
	   The military maneuvers, which run until Friday, are designed to
tighten coordination between various forces to fight terrorist
attacks, free hostages, and combat smuggling _ exactly the sort of
incidents on the rise in Russia's fringe republics.
	   ``Measures aiming to maintain law and public order in the region
should be comprehensive and carried out according to a single
plan,'' said Russian Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin, according
to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Stepashin said the exercises ``do not mean that somebody is
preparing for some massive combat action.''
	   Chechnya and Dagestan have been plagued by a rise in
kidnappings, killings, and theft. Maskhadov, who declared a state
of emergency in Chechnya last month, narrowly escaped a car bomb on
Thursday that killed two of his bodyguards.
	   Forces taking part in the exercises include the Interior
Ministry, the Border Guard Service, the Federal Security Service,
and troops stationed around Stavropol, 1,200 kilometers (750 miles)
south of Moscow.
	   Yeltsin ordered Kiriyenko to meet this week with Maskhadov to
demonstrate support for his government, even though the Chechen
president led a 1994-96 war for independence from Russia that ended
in political deadlock.
	   ``The simple fact of this meeting is very important,'' Ivan
Rybkin, Russia's top negotiator with the Chechens, told the
Interfax news agency.
	   ``After a long break, negotiations between Moscow and Grozny
will occur at a high level. In that period, many bitter problems
have accumulated that can be destroyed only by the leaders of
Russia and Chechnya.''
	   A time and location for the talks has not been set.
	   Though Maskhadov said he favored new negotiations, he blamed
Russia for Chechnya's present situation.
	   Maskhadov also ruled out any compromise on the republic's
independence, repeating that Chechnya would never sign a document
``which might limit Chechnya's independence even by one percent,''
he told the Interfax news agency.
	   Six people have been arrested so far in connection with the car
bomb attack on Maskhadov, but by Monday afternoon three were
released, the Interfax news agency said.
	   One of the people being held is an elderly man whose apartment
was used by gunmen during the attack, Interfax said.

Malaysia threatens press with sedition act and jail
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with journalist group's reaction, grafs 4, 12-13 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's Information Ministry
has threatened to jail members of the local media without trial and
to ``black out'' foreign news reports that it believes undermine
the country's leadership, a news report said Monday.
	   ``If the media indulges in activities that threaten political
stability or national unity, we will come down hard, regardless of
whether they are local or foreign,'' Deputy Information Minister
Suleiman Mohamad was quoted as saying by the Sun newspaper.
	   Suleiman told local reporters Sunday that foreign media, abetted
by conspirators in the local press, were using the economic crisis
to further an agenda to topple Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Reporters Sans Frontieres, a Paris-based journalists'
organization, responded with a statement faxed to Mahathir saying:
``Our organization asks you to allow local and foreign journalists
to report on the economic crisis and on Malaysian political life
without fear and pressure.'' A copy was faxed to The Associated
Press.
	   Suleiman warned the press to halt what he called an ``ongoing
conspiracy,'' saying there were several ways to mute the media.
	   ``The local media is kept in check with the Internal Security
Act,'' said Suleiman, referring to a law that permits authorities
to jail suspects without trial for inciting public unrest.
	   Another way to curb negative reports by foreign media was to
``black out'' their stories or counter them with reports by the
government news agency, Bernama, the minister said.
	   ``People suffer when there is political unrest,'' Suleiman said.
``Do they want us to riot, like in Jakarta?''
	   The Malaysian government has strongly censured the foreign media
and local press lately for ``negative'' coverage that highlighted
Malaysia's problems in dealing with the economic crisis and
differences among top leaders.
	   The editors of the country's top two newspapers were abruptly
moved earlier this month, reportedly over differences with the
ruling party.
	   Mahathir has shown little patience for criticism during his
17-year rule. In a nationwide crackdown on dissent in 1987, three
national newspapers were closed down.
	   In its statement, Reporters Sans Frontieres urged Malaysia's
government to abolish the Internal Security Act and guarantee press
freedom in the country.
	   The organization also urged Malaysia to sign and ratify the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 19 of
which states that ``everyone shall have the right ... to seek,
receive and impart information.''

 &UR; German nun found murdered in South Africa &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Police on Monday were searching for
the killers of a German nun, whose body was found in a rural area
north of this coastal city five days after she disappeared.
	   Sister Theodelind Schreck, 57, principal of a school in Eshowe,
was found face down in the woods near a road Sunday. She apparently
suffered a gunshot wound, police said.
	   Police believe the motive was robbery, said spokesman Bala
Naidoo.
	   The Roman Catholic nun disappeared on Wednesday after dropping
off her nephew at a nearby mission. She was on her way back to
Eshowe, near the Indian Ocean coast and about 130 kilometers (80
miles) north of Durban.
	   Her car had been found in a poor area outside the city. In it
were the nun's identification document; a tire and the radio had
been stolen, said Lindy Lawrie, a spokeswoman for the Holy
Childhood Convent School in Eshowe.
	   Schreck was born in Gissigheim, Germany, and came to the school
in 1970.

With no NBA stars, world championships wide open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ This was not supposed to be a wide-open
World Basketball Championship.
	   Grant Hill, Gary Payton, Tim Duncan and other NBA stars were
going to lead the latest U.S. Dream Team to another gold medal.
	   But the NBA's labor dispute scrapped all that, and nearly half
of the 16 teams in the championship, which opens Wednesday and ends
Aug. 9, harbor realistic hopes of a medal, maybe gold.
	   Rudy Tomjanovich's U.S. team is an anonymous, workmanlike group
that will need discipline and defense to earn the title that would
have been a sure thing for a crew of NBA stars.
	   Asked for a comparison with the All-Everything squad he was
originally slated to coach, Tomjanovich said, ``It's not close as
far as the talent. ... We have to do it with teamwork and let the
system create opportunities.''
	   USA Basketball initially selected 12 NBA players for the world
championship, but with a lockout looming July 1, the All-Stars
threatened a boycott. USA Basketball moved first, announcing June
16 it was dropping the latest incarnation of the Dream Team.
	   The result is a curious mix of five CBA players, five Americans
playing abroad, one collegian (Duke's Trajan Langdon) and one
player looking for a job.
	   ``We have a lot of players who have played overseas and they
have been helping us with scouting reports,'' said starting point
guard Michael Hawkins, whose own resume reads like a road map.
	   The 6-foot (1.83-meter) guard has played for the NBA's Boston
Celtics, the CBA's Rockford Lightning and Olympiakos of the Greek
League _ all in the past two years.
	   Like his teammates for the next two weeks, Hawkins doesn't have
to worry about what sponsorship deals he might be violating during
an eventual medal ceremony.
	   At the 1992 Olympics, when the Dream Team debuted and hammered
Croatia for the gold, Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan and Charles
Barkley took to the medal stand with American flags draped over
their shoulders _ not an act of unbridled patriotism, but an effort
to hide the Reebok logos on the team warmup suits because of
conflicting commercial endorsements.
	   Tomjanovich, who has guided his Houston Rockets to two NBA
titles, uses words like ``hustle'' and ``unselfish'' a lot when
discussing his charges.
	   For the most part the other 15 countries in the field will not
be represented by NBA talent either, though as among the Americans,
there are castoffs.
	   Australia, bringing the same squad that reached the Goodwill
Games final, does have Dallas Mavericks center Chris Anstey, but
that's about it.
	   Yugoslavia, Russia and Lithuania will challenge even though it
appears none will have their NBA players. Italy gets instant
offense from guard Carlton Myers, who scored 29 points in an 80-75
exhibition loss to Team USA in Rome Saturday night.
	   New Jersey Nets bust Yinka Dare will play for Nigeria, which
also has big bodies in Obinna Ekezie of the University of Maryland,
and Makhtar Ndiaye, who played at North Carolina.
	   Greece chould contend if it gets a lift from home-court
advantage. But organizers had counted on a Dream Team to help sell
tickets, and some local basketball fans may be heading off for
island vacations instead.
	   ``I feel the championship won't be that interesting,'' said
Costas Galerides, a highway engineer from Athens. ``Of course if
the NBA guys were here, nobody else would have a chance.''

Jewish group arrives to examine process against WW II war criminal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SNJEZANA VUKIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A Jewish delegation arrived Monday in
Croatia to observe the government's handling of the case against a
Croatian accused of running the notorious Jasenovac concentration
camp in World War II.
	   Dinko Sakic was extradited in June from Argentina and is in
Zagreb prison while prosecutors prepare a case against him for war
crimes and crimes against humanity.
	   Tens of thousands of Jews, Serbs, Gypsies and anti-Nazi Croats
died at Jasenovac during World War II, when a collaborationist
Croat government supported the Nazis.
	   B'nai B'rith and other Jewish organizations compiled information
about Sakic's alleged role in the deaths, and their efforts led to
his arrest.
	   The delegation from B'Nai B'rith's Anti-Defamation League will
meet with senior Croatian officials to discuss plans for the trial.
Tommy Baer, international director of B'Nai B'rith, told the
Croatian news agency HINA that the Sakic case ``is a chance for
Zagreb to show that today's Croatia has nothing in common with
Croatia in 1940s.''
	   Baser said Sakic is ``perhaps the most important living Nazi war
criminal who hasn't been punished yet for his crimes.'' Baer said
said the case is ``important for the families of the Jasenovac
victims'' and also ``for the credibility of Croatia's legal
state.''
	   The delegation was invited by President Franjo Tudjman, who has
been accused by his political rivals of promoting nationalist
policies reminiscent of the Nazi-era Croatian puppet state.
	   Relations between Israel and Croatia have been chilly for years
following publication of a book in which Tudjman questioned the
number of Jews said to have perished in the Holocaust.
	   In 1994, Tudjman apologized to Jews for their suffering in the
World War II Croatia. He also later changed parts of his book in
its 1997 English-language edition, a move that paved the way for
establishing diplomatic relations with Israel last September.
	   Croatia on Saturday announced that it would request the
extradition of Sakic's wife Nada, who allegedly ran a female block
in the Stara Gradiska camp located near Jasenovac.
	   Nada Sakic was arrested in Argentina on Friday, upon an
extradition request from Yugoslavia. A Yugoslav court has charged
her with genocide.
	   Yugoslavia claims jurisdiction since at the time the alleged
offenses were committed, Croatia was considered by the Western
allies to have been a part of Yugoslavia.

U.N. delegates dig in during fact-finding mission
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ A U.N. delegation on Monday visited
Algiers' Serkadji prison, site of a deadly mutiny two years ago, as
part of its fact-finding mission to this country wracked by
violence for more than six years.
	   The six-member delegation headed by former Portuguese President
Mario Soares has maintained a discrete profile since its arrival
Wednesday on a two-week visit.
	   Military-backed authorities relented to international pressure,
allowing a U.N. mission but with assurances that its job is not to
conduct a full-fledged investigation on the violence that has left
an estimated 70,000 people dead or on human rights abuses.
	   Authorities blame the violence, including numerous massacres, on
Muslim insurgents. But there have been questions as to whether the
military might not have played at least a passive role in some
massacres.
	   Prison visits by outsiders are all but unheard of, meaning the
mission was breaking new ground with its visit to Serkadji, where
nearly 100 people were reported killed in a 1995 mutiny by
prisoners.
	   It was not immediately known whether the delegation met only
with prison officials.
	   After initial meetings with government officials,
representatives of opposition parties and privately-owned newspaper
editors, the delegation appeared to be digging into its task.
	   Over the weekend, delegates met with Armed Forces Chief Gen.
Mohamed Lamari, asking him about how the army was fighting the
insurgency, according to an informed source speaking on condition
of anonymity.
	   ``We're trying to get a complete vision of something that is
immensely complex and immensely difficult in all aspects,'' Soares
told Portuguese radio TSF.
	   Rumors circulated that the mission had met Sunday with leaders
of the banned Islamic Salvation Front.
	   A source close to the Salvation Front claimed Monday that the
U.N. delegation met with the two top leaders of the outlawed party
-- one of whom has been jailed since 1991.
	   The information could not be immediately confirmed.
	   Authorities had indicated before the delegation's arrival that
any meetings with the Salvation Front would not be tolerated.
	   According to the source, who spoke on condition he not be
identified by name, the delegation met on Sunday with Salvation
Front President Abassi Madani and with No. 2 leader Ali Belhadj.
	   Both men were jailed in 1991, but Madani was released a year
ago, then quickly placed under house arrest for urging a dialogue
between authorities and the outlawed party.
	   Belhadj, considered the most popular Muslim fundamentalist
personality in Algeria, remains jailed in an unknown location.
	   Belhadj's fiery sermons contributed to the soaring popularity of
the party in its three years of legal existence.
	   The party was banned in March 1992, two months after the army
canceled legislative elections the Salvation Front was poised to
win -- the move that triggered the insurgency.

Official: Turkey considering purchase of missiles from Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Turkey is considering purchasing Popeye
air-to-ground missiles from Israel, an Israeli defense official
said Monday.
	   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
purchase would be connected to an earlier deal between the two
countries in which Israel Aircraft Industries was awarded a dlrs
632.5 million contract to upgrade 54 Turkish air force F-4 Phantom
jets.
	   The Popeye missiles are produced by Israeli defense contractor
Rafael, which also sells them to the U.S. Air Force,
	   Turkish and Israeli news reports have said that Turkey would buy
Popeye missiles from Israel, but officials have refused to confirm
the reports.
	   Turkey and Israel's growing military ties have angered the Arab
world.
	   The Israeli official denied a report in the Turkish newspaper
Milliyet that visiting Turkish deputy chief-of-staff Gen. Cevik Bir
was discussing the possibility of building medium-range defense
missiles with Israel.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Painting a bleak picture of the
Philippine economy and the cash-strapped government he inherited,
President Joseph Estrada unveiled an austerity program in his first
state-of-the-nation address Monday.
	   ``I won't beat around the bush. We are facing a severe crisis
that is rocking the whole of Asia,'' Estrada said. ``Our economy is
in serious condition and the nation's coffers are threatened.''
	   An earlier draft of the speech distributed to reporters had said
instead that the ``government is bankrupt.''
	   Sniping at claims by the administration of his predecessor,
Fidel Ramos, that the number of poor Filipinos has declined over
the last six years, Estrada said the statistics are meaningless to
ordinary people.
	   ``Poor is poor _ no money, no food, no roof over their heads, no
dignity and especially no hope,'' Estrada said.
	   Estrada, a former actor who often portrayed underdog heroes who
championed the downtrodden, campaigned on a pro-poor platform in
the May 11 election.
	   He said that while the economy is slowing, inflation,
unemployment and crime are rising.
	   Labor productivity is declining as more and more Filipinos are
unable to go to school because the government cannot increase
spending for public education, he said.
	   Estrada said that after 26 years, only 57 percent of land
targeted for distribution in a land reform program has been
distributed and agricultural productivity is also declining.
	   While the budget deficit is ballooning to an estimated 70
billion pesos (dlrs 1.7 billion), corruption and foreign debt
payments continue to drain the government's coffers, he said.
	   Estrada said his administration will continue the economic and
political reforms of his predecessors.
	   ``But we race against time as an impatient public asks us: when
will those reforms pay dividends for the common man?'' he said.
``Well, we just have to begin now. With honesty, with thrift, with
efficiency.''
	   He said he has ordered the withholding of 25 percent of budget
allocations and 10 percent of allotments for local governments, and
urged Congress to abolish its ``pork barrel'' discretionary funds
and postpone military modernization this year.
	   To raise additional revenue, Estrada also asked Congress to pass
a law to privatize the state-run National Power Corp., the largest
Philippine company.
	   He said government shares will be sold in other major
corporations, such as the Philippine National Bank and Petron
Corp., the country's largest oil refiner.
	   To make more funds available for small and medium enterprises,
he said he will reverse the practice of government finance
corporations to allow large companies to corner loans from the
government.
	   He said the current crisis has shown the vulnerability of an
economy when it relies on foreign investment, and urged citizens to
increase their savings to increase domestic capital.
	   Despite spending cuts, Estrada said the government will ensure
continued basic health care and other social services. He indicated
he wants to trim the bureaucracy but did not elaborate.
	   ``My aim is to help our country escape the recession,'' he said.
``My solutions are obvious. My proposals may be commonplace, but
they were never adopted before. In sum, they are to spend wisely
and less.''

The European Commissioner visits Bosnia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The European Foreign Affairs
Commissioner arrived to Sarajevo on Monday to visit projects that
are being jointly implemented by the European Union and the
NATO-led Stabilization Force in Bosnia.
	   Commissioner Hans Van den Broek was invited by NATO-led
Stabilization Force's commander, Eric Shinseki, for this two day
visit which they will spent together visiting several
reconstruction projects financed by their two organizations in both
the Muslim-Croat and the Serb half of the country.
	   Van den Broek will use the opportunity to meet with Bosnian
leaders, as well as with members of the opposition parties, ahead
of the forthcoming nationwide elections in September.
	   Only last week a delegation of the European Parliament completed
its visit to Sarajevo with the goal of examining the financial and
administrative challenges the European Union is facing in its
efforts to aid the people of Bosnia.
	   ``The European Commission representation office plans to launch
between now and the end of the year about 50 tenders for the
approximate value of 106 million ECU (U.S. dollars 120 million)
covering transport, telecommunications, water, agriculture,
housing, energy, health and education,'' the Bosnian news Agency
ONASA quoted Edith Mueller, member of the European Parliament
delegation.
	   The European Union, of which the European Commission is the
executive body, is the major single donor for the reconstruction of
Bosnia.
	   By the end of 1999 it will have spent one billion ECU (U.S.
dollars 1,13 billion) in reconstruction and technical assistance in
Bosnia, as well as further one billion ECU (U.S. dollars 1,13
billion) in humanitarian assistance since 1992.

Father of missing Berlin boy arrested, then released
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The father of a Berlin boy who has been missing
for five years was released from jail Monday, hours after being
arrested for non-payment of court-ordered fines.
	   Rainer Wolf was arrested just before midnight Sunday after
appearing on a German television show about child pornography.
	   Wolf fears his missing son, Manuel Schadwald, fell into the
hands of a Dutch pornography or prostitution ring, although police
say they have found no evidence to support that theory.
	   Wolf vehemently denied on the show that he was involved in his
son's disappearance. A Belgian private detective had made the
charge in a Dutch newspaper over the weekend, only to withdraw it
on the same program with Wolf.
	   Police took Wolf into custody after the show, but said Monday
that the arrest had nothing to do with the missing Manuel.
	   Officials said Wolf had failed to pay two outstanding fines
totaling almost 10,000 marks. One was for defaming a former
business partner; prosecutors declined to give details on the
second fine.
	   Wolf was released from jail after paying the bulk of the money
owed, officials said.

IMF mission begins work in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The chief of Ukraine's central bank said
Monday that talks with an International Monetary Fund delegation
were ``very constructive'' and he was convinced the country would
qualify for a dlrs 2.5 billion loan.
	   The IMF delegation began its work Monday by meeting parliament
speaker Oleksandr Tkachenko. The officials are scheduled to meet
Deputy Prime Minister Serhiy Tyhypko and Finance Minister Ihor
Mityukov before announcing whether Ukraine qualifies for the loan.
	   Many issues have been resolved, ``and now the discussion will
only focus on nuances that would be agreed upon during the talks,''
Yushchenko said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Approval of the loan is crucial for Ukraine, which is heavily in
debt and chronically fails to collect the required budget revenues.
	   Ukraine must repay dlrs 500 million of its dlrs 18 billion
foreign debt in August. The national currency, the hryvna, has been
under pressure in recent months because of an exodus of foreign
investors from the country's financial market.
	   The government has approved dozens of economic reforms since
May, trying to meet requirements set by the IMF.
	   However, a key IMF condition remained unimplemented when
parliament began its summer recess Friday without approving the
1998 budget, which envisages a significant cut in the deficit.
	   Government officials voiced hope that President Leonid Kuchma
would introduce the new budget by decree before the IMF mission is
scheduled to complete its work on Friday.
	   ``We all hope the president will introduce the changes,
otherwise the IMF will refuse the loan,'' Tyhypko, the deputy
premier, said in a television interview on Sunday.
	   Tyhypko said the loan would be used almost entirely to replenish
the National Bank's reserves, which shrank by more than 15 percent
in the last two months due to the need to support the hryvna.
	   He said that cooperation with the IMF would restore foreign
investors' confidence in Ukraine and let the financially struggling
country borrow less expensively abroad.
	   The IMF suspended disbursement of its aid to Ukraine last
spring, citing stalled reforms and excessive state spending. The
move was followed by World Bank's refusal to cooperate with the
former Soviet republic until the IMF aid is resumed.

U.S says world must remain vigilant on Cambodia after election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Countries must remain vigilant and
continue to pressure Cambodia after its election to ensure the
democratic process there continues, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said Monday.
	   ``We have seen the democratic process in Cambodia unravel
before,'' she said a day after the election. ``The real test of
Cambodia's democracy will come after the ballots are counted.''
	   Albright spoke at an international conference in Manila on Asian
security issues called the ASEAN Regional Forum. A Cambodian
representative attended the meetings, in which major Western and
Asian nations participated.
	   ``We must keep the pressure on and stay engaged,'' she said.
``While we cannot impose democracy in Cambodia, we should continue
to encourage it by making our assistance to any government
conditional on respect for international norms.''
	   She said two groups of countries formed last year to work to
encourage a return of political legitimacy in Cambodia _ the
Friends of Cambodia and the ASEAN Troika _ should continue their
work as needed.
	   Countries also should continue efforts to bring to trial those
responsible for the crimes of the Khmer Rouge, she said. More than
a million Cambodians died during the Khmer Rouge's 1975-78 rule.
	   The chairman of the ASEAN Regional Forum, Philippine Foreign
Affairs Secretary Domingo Siazon, said he was satisfied with the
conduct of the election thus far.
	   ``The prevailing assessment of the voting was generally peaceful
and orderly and I share everybody's hope that the next stages of
guarding the ballots, counting and proclamation would also be
peaceful and orderly,'' he said in a statement.
	   The president of the council of the European Union, Austrian
Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel, also pointed to the importance
of the post-election process.
	   He said the EU hopes all political groups in Cambodia will
respect the results of the election. The EU, which helped pay for
the costs of the election, is ready to consider new efforts such as
``an ongoing post-electoral program,'' Schuessel said without
elaborating.

Italy to provide Iran with dlrs 1.2 billion credit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Italy will provide Iran with dlrs 1.2
billion in credit for trade between the two countries, Italian
Minister of Foreign Trade Augusto Fantozzi said here Monday.
	   The credit line is the largest that any European country has
supplied to Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
	   Speaking after a meeting with Iranian Minister of Mines and
Metals, Eshaq Jahangiri, Fantozzi said the Italian bank Mediobanca
would provide the credit to six Iranian, state-controlled banks.
	   The banks are Bank Melli Iran, Bank Sanat Va Madan, Bank Saderat
Iran, Bank Mellat, Bank Sepah and Bank Tejarat.
	   Jahangiri said the agreement provides for cooperation between
the two countries in oil, gas, petrochemicals, industry,
development of power stations, communications and transportation.
	   He said Italy was pleased to be the first European country to
expand economic cooperation with Iran after the resumption of
high-level talks between the Tehran government and the European
Union.
	   Iranian-EU relations were damaged last year after a German court
implicated the Tehran government in the assassination of four
Iranian dissidents in Berlin in 1992. Ties also have been strained
by Iran's 1989 death sentence against the British author Salman
Rushdie over his book ``The Satanic Verses,'' which the Tehran
considers blasphemous.
	   Earlier this month an EU delegation revived the high-level
dialogue with Iran's government during a visit to Tehran.
	   Iran hopes to do more business with Italy, whose trade with Iran
reached dlrs 2.3 billion last year, making it Tehran's
fourth-biggest trading partner. Oil constitutes the bulk of Iranian
exports to Italy.
	   Iran hopes to raise the volume of its non-oil trade with Italy
and to use the country as a platform to increase its non-oil
exports to other European countries.

Four Saudis charged with hunting gazelles in wildlife zone
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A prosecutor on Tuesday charged four Saudi
men with killing gazelles in a protected wildlife area on the Red
Sea, an official in the prosecutor's office said.
	   They were charged under a 1994 law aimed at protecting Egypt's
dwindling wildlife. It has only been applied seriously in the past
year after a campaign by environmentalists and newspapers to end
poaching by hunters from the rich Gulf Arab states.
	   Border patrolmen arrested the four suspects in January in Marsa
Alam, a wildlife protectorate 700 kilometers (435 miles) south of
Cairo, said the official in the prosecutor's office in Hurghada on
the Red Sea.
	   Police found two dead gazelles and quantities of gazelle meat in
a cooler in their four-wheel-drive vehicle, the official said,
speaking under customary condition of anonymity.
	   The four, identified as Khaled Awad, Moemen bin al-Dkheil,
Bandar Abdel-Salam and Khaled Nasr, denied they were hunting. They
were released on a bail of 3,000 Egyptian pounds (dlrs 880) each.
No other information on the men was available.
	   If convicted they face up to three years in prison.
	   No date for the men's trial was set, but the official said they
would be summoned soon.

New Serb government demotes sixteen hard-line media editors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The pro-Western Bosnian
Serb government demoted 16 chief editors of local radio and
television stations, mostly in hard-liners' strongholds, it said
Monday.
	   Angered by the demotions at a government session on Sunday, the
political party loyal to war-time leader Radovan Karadzic, who is
indicted for war crimes by the international tribunal in The Hague,
threatened to boycott Bosnia's general elections scheduled in
mid-September.
	   The government said the reason for firing the editors was a
``breach of public information law ... as well as untimely and
incorrect reports.''
	   It appointed sixteen stand-in editors who will be directly
responsible to the government and will hold the posts ``until the
the media situation is resolved,'' a government statement said.
	   In Doboj, one of the hard-line strongholds 75 kilometers (47
miles) east of the seat of the moderate Bosnian Serb government in
Banja Luka, local authorities have refused to accept the demotions
and called the act ``unconstitutional.''
	   Karadzic loyalists at the Banja Luka branch of his Serbian
Democratic Party demanded an immediate suspension of the
government's decision and threatened to boycott the ballot.
	   The party's vice president, Dragan Cavic, said the demotions
were ``the darkest act of fascism'' and that police had banned
ousted chief editors from entering their stations Sunday night.
	   The reformist Bosnian Serb government was elected last January,
replacing hard-line Karadzic loyalists.
	   It has since received Western support and badly needed
reconstruction aid, which had been denied to its hard-line
predecessors.
	   On a local level, the Bosnian Serb media have, however, remained
plagued by rifts between those supporting the pro-Western
government and those loyal to the hard-liners.
	   In the September elections, the moderate Bosnian Serb leadership
hopes to strengthen its rule and further sideline the influence of
the Karadzic supporters, who control about half of the Bosnian Serb
sub-state.

Japan's vehicle production through June slides
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES 4th-5th grafs with specific company figures &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Production of cars, trucks and buses in Japan
slipped 10.5 percent in this year's first six months, the first
such decline in two years, a Japanese auto industry association
said Monday.
	   Output for January-June fell to 5.1 million vehicles as domestic
demand shrank 15.5 percent to 3.04 million vehicles, the Japan
Automobile Manufacturers' Association said.
	   Sales of cars and other big-ticket items in Japan have been
chilled by a national sales tax increase early last year and a
deterioration in the broader economy.
	   Domestic production at Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's biggest
automaker, decreased 11.4 percent from a year earlier to 1.62
million vehicles in the six-month period, the group said.
	   Nissan Motor Co.'s output shrank 14.5 percent to 775,800
vehicles and Honda Motor Co.'s fell 2.6 percent to 630,424.
Mitsubishi Motors Corp.'s production fell 18 percent to 538,109
vehicles and Mazda Motor Corp.'s declined 4.9 percent to 423,495.
	   The total number of passenger cars manufactured in Japan in the
first six months decreased 8.5 percent to 4.04 million and truck
output slipped 17.7 percent to 1.02 million, the association said.
	   In June alone, overall production dropped 10 percent to 879,211
vehicles _ the ninth straight month of decline.
	   The number of passenger cars made fell 7 percent to 703,978,
while truck output tumbled 20.4 percent to 170,792, the auto group
said.
	   Sales for the month sank 8.9 percent to 507,687 vehicles, it
said.

China says it will keep promise to detarget missiles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATE with Albright-Primakov news conference &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM RAUM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said Monday she told China's foreign minister the United
States was unhappy China was detaining more dissidents in the
aftermath of President Bill Clinton's visit. ``I made ... quite
clear that arresting people is not the way that we see
follow-through,'' she said.
	   Albright made U.S. concerns over human rights in a meeting with
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, one of a series of side
meetings she held during a meeting of Asian nations and their
Pacific Rim neighbors.
	   She also discussed the upcoming summit meeting in Moscow in
September between President Clinton and Russian President Boris
Yeltsin.
	   ``We have a mature partnership now,'' she said of the
U.S.-Soviet relationship. ``We can hit the ground running,'' echoed
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who shared a news
conference podium with her.
	   Albright said high on the agenda of the September meeting would
be nonproliferation issues, the nuclear tests by Iran and Pakistan,
violence in Kosovo and the current financial crisies.
	   For his part, Primakov said Russia would work hard to fight its
way out of its own financial crisis. ``We too will have to swallow
that bitter pill,'' he said.
	   Albright told reporters that she was blunt in an earlier meeting
with the Chinese foreign minister.
	   ``While we both consider, and I especially, one of the major
successes of the president's trip was to raise human rights issues
publicly in China...I did raise our concerns about some of the
recent arrests,'' she said.
	   ``We noted that certain people had been released.But I also made
quite clear that arresting people is not the way that we see follow
through.So I can assure you that subject was raised.''
	   A senior administration official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said that Albright was concerened about the recent
arrests of 20-21 dissidents. The Chinese delegation didn't respond
directly to her concerns but ``they couldn's miss it,'' the
official said.
	   Meanwhile, Tang assured the United States it will follow through
on its pledge to stop targeting the 13 nuclear missiles it has
aimed at U.S. cities, although he did not say when _ or whether it

Officials say King Hussein has undergone chemotherapy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ King Hussein has undergone chemotherapy
treatment at a U.S. hospital, Jordanian officials said Monday.
	   The king's brother, Crown Prince Hassan, said the monarch may
soon leave the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, after initial
treatment but would remain nearby for a ``period of rest.''
	   ``We hope to hear the good results of the first stage of
treatment in the coming two days, and the king will possibly leave
hospital in the coming few days,'' Hassan told Jordanian soldiers
Sunday. His remarks were published by Amman dailies Monday.
	   Officials of the Royal Palace and the government confirmed an
Israeli report that Hussein underwent chemotherapy treatment three
days ago and was responding well.
	   Speaking on customary condition of anonymity, the palace
officials said doctors were awaiting test results to show whether
the king had lymphoma, or cancer of the lymphatic tissue.
	   Hussein disclosed the possibility that he had lymphoma in a
letter to his brother, which was read on Jordanian television last
week.
	   The king is expected to address the Jordanian people Tuesday
about his diagnosis and the results of treatment.
	   Christian churches and Muslim mosques in Jordan held services
during the week to Hussein's recovery and safe return.
	   Hussein was admitted to the clinic July 14 with spells of fever
and cold sweats. He has had regular medical checkups at the clinic
since 1992, when he underwent surgery to remove cancerous tissue
from his ureter and left kidney.
	   He had an inflamed lymph gland removed last November, and in
April 1997, he underwent surgery for an enlarged prostate. Both
were benign.

Swiss Re announces acquisition of U.S. Life Re Corp
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss Reinsurance Co. said Monday it
has reached an agreement to buy U.S. insurer Life Re Corp. for some
dlrs 1.8 billion.
	   Swiss Re is one of the world's leading reinsurers, with gross
premiums in 1997 of some dlrs 11.9 billion.
	   The firm will finance the acquisition of LRE, based in Stamford,
Connecticut, from internal sources, Swiss Re said in a statement.
	   LRE provides traditional life reinsurance and administrative
reinsurance to clients throughout the United States.
	   Its total 1997 revenue was dlrs 646 million with net income at
about dlrs 50 million.
	   Swiss Re said the acquisition advances its strategic goal of
expanding its global life and health reinsurance business.

Government agencies to monitor Thai military arms procurement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's government announced Monday
that all weapons purchases must now be reviewed by two Defense
Ministry committees.
	   For the past five years, the two bodies have been ignored by the
military brass as they concluded several arms deals analysts said
were questionable, including some with outdated and unusable
equipment.
	   Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, who is also the first civilian
defense minister in more than 20 years, ordered the two committees
to once again begin overseeing and reviewing arms procurement
deals, said Akaphol Sorasuchart, the government spokesman.
	   ``This is part of an overall restructuring plan the Ministry of
Defense is currently going through,'' Akaphol said.
	   As in many countries, arms procurement in Thailand is reputed to
be a source of graft, kickbacks and corruption within the military.
One defense analyst, who spoke only on condition of anonymity,
estimated that as much as 40 percent of weapons procurement funds
is pocketed by military brass.
	   Chuan's measures to restructure and professionalize the military
are a bold and risky measure in a country where the army has staged
more than a dozen coup since the end of World War II.
	   The last coup was in 1991. Army Commander-in-Chief Gen. Chetta
Thanajaro has pledged the military will stage no more coups.
	   The two committees _ the armed procurement standard committee
and the defense resource committee _ were first set up in 1993 by
then Defense Minister Gen. Vijit Sookmark, who served under Chuan
in his first term as prime minister from 1992-95.
	   The newspaper Bangkok Post on Monday quoted a Defense Ministry
source as saying the two committees would not only monitor and
screen arms purchases but help trim their cost as well.
	   Thailand is experiencing its worst economic crisis in decades,
forcing the military to accept deep budget cuts, as well as
criticism from a number of lawmakers and others who say military
spending has been too frivolous.
	   The Thai armed forces are struggling to pay off millions of
dollars in foreign debt for weapon purchases.

Spain destroys first batch of antipersonnel mines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CACERES, Spain (AP) _ Spain began destroying its stockpile of
over 800,000 anti-personal landmines Monday, in compliance with
last December's Ottawa treaty.
	   The first three mines were symbolically incinerated at an
explosives factory near this western Spanish city by Defense
Minister Eduardo Serra, ministry spokesman Antonio Castro said.
	   About 1,000 mines are due to pass through the factory's
incinerators every day for over two years at a total cost of over
500 million pesetas (dlrs 3.3 million).
	   A small proportion of the mines will be kept for use in training
exercises, Castro said.
	   An international draft treaty banning the production, export and
use of landmines was signed by 121 nations in Ottawa, Canada last
December.
	   The treaty allowed four years for the destruction of all
stockpiled land mines, and 10 years for the deactivation of
minefields. Serra told reporters that Spain was at ``the vanguard''
of landmine destruction.
	   The ministry is destroying Spanish landmines, leaving a question
mark over what will happen to mines belonging to United States
military bases in Spanish territory, Castro said.
	   The U.S. did not sign the Ottawa treaty and is therefore not
obliged to destroy its own mines, but anti-mine campaigners have
been pressuring signatories to destroy all mines within their
borders.
	   An estimated 100 million antipersonnel mines are deployed in
about 60 countries worldwide, often killing or crippling people
decades after a conflict has ended.

Stewart and Atherton seal win for England
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with result
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Alec Stewart played a no-nonsense
innings Monday to put an eight-wicket victory in the fourth cricket
test against South Africa beyond doubt and claim his first test win
as England captain.
	   In the process, Stewart _ who hit an unbeaten 45 off 34 balls _
denied former skipper Mike Atherton of a well-deserved century but
Atherton managed to hit the winnings runs and was not out 98 when
England posted victory at Trent Bridge.
	   England started the day needing 139 runs to win and with nine
wickets in hand. The home side still needed 55 runs when Nassar
Hussain was out for 58. shortly after lunch when Atherton was on
87.
	   Stewart strode to the crease determined not to let South Africa
make any further breakthroughs. He belted Allan Donald for three
boundaries in one over to signal his intention of sealing a win as
quickly as possible.
	   After being outclassed and outplayed by the South Africans in
the second and third tests, England won by eight wickets and now
has a chance to win the series with one test remaining at Headingly
next week.
	   Atherton and Stewart, England's two form batsmen throughout the
series, ensured England a morale-boosting victory after fast bowler
Angus Fraser laid the groundwork with a 10-wicket match haul.
	   In a test marred by umpiring controversies, mostly against the
South Africans, England's remarkable fight back after conceding a
38-run first innings lead has been completely overshadowed.
	   Atherton, playing his 50th home test, weathered a furious stint
of bowling from Allan Donald on Sunday after New Zealand umpire
Steve Dunn turned down a confident appeal from South Africa for a
caught behind.
	   But Donald failed to intimidate Atherton, who returned to the
wicket Monday in a confident frame of mind.
	   Atherton and Hussain (58) put on a match-winning 152 runs in
four hours before Donald finally seperated the pair, when Jacques
Kallis took a spectacular catch to dismiss Hussain.
	   The second wicket pair brought up the 100-run stand in 164
minutes as the first hour of play realized 38 runs in 15 overs.
	   South African captain Hansie Cronje switched his bowlers around
in desperate search of a breakthrough but a breakthrough was not
forthcoming in the first session.
	   Only once before had England scored more than 240 runs to win a
test at home and that was in 1902, when it scored 262 in the final
innings to beat Australia by one wicket at the Oval.
	   Earlier it was Angus Fraser's bowling which led a remarkable
England fight back, the fast bowler taking his second five-wicket
haul for the match.
	   Fraser followed up his 5-60 in the first innings with 5-60 for a
10-wicket haul, his second this year since his 11-110 against the
West Indies at Port-of-Spain in February.
	   Fraser was an uncertain starter for the match when he was
bracketed with Allan Mullally for one bowling spot but he is
certain to start the next test after two herioc performances _ the
first with the bat to stave off South African victory at Old
Trafford, the second at Trent Bridge with the ball.
	   Apart from a handful of decision that had gone against the South
Africans, soft dismissals in the second innings contributed to a
paltry 208 which set a gettable target for the English.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Djibouti President Hassan Gouled Aptidon
met with his Kenyan counterpart Daniel arap Moi in Nairobi Monday
to discuss the border conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea, the
Foreign Ministry said.
	   ``As neighbors of Ethiopia and Eritrea, Kenya and Djibouti are
gravely concerned with the conflict which is a threat to peace in
the region,'' a joint statement issued by the two leaders said.
	   Aptidon is the current head of the Djibouti-based
Inter-Governmental Authority on Development, a body that seeks to
resolve conflicts in East Africa and the Horn of Africa.
	   Both men said to avoid duplication of efforts, IGAD would wait
for a report from the Organization of African Unity, which is the
main mediator in the Ethio-Eritrean conflict that began in early
May when Eritrean troops moved into border areas claimed by
Ethiopia.
	   The statement said am IGAD heads of state and government would
be convened ``in order to determine further direction on the
conflict'' after the OAU issues its report.
	   Ethiopia and Eritrea are members of IGAD.
	   -----
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo again
called on Eritrea and Ethiopia on Monday to settle their border
dispute quickly.
	   Nzo met Monday with Eritrean Foreign Minister Haile Wedense in
Pretoria and said in a statement that the Eritrean said his country
was ready for an immediate and unconditional cease-fire and direct
negotiations with Ethiopia.
	   South Africa supports an Organization of African Unity
initiative to bring the two sides together for direct talks in
Ougadougou, Burkina Faso, on Aug. 2.
	   -----
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Kruger National Park officials
said Monday they still do not know how many people were killed when
a pride of lions attacked a family from Mozambique trying to cross
the park.
	   The latest attack was discovered when a park ranger found a
dazed girl wandering in the north of the park last week.
	   She said she spent the previous night cowering in a hole,
listening to the screams of her family and the growls of lions. She
said she searched for her family the next morning but found only
her mother's head.
	   Park rangers later found the tracks of two children who
apparently followed a powerline back to Mozambique.
	   A park spokesman told the South African Presss Association it
was still not clear how many people were killed by the lions. He
said there also had been no decision on whether to hunt down and
kill the lions.
	   Lions that kill humans are sometimes shot since they are known
to lose their fear of people.
	   -----
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The government has dropped its
opposition to studying land reform programs in Columbia and Bolivia
and agreed to send a high-level delegation sponsored by the World
Bank, Britain and Denmark.
	   The state-controlled Herald newspaper said Monday that Joseph
Msika, the chairman of the ruling ZANU (PF) party, said the study
tour would take place before the end of the year.
	   The government initially opposed the tour because it felt it
would be an admission the government was not ready for
resettlement, the newspaper said.
	   Msika, who bears the title Minister of State without Portfolio
in the Office of the President was last month given supreme
authority over President Robert Mugabe's plans to takeover 12
million acres of largely white owned commercial farmland for
redistribution to black Zimbabweans.
	   Mugabe continues to make contradictory statements on whether
full compensation rates will be paid.
	   -----
	   MMABATHO, South Africa (AP) _ Police said Monday that 19 people
were killed and 65 injured overnight when a bus and a truck
collided in the Northwest Province.
	   The bus, with 84 passengers aboard, was traveling from Mafiking
to Rustenburg when it collided with the truck carrying wood on a
curve near Zeerrust, about 300 kilometers (185 miles) northwest of
Johannesburg.
	   Police told the South African Press Association that 16 people
were killed immediately when the bus left the road and overturned.
Three others later died at a local hospital of their injuries.
	   The injured included the truck driver and his passenger, who
were later discharged from hospital.
	   No information was immediately available on the condition of the
remaining injured people.
	   -----
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The African Development Bank has granted
Sao Tome and Principe, in West Africa, a loan of dollars 2.5
million to help reduce the two-island nation's striking poverty,
the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported Monday.
	   Sao Tome and Principe, some 300 kilometers (180 miles) off the
coast of Gabon, is one of the world's poorest nations. About 65
percent of the population of 130,000 lives in abject poverty, while
some 50 percent are unemployed.
	   The ADB loan provides cash for the development of small
enterprises and for other measures to boost the country's economic
strife, according to Lusa.
	   The former Portuguese colony's economy _ mainly based on
agriculture and fishing _ slumped since President Miguel Trovoada
was elected in the nation's first democratic elections in 1991.
	   -----
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ A storekeeper, his wife and six children
died of suspected food poisoning after sharing a meal, the Nigerian
News Agency has reported.
	   The man, Malam Sule Oduadu, who worked for the Information
ministry in Lokoja, and his family were taken violently ill minutes
after eating a meal of yam and spinach soup on July 19.
	   Complaining of severe stomach pains, they were rushed to a local
hospital where they died within hours of each other, the Saturday
New Agency report said.
	   Lokoja, about 500 kilometers (310 miles) southeast of Lagos, is
the capital of Kogi state. Oduadu's boss, Information minister Dan
Okolo, told NAN that the state would assist the victims' family
with funeral costs.

India rejects criticism of its nuclear tests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments by Indian official &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos ASEAN 101-120 &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURINDA KEYS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ India on Monday strongly rejected
criticism of its nuclear tests by an international conference on
security in Asia.
	   The ASEAN Regional Forum, which groups the foreign ministers of
20 Asian and Western countries and the European Union, ended its
annual meeting with a statement that ``expressed grave concern over
and strongly deplored the recent nuclear tests in South Asia, which
exacerbated tension in the region and raised the specter of a
nuclear arms race.''
	   India, a member of the forum, dissociated itself from that part
of the statement.
	   The Indian representative, Jaswant Singh, deputy chairman of the
planning commission, said he was sad that ``an organization like
the ARF was subjected to contention when it could easily have been
avoided.''
	   ``The ARF is a singular confidence-building measure, and if it
is a confidence-building measure, contentious issues should be
avoided,'' he said.
	   Singh said the EU also had dissociated itself from an ARF
statement in 1995 that criticized France for its nuclear tests that
year.
	   The tests by India and Pakistan in May were the most heated
issue during the 1 1/2-day forum in Manila.
	   The forum chairman, Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon,
said the language of the joint statement was an attempt to bridge a
divide on the issue.
	   He said some countries argued that the tests should be condemned
because they not only violated the nuclear non-proliferation regime
but also endangered South Asia and the entire world.
	   According to Siazon, other countries said the forum should not
be used to denounce participants.
	   But Singh told a news conference that even the softened language
of the final statement was unacceptable.
	   Pakistan is not a member of the forum, whose members range from
Myanmar to the United States.
	   Singh told the forum that India's nuclear program was entirely
defensive, and aimed at correcting an unfair imbalance in world
nuclear power. India conducted the tests ``to fill a vacuum that
could have resulted in grave and irreparable damage to India's
supreme national interest,'' he said.
	   Other officials said Singh's defense included both the needs of
domestic politics in India and security concerns regarding China.
	   But several countries were disappointed with these arguments.
	   ``There is only one country putting up any defense of India, and
that is India,'' said Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer.
	   He said countries were deeply concerned about how the tests have
challenged the non-proliferation regime, ``which has served the
world so well for the last 30 years.''
	   Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan described the tests as
``plunging South Asia into a sudden wave of tension.''
	   Responding to an Indian questioner at a news conference, Siazon
said: ``If you had stood in the old tradition of Gandhi _ peace,
non-violence _ we would have stood with you all the way.''
	   Siazon said that when non-nuclear states conduct tests, they
tempt other countries to follow suit.

European Commissioner visits Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING FOR ALL NEEDING &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The European Foreign Affairs
Commissioner arrived to Sarajevo on Monday to visit projects that
are being jointly implemented by the European Union and the
NATO-led Stabilization Force in Bosnia.
	   Commissioner Hans Van den Broek was invited by NATO-led
Stabilization Force's commander, Eric Shinseki, for this two day
visit which they will spent together visiting several
reconstruction projects financed by their two organizations in both
the Muslim-Croat and the Serb half of the country.
	   Van den Broek will use the opportunity to meet with Bosnian
leaders, as well as with members of the opposition parties, ahead
of the forthcoming nationwide elections in September.
	   Only last week a delegation of the European Parliament completed
its visit to Sarajevo with the goal of examining the financial and
administrative challenges the European Union is facing in its
efforts to aid the people of Bosnia.
	   ``The European Commission representation office plans to launch
between now and the end of the year about 50 tenders for the
approximate value of 106 million ECU (U.S. dollars 120 million)
covering transport, telecommunications, water, agriculture,
housing, energy, health and education,'' the Bosnian news Agency
ONASA quoted Edith Mueller, member of the European Parliament
delegation.
	   The European Union, of which the European Commission is the
executive body, is the major single donor for the reconstruction of
Bosnia.
	   By the end of 1999 it will have spent one billion ECU (U.S.
dollars 1,13 billion) in reconstruction and technical assistance in
Bosnia, as well as further one billion ECU (U.S. dollars 1,13
billion) in humanitarian assistance since 1992.

TVM officials to face judge as more cyclists admit to taking EPO
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Two top officials of the Dutch team TVM traveled
under police escort Monday to the northern town of Reims for an
appearance before an investigating judge likely to place them under
investigation in the widening Tour de France doping scandal.
	   In the latest chapter of the scandal that is overshadowing the
world's top cycling event, TVM sporting director Cees Priem and
team doctor Andrei Mikhailov risk becoming the center of a lengthy
investigation for allegedly organizing the use of EPO within the
team.
	   The director and doctor of the Festina team are imprisoned for
their roles in the alleged drug use by that team.
	   The TVM officials set out from Foix in southern France for the
long journey to the capital of the Champagne region east of Paris.
They were expected in early evening in Reims.
	   The two officials ``will be put under formal investigation
separately,'' deputy public prosecutor Philippe Laumosne told LCI
news television.
	   The next step would be for other team members to be brought in
for questioning, he said.
	   Rival team Festina has already been expelled from the Tour de
France in connection with the widespread use of the
performance-enhancing drug EPO.
	   But unless TVM officials admit to organizing the use of an
illegal substance, the TVM team will remain in the race.
	   ``I will wait to have more precise details before deciding to
exclude the team,'' Tour Director Jean-Marie Leblanc told French
daily Liberation on Monday. Being charged does not remove the
presumption of innocence, he explained.
	   Meanwhile, a total of five cyclists have now come forward to
admit taking EPO.
	   ``Yes I took EPO. Caught up in the whole business, I took it for
three years under strict medical supervision. But I never abused
it,'' Swiss Festina member Laurent Dufaux was quoted Monday by the
Swiss daily Le Matin as saying.
	   ``I hope that those who have come clean will not be the only
ones who have to carry the can,'' said Dufaux, who added he felt
there was a danger the issue could end up being swept under the
carpet.
	   ``I am afraid people will put a lid over the five who have
confessed, that they will be sanctioned and that nothing will
change.''
	   Countrymen Alex Zulle and Armin Meier are among others who
admitted to taking the drug, but Richard Virenque, Pascal Herve and
Didier Rous of France and Australian Neil Stephens still deny any
wrongdoing.
	   Tour officials continue to reject calls to cancel the race.
	   ``There is no question of stopping the Tour,'' Leblanc said in
the interview with Liberation.
	   But he admitted to fearing the worst Friday when cyclists
refused for two hours to start the race.
	   ``For 15 minutes, I thought that the Tour was going to stop by
itself. If the riders had persisted, if the stage had not begun, I
would have thought differently. The Tour would have definitely
broken down. But stopping it myself, no,'' he told the newspaper.

Polish tractor factory denies report it bribed Pakistani leaders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Officials at the Ursus tractor factory
denied allegations Monday that the company paid a dlrs 2.6 million
bribe to former Pakistani leader Benazir Bhutto to win a dlrs 33
million export deal.
	   The nationwide Rzeczpospolita daily reported Monday that in
1994, Ursus paid the 8 percent commission on the deal to a Swiss
bank account belonging to Ms. Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali Zardari.
	   Company spokesman Krzysztof Baczek told Radio Zet that the deal
to sell 8,000 tractors to Pakistan was carried out in 1994-95 by
the previous management.
	   The current management, he said, ``has no knowledge about any
kind of financial gratuity handed to anyone in connection with
concluded contracts.''
	   Ursus' chairman at the time of the deal, Janusz Sciskalski,
denied making any bribe. But he refused to discuss terms of the
contract, saying it was confidential.
	   Baczek pointed out that Ursus finances were reviewed by a
government agency last year and no irregularities were found.
	   However, a spokesman for the Supreme Chamber of Control said the
review did not cover all Ursus finances, but only how the ailing
company was using government subsidies.
	   Ms. Bhutto's husband has been in jail since her government was
dismissed in November 1996 on charges of corruption and ineptitude.
	   Earlier this month, a Swiss court indicted Zardari on charges of
money laundering and said it was clearing up details before
charging Ms. Bhutto herself.
	   A court in Karachi, Pakistan, granted Ms. Bhutto three weeks
Monday to defend herself against corruption charges at the next
hearing.

EU investigates eight European telecom operators
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union said Monday it will
launch a full investigation into mobile telephone fees charged by
eight European fixed telecommunications network operators.
	   The companies are Belgium's Belgacom, Ireland's Telecom Eireann,
British Telecommunications PLC, P and T Austria, Spain's
Telefonica, KPN Telecom of the Netherlands, Telecom Italia and
Germany's Deutsche Telekom.
	   The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said a
preliminary investigation shows the companies could be charging
excessive prices well over a benchmark set by the EU. But EU
official Stefan Rating said the investigation does not represent a
legal action against the companies.
	   ``This is to increase attention on this issue. We want to get
some eyebrows knitted and get some kind of reaction,'' Rating said.
``We will take account of changes introduced during the
investigation.''
	   He the Commission could take further action the findings
warrant.
	   The Commission will examine what these companies charge mobile
telephone operators on mobile-to-fixed telephone calls and
fixed-to-mobile telephone calls, compared to what other operators
are charged.

<TEXT>
	   CALCUTTA, India (AP) _Mother Teresa's successor left for Yemen
Monday immediately after learning of the killing of three nuns
belonging to the missionary order in the Red Sea city of Hodeida, a
spokeswoman said.
	   Reports from Yemen said the three nuns, two Indians and one
Filipino, were shot as they left their clinic by gunmen armed with
automatic rifles. One person has been arrested but the suspect has
not been identified.
	   Mother Teresa's successor, Sister Nirmala, flew from Calcutta to
visit the Hodeida clinic on Tuesday, said Sister Christie,
spokeswoman of the Missionaries of Charity in Calcutta.
	   Sister Christie did not give details of the deaths. ``Please
pray for them and their families,'' she said.
	   She said she was not aware if there had been any attacks on nuns
from the order in the past. She had no details of funeral
arrangements.
	   The Missionaries of Charity planned a special prayer for the
victims Monday evening.

More than 300 Thai fishing boats block commercial port
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ More than 300 small fishing boats
blockaded a port in southern Thailand Monday to back demands that
the government stop large commercial trawlers from fishing within
three kilometers (1.8 miles) of the coast.
	   Their crews refused to allow commercial trawlers to enter or
leave the main port of Songkhla province, 950 kilometers (590
miles) south of Bangkok. They say the large trawlers are depleting
fish stocks and leaving small fishermen with no livelihood.
	   The blockade has been going on for three days.
	   The protesters demanded that Minister of Agriculture Pongpol
Adireksarn talk to them directly and refused to meet with
provincial officials, saying only the minister has the power to
solve the problem.
	   Disputes between commercial fishing companies and small
fishermen have intensified in recent months.
	   In June, more then 1,000 Thai fishermen and workers from
commercial trawlers battled each other with rocks, bottles and
sticks in a similar dispute in Krabi province, 550 kilometers (342
miles) south of Bangkok on the coast of the Andaman Sea.
	   The small fishermen want the government to triple the size of a
conservation area from which deep-sea trawlers are banned but small
craft are not. The small fishermen say the trawlers are already
intruding into the current conservation territory.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES reaction from local leaders; no pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Police on Monday were searching for
the killers of a German nun, whose body was found in a rural area
north of this coastal city five days after she disappeared.
	   Sister Theodelind Schreck, 57, principal of a school in Eshowe,
was found face down in the woods near a road Sunday. She apparently
suffered a gunshot wound, police said.
	   Police believe the motive was robbery, said spokesman Bala
Naidoo.
	   Local leaders expressed shock at the killing.
	   ``Sister Theodelind Schreck was dedicated to her teaching and
religious duties,'' said Ben Ngubane, premier of KwaZulu-Natal
province. ``Violence remains violence, irrespective of
motivation,'' Ngubane said.
	   The Roman Catholic nun disappeared on Wednesday after dropping
off her nephew at a nearby mission. She was on her way back to
Eshowe, near the Indian Ocean coast and about 130 kilometers (80
miles) north of Durban.
	   Her car had been found in a poor area outside the city. In it
were the nun's identification document; a tire and the radio had
been stolen, said Lindy Lawrie, a spokeswoman for the Holy
Childhood Convent School in Eshowe.
	   Schreck was born in Gissigheim, Germany, and came to the school
in 1970.

With no NBA stars, world championship wide open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS graf 16 to CORRECT Ndiaye from Senegal. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ This was not supposed to be a wide-open
World Basketball Championship.
	   Grant Hill, Gary Payton, Tim Duncan and other NBA stars were
going to lead the latest U.S. Dream Team to another gold medal.
	   But the NBA's labor dispute scrapped all that, and nearly half
of the 16 teams in the championship, which opens Wednesday and ends
Aug. 9, harbor realistic hopes of a medal, maybe gold.
	   Rudy Tomjanovich's U.S. team is an anonymous, workmanlike group
that will need discipline and defense to earn the title that would
have been a sure thing for a crew of NBA stars.
	   Asked for a comparison with the All-Everything squad he was
originally slated to coach, Tomjanovich said, ``It's not close as
far as the talent. ... We have to do it with teamwork and let the
system create opportunities.''
	   USA Basketball initially selected 12 NBA players for the world
championship, but with a lockout looming July 1, the All-Stars
threatened a boycott. USA Basketball moved first, announcing June
16 it was dropping the latest incarnation of the Dream Team.
	   The result is a curious mix of five CBA players, five Americans
playing abroad, one collegian (Duke's Trajan Langdon) and one
player looking for a job.
	   ``We have a lot of players who have played overseas and they
have been helping us with scouting reports,'' said starting point
guard Michael Hawkins, whose own resume reads like a road map.
	   The 6-foot (1.83-meter) guard has played for the NBA's Boston
Celtics, the CBA's Rockford Lightning and Olympiakos of the Greek
League _ all in the past two years.
	   Like his teammates for the next two weeks, Hawkins doesn't have
to worry about what sponsorship deals he might be violating during
an eventual medal ceremony.
	   At the 1992 Olympics, when the Dream Team debuted and hammered
Croatia for the gold, Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan and Charles
Barkley took to the medal stand with American flags draped over
their shoulders _ not an act of unbridled patriotism, but an effort
to hide the Reebok logos on the team warmup suits because of
conflicting commercial endorsements.
	   Tomjanovich, who has guided his Houston Rockets to two NBA
titles, uses words like ``hustle'' and ``unselfish'' a lot when
discussing his charges.
	   For the most part the other 15 countries in the field will not
be represented by NBA talent either, though as among the Americans,
there are castoffs.
	   Australia, bringing the same squad that reached the Goodwill
Games final, does have Dallas Mavericks center Chris Anstey, but
that's about it.
	   Yugoslavia, Russia and Lithuania will challenge even though it
appears none will have their NBA players. Italy gets instant
offense from guard Carlton Myers, who scored 29 points in an 80-75
exhibition loss to Team USA in Rome Saturday night.
	   New Jersey Nets bust Yinka Dare will play for Nigeria, which has
another big body in Obinna Ekezie of the University of Maryland.
Makhtar Ndiaye, who played at North Carolina, will be a bright spot
for outsider Senegal.
	   Greece could contend if it gets a lift from home-court
advantage. But organizers had counted on a Dream Team to help sell
tickets, and some local basketball fans may be heading off for
island vacations instead.
	   ``I feel the championship won't be that interesting,'' said
Costas Galerides, a highway engineer from Athens. ``Of course if
the NBA guys were here, nobody else would have a chance.''

Israeli jet fighter crashes in West Bank; two injured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TARKOUMIYA, West Bank (AP) _ An Israeli air force Skyhawk jet
fighter crashed during a training exercise Monday in the West Bank,
the army said.
	   A pilot and student pilot ejected from the plane before the
crash and were slightly injured, the army said. The army said the
crash was caused by unspecified ``technical problems'' and was
being investigated.
	   The plane crashed into a wheat field in the village of
Tarkoumiya, 10 kilometers west of Hebron, and broke into dozens of
pieces. Army officers searched the field while crowds of
Palestinians looked on.
	   The village is in the 70 percent of the West Bank still under
full Israeli control.
	   Israel Radio said the army uses the Skyhawk fighters to train
pilots.

	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ A set of Chilean quintuplets born over
the weekend were doing very well Monday and breathing without
difficulty.
	   The private Las Condes Clinic said the three boys and two girls
were born Sunday through a cesarean operation after a 31-week
pregnancy. Their weights ranged from 1.19 to 1.30 kilograms (2.62
to 2.87 pounds).
	   ``According to the head doctor, the children are doing very well
and have not required breathing aid,'' the clinic said in a brief
communique.
	   The parents were identified as Rodrigo Oporto and Claudia
Ciudad, both 30-year-old psychologists.
	   The children were named Diego Andres, Pedro Pablo, Abril
Monserrat, Daniela Constanza and Hugo Alejandro.
	   The clinic did not immediately say whether the mother had taken
fertility treatment.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Italian Premier Romano Prodi and Turkish
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz held talks here Monday on Ankara's
difficult relations with the European Union, Greece and Cyprus.
	   ``I suggested a few concrete points that may help Ankara come
closer to Brussels,'' Prodi told reporters before boarding a boat
with Yilmaz for a cruise on the Bosporus strait that separates
Istanbul's European and Asian shores.
	   Ankara put its relations with the 15-member union on hold in
December when the EU decided to exclude Turkey from the initial
round of enlargement talks because of its poor human rights record
and its ongoing disputes with EU-member Greece.
	   Yilmaz said Turkey expected the EU to make the next move.
	   Italy -- along with Britain, France, and Spain -- are reported
to have pressed their EU partners for more favorable treatment of
Turkey.
	   ``I have always felt that Ankara was close to Brussels,'' Prodi
said on his one-day visit.
	   The two leaders also discussed bilateral relations and trade.
	   Italy is Turkey's second largest trade partner. Trade volume
between the two countries is estimated at dlrs 5.7 billion.
	   Several projects of joint cooperation for investments in Central
Asia are reportedly under discussion.

Arafat wants EU help to get peace process moving
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Palestinian President Yasser Arafat
appealed Monday for the European Union to help get the stalled
Middle East peace process unstuck.
	   ``We need European and American pressure to get Israel to the
negotiating table,'' Arafat said during a joint press conference
with Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima.
	   Austria currently holds the EU presidency, and Arafat arrived
Monday on a one-day visit to the capital, Vienna, where he met with
Klima, President Thomas Klestil, and other government officials.
	   Klima promised Austria would do everything in its power to get
Palestine and Israel to accept the most recent American peace
initiative as quickly as possible.
	   ``It is necessary for the security of this region (the Middle
East) and it is necessary for the security of Europe,'' Klima said.
	   Klima said the EU and Austria are ready to offer economic
support because a battle against ``poverty, radicalism and
political violence'' is necessary to ensure peace and stability.
	   Last week, Arafat called off talks between Palestinian and
Israeli negotiators until Israel accepts an American peace
proposal.
	   At issue is a plan for Israel to gradually withdraw troops from
13 percent of the West Bank, while Palestine cracks down on Islamic
militants.
	   While Palestine has accepted the U.S. plan, Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has balked at the scope of the pullback
and has demanded stronger Palestinian security guarantees.
	   Although the two sides are now at loggerheads, Arafat said,
``peace is a very noble target and we have to work very hard to
achieve it.''
	   Arafat said he welcomed a proposal by Egypt and France to hold a
new international conference on the Middle East.
	   After his meetings in Vienna, Arafat heads to Paris to meet with
French President Jacques Chirac.

Russia praises Cambodia elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's foreign ministry said Monday that
parliamentary elections in Cambodia will help the Southeast Asian
country create a more democratic society.
	   Although Sunday's elections saw 10 people killed in violence by
Khmer Rouge revolutionaries and minor irregularities in the
ballot-counting process, ``it was the first occasion in history
when the Cambodians arranged an event of such dimensions,'' a
Foreign Ministry statement said.
	   The elections were monitored by 500 observers from 30 countries,
including Russia. Preliminary results were expected later Monday.
	   Cambodia has been plagued by violence for years, and experts
fear that election results could lead to further fighting if
opposing factions vying for seats in the parliament do not make
efforts to negotiate a sound power-sharing agreement.

ASEAN says economic monitoring system not abandoned
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The start of a pioneering scheme for
Southeast Asian countries to mutually monitor each of their
economies has been delayed, but the early-warning system to avert
future crises in the region isn't being abandoned, an official said
Monday.
	   Nine months after finance ministers of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations endorsed a mutual surveillance system to
exchange and review economic data, the scheme is still just a
blueprint.
	   There is little prospect of getting the plan off the ground
until ASEAN governments can agree on the sensitive issue of what
type of data will be shared.
	   ASEAN Secretary-General Rodolfo Severino acknowledged that
implementing the surveillance system was taking longer than
expected but said the group is still committed to it.
	   At a meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers over the weekend,
Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said some ASEAN members
found the data being requested was too ``intrusive'' and
``private.''
	   Siazon did not name the ASEAN members balking at the prospect of
sharing data among the group, although Malaysia is reportedly among
them.
	   ASEAN comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
	   Under the plan, the Manila-based Asian Development Bank is to
oversee the operations of the surveillance system for two years
before it moves to ASEAN's secretariat in Kuala Lumpur.
	   The exact role of the ADB's involvement also has not been worked
out.
	   ``We're pushing (for the surveillance mechanism). It's not dead
_ it's alive but delayed,'' Severino said.
	   Severino stressed that while it was important to quickly
implement the surveillance system, it wasn't a quick fix for the
region's year-old financial crisis.
	   ASEAN foreign ministers closed their 31st annual meeting
Saturday. Their joint communique gave political backing to the
measures adopted by ASEAN's finance ministers to deal with the
region's financial crisis, but no new solutions were offered.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian officials postponed the
release Monday of preliminary results from parliamentary elections,
raising fears that the overnight delay could allow tampering with
the figures in favor of strongman Hun Sen.
	   More than 90 minutes after the results from Sunday's vote were
due to be announced, election officials told a meeting room packed
with party activists, journalists and human rights workers that
incomplete documents and communications problems had forced a delay
until Tuesday morning.
	   ``These results are not clear enough to be released,'' said
Samraing Kimsain, spokesman of the National Election Committee,
which is dominated by Hun Sen supporters. ``We want to wait for
more clear information and hope to release the results tomorrow,
step by step.''
	   The three major parties each claimed sweeping victories
throughout the day as members reported results from various
locations, but the violence-marred election campaign and Hun Sen's
steps to pack key agencies with his backers had long raised
expectations that come the election, the final figures would show
victory for his Cambodian People's Party.
	   ``I think I have to wait for the results, but the delay makes me
nervous,'' said Lu Laysreng, a candidate for the opposition
FUNCINPEC party headed by Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who was deposed
as co-prime minister by Hun Sen's troops in pitched street battles
a year ago.
	   The other main opposition party leader, former Finance Minister
Sam Rainsy, had said earlier that the Cambodian People's Party was
the clear loser in the election, according to results that his
workers had obtained as ballots were slowly counted throughout the
day.

Police officer killed in Karachi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ A Pakistani police officer was killed
Monday by unidentified gunmen in Karachi, a day after two soldiers
were killed in the troubled Pakistan port city.
	   Police said that Head Constable Abdul Qadir was shot as he rode
a motorbike in Karachi's 5-D area, the news agency Associated Press
of Pakistan reported. Qadir was in civilian clothes.
	   On Sunday, two off-duty soldiers disappeared from a market and
were later found in a Karachi cemetery with their hands tied behind
their backs and bullet wounds in their heads. One was found dead
and the second died later in a hospital.
	   Police portrayed the soldiers' killings as reprisals for a
crackdown over the last 10 days in which paramilitary troops have
arrested more than 500 people in Karachi's Liaqatabad neighborhood.
Police did not say which of Liaqatabad's two main factions was
believed responsible.
	   The paramilitary troops are trying to quell fighting between the
Mohajir Quami Movement and a breakaway faction that has left more
than 250 dead in the last six weeks. The MQM, which is a member of
Pakistan's governing coalition, represents Muslims who moved to
officially Islamic Pakistan from predominately Hindu India when the
two independent countries were carved out of one British colony in
1947.
	   Militants among Mhajirs, as Muslims from India are known, claim
they are discriminated against and years ago turned to violence to
press their demands to be treated the same as Pakistan-born
Muslims. Various Mohajir factions soon began fighting each other
for power, plunging Karachi into near-anarchy.

Duma's panel considers long-shot impeachment motion against
</HEADLINE>
Yeltsin &QL;

grafs 10-11. TRIMS pvs. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin's parliamentary foes debated on
Monday his role in the collapse of the Soviet Union in their search
for legal grounds to support a impeachment motion against the
Russian president.
	   Several previous attempts to oust Yeltsin have failed, and this
initiative is expected to meet the same fate. But the process begun
by hard-liners in the lower house of parliament, the State Duma,
could erode the government's authority and strengthen the
Communist-led opposition.
	   The parliamentary commission assigned to draw up formal charges
against Yeltsin began listening Monday to Communist lawmakers who
have accused the president of several transgressions.
	   They blamed Yeltsin for instigating the collapse of the Soviet
Union by signing a December 1991 agreement with Ukraine and Belarus
declaring the Soviet Union defunct. The agreement created the
Commonwealth of Independent States, a loose coalition of former
Soviet republics.
	   Two prominent Communist lawmakers, Viktor Ilyukhin and Anatoly
Lukyanov, who sponsored the impeachment motion, said Yeltsin's
action amounted to high treason because Russia lost much its wealth
and military might in the Soviet collapse.
	   ``Boris Nikolayevich (Yeltsin) has never cared for the country,
only for his own power,'' Ilyukhin said.
	   Yeltsin and other government officials have repeatedly said that
the Soviet breakup was imminent, precipitated by the botched August
1991 hard-line coup against Mikhail Gorbachev and the virtual
collapse of the Soviet economy.
	   Supporters of the impeachment motion also accuse Yeltsin of
launching the botched war in Chechnya, ruining Russia's economy and
military, and using troops and tanks against his foes in the former
Russian parliament in October 1993.
	   Yeltsin has ignored the parliamentary commission and did not
send a representative to take part in its work Monday.
	   The commission's Communist chairman, Vadim Filimonov, said he
would send the president a detailed account of Monday's hearings
and again invite him to take part when the panel meets again on
Aug. 17.
	   The panel will ask former Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk
and former Belarusian leader Stanislav Shushkevich _ who signed the
December 1991 agreement with Yeltsin declaring the Soviet Union
defunct _ to testify, Filimonov said.
	   Even the authors of the impeachment motion acknowledged it was
unlikely to succeed.
	   ``I don't think that we have a strong chance,'' said Lukyanov,
who was one of Gorbachev's closest friends and advisers, and served
as one of the last speakers of the Soviet parliament. ``We don't
have any illusions.''
	   Russia's constitution gives the president a strong hand in
confrontations with parliament and the constitution is vague on the
grounds for which a president can be impeached, citing only treason
and grave misconduct.
	   A two-thirds majority in parliament's lower house would be
needed to formally launch an impeachment motion.
	   The motion then would require confirmation from both the
Constitutional and Supreme Courts, as well as the upper chamber of
parliament, the Federation Council consisting of regional leaders
most of whom are usually loyal to Yeltsin.

Turkish, US officials push for Caspian oil and gas pipelines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish and U.S. officials were set to
leave Monday on a joint mission to Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan to
lobby for oil and gas pipelines across the Caspian Sea to Turkey,
the foreign minister said.
	   Both countries have been campaigning for an oil pipeline running
from Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, through Georgia to the Turkish
Mediterranean port of Ceyhan, as well as a pipeline to carry
Turkmen natural gas across the Caspian Sea to Turkey.
	   The projects are among a number of proposed pipelines for
transporting oil and gas in the region.
	   President Clinton's adviser for the former Soviet republics,
Richard Morningstar, will carry messages from Clinton to the
leaders of Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan, Turkey's Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem told reporters.
	   The United States favors pipeline routes to Turkey because of
its strong opposition to any plans to transport Caspian Sea oil and
gas to markets through Iran, a country which Washington considers
unreliable.

Free trade area in South Asia likely to be delayed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ASHOK SHARMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Tense relations between India and
Pakistan are likely to prevent the seven South Asian nations from
reaching its target of a free trade zone in the next three years,
officials said Monday.
	   A three-day summit of the seven heads of government will
consider a recommendation to extend the deadline by at least five
years, said the officials on condition of anonymity. The meeting
opens Wednesday.
	   The South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation also
comprises Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan and the Maldives.
For nearly 13 years, the members have tried unsuccessfully to put
their mutual suspicions aside and become a significant trading
bloc.
	   The seven countries are home to one-fifth of the world's
population and 40 percent of its poorest people.
	   The 10th SAARC summit will be overshadowed by a meeting on the
sidelines between the prime ministers of India and Pakistan, their
first since their nations conducted nuclear tests last May and
declared themselves nuclear weapon states.
	   On Sunday, the foreign secretaries of the two countries met
informally in the Sri Lankan capital to prepare for Wednesday's
talks between Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee of India and
Pakistan's Nawaz Sharif that are likely to focus on the nuclear
issue and the territorial dispute over the Himalayan territory of
Kashmir.
	   Official trade between the two nations last year was 6.7 billion
rupees (dlrs 160 million), bolstered by a dlrs 1.5 billion
unofficial trade using indirect routes via Dubai and Afghanistan.
	   For the economies of the region to be integrated, countries must
promote freer travel by relaxing visa restrictions, providing
better telecommunications, roads and more flights, said Indian
economist S. Sen.
	   Last year, India, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal formed a
sub-group, calling themselves the ``growth quadrangle.'' India
worked out separate agreements on sharing water and power with
Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh.
	   Top foreign ministry officials from the four countries met in
the Nepalese capital earlier this month and said that the
subregional approach was necessary to achieve faster cooperation in
areas such as trade, commerce, generation and transfer of power and
harnessing the region's vast natural resources.
	   The formation of the quadrangle outraged Sri Lanka and Pakistan,
which feared they were being excluded.

China demands U.S. Congress respect claim to Taiwan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS comments on trade change, grafs 7-9 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China demanded Monday that the U.S. Congress
respect Beijing's claim over Taiwan and stop passing resolutions
reaffirming American support for the island.
	   ``We demand that members of the U.S. Congress strictly comply
with the `one China' policy, cease all interference in China's
domestic affairs and refrain from hampering further improvements in
Sino-U.S. relations by using the Taiwan issue,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Tang Guoqiang was quoted as saying by the official Xinhua
News Agency.
	   Tang's comments marked the second time in two weeks he has
criticized the House of Representatives for passing a resolution on
July 20 that promised to continue U.S. arms sales to the island and
called for it to become a member of the World Bank and other
international bodies.
	   Always prickly over perceived foreign interference in its
domestic affairs, China saves its harshest invective for Taiwan's
campaign to win recognition abroad and any foreign backing for that
effort.
	   Congress exhibited ``total disregard for norms guiding
international relations'' and the resolution ``seriously infringed
on China's national sovereignty and wantonly interfered in the
nation's internal affairs,'' Tang was quoted as saying.
	   He earlier denounced the Senate for adopting a similar statement
and accused supporters of the resolutions of plotting to sabotage
warming relations between Washington and Beijing.
	   Tang also reiterated a call for the U.S. government to make
extension of normal trading terms to China permanent and abolish
the annual debate on renewal. China considers the debate a China
bashing forum and says it strains relations between the two
countries.
	   But Tang said China welcomed a change in the designation of the
trade terms from most-favored-nation to normal trade relations. The
change, described by Tang as a ``wise and practical move,'' was
instituted on July 22, the same day China's trade status was
renewed.
	   Congress made the change to reflect the reality that the United
States extends those terms to all but six countries.
	   Members of Congress believed the show of support for Taiwan was
necessary after U.S. President Bill Clinton made statements in
China seen as tilting toward Beijing. Clinton said Washington did
not support an independent Taiwan nor its entry into organizations
of sovereign states.
	   Although the sides have been united for just four of the past
100 years, China continues to claim Taiwan as a renegade province
to be reunited with the mainland by force if necessary.
	   Taiwan is governed by the Nationalists, who fled to the island
after being swept off the mainland by Communist Party-led forces in
1949.

France, Egypt discuss plan to rekindle Mideast peace process
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Monday
France and Egypt had tackled issues of ``extreme importance''
concerning a possible conference on the Middle East peace process.
	   French President Jacques Chirac and Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak in May urged holding an international conference to get the
peace process back on track.
	   The Franco-Egyptian initiative is a sign of how much France
wants to play a role in the peace process which has stalled under
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government.
	   Moussa discussed the Franco-Egyptian plan in talks in Paris on
Monday with his French counterpart Hubert Vedrine.
	   But Moussa, speaking at a news conference, warned: ``Netanyahu's
position hasn't changed.''
	   Vedrine said Monday's talks showed that Egypt and France
``shared the same principles and the same same ideas.''
	   Vedrine and Moussa will hold further talks on the possible
conference Tuesday.
	   The peace process also will be discussed by Arab and Islamic
countries participating in a meeting of the Jerusalem Committee (Al
Qods) of the Organization of the Islamic Conference in Casablanca,
Morocco.
	   Moussa is among foreign ministers who will attend the meetings
July 29-30. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is also expected to
attend the meeting as well as visit France this week.
	   Earlier Monday, Moussa said before leaving Cairo that Arab
countries and the international community accepted the idea of an
international conference.

Ericsson's pretax profits up, but markets disappointed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Telecommunications giant LM Ericsson AB
on Monday reported a half-year pretax profit of 7.57 billion kronor
(dlrs 952 million), a 25 percent increase from the same period a
year ago.
	   Despite the rise and despite the profit being slightly higher
than expected, Ericsson's shares fell 7.4 percent on the Stockholm
bourse after the report because its figures revealed disappointing
mobile phone sales for the second quarter of the year.
	   In the second quarter, its mobile phones sales were almost flat
at 10.83 billion kronor (dlrs 1.36 billion), compared with 10.76
billion kronor a year ago. In contrast, Ericsson's Finnish rival
Nokia last week announced a 50 percent second-quarter increase in
mobile phone sales.
	   Ericsson's chief executive, Sven-Christer Nilsson, also said he
foresees a continued strong downward pressure on the group's
products, especially on terminals, but for the first half margins
were better than last year.
	   Sales of cellular systems grew 20 percent in the first half
while the Infocom business area reported a 4 percent sales gain,
but the Asian economic crisis significantly hurt demand, the
company said.
	   Sales to Asia, excluding China, have dropped by 27 percent in
the first half compared with 1997, which means lost sales of
between 4 to 5 billion kronor (dlrs 500 to 625 million), Ericsson
said.

Jewish group arrives to examine prosecution of WW II war criminal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SNJEZANA VUKIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A Jewish delegation arrived Monday in
Croatia to observe the prosecution of a Croatian accused of running
the notorious Jasenovac concentration camp during World War II.
	   Dinko Sakic was extradited in June from Argentina and is in
Zagreb prison while prosecutors prepare a case against him for war
crimes and crimes against humanity.
	   Tens of thousands of Jews, Serbs, Gypsies and anti-Nazi Croats
died at Jasenovac during World War II, when a collaborationist
Croat government supported the Nazis.
	   B'nai B'rith and other Jewish organizations compiled information
about Sakic's alleged role in the deaths, and their efforts led to
his arrest.
	   The delegation from B'Nai B'rith's Anti-Defamation League will
meet with senior Croatian officials to discuss plans for the trial.
Tommy Baer, international director of B'Nai B'rith, told the
Croatian news agency HINA that the Sakic case ``is a chance for
Zagreb to show that today's Croatia has nothing in common with
Croatia in 1940s.''
	   Baser said Sakic is ``perhaps the most important living Nazi war
criminal who hasn't been punished yet for his crimes.'' Baer said
the case is ``important for the families of the Jasenovac victims''
and also ``for the credibility of Croatia's legal state.''
	   The delegation was invited by President Franjo Tudjman, who has
been accused by his political rivals of promoting nationalist
policies reminiscent of the Nazi-era Croatian puppet state.
	   Relations between Israel and Croatia have been chilly for years
following publication of a book in which Tudjman questioned the
number of Jews said to have perished in the Holocaust.
	   In 1994, Tudjman apologized to Jews for their suffering in
wartime Croatia. He also later changed parts of his book in its
1997 English-language edition, a move that paved the way for
establishing diplomatic relations with Israel last September.
	   Croatia announced Saturday that it would request the extradition
of Sakic's wife Nada, who allegedly ran a female block in the Stara
Gradiska camp located near Jasenovac.
	   Nada Sakic was arrested in Argentina on Friday, on an
extradition request from Yugoslavia. A Yugoslav court has charged
her with genocide.
	   Yugoslavia claims jurisdiction since at the time the alleged
offenses were committed, Croatia was considered by the Western
allies to have been a part of Yugoslavia.

Arafat wants EU help to get peace process moving
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Palestinian President Yasser Arafat
appealed Monday for the European Union to help get the stalled
Middle East peace process unstuck.
	   ``We need European and American pressure to get Israel to the
negotiating table,'' Arafat said during a joint press conference
with Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima.
	   Austria currently holds the EU presidency, and Arafat arrived
Monday on a one-day visit to the capital, Vienna, where he met with
Klima, President Thomas Klestil, and other government officials.
	   Klima promised Austria would do everything in its power to get
Palestine and Israel to accept the most recent American peace
initiative as quickly as possible.
	   ``It is necessary for the security of this region (the Middle
East) and it is necessary for the security of Europe,'' Klima said.
	   Klima said the EU and Austria are ready to offer economic
support because a battle against ``poverty, radicalism and
political violence'' is necessary to ensure peace and stability.
	   Last week, Arafat called off talks between Palestinian and
Israeli negotiators until Israel accepts an American peace
proposal.
	   At issue is a plan for Israel to gradually withdraw troops from
13 percent of the West Bank, while Palestine cracks down on Islamic
militants.
	   While Palestine has accepted the U.S. plan, Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has balked at the scope of the pullback
and has demanded stronger Palestinian security guarantees.
	   Although the two sides are now at loggerheads, Arafat said,
``peace is a very noble target and we have to work very hard to
achieve it.''

American tenor rescues Bayreuth `Meistersinger' _ again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAYREUTH, Germany (AP) _ For the second year in a row, American
tenor Robert Dean Smith saved a performance of Wagner's
``Meistersinger of Nuremberg'' by replacing his German colleague
Peter Seiffert in the last act.
	   Festival director Wolfgang Wagner, the composer's grandson, had
explained before the opera began that Seiffert was suffering from a
cold _ as he was last year _ and asked for the audience's
understanding if he was unable to deliver a peak performance.
	   Wagner came out again before the beginning of the two-hour final
act to announce that Smith would be taking over the role.
	   The same thing happened last year, although Seiffert made it
halfway through the final act then before bowing out.
	   Smith, who is on the program to sing the role later in the
month-long festival, received thunderous applause after Sunday
night's sold-out show.

Dragons beat Giants 6-1

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Leo Gomez drove in four runs with two homers and
rookie Kenshin Kawakami pitched a five-hitter with 10 strikeouts as
the Central League's second-place Chunichi Dragons beat the Yomiuri
Giants 6-1 at Nagoya Monday.
	   Gomez hit one homer in the second inning and another, a
three-run shot, in the four-run seventh. Gomez, formerly with the
Chicago Cubs, now has 15 home runs.
	   Kawakami (9-3) struck out the Giants' first six batters, and
yielded his only run in the top of the ninth, when league leader
Hideki Matsui of the Giants hit his 21st homer of the season.
	   The Dragons are still five games behind the front-running
Yokohama BayStars, who were idle Monday, along with the Hanshin
Tigers.
	   At Tokyo's Jingu Stadium, the Yakult Swallows extended their
winning streak to four with a 4-0 victory over the Hiroshima Toyo
Carp, aided by a two-run home run by Atsunori Inaba. Inaba has
three homers.
	   The Carp suffered their six straight defeat.
	   In the Pacific League, Toshihiro Noguchi hit a home run in the
two-run fifth and tripled home the winning run in the ninth as the
front-running Nippon Ham Fighters edged the Seibu Lions 3-2 at
Seibu Dome.
	   Noguchi has nine homers this season.
	   The Fighters are 9 1/2 games ahead of the Kintetsu Buffaloes,
who moved into second place by extending their winning streak to
three with a 4-3 victory over the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks at Osaka
Dome.
	   Yuji Yoshioka of the Buffaloes hit the winning home run in the
bottom of the ninth, his ninth homer of the season.
	   The Hawks suffered their third straight defeat.
	   At Kobe, Kiyoshi Hatsushiba ignited a four-run fourth inning
with a double, leading the Chiba Lotte Marines to a 9-0 victory
over the Orix BlueWave.

Police officer, soldier among four killed in Karachi
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with three more deaths. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ A Pakistani police officer and a
paramilitary soldier were among four people gunned down Monday in
Karachi, a day after two soldiers were killed in the troubled
Pakistan port city.
	   The soldier was killed by gunmen who escaped after firing on a
paramilitary patrol. The police officer, who was in civilian
clothes, was shot as he rode a motorbike in another Karachi
neighborhood.
	   Police did not identify the two other victims, shot Monday in a
separate incident.
	   On Sunday, two off-duty soldiers disappeared from a market and
were later found in a Karachi cemetery with their hands tied behind
their backs and bullet wounds in their heads.
	   Police portrayed the soldiers' killings as reprisals for a
crackdown over the last 10 days in which paramilitary troops have
arrested more than 500 people in Karachi's Liaqatabad neighborhood.
Police did not say which of Liaqatabad's two main factions was
believed responsible.
	   The paramilitary troops are trying to quell fighting between the
Mohajir Quami Movement and a breakaway faction that has left more
than 250 dead in the last six weeks. The MQM, which is a member of
Pakistan's governing coalition, represents Muslims who moved to
officially Islamic Pakistan from predominately Hindu India when the
two independent countries were carved out of one British colony in
1947.
	   Militants among Mohajirs, as Muslims from India are known, claim
they are discriminated against and years ago turned to violence to
press their demands to be treated the same as Pakistan-born
Muslims. Various Mohajir factions soon began fighting each other
for power, plunging Karachi into near-anarchy.

Russia begins military exercises near Chechnya
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS plea from Russian politicians in grafs 11-12. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia began military exercises in the Caucasus
region on Monday in an effort to ease increasing violence in its
restive southern republics of Chechnya and Dagestan, a news agency
reported.
	   The exercises follow President Boris Yeltsin's recent overtures
of support for Chechnya's government and his decision to have Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko resume negotiations with the president of
the secessionist republic.
	   The military maneuvers, which run until Friday, are designed to
tighten coordination between various forces to fight terrorist
attacks, free hostages, and combat smuggling _ exactly the sort of
incidents on the rise in Russia's fringe republics.
	   ``Measures aiming to maintain law and public order in the region
should be comprehensive and carried out according to a single
plan,'' said Russian Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin, according
to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Stepashin said the exercises ``do not mean that somebody is
preparing for some massive combat action.''
	   Chechnya and Dagestan have been plagued by a rise in
kidnappings, killings, and theft. Maskhadov, who declared a state
of emergency in Chechnya last month, narrowly escaped a car bomb on
Thursday that killed two of his bodyguards.
	   Forces taking part in the exercises include the Interior
Ministry, the Border Guard Service, the Federal Security Service,
and troops stationed around Stavropol, 1,200 kilometers (750 miles)
south of Moscow.
	   Yeltsin ordered Kiriyenko to meet this week with Maskhadov to
demonstrate support for his government, even though the Chechen
president led a 1994-96 war for independence from Russia that ended
in political deadlock.
	   ``The simple fact of this meeting is very important,'' Ivan
Rybkin, Russia's top negotiator with the Chechens, told the
Interfax news agency.
	   ``After a long break, negotiations between Moscow and Grozny
will occur at a high level. In that period, many bitter problems
have accumulated that can be destroyed only by the leaders of
Russia and Chechnya.''
	   Four top Russian politicians demanded on Monday that Russia
clarify its stance on Chechnya in light of increased violence in
the region, including the hostage-taking of Russia's presidential
envoy to Chechnya, Valentin Vlasov, almost three months ago.
	   Former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, former national
security chief Alexander Lebed, Tatarstan region President Mintimer
Shaimiyev and Boris Berezovsky, executive secretary of the
Commonwealth of Independent States, demanded in a statement that
the Russian government ``immediately formulate a position on the
Chechen republic and the North Caucuses ... and consistently
implement it,'' news agencies said.
	   Though Maskhadov said he favored new negotiations, he blamed
Russia for Chechnya's present situation.
	   Maskhadov also ruled out any compromise on the republic's
independence, repeating that Chechnya would never sign a document
``which might limit Chechnya's independence even by one percent,''
he told the Interfax news agency.
	   Six people have been arrested so far in connection with the car
bomb attack on Maskhadov, but by Monday afternoon three were
released, the Interfax news agency said.
	   One of the people being held is an elderly man whose apartment
was used by gunmen during the attack, Interfax said.

Maradona in talks with Spanish second division club, news reports

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ ``Could you imagine Maradona joining
Badajoz?''
	   That's what the headline of Spanish sports daily Marca stated
Monday, reporting that Argentine soccer idol Diego Maradona could
join Badajoz _ a humble Spanish second division side _ as
player-coach next season.
	   Marca said Maradona's manager Guillermo Coppola had started
negotiations with Badajoz, whose owner is Argentine comic Mauricio
Tinelli, but no agreement had been reached.
	   Since he retired from football last year, the four-time World
Cup player has considered a number of ways to get back into the
game.
	   Earlier this year, he reportedly explored the possibility of
joining an Argentine second division team. During the recent France
'98 World Cup, reports circulated that he was negotiating with an
English team.

Solidarity wants appeal of court decision to sell Gdansk shipyard
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A spokesman for the ruling Solidarity-led
bloc in parliament said Monday that the board of the bankrupt
Gdansk shipyard should continue trying to find ways to satisfy
creditors and avoid its sale to a competitor.
	   Spokesman Piotr Zak said Solidarity backed the board's decision
to appeal a court ruling that said the Gdansk shipyard should be
sold to a consortium including another Polish shipyard, Gdynia.
	   But Zak announced no new initiatives to help bail out the
shipyard where the Solidarity democratic movement was born during
the communist era.
	   The Solidarity-led government has drawn criticism from within
its own ranks for not doing enough to bail out Gdansk; six of
Solidarity's parliamentary deputies defected from the ruling
coalition in protest Friday.
	   A bankruptcy judge said Thursday that the Gdansk board has
failed to prove it could pay off the bulk of the shipyard's dlrs
182 million debts, and said Gdynia's offer was ``the most
profitable and credible.''
	   The Gdansk board said it would file an appeal of the decision by
next Thursday.
	   The Gdynia consortium reportedly would pay dlrs 29 million for
Gdansk, and has pledged to spend dlrs 80-100 million through 2010
to modernize the shipyard and boost the work force from the current
2,000 to as many as 4,500.
	   Zak said that the Gdynia offer was not bad. But he said that if
the Gdansk board managed to turn the shipyard around it would
``create better conditions for its further development.''
	   Though Solidarity has been unable to win support from its
coalition partners for a government bailout of the shipyard, many
of the group's members are trying to help the ailing yard.
	   Solidarity's parliamentary leader Marian Krzaklewski is head of
a foundation that has raised dlrs 1.5 million so far for the
shipyard. A foundation started by the Catholic radio network Radio
Maryja also is aimed at helping Gdansk.

Chinese mull blowing dikes to save cities

	   WUHAN, China (AP) _ With waters in the rain-swollen Yangtze
River dangerously high and still rising, China is considering
blowing up dikes and diverting flood waters into farm districts to
save cities from flooding, official media said Monday.
	   As the third flood crest this month roared toward hard-pressed
central China, authorities warned that levees weakened by weeks of
rain and high water could collapse under the sustained pressure,
the China Daily said.
	   The situation in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze is
entering ``the most critical stage,'' the newspaper quoted regional
flood relief official Li Antian saying.
	   To release pressure on the dikes, authorities may have to blast
open upstream levees, inundating crop land and forcing tens of
thousands of farmers to evacuate, the newspaper said.
	   It didn't say when or where levees might be blown, but such
tactics underscore authorities' desperation in dealing with the
highest Yangtze water levels in 44 years. Some of China's most
populous farm areas and important industrial centers are now at
risk, including Wuhan city, with more than 7 million residents.
	   Farther downstream, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces declared states
of emergency late Monday as the Yangtze's waters climbed to
historical high levels. Jiangsu has already begun evacuating people
living on islands in the Yangtze in anticipation of the flood
crest.
	   Flooding so far has killed more than 1,145 people since rains
began falling heavier than usual in the spring. Almost a million
people have been forced from their homes in the three worst-hit
provinces _ Hunan, Hubei and Jiangxi.
	   The State Council, China's Cabinet, issued a directive Monday
ordering flood relief agencies to coordinate operations and ``spare
no effort'' to help those affected.
	   Disaster relief material, including 400 rubber rafts, 800,000
sandbags and 240,000 square meters (2.6 million square feet) of
sheeting, has been sent to Hunan already, the Xinhua News Agency
reported.
	   Rains have pushed 3,600 kilometers (2,100 miles) of mud and
stone dikes to the breaking point in the Yangtze basin, the
newspaper said. Inspectors have found 1,000 weak points along
levees in Hubei, and sandbags have been stacked over a meter (yard)
high along a 240-kilometer (140-mile) section.
	   Dikes have already been breached in several places along the
Dongting lakes in Hunan, which connect to the Yangtze. Downstream
on Saicheng Lake near Jiujiang, Jiangxi province, 100 meters
(yards) of dikes have crumbled and more may go despite repair work
by thousands of citizens and paramilitary troops, Xinhua said.
	   The river at Jiujiang is expected to reach the top of levees in
two or three days.
	   Flooding has been blamed for 22 deaths around Jiujiang. Another
person was killed and a dozen were injured by a tornado that roared
through farm country south of the city on Sunday, Xinhua said.

Blair puts personal stamp on Cabinet in reshuffle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair put his personal stamp
on his government in his first Cabinet reshuffle Monday, appointing
a powerful ``enforcer'' to coordinate policy and promoting former
campaign manager Peter Mandelson.
	   When Blair came to power in May 1997, he was required under
Labor Party rules to put in his Cabinet those who had been elected
to ``shadow'' Conservative Party ministers then in power. The
reshuffle marked the prime minister's first opportunity to choose
his own people.
	   Blair sacked four Cabinet members but kept the key players _
treasury secretary Gordon Brown, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, Home
Secretary Jack Straw and Defense Secretary George Robertson.
	   Mandelson, 44, a key strategist and close confidante of the
prime minister, reportedly had been lobbying for a seat in the
Cabinet, and he was rewarded with the job of trade and industry
secretary, replacing Margaret Beckett. He has been minister without
portfolio, with a range of duties including the Millennium Dome
project and public presentation of government policies.
	   Beckett was given another Cabinet-level job as leader of the
House of Commons.
	   Another big winner in the reshuffle was Agriculture Secretary
Jack Cunningham, 58, who becomes minister for the Cabinet office, a
new job cutting across ministries to ensure that Blair's line is
being followed. The media has already dubbed him the ``enforcer.''
	   Chief Secretary to the Treasury Alistair Darling, 44, takes over
as social security secretary and another rising star, education
minister Stephen Byers, 45, replaces him. The chief secretary, the
second slot in the treasury, is a member of the Cabinet along with
the treasury secretary.
	   Nick Brown, 48, a close Blair ally who has been chief whip,
moves into the Cabinet as agriculture secretary.
	   The four Cabinet members who lost their jobs were Social
Security Secretary Harriet Harman, Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster David Clark, Lord Richard who was leader of the House of
Lords, and Transport Minister Gavin Strang. Welfare reform minster
Frank Field, one of Harman's deputies, announced his resignation
from the government.
	   Blair has followed the centrist policies of ``New Labor,''
wooing big business, avoiding upsetting millions of middle-class
voters who deserted the Tories last year and sticking to promises
not to raise personal income taxes. Labor leftists and trade union
leaders have been restive, angered that the prime minister has kept
in place most of the drastic curbs on union power introduced by the
Tories.

President supports Polish province consolidation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ President Aleksander Kwasniewski signed
into law Monday a bill to consolidate Poland's 49 provinces into 16
new ones, ending months of bickering over a broad administrative
reform.
	   The reform, which takes effect Jan. 1, aims at doing away with
the communist-era administration and shifting power to local
governments.
	   Signing the bill into law, Kwasniewski said he hoped it will
help ``decentralize the state, strengthen local governments and
citizens' powers,'' the presidential press office said in a
statement.
	   Although the government-proposed reform seemed to have broad
political support, the number of provinces turned out to be a
sticking point.
	   The government originally sought to consolidate provinces into
12 big regions, but under pressure from cities that would lose
their status as provincial capitals, it agreed to increase the
number to 15. That plan was vetoed by Kwasniewski, forcing the
government to seek compromise with the opposition.

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ A land mine blew up an armored personnel
carrier in Georgia's breakaway province of Abkhazia on Monday,
injuring several Russian peacekeepers in the third such bombing in
two weeks, officials said.
	   Abkhazian Deputy Interior Minister Konstantin Adleiba said two
peacekeepers were killed and three injured in the blast in the
Ghali region, but the peacekeepers' command said only that three
servicemen were injured, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   No one has claimed responsibility for the bombing and, as in the
attacks earlier this month, Abkhazian separatists blamed Georgian
pro-government militia groups.
	   ``Georgia wants to destabilize the situation in the Ghali region
by any means,'' the Abkhazian government said in a statement.
	   Members of a leading Georgian militia group, the White Legion,
denied responsibility for the explosion. The group does not mine
roads in the region where the blast occurred, said White Legion
commander Zurab Samushia, according to Interfax.
	   Bondo Dzhikiya, Georgia's presidential representative to the
regions bordering the separatist province, blamed Abkhazian
separatists and peacekeepers for failing to ensure order in the
volatile region.
	   ``The zone is controlled by Abkhazians and peacekeepers,''
Dzhikiya said. ``It is they who should care about safety in the
zone.''
	   Georgian officials have repeatedly accused Russian peacekeepers
of being too soft on separatists.
	   ``I am not going to accuse everyone now _ as Abkhazians do _ for
planting the mine,'' Dzhikiya said. ``Let them investigate first.
But in my opinion such provocations are staged to aggravate the
situation on the eve of the U.N. Security Council session on
Abkhazia.''
	   Last week, nine Russian peacekeepers were wounded when their
truck was blown up by a radio-activated mine in Abkhazia. On July
11, five Russian troops were killed in a similar incident.
	   The peacekeepers were sent to stabilize the Black Sea province
of Abkhazia in 1994 following a war in which Abkhazian separatists
drove out Georgian government troops. Large-scale fighting has
ended, but sporadic clashes have continued, despite the
peacekeepers' presence.

Opposition economics expert takes on Sunday shopping ban
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with criticism of Schroeder's tactics; additional
background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The millionaire businessman picked to be
economics minister if the Social Democrats unseat Chancellor Helmut
Kohl faced renewed fire Monday from his party's traditional allies
_ the unions _ this time over his proposal to do away with
regulations on store hours.
	   Jost Stollmann, a computer entrepreneur without party
affiliation, called Germany's shopping laws a ``fossil'' and said
shoppers and store employees alike eventually would demand longer
evening and weekend shopping hours.
	   Labor unions and church groups have been most vocal in defending
Germany's shopping limits, which force stores to close at 8 p.m.
weekdays, 4 p.m. on Saturdays and altogether on Sundays. Church
groups say there should be no commerce on the Sunday sabbath, and
union groups say store clerks already are overworked.
	   Roldan Issen, head of the DAG white-collar union, said Monday
that Stollmann should stick to the Social Democrats' campaign
position backing the current store hours.
	   Most shop clerks are women and expanding weekend shopping hours
would make it more difficult for women to balance roles as mothers
and bread-winners, Issen said.
	   Ahead of Sept. 27 national elections, Stollmann already has
angered labor groups with tough, free-market proposals including
cutting subsidies to old industries such as coal.
	   He has questioned the usefulness of a government-sponsored
``alliance for jobs'' with business and labor, which the Social
Democrats have proposed to fight unemployment.
	   And he has called for cutting taxes and trimming the social
welfare system, such as imposing income limits for families to
qualify for benefits paid per child.
	   Despite drawing criticism from both friends and foes of the
left-leaning Social Democrats, the party's chancellor candidate
Gerhard Schroeder has stood behind his choice of Stollmann, saying
Germany needs independent thinkers.
	   If you try to be ``everybody's darling'' you risk becoming
``everybody's fool,'' Schroeder said Monday.
	   But analysts say Schroeder's support of Stollmann may simply be
part of his effort to attract middle-of-the-road voters by casting
himself as business-friendly.
	   The president of the German Industry Association, Hans-Olaf
Henkel, said in Monday's Die Welt newspaper that Stollmann's
proposed welfare reforms ``are nothing more than a tactical game.''
	   Although Henkel called the proposals sensible, he believes
Stollmann has no chances of implementing them against the
resistance of unions and party traditionalists.

ASEAN says economic monitoring system not abandoned
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The start of a pioneering scheme for
Southeast Asian countries to mutually monitor each of their
economies has been delayed, but the early-warning system to avert
future crises in the region isn't being abandoned, an official said
Monday.
	   Nine months after finance ministers of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations endorsed a mutual surveillance system to
exchange and review economic data, the scheme is still just a
blueprint.
	   There is little prospect of getting the plan off the ground
until ASEAN governments can agree on the sensitive issue of what
type of data will be shared.
	   ASEAN Secretary-General Rodolfo Severino acknowledged that
implementing the surveillance system was taking longer than
expected but said the group is still committed to it.
	   At a meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers over the weekend,
Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said some ASEAN members
found the data being requested were too ``intrusive'' and
``private.''
	   Siazon did not name the ASEAN members balking at the prospect of
sharing data among the group, although Malaysia is reportedly among
them.
	   ASEAN comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
	   Under the plan, the Manila-based Asian Development Bank is to
oversee the operations of the surveillance system for two years
before it moves to ASEAN's secretariat in Kuala Lumpur.
	   The exact role of the ADB's involvement also has not been worked
out.
	   ``We're pushing (for the surveillance mechanism). It's not dead
_ it's alive but delayed,'' Severino said.
	   Severino stressed that while it was important to quickly
implement the surveillance system, it wasn't a quick-fix for the
region's year-old financial crisis.
	   ASEAN foreign ministers closed their 31st annual meeting
Saturday. Their joint communique gave political backing to the
measures adopted by ASEAN's finance ministers to deal with the
region's financial crisis, but no new solutions were offered.

China warns of threat to security from Asian financial crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Thai minister's comments &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Comparing East Asia's financial
crisis with the devastations of war, China and Thailand warned
Monday that new problems could emerge to threaten regional
stability.
	   Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, addressing a security
forum arranged by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations,
stressed that economic growth is the ``material basis'' for
regional _ and global _ security.
	   East Asia's financial crisis, he told the ASEAN Regional Forum,
``fully indicates that economic security has increasingly become an
inseparable part of national and regional security.''
	   The crisis ``broke out ferociously ... no less than that of a
war,'' he said.
	   Thailand Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan used similar
terminology in speaking of ``the debris of the economic crisis ...
human suffering, the tens of millions of our people who, by one
bang of the crisis, are now sliding back into poverty and
deprivation.''
	   ``The entire region could be engulfed in turmoil of another
entirely new security dimension,'' said Surin. ``I believe what we
are facing now is nothing less than a total war, total
insecurity.''
	   Because so much attention is focused on surviving economically,
with reduced resources, ``we tend to neglect drugs, environment,
international crimes, trafficking of women and children, extremism
in our midst, displaced persons,'' said Surin.
	   He mentioned ``100,000 displaced persons fleeing the fighting in
Myanmar into Thailand as well as some 800,000 economic migrants.''
The best way for them to return, he said, ``is to have conditions
of stability in Myanmar.'' Thailand also hopes that ``the 55,000
Cambodian displaced persons along the Thai-Cambodian border will
now be able to return'' home following recent elections meant to
lead to a peaceful political settlement.
	   For China, Tang said that economic security meant safeguarding
the economic sovereignty of the state.
	   Tang, however, called for countries in the region to promote
deeper economic cooperation and, in particular, to take ``strict
precautions'' against excessive currency speculation.
	   It was the devaluation of the Thai baht in July 1997 that
unleashed speculative attacks against several currencies in the
region and started East Asia's now year-old financial crisis.
	   ``Economic security is mutual, and it is inadvisable to try to
shift one's troubles onto others,'' Tang said.
	   Tang's address made no mention of the yuan or the country's
oft-stated commitment not to devalue the Chinese currency.
	   Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, however, said he
believes the economic crisis so far has had little effect on
regional security.
	   On the positive side, he said, many countries have had to reduce
their defense expenditures because of the currency crisis. But that
has been offset by the fact that they also have had to reduce joint
military exercises, which are an important confidence-building
element, he said.
	   In the short term, he said, the greatest risk of the economic
crisis to security is in illegal movements of people seeking jobs.

Cambodian king `positive' about elections, Solarz says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk says he is
generally satisfied with the way Cambodia's national election was
conducted, a top U.S. election observer said Monday.
	   Stephen Solarz, a former U.S. congressman who is a co-leader of
the main U.S. election monitoring group, met the king for two hours
Monday at his palace in the northwestern town of Siem Reap.
	   ``I think he was fairly positive about the election,'' Solarz
said. ``He felt there were some problems with it, but on balance
seemed to feel that it looked pretty good.''
	   The king has kept a low profile on the election, not commenting
publicly on it since mid-June, when he issued a statement urging
all Cambodians to vote and assuring them of ballot secrecy.
	   Solarz told The Associated Press that he had met Sihanouk and
also toured several district office where votes were being counted,
and that election workers and observers gave the process good
marks.
	   Solarz, who headed the House International Affairs subcommittee
on Asian and Pacific affairs when he was in Congress, said they
spoke about the election's implications for the future of Cambodia
``and the extent to which it provided the Cambodian people with an
opportunity to genuinely and legitimately determine their own
destiny.''
	   Solarz said he believed the king, whose son, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, is one of the opposition candidates, wanted the
international community ``to support the cause of peace, stability
and democracy in Cambodia.''
	   Solarz is working in Cambodia for a coalition of the National
Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute,
the international democracy promotion wings of the Democratic and
Republican parties in the United States.
	   Sihanouk stayed neutral in the election process. The coup staged
by strongman Hun Sen last year to depose Ranariddh as co-prime
minister exposed the king's political weakness as a figurehead
monarch.
	   Hun Sen has repeatedly voiced opinions that the royal family
should stay out of politics.

	   TARKOUMIYA, West Bank (AP) _ An Israeli air force A-4 Skyhawk
jet fighter crashed Monday during a training exercise in the West
Bank, the army said.
	   A pilot and student pilot ejected from the U.S.-made plane
before the crash and were slightly injured, the army said. The army
said the crash was caused by unspecified ``technical problems'' and
was being investigated.
	   The plane crashed into a wheat field in the village of
Tarkoumiya, 10 kilometers west of Hebron, and broke into hundreds
of pieces. Army officers searched the surrounding fields and olive
orchards while crowds of Palestinians looked on.
	   Ziad Abu Haltam said he saw the two pilots parachute from the
sky and heard the plane explode, then approached the downed pilots
and helped clean blood from their faces and legs.
	   ``I said don't be scared, I'm here to help you,'' he said.
	   The village is in the 70 percent of the West Bank still under
full Israeli control.
	   The Skyhawks were made by McDonnell Douglas Corp. before it
merged with The Boeing Co. last year. Israel Radio said the army
uses the fighters to train pilots.

U.N. delegates dig in during fact-finding mission

	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ A U.N. delegation on Monday visited
Algiers' Serkadji prison, site of a deadly mutiny two years ago, as
part of its fact-finding mission to this country wracked by
violence for more than six years.
	   The six-member delegation headed by former Portuguese President
Mario Soares has maintained a discrete profile since its arrival
Wednesday on a two-week visit.
	   Military-backed authorities relented to international pressure,
allowing a U.N. mission but with assurances that its job is not to
conduct a full-fledged investigation on the violence that has left
an estimated 70,000 people dead or on human rights abuses.
	   Authorities blame the violence, including numerous massacres, on
Muslim insurgents. But there have been questions as to whether the
military might not have played at least a passive role in some
massacres.
	   Prison visits by outsiders are all but unheard of, meaning the
mission was breaking new ground with its visit to Serkadji, where
nearly 100 people were reported killed in a 1995 mutiny by
prisoners.
	   It was not immediately known whether the delegation met only
with prison officials.
	   After initial meetings with government officials,
representatives of opposition parties and privately-owned newspaper
editors, the delegation appeared to be digging into its task.
	   Over the weekend, delegates met with Armed Forces Chief Gen.
Mohamed Lamari, asking him about how the army was fighting the
insurgency, according to an informed source speaking on condition
of anonymity.
	   ``We're trying to get a complete vision of something that is
immensely complex and immensely difficult in all aspects,'' Soares
told Portuguese radio TSF.
	   Rumors circulated that the mission had met Sunday with leaders
of the banned Islamic Salvation Front.
	   A source close to the Salvation Front claimed Monday that the
U.N. delegation met with the two top leaders of the outlawed party
-- one of whom has been jailed since 1991.
	   The information could not be immediately confirmed. The
spokesman for the Salvation Front's executive body in exile,
Abdelkrim Ould Adda, said officials representing the party in
Europe were not able to confirm such a meeting took place.

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The successful rescue of a miner given up
for dead after a massive landslide buried him and 10 others in a
talc mine was a virtual miracle, mining experts and doctors said
Monday.
	   They spoke a day after Georg Hainzl, 24, was hoisted by cables
from the 60-meter (200-foot)-deep eating area where he was trapped
by masses of mud following heavy rains July 17.
	   A second, larger mudslide buried 10 others who had been sent to
rescue him after the accident in the town of Lassing, 190
kilometers (120 miles) southwest of Vienna.
	   After Hainzl was rescued alive and in surprisingly good health,
rescuers on Monday redoubled their efforts to reach the other ten,
believed trapped 130 meters (430 feet) in the talc mine. Talc is a
soft mineral which is refined into talcum powder and lubricants.
	   During the weekend, officials had said there was no chance that
Hainzl or the others could still be alive so long after the
accident. Someone had ordered eleven coffins already last week, but
the order was later canceled when the local mayor found out about
it.
	   After officials decreed on Sunday that no one else's health
would be put at risk and the rescue operation was winding down,
rescuers decided to continue their efforts to reach an eating area
where Hainzl was trapped before the shaft was to be sealed with
cement.
	   The rescue of Hainzl, whose girlfriend is three months pregnant,
raised new hopes for his missing colleagues.
	   ``He arrive in a very good state (of health),'' said Werner
List, a chief anesthesiologist in a hospital in Graz, where Hainzl
was taken in a decompression chamber.
	   Doctors later said that Hainzl complained about back pain and
showed signs of dehydration. He was also in a state of fear.
	   Hainzl spent almost 10 days without food and water in complete
darkness. He did not dare to drink muddy water, fearing for his
health, doctors said.
	   Dr. Maria Smolle-Juttner said the physically fit miner survived
his ordeal because, ``overall, a humid atmosphere prevailed and his
body hardly released liquid.''
	   ``He repeatedly heard drilling noise,'' hoping to be rescued,
she said. ``But in the end he did not believe any more in his
rescue,'' sitting on a table in darkness.
	   Experts were also stunned how easily Hainzl seemed to have coped
with the difference between heightened pressure under ground and
air pressure outside the mine when he was lifted the the surface.
But one doctor said the difference was much smaller than expected
because under normal circumstances the pressure contrast would have
been fatal.
	   After several hours of sleep, Hainzl was surprisingly alert and
hungry, asking for a local breakfast dish which doctors overruled
as too greasy.
	   ``He has now eaten and drunk, talked with his father over
earphones,'' Smolle-Juttner said, adding her patient will remain
several days under intensive care for medical observation.
	   ``He feels good and wanted to go home this afternoon, but then
realized it would be better to stay for some time,'' Smolle-Juttner
told reporters.
	   Hainzl asked to be taken from a single-bed room to a four-bed
room because he is frightened. Psychologists said he will need
therapy for months.
	   Chancellor Viktor Klima and other government officials rushed to
the scene early Monday to thank rescuers for their effort and to
urge them to keep digging for other possible survivors. But chances
to retrieve them alive were said to be virtually nil.
	   Austrian media also quoted Klima as criticizing experts who gave
up too soon. ``(Hainzl's) rescue is a victory of hope over the
technocrats who go all too quickly by the calculus of probability
and don't do all humanly possible so that human lives are saved.''

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian officials postponed the
release Monday of preliminary results from parliamentary elections,
raising fears that the overnight delay could allow tampering with
the figures in favor of strongman Hun Sen.
	   More than 90 minutes after the results from Sunday's vote were
due to be announced, election officials told a meeting room packed
with party activists, journalists and human rights workers that
incomplete documents and communications problems had forced a delay
until Tuesday morning.
	   ``These results are not clear enough to be released,'' said
Samraing Kimsain, spokesman of the National Election Committee,
which is dominated by Hun Sen supporters. ``We want to wait for
more clear information and hope to release the results tomorrow,
step by step.''
	   A big victory by Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party could bring
a more stable government to Cambodia. But if the result is not
accepted by the opposition or the millions who waited in line
Sunday to cast their ballots, the outcome could be more turmoil for
a nation that has suffered 30 years of civil war and the Khmer
Rouge genocide of the late 1970s.
	   The three major parties each claimed sweeping victories
throughout the day as members reported results from various
locations, but the violence-marred election campaign and Hun Sen's
steps to pack key agencies with his backers had long raised
expectations that come the election, the final figures would show
victory for the CPP.
	   ``I think I have to wait for the results, but the delay makes me
nervous,'' said Lu Laysreng, a candidate for the opposition
FUNCINPEC party headed by Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who was deposed
as co-prime minister by Hun Sen's troops in pitched street battles
a year ago.
	   The other main opposition leader, former Finance Minister Sam
Rainsy, had said earlier that the Cambodian People's Party was the
clear loser in the election, according to results that his workers
had obtained as ballots were slowly counted throughout the day.
	   Few independent election observers predicted that any of the
three major parties would win an outright majority of the 122 seats
at stake in the National Assembly, but Sam Rainsy told the news
media after the delay was announced that that appeared to be the
ruling party's aim.
	   ``The CPP say they're going to get 65 or 66, and they're
arranging the results with the NEC to have it match,'' a shaken Sam
Rainsy said. ``We are moving into a very dangerous game. They want
to buy time, they want to arrange the result of the election.''
	   Earlier, an Interior Ministry official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, had told The Associated Press that the CPP would win
more than 60 seats. Included in the tally were seats that
opposition parties thought they had sewn up in regions where the
CPP is known to be weak.
	   Though not enough for the two-thirds majority to have a
government confirmed, the CPP would be in a position to dictate
terms for forming any kind of coalition arrangement and keep
control over the key ministries, finances and the armed forces.
	   When the United Nations sponsored Cambodian elections in 1993
backed by 20,000 peacekeepers, Ranariddh's party finished atop the
vote. The CPP, which had ruled a single-party state under the harsh
Vietnamese military occupation that followed the Khmer Rouge
regime, was surprised to finish second.
	   Hun Sen refused to accept the result and threatened civil war,
forcing his way into a co-premiership. The tense arrangement
shattered last year when he sent tanks into the streets to depose
Ranariddh.
	   The new elections were called in a bid to restore international
legitimacy and aid, but the opposition was denied access to the
media, party workers were killed, beaten and threatened, and voters
were intimidated.

Politicians races to congratulate England's winning cricketers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British politicians were racing to be the first to
congratulate the England cricket team after it's eight-wicket
victory over South Africa in the fourth test at Trent Bridge on
Monday.
	   Culture, Media and Sports secretary Chris Smith interrupted
question time in the House of Commons to be the first to
congratulate the English cricketers.
	   His congratulations, just minutes after England clinched the
vital test and levelled the five-match series 1-1 with one test to
play, was cheered from all sides of the political spectrum.
	   England has not won a test series at home against a major
cricket power since David Gower's team beat Australia in 1985.
	   The team had been outplayed by South Africa in the previous two
tests, losing by 10 wickets in the second test and just scraping
home for a draw in the third test, but reversed its fortunes Monday
and now has a real chance of scoring an historic series win.

West, Kanu late for pre-season training

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Nwankwo Kanu and Taribo West, members of
Nigeria's World Cup team, have not reported to Inter Milan's
pre-season training camp and could face fines, a spokesman for the
Serie A club said Monday.
	   West, a defender, was due to report last Wednesday, while Kanu
was given more time off but was expected to have been in contact
with the club. The team has not heard from either.
	   Kanu, who led Nigeria to the 1996 Olympic gold medal, is
supposed have his injured knee examined by a team doctor Tuesday.
The lanky striker saw limited playing time at the World Cup, where
Nigeria reached the second round.
	   Meanwhile, three of Italy's national team members will report to
camp Tuesday. They are Roberto Baggio, acquired from Bologna to
pair in attack with Brazilian superstar Ronaldo, 'keeper Gianluca
Pagliuca and veteran sweeper Giuseppe Bergomi.
	   Another international, winger Francesco Moriero, is reportedly
close to a deal that would ship him to English club Middlesbrough.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Firefighters struggled Monday to control a
forest fire scorching the slopes of Mount Olympus, the legendary
home of the ancient gods.
	   Meanwhile, dozens of other fires burned through brush and
woodlands around Greece in the most devastating season of blazes in
decades. In Loutraki, about 85 kilometers (50 miles) west of
Athens, homes were abandoned as fires moved toward populated areas.
	   Hundreds of hectares (thousands of acres) of forest have been
burned since the fires broke out late last week on the 2,900-meter
(9,570-foot) Mount Olympus, about 400 kilometers (250 miles)
northwest of Athens.
	   Two fire-fighting planes assisted crews on the ground on
Olympus.
	   In Kalamata, about 280 kilometers (168 miles) southwest of
Athens, two children's camps were evacuated after fires burned the
surrounding forest.
	   Though wildfires are common during hot and dry summers in
Greece, this season has been called the most devastating in
decades. Four firefighters died last week battling a fire on the
outskirts of Athens.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces cleared Albanian rebels
Monday from a key highway linking Kosovo's two largest cities,
opening a strategic route which had been blocked by separatist
guerrillas since May.
	   Serb police traveling westward from this provincial capital and
eastward from the province's second-largest city, Pec, linked up on
the highway. They showed reporters weapons, ammunition and other
materiel captured from the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The Serb forces joined in the village of Kijevo, some 50
kilometers (30 miles) west of Pristina.
	   Fighting continued Monday on the highway between Pristina and
Prizren to the south. It was one of three main roads which Serb
police hoped to clear when they launched their offensive late
Friday.
	   There were no reports about fighting along the third route,
which runs along the Albanian border. KLA rebels, seeking
independence for the Serb province, move back and forth to
sanctuaries in northern Albania.
	   The Serb operation was aimed at splitting the estimated
one-third of the province under KLA control. Albanian analysts
suggested that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was trying to
deliver a blow to the rebels before agreeing to talks with moderate
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova on the future of the province.
	   The KLA has refused to endorse Rugova's leadership because he
opposes violence.
	   On Monday, Rugova's party, the Democratic League of Kosovo, said
the latest offensive ``has deepened the crisis of war in Kosovo and
will prevent a solution through dialogue.''
	   Albanians compromise 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people.
The KLA opposes Rugova because he has renounced violence. Rugova's
party has appealed to the United States, the European Union and
other organizations to stop the government offensive, which began
late Friday.
	   Milosevic has offered to restore Kosovo's autonomy, which he
abolished in 1989, but he opposes independence. Kosovo is a
province of Serbia, which is part of Yugoslavia.
	   Rugova's top aide, Fehmi Agani, told The Associated Press that
the offensive appears aimed at gaining a clear advantage on the
battlefield before peace talks, which the Americans and Europeans
are trying to broker.
	   ``Milosevic is trying in every way and at all costs to secure a
superior position before possible negotiations,'' Agani said. ``It
has always been his position to negotiate from a superior
position.''
	   The Americans and Europeans also oppose independence, fearing it
will lead to greater demands by the ethnic Albanians to unite with
Albanian communities in other Balkan countries and destabilize the
entire region.
	   Seven Albanians were killed early Monday trying to cross
illegally from Yugoslavia into neighboring Albania, the Serb Media
Center reported. The incident occurred near the KLA stronghold of
Junik, 35 kilometers (20 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   In Tirana, the Albanian foreign ministry protested to the
Yugoslavs that cross-border fighting incidents that occurred over
the weekend were ``provocations that violated the national
integrity of Albania.'' On Sunday, both Yugoslav and Albanian
officials reporting an exchange of fire across the mountainous
frontier.

Report: Malaysia remains good investment destination
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Despite a massive slowdown, the
business environment in Malaysia has become attractive for foreign
investors, a Hong Kong-based research company said in a report
released Monday.
	   ``Significantly lower staff turnover has led to higher
productivity and important savings in training budgets,'' said the
Political and Economic Risk Consultancy.
	   ``Companies producing exports denominated in U.S. dollars are
enjoying higher margins as a result of the depreciation of the
ringgit,'' it added.
	   But the consulting firm warned that Malaysia would not allow
foreigners to buy domestic companies at fire-sale prices and
tensions within the governing United Malays National Organization
raised concerns about political stability.
	   The report pointed to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad pressing
ahead with policies that his deputy, Finance Minister Anwar
Ibrahim, opposed.
	   These included a softer monetary policy, easier credit, lower
interest rates and risking the economy further by government-funded
bailouts of debt-ridden companies, the report said.
	   The report came hours after the respected international rating
agency, Standard and Poor's, announced it was lowering Malaysia's
long-term bond ratings. Another reputable rating company, Moody's,
did the same Friday.
	   The flurry of gloomy forecasts come at a time when Malaysia has
launched an ambitious recovery program to pump funds into ailing
banks. The theory is that the banks will lend more and increase
spending on infrastructure and construction works to generate jobs
and downstream projects.
	   The government said Monday it was deferring a plan to raise dlrs
2 billion in government bonds.
	   ``The government will only bring a transaction to the market
once market conditions are conducive for an issue,'' a Finance
Ministry statement said.
	   After the Moody's report, a fund-raising roadshow by Anwar and
senior Cabinet Minister Daim Zainuddin to Europe and North America
was postponed.
	   Anwar this month forecast a recession for 1998, with the economy
shrinking by up to 2 percent. But independent analysts say it could
contract by 5 percent as the nation's worst economic crisis
deepens.
	   The national news agency Bernama quoted Anwar as saying
postponement of the trip will not jeopardize the Asset Management
Company, a body set up recently to help debt-ridden companies and
banks burdened by bad loans.
	   He said the government had adequate funds to manage the body's
operations in the first stage, Bernama added.

Switzerland angers Turkey by allowing Kurdish meeting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey on Monday accused Switzerland of
``insensitivity'' for allowing a Kurdish conference to be held in
Lausanne while refusing Ankara the use of a palace there to mark
the 75th anniversary of a treaty that defined Turkey's boundaries.
	   Authorities in Lausanne had denied Turkey the use of the Palais
de Rumine, where Turkey on July 24, 1923 signed the Treaty of
Lausanne.
	   The Foreign Ministry said a Kurdish conference was held a day
after Turkey hoped to celebrate the treaty, and Kurdish
demonstrators held a march chanting anti-Turkish slogans.
	   Kurdish rebels have been waging a war for autonomy in Turkey's
southeast since 1984. Some 37,000 people have died in the conflict.
	   ``We condemn Switzerland for displaying such an insensitive
stance ... that has dismayed Turkish public opinion'' a ministry
statement said.
	   The treaty was negotiated after Turkey, rejecting the 1919
Treaty of Sevres that carved up the Ottoman Empire and established
a Kurdish state, fought to win back its Aegean coast and southeast
regions.
	   The mayor of Lausanne refused to lend the palace, saying he
would rather commemorate the Treaty of Sevres than the Lausanne
treaty, according to unconfirmed Turkish newspaper reports.
	   The Swiss government said it did not have a say because the
palace belonged to local authorities.

Nigeria halts oil contracts to review procedures
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's military ruler has stopped
awarding oil concessions and prospecting leases to domestic and
foreign firms in an effort to clean up the procedures, a Lagos
newspaper reported Monday.
	   Nigeria's oil industry has been rife with corruption for years.
	   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, has also ordered the Department of
Petroleum Resources, the regulatory agency for the oil industry, to
provide an up-to-date listing of awards already granted, the daily
Lagos Guardian said.
	   For years, top junta officials were widely believed to have
profited from Nigeria's multi-billion dollar oil industry, which is
the linchpin of the economy.
	   Abubakar came to power in early June, after the death of
dictator Gen. Sani Abacha.
	   Abacha's five-year dictatorship left Nigeria scarred and
isolated. Corruption, neglect and incompetence that flourished
during his rule crippled Nigeria's economy and infrastructure,
while an abysmal human rights record made it a diplomatic pariah.
	   Abubakar has pledged to change all that, promising the release
of political prisoners, prosecutions of corrupt officials and a
return to civilian government by May 29, 1999.

Central Bank says knotty foreign exchange system Pakistan's only
</HEADLINE>
hope &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ A two-tier system meant to help
Pakistan husband its foreign exchange reserves is the only hope for
the economic future, the head of the country's central bank said
Monday.
	   Banks and business people have balked at the system for buying
and selling foreign currency. The rules were announced soon after
Pakistan was hit with international economic sanctions for testing
nuclear weapons in May. Since then, the country has seen its
foreign reserves cut by more than half, said Mohammad Yaqub,
governor of the State Bank of Pakistan.
	   ``This system has to work, otherwise there is no hope,'' he told
reporters, adding he planned talks with banks, importers and
exporters over the next two days to find a way to make the new
rules ``equitable and workable.''
	   The government's foreign reserves have dropped from dlrs 1.2
billion before the test to dlrs 531 million as of last Friday,
Yaqub said. At that rate, in less than two months this country with
140 million people and a foreign debt of dlrs 30 billion will have
no money to pay for imports or service debts.
	   The United States, Japan and other countries cut off loans and
aid to both Pakistan and its neighbor and rival India after the two
conducted tit-for-tat nuclear tests in May. India's much larger and
more isolated economy has generally withstood the sanctions, while
Pakistan's already weak economy was brought to the brink of
collapse.
	   The foreign currency rules mean importers and exporters who once
brought and sold currency at market rates from local banks are
restricted to doing half their deals at an official government rate
of 46 rupees to the U.S. dollar. The banks, meanwhile, have been
told to keep their rates within half a rupee of the official rate.
	   The rupee is trading on the open market in Pakistan at about 56
to the dollar.
	   Exporters responded to the exchange rules by sitting on their
foreign currency rather than depositing it in state banks in
exchange for rupees. Banks have refused to issue letters of credit
to importers, saying they are confused by the new rules.
	   The government took other steps to shore up its foreign
reserves, including stopping imports of all but essential
commodities _ edible oil, petroleum, medicine, wheat and beans. In
addition, fuel prices were raised and Pakistanis who had money in
special U.S. dollar or other foreign currency accounts were told
they could withdraw their money only in rupees or use it to buy
government bonds.

U.N. tries to keep Angolan peace process alive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Alarmed by signs that Angola's fragile
peace process is unraveling, the United Nations on Monday appealed
to the government and former rebels to halt their apparent slide
back into civil war.
	   Sixteen people, including five soldiers, were killed in ambushes
and landmine incidents in the northeastern Lunda Norte province
over the weekend, Angolan state radio RNA reported.
	   The government has accused the former rebel movement UNITA of
masterminding the attacks, which were the latest in a series of
reported incidents in the area. There was no independent
verification of the reports.
	   ``The situation remains unstable. There's continuing tension in
11 of the country's 18 provinces,'' U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst
said.
	   ``We're urging the two sides to show restraint and not move any
closer to conflict than they already are,'' he said after meeting
with government and UNITA officials.
	   The two sides signed a peace pact in 1994 to end their
two-decade civil war, but lingering hostility between them has
delayed the agreement's full implementation.
	   President Jose Eduardo dos Santos said earlier this month that
the country was in a state of ``undeclared war.''
	   Some 215 people were massacred, including 88 who were burned
alive in their huts, in the same area early last week, according to
unconfirmed reports.
	   The diamond-rich Lunda Norte province has been a flashpoint in
the past. One year ago, government and UNITA forces clashed there
in incidents which threatened to pitch the country back into war.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ runs diamond-mining operations in
Lunda Norte. The diamonds provide the movement with hundreds of
millions of dollars annually, analysts say.
	   UNITA refuses to hand over its central highland strongholds to
the government, alleging that police have committed human rights
abuses in areas already handed over.

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ A land mine blew up an armored personnel
carrier in Georgia's breakaway province of Abkhazia on Monday,
injuring three Russian peacekeepers in the third such incident in
two weeks, officials said.
	   The victims were hospitalized, and one of them was in grave
condition, the Russian Defense Ministry said. Abkhazian officials
said earlier that two peacekeepers had died, but the Russian
statement denied that.
	   No one has claimed responsibility for the bombing and, as in the
attacks earlier this month, Abkhazian separatists blamed Georgian
pro-government militia groups.
	   ``Georgia wants to destabilize the situation in the Ghali region
by any means,'' the Abkhazian government said in a statement.
	   Members of a leading Georgian militia group, the White Legion,
denied responsibility for the explosion. The group does not mine
roads in the region where the blast occurred, said White Legion
commander Zurab Samushia, according to Interfax.
	   Bondo Dzhikiya, Georgia's presidential representative to the
regions bordering the separatist province, blamed Abkhazian
separatists and peacekeepers for failing to ensure order in the
volatile region.
	   ``The zone is controlled by Abkhazians and peacekeepers,''
Dzhikiya said. ``It is they who should care about safety in the
zone.''
	   Georgian officials have repeatedly accused Russian peacekeepers
of being too soft on separatists.
	   ``I am not going to accuse everyone now _ as Abkhazians do _ for
planting the mine,'' Dzhikiya said. ``Let them investigate first.
But in my opinion such provocations are staged to aggravate the
situation on the eve of the U.N. Security Council session on
Abkhazia.''
	   Last week, nine Russian peacekeepers were wounded when their
truck was blown up by a radio-activated mine in Abkhazia. On July
11, five Russian troops were killed in a similar incident.
	   The peacekeepers were sent to stabilize the Black Sea province
of Abkhazia in 1994 following a war in which Abkhazian separatists
drove out Georgian government troops. Large-scale fighting has
ended, but sporadic clashes have continued, despite the
peacekeepers' presence.

Nokia to make dlrs 185 million investment in Hungary, Finland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Taking advantage of surging profits and
sales, Finnish telecommunications group Nokia said Monday it will
invest nearly 1 billion markkaa (dlrs 185 million) to increase
mobile phone production.
	   The investment will be for a new manufacturing plant and
distribution center in Hungary, and for increasing cellular phone
production at Nokia's plant in Salo, south Finland.
	   Nokia, which last week reported a record half-year profit of
5.55 billion markkaa (dlrs 1.02), said it expects some 600 million
cellular phone subscribers worldwide by the end of 2001 _ up from
200 million at the end of 1997.
	   ``Coupled with the subscriber increase, the mobile phone sales
volumes are growing due to the rise of the replacement market,''
said Matti Alahuhta, president of Nokia's mobile phones division.
	   In addition to the Salo plant, Nokia has mobile phone
manufacturing units in Germany, the United States, Mexico, Brazil,
China and South Korea.
	   Last year, Nokia sold 21 million cellular hand sets, making it
the world's second largest mobile phone maker after Motorola Inc.,
based in Schaumburg, Illinois.
	   During January to June this year, Nokia increased net sales of
mobile phones by 41 percent over the same period 1997, to 18.95
billion markkaa (dlrs 3.5 billion).
	   Nokia is a world leader in digital mobile phone technology, and
has supplied GSM equipment to 67 operators in 35 countries. Its
total sales encompass 130 countries, with main markets in the
United States, Britain, Germany and China. It employs 41,000 people
worldwide.
	   Nokia's total pretax profit last year more than doubled to a
record 8.37 billion markkaa (dlrs 1.55 billion).

Court rules Basson must appear before South African truth body
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A court ruled Monday that the
mastermind behind an apartheid chemical and biological warfare
program must testify before a panel probing human rights abuses.
	   At hearings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in June,
scientists told how they plotted to disable President Nelson
Mandela and tried to develop a bacteria that would only kill black
people.
	   The news shocked a nation used to the catalogue of horrors that
has emerged from commission hearings.
	   Dr. Wouter Basson, who set up the program through a network of
army front companies, has sought to put off testifying, arguing
that an appearence may prejudice his upcoming criminal trial on
charges ranging from drug possession to conspiracy to murder. The
trial is tentatively set to begin next month.
	   However, in a court case brought by the commission, Judge John
Hlophe ruled that Basson must appear before the panel on Wednesday.
	   Basson has not said whether he would comply with the order. If
he refuses, he could face contempt charges.
	   With the Truth Commission wrapping up its operations at the end
of the week, the case was the last chance to force Basson to
appear.
	   A list of questions for Basson was handed over to Hlophe. They
included queries on his role in making poisoned food and drinks and
links with government hit squads.
	   Set up in 1995, a year after all-race elections ended apartheid,
the Truth Commission is charged with uncovering crimes committed by
all sides in the struggle against white rule and with promoting
racial healing.

Archaeologists find that pyramid builders received medical care
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TAREK EL-TABLAWY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The workmen who built the pyramids received
emergency medical care and even brain surgery, the head of an
Egyptian archaeological team said Monday.
	   Zahi Hawas, the director of antiquities for Giza, said his
team's excavation of 20 workers' tombs near the pyramids has thrown
light on the lives of ordinary Egyptians of the Old Kingdom, which
dates back to 4,500 years ago.
	   ``This discovery provides clear evidence of worker lives - a
chance to understand how these people lived, what they ate,'' Hawas
said.
	   Archaeologists found six skeletons. X-rays revealed what may be
the earliest evidence of brain surgery. The worker was operated on
for a brain tumor, said Hawas.
	   The leg of another worker had been amputated and he had lived
for 14 years after the operation. Tests on a third skeleton showed
what could be the earliest proof of syphilis and the hand of a
fourth skeleton was found in splints, Hawas said.
	   The ancient Egyptians were long believed to have been capable of
performing complex medical procedures, including brain surgery and
complicated births.
	   Hawas said that about 600 skeletons from two cemeteries for the
pyramid builders have been exhumed and tested. A total of 12
skeletons had splints on their hands, which had presumably been
injured by rocks.
	   ``These were not slaves who built the pyramids. They were
workers. This much care would not have been afforded to slaves,''
he said.
	   The workers were allowed to build small pyramids, made of
mud-bricks, above their own tombs, Hawas said.
	   ``The (mud brick) pyramids are like democracy. They were
available for everyone,'' he said.
	   Some tombs bore inscriptions that gave the worker's position,
such as ``Inspector of Pyramid Building'' and ``Overseer of West
Side of Pyramid.''

Greek line signs deal to boost Superfast fleet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece's passenger shipping group Attica
Enterprises has signed a dlrs 450 million contract with a German
firm for more high-speed ferries for the highly competitive
Greece-Italy route, Attica said Monday.
	   The four vessels will be delivered in 2000 and 2001 and Attica
has an option for two more ships from Howaldtswerke Deutsche Werft
AG.
	   The deal was described by Attica as ``the largest investment in
the history of Greek passenger shipping.''
	   Each vessel will have capacity to carry 1,500 passengers and
1,000 vehicles. The four new ships will raise the company's
Superfast fleet working the Greece-Italy sea route to eight
ferries.

	   RUHENGERI, Rwanda (AP) _ An estimated 15,000 Hutus have begun
emerging from forests in northwestern Rwanda where they were forced
to flee by rebels more than a year ago, civilian and army officials
said Monday.
	   Emmanuel Uwihanhanye, the mayor of Nyamutera commune near the
northwestern town of Ruhengeri, said several of those who came out
said they had seized the opportunity when they saw the Hutu rebels
in disarray after government soldiers killed two rebel leaders last
week.
	   The two leaders were among 40 rebels killed when the army
thwarted an attack in northern Byumba Prefecture, Radio Rwanda said
Monday.
	   The radio said two rebels were wounded and captured on Saturday
when a group of about 100 fighters tried to attack Cyungo in
Byumba, about 70 kilometers (40 miles) north of the capital,
Kigali. Other rebels apparently escaped.
	   Government and army officials said the loss of rebel leaders,
who were believed responsible for organizing attacks in which
thousands of civilians have died, meant the rebel operations were
seriously hampered.
	   The rebels rely on Hutus living in the area to provide them with
shelter, food and money.
	   Hutus make up 65 percent of the population in Rwanda and are
heavily concentrated in the northwestern part of the country.
	   Hutu rebels have been launching attacks from the northwestern
forests bordering Congo and Uganda since 1996, when they mixed with
more than 1 million Hutu refugees returning from exile.
	   The rebels are former Hutu soldiers and militiamen responsible
for the 1994 Hutu government-organized slaughter of more than
500,000 minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus.
	   The killing ended when Tutsi-led rebels ousted the Hutu
government in July 1994.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The successful rescue of a miner given up
for dead after a massive landslide buried him in a talc mine was a
virtual miracle, mining experts and doctors said Monday. But there
was no word on 10 others buried after being sent to his rescue.
	   They spoke a day after Georg Hainzl, 24, was hoisted by cables
from the 60-meter (200-foot)-deep eating area where he was trapped
by masses of mud following heavy rains July 17.
	   A second, larger mudslide buried 10 rescuers who had been sent
to search for the miner buried in the town of Lassing, 190
kilometers (120 miles) southwest of Vienna.
	   After Hainzl was rescued alive and in surprisingly good health,
rescuers on Monday redoubled their efforts to reach the other ten,
believed trapped 130 meters (430 feet) in the talc mine. Talc is a
soft mineral which is refined into talcum powder and lubricants.
	   During the weekend, officials had said there was no chance that
Hainzl or the others could still be alive so long after the
accident. Someone had ordered eleven coffins already last week, but
the order was later canceled when the local mayor found out about
it.
	   After officials decreed on Sunday that no one else's health
would be put at risk and the rescue operation was winding down,
rescuers decided to continue their efforts to reach an eating area
where Hainzl was trapped before the shaft was to be sealed with
cement.
	   The rescue of Hainzl, whose girlfriend is three months pregnant,
raised new hopes for his missing colleagues.
	   ``He arrive in a very good state (of health),'' said Werner
List, a chief anesthesiologist in a hospital in Graz, where Hainzl
was taken in a decompression chamber.
	   Doctors later said that Hainzl was complained about back pain
and showed signs of dehydration. He was also in a state of fear.
	   Hainzl spent almost 10 days without food and water in complete
darkness. He did not dare to drink muddy water, fearing for his
health, doctors said.
	   Dr. Maria Smolle-Juttner said the physically fit miner survived
his ordeal because, ``overall, a humid atmosphere prevailed and his
body hardly released liquid.''
	   ``He repeatedly heard drilling noise,'' hoping to be rescued,
she said. ``But in the end he did not believe any more in his
rescue,'' sitting on a table in darkness.
	   After several hours of sleep, Hainzl was surprisingly alert and
hungry, asking for a local breakfast dish which doctors overruled
as too greasy.
	   Austrian media also quoted Chancellor Viktor Klima as
criticizing experts who gave up too soon. ``(Hainzl's) rescue is a
victory of hope over the technocrats who go all too quickly by the
calculus of probability and don't do all humanly possible so that
human lives are saved.''

Malaysian 15-year-old jailed for drugs; mother acquitted
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A 15-year-old boy, believed to be
the youngest ever charged in a Malaysian court for drug offenses,
was sentenced Monday to five years in prison and 10 strokes of a
cane, a news report said.
	   Judge Mohamad K. Abdul Rahman ruled that the Dangerous Drugs Act
overrode the Juvenile Act, and the boy should be sentenced under
the drug act. He was given the maximum possible sentence for
possession.
	   The court was told that police narcotics officers had detained
the boy's 39-year-old mother as she was seen attempting to throw
away a plastic bag suspected to contain drugs last Oct. 4, the
Bernama news agency reported.
	   Police investigation showed that the drugs _ 1.8 grams (.06
ounces) of heroin and 4.8 grams (.17 ounces) of morphine _ belonged
to the boy, it added.
	   The mother was acquitted of possession charges after prosecutors
offered no further evidence against her, Bernama said.
	   Defense counsel M. Sathiaseelan said the boy was young and did
not know the consequences of his act.

 &UR; Pantani takes lead as Tour de France hits Alps; Ullrich fades &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with day's stage
 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LES DEUX ALPES, France (AP) - Marco Pantani of Italy took over
the lead in the Tour de France Monday by moving away in the final
two climbs and opening a gap over defending champion Jan Ullrich.
	   Pantani was in fourth place entering the day, 3 minutes, 1
second behind Ullrich. After the finish. At the end of the day he
had a lead of 3 minutes, 53 seconds over American Bobby Julich.
	   Ullrich, weakening in the final climb, ended up almost nine
minutes behind on the day and dropped down to fourth overall, 5:56
behind.
	   The 15th stage from Grenoble to Les Deux Alpes, 189 kilometers
(117.5 miles) with four major climbs including two rated ``out of
category'' on a scale of steepness, height and length.
	   The hills were made worse with rain and fog throughout the day.
Temperatures dipped below 10 C (50 F) after Sunday's stage was more
than 30 C (86 F).
	   It was mostly a waiting game throughout the day until the final
two climbs. Although France's Christophe Rinero and others built a
lead coming over the first two peaks, the group of favorites were
watching each other.
	   Then Pantani went into action.
	   Then, heading up the 2,645-meter (8,650-foot) Galibier mountain,
Pantani made his move.
	   He quickly left the other favorites and took off after the
Rinero group.
	   He built up a lead of almost three minutes at the top of the
mountain and even had time to stop completely and put on a plastic
jacket to protect him from the wind and cold on the descent.
	   Although Ullrich cut the gap slightly on the downhill, Pantani
moved away on the final climb to the ski station of Les Deux Alpes,
almost 1,650 meters (5,400 feet) with rain worsening.
	   Ullrich kept having trouble. He had a flat. He stopped to confer
with his team car. Two teammates arrived to help.
	   Nothing worked for Ullrich, losing more than three minutes to
Julich on the day.
	   There are two more days in the Alps with an important time trial
coming up on Saturday. In the last one, Ullrich gained more than
four minutes in the first long time trial of the Tour.
	   Tuesday's stage has five more climbs but all are between 950
meters (3,106 feet) and 2,000 meters (6,540 feet) with better
weather predicted.

Candidates censured for election violations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Four candidates in Hong Kong's May elections,
including one who won a seat in the legislature for a pro-Beijing
party, were censured Monday for violating election rules.
	   The Electoral Affairs Commission censured a three-member ticket
of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong led by
Chan Yuen-han, who won election in the Kowloon East district in the
May 24 vote.
	   It also found that independent candidate Jennifer Chow, who ran
on Hong Kong island, had violated election rules.
	   Chan's ticket campaigned in a housing estate without permission,
and on election day put up an election banner in the estate, even
though no campaigning was permitted there, the commission said in a
statement.
	   Chow was found to have put up election advertisements in spots
reserved for other candidates.
	   Justice Woo Kwok-hing, head of the election commission, said the
censures should serve as a warning to candidates in the future.
	   Despite widespread complaints that the rules limited democracy,
the elections were widely regarded as being well-run by the
election commission.

Italian premier in Turkey to discuss EU issues

 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with QUOTES from news conference &QL; 
 &UR; With AP PHOTOS &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ The European Union has not slammed its
door on Turkey and efforts must be maintained to help Turkey into
the union, Italian Premier Romano Prodi said on a one-day visit to
Istanbul.
	   Prodi held talks with Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on
Turkey's difficult relations with the EU, Greece and Cyprus.
	   Ankara put its relations with the 15-member union on hold in
December when the EU excluded it from the initial round of
enlargement talks.
	   ``I have suggested a few concrete suggestions to help Ankara
come closer to Brussels,'' Prodi said before going on a two-hour
cruise on the Bosporus strait that separates Istanbul's European
and Asian shores.
	   Although Yilmaz thanked Italy for its help in pushing the
Turkish candidacy, he rejected Prodi's proposal to attend the next
EU conference scheduled later this year in Austria.
	   ``It is out of the question that we attend the Austrian
conference,'' Yilmaz said, adding that Turkey's position may change
if there was progress on the European side.
	   Italy, Britain, France, and Spain are reported to have pressed
their EU partners for more favorable treatment of Turkey.
	   ``Italy is not only doing this as an EU country, but also as a
Mediterranean country that shares the responsibility of peace in
the region,'' Prodi said.
	   The Italian premier, who held similar talks with Greek Prime
Minister Costas Simitis last month, said the time was ripe for the
long-standing disputes between NATO allies to be resolved.
	   ``If we don't get results now, with two men like Simitis and
Yilmaz, then I don't know when we will,'' Prodi said. ``The cost of
these tensions are high.''
	   The two leaders also discussed bilateral relations and trade.
	   Italy is Turkey's second largest trade partner. Trade volume
between the two countries is estimated at dlrs 5.7 billion. Yilmaz
said they planned to expand their trade deals in defense and
energy.
	   Several projects of joint cooperation for investments in Central
Asia are reportedly under discussion.

Hundreds more illegal immigrants make it to Italian shores
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FRANCES D'EMILIO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Hundreds more illegal immigrants made it to southern
Italian shores Monday, only to be rounded up into detention
centers. The latest brawl among the unwelcome arrivals left dozens
arrested.
	   In one of the holding centers, in the Sicilian port of
Agrigento, 10 police officers and three would-be immigrants were
injured before police succeeded in breaking up the melee. Police
arrested 37 of the arrivals, who are awaiting processing before
expulsion.
	   Under the European Union's open borders policy, Italy is obliged
to send home the illegal immigrants, many of whom hope to travel
through Italy to northern Europe in search of jobs.
	   A day earlier, another riot broke out, on the tiny Sicilian
island of Lampedusa, among North Africans fighting over a sandwich.
	   At least 158 clandestine immigrants, most of them from North
Africa but a few from Sierra Leone as well, braved the
Mediterranean in simple boats to reach the island. Most of them
slept outdoors on the dock before being taken to a detention center
Monday.
	   The 5,000 inhabitants of Lampedusa, a barren dot in the sea,
exist mainly on tourism, and hotel owners are reporting a rash of
cancellations by alarmed vacationers for August, Italy's biggest
vacation month.
	   ``We're open only a few months a year. In past years we'd be
overbooked for August, even September. We're looking at a black
year,'' said Giuseppina Buscarino, who works at a Lampedusa hotel.
	   Along the coasts of Italy's southeastern region of Puglia, at
least 160 illegal immigrants arrived in the past 24 hours,
authorities said Monday. The arrivals included Albanians, Turkish
Kurds, Iraqis and a few people from Kosovo.
	   Italy has been trying to persuade Morocco and Tunisia to better
patrol their coasts so the illegal immigrants won't slip through on
the nightly runs.
	   Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini was in Morocco Monday to discuss
the tensions over the arrivals, whose count this month alone has
reached about 3,500.
	   Tunisia's cooperation appeared to be lacking. Italian coast
guard officers aboard a cutter in international waters Sunday tried
to convince a Tunisian naval vessel to escort back to Tunisia a
boat with illegal arrivals. But the plan failed and the boat,
dangerously overcrowded, eventually was allowed to drop off its
passengers on Lampedusa.
	   Earlier this year, hundreds of Turkish Kurds poured in by boat
to Italy, prompting Germany to accuse Rome of laxity.

 &UR; German nun found slain in South Africa &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with autopsy results, quotes from school spokesman,
locator on hometown;

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Police on Monday were searching for
the killers of a German nun, whose body was found in a rural area
north of this coastal city five days after she disappeared.
	   Sister Theodelind Schreck, 57, principal of a school in Eshowe,
was found face down in the woods near a road Sunday. An autopsy
showed that she died of a gunshot wound, said Lindy Lawrie, a
spokeswoman for the Holy Childhood Convent School.
	   Police said they believe the motive was robbery.
	   Eshowe lies in KwaZulu-Natal province, which has a long history
of political violence. But the slaying of a nun in what appeared to
be a common crime was unusual in the area, and shocked many.
	   ``I think it's just evil people,'' Lawrie said. ``They needed a
car, and sister's car was the first one they spotted.''
	   The school's 220 pupils, aged 6-13, ``are very, very upset and
traumatized,'' she said. ``But people also are very angry that such
a terrible thing could happen to such a dedicated person.''
	   Local leaders denounced the violence.
	   ``Sister Theodelind Schreck was dedicated to her teaching and
religious duties,'' said Ben Ngubane, premier of KwaZulu-Natal
province. ``Violence remains violence, irrespective of
motivation,'' Ngubane said.
	   The Roman Catholic nun disappeared on Wednesday after dropping
off her nephew at a nearby mission. She was on her way back to
Eshowe, near the Indian Ocean coast and about 130 kilometers (80
miles) north of Durban.
	   Her car had been found in a poor area outside the city. In it
were the nun's identification document; a tire and the radio had
been stolen, said
	   Schreck was born in the village of Gissigheim, Germany, near
Tauberbischofsheim, and came to the school in 1970.

Millions of yen found shredded in Japanese river
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Police said Monday they were searching for the
owner of 2 million yen (dlrs 14,000) in cash that had been shredded
and thrown into a river in a Tokyo suburb.
	   Residents first reported finding bits of 1,000 yen (dlrs 7) and
10,000 yen (dlrs 70) notes on Saturday afternoon, said a police
spokesman in the town of Hayama, 48 kilometers (30 miles) south of
Tokyo.
	   By Sunday, residents had come across more than a thousand pieces
along the banks of the Morito River, said the spokesman, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
	   Whoever shredded the notes had apparently used scissors to
painstakingly cut them into randomly sized pieces, the spokesman
said.
	   He said the actions were probably those of someone who was
emotionally unstable. He said there were no signs of foul play and
no laws had been broken.
	   No one has come forward to claim the bills, most of which could
still be exchanged for new money at a bank, he said.

U.N. tries to keep Angolan peace process alive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Alarmed by signs that Angola's fragile
peace process is unraveling, the United Nations appealed Monday to
the government and former rebels to halt their apparent slide back
into civil war.
	   Sixteen people, including five soldiers, were killed over the
weekend in ambushes and land mine explosions in the northeastern
Lunda Norte province, Angolan state radio RNA reported.
	   The government has accused the former rebel movement UNITA of
masterminding the attacks, which were the latest in a series of
reported incidents in the area. There was no independent
verification of the reports.
	   ``The situation remains unstable. There's continuing tension in
11 of the country's 18 provinces,'' U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst
said.
	   ``We're urging the two sides to show restraint and not move any
closer to conflict than they already are,'' he said after meeting
with government and UNITA officials.
	   The two sides signed a peace pact in 1994 to end their
two-decade civil war, but lingering hostility between them has
delayed the agreement's full implementation.
	   President Jose Eduardo dos Santos said earlier this month that
the country was in a state of ``undeclared war.''
	   There are unconfirmed reports that 215 people were massacred,
including 88 who were burned alive in their huts, in the same area
last week.
	   The diamond-rich Lunda Norte province has been a flashpoint in
the past. One year ago, government and UNITA forces clashed there
in incidents which threatened to pitch the country back into war.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ runs diamond-mining operations in
Lunda Norte. The diamonds provide the movement with hundreds of
millions of dollars annually, analysts say.
	   UNITA refuses to hand over its central highland strongholds to
the government, alleging that police have committed human rights
abuses in areas already handed over.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian officials postponed the
release Monday of preliminary results from parliamentary elections,
raising fears that the overnight delay could allow tampering with
the figures in favor of strongman Hun Sen.
	   More than 90 minutes after the results from Sunday's vote were
due to be announced, election officials told a meeting room packed
with party activists, journalists and human rights workers that
incomplete documents and communications problems had forced a delay
until Tuesday morning.
	   ``These results are not clear enough to be released,'' said
Samraing Kimsain, spokesman of the National Election Committee,
which is dominated by Hun Sen supporters. ``We want to wait for
more clear information and hope to release the results tomorrow,
step by step.''
	   A big victory by Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party could bring
a more stable government to Cambodia. But if the result is not
accepted by the opposition or the millions who waited in line
Sunday to cast their ballots, the outcome could be more turmoil for
a nation that has suffered 30 years of civil war and the Khmer
Rouge genocide of the late 1970s.
	   Few independent election observers predicted that any of the
three major parties would win an outright majority of the 122 seats
at stake in the National Assembly. But opposition leader Sam Rainsy
told reporters after the delay was announced that that appeared to
be Hun Sen's aim.
	   ``The CPP say they're going to get 65 or 66, and they're
arranging the results with the NEC to have it match,'' a shaken Sam
Rainsy said. ``We are moving into a very dangerous game. They want
to buy time, they want to arrange the result of the election.''
	   The group coordinating the 40 nations that have sent 678
observers to monitor the elections worked long past an initial
deadline to prepare a statement.
	   Last week, the Joint International Observers Group disappointed
the opposition and human rights groups by saying it would be
prepared to endorse a result ``broadly representative of the will
of the Cambodian people'' rather than the tougher ``free and
fair.''
	   In was unclear whether Cambodians would accept a sweeping CPP
victory. At least 90 percent of the 5.4 million registered voters
cast ballots Sunday, showing belief and hope in the democratic
process.
	   The three major parties each claimed sweeping victories Monday
as members reported results from various locations, but the
violence-marred election campaign and Hun Sen's steps to pack key
agencies with his backers had long raised expectations that come
the election, the final figures would give him victory.
	   ``I think I have to wait for the results, but the delay makes me
nervous,'' said Lu Laysreng, a candidate for the opposition
FUNCINPEC party headed by Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who was deposed
as co-prime minister by Hun Sen's troops in pitched street battles
a year ago.
	   Sam Rainsy, a popular former finance minister, had said earlier
that Hun Sen's party was the clear loser in the election, according
to results his activists had obtained as ballots were slowly
counted throughout the day.
	   Earlier, an Interior Ministry official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, had told The Associated Press that the CPP would win
more than 60 seats. Included in the tally were seats that
opposition parties thought they had sewn up in regions where the
CPP is known to be weak.
	   Though not enough for the two-thirds majority to have a
government confirmed, the tally would be enough for Hun Sen to
dictate terms for forming any kind of coalition arrangement and
keep control over the key ministries, finances and the armed
forces.
	   When the United Nations sponsored Cambodian elections in 1993
backed by 20,000 peacekeepers, Ranariddh's party finished atop the
vote.The CPP, which had ruled a single-party state under the harsh
Vietnamese military occupation that followed the Khmer Rouge
regime, was surprised to finish second.
	   Hun Sen refused to accept the result and threatened civil war,
forcing his way into a co-premiership. The tense arrangement
shattered last year when he sent tanks into the streets to depose
Ranariddh.
	   The new elections were called in a bid to restore international
legitimacy and aid, but the opposition was denied access to the
media, party workers were killed, beaten and threatened, and voters
were intimidated.

Captains refuse to comment on umpiring

<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Rival captains Alec Stewart and
Hansie Cronje refused to speculate Monday on the controversial
umpiring which overshadowed England's eight-wicket win in the
fourth cricket test at Trent Bridge.
	   England levelled the five-match series 1-1 with one match to
play, the home side fighting back against a pumped-up South Africa
to win with wickets and overs to spare.
	   The victory gave England hopes of winning its first five test
series since Mike Gatting's team won the Ashes 2-1 in Australia in
1986-87.
	   ``I said for us to win the series, we had to win here and in the
final test, so we are half way there,'' Stewart said Monday after
winning his first test as England captain.
	   The luck had gone distinctly in England's favor at Trent Bridge
but Stewart said his side deserved to win.
	   ``In your eyes you play the game fair. Your accept good
decisions as well as bad ones...that's cricket,'' Stewart said in
reference to several umpiring decisions which could have turned the
outcome of the game.
	   Cronje, the South African captain, was diplomatic about the
result, saying he did not think his team was robbed of a test.
	   ``When you win, the game has gone your way, and when you have
lost, it hasn't _ sometimes I think you make your own luck,'' he
said.
	   Cronje, who scored 126 and 67 in his two innings, said his side
lost because his batsmen did not score enough runs in the third
innings for the bowlers to defend.
	   ``We put ourselves under pressure by getting out cheaply in our
second innings,'' he said after conceding that the team may have
suffered from some complacency after dominated the tests at Lord's
and Old Trafford.
	   ``We were outplayed here. I'm sure the players know now that to
beat England they have to play above average in the last test.''
	   Stewart praised former England captain Mike Atherton for his
unbeaten 98-run contribution to the win in the fourth innings and
rated him as the best opening batsman in the world.
	   ``It was a great innings. He said the test win was important and
not his hundred, and that's how he has always played,'' Stewart
said.
	   South Africa will join world champions Sri Lanka and England in
a limited-overs triangular series at the end of the five-match test
series.

German defense minister says plans still on to apprehend Karadzic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Defense Minister Volker Ruehe says NATO-led
peacekeeping troops are still looking to apprehend Bosnia's two
most wanted war crimes suspects, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic.
	   In an interview to appear in Berliner Morgenpost's Tuesday
edition, Ruehe appeared to contradict a U.S. newspaper report that
the United States and other NATO powers had shelved plans for a
raid to arrest the two men, fearing a blood bath.
	   The daily quoted Ruehe as saying that he assumes that ``all
Bosnian war criminals will either be arrested or turn themselves
this year.''
	   Ruehe said peacekeepers would continue trying to apprehend all
war crimes suspects, including Karadzic, the Bosnian Serbs' wartime
leader, and his military leader, Mladic.
	   The newspaper also quoted unidentified sources in the German
government as saying they knew of no change in NATO policy toward
apprehending Karadzic and Mladic.
	   The New York Times reported Sunday that plans to seize the men
had been two years in the making at an estimated cost of more than
dlrs 100 million.
	   But the newspaper, citing unidentified U.S. officials, said that
U.S. officials have dropped the plans, worrying that such a raid
would inflame the Serbs.
	   French officers in command of the NATO troops who patrol the
part of Bosnia where Karadzic is believed to reside also are
reluctant to act, the newspaper said.

Auditors accuse Odessa authorities of wrongdoings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ City authorities in the Black Sea port of
Odessa misused millions of dollars in municipal funds and illegally
privatized hundreds of buildings, a parliamentary auditing agency
said Monday.
	   Odessa authorities also unlawfully levied dozens of taxes on
local businesses, parliament's accounting chamber said following a
recent inspection.
	   The Odessa government illegally privatized 425 buildings, worth
27.4 million hryvna (dlrs 13.7 million) over the last two years,
and appropriated dlrs 12.4 million of the dlrs 32.9 million raised
from bonds it issued, the agency said, according to the Interfax
news agency.
	   The report by state auditors was another blow to former Odessa
Mayor Eduard Hurvits, who has been feuding with the national
government over control of the city after recent elections.
	   Hurvits defeated President Leonid Kuchma's ally and Odessa
regional administrator Ruslan Bodelan in the March elections, but
the Supreme Court invalidated his victory.
	   Kuchma fired both Hurvits and Bodelan following the Supreme
Court's ruling, and appointed a personal representative to head the
city until new elections are conducted this August.
	   The electoral commission in Odessa turned down Hurvits's
application to run for re-election, but registered Bodelan, who is
now viewed as the most likely winner. The Accounting Chamber's
findings could further hamper the chances of any Hurvits ally to
win.
	   Control over Odessa, one of Ukraine's most active business
centers and the site of a key oil export terminal, is vital for the
central government.

Philippine president defends support for military agreement with
</HEADLINE>
U.S. &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Philippines-Estrada &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada, once a
staunch opponent of U.S. military bases in the Philippines, on
Monday defended his decision to support an agreement that would
allow a resumption of joint military exercises.
	   ``Until we develop a credible military deterrent, we must depend
on the good will of our neighbors, on our treaty commitments with
the United States, and on the skills of our diplomats in conveying
to everyone that we want only peace, stability and shared
prosperity,'' Estrada said in his first state-of-the-nation address
to Congress.
	   Earlier this year, U.S. and Philippine officials signed a
visiting forces agreement that would provide certain legal
protections to U.S. soldiers while in the Philippines.
	   Estrada, a former movie star and senator, helped defeat a treaty
in 1991 that would have extended the lease on the last U.S.
military base, which was forced to close a year later, ending
nearly a century of American military presence in the Philippines.
	   Estrada even made a movie against the base, which has since been
converted into a successful industrial and tourism center.
	   ``It is said that my stand as a senator against the U.S. bases
treaty ... disqualifies me as president from endorsing the visiting
forces agreement with the United States,'' Estrada said in his
speech.
	   ``On the contrary, because I stood up for Philippine sovereignty
in 1991, now as your president, I have the moral right to stand up
for Philippine security today,'' Estrada said.
	   Critics say the agreement, which requires ratification by the
Philippine Senate, could shield American soldiers who commit
offenses from criminal prosecution in Philippine courts because of
various loopholes.
	   The agreement generally gives the United States jurisdiction
over soldiers who commit crimes while on duty, while the
Philippines has jurisdiction over crimes committed while off-duty.
	   Critics say the Philippines is likely to waive its jurisdiction
if requested by the Americans, except in cases ``of particular
importance'' to the Philippines.
	   Under the agreement, American authorities can issue an
``official duty certificate,'' which would show that an offense by
a U.S. soldier was committed while on duty, justifying their
jurisdiction and custody over the offender, the critics say.

Samaranch calls for world conference on drugs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland AP) _ As president Juan Antonio Samaranch
came under fire for reportedly suggesting that some
performance-enhancing drugs should be legal, the IOC said Monday it
will convene a special conference on doping in January.
	   In the wake of Samaranch's controversial remarks in a Spanish
newspaper, the International Olympic Committee said it would
organize a meeting in Lausanne to review the fight against doping
in sport.
	   The statement said Samaranch expects the conference to produce
``a clear definition of doping.''
	   The initiative comes amid the doping scandal which has tarnished
the Tour de France cycling race, with riders and team officials
implicated in widespread use of EPO and other illegal drugs.
	   Samaranch was quoted in the Spanish paper El Mundo on Sunday as
saying the list of banned substances should be ``drastically''
reduced and that drugs which don't damage an athlete's health
should not be prohibited.
	   ``Doping now is everything that, firstly, is harmful to an
athlete's health and, secondly, artificially augments his
performance,'' he was quoted as saying. ``If it's just the second
case, for me that's not doping. If it's the first case, it is.''
	   Steroids and EPO, a synthetic hormone which boosts endurance by
stimulating the production of red blood cells, are known to pose
serious health hazards.
	   The IOC said Monday that Samaranch's statement was ``fully in
line with the ongoing work of the IOC and its medical commission,
aimed at checking and updating the list of prohibited substances.''
	   It said Samaranch referred specifically to codeine, which was
recently removed from the banned list.
	   Reacting to allegations that Samaranch seemed to be taking a
softer line on drugs, the statement said the ``IOC's determination
was greater than ever.''
	   Jacques Rogge, an IOC executive committee member and vice
president of the IOC medical commission, said he was surprised to
hear of Samaranch's reported remarks and wondered whether he had
been misunderstood or misquoted.
	   Rogge, a Belgian surgeon, said it was impossible to
differentiate between drugs which are hazardous or not.
	   ``You have drugs that are bad for the health which don't improve
performance, and should be on the banned list, and you have drugs
that improve performance which are not bad in therapeutic doses,''
he said in a telephone interview.
	   Rogge said athletes tend to over-dose on some drugs.
	   ``EPO is not dangerous in very small doses in therapeutic
conditions for patients, but EPO has probably been the cause of
many (health) problems because athletes take it in too high
doses,'' he said.
	   Primo Nebiolo, president of the International Amateur Athletic
Federation, joined the IOC is calling for a world doping
conference.
	   ``The problem of doping is a problem which affects the whole of
the sports movement and which now needs to be resolved quickly and
effectively after years of indecision and ineffectual decisions,''
he said in a press release. ``We are at a cross roads now and we
cannot afford to take the wrong route. We have to act decisively,
throw off the blinkers and attack the problem at the core...''
	   Nebiolo launched a scathing attack on cycling, noting that the
cycling federation was one of the Olympic sports which refused to
comply with an accord on harmonizing doping rules and sanctions.
	   ``A sport riddled with the suspicion of doping is bad for
everyone and some disciplines are bringing up their athletes with a
credo that doping is part of sport,'' he said.
	   Samaranch's remarks on distinguishing between harmful and
harmless drugs elicited condemnation from officials and athletes in
Germany and Britain.
	   ``I fell under the table when I heard that,'' said Professor
Wildor Hollmann, honorary president of the World Association for
ports Medicine and of the German sport doctors union. ``This way of
thinking is nonsense. That would be an unbelievable step
backwards.''
	   British Olympic Association chief executive Simon Clegg said the
comments attributed to Samaranch were ``harmful'' and went against
the BOA's policy.
	   Steve Ovett, winner of the 800 meters at the 1980 Moscow
Olympics, said the remarks showed Samaranch wanted to ``throw in
the towel'' in the fight against drug cheats.
	   ``I think he is saying that they can't control it, which is a
shame,'' he said. ``How do you define dangerous? Is is when someone
keels over and dies?''
	   Sir Arthur Gold, former head of the BOA and an outspoken
anti-drug campaigner, said, ``These are very unwise remarks by the
IOC president and I disagree totally with them. To use drugs is to
cheat whether they damage your health or not.''

Estrada party controls both houses of Philippine Congress
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada's Struggle
of the Filipino Masses party won the leadership of both houses of
the newly elected Philippine Congress in separate elections Monday.
	   Former Supreme Court Chief Justice Marcelo Fernan, who was the
personal choice of Estrada, was elected president of the 23-member
Senate.
	   Real estate magnate Rep. Manuel Villar was chosen by 171
legislators as speaker of the House of Representatives, defeating
Rep. Feliciano Belmonte of the Lakas party of former President
Fidel Ramos, who received 29 votes.
	   Another contender, Villar party mate Joker Arroyo, received 11
votes.
	   Villar, a former member of Ramos' party, was among the first
legislators to defect to Estrada's party after the former movie

Chinese engineer claims method can straighten Pisa's leaning tower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Chinese engineer who has straightened 80
slanted structures throughout China says his patented techniques
should be able to right Pisa's famed leaning tower, the Xinhua News
Agency reported Monday.
	   Cao Shihzhong left China for Italy Monday to discuss his methods
with authorities trying to keep the 12th-century, 55-meter
(180-foot)-high tower from leaning further, Xinhua said. He was
invited by the Associazione Italia-Cina, an organization that
promotes exchanges between the two countries.
	   Working on the tower has been a lifelong dream, for which Cao
has devoted more than 30 years of experimentation, the agency said.
	   Cao has never failed in work to straighten Chinese pagodas and
other antique structures, it said, without providing details of
Cao's methods.
	   All methods used so far to straighten Pisa's tower have been
wrong, it quoted him saying.
	   The tower was closed to tourists in 1990 for fear it might
topple over. It leans some four meters (13 feet) off the
perpendicular to its south side.

Marathon `McLibel' case stretches into appeal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Call it McLibel, part II.
	   A marathon defamation fight between McDonald's Corp. and two
vegetarian activists spilled back into court on Monday, and the
appeal of the strange case that set an English record for longevity
immediately posed some unusual logistical questions.
	   How can the unemployed defendants collect the tens of thousands
of pages of documents they need to appeal their defeat? And if they
do, will the courtroom be big enough?
	   McDonald's may well have had enough of the so-called ``McLibel''
battle, but it's clear the case still has a good way to run after
duly entering the record books with a 314-day trial that became a
hollow victory for the burger giant.
	   A trial judge ruled in June 1997 that activists Dave Morris and
Helen Steel libeled McDonald's by handing out pamphlets that
sharply attacked its business practices.
	   But the judge slammed McDonald's by agreeing three stinging
criticisms were true. He found McDonald's pays low wages in
Britain, exploits children through advertising and is ``culpably
responsible'' for animal cruelty.
	   Morris and Steel, who are appealing, now say these points were
so damaging to McDonald's that they could not have harmed its
reputation with other statements about the perils of a high-fat
diet and the alleged destruction of rainforests.
	   McDonald's spokesman Mike Love says that from the company's
perspective, its victory stands.
	   The two sides met again in court Monday for the first time since
the judgment was delivered. Morris and Steel said during the
planning hearing that they can't afford to pay 20,000 pounds (dlrs
33,000) to make three sets of the 20,000-page trial transcript, one
for each appellate judge.
	   ``We don't have the finances,'' said Morris, a former postman.
	   The three bewigged judges huddled at the bench and after some
give-and-take with McDonald's lawyers reached a solution that might
even save a few trees.
	   The appeals court will try to get a used copy of the transcript
from the trial judge, a spare copy from McDonald's and then get the
defendants to pay a much lower sum _ around 1,000 pounds (dlrs
1,650) _ for a third copy on computer disk.
	   Another snag. The appellate judges have two copies of the trial
judgment, but they won't be easy to work with because one is
single-spaced and runs 700 pages and the other is double-spaced and
runs 1,400 pages.
	   A lawyer for McDonald's, Timothy Atkinson, voiced a further
logistical concern, asking whether the appeal could be heard
entirely in one courtroom with no need to move the mountains of
paperwork during weeks of arguments set to begin in January.
	   One of the judges, Lord Justice Igor Judge, agreed one courtroom
would be best, but glancing around the one he was sitting in,
wondered aloud whether it was big enough. The judge finally called
for ``the largest court in the building.''

Labor group plans to arrange foreign jobs for Indonesians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A labor organization said Monday it
plans to arrange employment abroad for about 1 million Indonesians
over the next three years to help beat a crippling economic crisis
at home.
	   The Association of Indonesian Laborers said most of the workers
would be sent to the Middle East.
	   Association chairman Abdullah Puteh estimated the scheme would
provide about dlrs 10 billion dollars in sorely needed foreign
exchange for Indonesia.
	   It would also help ease soaring unemployment that has been
triggered by the worst economic crisis to hit Indonesia in 30
years.
	   He said 250,000 workers would be sent abroad in the first year
of the plan. This would increase to 600,000 by the second year and
would reach a total of 1 million by the third year.
	   He did not say when the first workers would leave.
	   Puteh announced the plan after a meeting with President B.J.
Habibie.
	   Labor Minister Fahmi Idris said later the government supported
the scheme and as an incentive would abolish fees currently levied
on all Indonesian workers seeking employment abroad.
	   The Labor Ministry said about 1.1 million Indonesian now are
working in foreign countries, mainly in unskilled occupations.
	   Indonesia has about 90 million workers. The official
unemployment rate is about 15 percent, but many say that figure is
underestimated.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Two top officials of the Dutch team TVM arrived at
a court in the northern town of Reims Monday for an appearance
before a judge likely to place them under investigation in the
widening Tour de France doping scandal.
	   In the latest chapter of the scandal that is overshadowing the
world's top cycling event, TVM sporting director Cees Priem and
team doctor Andrei Mikhailov risk becoming the center of a lengthy
investigation for allegedly organizing the use of EPO within the
team.
	   The director and doctor of the Festina team have been placed in
custody for their roles in the drug use by that team.
	   The TVM officials were taken from Foix in southern France to the
capital of the Champagne region east of Paris, where they arrived
mid-afternoon.

Taiwan condemns Indonesia for abuses targeting ethnic Chinese
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan on Monday warned Indonesia against
condoning a spread of human rights abuses and sexual assault
against ethnic Chinese.
	   ``Ethnic Chinese have been a major power behind Indonesia's
economy,'' Foreign Minister Jason Hu told reporters. ``If this
anti-Chinese sentiment continues, the country will suffer great
harm.''
	   Meanwhile, scores of protesters demonstrated at Indonesia's
representative office in Taipei to condemn Indonesian authorities
for the violence against ethnic Chinese during the rioting there in
May.
	   Ethnic Chinese often are scapegoats in Indonesia in times of
unrest because they control a significant part of the economy.
	   They were targeted in the May rioting, which resulted in the
resignation of President Suharto. Women's groups say gangs
committed at least 168 rapes, and that most of the victims were
ethnic Chinese women and girls.
	   Lawmaker Pan Wei-kang said some of the assaulted women, who
ranged in age from 9 to 60, committed suicide or suffered emotional
breakdowns.
	   She accused Indonesian authorities of hampering the
investigations launched by human rights groups and blocking the
assaulted women from seeking medical treatment abroad.
	   Ahmed Beysofwan, deputy head of the Indonesian mission in
Taipei, said his government has severely punished those who engaged
in violence, but acknowledged that further action has been hampered
by continued unrest.
	   Taiwan and Indonesia do not have diplomatic relations. But
Taiwanese have invested U.S. dlrs 13.2 billion in Indonesia, and
several Taiwanese factories were ransacked in the May rioting.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Reigning British Open and U.S. Masters champion
Mark O'Meara will team up with World No.1 Tiger Woods and John Daly
in the Dunhill Cup at St. Andrews starting Oct. 8, tournament
organizers said Monday.
	   O'Meara has represented the U.S. team in five previous Dunhill
Cups, including 1996 when the U.S. won for the third time, but
Woods will be making his debut appearance in the 13-year-old event.
	   John Daly, who won the 1995 British Open at St. Andrews, has
played in only one Dunhill Cup _ which he won when he teamed up
with Fred Couples and Payne Stewart in 1993.
	   The players selected to represent the other 15 countries
contesting the 1998 Dunhill Cup will be named in September.

Hyundai officials leave to discuss tourism project in North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Eighteen Hyundai group executives left
for North Korea Monday to discuss details of planned tours to the
reclusive communist state by South Korean and foreign tourists.
	   The delegation, led by Kim Woon-kyu, vice president of Hyundai
Construction and Engineering Co., was scheduled to arrive in North
Korea Tuesday by way of Beijing, Hyundai officials said.
	   ``We will discuss tour itineraries, safety matters and all
related working-level issues with our northern counterpart,'' Kim
said.
	   Hyundai's founder and honorary chairman, Chung Ju-yung, visited
his native North Korea for eight days in June with a gift of 500
cattle. He returned with agreements on several joint venture
projects in the North.
	   One of the agreements would allow Hyundai to send 1,000 South
Korean and foreign tourists weekly to Diamond Mountain, a major
tourist site on the North's east coast.
	   Hyundai hopes to send the first group of tourists north on a
cruise liner in September.
	   The fate of Hyundai's tour project, however, has been shadowed
by a recent series of alleged North Korean spy incursions. In June,
a North Korean submarine was found tangled in a fishing net off the
east coast. In mid-July, the body of a suspected North Korean spy
was found washed up on an east coast beach.
	   South Korea demanded an apology from North Korea but Pyongyang
either denied involvement or refused to take responsibility.
	   Despite the incidents, the South Korean government allowed
Hyundai officials to visit the North but hinted that actual tours
could be delayed until North Korea apologizes.
	   ``Our policy is separating politics and the business. Hyundai
officials can go to the North and freely discuss business issues,''
said a spokesman for the Unification Ministry, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   ``But sending thousands of tourists to North Korea is not a pure
business issue in terms of safety and other related matters. To
realize the project, political tension on the peninsula should be
resolved in some way,'' he said.
	   North Korea and South Korea fought a bloody three-year war in
the early 1950s that ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.
South Koreans are required to obtain government approval to visit
North Korea or contact North Koreans.

11 brokerages suspended over deficits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Parliament was told Monday that
the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange has suspended 11 brokerages from
trading because they faced financial losses or problems maintaining
minimum liquidity.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said in a written reply that
the firms were not able to meet the business practices standards
specified by securities industry regulations, the national news
agency Bernama reported.
	   Anwar, who is also finance minister, said the firms also faced
credit and trading risks beyond their capital and financial
capability.
	   ``The problems became more acute following the prolonged market
decline, causing the firms to incur huge losses which were
reflected in the shareholders' fund position,'' he said.

SPLA: donors should investigate inefficiency, corruption in U.N.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Donors should investigate inefficiency and
corruption in a U.N. aid agency leading relief efforts in war-torn,
famine-stricken southern Sudan, a spokesman for rebels fighting the
Sudanese government there said Monday.
	   Pa'gan Amum, spokesman for the Sudan People's Liberation Army,
charged Operation Lifeline Sudan, an umbrella organization for U.N.
and private relief agencies, with hampering relief efforts.
	   ``It is, therefore, no surprise that the response to the
humanitarian crisis and famine in Sudan, especially Bahr el-Ghazal,
is not showing the desired results,'' Amum told a news conference.
	   The southwestern province is the worst hit by the war-induced
famine in Sudan. The United Nations says of the 2.6 million people
in need in all of Sudan _ the largest nation in Africa _ 700,000
are targeted to receive relief food in Bahr el-Ghazal.
	   There are no reliable figures available on the population in the
province.
	   It was not immediately possible to reach OLS officials for
comment.
	   Amum's accusation came as the Rome-based U.N. World Food Program
appealed Monday to donors for an additional 46,500 metric tons of
emergency food for the coming year. In April, WFP appealed for
85,000 metric tons it said were needed through April 1999.
	   The agency also asked for dlrs 154.5 million to cover
operational costs through April.
	   WFP Executive Director Catherine Bertini is scheduled to testify
Wednesday before a congressional committee in Washington on the
Sudan crisis.
	   SPLA's Amum said OLS spends large sums of money on a ``large and
expensive bureaucracy of expatriates'' at its base in the Kenyan
capital, Nairobi, at its Sudan operations base in the northwestern
Kenya town of Lokichokio and in southern Sudan.
	   He said the OLS operation in Lokichokio costs dlrs 3 million a
year to run, a figure confirmed last week by OLS.
	   Amum said OLS employees inflate the cost of food and supplies
purchased in Kenya and Uganda in order to take kickbacks.
	   He denied claims the SPLA has been diverting relief food to
rebels, saying the food is distributed by OLS agents and not the
rebels.
	   ``If that is happening, it is an individual doing it and not the
movement,'' Amum said.
	   Carol Bellamy, head of the U.N. Children's Fund, said in Nairobi
last week after a visit to southern Sudan that she was aware that
all the food was not reaching those targeted but said she did not
believe major looting was taking place.
	   Amum also accused OLS of delivering more food to government-held
areas in southern Sudan than to those held by the rebels.
	   He denied reports that the SPLA collected ``tax'' in the form of
relief food from the civilian population in southern Sudan.
	   At least 1.5 million people have died since the second round of
a civil war broke out in 1983 between the government and the SPLA.
	   The SPLA wants greater autonomy for the predominantly Christian
and animist south, traditionally controlled by the Arab, Islamized
north.

Swiss block Kosovo accounts, investigate suspected arms funding

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Swiss authorities said Monday they had frozen two
bank accounts used to channel funds to ethnic Albanians in Kosovo
amid suspicions that the cash collected is used to buy arms.
	   A number of Swiss-based Yugoslav nationals are being
investigated on suspicion of financing illegal trafficking of arms
to the resistance movement in the province, a statement from the
Swiss federal prosecutor's office said. It didn't specify how many
people are involved.
	   ``Evidence suggesting that the (money collected) is not used, as
claimed, for humanitarian purposes, but rather in a reprehensible
manner, has multiplied during recent days,'' the statement said.
	   At around 8 am Swiss time (0600 GMT), Swiss police made several
arrests after searching three individuals' homes in eastern
Switzerland, Juerg Blaser, spokesman for the prosecutor's office,
said earlier Monday. He didn't identify those arrested.
	   In a telephone conversation with The Associated Press, Mahmuti
Bardhyl, a Swiss-based spokesman for the Popular Movement of
Kosovo, which supports the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army, said
the homes searched belong to three PMK members who are signatories
to one of the frozen accounts.
	   He didn't have any details on the other account.
	   Two of the three members, Agush Buja and Shaban Muja, were taken
to police stations for questioning, Bardhyl said. A third, Mehmet
Bislimi, was away, he said.
	   The PMK account is used to collect cash from the ethnic Albanian
community in Switzerland, which goes to fund humanitarian aid in
Kosovo, Bardhyl said.
	   He later told reporters in Geneva he didn't know whether the
money is also used to buy arms.
	   ``We haven't got the right to say to the people (in Kosovo) who
are facing a massacre that they can buy flour but not arms,'' he
said.
	   Bardhyl said hundreds of thousands of Swiss francs (dlrs) had
passed through the account since it was opened in 1993. He didn't
say exactly how much money it currently holds.
	   The PMK is planning to protest to the Swiss about the moves. The
organization's officials are already talking to lawyers, Bardhyl
said.
	   ``No-one has the right to prevent us helping the (Kosovo)
Albanian population,'' he said.
	   Earlier this month, major powers meeting in the German capital
Bonn urged governments to take urgent steps to prevent funds
collected from ethnic Albanians living abroad from being sent to
finance the KLA.
	   Money from abroad is the guerrilla army's main source of
support.

Factory roof collapses, killing two demolition workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BREMEN, Germany (AP) _ A roof collapsed early Monday as workers
prepared to demolish a factory in the northern city of Bremen. Two
workers were killed and one seriously injured, police said.
	   Police said they were investigating suspicions that the project,
started overnight, was handled by black-market workers hired by a
subcontractor for the demolition company.
	   The two men killed were a 29-year-old Turk who lived in Bremen
and a 25-year-old Turk who lived in nearby Ritterhude. Seriously
injured was a 31-year-old Syrian from Grasberg, another town near
Bremen. Police did not release names of the victims.
	   Police said it was unclear why the concrete section of roof
collapsed at about 4:15 a.m. (0215 GMT). The three victims fell 15
meters (50 feet) onto a concrete floor and were buried in debris.
	   The factory is to be demolished to make way for a shopping
center.

Russian stocks fall 9.1 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian stocks plummeted 9.1 percent Monday, the
sixth straight day of losses as investors expressed doubts about
the government's ability to settle its differences with Communists
in parliament.
	   The stock market got a brief boost earlier this month when the
International Monetary Fund and other lenders agreed on a dlrs 17
billion bailout package to guide Russia through it current
financial crisis.
	   But the Communists in parliament have resisted President Boris
Yeltsin's financial stabilization plan, which includes numerous
tax-raising measures.
	   The standoff has again undermined confidence among both Russian
and foreign investors. The Russian market, which was the world's
top performer for the past two years, is down more than 60 percent
in 1998.
	   Traders said Monday that foreigners were staying out of the
Russian market until it became clear whether the government was
serious about improving the weak tax collection system.
	   Parliament is now on its summer break and the economic policy
differences are not likely to be addressed for at least several
more weeks.
	   Meanwhile, the first installment of the IMF loan has boosted
Russia's hard currency reserves to dlrs 18.5 billion, up from dlrs
13.6 billion a week earlier, Russian news services reported Monday.
	   The IMF loan has helped ease pressure on the Russian currency,
the ruble, which has been trading at around 6.2 to the U.S. dollar.
	   Before the money arrived, the Russian Central Bank had been
spending large sums of hard currency to prevent a devaluation of
the ruble, which would have led to higher prices.

 &UR; Russia begins military exercises near Chechnya &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: ADDS plea from Russian politicians in grafs 11-12. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia began military exercises in the Caucasus
region on Monday in an effort to ease increasing violence in its
restive southern republics of Chechnya and Dagestan, a news agency
reported.
	   The exercises follow President Boris Yeltsin's recent overtures
of support for Chechnya's government and his decision to have Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko resume negotiations with the president of
the secessionist republic.
	   The military maneuvers, which run until Friday, are designed to
tighten coordination between various forces to fight terrorist
attacks, free hostages, and combat smuggling _ exactly the sort of
incidents on the rise in Russia's fringe republics.
	   ``Measures aiming to maintain law and public order in the region
should be comprehensive and carried out according to a single
plan,'' said Russian Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin, according
to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Stepashin said the exercises ``do not mean that somebody is
preparing for some massive combat action.''
	   Chechnya and Dagestan have been plagued by a rise in
kidnappings, killings, and theft. Maskhadov, who declared a state
of emergency in Chechnya last month, narrowly escaped a car bomb on
Thursday that killed two of his bodyguards.
	   Forces taking part in the exercises include the Interior
Ministry, the Border Guard Service, the Federal Security Service,
and troops stationed around Stavropol, 1,200 kilometers (750 miles)
south of Moscow.
	   Yeltsin ordered Kiriyenko to meet this week with Maskhadov to
demonstrate support for his government, even though the Chechen
president led a 1994-96 war for independence from Russia that ended
in political deadlock.
	   ``The simple fact of this meeting is very important,'' Ivan
Rybkin, Russia's top negotiator with the Chechens, told the
Interfax news agency.
	   ``After a long break, negotiations between Moscow and Grozny
will occur at a high level. In that period, many bitter problems
have accumulated that can be destroyed only by the leaders of
Russia and Chechnya.''
	   Four top Russian politicians demanded on Monday that Russia
clarify its stance on Chechnya in light of increased violence in
the region, including the hostage-taking of Russia's presidential
envoy to Chechnya, Valentin Vlasov, almost three months ago.
	   Former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, former national
security chief Alexander Lebed, Tatarstan region President Mintimer
Shaimiyev and Boris Berezovsky, executive secretary of the
Commonwealth of Independent States, demanded in a statement that
the Russian government ``immediately formulate a position on the
Chechen republic and the North Caucuses ... and consistently
implement it,'' news agencies said.
	   Though Maskhadov said he favored new negotiations, he blamed
Russia for Chechnya's present situation.
	   Maskhadov also ruled out any compromise on the republic's
independence, repeating that Chechnya would never sign a document
``which might limit Chechnya's independence even by one percent,''
he told the Interfax news agency.
	   Six people have been arrested so far in connection with the car
bomb attack on Maskhadov, but by Monday afternoon three were
released, the Interfax news agency said.
	   One of the people being held is an elderly man whose apartment
was used by gunmen during the attack, Interfax said.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces cleared ethnic Albanian
rebels Monday from a key highway linking Kosovo's two largest
cities, opening a strategic route that had been blocked by
separatist guerrillas since May.
	   Serb police traveling westward from this provincial capital and
eastward from the province's second-largest city, Pec, linked up on
the highway. They displayed weapons, ammunition and other materiel
captured from the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The Serb forces joined in the village of Kijevo, 30 miles west
of Pristina. Kosovo is in southern Serbia, the dominant of two
republics that make up the remainder of Yugoslavia.
	   The offensive _ the most widespread and coordinated Serb
operation since April _ appeared aimed at clearing KLA fighters
from three strategic highways: one westward from Pristina to Pec,
another south to the town of Prizren and a third along the Albanian
border in western Kosovo.
	   If successful, the operation would split the estimated one-third
of the province under rebel control and block routes to their
sanctuaries in neighboring Albania, from which the insurgents
smuggle weapons.
	   Fighting continued Monday on the highway between Pristina and
Prizren to the south. There were no reports about fighting along
the third route.
	   Albanian analysts suggested that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic was trying to deliver a blow to the rebels before
agreeing to future talks with moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova on the fate of the province.
	   The KLA has refused to endorse Rugova's leadership because he
opposes violence to gain independence for Kosovo, whose population
of 2 million people is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
	   On Monday, Rugova's party, the Democratic League of Kosovo, said
the latest offensive ``has deepened the crisis of war in Kosovo and
will prevent a solution through dialogue.''
	   Rugova's party has appealed to the United States, the European
Union and other organizations to stop the government offensive,
which began late Friday.
	   Milosevic has offered to restore Kosovo's autonomy, which he
abolished in 1989, but he opposes independence for the Serbian
province.
	   The Americans and Europeans also oppose independence, fearing it
will lead to greater demands by the ethnic Albanians to unite with
Albanian communities in other Balkan countries and destabilize the
entire region.
	   In Tirana, the Albanian foreign ministry protested to the
Yugoslavs that cross-border fighting incidents that occurred over
the weekend were ``provocations that violated the national
integrity of Albania.'' On Sunday, both Yugoslav and Albanian
officials reporting an exchange of fire across the mountainous
frontier.

Lawmakers: police recruits should be banned from religious groups
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Recruits to Northern Ireland's
predominantly Protestant police force should be banned from
belonging to groups which restrict membership on religious grounds,
a Parliamentary committee recommended Monday in a report on
reforming the police.
	   The recommendation by the Northern Ireland Affairs Select
Committee, if accepted, would apply to Protestant organizations
like the Orange Order, whose demands to march through Catholic
neighborhoods have sparked violent protests, and Roman Catholic
groups including the Ancient Order of Hibernia.
	   The committee also called for a ban on flying the British flag
on police stations on July 12, the most important day for
Protestant marches in Northern Ireland, and strict measures against
sectarian and sexual harassment _ both within the force and towards
the public. It said urgent reform of police recruitment is needed
to make the system quicker and more open.
	   Making the 13,000-strong Royal Ulster Constabulary more
acceptable to the north's minority Catholics is a major challenge
as the British-ruled province begins to implement the April 10
accord among eight parties and the British and Irish governments.
	   Catholics make up 40 percent of the population of Northern
Ireland but only 8 percent of the police force. While many
pro-British Protestants want the police force retained as is,
militant Catholic supporters of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party
demand its abolition.
	   ``The need to address this problem is urgent and doing so will
be one of the most complex and important tasks facing the
government in the coming years,'' the select committee said.
``Without some radical change in the force it will take a
generation to redress the religious imbalance.''
	   A bill now going through Parliament will end the requirement for
police recruits to swear loyalty to the monarch and will increase
the RUC's accountability.
	   Chris Patten, Britain's last governor of Hong Kong, is heading
an Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland which
was established after the peace agreement to recommend ways of
making the force more acceptable. Its deadline is mid-1999.
	   The lawmakers said a balance must be struck between the right to
belong to a legal association representing cherished values and the
need to be seen as ``rigorously impartial.''
	   Ulster Unionist Jeffrey Donaldson, a committee member, told a
news conference he opposed any ban on membership in religious
groups because it would exclude a significant proportion of the
population of Northern Ireland.
	   ``And if we are trying to move towards an inclusive police force
in Northern Ireland, I don't think that's helpful,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greek firefighters struggled Monday to
control a forest fire scorching the slopes of Mount Olympus, the
legendary home of the ancient gods.
	   Meanwhile, dozens of other fires burned through brush and
woodlands around Greece in the most devastating seasonal blazes in
decades. In Loutraki, about 85 kilometers (50 miles) west of
Athens, homes were abandoned as fires moved toward populated areas.
	   Hundreds of hectares (thousands of acres) of forest have been
burned since the fires broke out late last week on the 2,900-meter
(9,570-foot) Mount Olympus, about 400 kilometers (250 miles)
northwest of Athens.
	   Two fire-fighting planes assisted crews on the ground on
Olympus.
	   In Kalamata, about 280 kilometers (168 miles) southwest of
Athens, two children's camps were evacuated after fires burned the
surrounding forest.
	   Though wildfires are common during hot and dry summers in
Greece, this season has been called the most devastating in
decades. Four firefighters died last week battling a fire on the
outskirts of Athens.

Pantani takes lead as Tour de France hits Alps; Ullrich fades
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more details, quotes
 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LES DEUX ALPES, France (AP) - Marco Pantani of Italy pushed
through bad weather conditions and punishing climbs to go into the
overall lead of the Tour de France Monday.
	   He moved away in the final two climbs and opening a gap over
defending champion Jan Ullrich, who dropped to fourth in the
standings and showed unusual signs of weakness.
	   Pantani was in fourth place entering the day, 3 minutes, 1
second behind Ullrich. After the finish. At the end of the day he
had a lead of 3 minutes, 53 seconds over American Bobby Julich.
	   ``I know that at 3:01 at the beginning of the day it was
posssible to come back today,'' Pantani said. ``The standings now
are important but there is still the time trial which is difficult
for me.''
	   There are two more days in the Alps with an important time trial
coming up on Saturday. In the last one, Ullrich gained 4:21 in the
first long time trial of the Tour.
	   Julich came in fifth on the day. 5:43 beind Pantani.
	   He tried to catch the Italian but couldn't come close on the
final climb.
	   ``I knew Pantani was dangerous but but I didn't think he could
do what he did today,'' Julich said.
	   ``He made us all look silly.''
	   Pantani won the Tour of Italy this year and was regarded as an
outside threat to Ullrich, although he was third last year to the
German, more than 14 minutes behind in the final standings.
	   Pantani lost nearly a year of competition in 1996 after a severe
car accident late in 1995 broke his leg in two places.
	   But Ullrich has had his problems getting in shape this year. He
was more than 10 kilos (22 pounds) overweight earlier this year.
	   Ullrich weakened in the final climb, ending up almost nine
minutes behind on the day and dropped down to fourth overall, 5:56
behind.
	   The 15th stage from Grenoble to Les Deux Alpes, 189 kilometers
(117.5 miles) with four major climbs including two rated ``out of
category'' on a scale of steepness, height and length.
	   The hills were made worse with rain and fog throughout the day.
Temperatures dipped below 10 C (50 F) after Sunday's stage was more
than 30 C (86 F).
	   It was mostly a waiting game throughout the day until the final
two climbs. Although France's Christophe Rinero and others built a
lead coming over the first two peaks, the group of favorites were
watching each other.
	   Then Pantani went into action.
	   Then, heading up the 2,645-meter (8,650-foot) Galibier mountain,
Pantani made his move.
	   He quickly left the other favorites and took off after the
Rinero group.
	   He built up a lead of almost three minutes at the top of the
mountain and even had time to stop completely and put on a plastic
jacket to protect him from the wind and cold on the descent.
	   Although Ullrich cut the gap slightly on the downhill, Pantani
moved away on the final climb to the ski station of Les Deux Alpes,
almost 1,650 meters (5,400 feet) with rain worsening.
	   Ullrich kept having trouble. He had a flat. He stopped to confer
with his team car. Two teammates arrived to help.
	   Nothing worked for Ullrich, losing more than three minutes to
Julich on the day.
	   Tuesday's stage has five more climbs but all are between 950
meters (3,106 feet) and 2,000 meters (6,540 feet) with better
weather predicted.

French government backs terminal care, but not active euthanasia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES with Roman Catholic, other comment; ADDS byline
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A French nurse who faces possible murder charges
for helping 30 elderly patients die prompted the government and
even the Roman Catholic church Monday to support rules on ending
the lives of terminal patients.
	   The debate over euthanasia rebounded last weekend when officials
said nurse Christine Malevre admitted she helped 30 elderly cancer
patients to end their lives.
	   Growing elderly populations in France and other countries have
prompted debate over how much advancing medical technology should
be used to keep terminal patients alive.
	   ``Mortal compassion'' said the front-page headline of the
leftist daily Liberation. ``Euthanasia - Don't Shoot the Nurse,''
said France-Soir.
	   Health Minister Bernard Kouchner expressed sympathy for Malevre
and said doctors shouldn't prolong patients' lives against their
will.
	   Kouchner told RTL radio that France's national health program
should include funding for ``palliative care teams.''
	   ``We need them because a third of our population will soon be in
retirement,'' Kouchner said. ``We are all mortal, and when the
moment arrives, we should not be alone.''
	   The Roman Catholic church, which opposes medically assisted
suicide, also indicated support for some kind of passive
euthanasia, or removing life support to allow a natural death.
	   ``There are degrees of suffering that are unbearable and which
could bring the desire to stop care,'' said Olivier de la Brosse, a
spokesman for the French Conference of Bishops, in a telephone
interview.
	   De la Brosse said there was ``a certain legal vacuum'' in
France. He said there should be a law ``to clarify the conditions
of halting care, but without giving doctors the right to grant
someone the right to live or to die.''
	   But there there were also new calls to legalize active
euthanasia, including from a French senator who is president of the
Association for the Right to Die in Dignity.
	   ``I obviously prefer legislating it,'' Sen. Henri Caillavet said
in an interview published in the Le Figaro daily Monday. ``That's
to say: clarity, with each person free to accept or reject it.''
	   The Malevre case ``shows yet again the risks from the lack of
legislation on euthanasia,'' said Roger-Gerard Schwartzenberg, head
of the Radical Socialist Party.
	   Some French doctors have admitted practicing euthanasia,
including prominent cardiologist-activist, Leon Schwartzenberg.
	   Euthanasia laws exist in Holland and the U.S. state of Oregon,
while other governments are considering legislation.

the 85th Tour de France.
	   STAGE: The Tour hit the Alps with the 15th stage from Grenoble
to Les Deux Alpes, 189 kilometers (117.5 miles) with four major
climbs including two rated ``out of category'' on a scale of
steepness, height and length which were made worse with rain, fog
and cool temperatures throughout the day.
	   WINNER: Marco Pantani attacked up the final two climbs and
shuffled the standings. He won by almost two minutes over Rodolfo
Massi of Italy but was almost nine minutes ahead of Jan Ullrich.
	   YELLOW JERSEY: Pantani, for the the first time in his career and
trying to become the first Italian since 1965 to win the tour when
Felice Gimondi won it.
	   HOW THE OTHERS FARED: American Bobby Julich ended up 5:43 behind
on the day and is second overall, 3:53 behind Pantani.
	   Fernando Escartin of Spain is third, 4:14 back.
	   Jan Ullrich was the big loser, dropping to fourth, 5:56 back
after leading Pantani by 3:01 entering the day.
	   TOUR TIDBIT: The Tour passed St. Jean de Maurienne the village
in 1992 where three-time Tour winner Greg LeMond stopped. It was
the first time he failed to finish a Tour de France.
	   QUOTE OF THE DAY: ``He made us all look silly.'' Bobby Julich on
Marco Pantani, who gained almost six minutes on Julich and nine
minutes on Jan Ullrich to go into the overall lead.
	   THE NEXT STAGE: The 16th stage from Vizille to Albertville, 204
kilometers (127 miles) with five climbs.

	   SANTIAGO, Cuba (AP) _ Fidel Castro accused Miami-based Cuban
exiles and the U.S. government of a decades-long terrorism campaign
to topple his government and early Monday asked President Bill
Clinton to help halt such attacks.
	   Speaking on the 45th anniversary of the assault that launched
his revolution, Castro said he hoped Clinton would cooperate in the
fight against terrorism, saying: ``We sincerely do not believe that
Mr. Clinton is capable of ordering terrorist plans against another
country.''
	   If the United States will not help, ``we will continue by
ourselves, fighting all the time necessary because we are stronger
at fighting this problem,'' the Cuban president said.
	   Castro's statements came during a five-hour speech that ended
shortly after midnight. Much of it was dedicated to his analysis of
stories published this month in The New York Times.
	   Castro presented the reports as proof of decades of U.S.-based
attempts to bring down his government, which he blamed both on the
CIA and on the Miami-based Cuban American National Foundation.
	   Clinton, he said, was ``miserably deceived'' by the foundation
and its late leader Jorge Mas Canosa into believing that it was
peaceful, rather than ``a terrorist institution.''
	   The Times articles quoted Cuban exile Luis Posada Carriles, who
once had CIA ties, as saying that his efforts to destabilize
Castro's government through last year's bombings at luxury hotels
on the island were financed by the foundation.
	   Posada later denied the newspaper reports in a television
interview, saying he never received money from foundation leaders.
Jorge Mas Santos, son of the foundation's late leader, also denied
the reports.
	   Posada has been accused in the past of terrorist acts against
Cuba, including the bombing of a Cuban jetliner off of Barbados in
1976. Posada was jailed in Venezuela in connection with the attack
that killed 73 people, but later escaped and was never brought to
trial.
	   Castro said that despite the threats against him and his
government, he was announcing his upcoming schedule for travel
around the Caribbean to give ``advance notice to all those
organizations of assassins.''
	   The Cuban government rarely gives final confirmation of Castro's
travel schedule more than a few days beforehand.
	   ``Not even in the savannas of Africa are more hunts organized
than when I take a trip,'' Castro joked, drawing wild laughter from
the crowd.
	   Castro announced that on Wednesday he will visit Jamaica, and on
Aug. 1 will go to Barbados to inaugurate a monument to those killed
in the 1976 Cuban airliner bombing.
	   Castro said that two days later, he will travel to Grenada to
remember Cuban construction workers killed at the civilian airport
when the U.S. military ousted a Marxist regime there in 1983.
Forty-five Grenadians, 29 Cubans and 18 Americans were killed in
three days of fighting.
	   The Cuban president also confirmed that he will visit the
Dominican Republican on Aug. 19.
	   Standing before the army barracks that he attacked 45 years ago
to launch his revolt against dictator Fulgencio Batista, Castro
ridiculed a report in another U.S. newspaper that said he was
critically sick last year.
	   Although he did not name the newspaper, he was clearly referring
to El Nuevo Herald of Miami.
	   ``Every once in a while they kill me off,'' Castro said. ``The
day I die, no one will believe it.''

Barnes, Mitchell suspended for drugs
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Two of the biggest names in U.S. track and field
_ shot putter Randy Barnes and sprinter Dennis Mitchell _ have been
suspended indefinitely for drug use.
	   Barnes, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist and the world indoor and
outdoor record-holder, and Mitchell, the 1992 Olympic bronze
medalist in the 100 meters, were cited Monday by the sport's world
governing body for failing drug tests April 1.
	   Barnes, who could face a life suspension, was tested in
Charleston, West Virginia, and Mitchell in Gainesville, Florida.
	   The International Amateur Athletic Federation did not officially
announce the suspensions, and the precise terms of the punishment
have yet to be determined.
	   These are two of the biggest suspensions in track and field,
following Ben Johnson at the 1988 Olympics, Butch Reynolds in 1990
and Mary Slaney in 1997.
	   Johnson is banned for life. Reynolds served his suspension and
is now competing. Slaney was cleared and is also running again.
	   IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reneiri said Monday from Monaco that
Barnes and Mitchell tested positive during out-of-competition
samples.
	   So far, only the A samples have been tested, Reneiri said.
However, that is sufficient for the IAAF to levy a suspension.
	   If their B samples are positive, the IAAF will then rule on the
severity of the punishment pending a hearing by USA Track &AMP; Field.
If the B sample is negative, they are cleared.
	   Barnes could be banned for life because this is his second
offense. He was suspended for two years starting in 1991 for the
banned substance methyltestosterone at a meet in Malmo, Sweden, in
1990. This time, the substance is androstenedione, Reneiri said.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Heaping on more anti-American rhetoric,
Greece on Monday complained that U.S. intervention on such issues
as Cyprus has served only to confuse the situation.
	   The remarks by government spokesman Dimitris Reppas add to the
barrage of criticism from Greek officials aimed at the United
States, which Greece accuses of not being harsh enough with rival
Turkey.
	   Greece contends the Clinton administration has ignored U.N.
resolutions calling for withdrawal of Turkish troops from northern
Cyprus.
	   Cyprus has been divided since the 1974 Turkish occupation of its
northern third, sparked by an attempted coup by supporters of union
with Greece. A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north is
recognized only by Turkey.
	   ``If the (U.S.) intervention has other goals, then we don't want
it,'' said Reppas.
	   On Sunday, Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos told the United
States that Greece and the region had suffered enough over the
years because of its involvement.
	   ``Leave us alone at last,'' Pangalos asked of the United States
on Sunday.
	   He added that: ``Your help, your friendship _ we have had enough
of them. Leave the people of Turkey and Greece, of the region, at
peace. Stop working for our good. We have seen this good. Thank you
very much, we have had enough.''
	   Two years ago, President Bill Clinton personally intervened at
the last minute to prevent a war between NATO allies Greece and
Turkey over a small rocky islet known as Imia in Greek and Kardak
in Turkish.
	   A series of U.S.-led efforts to solve the 24-year division of
Cyprus have failed because of Turkish Cypriot refusals to negotiate
a solution unless their breakaway state is recognized by the
international community.
	   Last May, Richard Holbrooke, the newly appointed U.S. ambassador
to the United Nations, blamed Turkish Cypriots for the latest
breakdown. But Greece has in recent days blamed the United States
for failing to wrangle concession out of the Turks.
	   Pangalos last week twice blamed for reneging on pre-election
promises to make Cyprus a top U.S. foreign policy priority. In an
unprecedented remark, Pangalos called Clinton a ``liar'' earlier in
the week.
	   Premier Costas Simitis' government has backed up Pangalos' at
every turn.
	   American Ambassador Nicholas Burns last week protested Pangalos'
remarks.

Three nuns shot to death in Yemen

	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Three nuns of Mother Teresa's order were
shot dead Monday by gunmen firing from a car passing their clinic
in the Red Sea city of Hodeida, a Yemeni government official said.
	   Police say they have arrested one of the gunmen who has
confessed to killing the nuns, one of whom was from the Philippines
and two were Indian.
	   Police said the gunman, Abdullah al-Nashri, 25, was ``unstable''
and had been admitted to the same clinic, which cares for people
with physical and mental disabilities.
	   The nuns belonged to the Missionaries of Charity and were shot
as they were leaving the clinic in Hodeida, 223 kilometers (138
miles) west of the capital San`a, the government official said on
condition of anonymity.
	   The order was established by Mother Teresa, a Nobel laureate who
died last year, and is based in Calcutta. Her successor, Sister
Nirmala, left for Yemen on Monday to visit the clinic, a
spokeswoman of the Missionaries of Charity told The Associated
Press in India.
	   The Indian and Italian ambassadors to San`a demanded that
government investigate the killing thoroughly and quickly.
	   Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh has promised to direct the
investigation, officials said. And Yemeni Health Minister Abdullah
Abdul-Wali Nasher paid a visit to the Hodeida branch of the
Missionaries of Charity to convey the government's sympathy.
	   A military plane was sent to Hodeida to bring the bodies back to
San`a, where they will be received by Indian and Filipino diplomats
as well as officials from the Interior Ministry.
	   Police said they are looking for at least two more men who were
seen in the car, although al-Nashri has said he acted alone.
	   Al-Nashri has fought in Afghanistan and Bosnia, police said. He
was married to a Bosnian woman and has two children.
	   The Calcutta-headquartered Missionaries of Charity have operated
clinics in Yemen since 1970, and its workers have never previously
been attacked, Yemeni officials said.
	   The Missionaries of Charity order has four branches in the
country's main cities, with a total of 25 workers. They help an
estimated 450 physically and mentally handicapped people.
	   The nuns were dressed in the order's traditional blue-bordered
saris. Earlier reports had said they were wearing white nurses
uniforms and caps.
	   The incident is not believed related to the ongoing battles
between Yemeni tribesmen and the government over fuel-price hikes
imposed under an reform program supervised by the International
Monetary Fund. Since the prices were raised on June 19, tribesmen

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with UNITA comments

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Alarmed by signs that Angola's fragile
peace process is unraveling, the United Nations appealed Monday to
the government and former rebels to halt their apparent slide back
into civil war.
	   Sixteen people, including five soldiers, were killed over the
weekend in ambushes and land mine explosions in the northeastern
Lunda Norte province, Angolan state radio RNA reported.
	   The government has accused the former rebel movement UNITA of
masterminding the attacks, which were the latest in a series of
reported incidents in the area. There was no independent
verification of the reports.
	   ``The situation remains unstable. There's continuing tension in
11 of the country's 18 provinces,'' U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst
said.
	   ``We're urging the two sides to show restraint and not move any
closer to conflict than they already are,'' he said after meeting
with government and UNITA officials.
	   The two sides signed a peace pact in 1994 to end their
two-decade civil war, but lingering hostility between them has
delayed the agreement's full implementation.
	   President Jose Eduardo dos Santos said this month that the
country was in a state of ``undeclared war.''
	   There are unconfirmed reports that 215 people were massacred,
including 88 who were burned alive in their huts, in the same area
last week.
	   UNITA vice-president Antonio Dembo denied that his movement was
behind the attacks.
	   ``These attacks are by rogue, demobilized soldiers who feel let
down by the peace process. They've got no jobs and nowhere to go,''
he said by satellite telephone from the UNITA base at Bailundo, 290
kilometers (180 miles) south of the capital.
	   The diamond-rich Lunda Norte province has been a flashpoint in
the past. One year ago, government and UNITA forces clashed there
in incidents which threatened to pitch the country back into war.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ runs diamond-mining operations in
Lunda Norte. The diamonds provide the movement with hundreds of
millions of dollars annually, analysts say.
	   UNITA refuses to hand over its central highland strongholds to
the government, alleging that police have committed human rights
abuses and targeted UNITA supporters in areas already handed over.
	   Dembo said that the U.N. had tabled a fresh proposal under which
the government would ``rectify its behaviour'' in those areas.
	   If by Aug. 13 UNITA is satisfied that the government has
fostered ``true reconciliation'' in the areas, the movement will
set a date for the handover of the four remaining towns, Dembo
said.

Four Saudis charged with hunting gazelles in wildlife zone
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS day in lead, no pickup

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A prosecutor charged four Saudi men Monday
with killing gazelles in a protected wildlife area on the Red Sea,
an official in the prosecutor's office said.
	   They were charged under a 1994 law aimed at protecting Egypt's
dwindling wildlife. It has only been applied seriously in the past
year after a campaign by environmentalists and newspapers to end
poaching by hunters from the rich Gulf Arab states.
	   Border patrolmen arrested the four suspects in January in Marsa
Alam, a wildlife protectorate 700 kilometers (435 miles) south of
Cairo, said the official in the prosecutor's office in Hurghada on
the Red Sea.
	   Police found two dead gazelles and quantities of gazelle meat in
a cooler in their four-wheel-drive vehicle, the official said,
speaking under customary condition of anonymity.
	   The four, identified as Khaled Awad, Moemen bin al-Dkheil,
Bandar Abdel-Salam and Khaled Nasr, denied they were hunting. They
were released on a bail of 3,000 Egyptian pounds (dlrs 880) each.
No other information on the men was available.
	   If convicted they face up to three years in prison.
	   No date for the men's trial was set, but the official said they
would be summoned soon.

Report: ministers did not violate policy on arming Sierra Leone
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Government ministers did not have a policy of
breaching the arms embargo on Sierra Leone, and violations resulted
from ``repeated and partly systematic failures of communication''
among staff, an official inquiry reported Monday.
	   The inquiry, led by Sir Thomas Legg, former permanent secretary
of the Lord Chancellor's Department, centered on arms shipments by
a British company, Sandline International, to the forces of Sierra
Leone President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, who had been ousted in a May
1997 coup.
	   Sandline said it had government permission to assist Kabbah,
despite a U.N. arms embargo imposed on the west African state. The
embargo applied to Kabbah's forces even though the United Nations
recognized his side as the legitimate government of Sierra Leone.
	   Kabbah was restored to power in March by a Nigerian-led African
force.
	   The report attributed failures to ``management and cultural
factors, but partly by human error, largely due to overload.''
	   ``The picture painted by this report is of a Foreign Office in
shambles,'' said Conservative lawmaker Michael Howard.
	   ``We already knew that ministers contradicted each other and
themselves, that officials contradicted one another and themselves
and that telegrams were lost and faxes destroyed, but the detailed
evidence in this report is almost beyond belief - letters from the
high commissioner go missing, reports from the military liaison
officer in Sierra Leone are destroyed, officials are asked to
attend to take a note ... but no note is in fact taken.''
	   The report said the British high commissioner (ambassador) in
Sierra Leone, Peter Penfold, ``should have taken steps to inform
himself more fully about the scope of the arms embargo.'' It also
said Penfold ``showed a lack of caution in his dealings'' with Tim
Spicer, a director of Sandline, and exceeded his authority in
giving Sandline approval to proceed with arms supplies.
	   The report faulted Foreign Office officials for not appreciating
the sensitivity of the matter and not bringing it promptly to the
attention of ministers.
	   The report noted that officials didn't know that the U.N.
embargo applied to Kabbah. ``This ignorance arose from repeated,
and partly systematic failures of communication,'' the report said.
	   Cook blamed the problems partly on budget-cutting by previous
Conservative governments. He said staffing on the African desks at
the Foreign Office had been cut from 430 a decade ago to 328 today.
	   ``This sharp reduction of staff at the time of an increase in
crises in Africa was part of the reason why mistakes were made by
staff under impossible pressure,'' Cook said.
	   Cook announced that he would create a sanctions enforcement desk
to insure that arms embargoes are observed, and contacts with
private military firms would be banned unless authorized.

	   Barnes, who could face a life suspension, was tested in
Charleston, West Virginia, and Mitchell in Gainesville, Florida.
	   Neither Barnes nor Mitchell was immediately available for
comment.
	   Mitchell is president of USA Track and Field's Athletes Advisory
Committee, the athletes' voice in the national governing body,
which has taken a hard stance against drugs.
	   His suspension was handed down last week and represents his
first drug offense.
	   The International Amateur Athletic Federation did not officially
announce the suspensions, and the precise terms of the punishment
have yet to be determined.
	   These are two of the most prominent suspensions in track and
field, following Ben Johnson at the 1988 Olympics, Butch Reynolds
in 1990 and Mary Slaney in 1997.
	   Johnson is banned for life. Reynolds served his suspension and
is now competing. Slaney was cleared and is also running again.
	   IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reneiri said Monday from Monaco that
Barnes and Mitchell tested positive during out-of-competition
samples.
	   So far, only the A samples have been tested, Reneiri said.
However, that is sufficient for the IAAF to levy a suspension.
	   If their B samples are positive, the IAAF will then rule on the
severity of the punishment pending a hearing by USATF. If the B
sample is negative, they are cleared.
	   Barnes could be banned for life because this is his second
offense. He was suspended for two years starting in 1991 for the
banned substance methyltestosterone at a meet in Malmo, Sweden, in
1990. This time, the substance is androstenedione, Reneiri said.
	   Mitchell tested positive for testosterone. If found guilty
following the B sample, he probably would receive a two-year ban.
	   Mitchell's suspension was handed down last week, after he
finished fifth in the Goodwill Games 100 and ran the second leg on
the winning U.S. 400-meter relay team.
	   Reneiri said the IAAF asked Mitchell to ``give some medical
explanation'' for the findings.
	   ``A few days ago, the explanation was received and the doping
commission decided to suspend the athlete,'' Reneiri said.
	   The five-member commission is headed by Arne Ljungqvist of
Sweden and includes vice chairman Frank Greenberg of the United
States.
	   Jill Pilgrim, a lawyer for the USATF in Indianapolis, could not
confirm or deny any of Monday's developments.

Russia begins military exercises near Chechnya
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reward for information about bombers, state of
emergency to end. TRIMS pvs. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia began military exercises in the Caucasus
region on Monday in an effort to ease increasing violence in its
restive southern republics of Chechnya and Dagestan, a news agency
reported.
	   The exercises follow President Boris Yeltsin's recent overtures
of support for Chechnya's government and his decision to have Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko resume negotiations with the president of
the secessionist republic.
	   The military maneuvers, which run until Friday, are designed to
tighten coordination between various forces to fight terrorist
attacks, free hostages, and combat smuggling _ exactly the sort of
incidents on the rise in Russia's fringe republics.
	   ``Measures aiming to maintain law and public order in the region
should be comprehensive and carried out according to a single
plan,'' said Russian Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin, according
to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Stepashin said the exercises ``do not mean that somebody is
preparing for some massive combat action.''
	   Chechnya and Dagestan have been plagued by a rise in
kidnappings, killings, and theft.
	   Maskhadov, who declared a state of emergency in Chechnya last
month, narrowly escaped a car bomb on Thursday that killed two of
his bodyguards. The state of emergency was scheduled to end Monday
night and Maskhadov said he would not extend it, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   Chechnya's State Security Ministry offered a 100,000-ruble (dlrs
16,666) reward to anyone who will identify the attackers and swear
on the Koran, the Muslim holy book, that they are telling the
truth, Interfax said.
	   Three suspects are being questioned, including an elderly man
whose apartment was used by gunmen during the attack, it said.
	   Forces taking part in the Russian military exercises include the
Interior Ministry, the Border Guard Service, the Federal Security
Service, and troops stationed around Stavropol, 1,200 kilometers
(750 miles) south of Moscow.
	   Yeltsin ordered Kiriyenko to meet this week with Maskhadov to
demonstrate support for his government, even though the Chechen
president led a 1994-96 war for independence from Russia that ended
in political deadlock.
	   ``The simple fact of this meeting is very important,'' Ivan
Rybkin, Russia's top negotiator with the Chechens, told the
Interfax news agency.
	   ``After a long break, negotiations between Moscow and Grozny
will occur at a high level. In that period, many bitter problems
have accumulated that can be destroyed only by the leaders of
Russia and Chechnya.''
	   Four top Russian politicians demanded on Monday that Russia
clarify its stance on Chechnya in light of increased violence in
the region, including the hostage-taking of Russia's presidential
envoy to Chechnya, Valentin Vlasov, almost three months ago.
	   Former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, former national
security chief Alexander Lebed, Tatarstan region President Mintimer
Shaimiyev and Boris Berezovsky, executive secretary of the
Commonwealth of Independent States, demanded in a statement that
the Russian government ``immediately formulate a position on the
Chechen republic and the North Caucuses ... and consistently
implement it,'' news agencies said.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Two of the biggest names in U.S. track and field
_ shot putter Randy Barnes and sprinter Dennis Mitchell _ have been
suspended indefinitely for drug use.
	   Barnes, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist and the world indoor and

	   Mitchell tested positive for testosterone. If found guilty
following the B sample, he probably would receive a two-year ban.
	   Reneiri did not know the level of testosterone found in
Mitchell's sample. The allowable ratio of testosterone to
epitestosterone (another natural substance) is 6:1. Anything above
that level merits an investigation.
	   Mitchell's suspension was handed down last week, after he
finished fifth in the Goodwill Games 100 and ran the second leg on
the winning U.S. 400-meter relay team at Uniondale.
	   Mitchell was entered in the U.S. Open at Edwardsville, Illinois,
Saturday night, but was a late scratch without explanation by meet
organizers. It now turns out, the IAAF would not allow him to
compete because of the ban.
	   Reneiri said the IAAF asked Mitchell to ``give some medical
explanation'' for the findings.
	   ``A few days ago, the explanation was received and the doping
commission decided to suspend the athlete,'' Reneiri said.
	   The five-member commission is headed by Arne Ljungqvist of

States.
	   Jill Pilgrim, a lawyer for the USATF in Indianapolis, could not
confirm or deny any of Monday's developments.
	   Neither Barnes nor Mitchell was immediately available for
comment.
	   Barnes, 32, set the world indoor record of 74 feet, 4 1/4
inches, at Los Angeles on Jan. 20, 1989, and set the world outdoor
record of 75-10 1/4 at Westwood, Calif., on May 20, 1990.
	   He also was the Olympic silver medalist in 1988, the world
championship silver medalist in 1993 and bronze medalist in 1995,
and the U.S. champion in 1989, 1993, 1996 and 1997. At the 1997
world championships, he failed to qualify for the final, finishing
14th.
	   Mitchell, 32, finished fourth in the 1998 and 1996 Olympics,
third in the 100 at the 1991 and 1993 world championships, and was
a gold medalist on U.S. 400-meter relay teams that took gold medals
at the 1992 Olympics and 1993 and 1995 world championships. He also
ran on four U.S. relay teams that set world records between
1991-93.
	   Mitchell also won the Goodwill Games 100 in 1994, the IAAF Grand
Prix 100 finals in 1992 and 1994, U.S. championships in 1992, 1994
and 1996, and the NCAA 200-meter championship in 1989 while at
Florida.
	   He had his best season in 1994 when he ran under 10 seconds five
times in six weeks.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Pressing their offensive for a
fourth day, Serb forces drove ethnic Albanian rebels from a key
highway Monday and surrounded a major insurgent stronghold near the
Albanian border.
	   Serb police and Yugoslav army troops encircled the village of
Junik, a major Kosovo Liberation Army stronghold jammed with
thousands of Albanian refugees in western Kosovo province.
	   Government forces gave civilians and KLA fighters one hour to
leave by two corridors _ one for civilians leading to police and
the other for guerrillas leading to army positions.
	   Reporters at the scene said the deadline passed with no one
leaving the village, 80 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of
Pristina. Serb and Albanian forces began exchanging mortar fire as
the reporters left the area near sunset.
	   Before leaving, reporters saw eight bodies lying near a small
stream. Police said they were shot early Monday trying to cross
into Kosovo from Albania.
	   Capping their offensive which began late Friday, Serb police
traveling westward from this provincial capital and eastward from
the province's second-largest city, Pec, linked up on the highway
near the village of Kijevo, 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of
Pristina.
	   They showed reporters weapons and ammunition they had captured
from the KLA, which had blocked the highway since May. The
government's Tanjug news agency said the road would be reopened to
routine civilian traffic as soon as barricades and booby-traps were
removed.
	   Serb forces launched their offensive late Friday to clear
strategic highways: the one from Pristina to Pec, another south to
the town of Prizren and a third near Junik along the Albanian
border in western Kosovo.
	   The aim appeared to be to split the estimated one-third of the
province under rebel control and block routes to rebel sanctuaries
in neighboring Albania, from which the insurgents smuggle weapons.
	   Albanian analysts also believed that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic wanted to deliver a blow to the rebels before agreeing to
future talks with moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova on the
fate of the province.
	   The KLA has refused to endorse Rugova's leadership because he
opposes violence to gain independence for Kosovo, whose population
of 2 million people is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
	   As fighting escalated, special U.S. envoy Christopher Hill
returned Monday to Pristina to continue efforts to cobble together
an Albanian delegation for talks with Milosevic.
	   Hill, the American ambassador to neighboring Macedonia, said the
new fighting ``simply increases the urgency of a political
solution.''
	   ``The more people who are killed, the more embittered certain
people are, the more reluctant they are to agree to any negotation
that at the end of the day has to involve a certain amount of trust
and good will,'' Hill told The Associated Press.
	   ``And trust and good will kind of go out the window when your
house has burned down and your family's been shot,'' he added.
	   Rugova's party, the Democratic League of Kosovo, echoed that
sentiment, saying the Serb offensive ``has deepened the crisis of
war in Kosovo and will prevent a solution through dialogue.''
	   Milosevic has offered to restore Kosovo's autonomy, which he
abolished in 1989, but he opposes independence for the Serbian
province. Serbia and Montenegro form Yugoslavia.
	   The Americans and Europeans also oppose independence, fearing it
will lead to greater demands by the ethnic Albanians to unite with
Albanian communities in other Balkan countries and destabilize the
entire region.

Everton signs fringe French player
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ French midfielder Olivier Dacourt
signed a four-year 4 million-pound (dlrs 6.58 million) deal Monday
to transfer from Strassbourg to Premier League soccer team Everton.
	   The 23-year-old midfielder, who was on the fringe of selection
in France's winning World Cup squad, said he was thrilled about
moving to Goodison Park this season.
	   Everton manager Walter Smith said Dacourt will bolster the
midfield strength of the team.
	   ``The midfield was an area we had to strengthen and I said that
when I came here, so I'm very pleased to make this signing,'' Smith
said Monday.
	   ``He's making a reputation for himself up to the full
international level with France.''
	   Smith also hopes to complete the signing of Scottish
international midfielder John Collins within two days after
agreeing a 2.5 million-pound (dlrs 4.11 million) transfer deal with
French club Monaco.

Palestinians reject reported Israeli withdrawal proposals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Abbas-Kahalani meeting underway, fresh
quotes, Palestinian negotiators say talks expected to resume &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is trying to bring the Palestinians back
to the negotiating table with proposals for joint security control
of a small area in the West Bank, Israeli media reports said
Monday.
	   But Palestinian officials said they would not consider any
proposals that were not in line with a U.S. initiative for an
Israeli withdrawal from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Israel has refused to accept the American initiative, and talks
on the long overdue troop withdrawal have been deadlocked for
months.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Mahmoud Abbas,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's top deputy, met secretly
Saturday night in an effort to restart the talks. A spokesman for
Mordechai said talks would resume soon, and Israeli media reports
said the Palestinians had agreed to rejoin the talks after hearing
concessions presented by Mordechai.
	   Walking into a meeting Monday with Israeli Public Security
Minister Avigdor Kahalani, Abbas said ``negotiations will be
resumed tomorrow and we'll see what will happen then.''
	   Israel has balked at turning over more than 10 percent more of
the West Bank to the Palestinians before a final peace settlement
is reached. But the Maariv newspaper said Mordechai told Abbas that
Israel was willing to share security control with the Palestinians
in another 3 percent, and that the 3 percent would be on contiguous
land _ near Bethlehem in the Judean Desert.
	   ``The redeployment must be implemented because it is an Israeli
obligation in the agreement,'' Abbas told reporters Monday.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, speaking Monday on Israel
Radio, said there had been no agreement on the 3 percent or any
other matter.
	   ``We are discussing various suggestions, but no agreements have
been reached,'' he said.
	   He said, however, that there had been a decision to restart the
talks.
	   Earlier, Palestinian negotiators said the talks would not resume
until the Israelis brought new ideas that did not contradict the
American proposal.
	   Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to Arafat, said Monday that the reported
3 percent proposals were not new and not in line with the U.S.
proposal.
	   ``If these are the ideas they bring to the Palestinian side,
then Netanyahu is sentencing the talks to failure,'' he told The
Associated Press.

Three nuns shot to death in Yemen

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Three nuns of Mother Teresa's order were
shot dead Monday by gunmen firing from a car passing their clinic
in the Red Sea city of Hodeida, a Yemeni government official said.
	   Police say they have arrested a gunman who has confessed to
killing the nuns, one of whom was from the Philippines and two from
India.
	   Police said the gunman, Abdullah al-Nashri, 25, was ``unstable''
and had been admitted to the same clinic, which cares for people
with physical and mental disabilities.
	   The nuns belonged to the Missionaries of Charity and were shot
as they were leaving the clinic in Hodeida, 223 kilometers (138
miles) west of the capital San`a, the government official said on
condition of anonymity. The nuns were dressed in the order's
traditional blue-bordered saris. Earlier reports had said they were
wearing white nurses uniforms and caps.
	   The order was established by Mother Teresa, a Nobel peace
laureate who died last year, and is based in Calcutta. Her
successor, Sister Nirmala, left for Yemen on Monday to visit the
clinic, a spokeswoman of the Missionaries of Charity told The
Associated Press in India.
	   The Indian and Italian ambassadors demanded that government
investigate the killing thoroughly and quickly.
	   Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh has promised to direct the
investigation, officials said. And Yemeni Health Minister Abdullah
Abdul-Wali Nasher paid a visit to the Hodeida branch of the
Missionaries of Charity to convey the government's sympathy.
	   A military plane was sent to Hodeida to bring the bodies back to
San`a, where they will be received by Indian and Filipino diplomats
as well as officials from the Interior Ministry.
	   Police said they are looking for at least two more men who were
seen in the car, although al-Nashri has said he acted alone.
	   Al-Nashri has fought in Afghanistan and Bosnia, police said. He
was married to a Bosnian woman and has two children.
	   The Calcutta-headquartered Missionaries of Charity have operated
clinics in Yemen since 1970, and its workers have never previously
been attacked, Yemeni officials said.
	   The Missionaries of Charity order has four branches in the
country's main cities, with a total of 25 workers. They help an
estimated 450 physically and mentally handicapped people.
	   The incident is not believed related to the ongoing battles
between Yemeni tribesmen and the government over hikes in fuel
prices under an reform program supervised by the International
Monetary Fund. Since the prices were raised on June 19, tribesmen
have blown up oil pipelines, ambushed a ministers' motorcade and
opened fire on government buildings.
	   Large parts of Yemen are lawless, inhabited by tribes who do not
hesitate to kidnap foreigners or use firearms to settle scores with
rivals. None of the kidnapped foreigners have been harmed.

U.N. tries to keep Angolan peace process alive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with UNITA comments &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Alarmed by signs that Angola's fragile
peace process is unraveling, the United Nations appealed Monday to
the government and former rebels to halt their apparent slide back
into civil war.
	   Sixteen people, including five soldiers, were killed over the
weekend in ambushes and land mine explosions in the northeastern
Lunda Norte province, Angolan state radio RNA reported.
	   The government has accused the former rebel movement UNITA of
masterminding the attacks, which were the latest in a series of
reported incidents in the area. There was no independent
verification of the reports.
	   ``The situation remains unstable. There's continuing tension in
11 of the country's 18 provinces,'' U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst
said.
	   ``We're urging the two sides to show restraint and not move any
closer to conflict than they already are,'' he said after meeting
with government and UNITA officials.
	   The two sides signed a peace pact in 1994 to end their
two-decade civil war, but lingering hostility between them has
delayed the agreement's full implementation.
	   President Jose Eduardo dos Santos said this month that the
country was in a state of ``undeclared war.''
	   There are unconfirmed reports that 215 people were massacred,
including 88 who were burned alive in their huts, in the same area
last week.
	   UNITA vice-president Antonio Dembo denied that his movement was
behind the attacks.
	   ``These attacks are by rogue, demobilized soldiers who feel let
down by the peace process. They've got no jobs and nowhere to go,''
he said by satellite telephone from the UNITA base at Bailundo, 290
kilometers (180 miles) south of the capital.
	   The diamond-rich Lunda Norte province has been a flashpoint in
the past. One year ago, government and UNITA forces clashed there
in incidents which threatened to pitch the country back into war.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ runs diamond-mining operations in
Lunda Norte. The diamonds provide the movement with hundreds of
millions of dollars annually, analysts say.
	   UNITA refuses to hand over its central highland strongholds to
the government, alleging that police have committed human rights
abuses and targeted UNITA supporters in areas already handed over.
	   Dembo said that the U.N. had tabled a fresh proposal under which
the government would ``rectify its behavior'' in those areas.
	   If by Aug. 13 UNITA is satisfied that the government has
fostered ``true reconciliation'' in the areas, the movement will
set a date for the handover of the four remaining towns, Dembo
said.

Archaeologists find that pyramid builders received medical care
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TAREK EL-TABLAWY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The workmen who built the pyramids received
emergency medical care and even brain surgery, the head of an
Egyptian archaeological team said Monday.
	   Zahi Hawas, the director of antiquities for Giza, said his
team's excavation of 20 workers' tombs near the pyramids has thrown
light on the lives of ordinary Egyptians of the Old Kingdom, which
dates back to 4,500 years ago.
	   ``This discovery provides clear evidence of worker lives _ a
chance to understand how these people lived, what they ate,'' Hawas
said.
	   Archaeologists found six skeletons. X-rays revealed what may be
the earliest evidence of brain surgery. The worker was operated on
for a brain tumor, said Hawas.
	   The leg of another worker had been amputated and he had lived
for 14 years after the operation. Tests on a third skeleton showed
what could be the earliest proof of syphilis and the hand of a
fourth skeleton was found in splints, Hawas said.
	   The ancient Egyptians were long believed to have been capable of
performing complex medical procedures, including brain surgery and
complicated births.
	   Hawas said that about 600 skeletons from two cemeteries for the
pyramid builders have been exhumed and tested. A total of 12
skeletons had splints on their hands, which had presumably been
injured by rocks.
	   ``These were not slaves who built the pyramids. They were
workers. This much care would not have been afforded to slaves,''
he said.
	   The workers were allowed to build small pyramids, made of
mud-bricks, above their own tombs, Hawas said.
	   ``The (mud brick) pyramids are like democracy. They were
available for everyone,'' he said.
	   Some tombs bore inscriptions that gave the worker's position,
such as ``Inspector of Pyramid Building'' and ``Overseer of West
Side of Pyramid.''

Police arrest two suspected rebels with explosives
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, India (AP) _ Sri Lankan police arrested two suspected
Tamil rebels found Monday carrying explosives, which authorities
believe were to be used during this week's summit of South Asian
leaders.
	   Leaders from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and the
Maldives are set to arrive Tuesday for the South Asian Association
of Regional Cooperation that begins Wednesday in the capital.
	   The suspects were arrested at Koduwatha, 15 kilometers (10
miles) north of the capital, Colombo during a check on vehicles. A
senior police official speaking on condition of anonymity said one
pound of highly potent explosive was when the suspects were being
frisked.
	   ``We are unsure if the terrorists wanted to go to Colombo or
some other place but we are definite that they wanted to use the
explosives during the SAARC summit,'' the official said.
	   Intelligence reports had indicated that the Tamil Tiger rebels
would attack targets in Colombo ahead of the summit.
	   The rebels normally attack military and government facilities,
but they also aim for civilian targets to dramatize their 15-year
campaign for a separate homeland for the country's minority Tamils.

Turkish President presses for peace force for Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish President Suleyman Demirel on
Monday pressed for the establishment of a peace force to prevent
escalation of violence in Serbia's Kosovo province.
	   In a letter sent to Balkan, European and U.S. leaders, Demirel
warned that the situation in the separatist province could
degenerate into another Bosnia.
	   ``Turkey is willing to participate in any kind of measure to
solve the Kosovo problem, including contributing to a multinational
force,'' Demirel said. The letter was made public by the foreign
ministry.
	   The Turkish Parliament, preparing to go into summer recess, has
already authorized the government to send soldiers to Albania,
which borders Kosovo, for possible peacekeeping missions.
	   Turkey has close ties with predominantly Muslim Albanians, who
comprise 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people.
	   Hundreds of people have died in Kosovo and tens of thousands of
others have fled their homes, since long-standing tensions erupted
into violent clashes five months ago, following a crackdown by
Serb-led security forces on Kosovo Albanian separatists.

Swiss block Kosovo accounts, investigate suspected arms funding
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Swiss authorities said Monday they had frozen two
bank accounts used to channel funds to ethnic Albanians in Kosovo
amid suspicions that the cash collected is used to buy arms.
	   A number of Swiss-based Yugoslav citizens are being investigated
on suspicion of financing illegal trafficking of arms to the
resistance movement in the province, the Swiss federal prosecutor's
office said in a statement. It didn't specify how many people are
involved.
	   ``Evidence suggesting that the (money collected) is not used, as
claimed, for humanitarian purposes, but rather in a reprehensible
manner, has multiplied during recent days,'' the statement said.
	   Swiss police made several arrests Monday morning after searching
three individuals' homes in eastern Switzerland, Juerg Blaser,
spokesman for the prosecutor's office, said earlier Monday. He
didn't identify those arrested.
	   In a telephone conversation with The Associated Press, Mahmuti
Bardhyl, a Swiss-based spokesman for the Popular Movement of
Kosovo, which supports the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army, said
the homes searched belong to three PMK members who are signatories
to one of the frozen accounts.
	   He didn't have any details on the other account.
	   Two of the three members, Agush Buja and Shaban Muja, were taken
to police stations for questioning, Bardhyl said. A third, Mehmet
Bislimi, was away, he said.
	   The PMK account is used to collect cash from the ethnic Albanian
community in Switzerland, which goes to fund humanitarian aid in
Kosovo, Bardhyl said.
	   He later told reporters in Geneva he didn't know whether the
money is also used to buy arms.
	   ``We haven't got the right to say to the people (in Kosovo) who
are facing a massacre that they can buy flour but not arms,'' he
said.
	   Bardhyl said hundreds of thousands of Swiss francs (dlrs) had
passed through the account since it was opened in 1993. He didn't
say exactly how much money it currently holds.
	   The PMK is planning to protest to the Swiss about the moves. The
organization's officials are already talking to lawyers, Bardhyl
said.
	   ``No one has the right to prevent us helping the (Kosovo)
Albanian population,'' he said.
	   Earlier this month, nations meeting in Germany urged
international efforts to take urgent steps to prevent funds
collected from ethnic Albanians living abroad from being sent to
finance the KLA.
	   Money from abroad supports the Kosovo rebels.

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ On his first day at work Monday, Iran's new
interior minister promised to pursue moderate policies that protect
freedom of speech and the rights of individuals.
	   The pledge by Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari to work for the political
and social reforms of President Mohammad Khatami risks
confrontation with Islamic hard-liners, who impeached his
predecessor for being too liberal.
	   Hard-liners fired the first shot in a new battle over the powers
of the Interior Ministry on Sunday by sending out vice police, who
harassed or arrested anyone found violating strict Islamic rules
that had been relaxed after Khatami took over last August.
	   Police set up roadblocks in several parts of the capital and
arrested young men cruising for dates. They also stopped women who
were not completely covered according to the Islamic dress code.
	   ``Three Islamic judges issued sentences on the spot for men who
were found harassing women,'' said Brig. Gen. Hedayat Lotfian, head
of the Disciplinary Forces that also act as the vice police.
	   Khatami's moderate faction has been locked in a power struggle
with Islamic hard-liners, who have been in power for nearly 20
years and have stalled his efforts to allow more political freedoms
and ease Islamic rules.
	   Lari told officials and reporters at the Interior Ministry that
he would work for reforms promised by Khatami.
	   ``Freedom is not something granted by the government or its
officials,'' he said in an attack on the hard-liners. ``It is a
right, and the government's job is only to make sure no one harms
that right.''
	   He also lashed out at the hard-liners for wanting a monopoly on
power.
	   ``We can't grant permission to political parties and then close
them down if their views are different from ours,'' Lari said.
	   He added: ``It is no art to allow only those to speak who agree
with us. The art is in allowing those who are against us to speak
as well.''
	   Lari wore the long robes of a cleric and the black turban that
signifies his descent from Islam's Prophet Mohammed.
	   After the 1979 revolution that ousted the U.S.-supported shah,
democracy and freedom were shunned as Western concepts in Iran. But
they have become the buzzwords of Iranian politics since Khatami
won a landslide victory in the May 1997 election.
	   His 20 million votes were seen as a protest against the
hard-liners and as a mandate for reform. But Khatami has been
bogged down by the power struggle with the hard-liners.
	   In what was widely seen as a chapter in this struggle, the
hard-line dominated judiciary put Gholamhossein Karbaschi, mayor of
Tehran and ally of Khatami, on trial for corruption. Last week a
court convicted Karbaschi of embezzlement and sentenced him to five
years in jail.
	   But Karbaschi, who is to appeal the verdict, attended Lari's
taking-office ceremony Monday.
	   So too did Lari's predecessor, Abdollah Nouri, whom hard-liners
impeached last month for allowing political gatherings and relaxing
the strict Islamic code. Hard-liners have threatened to do the same
to Lari.
	   In introducing his successor on Monday, Nouri implied Lari and
Khatami were ready for the fight.
	   ``There were some who believed that the president should step
back from his election promises, and to make a deal over them,''
Nouri said. ``But he didn't do so, and has chosen one of the best
people who believe in his political vision.''
	   Turning to Lari, Nouri said: ``Hard work and construction are
not always without problems and if someone wants to enter these
arenas, he should be prepared to put up with the problems.''
	   Nouri went out of his way to praise Karbaschi as a man who had
``chosen to work hard and contributed to the advancement of the
state'' when he could have opted for an easier life.
	   Khatami's powers are limited. The real power is in the hands of
the hard-line clergy led by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. As supreme
leader, he controls the armed forces, the judiciary, the
intelligence services and the broadcast network.
	   Normally, Khamenei gives control of the disciplinary police to
the interior minister. But Khamenei has so far withheld this
authority from Lari, as he did with Nouri, in what is seen as a bid
to stall Khatami's liberalization.

Killer of Sikh political leader sentenced to death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHANDIGARH, India (AP) _ A court in India's northern Punjab
state on Monday sentenced to death the man convicted of killing a
prominent Sikh political leader after a long drawn 13-year legal
battle, a newspaper said Monday.
	   Sant Longowal was shot dead during prayers in a Sikh temple
shortly after he signed a peace accord with then-Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi to end years of secessionist violence in Punjab.
Longowal was the president of the powerful Akali Dal party, a
prominent player in Punjab politics.
	   Gyan Singh, the accused pleaded not guilty to the assassination
charge. But Longowal was killed in front of a huge congregation of
worshipper and many witnesses identified Singh as the killer.
	   The court interrogated 125 witnesses over a period of 13 years
before arriving at its decision, the Tribune newspaper said.
	   Singh was tried by a special court set up under India's
Terrorist And Disruptive Activities Act, which gives police
sweeping powers to arrest and detain suspects.
	   Six others suspects were acquitted by the court in June.
	   Singh has been given 30 days to appeal.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian authorities on Monday returned to Swiss
authorities 14 paintings that had been stolen in 1993 from a
cathedral in Coira, Switzerland.
	   The paintings, works on wood dating from the 15th and 16th
centuries and gilded on their edges, were found in Ferrara, a
northern Italian city, by Italy's paramilitary police art theft
division.
	   The works were in good condition except for two paintings which
had been cut, apparently to sell them in parts.
	   An Italian has been arrested in the case, police said, refusing
to give more details because the case was still being investigated.

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Recruits to Northern Ireland's
predominantly Protestant police force should be banned from
belonging to groups which restrict membership on religious grounds,
a Parliamentary committee recommended Monday in a report on
reforming the police.
	   The recommendation by the Northern Ireland Affairs Select
Committee, if accepted, would apply to Protestant organizations
like the Orange Order, whose demands to march through Catholic
neighborhoods have sparked violent protests, and Roman Catholic
groups including the Ancient Order of Hibernia.
	   Meanwhile, police said that the shooting of two Catholic
brothers, Anthony Creane, 53, and Francis Creane, 49, in
Londonderry was sectarian. Six men burst into their home in a
Protestant district of the city in the early hours of Monday
morning and opened fire, shooting both in the legs. Francis Crane
was later reported to be in a critical condition in a hospital.

	   GENOA, Italy (AP) _ Flames raced through a cabin on a freighter
in Genoa's harbor Monday, killing five illegal immigrants who had
stowed away on the ship, port officials said.
	   The Lindarosa had unloaded a shipment of cars from Tunisia and
was headed to another pier for maintenance work when the fire broke
out, the ANSA news agency said.
	   Roberto Zucchi, a port official, told RAI state TV that the
victims had started the fire in hopes of escaping to freedom in the
confusion of the efforts to extinguish the blaze.
	   RAI said the five victims were among eight North Africans who
had stowed aboard in a container. Discovered before they could
disembark in Genoa, the five fled into two cabins and lit the fire,
RAI said.

Serbs take key highway in Kosovo

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Pressing their offensive for a
fourth day, Serb forces drove ethnic Albanian rebels from a key
highway Monday and surrounded a major insurgent stronghold near the
Albanian border.
	   Serb police and Yugoslav army troops encircled the village of
Junik, a major Kosovo Liberation Army stronghold jammed with
thousands of Albanian refugees in western Kosovo province.
	   Government forces gave civilians and KLA fighters one hour to
leave by two corridors _ one for civilians leading to police and
the other for guerrillas leading to army positions.
	   Reporters at the scene said the deadline passed with no one
leaving the village, 80 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of
Pristina. Serb and Albanian forces began exchanging mortar fire as
the reporters left the area near sunset.
	   Before leaving, reporters saw eight bodies lying near a small
stream. Police said they were shot early Monday trying to cross
into Albania from Kosovo.
	   Capping their offensive which began late Friday, Serb police
traveling westward from this provincial capital and eastward from
the province's second-largest city, Pec, linked up on the highway
near the village of Kijevo, 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of
Pristina.
	   They showed reporters weapons and ammunition they had captured
from the KLA, which had blocked the highway since May. The
government's Tanjug news agency said the road would be reopened to
routine civilian traffic as soon as barricades and booby-traps were
removed.
	   Serb forces launched their offensive late Friday to clear
strategic highways: the one from Pristina to Pec, another south to
the town of Prizren and a third near Junik along the Albanian
border in western Kosovo.
	   An estimated 20,000 inhabitants of villages lining the
Pristina-Pec fled into the surrounding mountains controlled by KLA,
ethnic Albanian sources said.

Barnes, Mitchell suspended for drugs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with description of banned substance in 12th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Two of the biggest names in U.S. track and field
_ shot putter Randy Barnes and sprinter Dennis Mitchell _ have been
suspended indefinitely for drug use, The Associated Press learned
Monday.
	   Barnes, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist and the world indoor and
outdoor record-holder, and Mitchell, the 1992 Olympic bronze
medalist in the 100 meters, were cited by the sport's world
governing body for failing drug tests April 1.
	   Barnes, who could face a life suspension, was tested in
Charleston, West Virginia, and Mitchell in Gainesville, Florida.
	   Mitchell is president of USA Track and Field's Athletes Advisory
Committee, the athletes' voice in the national governing body,
which has taken a hard stance against drugs.
	   His suspension was handed down last week and represents his
first drug offense.
	   The International Amateur Athletic Federation did not officially
announce the suspensions, and the precise terms of the punishment
have yet to be determined.
	   These are two of the most prominent suspensions in track and
field, following Ben Johnson at the 1988 Olympics, Butch Reynolds
in 1990 and Mary Slaney in 1997.
	   Johnson is banned for life. Reynolds served his suspension and
is now competing. Slaney was cleared and is also running again.
	   IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reneiri said Monday from Monaco that
Barnes and Mitchell tested positive during out-of-competition
samples.
	   So far, only the A samples have been tested, Reneiri said.
However, that is sufficient for the IAAF to levy a suspension.
	   If their B samples are positive, the IAAF will then rule on the
severity of the punishment pending a hearing by USATF. If the B
sample is negative, they are cleared.
	   Barnes could be banned for life because this is his second
offense. He was suspended for two years starting in 1991 for the
banned substance methyltestosterone, a kind of steroid, at a meet
in Malmo, Sweden, in 1990. This time, the substance is
androstenedione, a banned nutritional supplement, Reneiri said.
	   Mitchell tested positive for testosterone. If found guilty
following the B sample, he probably would receive a two-year ban.
	   Reneiri did not know the level of testosterone found in
Mitchell's sample. The allowable ratio of testosterone to
epitestosterone (another natural substance) is 6:1. Anything above
that level merits an investigation.
	   Mitchell's suspension was handed down last week, after he
finished fifth in the Goodwill Games 100 and ran the second leg on
the winning U.S. 400-meter relay team at Uniondale.
	   Mitchell was entered in the U.S. Open at Edwardsville, Illinois,
Saturday night, but was a late scratch without explanation by meet
organizers. It now turns out, the IAAF would not allow him to
compete because of the ban.
	   Reneiri said the IAAF asked Mitchell to ``give some medical
explanation'' for the findings.
	   ``A few days ago, the explanation was received and the doping
commission decided to suspend the athlete,'' Reneiri said.
	   The five-member commission is headed by Arne Ljungqvist of
Sweden and includes vice chairman Frank Greenberg of the United
States.
	   Jill Pilgrim, a lawyer for the USATF in Indianapolis, could not
confirm or deny any of Monday's developments.
	   Neither Barnes nor Mitchell was immediately available for
comment.
	   Barnes, 32, set the world indoor record of 74 feet, 4 1/4
inches, at Los Angeles on Jan. 20, 1989, and set the world outdoor
record of 75-10 1/4 at Westwood, California, on May 20, 1990.
	   He also was the Olympic silver medalist in 1988, the world
championship silver medalist in 1993 and bronze medalist in 1995,
and the U.S. champion in 1989, 1993, 1996 and 1997. At the 1997
world championships, he failed to qualify for the final, finishing
14th.
	   Mitchell, 32, finished fourth in the 1998 and 1996 Olympics,
third in the 100 at the 1991 and 1993 world championships, and was
a gold medalist on U.S. 400-meter relay teams that took gold medals
at the 1992 Olympics and 1993 and 1995 world championships. He also
ran on four U.S. relay teams that set world records between
1991-93.
	   Mitchell also won the Goodwill Games 100 in 1994, the IAAF Grand
Prix 100 finals in 1992 and 1994, U.S. championships in 1992, 1994
and 1996, and the NCAA 200-meter championship in 1989 while at
Florida.
	   He had his best season in 1994 when he ran under 10 seconds five
times in six weeks.

Tie in mixed match-up between Swedish golf aces
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ A tie. That was the result of Monday's
mixed competition among four of Sweden's top golfers. But unlike
most mixed competitions, the women played against the men.
	   LPGA Tour regular Helen Alfredsson, a two-time winner this year,
lost by one shot to Joakim Haeggman. Haeggman, the defending
Scandinavian Masters champion, won after holing a 10-meter
(30-feet) birdie putt.
	   In another tie, Catrin Nilsmark defeated Jesper Parnevik by one.
The competition was played over nine holes at the Arlandastad Golf
Course, 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Stockholm.
	   Helen Alfredsson and Catrin Nilsmark, an expecting mother, had a
slight advantage _ they teed off closer to the green.
	   Parnevik, who placed fourth at the British Open, had not played
for 14 days. His game showed no signs of rust, except at the first
hole when he hit the water.
	   ``She played very stable golf, scored one under par and made
virtually no mistakes. She deserved to win,'' Parnevik said about
losing to Nilsmark.
	   ``We can learn to play a little more aggressively, to attack and
be a little more daring. To experiment with more difficult shots,''
Nilsmark commented.

Moderate earthquake shake eastern Romania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ An earthquake with a preliminary
magnitude of 4.5 rattled eastern Romania on Monday, the Earth
Physics Institute said. No damage or injuries were reported.
	   The quake occurred at 18:00 p.m. (1500 GMT) in the Vrancea
region on the rim of the eastern Carpathian Mountains, 175
kilometers (109 miles) northeast of Bucharest. It lasted 1 minute
and 44 seconds and took place 140 kilometers (87.5 miles) under the
surface.
	   Each year there are at least 30 moderate earthquakes in the
region and this one is nothing of the abnormal, said Adrian
Grigore, a spokesman for the institute.
	   Romania's last big earthquake in March 1977 killed more than
1,000 people.

Illegal immigrants on hunger strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Seventy African and Arab illegal
immigrants began a hunger strike Monday to protest the Cypriot
government's decision to repatriate them.
	   They are part of a group of 107 men and women from several
African and Middle Eastern states who were rescued from a Syrian
fishing boat that was drifting off south Cyprus last month. The
ship had developed engine trouble and the would-be immigrants were
half-starved.
	   The immigrants had paid the Syrian captain as much as dlrs 5,000
each to be taken either to Greece or Italy. The boat left Tripoli,
Lebanon, on June 18.
	   Two of the passengers had died from a lack of food and water by
the time the others were rescued by a passing ship.
	   The ship brought the immigrants to the southern Cypriot port of
Limassol, where they have been staying in a hotel under police
guard.
	   The Syrian captain, Mustafa Mohammed, has been arrested and
charged with ``causing death by failing to take adequate
precautions'' and with transporting passengers on an unseaworthy
vessel.
	   The immigrants have asked for political asylum, claiming they
will be killed if they are sent back to their countries.
	   But three officials of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees,
who came to Cyprus to examine their applications, decided that only
three of the 107 immigrants qualify for political asylum.
	   The government has said it is arranging to repatriate the
remainder.

Serbs take key highway in Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Pressing their offensive for a
fourth day, Serb forces drove ethnic Albanian rebels from a key
highway Monday and surrounded a major insurgent stronghold near the
Albanian border.
	   Serb police and Yugoslav army troops encircled the village of
Junik, a major Kosovo Liberation Army stronghold jammed with
thousands of Albanian refugees in western Kosovo province.
	   Government forces gave civilians and KLA fighters one hour to
leave by two corridors _ one for civilians leading to police and
the other for guerrillas leading to army positions.
	   Reporters at the scene said the deadline passed with no one
leaving the village, 80 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of
Pristina. Serb and Albanian forces began exchanging mortar fire as
the reporters left the area near sunset.
	   Before leaving, reporters saw eight bodies lying near a small
stream. Police said they were shot early Monday trying to cross
into Kosovo from Albania.
	   Capping their offensive which began late Friday, Serb police
traveling westward from this provincial capital and eastward from
the province's second-largest city, Pec, linked up on the highway
near the village of Kijevo, 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of
Pristina.
	   They showed reporters weapons and ammunition they had captured
from the KLA, which had blocked the highway since May. The
government's Tanjug news agency said the road would be reopened to
routine civilian traffic as soon as barricades and booby-traps were
removed.
	   Serb forces launched their offensive late Friday to clear
strategic highways: the one from Pristina to Pec, another south to
the town of Prizren and a third near Junik along the Albanian
border in western Kosovo.
	   The aim appeared to be to split the estimated one-third of the
province under rebel control and block routes to rebel sanctuaries
in neighboring Albania, from which the insurgents smuggle weapons.
	   Albanian analysts also believed that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic wanted to deliver a blow to the rebels before agreeing to
future talks with moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova on the
fate of the province.
	   The KLA has refused to endorse Rugova's leadership because he
opposes violence to gain independence for Kosovo, whose population
of 2 million people is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
	   As fighting escalated, special U.S. envoy Christopher Hill
returned Monday to Pristina to continue efforts to cobble together
an Albanian delegation for talks with Milosevic.
	   Hill, the American ambassador to neighboring Macedonia, said the
new fighting ``simply increases the urgency of a political
solution.''
	   ``The more people who are killed, the more embittered certain
people are, the more reluctant they are to agree to any negotation
that at the end of the day has to involve a certain amount of trust
and good will,'' Hill told The Associated Press.
	   ``And trust and good will kind of go out the window when your
house has burned down and your family's been shot,'' he added.
	   Rugova's party, the Democratic League of Kosovo, echoed that
sentiment, saying the Serb offensive ``has deepened the crisis of
war in Kosovo and will prevent a solution through dialogue.''
	   Milosevic has offered to restore Kosovo's autonomy, which he
abolished in 1989, but he opposes independence for the Serbian
province.
	   The Americans and Europeans also oppose independence, fearing it
will lead to greater demands by the ethnic Albanians to unite with
Albanian communities in other Balkan countries and destabilize the
entire region.

Government temporarily abandons plans to lower age of homosexual
</HEADLINE>
consent

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The government said Monday it was temporarily
abandoning efforts to lower the age of consent for homosexuals from
18 to 16, bringing it in line with the heterosexual age of consent.
	   Members of the unelected House of Lords voted Wednesday 290 to
122 in favor of an amendment overturning the more powerful House of
Commons, which had already voted by 333 to 129 to make 16 the age
of consent for homosexuality. Opponents in the Lords said they
represented the feelings of most Britons.
	   Home Secretary Jack Straw said that he was ``reluctantly''
abiding by the Lords' decision because overturning it would mean
delaying the government's Crime and Disorder Bill.
	   Straw has said his priority was to ensure the bill, containing
key measures on tackling youth crime and other promises made by the
Labor party before it won national elections in May 1997, becomes
law before parliament rises for the summer recess on Friday.
	   Instead, Straw said would introduce a new bill to lower the age
of gay consent after Parliament reconvenes in October.

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ On his first day at work Monday, Iran's new
interior minister promised to pursue moderate policies that protect
freedom of speech and the rights of individuals.
	   The pledge by Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari to work for the political
and social reforms of President Mohammad Khatami risks
confrontation with Islamic hard-liners, who impeached his
predecessor for being too liberal.
	   Hard-liners fired the first shot in a new battle over the powers
of the Interior Ministry on Sunday by sending out vice police, who
harassed or arrested anyone found violating strict Islamic rules
that had been relaxed after Khatami took over last August.
	   Police set up roadblocks in several parts of the capital and
arrested young men cruising for dates. They also stopped women who
were not completely covered according to the Islamic dress code.
	   ``Three Islamic judges issued sentences on the spot for men who
were found harassing women,'' said Brig. Gen. Hedayat Lotfian, head
of the Disciplinary Forces that also act as the vice police.
	   Khatami's moderate faction has been locked in a power struggle
with Islamic hard-liners, who have been in power for nearly 20
years and have stalled his efforts to allow more political freedoms
and ease Islamic rules.
	   Lari told officials and reporters at the Interior Ministry that
he would work for reforms promised by Khatami.
	   ``Freedom is not something granted by the government or its
officials,'' he said in an attack on the hard-liners. ``It is a
right, and the government's job is only to make sure no one harms
that right.''
	   He also lashed out at the hard-liners for wanting a monopoly on
power.
	   ``We can't grant permission to political parties and then close
them down if their views are different from ours,'' Lari said.
	   He added: ``It is no art to allow only those to speak who agree
with us. The art is in allowing those who are against us to speak
as well.''
	   Lari wore the long robes of a cleric and the black turban that
signifies his descent from Islam's Prophet Mohammed.
	   After the 1979 revolution that ousted the U.S.-supported shah,
democracy and freedom were shunned as Western concepts in Iran. But
they have become the buzzwords of Iranian politics since Khatami
won a landslide victory in the May 1997 election.
	   His 20 million votes were seen as a protest against the
hard-liners and as a mandate for reform. But Khatami has been
bogged down by the power struggle with the hard-liners.
	   Abdollah Nouri, Lari's predecessor who was impeached last month
for allowing political gatherings and relaxing the strict Islamic
code, attended Lari's installment ceremony.
	   In introducing his successor on Monday, Nouri implied Lari and
Khatami were ready to challenge the hardliners.
	   ``There were some who believed that the president should step
back from his election promises, and to make a deal over them,''
Nouri said. ``But he didn't do so, and has chosen one of the best
people who believe in his political vision.''
	   Khatami's powers are limited. The real power is in the hands of
the hard-line clergy led by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. As supreme
leader, he controls the armed forces, the judiciary, the
intelligence services and the broadcast network.
	   Normally, Khamenei gives control of the disciplinary police to
the interior minister. But Khamenei has so far withheld this
authority from Lari, as he did with Nouri, in what is seen as a bid
to stall Khatami's liberalization.

Belarusians protest on anniversary of old Independence Day

	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ About 3,000 Belarusian nationalists
rallied in the capital Minsk on Monday to criticize their country's
authoritarian president.
	   They marched under the banned white-and-red national flag and
waved placards reading ``Long live independent Belarus'' and
``Freedom of speech to Belarus.''
	   The demonstrators then rallied in front of the Opera Theater to
mark the country's old Independence Day. Following a nationwide
referendum, President Alexander Lukashenko has moved the holiday to
July 3, which marks the Soviet liberation of Belarus from German
troops in World War II.
	   Speakers at the rally, organized by the nationalist Belarus
Popular Front, condemned Lukashenko, a former state farm director
who openly yearns for the restoration of the Soviet Union.
	   ``Lukashenko has canceled the main national holiday, July 27,
intentionally,'' said Youri Khadyka, deputy chairman of the Popular
Front.
	   ``He has delivered a precise strike against the national
renaissance and national self-awakening of the Belarusian people.
... We must strengthen our joint struggle for an independent
Belarus.''
	   Protesters adopted a resolution condemning a union treaty
between Belarus and neighboring Russia, which Lukashenko has called
the first step toward rebuilding the Soviet Union.
	   They also condemned Lukashenko's human rights and foreign
policies, which they said has led to the country's isolation.
	   Lukashenko has stifled press freedoms and cracked down on the
nationalist opposition, tightly controlling their activities.
	   He is currently engaged in a diplomatic dispute with several
countries whose ambassadors he is trying to evict from a compound
on the outskirts of Minsk.
	   Lukashenko said the compound is his property and it requires
sewage and water repairs. The diplomats say they cannot be evicted
from their homes under the terms of the Vienna Convention and many
have been recalled to their capitals for consultations to protest.

French government backs terminal care, but not active euthanasia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Restores Kouchner quote saying euthanasia barbaric, RECASTS
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Revelations that a French nurse helped 30 elderly
patients die sparked a debate Monday over whether advanced medical
technology should be used to keep terminally ill patients alive.
	   Health Minister Bernard Kouchner expressed sympathy for the
nurse and said doctors shouldn't prolong patients' lives against
their will. However, he called active euthanasia ``a barbaric
word.''
	   A spokesman for the Roman Catholic church in France said a
``legal vacuum'' existed in the country and urged clarifying how
doctors and nurses should care for the terminally ill.
	   The debate in France over euthanasia rebounded when officials
this weekend said nurse Christine Malevre admitted she helped 30
elderly cancer patients to end their lives.
	   ``Mortal compassion'' said the front-page headline of the
leftist daily Liberation. ``Euthanasia - Don't Shoot the Nurse,''
said France-Soir.
	   Kouchner expressed sympathy for Malevre and said France needed
pain-killing therapy, which he said was ``not developed enough in
our country.'' He said a social security budget this fall should
include funding for ``palliative care teams.''
	   ``We need them because a third of our population will soon be in
retirement,'' the minister told RTL radio. ``We are all mortal, and
when the moment arrives, we should not be alone.''
	   The Roman Catholic church, which opposes medically assisted
suicide, indicated something needed to be done to help those who
are terminally ill but can be kept alive by advanced medical
technology.
	   ``There are degrees of suffering that are unbearable and which
could bring the desire to stop care,'' said Rev. Olivier de la
Brosse, a spokesman for the French Conference of Bishops, in a
telephone interview.
	   De la Brosse said there was ``a certain legal vacuum'' in
France. He said there should be a law ``to clarify the conditions
of halting care, but without giving doctors the right to grant
someone the right to live or to die.''
	   But there there were also new calls to legalize active
euthanasia, including from a French senator who is president of the
Association for the Right to Die in Dignity.
	   ``I obviously prefer legislating it,'' Sen. Henri Caillavet said
in an interview published in the Le Figaro daily Monday. ``That's
to say: clarity, with each person free to accept or reject it.''
	   The Malevre case ``shows yet again the risks from the lack of
legislation on euthanasia,'' said Roger-Gerard Schwartzenberg, head
of the Radical Socialist Party.
	   Some French doctors have admitted practicing euthanasia,
including prominent cardiologist-activist, Leon Schwartzenberg.
	   Euthanasia has been decriminalized in Holland and the U.S. state
of Oregon, while other governments are considering legislation.

Hundreds more illegal immigrants make it to Italian shores
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RAISES number of arrivals in Lampedusa to 240 &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANCES D'EMILIO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Hundreds more illegal immigrants made it to southern
Italian shores Monday, only to be rounded up into detention
centers. The latest brawl among the unwelcome arrivals left dozens
arrested.
	   Five North Africans trying to stow away on a Genoa-bound
freighter died in a blaze aboard the ship while docked at that
port. Port authorities said the victims apparently set the blaze in
hopes they could flee during the confusion and avoid being sent
back to Tunisia.
	   In one of the holding centers, in the Sicilian port of
Agrigento, 10 police officers and three would-be immigrants were
injured before police succeeded in breaking up the melee. Police
arrested 37 of the arrivals, who are awaiting processing before
expulsion.
	   Under the European Union's open borders policy, Italy is obliged
to send home the illegal immigrants, many of whom hope to travel
through Italy to northern Europe in search of jobs.
	   A day earlier, another riot broke out, on the tiny Sicilian
island of Lampedusa, among North Africans fighting over a sandwich.
	   In the 24 hours from Sunday to Monday evening, at least 240
clandestine immigrants, most of them from North Africa but a few
from Sierra Leone as well, braved the Mediterranean in simple boats
to reach the island. Many of them slept outdoors on the dock before
being taken to a detention center Monday.

U.N. delegates dig in during fact-finding mission
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with delegation visiting massacre site &QL; 
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ A U.N. delegation on Monday visited
Algiers' Serkadji prison, site of a deadly mutiny two years ago, as
part of its fact-finding mission to this country wracked by
violence for more than six years.
	   The six-member delegation headed by former Portuguese President
Mario Soares has maintained a discreet profile since its arrival
Wednesday on a two-week visit.
	   Military-backed authorities relented to international pressure,
allowing a U.N. mission but with assurances that its job is not to
conduct a full-fledged investigation on the violence that has left
an estimated 70,000 people dead or on human rights abuses.
	   Authorities blame the violence, including numerous massacres, on
Muslim insurgents. But there have been questions as to whether the
military might not have played at least a passive role in some
massacres.
	   Prison visits by outsiders are all but unheard of, meaning the
mission was breaking new ground with its visit to Serkadji, where
nearly 100 people were reported killed in a 1995 mutiny by
prisoners.
	   It was not immediately known whether the delegation met only
with prison officials.
	   Later, the group visited Beni Messous, an Algiers suburb, which
was the site of a brutal massacre in September 1997 in which more
than 100 people died.

Fifth-seed Hrbaty out in the first round, Novak advances
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UMAG, Croatia (AP) _ Argentina's Mariano Puerta ousted fifth
seed Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia, Monday in the first round of the
dlrs 400,000 Croatian Open Umag tournament.
	   Puerta, ranked 95th on the ATP list beat the world's No. 38 6-3,
2-6, 6-4.
	   Jiri Novak of Czech Republic, ATP's No. 66, advanced to the
second round by defeating Vincenzo Santopadre of Italy, 6-2, 1-6,
6-1, ranked 118.
	   Puerta easily won the first set, making almost no wrong moves.
He lost the second set and the outcome of the match was uncertain,
as the two were well-balanced in the third set, until 5-4 when
Puerta used the match point. Hrbaty hit backhand down the line
long.
	   Novak and Santopadre's play oscillated throughout the match, but
Novak fully dominated the third set.

Lawmakers: police recruits should be banned from religious groups
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with police chief banning Union Jack at police
stations on July 12, edits and trims throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Recruits to Northern Ireland's
predominantly Protestant police force should be banned from
belonging to groups which restrict membership on religious grounds,
a parliamentary committee recommended Monday in a report on
reforming the police.
	   The recommendation by the Northern Ireland Affairs Select
Committee, if accepted, would apply to Protestant organizations
like the Orange Order, whose demands to march through Catholic
neighborhoods have sparked violent protests, and Roman Catholic
groups including the Ancient Order of Hibernia.
	   Police chief Ronnie Flanagan questioned whether the law would
permit such a ban,
	   ``Because of the perceptions which persist in Northern Ireland,
I would much prefer my members not to be members of the Orange
Order,'' Flanagan said. ``I think a very tiny proportion of members
are, and I strongly support the creation of a register.''
	   He did accept another committee recommendation: that police
stations stop flying the Union Jack on July 12, the contentious
public holiday when the Orange Order marches to celebrate an
ancient Protestant victory.
	   The committee also called for strict measures against sectarian
and sexual harassment _ both within the force and towards the
public. It said urgent reform of police recruitment is needed to
make the system quicker and more open.
	   Making the 13,000-strong Royal Ulster Constabulary more
acceptable to the north's minority Catholics is a major challenge
as the British-ruled province begins to implement the April 10
accord among eight parties and the British and Irish governments.
	   Catholics make up 40 percent of the population of Northern
Ireland but only 8 percent of the police force. While many
pro-British Protestants want the police force retained as is,
militant Catholic supporters of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party
demand its abolition.
	   ``The need to address this problem is urgent and doing so will
be one of the most complex and important tasks facing the
government in the coming years,'' the select committee said.
``Without some radical change in the force it will take a
generation to redress the religious imbalance.''
	   A bill now going through Parliament will end the requirement for
police recruits to swear loyalty to the monarch and will increase
the RUC's accountability.
	   Chris Patten, Britain's last governor of Hong Kong, is heading
an Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland which
was established after the peace agreement to recommend ways of
making the force more acceptable. Its deadline is mid-1999.
	   Meanwhile, police said that the shooting of two Catholic
brothers, Anthony Creane, 53, and Francis Creane, 49, in
Londonderry was sectarian. Six men burst into their home in a
Protestant district of the city in the early hours of Monday
morning and opened fire, shooting both in the legs. Francis Creane
was later reported to be in a critical condition in a hospital.

Tourists damage several Nazca lines in Peru
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Tourists in a four-wheel drive vehicle drove
across a section of Peru's enigmatic Nazca Lines, damaging at least
three of the lines etched in the desert sand, authorities said
Monday.
	   The tourists, who were not identified by authorities but drove a
truck with a California license plate, on Thursday bypassed
protective concrete markers and drove across the desert plain,
passing over the lines, said park guardian Hector Garcia.
	   The tourists stayed the night among the lines, leaving food and
garbage behind on the desert plain, located 250 miles (400 kms)
south of Lima.
	   The famous figures of the hummingbird, monkey, heron, whale,
spider or flower were not damaged, said district prosecutor Jose
Herrera Ramos. The tourists were not stopped and left the area.
	   The shallow lines were made well over a thousand years ago,
hundreds of years before the Inca empire, by clearing the stony
surface of the plains and exposing the whitish soil underneath.
There are thousands of Nazca lines.
	   They are one of Peru's top tourist attraction and cover a
35-mile (60-km) stretch of desert.
	   Theories proposed as to their purpose range from an ancient
calendar to a map of underground water supplies to alien landing
strips.
	   ``We hope that time, wind and blowing sand will cover over the
tire tracks on the lines. There's little else that can be done,''
said Daniel Mantilla, director of Radio Sport in Nazca.

Russia begins military exercises near Chechnya

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia began military exercises in the Caucasus
region on Monday in an effort to ease increasing violence in its
restive southern republics of Chechnya and Dagestan, a news agency
reported.
	   The exercises follow President Boris Yeltsin's recent overtures
of support for Chechnya's government and his decision to have Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko resume negotiations with the president of
the secessionist republic.
	   The military maneuvers, which run until Friday, are designed to
tighten coordination between various forces to fight terrorist
attacks, free hostages, and combat smuggling _ exactly the sort of
incidents on the rise in Russia's fringe republics.
	   ``Measures aiming to maintain law and public order in the region
should be comprehensive and carried out according to a single
plan,'' said Russian Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin, according
to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Stepashin said the exercises ``do not mean that somebody is
preparing for some massive combat action.''
	   Chechnya and Dagestan have been plagued by a rise in
kidnappings, killings, and theft.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov, who declared a state of
emergency in Chechnya last month, narrowly escaped a car bomb on
Thursday that killed two of his bodyguards. The state of emergency
was scheduled to end Monday night and Maskhadov said he would not
extend it, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Chechnya's State Security Ministry offered a 100,000-ruble (dlrs
16,666) reward to anyone who will identify the attackers and swear
on the Koran, the Muslim holy book, that they are telling the
truth, Interfax said.
	   Three suspects are being questioned, including an elderly man
whose apartment was used by gunmen during the attack, it said.
	   Forces taking part in the Russian military exercises include the
Interior Ministry, the Border Guard Service, the Federal Security
Service, and troops stationed around Stavropol, 1,200 kilometers
(750 miles) south of Moscow.
	   Yeltsin ordered Kiriyenko to meet this week with Maskhadov to
demonstrate support for his government, even though the Chechen
president led a 1994-96 war for independence from Russia that ended
in political deadlock.
	   ``The simple fact of this meeting is very important,'' Ivan
Rybkin, Russia's top negotiator with the Chechens, told the
Interfax news agency.
	   ``After a long break, negotiations between Moscow and Grozny
will occur at a high level. In that period, many bitter problems
have accumulated that can be destroyed only by the leaders of
Russia and Chechnya.''
	   Four top Russian politicians demanded on Monday that Russia
clarify its stance on Chechnya in light of increased violence in
the region, including the hostage-taking of Russia's presidential
envoy to Chechnya, Valentin Vlasov, almost three months ago.
	   Former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, former national
security chief Alexander Lebed, Tatarstan region President Mintimer
Shaimiyev and Boris Berezovsky, executive secretary of the
Commonwealth of Independent States, demanded in a statement that
the Russian government ``immediately formulate a position on the
Chechen republic and the North Caucuses ... and consistently
implement it,'' news agencies said.

Palestinians reject reported Israeli withdrawal proposals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Abbas-Kahalani meeting underway, fresh
quotes, Palestinian negotiators say talks expected to resume &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is trying to bring the Palestinians back
to the negotiating table with proposals for joint security control
of a small area in the West Bank, Israeli media reports said
Monday.
	   A senior Palestinian official confirmed that negotiations had
resumed. The Israeli media reports said the Palestinians had agreed
to come back after hearing concessions presented by Israeli
Deefense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
	   ``Negotiations will be resumed tomorrow and we'll see what will
happen then,'' Mahmoud Abbas, the top deputy to Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat told reporters on his way into a meeting Monday with
Israeli Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani.
	   Abbas and Mordechai met secretly Saturday night in an effort to
restart the talks.
	   Palestinian officials have said they would not consider any
proposals that were not in line with a U.S. initiative for an
Israeli withdrawal from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Abbas appeared to hew to that line.
	   ``The redeployment must be implemented because it is an Israeli
obligation in the agreement,'' he told reporters.
	   Israel has balked at turning over more than 10 percent more of
the West Bank to the Palestinians before a final peace settlement
is reached.
	   The Maariv newspaper said Mordechai told Abbas that Israel was
willing to share security control with the Palestinians in another
3 percent, and that the 3 percent would be on contiguous land _
near Bethlehem in the Judean Desert.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, speaking Monday on Israel
Radio, said there had been no agreement on the 3 percent or any
other matter.
	   ``We are discussing various suggestions, but no agreements have
been reached,'' he said.

 &UR; EU says French-Egyptian conference on Mideast is taking shape

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ The French-Egyptian idea of an
international conference to revive the Arab-Israeli peace process
is ``taking shape,'' the European Union's envoy to the Middle East
said Monday.
	   ``I think the visit of (Syrian) President (Hafez) Assad to
France was very useful on that (idea),'' Miguel Moratinos told
reporters after his arrival in Damascus from Jordan.
	   Assad visited Paris last week where he held talks with French
President Jacques Chirac who, with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, called in May for a conference to try to save the peace
process.
	   Israeli-Palestinian negotiations have failed to advance since
the Israeli government began building a Jewish housing estate on
the traditionally Arab side of Jerusalem in March 1997. Talks
between Syria and Israel have not taken place since February 1996.
	   Moratinos said the proponents of such a conference should
coordinate with the United States, the main broker in the peace
process.
	   ``The idea is taking shape, but it has to adapt to the different
positions of each party,'' the European envoy said.
	   ``The success of this initiative would bring the peace process
back on track.''
	   Moratinos, who was in Israel last week, said he would be
discussing ideas on the peace process with Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouk al-Sharaa.
	   Moratinos leaves Tuesday for Lebanon and will return to Israel
later in the week.

Former Peruvian official asks Venezuela for political asylum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ A former minister in President Alberto
Fujimori's Cabinet who faces tax evasion charges has asked
Venezuela for asylum, charging government officials with political
harassment.
	   Guido Pennano, who was Industry Minister for several months in
1990 at the start of Fujimori's government, took refuge in the
Venezuelan embassy Sunday night, two days after being released on
bail for tax evasion charges. He had spent 12 days in prison.
	   Following his release, a Lima court quickly issued another
arrest order and he fled to the embassy.
	   ``Given the insecurity, pressures and threats, I have no option
but ask a friendly country for protection,'' Pennano told reporters
before requesting asylum.
	   The government has charged that two of Pennano's companies
failed to pay dlrs 400,000 in taxes in 1996 and 1997.
	   ``We trust that the government of Venezuela will not grant him
asylum because the case is not political and there is no political
persecution,'' Foreign Minister Eduardo Ferrero told reporters on
Monday.
	   Pennano, who remained in the embassy Monday, has denied that he
failed to pay taxes and said the charges were a reprisal against
him for his criticism of government officials following his
resignation as minister.
	   He left Fujimori's government in 1990 due to differences over
economic policy and criticized top officials repeatedly in a
television show he hosted.
	   Pennano had been in hiding since January when the charges
against him were first made. He turned himself in on July 13.
	   The Venezuelan government has not said if it will grant him
asylum.

Judge orders priest continued held in bishop's slaying
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A priest arrested in the murder of a
prominent bishop was ordered held in prison on Monday while
prosecutors collect evidence against him.
	   Investigating Judge Isaias Figueroa Medina issued the order
against Mario Orantes, whose arrest last week shocked the country.
He is accused of killing Bishop Juan Gerardi, though a gag order on
those involved in the case has left the alleged motive a mystery.
	   Also ordered held was Margarita Lopez, a church cook accused of
covering up the slaying.
	   Orantes, 39, reported finding the bishop's bludgeoned corpse on
April 26 at the San Sebastian church, where both lived.
	   Suspicion for the crime had fallen on right-wing death squads
because the killing came two days after Gerardi, head of a church
human rights office, had issued a major report blaming the military
and associated groups for most of the killings in Guatemala's civil
war of 1960-1996.
	   Figueroa's order gives prosecutors as much as three months to
provide evidence to determine whether Orantes should be formally
tried.
	   Also being held in the case is a civilian named Carlos Enrique
Vielman, who was arrested April 30.

Iraq nuclear report says intrusive, long-term monitoring necessary
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. inspectors have found no evidence
that Iraq is trying to maintain its nuclear program but suggested
in a report Monday that an ongoing monitoring program be rigorous
and intrusive to verify that no such program exists.
	   Baghdad continues to conceal information about its nuclear
abilities and hasn't given inspectors proof to back up claims that
it abandoned its nuclear program, according to the report from the
International Atomic Energy Agency.
	   The report was scheduled to be considered later this week by the
Security Council, where Russia has sought to end inspections in
favor of less intrusive ``passive monitoring'' of known Iraqi
research facilities.

	   In May, the Security Council agreed to put off any decision on a
scaleback until Iraq made ``substantive clarifications'' about its
nuclear weapons program, which Iraq claims to have dismantled in
1991, when the inspections began under terms for ending the Gulf
War.
	   The council asked the IAEA to report back to them by July ``for
possible action at that time.'' Otherwise, the issue could come up
again after its next regular report in October.
	   Monday's report, however, appeared to shed little new light on
Iraq's program. It did, however, repeat previous assertions that
inspectors have found no evidence of a continued nuclear program.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian elections officials
postponed the release Monday of preliminary results from
parliamentary elections, prompting allegations of fraud from a
challenger to strongman Hun Sen.
	   ``We are moving into a very dangerous game. They want to buy
time, they want to arrange the result of the election,'' said Sam
Rainsy, a popular former finance minister and leading opposition
figure.
	   But the group coordinating 678 international observers
monitoring the elections said after hours of deliberations that it
believed the delays were purely technical and that the voting
process was free and fair.
	   More than 90 minutes after the results from Sunday's vote were
to be announced, election officials told party activists,
journalists and human rights workers in a packed meeting room that
incomplete documents and communications problems had forced a delay
until Tuesday morning.
	   ``These results are not clear enough to be released,'' said
Samraing Kimsain, spokesman for the National Election Committee,
which is dominated by Hun Sen supporters. ``We want to wait for
more clear information and hope to release the results tomorrow,
step by step.''
	   Near midnight, the Joint International Observers Group issued a
declaration saying ``all parties should accept and honor the
results of the election without any attempt to undermine the
original outcome.''
	   The endorsement was a major boost for Hun Sen, who called the
election to regain the international legitimacy and aid Cambodia
lost after he deposed his co-premier, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in
a coup last year.
	   But if a victory by Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party is not
accepted by the opposition or the millions who waited in line to
cast ballots, the outcome could be more turmoil for a nation that
has suffered 30 years of civil war and the Khmer Rouge genocide of
the late 1970s.
	   The three major parties each claimed sweeping victories
throughout the day as members reported results from various
locations, but the violence-marred election campaign and Hun Sen's
steps to pack key posts with his backers had long raised
expectations that the final figures would show victory for his
party.
	   ``I think I have to wait for the results, but the delay makes me
nervous,'' said Lu Laysreng, a candidate for Ranariddh's opposition
party.
	   With no party likely to garner two-thirds of the seats necessary
to control the legislature, a period of uncertainty was likely to
follow the balloting as Hun Sen and his two bitter rivals tried to
put together a coalition government.
	   At least 90 percent of the 5.4 million registered voters cast
ballots Sunday, showing faith in the democratic process.
	   But U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warned that
process could still unravel.
	   ``The real test of Cambodia's democracy will come after the
ballots are counted,'' she said in Manila, Philippines, where she
was attending a meeting of top regional officials.
	   When the United Nations sponsored Cambodian elections in 1993
backed by 20,000 peacekeepers, Ranariddh's party finished atop the
vote. The Cambodian People's Party, which had ruled a single-party
state under the harsh Vietnamese military occupation that followed
the Khmer Rouge regime, was surprised to finish second.
	   Hun Sen refused to accept the result and threatened civil war,
forcing his way into a co-premiership. The tense arrangement was
shattered last year when he sent tanks into the streets to depose
Ranariddh.
	   During the election campaign, the opposition was denied access
to the media, party workers were killed, beaten and threatened, and
voters were intimidated.
	   Election day was not free of violence, either. An attack on a
military outpost by die-hard remnants of the Khmer Rouge left 10
people dead.

Government says it will reform immigration policy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The government said Monday it will modernize and
streamline Britain's immigration procedures to stamp out ``blatant
and often cynical abuse'' by asylum seekers and offer a quicker
service.
	   Home Secretary Jack Straw told the House of Commons he wanted to
make the immigration service worked ``fairer, faster and firmer,''
and said the current system was a ``shambles.''
	   Among proposals listed in a white paper unveiled by Straw Monday
were establishing a single right of appeal for asylum seekers,
introducing a statutory scheme to regulate unscrupulous immigration
advisers and ensuring asylum seekers who are refused permission to
stay in Britain are returned quickly to their country of origin.
	   Straw said that the current immigration system was under
pressure due to growing numbers of economic refugees, and was
vulnerable to unscrupulous immigrants.
	   The number of asylum seekers has increased eightfold in the past
decade, from 4,000 to 34,000 last year, costing the taxpayer 500
million pounds (dlrs 800 million) a year, and although three
quarters of asylum applications are refused outright, Straw said,
the lengthy appeals process means many cases drag on for years.
	   ``Huge backlogs have developed. Perversely, it is the genuine
applicant who has suffered while abusive claimants and racketeers
have profited,'' Straw said.
	   To cut through bureaucracy, Straw said about 10,000 asylum
seekers who have been waiting since 1993 for their cases to be
heard, and a further 20,000 waiting since 1995, are likely to be
told they can stay in Britain, although Straw said he was not
declaring an amnesty for the total backlog of 52,000 cases.

Citibank is to pull out of Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The American banking giant Citibank is to
withdraw from Sudan after failing to receive an exemption from U.S.
trade sanctions against the country.
	   The decision to close Citibank's Khartoum branch came after the
bank received new instructions from the U.S. government that it
could not accept any trade accounts, investments and financial
activities related to imports and exports, Citibank said in a
statement issued here.
	   Washington imposed sanctions on Sudan in Nov. 1997 on the
grounds that its military-backed, Islamic fundamentalist government
was supporting international terrorism and aided an assassination
attempt against Egypt's president in 1995.
	   The United States has frozen Sudanese assets, blocked trade with
Khartoum and banned American investment in the country.
	   Sudan has denied Washington's accusations.
	   Mohammed al-Hassan, the governor of the National Bank of Sudan,
the central bank, said Citibank's Khartoum branch found itself
unable to utilize assets and deposits made by government companies
and institutions.
	   ``The greatest source of concern is that Citibank ... has been
withholding huge assets in local and foreign currencies which were
frozen because it is forbidden to engage in banking and financial
activities,'' al-Hassan said in a statement.

SPLA: Donors should investigate inefficiency, corruption in U.N.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Denying charges that his forces are
stealing aid intended for starving refugees, the spokesman for a
Sudanese rebel group said donors should instead investigate the
U.N. aid agency in charge of aid distribution.
	   The head of UNICEF, which coordinates Operation Lifeline Sudan,
said she would look into the charges
	   Pa'gan Amum, the spokesman for the Sudan People's Liberation
Army, charged said the OLS, an umbrella organization for U.N. and
private relief agencies, was rife with inefficiency and corruption.
	   Amum told a press conference that OLS spends large sums of money
on a ``large and expensive bureaucracy of expatriates'' at its base
in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, as well as at its base in the
northwestern Kenya town of Lokichokio and in southern Sudan.
	   He said the OLS operation in Lokichokio costs dlrs 3 million a
year to run, a figure confirmed last week by OLS.
	   Amum said OLS employees inflate the cost of food and supplies
purchased in Kenya and Uganda in order to take kickbacks.
	   Amum also denied claims by U.N. officials that the SPLA has been
diverting relief food to rebels _ saying the food is distributed by
OLS agents and not the rebels _ and dismissed reports that the SPLA
collected ``tax'' in the form of relief food from the civilian
population in southern Sudan.
	   ``If that is happening, it is an individual doing it and not the
movement,'' Amum said.
	   Bahr el-Ghazal province is the worst hit by the war-induced
famine in Sudan. The United Nations says of the 2.6 million people
in need in Sudan _ the largest nation in Africa _ 700,000 are
targeted to receive relief food in the southwestern province.
	   UNICEF's executive director, Carol Bellamy, acknowledged the
possibility that there was inefficiency in the operation simply
because of its size. She said she took the rebels' allegations of
corruption very seriously and had pledged to look into the matter.
	   ``I believe we have to take this seriously, but I have not been
at this point, shown any information to back up (the charges) from
those that have issued the statement,'' Bellamy told a news
conference in New York.
	   Amum's accusation came as the Rome-based U.N. World Food Program
appealed to donors for an additional 46,500 metric tons of
emergency food for the coming year. In April, WFP appealed for
85,000 metric tons it said were needed through April 1999.
	   The agency also asked for dlrs 154.5 million to cover
operational costs through April.
	   At least 1.5 million people have died since the second round of
a civil war broke out in 1983 between the government and the SPLA.
	   The SPLA wants greater autonomy for the predominantly Christian
and animist south, traditionally controlled by the Arab, Islamized
north.

Woman who said Castro ill appeals for asylum

<TEXT>
	   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) _ A woman who said Fidel Castro
suffered a brain disease last year appealed Monday for political
asylum and scoffed at the Cuban president's denial of her claims.
	   ``Yes, the comandante was hospitalized,'' Elizabeth Trujillo
said in her first public appearance. ``Fidel Castro has 36 years
lying to the Cuban people.''
	   Speaking to reporters after meeting Foreign Minister Roberto
Rojas, Trujillo repeated statements she had made to the Miami
newspaper El Nuevo Herald. She identified herself as a doctor who
worked at a Havana hospital where Castro had been treated last
October for hypertensive encephalopathy, or high blood pressure
around the brain.
	   The Herald's July 19 report brought an unusual direct response
from Castro himself, who told reporters in Cuba last week that it
was ``a lie from head to tail.''
	   He denied he had suffered from the disease or that he had been
at the hospital. He said Cuban investigators had determined that
Trujillo was not a doctor, did not work at the hospital in question
and was not even in Cuba at the time.
	   News reports also noted that Castro had met with the Vatican's
chief spokesman, Joaquin Navarro Vals, for six hours during the
days he was alleged to be hospitalized and heavily drugged.
	   ``Anything is possible because there was no control over exits''
from the hospital, Trujillo said Monday.
	   She said she planned to live in Costa Rica and said the
government had offered protection. She says she has been in hiding
here since April.
	   Rojas told reporters the government would help her legalize her
status and suggested she might be given refugee status.
	   Castro in Sunday's speech again denied the report of his
illness.
	   ``I almost have fun with all this news,'' Castro said. ``Every
once in a while they kill me off. The day I die, no one will
believe it.''

Iraq nuclear report says intrusive, long-term monitoring necessary
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES previous; RECASTS. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. inspectors have found no evidence
that Iraq is trying to maintain its nuclear program and suggested
in a report Monday that a rigorous and intrusive monitoring program
continue to try to verify that no such program exists.
	   Baghdad continues to conceal information about its nuclear
abilities and hasn't given inspectors proof to back up claims that
it abandoned its nuclear program in 1991, according to the report
from the International Atomic Energy Agency.
	   The report was scheduled to be considered later this week by the
Security Council, where Russia has sought to end inspections in
favor of less intrusive ``passive monitoring'' of known Iraqi
research facilities.
	   In May, the Security Council agreed to put off any decision on a
scaleback until Iraq made ``substantive clarifications'' about its
nuclear weapons program.
	   The council asked the IAEA to report back to them by July ``for
possible action at that time.'' Otherwise, the issue could come up
again after its next regular report in October.
	   Monday's report, however, appeared to shed little new light on
Iraq's program and it was unclear if the United States would
acknowledge that the IAEA had done all it could do, which some
council diplomats have suggested.
	   Baghdad must destroy all weapons of mass destruction before the
council will lift crippling economic sanctions imposed in 1990
after President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, triggering the Gulf
War.
	   While acknowledging progress in the nuclear field, the United
States has argued against declaring the issue closed, saying Iraq
has still not answered all the U.N. nuclear agency's questions
about its clandestine program.
	   The report noted Baghdad's ``lack of full transparency in the
provision of information, which has resulted in uncertainties
regarding the extent of external assistance to Iraq's clandestine
nuclear program and Iraq's actual achievements in some aspects of
that program.''
	   Despite its inspections, the IAEA cannot ``provide absolute
assurance of the absence of readily concealable items, such as
components of centrifuge machines or copies of weapon-related
documentation,'' the report said.
	   The IAEA is expanding its activities into a widespread
monitoring program but such a program ``must be comprehensive and
rigorous and, as a result, is intrusive,'' the report said.
	   It warned against any reduction or interference with inspectors'
rights and called for member states to stand ready to contribute to
the estimated dlrs 9 million it will cost to expand the monitoring
system.

Goodwill Games swimming starts Tuesday with unusual team format.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BILL BARNARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ On the list of grueling sports
events, the 50-meter freestyle ranks just above marbles and
tiddlywinks, and that's why Bill Pilczuk likes it.
	   ``I'm aerobically challenged,'' America's fastest swimmer said
Monday. ``The 100 is just too long for me.''
	   Pilczuk failed to make the 1996 Olympics, but he finally made a
splash internationally in January when he broke Russian Aleksandr
Popov's seven-year unbeaten string and won the world championship
in Perth, Australia.
	   The two rivals meet again at the Goodwill Games, although the
dual-meet format will have them both racing in the 50 twice against
other teams before they swim against each other Saturday.
	   ``I look at this as more of a fun matchup,'' said Pilczuk, of
Auburn, Ala. ``The only real big races are the Olympics and the
world championships. I feel like I won the big rivalry race this
year, and the next one isn't until the Olympics. He (Popov) might
look at it differently since I beat him this year.''
	   Popov, the world record-holder for 100 meters, is regarded as
something of a distance swimmer by Pilczuk, who doesn't bother
swimming anything but the 50.
	   Most of the Americans are looking ahead to the U.S. national
championships in Clovis, California as the most important of the
summer. Teams for four international meets in 1999 will be selected
based on the Clovis results.
	   ``This is a low-key meet for us,'' Pilczuk said. ``I think for
the foreign teams, they regard it as the biggest meet of the
summer.''
	   The U.S. women will swim against China on Tuesday, an
international All-Star team on Thursday and Germany on Saturday.
	   The U.S. men will face Germany on Wednesday, an All-Star team on
Friday and Russia on Saturday.
	   The men's All-Star team has swimmers from Cuba, Puerto Rico,
South Africa, France, Italy, Brazil, Canada, Hungary, Britain,
Venezuela, Ukraine and the Netherlands.
	   The women's All-Star team is from South Africa, France, Ukraine,
Russia, Egypt, Japan, Slovakia, Costa Rica, Spain, New Zealand and
the Netherlands.
	   ``This format gives me three chances on three different days to
prove myself, and if I have a bad day, I can make up for it,''
Pilczuk said.
	   The Goodwill Games also provides prize money, a rarity in
swimming. A world record is worth dlrs 50,000, but most of the
Americans have not tapered their training enough to make world
records likely.
	   ``It would be nice, but you don't get into swimming for the
money, you do it for fun,'' said Lenny Krayzelburg of Los Angeles,
who won the 100 and 200 backstroke at the World Championships.
``You might see more swimmers go for it on the international teams
if they prepared for this meet. Sometimes records just happen when
you don't expect them, but most of the U.S. team is pointing for
the nationals.''
	   Krayzelburg, who moved with his family to the United States from
Ukraine 10 years ago when he was 13 and became a U.S. citizen six

Farid Shawqi, Egypt's ``King Of The Screen,'' dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Farid Shawqi, the Egyptian actor known as
the ``King of the Screen'' died Monday night. He was 76.
	   Shawqi died in a Cairo hospital where he had been connected to a
pacemaker for several days, the Egypt's official Middle East News
Agency said.
	   His funeral will be held at noon Tuesday, Egyptian television
said.
	   Shawqi had been sick for a number of years and underwent several
heart operations abroad.
	   Egyptian state-run television mistakenly announced his death,
interrupting its programs, on June 17. Shawqi's family protested,
and the Information Minister sacked the head of the channel.
	   Shawqi was well known in the Arab world for playing the tough
guy.
	   He began his career in 1949 and got his first break as the
second male lead in ``The Angel of Mercy.'' In 1951 he starred in
the film Ista Hassan, or Foreman Hassan, by director Salah Abu
Seif.
	   He went on to act in more than 400 films during the golden days
of Egyptian movie-making. He also acted in a large number of
television series, stage plays and radio soap operas.
	   A heavy-set actor, Shawqi was the favorite star of low-income
earners, which earned him the title of ``King of the Front Rows'' _
where the cheapest tickets are.
	   Among his best known films are ``They Made Me a Criminal,''
directed by Atef Salem, and ``The Bully,'' by Salah Abu Seif, which
took a prize at the Berlin Cinema Festival in 1956.
	   Together with a group of Egyptian actors, Shawki set up a
private film company that produced movies and owned cinemas.
	   He was married to Huda Sultan, an Egyptian actress and singer,
but he divorced her to marry the belly dancer Soheir el-Turk.
	   He is survived by four daughters, two from each wife.

Report: ministers did not violate policy on arming Sierra Leone

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Government ministers did not have a policy of
breaching the arms embargo on Sierra Leone, and violations resulted
from ``repeated and partly systematic failures of communication''
among staff, an official inquiry reported Monday.
	   The inquiry, led by Sir Thomas Legg, former permanent secretary
of the Lord Chancellor's Department, centered on arms shipments by
a British company, Sandline International, to the forces of Sierra
Leone President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, who had been ousted in a May
1997 coup.
	   Sandline said it had government permission to assist Kabbah,
despite a U.N. arms embargo imposed on the west African state. The
embargo applied to Kabbah's forces even though the United Nations
recognized his side as the legitimate government of Sierra Leone.
	   Kabbah was restored to power in March by a Nigerian-led African
force.
	   The report attributed failures to ``management and cultural
factors, but partly by human error, largely due to overload.''
	   ``The picture painted by this report is of a Foreign Office in
shambles,'' said opposition Conservative lawmaker Michael Howard in
a parliamentary debate.
	   ``We already knew that ministers contradicted each other and
themselves, that officials contradicted one another and themselves
and that telegrams were lost and faxes destroyed, but the detailed
evidence in this report is almost beyond belief - letters from the
high commissioner go missing, reports from the military liaison
officer in Sierra Leone are destroyed, officials are asked to
attend to take a note ... but no note is in fact taken.''
	   The report said the British high commissioner (ambassador) in
Sierra Leone, Peter Penfold, ``should have taken steps to inform
himself more fully about the scope of the arms embargo.'' It also
said Penfold ``showed a lack of caution in his dealings'' with Tim
Spicer, a director of Sandline, and exceeded his authority in
giving Sandline approval to proceed with arms supplies.
	   The report faulted Foreign Office officials for not appreciating
the sensitivity of the matter and not bringing it promptly to the
attention of ministers.
	   The report noted that officials didn't know that the U.N.
embargo applied to Kabbah. ``This ignorance arose from repeated,
and partly systematic failures of communication,'' the report said.
	   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook blamed the problems partly on
budget-cutting by previous Conservative governments. He said
staffing on the African desks at the Foreign Office had been cut
from 430 a decade ago to 328 today.

Sainz wins Rally of New Zealand
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: adds quotes, new details throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Carlos Sainz put memories of stray
sheep out of his mind as he won an epic battle with Toyota teammate
Didier Auriol of France in the Rally of New Zealand on Monday.
	   The margin of victory was 4.1 seconds after 388 kilometers (242
miles) of special stages over three days on North Island roads made
treacherous by bad weather.
	   The win promoted the 36-year-old Spaniard to the lead in the
world drivers' championship with 41 points, three ahead of
Scotland's Colin McRae, who finished fifth in his Subaru.
	   It also made Sainz the most successful driver in world
championship history with 22 individual rally victories.
	   Last year, Sainz hit a sheep on the first stage of the day,
stalling his challenge for first place.
	   This time the early disappointment was Auriol's. The Frenchman
lost his 30-second overnight lead when he spun on the Te Koraha
stage.
	   From then on the teammates exchanged the lead twice before the
Spaniard edged ahead on the Whaanga Coast stage, a lead which he
increased slightly on the final short stage.
	   The Toyota one-two finish took the team to the lead in the
manufacturers' championship ahead of Subaru.
	   ``The win is both important and special for me,'' said Sainz.
``To set a new record of WRC wins is very nice, but it is just as
important to score victory at this stage of the championship.
	   ``It was never going to be easy and Didier drove superbly for
the whole rally. We both lost some time with a wrong tire choice
early in the day but our fight to the finish was a fair one.''
	   Auriol, who is now fourth in the championship, admitted that
going first on the road on the final day became a problem as the
weather cleared and the roads dried.
	   ``I was disappointed to lose time on the first stage today,''
said Auriol. ``The engine seemed to cut out and I spun in a left
bend and then took some time getting back on the road.''
	   Behind the Toyotas, defending world champion Tommi Makinen
finished third 1:39 behind Auriol. Then followed Juha Kankkunen and
McRae.
	   McRae won the first stage of the day by five seconds and then
effectively dropped out of contention with a puncture on the next
stage. The puncture sealant in the tire didn't work and with the
spare removed for lightness he had to drive 20 kilometers (12
miles) on the rim. (djp)

Canada's ailing loonie now worth just two-thirds of U.S. dollar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ For the first time in its 140-year history, the
Canadian dollar's value fell Monday to less than two-thirds of the
U.S. dollar, fueling debate over the federal strategy of passively
riding out the plunge.
	   The Canadian dollar closed in Toronto at 66.51 U.S. cents, down
from 66.71 cents Friday. One U.S. dollar was valued at dlrs 1.5035
in Canadian currency.
	   Known as the loonie because of a loon pictured on the dlrs 1
coin, the Canadian dollar has been weak for months because of the
Asian financial crisis. It has set record lows almost daily for the
past two weeks.
	   Yet, the Bank of Canada has refused to raise interest rates to
bolster the dollar, and Prime Minister Jean Chretien's government
has rejected calls to take other countermeasures.
	   Opposition politicians denounce the authorities' passive stance.
	   ``Every time the prime minister comes out and says, `We don't
mind a low dollar, it improves our exports,' it suggests the
government may actually have a policy of devaluation,'' said
Parliament member Jason Kenney, finance spokesman for the
right-wing Reform Party. ``This sends a bizarre message to currency
markets.''
	   But many economists have praised the Bank of Canada's do-nothing
strategy, saying the loonie's problems stem from the Asian crisis
and falling global commodity prices rather than any basic flaw in
the Canadian economy.
	   ``It strikes me as market forces at work, and the bank _ I think
wisely _ is letting them work unimpeded,'' said Mark Mullins, chief
economist at Midland Walwyn Capital Corp.
	   The head of Canada's largest labor federation agreed.
	   ``For once the Bank of Canada has got it right,'' said Bob
White, president of the Canadian Labor Congress. ``It would be a
profound mistake to attempt to prop up the dollar through higher
interest rates which could well plunge us back into a recession.''
	   Though outright recession seems unlikely for now, recent
projections suggest Canada's economic expansion is slowing.
	   In the first quarter of this year, the gross domestic product
was growing at a 3.7-percent annual pace. Analysts now expect a
growth rate of about 2.5 percent for the second quarter.
	   In early 1997, the loonie was worth nearly 75 U.S. cents, but
plunged to under 69 cents in January.
	   The drop has been hard on Canadians traveling to the United
States, but a boon for Canadian merchants near the U.S. border who
have enjoyed a surge of business from bargain-hunting Americans.
	   Some Canadian exporters have enjoyed higher profits because
their products are now cheaper for U.S. companies. But prices of
imported U.S. goods, such as fruit and vegetables from the Sun Belt
states, are becoming more expensive.

Wreckage of Mexican presidential staff plane found
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JALAPA, Mexico (AP) _ Search teams reported Monday they have
found the wreckage of a small aircraft belonging to President
Ernesto Zedillo's military staff which crashed in a remote mountain
area last week.
	   Red Cross workers from the state of Veracruz said that pieces of
the plane had been located about 125 miles (200 kilometers) east of
Mexico City, and that there apparently were no survivors among the
two-man crew and six presidential guards aboard the SkyVan
eight-seater.
	   The crash occured Thursday in mountains near the 17,391-foot
(5,300-meter) Pico de Orizaba, Mexico's tallest peak.
	   A three-day search for the plane had been delayed by persistent
rains, but searchers were able to locate the plane's flight data
recorder, which may yield clues to the cause of the crash.

Iraq nuclear report says intrusive, long-term monitoring necessary
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with diplomats saying no action expected, council
taking it up Wednesday, report notes some improvement. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. inspectors have found no evidence
that Iraq is trying to maintain its nuclear program and suggested
in a report Monday that a rigorous and intrusive monitoring program
try to verify that no such program exists.
	   Though noting some clarifications, the report said Iraq
continues to conceal information about its nuclear abilities and
hasn't given inspectors proof to back up claims that it abandoned
its nuclear program in 1991.
	   The International Atomic Energy Agency report was scheduled to
be considered Wednesday by the Security Council, where Russia has
sought to end inspections in favor of less intrusive ``passive
monitoring'' of known Iraqi research facilities.
	   In May, faced with U.S. objection to the Russian proposal, the
Security Council agreed to put off any decision on a scaleback
until Iraq made ``substantive clarifications'' about its nuclear
weapons program.
	   The council asked the IAEA to report back to them by July ``for
possible action at that time.'' Otherwise, the issue could come up
again after its next regular report in October.
	   Monday's report, however, appeared to shed little new light on
Iraq's program and it was unclear if the United States would
acknowledge that the IAEA had done all it could do, which some
council diplomats have suggested.
	   Council sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was
unlikely the council would take any action on the report and would
instead wait for the regular October review.
	   Baghdad must destroy all weapons of mass destruction before the
council will lift crippling economic sanctions imposed in 1990
after President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, triggering the Gulf
War.
	   Monday's report noted some areas of improvement, such as the
IAEA's determination that a so-called High Government Committee on
Iraq's nuclear program was of little practical significance.
However, it disputed Baghdad's claims that the late Lt. Gen.
Hussein Kamel al-Majid _ a son-in-law of President Saddam Hussein _
was solely responsible for Iraq's program.
	   ``It is beyond debate that concealment of components of Iraq's
clandestine nuclear program continued until at least August 1995,''
the report said. ``It remains difficult for the IAEA to distinguish
the actions of such a senior government official from that of the
government itself.''
	   The IAEA is expanding its activities into a widespread
monitoring program but such a program ``must be comprehensive and
rigorous and, as a result, is intrusive,'' the report said.
	   It warned against any reduction or interference with inspectors'
rights and called for member states to stand ready to contribute to
the estimated dlrs 9 million it will cost to expand the monitoring
system.

Tourists damage several Nazca lines in Peru

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Tourists in a four-wheel drive vehicle drove
across a section of Peru's enigmatic Nazca Lines, damaging at least
three of the lines etched in the desert sand, authorities said
Monday.
	   The tourists, who were not identified by authorities but drove a
truck with a California license plate, on Thursday bypassed
protective concrete markers and drove across the desert plain,
passing over the lines, said park guardian Hector Garcia.
	   The tourists stayed the night among the lines, leaving food and
garbage behind on the desert, located 250 miles (400 kilometers)
south of Lima.
	   The famous figures of the hummingbird, monkey, heron, whale,
spider and flower were not damaged, said district prosecutor Jose
Herrera Ramos. The tourists were not stopped after damaging other
lines. It was not known if they were still in Peru.
	   The shallow lines were made well over a thousand years ago,
hundreds of years before the Inca empire, by clearing the stony
surface of the plains and exposing the whitish soil underneath.
There are thousands of Nazca lines.
	   They are one of Peru's top tourist attraction and cover a
35-mile (60-km) stretch of desert.
	   Theories proposed as to their purpose range from an ancient
calendar to a map of underground water supplies to alien landing
strips.
	   Archaeologists fear the lines may be at risk of further damage
from such intrusions because of the death in May of their longtime
guardian and investigator, German mathematician Maria Reiche.
	   Reiche, who died of cancer at the age of 95, had protected the
lines tirelessly for more than half a century. She often paid
guards with her own money to keep vehicles off the lines.
	   ``When Maria Reiche was alive we Peruvians knew the Nazca Lines
would be respected. Now this is in doubt,'' said Federico
Kauffmann-Doig, one of Peru's leading archaeologists.
	   Among the threats to the lines Reiche fought was a government
project to ``reconstruct'' the drawings, acid rain from nearby
mining operations and even a plan to flood the plains for
agriculture.
	   Kauffman-Doig said Peru's government allots so little money to
the care of the Nazca lines that it will be almost impossible to
protect the large desert expanse from intruders without someone
like Reiche.
	   Nazca residents hoped the damage will not be permanent.
	   ``We hope that time, wind and blowing sand will cover over the
tire tracks on the lines,'' said Daniel Mantilla, director of Radio
Sport in Nazca.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Almost from the moment he turned 50, Hale
Irwin has ruled the senior tour. He's so good he can win even after
shooting his worst round of the year.
	   ``He is the best senior player out here,'' Raymond Floyd said
after Irwin birdied the 16th and 18th holes Sunday to win the 19th
U.S. Senior Open after carding a 6-over-par 77 in the first round.
``He showed the world that.
	   ``I've never seen a tour dominated the way he has done the last
two years. It's incredible.''
	   Since becoming eligible for the senior tour on June 3, 1995,
Irwin has earned a staggering dlrs 6,761,058 while winning 18 of 72
events _ or one of every four in which he's played.
	   Nobody has ever dominated a golf tour like that.
	   The former defensive back at Colorado is the leading career
money-winner in professional golf history with over dlrs 12.6
million in earnings.
	   Irwin has had an exceptional career on the PGA Tour with 20
tournament victories _ one of 32 players to reach that plateau _
and over dlrs 5.9 million in career earnings.
	   But as a senior, he's been at another level, and his effort over
the rugged par-71 Riviera Country Club course was a perfect
example.
	   Irwin, 53, left Riviera without speaking to reporters Thursday
after his first-round score of 77 _ two shots higher than his
poorest round of the year to that point.
	   Later, he said he didn't think there was anything worth talking
about. He just wanted to forget the day, and round, ever happened.
	   It worked.
	   First, Irwin got back into contention with a 3-under-par 68 in
the second round.
	   Then, he overcame three bogeys on the first five holes of the
third round for an even-par 71, capped off by a chip from off the
green for a birdie on No. 18.
	   Then came Sunday's effort _ a 2-under-par 69 with difficult
birdie putts of about 25 feet on the 16th hole and around 12 feet
on the 18th for a 72-hole score of 285 and a one-shot victory over
Vicente Fernandez of Argentina.
	   Floyd, who led after each of the first three rounds, wound up
third, two shots off the pace.
	   What Irwin has accomplished is total dominance.
	   He won two tournaments and led all seniors in earnings at dlrs
1,615,769 in 1996.
	   Then, he won nine of the 23 senior events he entered last year,
and again was first in earnings at dlrs 2,343,364 _ a single-season
record for all tours.
	   Irwin's Senior Open win was his fifth tournament victory this
year and was worth dlrs 267,500 from a purse of dlrs 1.5 million,
boosting his 1998 earnings to dlrs 2,002,750.

Rightist paramilitary leaders make peace offer in Colombia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JARED KOTLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Right-wing paramilitary groups that for
years have imposed a reign of terror in the Colombian countryside
said Monday they would join nationwide peace talks to end a 34-year
civil war.
	   In a statement, leaders representing the country's main
paramilitary groups also promised to avoid attacks on civilians and
the recruitment of children, and to treat rebel prisoners humanely.
	   A civilian peace commission met Sunday with top militia leaders
in Cordoba province, a paramilitary stronghold in northern
Colombia.
	   President-elect Andres Pastrana, who takes office August 7, has
agreed to peace talks during the first 90 days of his
administration with leftist rebels who have been fighting the
Colombian state since the 1960s.
	   ``We celebrate the peace initiatives of the president elect ...
and we commit ourselves to participate in all the necessary steps
with discretion, seriousness and responsibility,'' said a joint
statement of the paramilitary leaders and the civilian commission.
	   The civilian delegates agreed to ask the government to conduct
peace talks with the paramilitary groups while negotiations with
the rebels take place separately.
	   Human rights groups accuse the paramilitary groups, who are
financed by landowners and drug traffickers and supported by rogue
army elements, of killing civilians they suspect are rebels and
forcing hundreds of thousands of Colombians to flee their homes out
of fear.
	   Both the rebels and the militias have said they will not lay
down arms unless the other side does so first.
	   Colombia's second-largest rebel group, the National Liberation
Army, pledged this month to scale back kidnappings and eventually
cease attacks against foreign-run oil pipelines.
	   Despite the promise, rebels from the smaller Popular Liberation
Army are suspected of kidnapping a ruling party congressman,
Gerardo Tamayo, who stopped at a guerrilla roadblock Monday.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The new Northern Spirit franchise will
become the wealthiest soccer club in Australia and restablish ties
with former national coach Terry Venables, Spirit chairman Remo
Nogarotto said Monday.
	   The Spirit, to be based in North Sydney, announced it has been
taken over by English first division club Crystal Palace through MG
Investments, a company owned by its executive chairman Mark
Goldberg.
	   Now flushed with cash to go with some of Australia's best
players, including former Australian international Robbie Slater,
the Spirit is favored to take out the National League championship
in its debut season.
	   MG Investments has a 70-percent stake in the Spirit following a
series of discussions between Nogarotto and Goldberg over recent
months.
	   Goldberg completed his purchase of Palace, at which Venables is
head coach, early in June for a figure reported to be just short of
US dlrs 38 million. (djp)

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Emanuel Steward told it how it is. At a boxing
news conference, no less.
	   ``He has one of the least impressive records I've seen,''
Steward, the trainer of WBC heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis, said
of the unbeaten No. 1 challenger, Zeljko Mavrovic of Croatia.
``There's no important names on it.''
	   Well, there's Przemyslaw Saleta and Lajos Eros. Or how about
Vincenzo Cantatore.
	   Perhaps U.S. boxing fans would recognize the names of James
Pritchard and Nathaniel Fitch.
	   Steward, however, saved himself from a public relations TKO
Monday by later playing up Mavrovic's 27-0 record, with 22
knockouts, against nondescript opponents.
	   ``But that can be deceiving,'' Steward said. ``He has a burning
desire to beat Lennox Lewis.''
	   Lewis, who said he wants to fight Evander Holyfield and suggests
the WBA-IBF champion is ducking him, will fight Mavrovic on Sept.
26 because it is a mandatory defense. The HBO-televised bout will
be held at the Mohegan Sun Casino at Uncasville, Connecticut.
	   It will only be the 29-year-old Mavrovic's fifth fight in the
United States and first since he stopped Ken Smith in the second
round on June 17, 1995, at Las Vegas. He hasn't fought anywhere
since Oct. 18, 1997.
	   ``I'm motivated, I'm looking forward to it,'' Lewis said of his
match against the European champion. ``He has a great European
style, but for most of my amateur career I fought Europeans.''
	   Lewis, the 1988 Olympic champion who fought for Canada although
he is a native of England, has already made a WBC title defense
against an East European. Lewis (33-1, 27 knockouts) stopped Andrew
Golota of Poland in the first round Nov. 4, 1997.
	   In his last fight, Lewis got out of serious trouble in the first
two rounds and stopped Shannon Briggs in the fifth round April 28
at Atlantic City, New Jersey.
	   Mavrovic spoke to the news conference by telephone from Croatia,
where he is training.
	   The first thing Mavrovic, who speaks English, did was pronounce
his name, which sounded like ``Zzz-jelko Mavrovich.''
	   ``It is very hard to say in English,'' he said, ``But my
nickname is Zed if you want to say something short.''
	   Lewis tried out the short name immediately.
	   ``Zed has never seen anybody like me,'' he said.

Top international official says indicted criminals losing
</HEADLINE>
authority &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The top international official in Bosnia
said Monday that former Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic has
been losing his influence over Serbs and suggested he could finally
be tried for war crimes.
	   Carlos Westendorp disputed a report Saturday in The New York
Times that the United States had dropped plans for a raid to arrest
Karadzic and his former military chief Gen. Ratko Mladic because of
fears of a blood bath and reluctance on the part of French
officers.
	   In the seven months since Serbs elected a new leadership and
their economic situation brightened, Karadzic has become more and
more marginalized and can no longer rely on the protection he has
had in the past, Westendorp said.
	   ``So everything points at the need and the possibility and the
feasibility that he goes to the Hague either voluntarily or by
persuasion,'' he said.
	   He spoke to reporters after briefing the Security Council on the
situation in Bosnia, which he said was improving. He welcomed the
recent creation of a new Croat political party and held out hope
that elections in September would continue to improve the political
climate in Bosnia.
	   Problem areas still include the return of refugees to their
pre-war homes, with only 11,000 out of a target 50,000 refugees
returned, he said. Over the coming months, more work also must be
done to reform the judicial system so that judges aren't appointed
by political parties, and to modify electoral laws to allow for a
more multiethnic country, he said.
	   But he said full reconciliation in Bosnia could only begin once
Karadzic and Mladic, who are indicted for genocide and war crimes,
are on trial at the international tribunal in the Hague,
Netherlands.
	   Karadzic is no longer the war hero he once was and can no longer
rely on smuggling channels to pay for the protection that helped
him evade arrest, he said.
	   ``It is precisely because after seven months of a new
government, the population has seen that their economic situation
and their democratic rights have improved dramatically,''
Westendorp said. ``The people are no longer intimidated by the
police and by the authorities, except in some areas which are still
under control of the hard-liners.''
	   He said the economic growth rate in the Serbian entity in Bosnia
is expected to be 35 percent of the GNP ``which means that the
people are starting to think they were kidnapped from welfare and
from democracy, and one of the main reasons was the presence of
Radovan Karadzic in the country.''

Iraq nuclear report says intrusive, long-term monitoring necessary
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details from report, no evidence of sustained program
found, no way to refute foreign involvement, minor edits. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. inspectors have found no evidence
that Iraq is trying to maintain its nuclear program and suggested
in a report Monday that a rigorous and intrusive monitoring program
continue to try to verify that no such program exists.
	   Though noting some clarifications, the report said Iraq
continues to conceal information about its nuclear abilities and
hasn't given inspectors proof to back up claims that it abandoned
its nuclear program in 1991.
	   The International Atomic Energy Agency report was scheduled to
be considered Wednesday by the Security Council, where Russia has
sought to end inspections in favor of less intrusive ``passive
monitoring'' of known Iraqi research facilities.
	   In May, faced with U.S. objection to the Russian proposal, the
Security Council agreed to put off any decision on a scaleback
until Iraq made ``substantive clarifications'' about its nuclear
weapons program.
	   The council asked the IAEA to report back to them by July.
	   Monday's report, however, appeared to shed little new light on
Iraq's program. Council sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said it was unlikely the council would take any action
on the report and would instead wait for the regular October
review.
	   It was unclear if the United States would acknowledge that the
IAEA had done all it could do with inspections, which some council
diplomats have suggested.
	   Baghdad must destroy all weapons of mass destruction before the
council will lift crippling economic sanctions imposed in 1990
after President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, triggering the Gulf
War.
	   Monday's report noted some areas of improvement, such as the
IAEA's determination that a so-called High Government Committee on
Iraq's nuclear program was of little practical significance.
However, it disputed Baghdad's claims that the late Lt. Gen.
Hussein Kamel al-Majid _ a son-in-law of President Saddam Hussein _
was solely responsible for Iraq's program.
	   ``It is beyond debate that concealment of components of Iraq's
clandestine nuclear program continued until at least August 1995,''
the report said. ``It remains difficult for the IAEA to distinguish
the actions of such a senior government official from that of the
government itself.''
	   The IAEA is expanding its activities into a widespread
monitoring program but such a program ``must be comprehensive and
rigorous and, as a result, is intrusive,'' the report said.
	   The report repeated previous assertions that it found no
indications that Iraq retained the ability to produce weapon-usable
nuclear material. Iraq never achieved its goal of producing weapons
but ``it is clear that Iraq had made significant progress in
weaponization technologies before April 1991,'' when it claimed to
have dismantled its program.
	   The report said inspectors couldn't confirm or refute whether
Iraq took advantage of offers from abroad to assist in developing
its program.

Government says it will reform immigration policy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with reaction from refugee groups; no PICKUP

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The government said Monday it will modernize and
streamline Britain's immigration procedures to stamp out ``blatant
and often cynical abuse'' by asylum seekers and offer a quicker
service.
	   Home Secretary Jack Straw told the House of Commons he wanted to
make the immigration service ``fairer, faster and firmer,'' and
said the current system was a ``shambles.''
	   Among proposals listed in a white paper unveiled by Straw Monday
were establishing a single right of appeal for asylum seekers,
introducing a statutory scheme to regulate unscrupulous immigration
advisers and ensuring asylum seekers who are refused permission to
stay in Britain are returned quickly to their country of origin.
	   Straw said that the current immigration system was under
pressure due to growing numbers of economic refugees, and was
vulnerable to unscrupulous immigrants.
	   The number of asylum seekers has increased eightfold in the past
decade, from 4,000 to 34,000 last year, costing the taxpayer 500
million pounds (dlrs 800 million) a year, and although three
quarters of asylum applications are refused outright, Straw said,
the lengthy appeals process means many cases drag on for years.
	   ``Huge backlogs have developed. Perversely, it is the genuine
applicant who has suffered while abusive claimants and racketeers
have profited,'' Straw said.
	   To cut through bureaucracy, Straw said about 10,000 asylum
seekers who have been waiting since 1993 for their cases to be
heard, and a further 20,000 waiting since 1995, are likely to be
told they can stay in Britain, although Straw said he was not
declaring an amnesty for the total backlog of 52,000 cases.
	   Amnesty International said it had ``grave concerns'' that the
reforms would not protect refugees.
	   Refugee Officer Jan Shaw said plans for immigration liaison
officers at foreign ports and airports would make it harder for
those fleeing persecution to escape their home countries if they
were unable to seek visas or passports from their own governments.
	   And she criticized the proposal for making only ``cursory
reference'' to the need to improve initial decision-making
procedures.
	   Nick Hardwick, chief executive of the Refugee Council, warned
the support arrangement risked being ``costly, cumbersome and
chaotic,'' saying asylum seekers should be allowed to work or at
least receive cash payments.
	   Claude Moraes of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants
said the paper had some positive aspects, but without tackling the
inherent ``culture of disbelief'' prevalent among immigration
officers, would not help sift genuine from bogus applicants.

Woman who was cavity-searched wins dlrs 70,000 in damages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTOWN, Jamaica (AP) _ A Kingston woman who was given a
cavity search under orders from customs agents was awarded drls
70,000 (Jamaican dlrs 2.5 million) in damages by a Jamaican court.
	   A jury ruled customs agents at Kingston's Norman Manley
International Airport broke the law by having a male doctor search
Celma Pinnock's vagina instead of a female doctor.
	   They agents had received a tip that Pinnock might be carrying
drugs, but they found nothing.
	   Pinnock claimed the search triggered depression, a fear of
travel and a loss of interest in sex.
	   She had sued the government for dlrs 140,000 (Jamaican dlrs 5
million), but the jury decided the customs agents had not acted
with malice and awarded the lower amount.

Margas reaches deal with West Ham United
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Javier Margas, the full back of the
Chilean national soccer squad in the recent soccer World Cup, on
Monday said he has reached an agreement for a four-year contract
with the West Ham United side of the English Premier league.
	   Margas, who dyed his hair red when Chile made it to the second
round in the World Cup, said he will fly to London on Tuesday to
sign a contract.
	   He refused to disclose the money involved in the operation, but
local papers had reported the transfer would bring in 3 million
dollars to Margas' current club, Universidad Catolica.
	   The 29-year-old Margas had previously played for Colo Colo of
Chile and America of Mexico, and has been a starter in the national
squad for almost a decade.

Beckman plays first game since World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ David Beckham played his first game since
the World Cup when Manchester United tied Norwegian Valerenga 2-2
in a friendly Monday.
	   If English soccer fans have not forgiven Beckham for his
mistake, the Norwegian United fans certainly have. Norway's biggest
newspaper, VG, encouraged all the fans to bring poster saying
``Welcome Beckham,'' and many fans had brought the posters to give
Beckham their support.
	   Many Norwegians think the English press went too far in
harassing Beckham, and quite a few fans had Beckham jerseys.
	   ``Everyone is mad at Beckham , but that is not fair. Those who
think Beckham had all guilt can go home,'' Marius Nilsen, 12, said.
United had many young supporters at Bislett stadium.
	   When United arrived Norway Sunday, Beckham received flowers and
a teddy bear from fans, but he is still silent. All United players
headed straight for the showers when excited fans invaded the field
after the game.
	   John Carew of Valerenga opened the game with a goal in the 7th
minute. But United came back. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer made a shot in
the 11th, and Paul Scholes took advantage of the rebound. Solskjaer
scored the 2-1 goal two minutes later, and Bjorn Viljugrein made it
2-2 in the 46th.

Chinese gymnast starts rehabilitation

	   EAST MEADOW, New York (AP) _ A Chinese gymnast paralyzed in a
Goodwill Games' practice started her long road to rehabilitation
Monday, amid cards and gifts from as far away as Hong Kong and
Venezuela.
	   Doctors said 17-year-old Sang Lan was showing modest signs of
recovery after falling on her head during a warmup for the women's
vault last Tuesday.
	   Although one of her toes moved during an examination by a
neurologist, doctors considered the movement an involuntary reflex,
Nassau County Medical Center spokeswoman Shelley Lotenberg said.
	   It was the first movement in Sang's lower body since spinal
surgery Saturday, Lotenberg added.
	   ``Anything is encouraging,'' the spokeswoman said. ``She's
stable and has started her rehabilitation. But it's a long
process.''
	   Lotenberg said Sang has been cheered by all the messages of good
will she has received.
	   ``She was watching the `Lion King' and tapes from the Goodwill
Games, and she's very encouraged by all the messages and cards and
teddy bears people have sent to encourage her to be strong. The
messages are in all languages and have arrived from Hong Kong,
Venezuela and other countries,'' Lotenberg said.
	   The medical center's Dr. Vincent Leone said Sang was showing
hopeful but modest signs of progress.
	   ``She has much stronger shoulder and elbow functions. ... Her
sensory level has improved,'' he said, quickly adding that he was
``cautiously optimistic but it is unlikely that she will walk
again.''
	   ``There are just so many different nerve connections that have
to heal,'' he has said.
	   A seven-hour operation inserted steel rods to stabilize Sang's
neck and removed bone fragments from her spinal cord.
	   Sang was able to sit up Sunday and was visited by her parents
and members of the Chinese gymnastics team.

Judge orders priest continued held in bishop's slaying

6th graf pvs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A priest arrested in the murder of a
prominent bishop was ordered held in prison on Monday while
prosecutors mount evidence against him.
	   Investigating Judge Isaias Figueroa Medina issued the order
against Mario Orantes, whose arrest last week shocked the country.
He is accused of killing Bishop Juan Gerardi, though a gag order on
those involved in the case has left the alleged motive a mystery.
	   Also ordered held was Margarita Lopez, a church cook accused of
covering up the slaying.
	   Orantes, 39, reported finding the bishop's bludgeoned corpse on
April 26 at the San Sebastian church, where both lived.
	   Suspicion for the crime had fallen on right-wing death squads
because the killing came two days after Gerardi, head of a church
human rights office, had issued a major report blaming the military
and associated groups for most of the killings in Guatemala's civil
war of 1960-1996.
	   The Archdiocese of Guatemala City said in a Monday press
statement that the church does not oppose the investigations but
``believes in the innocence of Father Mario Orantes Najera.''
	   ``We demand, out of respect for Monsignor Gerardi ... the Church
and the people of Guatemala, that no more distractions be
elaborated to hide the real killers,'' the statement continued.
	   Figueroa's order, 6th grave pvs

Two die in seaplane accident off during VIP tour
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHAMPTON, England (AP) _ Two people, including the mayor of
Southampton, were killed Monday when a seaplane they were flying in
crash landed off the south coast of England during a VIP tour.
	   The 1946 Catalina was on a flight organized by the city council
to promote an upcoming air show when it tipped over after it tried
to land on the water about half a mile 0.5 (0.8 kilometers) from
the coast of Southampton. The twin-engine seaplane, which was
carrying 18 people, sank in about 20 feet (6 meters) of water.
	   The Coastguard and local boats passing by rescued most of the
passengers, but divers found two bodies in the sunken plane.
	   Michael Andrews, mayor of Southampton, died at the hospital and
another passenger, Peter Shave, was pronounced dead on arrival.
	   Ten other passengers were taken to the hospital for treatment of
shock and hypothermia.
	   Police said they did not know what caused the crash.

Brazilian confederation dismisses entire national team coaching
</HEADLINE>
staff &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ The Brazilian Soccer Confederation
on Monday dismissed national team coach Mario Zagallo and the
entire staff that coached the team during the World Cup in France.
	   ``The saga will continue, and you'll have the last installment
when they name the new coach,'' Zagallo told reporters.
	   The move was widely expected, and the team's new coach will be
named Aug. 31.
	   Zagallo coached the national team over 148 games in two terms,
including 107 victories, 29 ties and 12 losses.
	   Zagallo's first game as coach came in 1970 when Brazil beat
Chile 5-0 in the World Cup in Mexico. He led Brazil to the World
Cup title that year and took over again following the 1994
tournament. His last game was this year's World Cup final, which
Brazil lost 3-0 to France.

Reports: Sumitomo Bank, Daiwa Securities to form investment bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In the latest aftershock from Japan's financial
system reforms, Sumitomo Bank Ltd. and Daiwa Securities Co. have
agreed to form a Western-style investment bank, media reported
Tuesday.
	   The two companies will spin off their capital market and
corporate-client divisions, combining them in an investment-bank
offering sophisticated financial services to corporate customers,
the Nihon Keizai business daily reported.
	   The new company will provide securities underwriting, trading,
mergers and acquisitions services and derivative transactions, the
daily reported.
	   Quoting sources at the two companies, the reports said the
venture would be announced later Tuesday.
	   Sumitomo and Daiwa are also reportedly studying a possible
consolidation of overseas securities units, while Sumitomo is
considering merging its securities subsidiary, Sumitomo Capital
Securities Co., into the new company, the paper said.
	   The two are also seeking to form a tie-up with an overseas
institution, the paper said.
	   Sources at the two financial giants said the new venture is
expected to start operating in April of next year with
capitalization of 300 billion yen (dlrs 2.1 billion), Kyodo News
service reported.
	   Daiwa will have a 60 percent stake while Sumitomo will take the
remaining 40 percent, Kyodo said, quoting the sources.
	   The reported move is the latest in a continuing consolidation in
Japan's financial industry.
	   Banks and other financial institutions are scrambling to form
new alliances with both domestic and overseas companies in line
with major reforms _ known collectively as the ``big bang'' _ aimed
at increasing competition in Japan's financial industry.
	   Last month, Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. announced that it will
form Japan's largest asset management company early next year
	   Foreign financial companies are also moving rapidly to take
advantage of the sweeping deregulation. U.S. securities company
Merrill Lynch and Co. is expanding its brokerage business here
after hiring some 2,000 employees of failed Yamaichi Securities
Co., Japan's fourth-largest brokerage.
	   Yamaichi folded late last year after revealing more than 250
billion yen (dlrs 1.8 billion) in hidden losses.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON _ In a day of dramatic advances for prosecutor
Kenneth Starr, former White House intern Monica Lewinsky ended six
months of silence and talked with prosecutors investigating whether
she had an affair with President Bill Clinton and participated in a
cover-up, several sources said. Monday's development, which
startled beleaguered Clinton supporters, could signal the coming of
an immunity deal that would pit the 25-year-old former intern
against the president of the United States. The sources said no
decision had been made on whether to offer Ms. Lewinsky immunity.
Dealing a second setback to Clinton, a federal appeals court
ordered the president's closest confidant to submit to questioning
by the Lewinsky grand jury. The court said attorney-client
privilege did not pertain to Clinton's conversations with Bruce
Lindsey about how to deal with the Lewinsky controversy.
(US-CLINTON-INVESTIGATION)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Cambodian elections officials have
postponed the release of preliminary results from parliamentary
elections, prompting allegations of fraud from a challenger to
strongman Hun Sen. ``We are moving into a very dangerous game. They
want to buy time, they want to arrange the result of the
election,'' Sam Rainsy, a popular former finance minister and
leading opposition figure, said Monday. But the group coordinating
678 international observers monitoring the elections said after
hours of deliberations that it believed the delays were purely
technical and that the voting process was free and fair.
(CAMBODIA-ELECTIONS)
	   UNITED NATIONS _ U.N. inspectors have found no evidence that
Iraq is trying to maintain its nuclear program and suggested in a
report that a rigorous and intrusive monitoring program try to
verify that no such program exists. Though noting some
clarifications, the report said Monday that Iraq continues to
conceal information about its nuclear abilities and hasn't given
inspectors proof to back up claims that it abandoned its nuclear
program in 1991. The International Atomic Energy Agency report was
scheduled to be considered Wednesday by the Security Council, where
Russia has sought to end inspections in favor of less intrusive
``passive monitoring'' of known Iraqi research facilities.
(UN-IRAQ)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Serb police and Yugoslav army troops
surrounded a major ethnic Albanian stronghold in western Kosovo
province, jammed with thousands of Albanian refugees. The move came
on the fourth day of a major Serb offensive aimed at driving the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army from key transportation and
communication arteries in the province in southern Serbia. Both
sides reported casualties. Government forces who reached the town
of Junik on Monday gave civilians and members of the KLA an hour to
leave by one of two corridors _ one for civilians that led to
police and the other for guerrillas leading to army positions.
Reporters at the scene Monday said the deadline passed with no one
leaving the village, 80 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of
Pristina. Serb and Albanian forces began exchanging mortar fire as
the reporters left the area near sunset. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   RUHENGERI, Rwanda _ An estimated 15,000 Hutus have started
emerging from forests in northwestern Rwanda where the were forced
to flee more than a year ago, civilian and army officials said.
Hutu rebels, who are fighting against what they believe to be the
Tutsi occupation of Rwanda, have forced the civilians to take to
the forests with them to provide cover, food and money. Several of
them said they had seized the opportunity when they saw the Hutu
rebels in disarray after government soldiers last week killed two
rebel leaders, said Emmanuel Uwihanhanye, the mayor of Nyamutera
commune near the northwestern town of Ruhengeri, said Monday.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Blue-chip shares rose sharply Monday after
shaking off an early slide, but most stocks finished lower amid
continuing worries about last week's rash of profit warnings. On
Wall Stret, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 90.88 points to
9,028.24 after erasing an early 81-point drop that put the measure
almost 500 points below July 17's record of 9,337.97. The Dow lost
slightly more than 400 points last week, a slide that was barely
interrupted by Friday's 4-point gain. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The dollar rose against the Japanese yen and
German mark Monday as traders worried that Japan's new leader won't
be aggressive enough to turn around the country's moribund economy.
The U.S. currency advanced after the Tokyo Stock Exchange's main
index dropped to its lowest level in nearly a month. Investors
feared that outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's likely
replacement, Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, won't push through
tough economic reforms. In late New York trading, the dollar was
quoted at 142.41 yen, up from 141.44 late Friday. The U.S. currency
also was changing hands at 1.7870 marks, up from 1.7820.
(US-DOLLAR)
	   TORONTO (AP) _ For the first time in its 140-year history, the
Canadian dollar's value fell Monday to less than two-thirds of the
U.S. dollar, fueling debate over the federal strategy of passively
riding out the plunge. The Canadian dollar closed in Toronto at
66.51 U.S. cents, down from 66.71 cents Friday. One U.S. dollar was
valued at dlrs 1.5035 in Canadian currency. Known as the loonie
because of a loon pictured on the dlrs 1 coin, the Canadian dollar
has been weak for months because of the Asian financial crisis. It
has set record lows almost daily for the past two weeks.
(CANADA-LOWLY LOONIE)
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ In another sign of consolidation in
the global auto industry, Daimler-Benz AG and Nissan Diesel Motor
Co. of Japan said Monday they would jointly build a light truck
starting in 2002 as a first step toward a broader alliance. Nissan
Motor, Japan's second-largest automaker, and Daimler, Germany's
largest industrial group, said in May they were in talks on a
possible alliance or joint venture. Daimler, which has been looking
to strengthen its global position, has said it wants to double its
market share in Asia within the next 10 years to at least 20
percent. It already is buying Chrysler to expand its presence in
the U.S. market. (GERMANY-DAIMLER NISSAN)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Bell Atlantic Corp. and GTE Corp. are discussing
a merger that would be worth as much as dlrs 55 billion, according
to published reports Monday. In what would be latest in a series of
high-value mergers, Bell Atlantic and GTE would form a company with
62 million local telephone lines, The Wall Street Journal reported.
The move would also spring Bell Atlantic into desired long-distance
markets. GTE's dominance in local and long-distance services and
Bell Atlantic's virtual monopoly in the Northeast region could
create a giant that has one-third of the United States' local
telephone lines in 40 states and that would dwarf the pending
combination of SBC Communications Inc. and Ameritech Corp, the
Journal said. (US-GTE-BELL ATLANTIC)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian stocks plummeted 9.1 percent Monday, the
sixth straight day of losses as investors expressed doubts about
the government's ability to settle its differences with Communists
in parliament. The stock market got a brief boost earlier this
month when the International Monetary Fund and other lenders agreed
on a dlrs 17 billion bailout package to guide Russia through it
current financial crisis. But the Communists in parliament have
resisted President Boris Yeltsin's financial stabilization plan,
which includes numerous tax-raising measures. The standoff has
again undermined confidence among both Russian and foreign
investors. The Russian market, which was the world's top performer
for the past two years, is down more than 60 percent in 1998.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Comparing East Asia's financial
crisis with the devastations of war, China and Thailand warned
Monday that new problems could emerge to threaten regional
stability. Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, addressing a
security forum arranged by the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, stressed that economic growth is the ``material basis''
for regional _ and global _ security. East Asia's financial crisis,
he told the ASEAN Regional Forum, ``fully indicates that economic
security has increasingly become an inseparable part of national
and regional security.'' The crisis ``broke out ferociously ... no
less than that of a war,'' he said. (ASIA-ECONOMIC CRISIS)

	   PORTLAND, Oregon (AP) _ King Simeon II and Queen Margarita,
exiled royalty from Bulgaria, visited over the weekend with
American families who have taken in orphans from Bulgaria, Romania,
China and Honduras.
	   The families adopted children through All God's Children
International, a Portland-based non-profit adoption and relief
service.
	   ``To see all these kids and the families they've found is
wonderful,'' said King Simeon, who was exiled when he was 9 years
old. ``I had no idea that this process had expanded so much and
that so many parents are willing to adopt Bulgarian children.''
	   The king and queen spent two days meeting families with children
placed by the service. About 200 people were on hand Sunday for the
agency's 7th annual picnic at Washington Park.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   TOKYO (AP) _ ``Theme Park'' might as well be Michael Jackson's
middle name.
	   Jackson told reporters Monday he'll team up with a Japanese
company to build three sprawling theme parks, complete with golf
courses and hotels, and create a new chain of toy stores in Japan
and elsewhere.
	   ``This is going to be one of a kind,'' he said.
	   The joint venture _ Michael Jackson Japan Co. Ltd. _ is still in
the process of selecting locations for the parks, two of which will
be built in Japan. Prosperity Enterprise Corp. is Jackson's
Japanese partner.
	   The company also plans to open ``Wonder World of Toys'' stores,
with the first store expected to open in Japan, followed by a
second one in Guam by March 1999.
	   ``Michael himself will choose the toys,'' said Kanji Ishizumi,
legal adviser to the company.
	   Jackson wants to build similar theme parks in Poland and Brazil.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Michael ``Lord of the Dance'' Flatley hung up his
dancing shoes and said he may put on boxing gloves next.
	   Flatley's appearance before 25,000 fans in Hyde Park on Saturday
was his last as the lead Irish dancer in the group.
	   ``Boxing is a possibility and I have been offered a lot of
money,'' Flatley said before the show.
	   Flatley, 40, mastered the footwork of a boxer growing up in
Chicago before he took up the dance.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Elizabeth Scarlett Jagger, all of 14 years old, is
following mom on the catwalks.
	   The daughter of Mick Jagger and ex-model Jerry Hall made her
runway debut last week during the Paris shows and appears to have
inherited mom's long legs.
	   ``She said she doesn't want to walk like me,'' said Hall, who
appeared with Elizabeth at the show of Thierry Mugler.
	   Elizabeth's half sister, Jade Jagger, also modeled, and The
Donald's daughter Ivanka Trump is in the business now too.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ANAHEIM, California (AP) _ Jim Bakker is back in the pulpit
again.
	   ``It's awesome to die and come back,'' he told about 400
worshippers at Way of Life Church, where he was the guest speaker
Sunday.
	   The former PTL Ministries leader presided over a multimillion
dollar TV ministry until he resigned amid a sex and money scandal
that led to a five-year prison term.
	   The reinvigorated Bakker preached against ``the gospel of
money.''
	   ``If you fall in love with the things of this world, you will be
disappointed,'' he said. He apologized for his misdeeds and once
lavish lifestyle and thanked the Lord for sending him to prison.
	   Bakker has moved to Los Angeles and joined the International
Dream Center helping inner-city youth.
	   ``My flesh doesn't want to live in the inner city because I
don't like earthquakes,'' Bakker said. ``Jesus told me to move to
L.A.''

	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A priest arrested in the murder of a
prominent bishop was ordered held in prison on Monday while
prosecutors collect evidence against him.
	   Investigating Judge Isaias Figueroa Medina issued the order
against Mario Orantes, whose arrest last week shocked the country.
He is accused of killing Bishop Juan Gerardi, though a gag order on
those involved in the case has left the alleged motive a mystery.
	   Also ordered held was Margarita Lopez, a church cook accused of
covering up the slaying.
	   Orantes, 39, reported finding the bishop's bludgeoned corpse on
April 26 at the San Sebastian church, where both lived.
	   Suspicion for the crime had fallen on right-wing death squads
because the killing came two days after Gerardi, head of a church
human rights office, had issued a major report blaming the military
and associated groups for most of the killings in Guatemala's civil
war of 1960-1996.
	   The Archdiocese of Guatemala City said in a Monday press
statement that the church does not oppose the investigations but
``believes in the innocence of Father Mario Orantes Najera.''
	   Figueroa's order gives prosecutors as much as three months to
provide evidence to determine whether Orantes should be formally
tried.
	   Also being held in the case is a civilian named Carlos Enrique
Vielman, who was arrested April 30.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ A former minister in President Alberto
Fujimori's Cabinet who faces tax evasion charges has asked
Venezuela for asylum, charging government officials with political
harassment.
	   Guido Pennano, who was Industry Minister for several months in
1990 at the start of Fujimori's government, took refuge in the
Venezuelan embassy Sunday night, two days after being released on
bail for tax evasion charges. He had spent 12 days in prison.
	   Following his release, a Lima court quickly issued another
arrest order and he fled to the embassy.
	   The government has charged that two of Pennano's companies
failed to pay dlrs 400,000 in taxes in 1996 and 1997.
	   Pennano, who remained in the embassy Monday, has denied that he
failed to pay taxes and said the charges were a reprisal against
him for his criticism of government officials following his
resignation as minister.
	   He left Fujimori's government in 1990 due to differences over
economic policy and criticized top officials repeatedly in a
television show he hosted.
	   The Venezuelan government has not said if it will grant him
asylum.
	   ___
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ In a last-ditch attempt
to secure a chance at a second term, Dominican President Leonel
Fernandez called a special legislative session Monday to debate
constitutional changes.
	   Fernandez wants to eliminate a one-term constitutional limit on
the presidency. Since his election in 1996, opposition parties have
thwarted his free-market economic policies, and the 45-year-old
centrist president desperately wants a second chance.
	   The special session begins Tuesday and must end before Aug. 16,
when a newly elected Congress dominated by the rival Dominican
Revolutionary Party takes office.
	   The one-term limit was adopted in 1994 partly in response to
Joaquin Balaguer's 22 years as president.
	   Even leaders of Fernandez's party say it is unlikely they can
muster the needed votes. A similar motion was defeated Saturday,
and on Sunday Jose Tomas Perez, the Liberation Party's publicity
director, said constitutional change was impossible and that party
leaders had to ``face reality.''
	   ___
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Right-wing paramilitary groups that for
years have imposed a reign of terror in the Colombian countryside
announced Monday they would join nationwide peace talks to end a
34-year civil war.
	   In a press statement, leaders representing the country's main
paramilitary groups also promised to avoid attacks on civilians and
the recruitment of minors, and to treat rebel prisoners humanely.
	   President-elect Andres Pastrana, who takes office August 7, has
agreed to peace talks during the first 90 days of his
administration with leftist rebels who have been fighting the
Colombian state since the 1960's.
	   The civilian delegates agreed to ask the government to conduct
peace talks with the paramilitary groups while negotiations with
the guerrillas take place separately.
	   Human rights groups accuse the paramilitary groups, who are
financed by landowners and drug traffickers and supported by rogue
army elements, of killing civilians they suspect are rebels and
forcing hundreds of thousands of Colombians to flee their homes out
of fear.
	   Both the rebels and the militias have said they will not lay
down arms unless the other side does so first.

Cambodian election results postponed until Tuesday

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A group of international observers
who monitored this week's Cambodian parliamentary elections have
declared the process free and fair despite a delay in the release
of preliminary results.
	   The Joint International Observers Group issued a declaration
saying ``all parties should accept and honor the results of the
election without any attempt to undermine the original outcome.''
	   The delay in results, however, prompted allegations of fraud
from a challenger to strongman Hun Sen.
	   ``We are moving into a very dangerous game. They want to buy
time, they want to arrange the result of the election,'' said Sam
Rainsy, a popular former finance minister and leading opposition
figure.
	   But the group coordinating 678 international observers
monitoring the elections said after hours of deliberations Monday
that it believed the delays were purely technical.
	   More than 90 minutes after the results from Sunday's vote were
to be announced, election officials told party activists,
journalists and human rights workers in a packed meeting room that
incomplete documents and communications problems had forced a delay
until Tuesday morning.
	   ``These results are not clear enough to be released,'' said
Samraing Kimsain, spokesman for the National Election Committee,
which is dominated by Hun Sen supporters. ``We want to wait for
more clear information and hope to release the results tomorrow,
step by step.''
	   The endorsement by the Joint International Observers Group was a
major boost for Hun Sen, who called the election to regain the
international legitimacy and aid Cambodia lost after he deposed his
co-premier, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a coup last year.
	   But if a victory by Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party is not
accepted by the opposition or the millions who waited in line to
cast ballots, the outcome could be more turmoil for a nation that
has suffered 30 years of civil war and the Khmer Rouge genocide of
the late 1970s.
	   The three major parties each claimed sweeping victories
throughout the day as members reported results from various
locations, but the violence-marred election campaign and Hun Sen's
steps to pack key posts with his backers had long raised
expectations that the final figures would show victory for his
party.
	   ``I think I have to wait for the results, but the delay makes me
nervous,'' said Lu Laysreng, a candidate for Ranariddh's opposition
party.
	   With no party likely to garner two-thirds of the seats necessary
to control the legislature, a period of uncertainty was likely to
follow the balloting as Hun Sen and his two bitter rivals tried to
put together a coalition government.
	   At least 90 percent of the 5.4 million registered voters cast
ballots Sunday, showing faith in the democratic process.
	   But U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warned that
process could still unravel.
	   ``The real test of Cambodia's democracy will come after the
ballots are counted,'' she said in Manila, Philippines, where she
was attending a meeting of top regional officials.
	   When the United Nations sponsored Cambodian elections in 1993
backed by 20,000 peacekeepers, Ranariddh's party finished atop the
vote. The Cambodian People's Party, which had ruled a single-party
state under the harsh Vietnamese military occupation that followed
the Khmer Rouge regime, was surprised to finish second.
	   Hun Sen refused to accept the result and threatened civil war,
forcing his way into a co-premiership. The tense arrangement was
shattered last year when he sent tanks into the streets to depose
Ranariddh.
	   During the election campaign, the opposition was denied access
to the media, party workers were killed, beaten and threatened, and
voters were intimidated.
	   Election day was not free of violence, either. An attack on a
military outpost by die-hard remnants of the Khmer Rouge left 10
people dead.

Serb forces encircle Albanian stronghold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police and Yugoslav army troops
have surrounded a major ethnic Albanian stronghold in western
Kosovo province, jammed with thousands of Albanian refugees.
	   The move was the latest in a major Serb offensive aimed at
driving the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army from key transportation
and communication arteries in the province in southern Serbia. Both
sides reported casualties.
	   Government forces who reached the town of Junik Monday gave
civilians and members of the KLA an hour to leave by one of two
corridors _ one for civilians that led to police and the other for
guerrillas leading to army positions.
	   Reporters at the scene Monday said the deadline passed with no
one leaving the village, 80 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of
Pristina. Serb and Albanian forces began exchanging mortar fire as
the reporters left the area near sunset.
	   Before leaving, reporters saw eight bodies lying near a small
stream. Police said they were shot early Monday trying to cross
into Albanian from Kosovo.
	   According to the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center, at
least five KLA members have been killed in the latest Serb
offensive, which they launched Friday. The Yugoslav Army said in a
statement that three of its soldiers have been killed since
Saturday and five were injured.
	   The Serbs moved along two strategic highways: the one from
Pristina to Pec, another south to the town of Prizren and a third
near Junik along the Albanian border in western Kosovo in an
apparent attempt to split the area under rebel control. The KLA
holds roughly one-third of the province.
	   Albanian analysts also believed that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic wanted to deliver a blow to the rebels before agreeing to
future talks with moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova on the
fate of the province.
	   While the rebels admitted they suffered losses, they showed no
signs of giving in.
	   ``It's true that we have had losses during the clashes,'' Jakup
Krasniqi, a KLA spokesman told Albanian television late Monday.
``But the enemy has also had many losses _ both in people and
materials _ though they try to minimize them.''
	   So far, the rebel organization has refused to endorse Rugova's
leadership because he opposes violence to gain independence for
Kosovo, whose population of 2 million people is 90 percent ethnic
Albanian.
	   As fighting escalated, special U.S. envoy Christopher Hill
returned Monday to Pristina to continue efforts to cobble together
an Albanian delegation for talks with Milosevic.
	   Hill, the American ambassador to neighboring Macedonia, said the
new fighting ``simply increases the urgency of a political
solution.''
	   ``The more people who are killed, the more embittered certain
people are, the more reluctant they are to agree to any negotiation
that at the end of the day has to involve a certain amount of trust
and good will,'' Hill told The Associated Press.
	   ``And trust and good will kind of go out the window when your
house has burned down and your family's been shot,'' he added.
	   Rugova's party, the Democratic League of Kosovo, echoed that
sentiment, saying the Serb offensive ``has deepened the crisis of
war in Kosovo and will prevent a solution through dialogue.''
	   Milosevic has offered to restore Kosovo's autonomy, which he
abolished in 1989, but he opposes independence for the Serbian
province.
	   The Americans and Europeans also oppose independence, fearing it
will lead to greater demands by the ethnic Albanians to unite with
Albanian communities in other Balkan countries and destabilize the
entire region.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Doling out college scholarships,
medical care and diplomatic flattery, the long-shunned communist
black sheep of the Caribbean is winning a welcome back into the
fold.
	   Cuba is busily establishing trade and diplomatic ties with its
neighbors, mirroring a wider international erosion of support for
U.S. efforts to isolate Fidel Castro's government.
	   Many Caribbean leaders say that despite continuing disagreements
on human rights issues, Cuba could soon join a regional trading
bloc, the Caribbean Community.
	   Illustrating the changed climate, Castro begins a six-day swing
through the Caribbean on Wednesday with a visit to Jamaica,
followed by stops in Barbados and Grenada. He has scheduled a
late-August visit to the Dominican Republic, which restored
diplomatic relations with Cuba this year after a 37-year break.
	   It's a marriage of increasing convenience.
	   Cuba, the Caribbean's biggest country, has cultivated wider
international trade and diplomatic ties since the demise of its
Cold War benefactor, the Soviet Union.
	   Its neighbors, meanwhile, are looking for more diplomatic muscle
for the region. Feeling slighted by U.S. aid cuts and threatened by
global free trade, they hope Cuba can bolster their hand when the
time comes to bargain trade and aid with Europe and Washington.
	   ``Cuba, because of (its) long-standing dispute with the United
States, has a special place in the world. Therefore any
relationship with Cuba brings instant international recognition,''
said Prime Minister Keith Mitchell of Grenada, who has led the
regional drive to accommodate Cuba.
	   At the summit of the 16-member Caribbean Community in early
July, Mitchell said he hoped Cuba would soon join the trade bloc.
The move would increase the group's combined economy from dlrs 30
billion to dlrs 40 billion.
	   Caribbean leaders say they've been emboldened by what they say
is Washington's neglect of the region since the Cold War ended.
	   U.S. aid to the Caribbean dropped 25 percent in five years, from
dlrs 183 million in 1993 to dlrs 137 million last year. Aid in 1998
is expected to drop a further dlrs 3 million.
	   Washington also imperiled the region's vital banana industry
when it persuaded the World Trade Organization to rule that
European preferences for Caribbean bananas violated free trade
rules.
	   Cuba, meanwhile, has increased its donations in the region from
an estimated dlrs 5 million in 1995 to perhaps dlrs 20 million,
said Antonio Jorge, professor of economics and international
relations at Florida International University.
	   While paling in comparison to U.S. totals, the Cuban aid is a
major national effort for a poor country, which also is providing
experts, scholarships and medical care to help its neighbors.
	   More than 200 Cuban engineers, technicians, doctors, health
workers and sports trainers are working throughout the Caribbean.
	   The Cubans include doctors at clinics in Dominica and engineers
in Grenada, where they are helping design a national stadium. Cuba
sent tons of fertilizer and vegetable seeds to farms in St. Kitts
and Nevis that were damaged by hurricanes. More than 240 Caribbean
students are on full scholarships at Cuban universities.
	   ``Things like scholarships, especially in the context of a small
country, are extremely significant,'' said Stephen Vasciannie,
senior lecturer in international law at the University of the West
Indies in Jamaica. ``In that respect, Cuba has shown that it is
intimately knowledgeable about Caribbean realities.''
	   The region's leaders are openly questioning the U.S. economic
embargo of Cuba, echoing criticism from European leaders and also
Pope John Paul II during his January trip to Cuba.
	   ``It is high time to cross the ideological divide and fully
embrace Cuba as part of the hemispheric family,'' Jamaican Prime
Minister P.J. Patterson said recently. He called the embargo
``counterproductive and inhumane.''
	   In the past year, the leaders of Barbados, Dominica, Jamaica,
St. Kitts and Nevis, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines have
visited Havana _ trips that few would have dared to make five years
ago.
	   The Grenadian prime minister, whose country was invaded by U.S.
troops in 1983 to oust a repressive regime friendly to Cuba, paid a
landmark visit to Havana last year.
	   Deep differences remain over Cuba's human rights record,
however. A conference of Caribbean journalists voted in May to
oppose Cuba joining the Caribbean Community unless Havana loosens
control of news media.
	   Cuba's response was typically chilly. ``Cuba does not accept any
political conditioning that has to do with the internal affairs of
our country,'' said its ambassador to Jamaica, Silvia Santos
Guisado.

	   Washington's campaign to isolate Fidel Castro's Cuba is rapidly
losing support, both in the region and among U.S. allies in Europe.
	   The Caribbean's small, poor nations see Cuba as a potential
diplomatic partner in getting their region more notice from the
United States.
	   Meanwhile, even conservative governments in Latin America see
little to fear from Cuba's communist regime in the post-Cold War
era, and Europeans are enticed by the island's business
opportunities.

Cuba's diplomatic isolation a thing of the past
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Cuba Goes Courting, Cuba-Eds Note &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ From Guatemala to Switzerland, from Spain to
the Dominican Republic, Cuba is making diplomatic breakthroughs
against decades of U.S. efforts to isolate it.
	   Many countries remain critical of Cuba's domestic politics, but
the United States is almost alone in trying to force changes by
freezing Cuba out of the international community.
	   ``We do not feel that Cuba should be penalized for its failure
to approach democracy at the dictate of any particular
government,'' Kenny Anthony, prime minister of St. Lucia and
chairman of the Caribbean Community trade bloc, said in early July.
	   American officials long denounced nearly any contact with Cuba.
Prodded by Washington, every country in the Western Hemisphere
except for Canada and Mexico cut ties with Cuba.
	   Now, all but El Salvador and Costa Rica have some sort of
diplomatic links with Fidel Castro's government. The visit by Pope
John Paul II to Cuba in January showed that anti-communism is no
bar to contacts with the communist island.
	   Many countries that once saw Cuba as a threat no longer do. Cuba
has stopped backing guerrilla forces in the Americas. And the
collapse of the Soviet bloc made Cuba itself seem less menacing.
	   The Soviet fall ``showed many that we were not a satellite of
anybody, that we had our own policies,'' said Abelardo Moreno of
Cuba's Foreign Ministry.
	   While U.S. officials say the wave of democracy across the
Americas has made Cuba an isolated oddity, it also has eliminated
all of the anti-communist military dictatorships that shunned Cuba.
	   In fact, free-market businessmen, Latin American nationalists
and leftists who rarely agree on other issues are united on Cuba,
resenting U.S. efforts to tell foreign businesses where they can
invest.
	   Almost all of America's allies have denounced U.S. laws
extending parts of the embargo to their own companies.
	   The European Union threatened to sue the United States at the
World Trade Organization. The Clinton administration has tried to
head that off by promising to avoid action against European
companies if Europe tries to voluntarily restrict some investments
in Cuba.
	   That alarmed Castro, who warned it could hurt the island.
	   But even that setback for Castro may be killed in Congress.
Castro's foes insist the embargo law should be enforced. European
officials say their trade complaint will be revived if Congress
shoots down the deal.
	   U.S. opposition is the primary stumbling block to Cuba's
readmission to the Organization of American States, from which it
was suspended in 1962.
	   But despite Washington's antipathy, few leaders seem reluctant
to visit the communist state. Canada's prime minister went in April
and Colombia's president was there in June. Once-hostile Guatemala
and the Dominican Republic reestablished full diplomatic relations
this year.
	   The U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva voted down a
U.S.-backed measure to condemn Cuba.
	   ``There are many countries, including allies of the United
States, who are fed up'' with the U.S. stand, Moreno said.
	   Cuba's Communist Party newspapers almost daily boast of meetings
that once would have enraged U.S. officials: The foreign ministers
of Mexico, Guatemala, Jamaica and two NATO countries _ Italy and
Portugal _ have all been to Cuba recently.
	   Visits by other European, African, Asian and Arab officials are
commonplace.
	   Cuban officials often have had to listen politely as foreign
visitors urge greater political freedoms or liberation of political
prisoners _ both prominent themes of Pope John Paul and of Canadian
Prime Minister Jean Chretien during their visits in Cuba.
	   Still, while the European Union has repeatedly criticized Cuba's
human rights record, it is moving toward closer economic ties.
	   Even a nasty spat with Spain's conservative government, which
caused the European country to keep its ambassador's post in Havana
vacant for 16 months, ended in April.
	   Spain's King Juan Carlos plans to visit Cuba next year along
with heads of state from throughout Latin America at an
Ibero-American summit in Havana.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ With a police sweep on democracy crusaders and a
nationwide communist ideology campaign, Chinese leaders are sending
unmistakable signals that their rule brooks no challenge.
	   But behind the arrests, trials and appeals to revolutionary
orthodoxy, no less a Communist Party standard-bearer than President
Jiang Zemin is said to be poring over potentially the most
subversive text in Beijing today: a special study on democracy.
	   Far from contradictory, the two approaches show that after years
of delay, China's leadership is thinking about reforming the
authoritarian political structure but is nervous over how to
proceed.
	   Senior party officials know they must lead or be led. With an
economy transformed by nearly two decades of capitalist-style
reforms, fewer Chinese work for agencies or industries controlled
by the government. Free markets, not fiats from Beijing,
increasingly hold sway.
	   Ensuring the success of government policies has become more
critical as the once-booming economy slows and divisions between
the newly better-off and newly left-out sharpen. Money-losing state
enterprises forced to cope with capitalism are laying off millions
of workers who face dim job prospects.
	   ``Fast economic growth over the past nine years has been the
single most important factor in social stability. This has
concealed the stagnation in political reform,'' said Fang Jue, a
former government economic planner and now a private businessman
who has lobbied for democratic reforms.
	   ``If there is an economic crisis, then there will be social
turmoil.''
	   A growing if quiet debate among academics about the need for
political change seemed to pick up this summer, as word spread that
the government-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences was preparing
in secret an extensive study on democratic systems worldwide.
	   Jiang, who also heads China's Communist Party, himself ordered
what some have dubbed ``the democracy project,'' and the recently
completed manuscript is now in his hands, according to sources who
took part in or are familiar with the study. Because of the work's
sensitivity, they spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Although the study takes in socialist forms of democracy, its
centerpiece is an examination of Western, particularly U.S.,
democracy with emphasis on constitutional government and a
multiparty system, the sources said.
	   An even more secretive study is being conducted by Wang Huning,
a Shanghai political scientist who heads Jiang's policy research
office. Wang is drafting a blueprint that could guide China from
its one-party communist political monopoly to a two-party system or
direct presidential elections, the sources said.
	   Jiang has kept his plans from all but a few of his closest
advisers; even his colleagues on the party's ruling Politburo are
said to have been left in the dark.
	   Speculation focuses on survival _ the party's and Jiang's. With
the political system less able to control the diverse economy, the
58 million-member party's authority is threatened. Under current
practices, Jiang, 71, will be under pressure in less than 5 years
to give up his jobs as president and party general secretary.
	   ``If the system is weak, Jiang Zemin's authority is weak,'' said
one source connected to Jiang's democracy project.
	   One Jiang adviser has suggested the party could be split in two,
allowing for some political competition. Under another scenario, an
amended constitution would sanction presidential elections. Jiang
could then hold on to power.
	   Jiang's flirtation with democracy has seemed to grow with the
rapprochement he began engineering with Washington last year. At
the end of U.S. President Bill Clinton's nine-day tour of China
this month, he supported Jiang as a visionary.
	   U.S. backing, however, cuts both ways. Clinton called on Jiang
to grant more personal freedoms to guarantee social stability.
Jiang promised to sign a key U.N. treaty on political and human
rights.
	   Into the breach stepped China's persistent dissident community.
On the day of Clinton's arrival, a group of democracy campaigners
announced the founding of the China Democracy Party, a political
opposition group to challenge the communists' monopoly. They
claimed to be seeking rights already granted in China's
constitution but seldom respected.
	   A week after Clinton left, the retrenchment began. Police have
so far detained 21 dissidents, 12 of them in connection with the
China Democracy Party.
	   The state-run propaganda apparatus launched a nationwide
campaign to study the works of Deng Xiaoping, Jiang's late mentor.
The Xinhua News Agency ran a denial that authorities had asked the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences to research political reforms.
	   ``This sent people a signal: now is not the time,'' said Pan
Wei, a politics professor at Peking University. ``Because layoffs
are having a destabilizing effect on society, they don't want to
stir up any new pressure on public opinion.''

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Life-time employment. Seniority-based promotions.
Cozy ties between member firms. The Mitsubishi group's traditional
ways of doing business were hailed in the 1980s as the keys to
rocketing to the pinnacle of Japan Inc. _ and world industry.
	   Those traditions have earned Mitsubishi a darker reputation in
the 1990s: stick in the mud.
	   As Japan searches desperately for an escape hatch out of its
deepest recession since World War II, the venerable Mitsubishi
empire has emerged not as a symbol of success, but a lesson in
what's wrong with the Japanese way of doing things.
	   ``The changes facing the Japanese economy are not short-term,
but structural, so the Mitsubishi group is pulling Japan back by
sticking to old ways,'' said Hiroshi Okumura, a professor in the
business studies department at Tokyo's Chuo University.
	   At Mitsubishi, the signs of malaise are in the ledger.
	   Japan's slide into recession has brought a drop in profits and
revenue at most Mitsubishi firms, including Mitsubishi Electric
Corp., Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and Nikon Corp. Only four of the
group's 25 core companies with publicly traded shares posted
increases in profit and sales for the fiscal year ended in March.
	   The group, made up of companies with large stakes in each other,
was dismembered after World War II. Mitsubishi was rebuilt in the
decades after the war, and now faces its toughest challenges since
grappling with the oil shocks of the 1970s.
	   ``The crisis which confronts the Mitsubishi group is much more
serious than it was 20 or 30 years ago,'' said Minoru Makihara,
chairman of Mitsubishi Corp., a trading house at the center of the
group.
	   That's quite a blow for Mitsubishi, whose core companies oversee
more than 250,000 workers in firms with combined earnings of
roughly 30 trillion yen (dlrs 216 billion) _ larger than the entire
economy of Austria.
	   Making products ranging from beer to rocket engines, the
Mitsubishi group has grown in tandem with Japan's transformation
from a feudal backwater in the 19th century into the world's
second-largest economy.
	   Just a few years ago, Mitsubishi seemed an emblem of the
Japanese challenge to corporate America. But the group's fortunes
peaked not long after its real estate arm, Mitsubishi Estate Co.,
snapped up Rockefeller Center in 1989. That jewel in the group's
crown was sold off _ at a loss _ seven years later as Japan's
economic miracle unraveled.
	   The economy is not coming back anytime soon. In a report issued
in July, Japan's Economic Planning Agency warned of a marked
decline in industrial labor productivity _ and called for
overhauling the traditional employment and management models which
have been championed by Mitsubishi.
	   At issue are the paternalistic business practices characteristic
of much of Japan Inc.: cooperation among related firms and
cradle-to-grave benefits for loyal workers. Mitsubishi even runs a
matchmaking service for its employees named after its distinctive
red trademark _ the ``Diamond Family Club.''
	   Among the staunchest defenders of Mitsubishi's conservative
style is Kentaro Aikawa, chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industry Ltd.
and de facto head of the group. He recently earned the enmity of
shareholders by speaking out publicly in favor of putting company
jobs ahead of profits.
	   Coming from a business baron those remarks sound odd. But they
are very much in line with the corporate principles laid down by
Yataro Iwasaki, the scion of a samurai clan who founded Mitsubishi
in 1873.
	   Once nurtured by government subsidies, Mitsubishi has long
harbored a commitment to broad national interests. Iwasaki's zeal
for public service is enshrined in the first of the group's
business principles: corporate responsibility to society.
	   Still, the fabled unity of Mitsubishi has begun to fray.
	   ``The individual companies have to survive by themselves. They
cannot depend on help from the group,'' said Yoshihiro Sakamoto, a
former top trade ministry official who now serves as an advisor at
The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd.
	   A solution to the group's woes has so far eluded the chief
executives from 28 core Mitsubishi firms, who gather once a month
for a brainstorming session in a top floor suite around a long oval
table, with a wooden Buddhist deity decorating one wall.
	   But some voices within Mitsubishi are calling for a drastic
restructuring to shed troubled units. Others seek more moderate
steps such as trimming bloated payrolls by getting rid of unneeded
workers.
	   The burden of history is heavy, however.
	   ``Japanese companies are destined to make cutbacks whether we
like it or not,'' said Katsuhiko Kawasoe, president of Mitsubishi
Motors Corp. ``But Mitsubishi can't be the first to do so.''

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ When Crystal Hanlon gave up on college, donned an
orange apron, and took a dlrs 5-an-hour cashier's job at retail
chain Home Depot, her friends scoffed and even sneered.
	   ``Back then, I used to get teased about working at a retail
store,'' she said.
	   Thirteen years later, her envious friends are more likely to ask
how much longer it will be before she becomes a millionaire.
	   ``My friends now are not nearly as financially stable as I am,''
she said. ``All of them would like to be in my position.''
	   Ms. Hanlon, who started with Home Depot in her hometown of
Houston, has risen in the home improvement chain and now manages a
store in suburban Atlanta. But the foundation of her financial
stability was built with stock in Home Depot, whose mammoth stores
filled with floor-to-ceiling shelves made hardware and lumber
shopping seem fun to ordinary Americans with cash to spend on their
houses.
	   Without disclosing precise numbers, the 33-year-old estimates
her holdings will hit seven figures not long after she hits 40.
	   Employee stock incentives have already created an estimated
1,000-plus millionaires at the Atlanta-based Home Depot. And the
orange-aproned elite ranges well beyond Arthur Blank and Bernie
Marcus, who founded the chain in 1978. Secretaries and workers
still in the aisles are reaping the benefits of a stock that has
risen about 80 percent in the past year.
	   Stock incentive programs have become increasingly common in
corporate America in the 1990s, with an expanding economy and tight
labor pool adding to the need for companies to attract and keep
employees.
	   ``Creating a good culture where people feel like they have a
stakehold in the company they work for is attractive,'' said
Michael Keeling, head of the Washington-based ESOP Association, a
trade group for employee stock ownership programs. ``Stock
compensation schemes are becoming incredibly commonplace. They are
becoming conventional wisdom.''
	   Some of the most dramatic success stories have come in
technology, where the generic term ``Microsoft millionaires'' now
applies to many techies who have struck it rich with their
fast-growing companies.
	   But the humble home-improvement business has contributed its
share of the nouveau riche, many of them from blue-collar
beginnings.
	   Home Depot, the industry leader, has stock option incentives for
management and administrative employees as well as a discount
stock-buying program open to nearly all its workers.
	   Its chief rival, Lowe's, also has numerous employees and
retirees who are stock millionaires. Employees with one year of
seniority at the North Wilkesboro, North Carolina-based company are
rewarded with Lowe's stock at the rate of 13 percent of pay.
	   Its strong earnings have made Lowe's stock program _ which won
it the ESOP Association's ``Public Company of the Year'' in May _ a
powerful and important recruiting tool as it continues to build new
stores during a time of labor shortages.
	   Both Home Depot and Lowe's recently announced 2-for-1 stock
splits, just one of many over the years. In fact, a single share of
Home Depot held since first issue in 1981 would be worth 113.91
shares today; One share of Lowe's held since first issue in 1961
would be the equivalent of 240 shares.
	   Employee stock has been ``one of the cornerstones of our
success'' at Home Depot, said Blank, the company's chief executive
officer.
	   ``We've always wance company, rising stock value provides a
regular morale boost for employees greeting customers on the front
lines.
	   ``It does create excitement,'' Ms. Hanlon said. When the stock
split was announced in May, ``everybody was just screaming through
the store.''
	   While stock-market dips can also quickly cut into stock wealth,
Home Depot's past performance and aggressive growth make it a
generally popular long-term buy on Wall Street.
	   And the stock option program is an imposing obstacle to outside
recruiters.
	   ``We stay at Home Depot because we love the company, and because
of the incentives. There's really no sense in going anywhere
else,'' Ms. Hanlon said.
	   Although the company says most of its stock-made millionaires
choose to keep working, some have retired early. One man who
declined to be identified said that, while ``not a fabulously
wealthy fat cat,'' he accumulated enough stock value to leave Home
Depot in his 30s.
	   The man said he didn't want his name used because he didn't want
to be hounded by stockbrokers and people pitching investment
schemes.
	   Anyway, he's sticking with what worked.
	   ``Home Depot is still the largest component of my portfolio,''
he said.

Mexico's vilified bankers blame government for bad-loan crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Nattily dressed and brimming with confidence,
the former banker known as ``the Divine One'' disdains accusations
that he and his one-time colleagues destroyed Mexico's banks and
left taxpayers holding the bag.
	   Humility is not Angel Rodriguez's long suit, despite accusations
that his Banpais bank lost dlrs 2 billion _ including dlrs 400
million in loans to his own family's companies _ before the
government seized the bank in 1995.
	   ``As a businessman and a human being I don't have anything to be
ashamed of,'' Rodriguez said in his luxurious offices on the 18th
floor of Mexico's World Trade Center.
	   Media darlings during the early 1990s, Rodriguez and his fellow
bankers were praised as financial geniuses helping propel Mexico's
backward economy into the 21st century. Rodriguez likes to show off
a scrapbook filled with clippings of interviews he gave to
financial magazines back then.
	   Now, many of the bankers are in prison or in hiding, vilified as
rogues who bankrupted financial institutions and left billions in
bad debts to be paid by taxpayers _ most of whom don't even have
savings accounts.
	   In all, the government assumed dlrs 65 billion in bad debts
after the 1994 peso devaluation and a 1995 spike in interest rates
swamped the freewheeling bankers. Even the building that houses
Rodriguez's office was seized by the government after its
developers went bankrupt.
	   Rodriguez, widely known as ``El Divino,'' has stayed out of jail
so far.
	   With their armies of lawyers, he and other bankers are now
launching a counteroffensive against the government, hoping to shed
their reputations as bad-loan villains.
	   They blame the crisis on government mismanagement and corruption
and on the perennial targets in developing nations _ the
International Monetary Fund and multinational corporations.
	   Rodriguez says the government regulators who seized his bank
continued to pay themselves his salary of a quarter-million dollars
a year and kept the golf club membership, bulletproof cars and
bodyguards. He also claims they lost nearly dlrs 1 billion in
ill-managed money market operations.
	   ``We are surely going to find illicit operations where loans
were given to nonexistent companies, using front men. We're also
going to find inflated collateral guarantees ... and the corruption
of government managers,'' Rodriguez said.
	   But in a country where the minimum wage is the equivalent of
dlrs 3.37 a day, Rodriguez gets little sympathy. For most Mexicans,
he represents the arrogance of power, an untouchable class they
believe robbed the country blind and will never go to prison.
	   After all, this is a man who on a recent court date used a
phalanx of lawyers to screen him from police waving an arrest
warrant for fraud and tax-evasion charges. He slipped into the
``sanctuary'' of a courtroom, where he stayed until a judge ruled
he could remain free on bail.
	   Not all former bankers have been as lucky.
	   One, Jorge Lankenau, returned a reporter's call using his
cellular phone from his jail cell in the Topo Chico prison in
northern Mexico to talk about his new-found sympathy for Mexico's
poor.
	   ``There are many important lessons to be learned in prison. It's
not a health spa,'' said Lankenau, the former director of Confia
Bank who is awaiting trial for allegedly bilking investors of dlrs
170 million.
	   Lankenau said criminal charges were brought ``only against the
smaller banks'' like his, while larger banks got preferential
treatment in the government bailout.
	   ``I think more of my colleagues should be here,'' he said. ``...
All of us bankers did the same thing.''
	   Many other bankers have easily evaded authorities. Even Lankenau
escaped house arrest late last year and disappeared for several
days before surrendering. ``I could have fled just as many others
did,'' he said.
	   Rodriguez fled to Spain after regulators discovered his bank had
too many bad loans with companies owned by him and other
shareholders. When Spanish police with a Mexican warrant showed up
to arrest him on his yacht docked in Ibiza, he jumped into the
harbor but was hauled out by officers.
	   Rodriguez said he dived in so his children wouldn't see him
arrested.
	   ``I was swimming toward a police boat. ... What do people think,
I was going to swim to the Caribbean?'' he said.
	   The biggest fish _ banker Carlos Cabal Peniche, accused of
looting as much as dlrs 700 million from Union-Cremi Bank _ has
never been caught. Almost all of that money will have to covered by
taxpayers, apparently including an illegal dlrs 4 million donation
to a ruling-party election campaign in Cabal Peniche's home state
of Tabasco.
	   Cabal Peniche apparently was tipped off in 1994 that he was
about to arrested. He fled the country just hours after the
warrants were issued.
	   Some reports have put Cabal Peniche in Spain, and there have
been reported sightings of him in Florida.
	   While some hide, Rodriguez and Lankenau are very public in
accusing the government of mismanagement, favoritism and corruption
in the banking crisis.
	   Lankenau said his bank was seized by regulators ``who are
traitors eager to enrich transnational corporations,'' referring to
the sale of Confia to New York-based Citibank earlier this year.
	   His nationalist-tinged campaign to burnish his reputation,
including broadsides against IMF economic policies, have had some
success in his hometown of Monterrey. Bumper stickers there read:
``Lankenau Yes, Citibank No.''
	   At Mexico City's palatial El Divino restaurant, named for
Rodriguez and owned by his brother, people still believe in The
Divine One.
	   ``I think he's not all that bad. The government hasn't told the
whole truth about the banking crisis,'' business executive Carlos
Guzman said, sitting amid nouveau-riche decoration that is a cross
between Chartres cathedral and Batman's cave.
	   Indications are that the bad bank loans _ which the government
agreed to cover in 1995 and now wants to make part of the national
debt _ went to some very well-heeled Mexicans.
	   ``What we have detected is a lot of multimillion-dollar loans to
millionaires,'' all unpaid, said Dolores Padierna, member of a
congressional commission investigating the crisis.
	   For now, Rodriguez says he wants to pay off his debts, which he
estimates at dlrs 120 million but the government puts at dlrs 400
million.
	   With his typical aplomb, he says: ``I have my ability. I have my
connections. ... I'll pay with those.''

The Lion's tale: Kosovo rebel commander `hunts Serbs very well'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; AP Graphic KOSOVO &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNE THOMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ON THE ROAD TO PRIZREN, Yugoslavia (AP) _ It's another
sweltering day in Kosovo province. Hills rise green in the
distance, and cornstalks in the valley stand still in the heat.
	   Suddenly a black Mercedes zooms around the bend and blocks an
approaching car. Out jump four men wearing camouflage and
brandishing Kalashnikov rifles. Their green berets sport the black
eagle patch of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Commander Lion is on the prowl.
	   Every day, this KLA leader and his men patrol a 13-mile
(21-kilometer) stretch of road, watching for Serb attacks. His
visitors this time are friendly, though, and after a peace offering
of cigarettes, the Lion consents to a brief audience.
	   He gives only his nom de guerre. His identity is secret, along
with the name of his village and the size of his fighting unit.
	   Still, he freely offers details of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian
rebel movement, its roots and how it grew. His hard-line goals
illustrate why foreign diplomats are having such a struggle
negotiating an end to the war between ethnic Albanians and Serb
forces.
	   Kosovo Albanians seeking independence from Serb-led Yugoslavia
stand on three sides. There's political leader Ibrahim Rugova, the
pacifist. There's a mellower branch of the KLA that leans toward
joining Rugova in a deal for autonomy.
	   And then there's the extremist branch of the KLA _ the Lion's
side.
	   They want nothing short of independence. They despise Rugova as
much as they hate Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. For them,
winning Kosovo is just a step toward more fighting, toward the
ultimate goal of redrawing Europe's borders to absorb parts of
Macedonia and Montenegro into ``Greater Albania.''
	   ``I don't know if Rugova is even Albanian. He could be a Serb.
For me, he's dead. I'd kill Rugova before Milosevic,'' says the
Lion, flashing his quirky smile of stained, crooked teeth. His men
laugh.
	   The Lion's sun-baked wrinkles make him look older than his 36
years. He is slight, slender and about 5-foot-8 (1.7 meters). But
he has the ease and charisma of a natural leader.
	   ``I don't look like a lion,'' he admits. ``But if I go out
hunting, I hunt Serbs very well.''
	   Back in 1981, the Lion was a biochemistry student at Pristina
University when Serbs cracked down on an Albanian uprising, leaving
80 people dead. That same year, he and his friends started planning
to free Kosovo from Serb control.
	   By 1991 _ seven years before the war started _ KLA cells were
training as guerrillas. In Kosovo, the Lion and his friends would
drill in the woods after soccer games. He also says rebels were
training in Germany and Albania.
	   He joined Rugova's party for three months, but found it too
soft. So to raise money for a tougher cause, the Lion went to
Germany in 1994 and worked construction in a town near Munich.
	   He was making dlrs 2,500 a month and spending most of it on KLA
propaganda and support-seeking trips to Albanian communities in
France, Switzerland, Slovenia and the Netherlands.
	   Then this spring, he opened a newspaper and saw pictures of the
conflict back home: The date was March 6, one day after a Serb
police crackdown in Prekaz village killed 50 Albanians, including
women, children and KLA leader Adam Jashari.
	   He left his wife and child in Germany, came back to Kosovo and
became the Lion.
	   ``If I die, so what?'' he says. ``It's not important because I
won't die sitting in Germany. If I die _ which hopefully won't
happen _ I'll die as a liberator of my country.''
	   The Lion spoke Thursday on one of two KLA-controlled roads to
Kosovo's capital, Pristina. Over the weekend, Serbs forces regained
one road _ but not the Lion's.
	   It was impossible to know if the Lion's unit was involved in the
weekend combat, but he claimed his snipers have repelled Serb tanks
in the past. The Lion is also a kidnapper: He once seized a
passenger bus, freeing women but keeping Serb police to trade for
KLA prisoners.
	   Stopping vehicles is his regular activity. He drives around in
his Mercedes with his guns and his boys, listening to patriotic
Albanian folk music until the time is right to pounce.
	   When a truck of aid workers pulls up, the Lion stops them for a
few minutes. He checks passports, jots names in a worn notebook and

Albright confronts Myanmar, China on human rights abuses
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM RAUM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright confronted several Asian nations at a conference,
criticizing Myanmar for blocking the movements of opposition leader
Ang San Suu Kyi and China for jailing dissidents after President
Bill Clinton's visit.
	   She said turmoil in Myanmar, still called Burma by U.S.
officials, was posing ``a threat to the stability of the region.''
	   As ministers of 20 Asian and Western countries and the European
Union met Monday at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
Regional Forum, Nobel laureate Suu Kyi spent a fourth day Monday
stuck in a car on a rural Myanmar highway surrounded by government
security personnel. She was arrested Friday on her way to a meeting
with supporters.
	   In denouncing the military-ruled government of Myanmar _ a
participant in the conference _ Albright said the United States
would hold it ``directly responsible'' for the health and welfare
of Suu Kyi.
	   Albright went public with her complaints after Myanmar Foreign
Minister Ohn Gyaw defended his nation's actions in a closed-door
session with participants.
	   Ohn Gyaw was asked by The Associated Press to comment on
Albright's concerns for Suu Kyi. ``Nothing will happen to her,'' he
said of the opposition leader.
	   The conference host, Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo
Siazon, said later that Albright's statement of concern was ``just
too vague'' for the rest of the group to adopt.
	   ``We have not seen any deterioration in (Suu Kyi's) health or
capacity to think,'' Siazon said.
	   Recounting her conversation with Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan, Albright told reporters she noted that China had released
some prisoners, but ``I made ... quite clear that arresting people
is not the way that we see follow through.''
	   A senior U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
said Albright was concerned about the arrests of about 20
dissidents after Clinton returned from 10 days in China earlier
this month. The Chinese delegation didn't respond directly to her
concerns, but ``they couldn't miss it'' as criticism, the official
said.
	   Despite Albright's sharp words for Myanmar and China, the annual
security forum of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
produced much agreement _ both on the need to do something to stop
Asia's economic crisis and a statement that ``strongly deplored''
nuclear tests in May by India and Pakistan.
	   In a statement, ministers from 19 of the countries plus the
European Union said the tests heightened tension in a region
already on edge from a growing economic crisis. The statement did
not mention the nations by name, only referring to two countries in
South Asia.
	   ``Since we know our geography too well, it was not necessary to
identify them,'' said Siazon said.
	   India dissented from the report and defended the tests it
carried out in May ``because the nonproliferation regime had turned
flawed and discriminatory.'' Pakistan was not a member of the
conference.
	   Albright said she made U.S. concerns over human rights known in
a meeting with Tang, the Chinese foreign minister.
	   ``While we both consider, and I especially, (that) one of the
major successes of the president's trip was to raise human rights
issues publicly in China, ... I did raise our concerns about some
of the recent arrests,'' she said.
	   Albright said she and Tang also discussed the House vote last
week endorsing Clinton's extension of normal-trade relations, a
vote Albright praised.
	   Meanwhile, Tang assured the United States it will follow through
on its pledge to stop targeting the 13 nuclear missiles it has
aimed at U.S. cities, although he did not say when _ or whether it
had already done so.
	   ``The Chinese people are a people who always honor our
commitments,'' Tang told reporters during a picture-taken session
at the start of the breakfast meeting with Albright.
	   The summit between Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin a
month ago yielded an agreement to stop aiming nuclear missiles at
each other.
	   Albright also discussed the upcoming summit meeting in Moscow in
September between Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
	   ``We have a mature partnership now,'' she said of the
U.S.-Russian relationship. ``We can hit the ground running,''
echoed Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who shared a news
conference podium with her.
	   High on the agenda of the September meeting, Albright said, will
be nonproliferation issues, the nuclear tests by Iran and Pakistan,
violence in Kosovo and the current financial crisis.
	   For his part, Primakov said Russia would work hard to fight its
way out of its own financial crisis. ``We, too, will have to
swallow that bitter pill,'' he said.
	   Of the highway standoff in Yangon, Myanmar, Albright said:
``Members of legal political parties are being prevented from
traveling in their own country,'' Albright said. ``The Burmese
economy is falling apart. ... Burma is a country in great and
growing stress today.''
	   Albright made her views known both in a speech to the conference
and at a news conference.
	   ``The Burmese representative here has just ... responded to the
allegations, and I think his response is quite typical of an
authoritarian government that just doesn't get it, that blames the
victim for the problem,'' Albright told reporters.

Ullrich beaten by rain, wind, Pantini

GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LES DEUX ALPES, France (AP) - Defending Jan Ullrich had a number
of things against him on Monday during the 15th stage of the Tour
de France
	   Rain, cold, wind.
	   But most of all a small Italian lightweight a large amount of
climbing ability
	   Marco Pantani, barely 60 kilos (132 pounds) and 1.70 meters (5
feet, 7 inches) rode through the wind and rain and away from the
pack with a convincing stage victory through bad weather conditions
and punishing climbs.
	   Tuesday's stage has five more climbs but all are between 950
meters (3,106 feet) and 2,000 meters (6,540 feet) with better
weather predicted.
	   Pantani prospered in the poor conditions on Monday.
	   ``I took the courage to start it and today I had the courage to
attack in the bad weather conditions,'' Pantani said. ``I took the
risks and held up under the pressure.''
	   The 15th stage from Grenoble to Les Deux Alpes, 189 kilometers
(117.5 miles) with four major climbs including two rated ``out of
category'' on a scale of steepness, height and length.
	   The hills were made worse with rain and fog throughout the day.
Temperatures dipped below 10 C (50 F) after Sunday's stage was more
than 30 C (86 F).
	   He gained nearly nine minutes over Ullrich, who dropped to
fourth overall.
	   Ullrich didn't have much to say after he was so beaten. He came
in 25th on the day, 8:57 back and is now 5:56 back in the overall
standings.
	   Pantani was in fourth place entering the day, 3 minutes, 1
second behind Ullrich. At the end of the day he had a lead of 3
minutes, 53 seconds over American Bobby Julich with Ullrich 5:56
back.
	   Walter Godefoot, the Telekom team director, knew what happened.
	   ``In principle, Jan has lost the Tour,'' Godefoot said. ``Of
course there is still the time trial. But in the time trial, we
can't take six minutes from Pantani.''
	   There are two more days in the Alps with an important time trial
coming up on Saturday, the next-to-last day of the Tour.
	   In the last time trial, Ullrich gained 4:21 over Pantani. Julich
had an advantage of 3:03 over Pantani.
	   Pantani captured the stage by almost two minutes over Italian
Rodolfo Massi and Spaniard Fernando Escartin, who moved into third
in the overall standings.
	   Julich came in fifth on the day, 5:43 behind Pantani. Ullrich
was 25th, 8:57 behind.
	   Julich tried to catch the Italian but couldn't come close on the
final climb.
	   ``I knew Pantani was dangerous but but I didn't think he could
do what he did today,'' Julich said.
	   ``He made us all look silly.''
	   But Ullrich has had own problems getting in shape. He was more
than 10 kilos (22 pounds) overweight earlier this year.
	   Ullrich weakened in the final climb. Ullrich kept having
trouble. He had a flat. He stopped to confer with his team car.
	   ``I saw after the flat he was exhausted.'' Godefoot said.
,,After that he lost his power.''
	   Nothing worked for Ullrich, losing more than three minutes to
Julich on the day.
	   In the drug scandal that has dominated the Tour, five cyclists
now admit taking banned substances and two leaders of a Dutch team
faced legal questioning.
	   The Tour already has been hit with sit-down strike by riders
angered by the attention given the scandal. Officials for the
cycling showcase reject calls to cancel the race.
	   ``There is no question of stopping the Tour,'' Tour director
Jean-Marie Leblanc told the French newspaper Liberation.

Sprewell gets home detention in reckless driving case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARTINEZ, California (AP) _ Latrell Sprewell was sentenced to
three months of home detention Monday after pleading no contest to
a reckless driving charge.
	   Sprewell, who was originally suspended for one year and had his
dlrs 24 million contract terminated by the Golden State Warriors
last season for choking coach P.J. Carlesimo, also was placed on
two years probation, fined dlrs 1,000 and ordered not to have a gun
in his possession.
	   Sprewell, who could have been sentenced to six months in jail,
told KGO-TV he agreed to plead no contest in order to put the case
behind him.
	   ``It's just been unfortunate,'' Sprewell said. ``I'm just trying
to move on. It seems like every day it's something new again.''
	   Sprewell swerved out of an exit-only lane on a Walnut Creek
freeway on March 1 and struck another car, injuring a couple.
	   The couple has said they intend to sue Sprewell in civil court.
	   Defense attorneys suggested the plea bargain to avoid
gavel-to-gavel coverage on Court TV. Jury selection was to have
begun Tuesday.
	   Last week, Municipal Court Judge Bruce Mills allowed Court TV's
request to televise the trial as long as it did not interfere with
the proceedings. However, because the charges were misdemeanor,
Sprewell would not have been required to attend the trial.
	   It was not immediately known when Sprewell's home detention
would begin, which will involve an electronic ankle monitoring
device. He has moved from Northern California but would not say
where.

Report: Suspects in Mexican massacre threatened in jail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's governmental human rights commission
said Monday that suspects in the massacre of 45 Indian villagers
have been threatened and subjected to extortion in prison.
	   Two suspects being held at the Cerro Hueco penitentiary in the
southern state of Chiapas were told they would have to pay dlrs 225
to avoid being beaten, the National Human Rights Commission
reported.
	   More than 150 people, including state officials and police
officers, have been charged or are under investigation in
connection with the killings of 45 women, children and men in the
Chiapas village of Acteal on Dec. 22. Many of them are imprisoned
in Cerro Hueco awaiting trial.
	   ``After interviewing the prisoners, the commission's personnel
concluded that indeed, certain prisoners ... demanded varying
amounts of money from the Acteal suspects in return for safety,''
the commission reported.
	   The commission also noted that the prisoners in Cerro Hueco _
many of them Indians _ had recreated political divisions existing
outside the prison, by dividing into opposing groups.
	   Chiapas has been split by a four-year-old rebel uprising. Some
residents sympathize with the Zapatista rebels, who staged a brief
armed uprising in January, 1994 demanding greater democracy and
Indian rights. Others sympathize with the government.
	   The victims in the Acteal massacre belonged to a group that
sympathized with the rebels, while the suspected killers identified
themselves as a ruling-party supporters.

As violence worsens, UN chief sends top UN envoy to Angola
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ With an upsurge of violence threatening
Angola's U.N.-brokered peace accord, the U.N. chief is sending a
top official, Lakhdar Brahimi of Algeria, on an emergency mission
this weekend to the west African nation.
	   Brahimi will urge the government, and in particular the former
rebel movement UNITA ``to desist from any action which could
undermine the peace process and to resume negotiations without
delay in order to fully and expeditiously implement the remaining
provisions'' of the 1994 peace accord, a statement said.
	   Brahimi, travelling as Secretary-General Kofi Annan's special
envoy, was to arrive in Angola this weekend, the statement said.
	   Fighting between the government and the former rebel movement
UNITA has spiraled in recent weeks, with a reported massacre last
week in which 215 people were killed, including 88 burned in their
huts, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Monday.
	   The U.N. Angola mission dispatched a team to northeastern Lunda
Norte province over the weekend to investigate the attack in the
diamond-mining village of Bula, about 250 miles (400 kilometers)
east of Luanda.
	   Team members were told by government officials that about 40
men, armed with AK-47 rifles, hand grenades and other weapons
carried out the attack, which also injured 70. The team flew over
Bula and reported it burned and deserted, Eckhard said.
	   Human rights workers interviewed 10 of the survivors, who blamed
the attack on UNITA. Armed men surround village, entered it killing
everybody they could before looting the place and burning it to the
ground, Eckhard said. The team was to return to the village this
week to continue the investigation.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ runs diamond-mining operations in
Lunda Norte. The diamonds provide the movement with hundreds of
millions of dollars annually, analysts say, but recent Security
Council sanctions have banned UNITA's diamond exports.
	   Brahimi is Secretary-General Kofi Annan's special representative
in his efforts at peacemaking and preventive diplomacy. He is also
the U.N. chief's special representative to Afghanistan.
	   His trip follows the June 26 death of Alioune Blondin Beye,
Annan's special representative to Angola, who perished along with
five members of the U.N. Angola mission and two pilots in a plane
crash near Abidjan, Ivory Coast.
	   Brahimi was to make recommendations about the future U.N.
presence in Angola, including whether a replacement special
representative should be named.
	   The government and UNITA signed a U.N.-brokered peace pact in
1994 to end their two-decade civil war, but lingering hostility
between them has delayed the agreement's full implementation.

Obuchi reportedly struggling to find finance minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's incoming leader is having trouble finding a
finance minister after the top candidate _ former Prime Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa _ said he didn't want the post, Japanese media
reported Tuesday.
	   Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, elected last week as president of
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party Party and nearly certain to be
voted premier by Parliament, had been reportedly leaning toward
Miyazawa, a ruling party elder and economic specialist.
	   But major newspapers reported that Miyazawa, 78, had told a
senior party executive he wasn't interested in the position because
he was too old.
	   The choice of Japan's next finance minister is crucial. The
country is facing its worst recession in decades, with record-high
unemployment, increasing bankruptcies, and a financial system
weighed down by mountains of bad debt.
	   The Yomiuri, Japan's largest mass circulation daily, said Obuchi
might still formally ask Miyazawa to take the post, but it wasn't
clear if Miyazawa would change his mind.
	   Another possible choice, Koichi Kato, former secretary-general
of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, also reportedly said he
wasn't interested in the finance job.
	   Kato cited his responsibility for the LDP's defeat in elections
to the upper house of Parliament earlier this month, the newspapers
said.
	   That electoral humiliation forced Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto to announce his resignation, which lead to Obuchi's
election as party president.
	   The third candidate Obuchi has been considering, former Chief
Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama, may still be offered the post
but he also appears unlikely to accept it, the reports said.
	   The newspapers didn't say who might become finance minister if
all three of the men under consideration turn it down.

	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Bente Nordby saved a penalty kick as
women's soccer world champion Norway beat Denmark 4-2 in a shootout
Monday night to win the bronze medal at the Goodwill Games.
	   The United States, 1996 Olympic women's soccer champion, faced
China in the gold-medal match.
	   Norway and Denmark tied 1-1 in regulation. Unni Lehn gave Norway
the lead in the 20th minute but Anne Nielsen tied it in the 82nd
minute. Denmark outshot Norway 6-3 but Nordby made five saves.
	   In the shootout, Nordby knocked away Denmark's first shot by
Nielsen and Norway clinched the bronze medal when Louise Hansen's
shot hit the right post.
	   Norway's Hege Russe, Linda Medalen, Pettersen and Henriette
Viker all scored on goalie Dorthe Larsen in the shootout. Gitte
Krogh and Janne Rasmussen converted for Denmark.
	   On a relatively light day of action, boxing began, and an
American scored a quick upset.
	   Bantamweight Antonio Rodriguez of Waianae, Hawaii, outpointed
world championship bronze medalist Soner Karaaoz of Turkey 9-1 in
the quarterfinals.
	   Other American winners included heavyweight DaVarryl Williamson
of Aurora, Colorado whose bout against Italy's Giocahino Mocerino
was stopped when Williamson landed a punch to the head;
welterweight Miguel Espino; and lightweight Jacob Hubdson.
	   Light-flyweight Jose Navarro of Los Angeles lost 9-2 to world
championship silver medalist Roel Velasco.

	   EAST MEADOW, New York (AP) _ The father of the young Chinese
gymnast who sustained spinal injuries when she fell head-first
during practice said he is confident his daughter will compete
again.
	   But Sang Lan's doctors on Monday dismissed earlier speculation
that the 17-year-old had regained feeling in her toes.
	   ``There is no change in her neurological exam,'' Dr. Brock
Schnebel, head physician of the Goodwill Games, told the AP
immediately after discussing treatment options with the parents.
	   Schnebel said she is on pain-killers but slept well after a full
day spent with her family and other visitors.
	   ``It's hard to shut her up and keep her calm, actually,'' he
said of the woman described by her parents as ``athletic and
courageous.''
	   Schnebel said her parents have not decided whether to move her
back to China and continue the treatment with the experimental
nerve-building drug she is now receiving, or to start her
rehabilitation in the United States.
	   She could be ready to fly as early as next week, he said.
	   ``I think her young age makes treatment easier,'' Schnebel said.
	   In the first interview with reporters since arriving in the
United States on Sunday, the parents thanked from the bottom of
their hearts the American and Chinese people for their assistance
and support. They said they were proud of their daughter.
	   ``When we first saw her my wife started to cry and then I
couldn't hold back the tears any longer and I cried too,'' said
Chen Xiuseng, her father. ``But she was so brave. She said `Mother,
Father, don't cry. Don't worry about me because the doctors are so
good and I have confidence I will recover.'''
	   Sang, China's 1997 national vault champion, had seven hours of
surgery on Sunday at Nassau County Medical Center to stabilize
bones in her spine that shattered last Tuesday when she fell on her
head while practicing vaults.

UNICEF chief acknowledges inefficiency in Sudan, but defends UN
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The head of UNICEF acknowledged criticism
of inefficiencies in the massive U.N. relief operation for
famine-stricken Sudan but defended the United Nations against
criticism that it hadn't stressed the scope of the crisis in time.
	   Carol Bellamy said she took seriously rebel claims of corruption
within the U.N. Sudan mission and said she would personally look
into them. She said she made that pledge in meetings in Sudan last
week with the rebels.
	   On Monday, rebels of the Sudan People's Liberation Army urged
donor nations to investigate claims of inefficiency and corruption
in Operation Lifeline Sudan, an umbrella organization for U.N. and
private relief agencies.
	   ``It is, therefore, no surprise that the response to the
humanitarian crisis and famine in Sudan, especially Bahr el-Ghazal,
is not showing the desired results,'' Pa'gan Amum, spokesman for
the Sudan People's Liberation Army, told a news conference in
Nairobi, Kenya.
	   The southwestern province is the worst hit by the war-induced
famine in Sudan. The United Nations says of the 2.6 million needy
Sudanese, 700,000 are in Bahr el-Ghazal.
	   Bellamy acknowledged the possibility of inefficiency simply
because of the operation's size _ the food drop is the largest in
the World Food Program's history. But, she said, the rebels have so
far failed to provide information to back claims of corruption.
	   ``I believe we have to take this seriously, but I have not, at
this point, been shown any information to back up ... the
allegation of corruption,'' Bellamy told a news conference.
	   ``This is an operation that is so big and multifaceted, that I
think we have to almost do somersaults to ... try to keep looking
for ways to make this more efficient,'' she added.
	   The dueling news conferences came as the Rome-based World Food
Program appealed Monday for an additional 51,150 tons of emergency
food for the coming year. In April, the U.N. agency appealed for
93,500 tons it said was needed through April 1999.
	   The agency also asked for dlrs 154.5 million to cover
operational costs through next April.
	   World Food Program Executive Director Catherine Bertini is
scheduled to testify Wednesday before a congressional committee in
Washington on the Sudan crisis.
	   Bellamy acknowledged criticism that reports of the scope of the
famine had been late in coming but blamed the delay on a government
ban on humanitarian access to Bahr el-Ghazal during January and
February.
	   Amum accused the U.N. umbrella group Operation Lifeline Sudan of
spending money on a ``large and expensive bureaucracy of
expatriates'' at its base in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, in the
northwestern Kenyan town of Lokichokio and in southern Sudan.
	   The operation in Lokichokio costs dlrs 3 million a year to run,
according to Operation Lifeline Sudan figures.
	   Bellamy said that a new base for food drops, in the central
Sudanese city of El Obeid, should help cut costs.
	   Amum also accused the aid agency's employees of inflating the
cost of food and supplies purchased in Kenya and Uganda in order to
take kickbacks.
	   He denied claims the SPLA has diverted relief food to rebels,
saying the food is distributed by aid workers and not the rebels.
	   Bellamy said U.N. officials had no specific information about
widespread looting of foodstuffs, but acknowledged that food could
be being redistributed on a smaller scale. U.N. agencies, the
rebels and international aid organizations were trying to work out
a way to prevent food from being diverted, she said.
	   Sudan has been embroiled in a 15-year civil war in which
southern rebels are seeking autonomy for Christians and animists
from the Muslim north. An estimated 1.5 million people have died in
the fighting and accompanying famines.

Heat wave doesn't slow Byron Black
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ A record heat wave failed to cool off former
Southern Cal star Byron Black of Zimbabwe, the seventh seed who
defeated Sjeng Schalken of the Netherlands 6-4, 7-6 (10-8) in
opening play at the dlrs 340,000 Mercedes-Benz Cup men's tennis
tournament.
	   Temperatures over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) on
the courts of the Los Angeles Tennis Center on the UCLA campus.
	   ``This is almost like my second home,'' Black said. ``People
really get into that USC-UCLA thing, but I'm past college now.
Sjeng is a hot and cold player. It comes down to more of a fitness
contest in this heat. I tried to outhustle him at the end.''
	   Schalken had four set points in the second set tiebreaker, but
was unable to capitalize.
	   ``Towards the end, Sjeng played loose, almost as if he didn't
care,'' Black said.
	   Black's brother, Wayne, however, wasn't as fortunate, losing to
Martin Damm of the Czech Republic 2-6, 7-5, 6-0.
	   Wild-card Justin Gimelstob overpowered Daniel Vacek of the Czech
Republic, 6-4, 6-0, and Australian Andrew Ilie downed MaliVai
Washington 6-4, 6-1.
	   In other first-round play, Denmark's Kenneth Carlsen beat Oscar
Burrieza of Spain, 7-5, 6-4, Italian Gianluca Pozzi ousted
Argentina's Guillermo Canas 6-2, 6-4, and Jan-Michael Gambill
topped Steve Campbell 6-4, 6-4.
	   Wimbledon champion Pete Sampras, the world's No. 1 player, was
scheduled to play, but withdrew due to a foot injury. He was
replaced by last year's U.S. Open champion, Australian Patrick
Rafter, as the top seed. Rafter will play Tuesday night, as will
fifth-seeded Andre Agassi.
	   Monday night's featured match is between fourth-seeded Thomas
Enqvist of Sweden and 17-year-old qualifier Taylor Dent of Newport
Beach, California.

Cuban cyclist reported missing as team returns home
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A Cuban cyclist was missing from his team as it
returned home from the Goodwill Games Monday and officials said the
case had been turned over to law-enforcement agencies.
	   Ivan Dominguez was last seen when he left his hotel room on
Staten Island around 7 p.m. Sunday night ``and has not been seen
since,'' a statement from the games' organizers said.
	   ``No contact has been made with the Goodwill Games,'' the
statement said. ``This is now a matter for law-enforcement agencies
to handle. Should he surface, the appropriate authorities will
assume jurisdiction.''
	   An official with the Cuban delegation confirmed that Dominguez
had left the team.
	   ``He's been missing since yesterday (Sunday). He has not
returned to Cuba's hotel after a short leaving. We don't know where
he actually is,'' the official said, speaking on the condition that
he not be identified.
	   City police said the case was not in their jurisdiction and
would be handled by the States Deaprt. In Washington, State
Deptartment spokeswoman Marva Long said she knew nothing about the
matter.
	   Dominguez, 22, from Playa, Cuba, competed for a Pan American
all-star team in the cycling at Wagner College on Staten Island
Saturday and Sunday. The team placed sixth.
	   The possibility of defections by Cuban athletes arises whenever
they compete outside their homeland, and Goodwill organizers had
talked privately in recent days about the chances of athletes
disappearing as their return to the economically strapped communist
island neared.
	   Two members of Cuba's national swim team disappeared from a
Puerto Rican camp where they were training for the Goodwill Games
earlier this month. Nubis Rosales and Daimara Munoz later said they
planned to defect to the United States.
	   In 1993, 43 Cuban athletes defected during the Central American
and Caribbean Gamesg asylum in third countries.
	   Top Cuban athletes receive favored treatment, but salaries run
about dlrs 10 per month and living standards pale beside those of
millionaire athletes abroad.
	   In 1996, a 15-year-old Cuban baseball player who says he could
no longer trust his teammates defected to the United States.
Catcher Yalian Serrano Castro was in the country for the Junior Pan
American Baseball Championships outside St. Louis.
	   And at the Olympics in Atlanta that summer, star pitcher Rolando
Arrojo defected and was branded a traitor by Cuban leader Fidel
Castro. Longtime boxing coach Mariano Leyva also sought political
asylum during the Summer Games.

At least 7 dead, nine injured in bus crash in southern France
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Three buses rammed into each other in a pileup on a
highway in southern France, killing at least seven people and
injuring another nine seriously, police said early Tuesday.
	   The accident took place on the A7 highway near Savasse, a small
town located about 600 kilometers (400 miles) south of Paris on the
country's main north-south axis.
	   Police said the accident involved three buses and a truck. It
appeared that the crash took place when one of the vehicles slowed
down. No further details were immediately available.
	   Pileups occur often on France's major highways.

Sainz becomes most successful rally driver
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Spain's Carlos Sainz was basking in
the glory Tuesday of becoming the most successful rally driver in
history after winning the Rally of New Zealand for the fourth time.
	   The Toyota driver finished the 25-stage rally Monday in 3 hours,
54 minutes, 57.1 seconds to record his 22nd world rally
championship victory _ one more than Finn Juha Kankkunen _
finishing 4.1 seconds ahead of his French teammate Didier Auriol.
	   Sainz, whose victory in New Zealand also sees him move three
points above Scotsman Colin McRae to lead the championship, had
trailed Auriol by 30.4 seconds overnight Sunday night but soon
turned that into an advantage after the Frenchman spun on the
opening stage and lost 40 seconds.
	   Auriol twice regained the lead from Sainz, but the Spaniard was
not to be denied and went back in front after the 23rd stage at
Mangatawhiri.
	   ``This win is both important and special for me,'' said Sainz,
who won the opening rally of the championship in Monte Carlo in
January. ``To set a new record of world rally championship wins is
very nice, but it is just as important to score victory at this
stage in the championship.
	   ``The last few events didn't produce the results I wanted so it
was vital to score well here.''
	   Auriol, who won five of the eight stages on Sunday, had seen his
worries about being first on the road become reality when the heavy
rain gave way to blue skies.
	   ``I was always worried that being the first car on the road
would be a disadvantage in the dry _ I was definitely cleaning the
road for the others,'' said Auriol, whose second place helped
Toyota take the lead in the manufacturers' championship.
	   Auriol was not the only driver to have trouble on the grueling
Te Koraha stage, run twice at the start of the final leg. British
pair Richard Burns and McRae both lost places after problems on the
first and second running respectively.
	   Burns, third overnight and one place ahead of McRae, lost almost
15 minutes to drop to 14th after rolling his Mitsubishi 12
kilometers (7 miles) from the end of the stage.
	   Subaru driver McRae suffered a puncture halfway through the
stage to drop to fifth behind reigning champion Tommi Makinen and
Kankkunen.
	   ``It was a disaster really,'' said McRae, who has won the New
Zealand Rally three times. ``It was looking very good in the
morning.''
	   The next round in the world championship is the Rally of Finland
in Jyvaskyla from Aug. 21-23. There, Makinen's rivals will try to
break his four-year winning streak at the event.

Dollar higher, Tokyo stocks rise in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar edged higher against the yen early
Tuesday amid continued concern over the ability of Japan's incoming
administration to revive the economy. Tokyo stock prices rose
slightly.
	   The dollar bought 142.52 yen in early trading, up 0.18 yen from
late Monday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate of
142.41 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained
60.98 points, or 0.38 percent, to 16,005.34 in the first 30 minutes
of trading. On Monday, the average lost 417.53 points, or 2.55
percent.
	   Concern about the outlook for Japan's economic and banking
reforms under a new Cabinet had dampened sentiment in trading
Monday.
	   Market players worried that Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's
expected replacement, Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, won't push
through tough economic reforms.
	   Japanese news media said Tuesday Obuchi had sounded out former
Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, 78, to assume the post of finance
minister, but that Miyazawa reportedly was declining because of his
age.
	   Stock prices opened slightly higher following an overnight rise
on Wall Street, in which the Dow Jones industrial average closed at
9,028.24 points on Monday, up 90.88.
	   Trading in Tokyo remained light as many investors retreated to
the sidelines to await the selection of the new Cabinet on
Thursday.
	   Shares in Daiwa Securities jumped 42 yen (29 cents) to 628 yen
(dlrs 4.41) per share in early trading, while Sumitomo Bank stock
rose 14 yen (10 cents) to 1,335 yen (dlrs 9.37) on reports they
have agreed to form a joint investment-banking venture.
	   The two companies were to hold a news conference later Tuesday,
the reports said.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.300 percent from Monday's finish of 1.315 percent,
driving its price up to 111.10 yen from 111.00 yen.

Sports minister takes issue with Samaranch's comments on drugs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Federal Sports Minister Andrew Thomson
said Tuesday it's appalling that Australia's efforts to fight drug
use at the 2000 Sydney Olympics has been undermined by comments
from Juan Antonio Samaranch.
	   Thomson said he would be seeking urgent clarification from the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) president regarding
Samaranch's comments that the list of banned substances should be
``drastically reduced.''
	   Samaranch was quoted in the Spanish paper El Mundo on Sunday as
saying the list of banned substances should be ``drastically''
reduced and that drugs which don't damage an athlete's health
should not be prohibited.
	   ``Doping now is everything that, firstly, is harmful to an
athlete's health and, secondly, artificially augments his
performance,'' he was quoted as saying. ``If it's just the second
case, for me that's not doping. If it's the first case, it is.''
	   Thomson said if Samaranch confirms his comments the Australian
government would be writing to the Olympic boss distancing itself
from his views.
	   ``It's appalling that we are here doing our best to fight
against drugs and our politicians should be undermined by people
beyond our borders,'' Thomson said at a media conference.
	   With the Sydney Games in mind, the federal government has spent
US dlrs 1.9 million in its fight against drugs in sport and Thomson
said a comprehensive anti-doping strategy would be released within
weeks.
	   Thomson said he burst into laughter when he first read about
Samaranch's comments.
	   ``If true it's the most extraordinary thing anyone has ever said
in elite sport,'' he said.
	   ``No one could understand someone coming here, the head of a big
movement, and making some strong statements about anti-doping, just
last April, and then uttering something that is apparently entirely
contradictory to it a few months later. It's too bizarre to be
true.''
	   Michael Knight, chief of the Sydney Olympic organizing committee
(SOCOG), also said Samaranch's comments were at odds with his views
over the past year.
	   ``If he's saying that he's backing away from a strong stance
against doping, I'd be concerned,'' Knight told Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   ``If he's saying that they need to simplify the procedures
because at the moment you virtually need a degree in biochemistry
to work out what you can take and what you can't take . . . then
that would be a different matter.''
	   Knight said he also planned to speak to Samaranch within the
next 24 hours. (djp)

Government threatens to sue FINA
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ The West Australian state government has
threatened to sue swimming's world governing body FINA for a US
dlrs 1.25 million shortfall from the world championships in
January.
	   Swiss-based FINA signed on as underwriters to the January event,
which failed to attract the level of sponsorship anticipated by the
state government, Sport Minister Norman Moore said Tuesday.
	   ``They say they're not obliged to give anything at all, and
they've offered to pay half that money,'' Moore said.
	   ``The bottom line is that FINA underwrote that money and we're
calling on that to be honored.''
	   Moore and Australian Swimming, which was negotiating with FINA
on the state government's behalf, have written to FINA's Bureau
members requesting the payment.
	   ``Legal action will arise if they don't pay the money,'' Moore
said.
	   The minister said FINA was meeting in Dubai in November, and the
government was prepared to wait until then for the payment.
	   FINA secretary Gunnar Werner was unaware of a problem with the
contract, saying negotiations with Australian Swimming were
continuing.
	   ``We have discussed the matter and negotiations are going on but
not really with the W.A. (state) government, more with Australian
Swimming,'' Werner told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   Australian Swimming president Terry Gathercole confirmed his
organization had asked FINA to pay up.
	   ``We are of the opinion the contract we have with FINA is
valid,'' he said. ``We are entitled to ask FINA to meet its
obligations under the contract.'' (djp)

Military, police officers indicted in assassinations of leftists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Four high ranking army officers and one
from the national police have been indicted in the assassinations
of seven leftists under the former military dictatorship of Gen.
Augusto Pinochet.
	   In announcing the indictments Monday, Judge Hugo Dolmetsch said
his investigation will continue and that ``other indictments may be
issued soon.''
	   The assassinations occurred in 1987, and were part of an
operation launched by the now-disbanded secret police of Pinochet
in which 12 members of a pro-communist urban guerrilla group were
killed almost simultaneously in four houses in Santiago.
	   The government at the time said the deaths occurred in clashes
when the leftists resisted the arrest.
	   Three army colonels indicted, including one retired, were
arrested and taken to military barracks according to law because of
their military ranks. The others, a police colonel and army
captain, were expected to be arrested soon.
	   Dolmetch said he has received ``cooperation from all the
institutions involved'' in his investigation, apparently referring
to the army and the national police.
	   He said all the indicted officers were members of Pinochet's
feared security agency, known as CNI.
	   Pinochet ruled from 1973 to 1990.

Brother of jailed Cali cartel boss captured by army
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A jailed Cali cartel kingpin tipped
authorities off to the whereabouts of his wheelchair-bound half
brother, who was arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking.
	   The army seized Jose Manuel Herrera on Monday at a northern
Bogota apartment. He is wanted by prosecutors on charges of illegal
enrichment and money laundering.
	   Herrera is the half-brother of Elmer ``Pacho'' Herrera, once the
Cali cartel's third-ranking member who was arrested in 1996 and is
serving a six-year prison term in Colombia.
	   The jailed kingpin turned in his half brother in return for an
undisclosed sentence reduction, said a spokesman for the Cali
public prosecutor's office who requested anonymity. The spokesman
said Jose Manuel Herrera was paralyzed in a traffic accident in New
York City. The suspect's age was not given.
	   Police earlier this month arrested ``Pacho'' Herrera's cousin,
Pedro Nel Herrera, and said they suspected he was linked to a 7-ton
U.S.-bound cocaine shipment seized July 11 in the Caribbean port
city of Cartagena.
	   Most of the leaders of the Cali cartel have been killed or
captured, but the flow of cocaine out of Colombia has remained
constant and is now smuggled by smaller, more discrete
organizations.

Iraq nuclear report says intrusive, long-term monitoring necessary
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous with details from report &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Though acknowledging they've found no
evidence that Iraq is maintaining its nuclear program, U.N. weapons
inspectors are urging the Security Council continue a rigorous and
intrusive monitoring effort.
	   A report from the International Atomic Energy Agency was
scheduled to be considered Wednesday by the Security Council, where
Russia, China and France have sought to end inspections in favor of
less intrusive monitoring of known Iraqi research facilities.
	   Council sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was
unlikely the council would take any action on the report and would
instead wait for a regular October review.
	   The report repeated inspectors' previous statements that they
haven't found any evidence that Iraq could still produce
weapon-usable nuclear material.
	   But Baghdad continues to conceal information about its previous
nuclear abilities, and this lack of transparency has resulted in
uncertainties about the extent of foreign assistance to the
program, the report said.
	   ``It is also clear that there remains in Iraq a considerable
intellectual resource in the form of the cadre of well-educated,
highly experienced personnel who were employed in Iraq's
clandestine nuclear program,'' the report said.
	   It said ``effective, ongoing monitoring and verification in Iraq
... must be comprehensive and rigorous and, as a result, is
intrusive,'' it said.
	   Baghdad must destroy all weapons of mass destruction _ including
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons _
before the council will lift crippling economic sanctions imposed
in 1990 after President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, triggering
the Gulf War.
	   While the IAEA carries out the nuclear inspections, the U.N.
Special Commission handles the missiles and chemical and biological
agents.
	   In May, after the latest IAEA report, Russia suggested less
intrusive monitoring of known Iraqi nuclear research facilities
replace inspections. The United States objected, saying too many
questions still remained about Iraq's nuclear capabilities.
	   The council agreed to put off any decision on monitoring until
Iraq made ``substantive clarifications'' about its nuclear weapons
program. The council asked the IAEA to report back to them by July.
	   Monday's report, however, appeared to shed little new light on
the program. It was unclear if the United States would acknowledge
that the IAEA had done all it could do with the inspections, which
some council diplomats have suggested.
	   The document noted some areas of improvement, such as the IAEA's
determination that a so-called High Government Committee on Iraq's
nuclear program was of little practical significance.
	   However, it disputed Baghdad's claims that the late Lt. Gen.
Hussein Kamel al-Majid _ a son-in-law of President Saddam Hussein _
was solely responsible for Iraq's program.
	   ``It is beyond debate that concealment of components of Iraq's
clandestine nuclear program continued until at least August 1995,''
the report said. ``It remains difficult for the IAEA to distinguish
the actions of such a senior government official from that of the
government itself.''

New Zealand government loses majority, but stays in power
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAY LILLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ The New Zealand government
coalition Tuesday lost it's one-seat majority in Parliament after a
member defected citing ``a long list of deceits and betrayals'' by
Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters.
	   But Prime Minister Jenny Shipley has maintained her hold on
power after securing the support of at least one independent
legislator.
	   The National Party-led governing coalition also holds a firm
eight-vote commitment from the ACT New Zealand Party which ensures
it will win votes of confidence and supply, or money bills, in
Parliament.
	   Shipley said Tuesday the government ``continues to enjoy a
significant majority on confidence and supply'' and that stability
of government was assured.
	   Shipley, who said last week she considered calling an early
election to end infighting among the coalition, said there was ``no
threat whatsoever to the government's commitment or ability to
deliver quality government.''
	   There was no significant reaction from financial markets, which
had expected the defection.
	   The latest flare-up follows a row last week in populist Peters'
New Zealand First Party, during which five Maori legislators
threatened to quit because of conflict over policies and race
issues with party colleagues.
	   New Zealand First legislator Neil Kirton followed through on the
threat and Tuesday quit the party caucus.
	   ``A long list of deceits and betrayals by Winston Peters of his
own caucus, NZ First caucus, NZ First policies and principles and
tens of thousands of people who voted for the party at the last
election, have forced me from the party today,'' Kirton told
reporters.
	   ``I couldn't stay a day longer under Peters' leadership knowing
that he had turned his back on promises made at the last election
and in the certain knowledge that nothing was going to change,'' he
said.
	   Kirton, a junior health minister until he was sacked by Peters,
who is also Treasurer, said the ``last straw'' was Peters' economic
management.
	   His resignation leaves New Zealand First with 16 votes and
Shipley's National party 44, giving the government coalition 60 of
Parliament's 120 votes.
	   But with the support of ACT and with two other independent
legislators saying they were prepared to strike a deal to keep
Shipley in power, the government's position appeared safe.
	   Kirton, disaffected since his sacking last year, recently
stepped-up attacks on Peters, criticizing government spending cuts
and defying Peters' threat to expel rebel legislators.
	   Kirton said he would vote with the Labor opposition, and in
effect had joined the opposition benches.
	   ``Peters and New Zealand First have lost their souls and appear
to no longer care for the so many New Zealanders who are missing
out on a fair share of the economy gains,'' Kirton said.
	   Kirton said New Zealand First deserved its recent falls in
opinion polls, down from a high of 28 percent to around two
percent.

<TEXT>
	   EAST MEADOW, New York (AP) _ The father of the young Chinese
gymnast paralyzed in a practice fall at the Goodwill Games said
Monday he is confident his daughter will compete again.
	   Sang Shisheng and his wife, Chen Xiufeng, gave their first
interview since arriving in the United States on Saturday, four
days after 17-year-old Sang Lan landed head-first while practicing
for the vault.
	   ``When I first saw my daughter laying on the sick bed, my heart
was so hurt that she looked at me and said, `Mother, don't worry
about me because the doctor here and the medicine here is very,
very good. You have to have confidence. You have to have courage to
allow me to recover,''' Chen said through an interpreter.
	   Sang Shisheng said his daughter was concerned only with others
during that first visit.
	   ``When my wife saw my daughter, she started crying,'' he said
through an interpreter. ``So my tears also dropped and my daughter
saw us crying and she said: `Mother, Father, don't cry, be strong,
OK?' She asked about the results of the other gymnasts. She also
asked her mother, `When you come over to America, who takes care of
your work? Be strong.'''
	   Sang Shisheng was certain his daughter would compete again, let
alone walk.
	   ``I am sure she will be back to the competition circle because
she is very courageous and with the excellent medical (care), the
doctors and hospitals in America, I am sure she will one day be
back to the contest,'' he said.
	   But Sang Lan's doctors on Monday dismissed earlier speculation
that she had regained feeling in her toes.
	   ``There is no change in her neurological exam,'' Dr. Brock
Schnebel, head physician of the Goodwill Games, told The Associated
Press after discussing treatment options with the parents.
	   Schnebel said Sang was on pain-killers but slept well after a
full day spent with her family and other visitors.
	   ``It's hard to shut her up and keep her calm, actually,'' he
said of the woman described by her parents as ``athletic and
courageous.''
	   Schnebel said Sang's parents have not decided whether to move
her back to China and continue the treatment with the experimental
nerve-building drug she is now receiving, or to start her
rehabilitation in the United States.
	   She could be ready to fly as early as next week, he said.
	   ``I think her young age makes treatment easier,'' Schnebel said.
	   Sang, China's 1997 national vault champion, had seven hours of
surgery Saturday at Nassau County Medical Center to stabilize bones
in her spine that shattered last Tuesday when she fell.
	   On Sunday night, she had other visitors besides her parents.
	   ``The team manager, the trainer and the coach and all the
members of the team went to see her, and many of them, they cannot
hold themselves, they cried a little bit,'' Sang Shisheng said.
``But Sang Lan, she did not have even one drop of tears. Rather,
she asked her fellow gymnasts what medals did they get; did you get
gold medal or what? And, also asked the coach: `Why this time I
failed?'''

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A Cuban cyclist was missing from his team as it
returned home from the Goodwill Games and officials said the case
had been turned over to law-enforcement agencies.
	   Ivan Dominguez was last seen when he left his hotel room around
7 p.m. Sunday night ``and has not been seen since,'' a statement
from the games' organizers said Monday.
	   ``No contact has been made with the Goodwill Games,'' the
statement said. ``This is now a matter for law-enforcement agencies
to handle. Should he surface, the appropriate authorities will
assume jurisdiction.''
	   An official with the Cuban delegation confirmed that Dominguez
had left the team.
	   ``He's been missing since yesterday (Sunday). He has not
returned to Cuba's hotel after a short leaving. We don't know where
he actually is,'' the official said, speaking on the condition that
he not be identified.
	   Christian Jimenez Molena, the Cuban Goodwill Games team leader,
said Dominguez was not with the other cyclists when they departed
Monday morning but that his visa runs until Aug. 3, the day after
the games end.
	   ``If he is not back by then, maybe we can say he left,'' Molena
said. ``And if he left, that's his problem.''
	   City police said the case was not in their jurisdiction and
would be handled by the State Department. In Washington, State
Department spokeswoman Marva Long said she knew nothing about the
matter.
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service also said it had no
information on the case.
	   Dominguez, 22, from Playa, Cuba, competed for a Pan American
all-star team in the cycling at Wagner College on Staten Island
Saturday and Sunday. The team placed sixth.
	   The possibility of defections by Cuban athletes arises whenever
they compete outside their homeland, and Goodwill organizers had
talked privately in recent days about the chances of athletes
disappearing as their return to the economically strapped communist
island neared.
	   Two members of Cuba's national swim team disappeared from a
Puerto Rican camp where they were training for the Goodwill Games
earlier this month. Nubis Rosales and Daimara Munoz later said they
planned to defect to the United States.
	   In 1993, 43 Cuban athletes defected during the Central American
and Caribbean Games in Ponce, Puerto Rico.
	   Four prominent Cuban baseball players and a coach reached the
Bahamas last month on a raft, seeking asylum in third countries.
	   Top Cuban athletes receive favored treatment, but salaries run
about $10 per month and living standards pale beside those of
millionaire athletes abroad.
	   In 1996, a 15-year-old Cuban baseball player who says he could
no longer trust his teammates defected to the United States.
Catcher Yalian Serrano Castro was in the country for the Junior Pan
American Baseball Championships outside St. Louis.
	   And at the Olympics in Atlanta that summer, star pitcher Rolando
Arrojo defected and was branded a traitor by Cuban leader Fidel
Castro. Longtime boxing coach Mariano Leyva also sought political
asylum during the Summer Games.

Capriati taking different path in comeback attempt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STANFORD, California (AP) _ A few years ago, Jennifer Capriati
was a center-court attraction at Grand Slam tournaments. Now, she
has to play qualifying matches just to get into tour events.
	   Capriati reached the main draw of the dlrs 450,000 Bank of the
West tournament Monday by winning a qualifying match against
Mercedes Paz, who was playing the last singles match of her 15-year
pro career.
	   ``I'm in the best shape that I have been in a while,'' said
Capriati, ranked 117th in the world after having reached as high as
No. 6 as a teenager in the early 1990s.
	   ``It's been frustrating, though, because every time I get in
shape and things are going well, something happens to set me back
like an injury. I'm working out now to make sure I don't get
injured.''
	   Capriati was 14 in 1990 when she reached the semifinals of the
French Open in her first Grand Slam event. She had earned dlrs 1
million and won an Olympic gold medal by shortly after her 16th
birthday.
	   But she fell victim to burnout and drugs, dropping off the
circuit in 1993. She made a comeback attempt in late 1994 that
lasted just one match. Her latest comeback began in 1996, but has
been slowed by injuries.
	   This year, she has failed to get past the quarterfinals of any
tournament. She returned to Wimbledon for the first time since
1993, losing in the second round. Now 22, Capriati said she's
motivated again and trying to spend more time on the practice
court.
	   ``Actually, I'm being more serious now,'' she said. ``I'm trying
to get back up to the top. That's what I really want.''
	   Capriati, who did not lose a set in her three qualifying
matches, defeated Paz 6-2, 6-4. She will face Corina Morariu in a
first-round match Tuesday night.
	   Paz, 32, who is focusing on doubles as her career winds down,
said the loss to Capriati will be her last singles match. After
being overpowered by Capriati, she wished the victor luck in her
comeback attempt.
	   ``I think it's a good challenge for Jennifer and it's very good
that she has tennis,'' Paz said.
	   Another player trying to make a comeback, Steffi Graf, is seeded
fourth in the tournament despite falling to No. 57 in the world
since having reconstructive left knee surgery last year.
	   Graf and top three seeds Lindsay Davenport, Monica Seles and
Venus Williams all have first-round byes and will not play until
Wednesday at the earliest.

Malaysian jetliner with 163 passengers makes unscheduled landing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A jetliner with 163 passengers on
board made an unscheduled landing in northern Malaysia after a
smoke alarm indicator on board the plane went off, a newspaper
reported Tuesday.
	   The Malaysian Airlines flight from Kuala Lumpur to the southern
Indian city of Madras was grounded late Sunday for more than two
hours as technicians checked the aircraft for possible defects, the
Star newspaper said.
	   The Airbus jet continued on its journey after ground staff
certified it was safe and that there was no fire.

Strong earthquake rocks eastern Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A strong earthquake rocked a city in
eastern Indonesia, but there were no reports of damage or
casualties, an official said Tuesday.
	   The magnitude 5 quake jolted Ambon and surrounding areas at
10:54 p.m. (1354 GMT) Monday, said Suhardjono of the Meteorology
and Geophysics Agency.
	   He said the quake was centered about 40 kilometers (25 miles)
southwest of Ambon, the capital of Maluku province, which is about
2,300 (1,437 miles) northeast of Jakarta.
	   The tremor was also felt in Ternate in northern Maluku and Tual
in southeastern Maluku.
	   Indonesia, the world's largest archipelago, is prone to seismic
upheavals due to its location in a series of volcano and earthquake
zones called the Pacific ``Ring of Fire.''
	   A magnitude 5 earthquake can cause considerable damage in
populated areas.

Heat wave doesn't slow Byron Black
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS last graf with Enqvist pulling out for ankle injury. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ A record heat wave failed to cool off former
Southern Cal star Byron Black of Zimbabwe, the seventh seed who
defeated Sjeng Schalken of the Netherlands 6-4, 7-6 (10-8) in
opening play at the dlrs 340,000 Mercedes-Benz Cup men's tennis
tournament.
	   Temperatures over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) on
the courts of the Los Angeles Tennis Center on the UCLA campus.
	   ``This is almost like my second home,'' Black said. ``People
really get into that USC-UCLA thing, but I'm past college now.
Sjeng is a hot and cold player. It comes down to more of a fitness
contest in this heat. I tried to outhustle him at the end.''
	   Schalken had four set points in the second set tiebreaker, but
was unable to capitalize.
	   ``Towards the end, Sjeng played loose, almost as if he didn't
care,'' Black said.
	   Black's brother, Wayne, however, wasn't as fortunate, losing to
Martin Damm of the Czech Republic 2-6, 7-5, 6-0.
	   Wild-card Justin Gimelstob overpowered Daniel Vacek of the Czech
Republic, 6-4, 6-0, and Australian Andrew Ilie downed MaliVai
Washington 6-4, 6-1.
	   In other first-round play, Denmark's Kenneth Carlsen beat Oscar
Burrieza of Spain, 7-5, 6-4, Italian Gianluca Pozzi ousted
Argentina's Guillermo Canas 6-2, 6-4, and Jan-Michael Gambill
topped Steve Campbell 6-4, 6-4.
	   Wimbledon champion Pete Sampras, the world's No. 1 player, was
scheduled to play, but withdrew due to a foot injury. He was
replaced by last year's U.S. Open champion, Australian Patrick
Rafter, as the top seed. Rafter will play Tuesday night, as will
fifth-seeded Andre Agassi.
	   Monday night's featured match was between fourth-seeded Thomas
Enqvist of Sweden and 17-year-old qualifier Taylor Dent of Newport
Beach, California. However, Enqvist pulled out in the early evening
with tendinitis in the right ankle and was replaced by Sandon
Stolle of Australia.

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Florida (AP) _ Wade Boggs hit a two-run homer
and later passed Babe Ruth for 33rd place on the career hits list
as the Tampa Bay Devil Rays beat the Oakland Athletics 11-5 Monday
night.
	   The expansion Devil Rays won their team-record fifth straight
game. Mike Blowers and Miguel Tejada homered for Oakland, which
lost its season-high seventh in a row.
	   Boggs had three hits. He broke an 0-for-14 slump with a single
in the third, homered to highlight a five-run fifth and moved past
Ruth with an RBI single in the eighth. Boggs has 2,874 career hits.
	   Bryan Rekar (1-2) earned his first victory since June 21, 1997.
Blake Stein (4-6) took the loss despite striking out four batters
in the fourth inning.
 &UR; Angels 6, Royals 1 &QC; 
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Tim Salmon, Cecil Fielder and Phil
Nevin homered to lead Anaheim over Kansas City.
	   Anaheim's Garret Anderson extended his career-high hitting

Nomar Garciaparra for the longest string in the American League
this season.

combining with Shigetoshi Hasegawa on a four-hitter. Kansas City
lost for the seventh time in 10 games.

	   CINCINNATI (AP) _ Ozzie Guillen singled home the go-ahead run in
the 10th inning as the Atlanta Braves recovered from a late blown
lead and beat the Cincinnati Reds 3-2 Monday night.
	   Guillen's two-out single off Gabe White, his third of the game,
drove in Curtis Pride from third and left the Braves 2-3 in
extra-inning games this season.
	   Cincinnati absorbed its second consecutive 10-inning loss _ both
by Stan Belinda (4-8) _ and its 10th loss in the last 11 games
overall.
	   Rudy Seanez (2-0) pitched a perfect inning in relief of Tom
Glavine to get the victory, and Kerry Ligtenberg got the final
three outs for his 14th save.
 &UR; Astros 9, Marlins 1 &QC; 
	   In Houston, Jose Lima pitched a six-hitter and Moises Alou had
four hits, including a solo homer and RBI single, to lead the
Houston Astros over the Florida Marlins.
	   Lima (9-6) pitched his second complete game of the season,
striking out six and walking none.
	   Jeff Bagwell and Derek Bell each homered and drove in three runs
for the Astros, who had 14 hits.
	   Brian Meadows (9-8) allowed seven runs and seven hits in four
innings. He left with a strained groin after giving up two
consecutive hits to open the Houston fifth.

Dollar slips, Tokyo stocks higher at midday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midday trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar slipped from its earlier levels at
midday Tuesday as investors adopted a wait-and-see stance ahead the
selection of Japan's next finance minister. Tokyo stocks gained on
bargain-hunting.
	   The dollar bought 142.16 yen at midday, down 0.18 yen from late
Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate of 142.41 yen
overnight.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained
158.69 points, or 1.00 percent, ending the morning session at
16,103.05. On Monday, the average lost 417.53 points, or 2.55
percent.
	   The dollar slipped as players stepped off to the sidelines in
the absence of fresh buying incentives, traders said.
	   Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi _ Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto's expected replacement _ is reportedly having trouble
finding an appropriate finance minister for his new Cabinet, amid
market expectations for aggressive steps to pull Japan out of
recession.
	   Japanese news media said Tuesday that Obuchi had sounded out
former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, 78, to assume the post of
finance minister, but that Miyazawa reportedly was declining
because of his age.
	   Traders said the dollar's retreat was limited, however, because
of concerns over the outlook for Japan's economic and banking
reforms under the new Cabinet.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices rose as players bought
issues on bargain hunting following Monday's decline. But many
investors remained on the sidelines to await the selection of the
Cabinet on Thursday, traders said.
	   Shares in Daiwa Securities were up 33 yen (23 cents) to 619 yen
(dlrs 4.36), while Sumitomo Bank added 11 yen (8 cents) to 1,332
yen (dlrs 9.38) on reports they have agreed to form a joint
investment-banking venture.
	   Japan's main economic newspaper Nihon Keizai reported that
Sumitomo and Daiwa have agreed to spin off their capital market and
corporate-client divisions and combine them into an
investment-banking venture.
	   The two companies were to hold a news conference later Tuesday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.305 percent from Monday's finish of 1.315 percent,
driving its price up to 111.07 yen from 111.00 yen.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Strongman Hun Sen's party claimed a
landslide victory Tuesday in Cambodia's parliamentary elections,
but the opposition called the result a fraud, setting the stage for
more turmoil in the troubled country.
	   Though official results had still not been released, the
Cambodian People's Party claimed it had won 66 seats in the
122-member National Assembly, giving it a commanding majority over
40 seats for Prince Norodom Ranriddh's FUNCINPEC and 16 for the Sam
Rainsy Party.
	   ``We seriously believe there was a counting fraud,'' FUNCINPEC
said in a statement. ``We believe the vote is not free and fair.
Therefore, the election result is not credible. We demand the NEC
to recount ballots in specific polling stations.''
	   Preliminary official results had still not been announced by the
Hun Sen-dominated National Election Committee, which was accused of
colluding in tampering when the scheduled release of the outcome
Monday was postponed a day.
	   The claimed result was much better than estimates announced by
the Committee for Free Elections in Cambodia, the country's top
independent election monitor, that Hun Sen's party had taken 40
percent to 50 percent of the vote.
	   Hun Sen's party claimed to have received 1.8 million votes,
compared to 1.4 million for FUNCINPEC and 583,000 for the Sam
Rainsy Party.
	   But if the results are not accepted by Hun Sen's rivals or the
millions of Cambodians who voted Sunday, the outcome could be more
turmoil for a country that has suffered 30 years of civil war and
the Khmer Rouge genocide of the 1970s.
	   Without waiting for the results, the group coordinating 678
foreign observers from 40 countries declared the process free and
fair Monday, though the campaign had been marked by violence,
including murder, and intimidation by Hun Sen's supporters against
the opposition.
	   The Joint International Observers Group, dominated by the
European Union, the main foreign donor in organizing the elections,
issued a declaration saying ``all parties should accept and honor
the results of the election without any attempt to undermine the
original outcome.''
	   Hun Sen refused to accept defeat in U.N.-sponsored polls in 1993
and forced the winner, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, to accept a
co-premiership or face civil war. A year ago, Hun Sen ended their
tense arrangement by sending tanks into the streets and deposing
Ranariddh in two days of fighting.
	   The international endorsement of the polling and counting
process was an important step toward Hun Sen's goal when he called
the elections and permitted Ranariddh to return from exile to
contest them _ restoration of international legitimacy and aid lost
because of his bloody coup.
	   Opponents had said for months that Hun Sen had rigged the
outcome in his favor. Leaders were harassed with threats of arrest,
access to the all-important broadcast media was denied, opposition
activists were murdered and voters intimidated.
	   At least 90 percent of the 5.4 million registered voters cast
ballots Sunday, showing faith in the democratic process.
	   But U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warned that
process could still unravel.
	   ``The real test of Cambodia's democracy will come after the
ballots are counted,'' she said in Manila, Philippines.
	   Election day was not free of violence. An attack on a military
outpost by die-hard remnants of the Khmer Rouge left 10 people
dead. But more significantly, thousands of former guerrillas who
have made peace over the past two years voted for the first time in
their lives.

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A priest arrested in the murder of a
prominent bishop was ordered held in prison on Monday while
prosecutors collect evidence against him.
	   Investigating Judge Isaias Figueroa Medina issued the order
against the Rev. Mario Orantes Najera, whose arrest last week
shocked the country. He is accused of killing Bishop Juan Gerardi,
though a gag order on those involved in the case has left the
alleged motive a mystery.
	   Also ordered held was Margarita Lopez, a church cook accused of
covering up the slaying.
	   Orantes, 39, reported finding the bishop's bludgeoned corpse on
April 26 at the San Sebastian church, where both lived.
	   Suspicion for the crime had fallen on right-wing death squads
because the killing came two days after Gerardi, head of a church
human rights office, had issued a major report blaming the military
and associated groups for most of the killings in Guatemala's civil
war of 1960-1996.
	   The Archdiocese of Guatemala City said in a Monday press
statement that the church does not oppose the investigations but
``believes in the innocence of Father Mario Orantes Najera.''
	   ``We demand, out of respect for Monsignor Gerardi ... the Church
and the people of Guatemala, that no more distractions be
elaborated to hide the real killers,'' the statement continued.
	   Figueroa's order gives prosecutors as much as three months to
provide evidence to determine whether Orantes should be formally
tried.
	   Also being held in the case is a civilian named Carlos Enrique
Vielman, who was arrested April 30.

Twelve die from tuberculosis at nursing home in northern Japan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KOZO MIZOGUCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Twelve of 27 people who contracted tuberculosis at
a nursing home in northern Japan died over a two-year period ending
early last year, government officials said Tuesday.
	   It was the first mass outbreak of tuberculosis at a nursing home
in Japan, said Kazuhito Watanabe of the Health Promotion division
of the Niigata prefectural, or state, government.
	   Local government officials failed to quickly report the outbreak
to the Health and Welfare Ministry until earlier this month, when
the mass circulation Asahi newspaper approached them.
	   Watanabe said prefectural health officials were too busy dealing
with the tuberculosis infections during the outbreak to promptly
report them to the ministry as required by an ordinance.
	   In April 1995, a female resident in her 80s was the first to be
diagnosed as having contracted tuberculosis at the facility,
Watanabe said.
	   Subsequent medical examinations of all 332 residents and
employees showed that six were infected. The name of the nursing
home was not disclosed, but is located in Niigata prefecture, 256
kilometers (160 miles), northwest of Tokyo,
	   A total of 27 people at the home _ ranging from their 40s
through their 90s and including 22 residents and five employees _
were found to have contracted the disease between early 1995 and
May of 1997.
	   During the period, 12 died of tuberculosis or complications
associated with it, Watanabe said. He said that eight medical exams
of residents and employees were carried out during the period of
the infections.
	   Those who were found to have the disease, including those who
eventually died, were treated, he said.
	   ``We alerted local health officials across the nation to report
any tuberculosis as quickly as possible,'' said Hidejiro Takizawa,
director of the Tuberculosis and Infectious Disease Division with
the Health and Welfare Ministry. The alert was issued Monday after
the Niigata cases came to light, he said.
	   Takizawa said, however, that those cases were rare and that the
ministry was not considering any penalties for the nursing home.
	   ``People now consider tuberculosis a disease of the past,
treating it as just a cold or light pneumonia,'' Takizawa said,
suggesting that both Japanese patients and doctors don't take
initial symptoms seriously enough.
	   About 130,000 people contracted tuberculosis here in 1996, while
3,000 died. That was about the same number of deaths recorded the
previous year, according to government figures.
	   The ratio of contracting tuberculosis in Japan was the highest
among major advanced nations with 35.7 percent per 100,000 people
in 1996, compared with 9.3 percent in the United States, the Health
Ministry said. In Britain, the ratio stood at 10.7 percent; while
in France it was 15.7 percent and in Germany 16.0 percent.

Albright urges Australia to reject isolationism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright Tuesday warned that Australia must reject the isolationist
policies of right-wing populist legislator Pauline Hanson.
	   In an interview scheduled for broadcast on Australian television
on the eve of her visit for annual ministerial consultations,
Albright said an image of tolerance was critical to Australia's
international reputation. She also said isolationism was not an
option for Australia or the United States.
	   ``We both, Australians and Americans, have the privilege of
living in very large land masses, but in both our countries we are
multiethnic societies,'' Albright said, in a partial transcript of
the interview released to news outlets.
	   ``We are both countries of immigrants and I think that as
countries of immigrants even more we ought to understand that we
need to engage with other countries.
	   ``Whether it is just pragmatically in terms of technology or in
terms of trade, in terms of relationships, you can't get anywhere
as an isolationist country.
	   ``Tolerance is an essential aspect in terms of how a country is
viewed internationally,'' Albright said.
	   ``The problems that we have with countries ... where the
problems are the greatest, are where there is no tolerance, and I
think that tolerance has to be the hallmark of how we operate with
each other.''
	   Hanson's One Nation party won almost a quarter of the votes in a
Queensland state election in June and has been scoring double
figures in recent national opinion polls.
	   Hanson claims Australia is becoming ``Asianized,'' opposes
special welfare payments to Aborigines and advocates protectionist
economic policies. Her views have been condemned by both the
conservative government and the Labor opposition.

Eager for dialogue, Indonesia pulls 400 troops out of East Timor

	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Filing up a ramp and into the belly of a
landing craft, 400 Indonesian soldiers left East Timor on Tuesday
in a troop withdrawal that the government hopes will bring peace to
the troubled territory.
	   Clad in camouflage and cradling rifles in their arms, soldiers
in red and green berets stood stiff in a farewell ceremony on the
dock in Dili, the capital of the former Portuguese colony.
	   ``I'm happy to be going home,'' said Samsuri, a soldier from
Jakarta. After several port calls, the grey Indonesian navy boat
will arrive in the Indonesian capital in nine days.
	   On Dili's dock in 1975, Indonesian soldiers shot and killed East
Timorese during an invasion that left tens of thousands dead and
tarnished Indonesia's international image.
	   Several hundred separatist rebels still operate in the hilly
territory of 800,000 people, but the military has reported no
clashes since former President Suharto quit in May.
	   His reform-minded successor, B.J. Habibie, is seeking dialogue
on a solution to the bitter conflict in East Timor, although he
rules out granting a vote on independence.
	   The troop withdrawal was designed to ease tensions and set the
stage for talks. A total of 1,000 soldiers will leave East Timor by
early August, and 11,000 will remain.
	   ``We want to see more go,'' said Filomeno Hornay, dean of
agriculture at the University of East Timor. ``But we have to try
to maintain security ourselves. If there's chaos, it's useless for
them to withdraw. It's a test for East Timor.''
	   Indonesia, which took over East Timor after intervening in a
civil war, has justified its authority there by saying internal
fighting will break out if troops leave.
	   Col. Tono Suratman, East Timor's military commander, said
security was improving in Indonesia's 27th province, but left open
the possibility of bringing troops back.
	   ``It depends on the situation,'' he said. ``We're still hearing
about terrorizing and intimidation against the people.''
	   Earlier this month, thousands of non-East Timorese fled,
complaining of harassment by the indigenous population. The threats
followed pro-independence demonstrations in which Indonesian
soldiers killed two protesters.
	   The troop pullout comes just ahead of an Aug. 4-5 meeting in New
York in which U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the foreign
ministers of Indonesia and Portugal will debate how to end more
than two decades of conflict.
	   Some of the troops who left are members of Kopassus, an elite
unit that has been implicated in the kidnapping of political
activists in Jakarta and other parts of Indonesia earlier this
year. Seven Kopassus troops have been arrested.
	   While the push for dialogue gains momentum, a major sticking
point remains: East Timor's political future.
	   Habibie rules out relinquishing Indonesian control of East
Timor, offering instead an undefined measure of autonomy.
Anti-Indonesian activists demand nothing less than a vote on
independence.
	   As Suratman pinned medals on the chests of the commanding
officers of the departing units, dozens of East Timorese watched
silently, standing on a sidewalk behind an iron fence.
	   ``All the troops have to withdraw from East Timor because they
make trouble,'' said one onlooker, 13-year-old Francisco Sarmento.
``We want a referendum, we want independence.''

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sam Rainsy refusing to accept result, observer
comment. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Strongman Hun Sen's party claimed a
landslide victory Tuesday in Cambodia's parliamentary elections,
but the opposition called the result a fraud, setting the stage for
more turmoil in the troubled country.
	   Though official results had still not been released, the
Cambodian People's Party claimed it had won 66 seats in the
122-member National Assembly, giving it a commanding majority over
40 seats for Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC and 16 for the
Sam Rainsy Party.
	   ``We seriously believe there was a counting fraud,'' FUNCINPEC
said in a statement. ``We believe the vote is not free and fair.
Therefore, the election result is not credible. We demand the NEC
to recount ballots in specific polling stations.''
	   The Hun Sen-dominated National Election Committee was accused of
colluding in alleged overnight tampering with the election results
when they postponed the scheduled release Monday.
	   The Committee for Free and Fair Elections in Cambodia, the
country's top independent election monitor, said its figures showed
that Hun Sen's party had taken 40 percent to 50 percent of the
vote.
	   Hun Sen's party claimed to have received 1.8 million votes,
compared to 1.4 million for FUNCINPEC and 583,000 for the Sam
Rainsy Party. Assembly seats, however, are allotted under a
complicated formula not entirely reflecting the popular vote.
	   The normally talkative Sam Rainsy, asked if he accepted the
claims, said simply ``No.''
	   A joint statement between the two chief opposition parties was
expected later in the day.
	   But if the results are not accepted by Hun Sen's rivals or the
millions of Cambodians who voted Sunday the outcome could be more
turmoil for a country that has suffered 30 years of civil war and
the Khmer Rouge genocide of the 1970s.
	   Without waiting for the results, the group coordinating 678
foreign observers from 40 countries declared the process free and
fair Monday, though the campaign had been marked by violence,
including murder, and intimidation by Hun Sen's supporters against
the opposition.
	   The Joint International Observers Group, dominated by the
European Union, the main foreign donor in organizing the elections,
issued a declaration saying ``all parties should accept and honor
the results of the election without any attempt to undermine the
original outcome.''
	   Hun Sen refused to accept defeat in U.N.-sponsored polls in 1993
and forced the winner, Ranariddh, to accept a co-premiership or
face civil war. A year ago, Hun Sen ended their tense arrangement
by sending tanks into the streets and deposing Ranariddh in two
days of fighting.
	   The international endorsement was an important step toward Hun
Sen's goal _ restoration of international legitimacy and aid lost
because of his bloody coup _ when he called the elections and
permitted Ranariddh to return from exile to run.
	   Opponents said for months that Hun Sen had rigged the outcome.
Leaders were harassed with threats of arrest, access to the
all-important broadcast media was denied, opposition activists were
murdered and voters intimidated.
	   The United States, which said the violence flawed the process
from the outset, has indicated it will issue a separate judgment.
	   Former Australian Ambassador Tony Kevin, who has accused
Washington of anti-Hun Sen bias, created an independent observation
group that Tuesday ``urged all governments that claim to have the
best interests of Cambodia at heart'' to accept the election
results and resume aid.
	   At least 90 percent of the 5.4 million registered voters cast
ballots Sunday, showing faith in the democratic process.
	   But U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warned that
process could still unravel.
	   ``The real test of Cambodia's democracy will come after the
ballots are counted,'' she said in Manila, Philippines.
	   Election day was not free of violence. An attack on a military
outpost by die-hard remnants of the Khmer Rouge left 10 people
dead. But more significantly, thousands of former guerrillas who
have made peace over the past two years voted for the first time in
their lives.
