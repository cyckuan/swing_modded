GUNMAN FATALLY SHOOTS 7 AT CHURCH BEFORE KILLING HIMSELF

   HOUSTON _ A man with a semiautomatic handgun walked into a
Baptist church in Fort Worth early Wednesday evening and began
firing during a special service for teen-agers who had just stopped
singing hymns and had begun to pray.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, local police officers arrived at the church and
the man turned the gun on himself, the police said. Six people
attending the church service were killed in addition to the gunman,
local authorities said. An eighth person died later at a hospital,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. David Ellis of the Fort Worth Police Department said three
teen-agers and three adults were shot to death inside the church in
the city's southwest corner. Ellis also said a pipe bomb exploded
on a balcony inside the church sanctuary after the 7 p.m. shooting.
The bomb squad was inspecting several suspicious packages found at
the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's cartridges, shrapnel and empty cart boxes and blood
splattered all over the wall,'' Ellis was quoted by The Fort Worth
Star-Telegram as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth Acting Police Chief Ralph Mendoza described the
gunman as a white male in his 20s or 30s but offered no other
information. He said the man had fired a semiautomatic handgun, and
officers had found at least three spent ammunition clips on the
floor of the sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was surprised the shooting had occurred inside a
church, Fort Worth Fire Chief Larry McMillen responded, ``I'm at
the point where nothing surprises me.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 8 p.m., police officers told reporters and
bystanders to get inside an elementary school across the street
from the church because of the explosives. A Fort Worth Fire
Department spokesman, Tony Rodriguez, said eight people had been
taken to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   A supervisor with the Fort Worth Police Department. S. Coe, said
officers evacuated the church, Wedgwood Baptist, and a bomb squad
swept the sanctuary for other explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Coe said the gunman arrived at the church shortly before 7 p.m.
and began firing. An estimated 150 teen-agers were attending the
weekly service for the annual ``See You at the Pole'' gathering,
where students affirm their faith and concern for the problems of
society by holding prayer time around their school's flagpole.
</P>
<P>
   A young man interviewed on CNN said the gunman paused at least
once to reload his gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just saw him keep shooting and reloading,'' said the man,
who was not identified. ``He'd empty it and then throw some more
bullets in there and he kept shooting. I seen him sit down, he kept
walking back and forth in the very back aisle, and he kept shooting
straight. I was at the side between the door and the window and he
looked like he looked at me, so I got down and he started
shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Dickens, 14, told the Fort Worth newspaper, ``We had
just finished singing and we were praying when he came in,''
Dickens said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was a joke,'' Dickens said. ``We were singing
and he told us to shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on MSNBC, a man who was in the church said that
``all of a sudden we heard some bang noises.'' He went on to say
that a man then ``kind of fell across the doorway and said he had
been shot.''
</P>
<P>
   A teen-ager interviewed on CNN said: ``We were on stage playing.
We heard pops. We thought they were toys or something. A guy
started screaming in the back of the auditorium. And we seen him
load his gun so we just dove and ran out the building.''
</P>
<P>
   Another youth who was in the church described the gunman as
looking like the Unabomer, add that at first he ``thought it was a
joke.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``See You at the Pole'' service is celebrated at churches
across Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was the day youth in America gather around the flagpole
at their school and pray for their school,'' said Mark Collins, a
Baptist minister in Houston. He said the practice started about
five years ago, he believes with a youth group in a small Texas
town.

THANKS TO AGBAYANI, METS COMPLETE SUCCESSFUL TRIP WITH WIN OVER
ROCKIES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The New York Mets were sliding like a car with a driver
who had slammed on the brakes too hard, spinning toward a second
straight loss to the Colorado Rockies that would send them home
from this road trip with some unflattering skid marks.
</P>
<P>
   Their offense had looked sleepy in the final days of this trip,
as if the players were weary from playing 13 consecutive games.
Their starting pitching had buoyed them through their last two
series on the West Coast this season. But when that sputtered
Wednesday _ and then the bullpen stalled, too _ the Mets were
careening toward a disappointing end to what had been a successful
trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets needed saving as much as Benny Agbayani needed to
salvage his own season, and he came through Wednesday, in the Mets'
10-5 victory over Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Agbayani, a part-time outfielder, who had hit 10 homers in his
first 73 at-bats only to wait 160 more at-bats for his next one,
hit a two-run homer in the sixth inning to give the Mets a 5-4
lead. After the Rockies rallied to tie the score, and Darryl
Hamilton hit a pinch-hit triple to drive in Robin Ventura to give
the Mets a 6-5 lead, Agbayani hit a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   That provided the Mets with all the cushion needed by a shaky
John Franco (who loaded the bases in the eighth) and Armando
Benitez (who got out of that jam) until the offense finally
unleashed a week's worth of pent-up hits for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets finished the punishing road trip at 5-2. They trailed
Atlanta by 1 1-2 games in the National League East but were still
three games ahead of Cincinnati in the wild-card race pending
results of Wednesday night's games.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the late-game flurry of hits that ballooned the lead,
the Mets seemed to drag toward home as if they had blown a tire.
Although they scored three runs in the first two innings, their
starting pitcher, Orel Hershiser, struggled early, too. He was
removed after allowing four runs on six hits and four walks in six
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Cook came in to pitch the seventh, and Kurt Abbott hit a
double down the left-field line, which sent chalk flying in the air
and manager Bobby Valentine racing onto the field for a few minutes
of heated argument with the umpires. Cook got Larry Walker, the
league's leading hitter, to pop up on the first pitch, but then he
walked Todd Helton on a 3-1 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   That brought Turk Wendell (5-4) from the bullpen to face Vinny
Castilla. Castilla entered the game batting .212 against
right-handers _ as Wendell is. Castilla smacked a single to left
field that scored Abbott to tie the score at 5-5.
</P>
<P>
   But then Agbayani stepped on the accelerator and steadied the
Mets again. He had had an extraordinary burst after the Mets
brought him up from Triple-A. But since June 25, the date of his
last home run, Agbayani needed 182 at-bats to get his next two.
</P>
<P>
   After he got his 12th in the sixth inning Wednesday, he struck
again. Ventura had walked and Hamilton _ a former Rockie, who
pinch-hit for Shawon Dunston _ slammed a triple to right field that
Walker dived for but missed. As the ball skittered to the wall,
Ventura scored to give the Mets the lead and Hamilton went to
third. Agbayani's sacrifice fly scored Hamilton to give the Mets a
7-5 lead.
</P>
<P>
   That the Mets needed Agbayani's infrequent burst of power is not
surprising. Starting pitching had all but dragged the Mets through
this road trip. Entering the game, except for Roger Cedeno and Mike
Piazza, the other six Mets everyday players were hitting .169 on
this trip. But Wednesday, the Mets got going quickly against
Colorado's Brian Bohanon, scoring three runs on a walk and three
doubles in the first two innings.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockies got to Hershiser, too, and they led by 4-3 to
create the perfect scenario for Agbayani. His season began as a
fairy tale: the 30th-round draft pick who had toiled for six years
in the netherworld of the minor leagues. But Agbayani had been an
all-state wide receiver in high school in Hawaii, and he had become
a favorite of Valentine's when Valentine managed him at Triple-A
Norfolk in 1996.

   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Having already produced the greatest
evacuation in U.S. history, Hurricane Floyd skirted Florida and
Georgia on Wednesday and aimed itself directly at the low-lying
coastal border between the Carolinas, where its eye was expected to
come ashore early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Although no widespread damage from hurricane force winds or
waves was yet reported on the East Coast, gusts up to 79 mph began
knocking down power lines and blowing billboards across roadways on
Wednesday evening along the South Carolina coast. And with
sustained winds of more than 40 mph, falling trees began smashing
windows and roofs at several houses northeast of Charleston,
according to the police. At least 200,000 residents were without
power in the Charleston region, and repair crews had no plans to
begin work until the storm passed.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, the homes of those residents were empty,
as were all others in dozens of counties from Jacksonville, Fla.,
to Wilmington, N.C. Evacuation orders were in effect on Wednesday
for 2.6 million people, and with the majority of those residents
obeying the orders, federal emergency officials said the evacuation
had now become the nation's largest.
</P>
<P>
   About 65 percent of Charleston's 87,000 residents had moved
inland, and Charleston County officials were amazed to report an 80
percent evacuation rate for the 230,000 people in the rest of the
county. The rate was far higher than for any previous hurricane,
and was attributed to the storm's enormous size and power, which by
evening appeared likely to spare the city. More than 90 percent of
neighboring Beaufort County was empty, according to county
officials, and 6,300 people were reported to be in shelters in a
three-county area.
</P>
<P>
   With the storm's eye moving to the north and east, residents of
North Carolina began adding to the exodus on Wednesday, filling up
hotels as far away as Alabama and Tennessee. The state government
ordered evacuations from the barrier islands around Wilmington, and
traffic began to clog the area just as heavy rains began falling at
midday. President Clinton declared coastal areas in the Carolinas
to be disaster areas, adding them to list of counties in Florida
and Georgia that were earlier made eligible for federal funds and
relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that Florida and Georgia at this point feel like
they've dodged a real bullet,'' said Richard Moore, the public
safety secretary for North Carolina. ``This thing is not going to
miss us.''
</P>
<P>
   The storm disrupted travel along the East Coast, as the Federal
Aviation Administration shut down control tower operations on
Wednesday at airports in Wilmington, N.C., Charleston, S.C., Myrtle
Beach, S.C, West Palm Beach, Fla., Daytona Beach, Fla. and
Jacksonville, Fla. Some airlines canceled flights as far away from
the storm as Richmond and Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, more than 80 Navy ships with an estimated 30,000
sailors, including three aircraft carriers, took to sea on
Wednesday from the Norfolk Naval Base to escape the storm. The
exodus took all day. Also 180 Navy and Air Force planes flew to
inland bases from the Oceana Naval Air Station in Virginia Beach
and Langley Air Force Base in Hampton, Va., to inland bases.
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation numbers were particularly high given the extreme
difficulty many residents had in leaving their homes on Tuesday,
because of massive congestion. South Carolina waited until
nightfall to make all lanes of the main interstate highway
westbound away from Charleston. Joseph P. Riley Jr., the mayor of
Charleston, charged the state with ``staggering incompetence,'' and
expressed concern that many of those who tried to leave wound up
returning, putting themselves in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Although Florida was spared the heaviest winds of the hurricane,
which weakened on Wednesday to 115 mph as the storm moved north,
areas around Daytona and Titusville reported numerous damaged roofs
and power lines. About 290,000 customers remained without
electrical power as many of the 1.3 million residents who followed
evacuation orders began returning to their homes. A popular pier in
Daytona collapsed when it was inundated by waves, but the state
insurance commissioner's office said there was no major damage
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   A 150-foot tugboat with eight crew members sank early Wednesday
345 miles off of Jacksonville. The Coast Guard said that
helicopters from the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy rescued all
eight crew members.
</P>
<P>
   The track of the storm left open the possibility that Floyd's
heavy winds and rain could continue north past the Carolinas into
Washington, D.C., New York City and even New England by the
weekend, even if it is not a hurricane at that point. Hurricane
force winds could reach the Chesapeake Bay by Thursday morning, and
federal emergency officials predicted significant tree damage in
Washington because of recent heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency told governors on
Wednesday afternoon that flooding as far north as New England
remains a high possibility through the rest of the week. Because so
much of the mid-Atlantic region is already saturated from Hurricane
Dennis, state agencies remain on high alert for inland river
flooding.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Already, an enormous swath of the country's East Coast was
virtually barren of visible human life. Charleston's historic
downtown was boarded up and deserted, the only movement the ominous
sway of trees and light poles. By 2 p.m., county police officers
had parked their cruisers and gone to shelters, and ambulances
stopped responding to any calls other than cardiac emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   In Horry County, which includes Myrtle Beach, officials reported
substantial flooding several hours before the center of the storm
passed offshore. Paul Whitten, the county's director of emergency
preparedness, said 11.5 inches of rain had accumulated in two days.
County officials were concerned that the worst of the storm was
expected to pass Myrtle Beach at the peak of high tide, at about
12:15 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The resort of Myrtle Beach had become an empty stage set of
abandoned hotels, seafood restaurants, waterslides and miniature
golf courses on Wednesday afternoon as the storm began to produce
significant swells in the Atlantic. Roads were empty and gas
stations, grocery stores and diners were boarded up and locked. One
facade of an old downtown building tumbled to the ground, and
police officers struggled to secure the exterior with plywood.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The usually animated beach town, a popular golf and retirement
destination, was projected to be very near the direct path of the
hurricane during the night, and though the storm's winds had
weakened to 115 mph from 140 mph the day before, officials were
still very worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be in the path of some of the strongest winds and
largest storm surges,'' said Cheryl J. Henry, a county spokeswoman.
A curfew went into effect at 3 p.m., and similar restrictions were
imposed on Charleston after dark.
</P>
<P>
   Further north, in Wilmington, which has been affected by 16
hurricanes in the last decade, officials began preparing for the
serious flooding that occurred in storms such as Bertha, Bonnie and
Fran. Life jackets were placed on all fire trucks to assist in
water rescues. Having just gone through a weeklong pounding from
Hurricane Dennis, North Carolina officials predicted ruinous beach
erosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to damage this beach like we have not seen since
Hazel,'' said Michael Stokes, a spokesman for Wrightsville Beach,
referring to the 1954 storm.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that it has been only a decade since Hurricane Hugo
came ashore in downtown Charleston, killing 13 people, producing a
17-foot surge, and costing South Carolina more than $6 billion,
city officials said they were amazed the state did not have a more
effective evacuation plan for the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Riley and other regional mayors were furious that the Department
of Transportation did not immediately allow fleeing residents to
use all lanes of I-26, as Georgia officials did with I-16 out of
Savannah. Some Charleston residents were on the road for 10 or 12
hours just to reach other parts of the small state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't rocket science,'' Riley said in an interview. ``What
the state Department of Transportation should have had in place and
could easily do is a system where you close lanes of traffic on one
part of the major highways and let people go out, because when you
have a major evacuation from a hurricane and you're requiring
people to leave, then that of a necessity means that people are not
coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jim Hodges, who was blamed by most angry radio-show callers
for the snail's pace of the evacuation, said his transportation
advisers questioned the safety of reversing lanes on the
interstate, but said he finally overruled them at about 8 p.m.
Tuesday. Nonetheless, the issue was likely to remain a political
blow for him _ one handmade sign on a I-26 overpass read, ``Flog
Hodges.''

SHOOTINGS LINK FORT WORTH AND COLUMBINE

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Littleton. Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Two cities became linked through tragedy last night after a
gunman burst into the Wedgwood Baptist Church in southwest Fort
Worth and opened fire Wednesday night, killing more than a
half-dozen people who had gathered for a prayer service.
</P>
<P>
   While Fort Worth residents began to grapple with the shock,
wounds were ripped open anew in Colorado, where parents who lost
their children during April's Columbine High School shooting tried
to understand how a similar tragedy could happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what would be in the heart of this person to make
him start shooting in a church,'' said Beth Nimmo, whose daughter
Rachel Scott was one of the 12 students killed at Columbine.
``There's no safe place anymore; the school wasn't safe; the church
wasn't safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Nimmo, who watched the Wedgwood shooting unfold on television,
said her heart ``ached'' for the victims' families. About half the
Fort Worth victims were teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time stops. Anytime something like that happens, the world
just stops,'' Nimmo said. ``There isn't anything to do that has any
semblance of normalcy _ you just have to find a new way to get
through the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Nimmo, who said that losing her daughter strengthened her trust
in God, encouraged parents who lost their children at Wedgwood
Baptist Church to hold on to their faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it sounds crazy, but it is your faith in the Lord that
is going to see you through this,'' Nimmo said.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor Bruce Porter, who conducted Rachel Scott's funeral, also
expressed disbelief at Wednesday night's events and said that he
hopes that people will continue to turn to God in times of sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a saying among Christians that the blood of martyrs
are the seeds of the church,'' said Porter, who is the senior
pastor at Littleton's non-denominational Celebration Church. ``But
I like to say the blood of the martyrs is actually the rocket fuel
of the church.''
</P>
<P>
   The town of Littleton is grieving for Fort Worth, Porter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our community here is going to be deeply in prayer for the
families there,'' Porter said. ``We know what they are going
through.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been brought to tears _ just experiencing all of this
all over again.''

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _Fort Worth School Superintendent Thomas Tocco
has ordered Bruce Shulkey Elementary School closed Thursday because
of its proximity to Wedgwood Baptist Church, where investigators
continue probing why a gunman would turn a church sanctuary into a
killing field.
</P>
<P>
   Classes have not not been canceled elsewhere, and crisis teams
have been deployed to assist school leaders and teachers help
students cope with the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Police and city leaders said there will be a lot of activity at
Wedgwood Baptist, which is located at 5522 Whitman Ave. In
addition, there were unconfirmed reports of possible bomb devices
used in the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is too much going on in this area, and we do not want
these young children around for obvious reasons,'' Tocco said of
the students at Bruce Shulky.
</P>
<P>
   Parents are being urged not to take their students to the
elementary school, which is across the street from the church, at
5533 Whitman Avenue. Instead, parents who are unable to provide
accommodations for their young children are being asked to take
them to one of three neighboring schools.
</P>
<P>
   School buses will be running as scheduled, Tocco said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly a tragic situation,'' Tocco said Wednesday
night. ``I think one teacher may have been killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Tocco said: ``We have gotten school counselors and psychologists
together and they will be available to help students try and
understand how to make sense of any of this.''
</P>
<P>
   A hot line has been established to assist parents. The number is
(817) 370-5850. Tocco asked parents to be patient.

<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Hall of Fame promoters Bob Arum and Don King have
forged an uneasy truce for Saturday night's ``Fight of the
Millennium'' between undefeated welterweight champions Oscar De La
Hoya and Felix ``Tito'' Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   But the truce got trashed during the final prefight news
conference at the Paris Hotel yesterday. King _ who is Trinidad's
promoter _ challenged Arum _ who is De La Hoya's promoter _ to a
one-on-one $1 million bet on the outcome of the scheduled
12-rounder.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a treasure that many of you don't know about,'' King
said as he introduced Trinidad, the International Boxing Federation
champion from Cupey, Puerto Rico. ``This man is the greatest
fighter, pound-for-pound, in the world. I'm so exuberant about
\Rhim\S that I'm about to put up $1 million of my own money _ if
Bob Arum will accept it _ I will bet $1 million that he will win
this fight.''

<P>
   King's offer to Arum capped a series of long-winded
presentations by Team Trinidad, highlighted by victory predictions
delivered by the fighter, his father/trainer, Felix Trinidad Sr.,
and King.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe!'' King bellowed after Trinidad concluded his
remarks with the promise of a victory and a party that will leave
Puerto Rico hung over until Y2K. ``That is why I want to bet $1
million. I believe I want to put my money where my mouth is. Yeah,
I want to stand up and be accounted for. It won't be long.''
</P>
<P>
   When a grinning King fired that salvo and sat down, Arum strode
to the podium and announced, ``Thank God we're finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I want to say something from the bottom of my heart. Don
King challenged me to a bet of $1 million. I think it's totally
inappropriate for promoters or managers to bet on fighters. In 35
years in this business, I have never, ever bet on a boxing match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don, don't you understand that in putting Felix in the ring
with Oscar De La Hoya you're risking a lot more than $1 million?''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, (31-0, 25 KOs), and the reigning World Boxing
Council champion from East Los Angeles, Calif., has been forced to
carry TVKO's pay-per-view promotion on two fronts. Trinidad (35-0,
30 KOs) does not speak much English, and he has been training in
virtual secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing was insulting,'' Arum said after Trinidad and
his entourage exited the news conference. ``When he should be
talking to the press, he's out of here. These people have no
respect for anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don King is fiasco. But I don't blame King for this. It's the
fault of the Trinidad people. Who the hell do they think they are?
They haven't cooperated in the promotion. They don't talk to
writers. That's why nobody in this country knows who Felix Trinidad
is. But Oscar De La Hoya is going to teach them on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trinidad is not going to be around to see the fifth round.
That's my prediction.'' Trinidad Sr. OKs judges Felix Trinidad Sr.
has put his stamp of approval on the officials assigned by Marc
Ratner, executive director of the Nevada State Athletic Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Halpern of Las Vegas will referee the bout at the sold-out
Mandalay Bay Events Center. The judges will be Jerry Roth of Las
Vegas, Glen Hamada of Tacoma, Wash., and Bob Logist of Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this fight was signed, we were a bit worried about the
judges,'' said the elder Trinidad, whose remarks were translated by
Pepe Ramos. ``But I got to meet Marc Ratner, a very professional
and honest person.'' Last words ``All I can say about this fight is
that if it was a talking contest, we'd lose.''
</P>

POLICE USE EMERGENCY PLAN DEVELOPED AFTER COLUMBINE SHOOTINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KATHY SANDERS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The call that would report what is believed
to be the worst mass killing in Fort Worth's history brought into
action a plan that Fort Worth police developed but never expected
to need.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 7 o'clock Wednesday night, they needed it.
</P>
<P>
   The calls to 911 reported that ``shots have been fired'' in a
church and that several people had been hit. One of the callers was
an off-duty Fort Worth police officer, so dispatchers knew they had
a legitimate report and sent several squad cars to the area.
</P>
<P>
   The Fire Department also was notified.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses had reported hearing an explosion in the church, so
the Fort Worth bomb squad was dispatched.
</P>
<P>
   About 9:30, members of the Fort Worth Tactical Unit arrived to
conduct a search of the grounds to ensure no other explosives or
suspects were in the church.
</P>
<P>
   The entire area was secured, with media and onlookers moved back
three blocks from the church for their own protection, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The department's homicide and major case units will conduct the
investigation into what happened.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, patrol officers lined survivors and witnesses in
the nearby school hallway to begin taking statements. That was
expected to last throughout the night.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, all police clerical personnel were called in to work,
to transcribe statements and other reports.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials were unchacteristically uncooperative with the
news media and declined to talk with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The department's plan for such events was refined and updated
after the killings at Columbine High School near Littleton, Colo.
Police also worked with the school district, taking aerial
photographs at school in case of a similiar occurance in Fort
Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday night, the plan had never been used. And a plan
on paper never completely fits the situation, so there were a few
to-be-expected glitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a unique situation,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, all appropriate police units _ homicide and
major case in particular _ are notified, as are the deputy chief
and Acting Chief Ralph Mendoza. City leaders also are notified, as
was Fort Worth School Supt. Thomas Tocco.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting is believed to be the worst in Fort Worth since
three children were killed at Les Jardins Apartments on the city's
south side.
</P>
<P>
   The children's mother, a Fort Worth police officer, and two
other adults were injured in the shootings, which occurred early on
a Sunday morning in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
   John Wheat, who was said to have been enraged that he had been
accused of molesting one of the children, a 6-year-old girl, was
convicted and sentenced to death in the shootings.

SYDNEY WAY AHEAD OF ATLANTA'S OLYMPIC PACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To some, the Atlanta Summer Olympic Games will be forever
remembered for their wandering buses, their velvet Elvises being
hawked on the city streets and, most soberingly, for the night the
bomb went off in Centennial Olympic Park.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney, in other words, does not have a hard act to follow.
</P>
<P>
   While Atlanta was being strafed in newspapers around the world,
Sydney organizers were taking notes.
</P>
<P>
   As Michael Knight, Australia's Minister of Olympics, told
reporters last week, ``No other Olympic city has completed their
sports facilities as early as Sydney.''
</P>
<P>
   So let the countdown begin.
</P>
<P>
   One year from now, the athletes of the world will begin
competition at the Games of the 27th Olympiad. A record number of
events, 292, will take place in a record number of sports, 28, one
of which will ``not'' be ballroom dancing.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be, for the first time in an Olympics, the
triathlon, a test of endurance in swimming, cycling and running.
The spectacle of 100 goggles-clad triathletes, charging into the
Sydney Harbor from the steps of the city's famed Opera House,
should be one of the enduring images of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   A year before its Olympics, Atlanta was progressing like the
afternoon commute on Interstate 75. It wasn't ready, but it was
getting there. Centennial Olympic Park, nudged into the middle of
downtown, was still a canyon of bulldozers and red dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney's centerpiece Olympic Stadium, on the other hand, has
been open for seven months. A rugby match in the stadium recently
drew 107,042 spectators, with the local newspapers reporting that
trains and buses experienced only minimal delays.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Hollway, the head of the Sydney Organizing Committee for
the Olympic Games (SOCOG), has warned his people not to be too
overconfident, however.
</P>
<P>
   Hollway has designated Sept. 26 as Super Sunday, when the Sydney
logistical and technological systems will be tested to the max.
Simultaneous competitions will be held in field hockey, archery,
water polo _ 10 sports in all, from athletes representing 50
nations _ and results, both real and scripted, will be reported
from 21 Olympic venue sites.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, as Hollway and his crew learned, the results
gathering system melted down on Day One. Again, Sydney observed and
learned.
</P>
<P>
   The Australians had beaten stiff competition from Beijing,
Berlin and Manchester, England, to win the International Olympic
Committee's nod in September 1993. They did it with skillful
politicking, centered around an ecology theme.
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney bid team produced a video for IOC members that
featured appearances by Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. Both extolled
the environment-friendly aspects of the Sydney bid. Kidman remarked
how she would love to see the Games go to the city where she grew
up.
</P>
<P>
   What the video neglected to mention was that Homebush Bay, site
of the new Olympic Park, was once the home to a Union Carbide plant
and for years had been a dumping ground for toxic wastes. Fishing
on the bay was banned in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, after they had won the Olympic bid, Sydney officials
suddenly stopped boasting about the bay's adjoining waters. SOCOG
spent $85 million to clean up the Olympic Park site, gathering 400
tons of old wastes and encasing them in a clay-and-dirt procedure
that was endorsed by the environmental activists at Greenpeace.
</P>
<P>
   You still can't fish in Homebush Bay. But in 12 months, grassy
knolls and gleaming new sports facilities will greet an estimated
350,000 visitors daily at the Olympic Park.
</P>
<P>
   It has not all been a smooth ride, however. The Salt Lake City
Olympic scandal reached across the seas and touched Phil Coles,
once Australia's most influential IOC member. Coles was twice
censured by the IOC for accepting excessive favors from Salt Lake
bid officials and for distributing a ``secret dossier'' on IOC
members.
</P>
<P>
   The publicity surrounding Coles and Salt Lake City has made it
difficult for SOCOG to meet its announced revenue projections of
$1.65 billion. News reports in Sydney have estimated that the
shortfall will be anywhere from $32 million to $90 million.
</P>
<P>
   But Hollway has promised there will be no mass sale of civic
sidewalk space, like visitors saw in vendor-cluttered Atlanta. One
of his first changes was to open some of the venue seating areas,
previously reserved for sponsors, and sell the seats to the general
public.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the most conspicuous changes from Atlanta figures
to stem from the fact that the Sydney Olympics are backed by the
state government of New South Wales. Atlanta prided itself on being
funded privately, using corporate contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Hollway and SOCOG boldly have promised to bring home a $19.4
million surplus to the government when it's all over.
</P>
<P>
   Controversies have been relatively few in Sydney as the Games
draw nearer. A flap involving a marching band with ``too many
Americans'' for the opening ceremonies was resolved by adding
marchers from 20 more foreign countries. The Australian field
hockey coach complained that the turf was too bouncy; it will be
fixed.
</P>
<P>
   By the inevitable comparisons, the world is probably going to
love Sydney as host of the 2000 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Let the countdown begin.

SHOOTINGS LINK FORT WORTH AND COLUMBINE
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Littleton. Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Two cities became linked through tragedy last night after a
gunman burst into the Wedgwood Baptist Church in southwest Fort
Worth and opened fire Wednesday night, killing more than a
half-dozen people who had gathered for a prayer service.
</P>
<P>
   While Fort Worth residents began to grapple with the shock,
wounds were ripped open anew in Colorado, where parents who lost
their children during April's Columbine High School shooting tried
to understand how a similar tragedy could happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what would be in the heart of this person to make
him start shooting in a church,'' said Beth Nimmo, whose daughter
Rachel Scott was one of the 12 students killed at Columbine.
``There's no safe place anymore; the school wasn't safe; the church
wasn't safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Nimmo, who watched the Wedgwood shooting unfold on television,
said her heart ``ached'' for the victims' families. About half the
Fort Worth victims were teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time stops. Anytime something like that happens, the world
just stops,'' Nimmo said. ``There isn't anything to do that has any
semblance of normalcy _ you just have to find a new way to get
through the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Nimmo, who said that losing her daughter strengthened her trust
in God, encouraged parents who lost their children at Wedgwood
Baptist Church to hold on to their faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it sounds crazy, but it is your faith in the Lord that
is going to see you through this,'' Nimmo said.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor Bruce Porter, who conducted Rachel Scott's funeral, also
expressed disbelief at Wednesday night's events and said that he
hopes that people will continue to turn to God in times of sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a saying among Christians that the blood of martyrs
are the seeds of the church,'' said Porter, who is the senior
pastor at Littleton's non-denominational Celebration Church. ``But
I like to say the blood of the martyrs is actually the rocket fuel
of the church.''
</P>
<P>
   The town of Littleton is grieving for Fort Worth, Porter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our community here is going to be deeply in prayer for the
families there,'' Porter said. ``We know what they are going
through.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been brought to tears _ just experiencing all of this
all over again.''

COWBOYS' BIG THREE SHOW THEIR SENIOR SPIRIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ If the Cowboys proved anything in five quarters
against Washington, they proved that the Big Three of Troy Aikman,
Emmitt Smith and Michael Irvin haven't gone soft on emotion after
33 seasons, 485 games and several lifetimes together in Sunday's
game alone.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly four-hour marathon with a surprise ending that
included a franchise-tying 21-point, fourth-quarter comeback and a
spectacular Rocket launch in overtime, gave Chan Gailey a little of
everything, not to be confused with a little of everything that the
second-year Cowboys coach heard, or chose not to hear, on the
sideline during the course of the game.
</P>
<P>
   You might say that the seniority leaders haven't lost their
larynxes.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was loud and clear about running the ball when Gailey had
other notions during the Cowboys' black-hole period, otherwise
known as the middle quarters. During those two quarters, both
scoreless for Dallas, Smith carried the ball only seven times.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin felt competitively challenged _ OK, he was livid _ because
he was forced to watch most of the third quarter from the sideline
at Gailey's request. You know Chan's Plan by now: Rest Irvin. Keep
him fresh, both for at the end of games and at the end of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, who until now always has been blamed for either lacking
emotion or unloading ill-tempered emotion on some unsuspecting
receiver who made a ``faux pas'', used Sunday's game to create
actions that speak volumes. He had a career-high five touchdown
passes, plus three interceptions, 362 yards passing, and a
fourth-quarter/OT performance that may end up helping getting his
old buddy Norv Turner, the Redskins coach, fired sooner rather than
later.
</P>
<P>
   But first, mind-speakers first. Smith knows there has been much
discussion since Sunday about his telling Gailey, with the Cowboys
21 points behind, that the run was there against the Redskins, so
please don't abandon it.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what Smith had to say yesterday:
</P>
<P>
   ``If we just sat on our hands on the sideline and weren't
emotional about what was going on, people would have the perception
that we really didn't care. If we show emotion and speak up, people
say we're \Rdisgruntled\S. We're in a Catch-22.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those folks, I say sit on your behinds and just do what
you've been doing best, which is ``nothing''. Let us go and do our
job the best way we can. If you think you can do better, then come
out here and work with us for a week. Go through what we go
through. Be what we are. Do what we do. Then go on the field and
try sitting on your hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RPlayers have\S spent the whole off-season trying hard for
this particular moment. Now you get into the middle of a very
heated game, you're behind by 21, you've got to have emotion.
Emotion drives you to come back and push it into overtime ... and
pull it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, I knew that if we stayed behind like that, the
running game would be totally abandoned. I was afraid of that
occurring, considering how well we were running the ball at the
time. Chan is the head coach. It got it under control. It all
worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it did. The first touchdown of the comeback was a 1-yard
run on a toss play, with Smith following Daryl Johnston into the
end zone. Smith went on to rush for 31 yards in the fourth quarter
before it was turned over to the passing game in OT.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin said the message Smith laid on Gailey's ears was nothing
compared with the message Smith's action delivered to the young
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look at Emmitt and say to themselves, `After all he has
accomplished ... and he's doing that, let me get my butt in gear.'
That's good for our young guys to see from the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, when a man speaks, people let the vocal part
override his actions. Emmitt spoke Sunday, but it was emotion
boiling up. This game still means this much to him. He wanted to
make a play. I don't see anything wrong with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman keeps his emotions in check more than Irvin and Smith,
but then he's the one directing the offense, reading the defenses,
checking off at the line of scrimmage as he did on the second of
his two touchdown passes to tight end David LaFleur in the first 16
minutes of the game Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   How does he feels about Irvin and Smith's being left out of the
mix any time in a game? Aikman had an opinion yesterday:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the positives are that these guys get rested a little
bit ... and the negatives are that they're not out there on the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little biased in my response because I've played with
those guys in some big games. I know there are some new people
within the club who haven't been around and have not seen these
guys make big plays in big games. I have the luxury of being able
to reflect on those times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see them on the field all the time, but I know the
coaches have to make those decisions as to what they feel is best.
I think everyone involved has done a nice job of accepting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said he simply didn't hear or notice Irvin sulking.
Conversely, Gailey accepted Smith's plea to run the ball against
the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Said Gailey, ``I heard ``that''!''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody can say the Cowboys' Big Three are afraid to lay out
their emotions, voice their opinions or put their convictions on
parade.

DEJA VU ALL OVER AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The parallels are striking.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen years ago, two remarkable welterweights _ Sugar Ray
Leonard and Tommy Hearns _ met here in one of the most important
lower-weight fights of all time. One was a good looking,
charismatic Olympic gold medal winner, the other a tall, fearsome
knockout artist who seemed to be unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, it seems history will repeat itself _ only with the
names Oscar De La Hoya and Felix Trinidad on the marquee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost eerie in terms of their styles,'' boxing
television analyst Larry Merchant said.
</P>
<P>
   However, does Saturday's energy-packed matchup truly rival the
unforgettable 1981 bout or other bouts in an era graced with the
once-in-a-lifetime foursome of Leonard, Hearns, Roberto Duran and
Marvin Hagler?
</P>
<P>
   Yes and no.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, in terms of its place in boxing history and the record
amount of money it will generate. De La Hoya and Trinidad are two
of the three-or-four best fighters in the world and will be paid
handsomely because of it.
</P>
<P>
   No, in terms of impact on the general public. Even the casual
sports fan was captivated by Leonard and Co. _ who built their
names on free television _ while only De La Hoya among today's lot
has managed to pierce the public consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, promoters have a great deal of work ahead if
they hope to create anything resembling the earlier era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can it happen again? I don't think so,'' Leonard said. ``I
don' think it has the potential. Boxing at one time had true
characters and personalities, marquee names.''
</P>
<P>
   No one can argue that Saturday's fight isn't on par with
Leonard-Hearns in terms of boxing.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier group came along at the perfect time, when the
heavyweight division was down. Muhammad Ali's career had just ended
and boxing fans at the time were hungry for new heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, America's darling after his Olympic success, had
already faced Duran twice _ including the famous ``no mas'' fight
in which Leonard avenged an earlier loss _ while the unbeaten
Hearns had built a Tyson-like reputation by stopping 30 of his 32
opponents. It was a mesmerizing backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   Fans in those days couldn't have asked for more. Certainly, the
same can be said for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, both fighters have perfect records _ De La Hoya
31-0 with 25 knockouts, Trinidad 35-0, (30 KOs) _ and it's
difficult to imagine either losing a fight. With the heavyweight
division again in a slide, this is the best boxing has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, no two other fighters alive (with the
possible exception of Mike Tyson) could create such intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN magazine put it well in its calendar listing for Sept. 18:
``Last chance to see what boxing can be _ before Evander
(Holyfield) and Lennox (Lewis) remind you what it actually is.''
</P>
<P>
   This bout is unparalleled in terms of economics.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard and Hearns made huge paydays, particularly the time.
Leonard took home an estimated $11 million, Hearns $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   However, that's chump change compared to the amount of money
generated in the pay-per-view era. De La Hoya could make more than
$20 million when a percentage of pay-per-view buys are factored in,
Trinidad well over $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Promoters Bob Arum and Don King and others involved in the
promotion won't be hurting, either. Organizers are expecting a
pay-per-view buy rate of at least a million, which would be
considerably more than the number of people who saw Leonard-Hearns
because that fight was televised primarily at closed-circuit
venues. It would also break the nonheavyweight record of 760,000
established in the De La Hoya-Pernell Whitaker fight of 1997, but
fall short of the estimated 2 million for Tyson-Holyfield II.
</P>
<P>
   At $50 a buy, that's an automatic $50 million. And that's not
counting closed-circuit or overseas profits, which promise to fill
the deep pockets of those involved with even more cash.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the only area in which Saturday's bout seems to fall
short in comparison to Leonard's era is on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, as with De La Hoya today, was the key cog.
!ital!Millions watched him win his gold medal on ABC and he
continued to build his reputation on free TV. And he appealed to
all ethnic groups _ everyone followed his career.
</P>
<P>
   The others _ Hearns, Duran and Hagler _ never claimed quite that
kind of allegiance but were stars in their own right. Hearns had
that alluring big-punch appeal, Hagler was a complete, seemingly
immoveable force and Duran was a legend.
</P>
<P>
   And they all came along at the same time. They fought eight
times between them _ !ital!eight historic matchups in a span of
nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the definition of of greatness is who you rub up
against in the ring. Each of those men made the others great,''
historian Bert Sugar said.
</P>
<P>
   And today?
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya is the only star among a talented but relatively
anonymous group of fighters in and around the welterweight
division. And even !italhe is no Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing wasn't a featured Olympic event by the time De La Hoya
won America's only gold medal in 1992, although the Barcelona Games
certainly was a significant springboard.
</P>
<P>
   And while De La Hoya is signing more endorsement deals every
day, his reach seems to be limited.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say he's tremendously popular in the Latino market but
not outside it. This is at least in part because his biggest fights
have been seen only by hardcore boxing fans willing to pay
exhorbitant pay-per-view fees while his less-important fights have
been televised on cable's HBO.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond De La Hoya, there is a wasteland. While boxing fans and
those in the business are well aware of Trinidad and his talents,
few others knew who the Spanish-speaking Puerto Rican was before
this fight.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the others in the deep, talented group of today:
Ike Quartey, David Reid, Fernando Vargas and Shane Mosley. Again,
boxing people are aware of the ability of these fine young fighters
but Vargas might be best known among casual fans because of his
recent arrest for assault.
</P>
<P>
   Without De La Hoya in the mix, no one would care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Free TV was such a huge vehicle,'' Leonard said. ``It was what
really catipulted me to stardom. Fathers, mothers, kids,
grandmothers, they all knew me from free TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the fight fans who follow boxing are concentrated on
pay-per-view. It's a different situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there hope?
</P>
<P>
   This match will give boxing what it needs: A megafight worth
watching. The question is whether the powers that be will build on
the momenteum.
</P>
<P>
   If he wins, will De La Hoya give Trinidad a rematch or face Reid
or Vargas or Mosley? If Trinidad wins, will De La Hoya get
!ital!his rematch? And will Quartey, Reid and Vargas _ as well as
other top welerweights _ take the risk of fighting one another to
build interest in themselves and the sport?
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to create a series of meaningful bouts a la the
'80s. That's what this group and boxing needs to recapture the
interest of the mainstream sports fan who seems to have drifted
away.
</P>
<P>
   However, that doesn't mean we'll ever see the likes of
Leonard-Hearns-Duran-Hagler again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing ever really duplicates itself,'' Merchant said.
``Leonard was the one who made the series happen. And you had
Duran, who is considered one of the greatest fighters ever. Then
you had Hearns, a knockout sensation. And then they all grew into
Hagler's division (middleweight).
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it all depends on De La Hoya, win or lose _ who he'll go
after, whether there will be rematch. He will have fought three
excellent fights in a row now (Quartey, Oba Carr and Trinidad). If
that's how he wants to conduct his career and does well in this
fight, then we could start to have something similar to the
(Leonard) era. It's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But not likely. &QL;

CHARLES CRICHTON, FILM DIRECTOR, DIES AT 89
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Crichton, one of the brightest lights in the golden age
of British film comedy in the late 1940s and '50s, and whose
directing career faded and then blazed anew with his last film, ``A
Fish Called Wanda,'' died on Tuesday in London. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   It was after the war that Crichton's talent for comedy came into
bloom when he made classics like ``The Lavender Hill Mob'' (1951),
in which Alec Guinness plays a timid bank clerk who plans and
executes a daring bank robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Another classic, ``The Titfield Thunderbolt'' (1953) concerned
an attempt by villagers to save a branch railway line.
</P>
<P>
   By 1986, Crichton was 75 and had not directed a feature film for
nearly a quarter of a century when he was invited by John Cleese of
``Monty Python's Flying Circus,'' the British television comedy
series, to help develop and eventually direct ``Wanda.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleese had written an early draft for the film and was planning
to play a major role in it. He sought a director with just the
right touch.
</P>
<P>
   The two men had worked together earlier when Crichton directed
more than a dozen lucrative and often funny management-training
films for Video Arts, a film company owned by Cleese.
</P>
<P>
   Impressed by Crichton's skill and dedication to detail in even
such minor films, and mindful that Crichton had directed ``The
Lavender Hill Mob,'' Cleese decided on Crichton to direct
``Wanda.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with considerable industry opposition to his choice,
Cleese used both his reputation and personal wealth (Video Arts had
made him a millionaire) to overcome doubts about Crichton's
stamina, health and unfamiliarity with changes in the world of
feature films.
</P>
<P>
   Once the deal was struck, the two men spent a couple of weeks
together in the south of France working on the plot of ``Wanda''
and some daring comic touches, like a death in wet cement and a
steamroller-driven denouement.
</P>
<P>
   The two labored off and on over the script for two more years.
Even while the movie was in production, Crichton encouraged the
actors _ Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline and the others _ to rethink
the characters they were to play and suggest changes.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the film featured Ms. Curtis as a schemer named
Wanda who seduces several men to get a cache of $20 million worth
of diamonds. Kline plays a sinister but excruciatingly stupid
bandit who makes a meal of pet goldfish.
</P>
<P>
   The satire has unmistakable parallels to ``The Lavender Hill
Mob,'' which starred Alec Guinness. Like ``Wanda,'' it concerned a
monster of a London robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Once filming started, Cleese and Crichton got along famously.
``He's a dear man who's terrified of showing off,'' Cleese said in
an interview soon after the film was released. ``If he says
anything shrewd or insightful, he'll apologize for a minute so he
won't be considered pompous.''
</P>
<P>
   They developed a unique division of their labor. ``Charlie takes
total charge of the cameras and I do quite a lot of direction of
the actors,'' Cleese said. ``He sets up the camera angles and when
he's ready he calls me in. And then I interfere a bit and and make
suggestions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wanda,'' the most successful British film of its time to play
in the United States, was a personal triumph for Crichton, who was
nominated for an Academy Award.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ainslie Crichton was born in Cheshire, England, on Aug.
6, 1910, one of six children of a shipping official. He was
educated at the Oundle School and New College at Oxford University,
where he studied history.
</P>
<P>
   He entered the film industry in 1931 as a film editor,
apprenticing himself to Alexander Korda.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940 he moved to Ealing Studios, whose name would soon become
synonymous with whimsical comedy, but his first opportunity to
direct a feature-length film came in 1943 with ``For Those in
Peril,'' a semidocumentary about the British air-sea rescue
service.
</P>
<P>
   Ealing Studios went into decline in the late 1950s, and by 1960
Crichton had retreated to television.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961 he went to Hollywood, but there his career as a director
of feature films suffered a near-fatal blow. He came to direct
``Birdman of Alcatraz'' with Burt Lancaster, but there were
disagreements and the star fired him after just a week on the job.
Soon after, the sudden death of a producer brought a premature end
to a film Crichton was planning with Sammy Davis Jr.
</P>
<P>
   His subsequent films, which include two thrillers _ ``The Third
Secret'' (1964) and ``He Who Rides a Tiger'' (1965) _ were
disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Back in England, Crichton could not find work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was looking for young audiences and felt they needed
young directors, and I was in my 50s,'' he said in 1988. ``And then
I used a whole year trying to make a film about the Irish Troubles
that never got off the floor. I was out, and once you're out you're
out.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Crichton is survived by his wife, Nadine Haze, of London; and
two sons from a former marriage.
</P>
<P>
   When Cleese and Crichton started work on ``A Fish Called
Wanda,'' they had no idea what the film would be about. Cleese had
always wanted to write a scene in which a man with a stutter wants
to give information and cannot. Crichton had always wanted to show
somebody getting run over by a steamroller. Both scenes are in
''Wanda.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the similarities between ``Wanda'' and ``The Lavender
Hill Mob,'' Crichton said in 1989, there was one big difference. In
the 1950s, the filmmakers weren't allowed to show villains getting
away with it, and Alec Guinness ends up under arrest. At the end of
``Wanda,'' one of the thieves is headed for a life of luxury.
``Hooray!'' Crichton exclaimed.

PANEL AGREES ON OVERHAUL OF INTERNET TAX-COLLECTING METHODS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Resisting political pressure from congressional Republicans, a
high-powered panel of executives and politicians voted Wednesday to
push ahead to develop a system that would make it easy and
practical for Web-based businesses to collect state and local sales
taxes on Internet commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce, is
not yet ready to recommend whether taxes be collected at all on the
Internet. But at the second meeting Wednesday, in New York, the
members appeared to agree that the current quiltwork of levies and
overlapping districts would need an overhaul before Internet
merchants could ever be expected to collect the taxes.
</P>
<P>
   They voted to ask the states, which stand to lose revenues if
their taxes are not applied to electronic commerce, to suggest ways
to simplify the collection in cyberspace of the myriad taxes levied
by more than 7,000 state and local governments in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proposing that we say to the states, `You solve this
problem,''' said Gov. Mike Leavitt of Utah. ``The whole question
is, can you technologically make a system like this work?''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was adopted over the initial objections of the
panel's chairman, Gov. James Gilmore of Virginia, and two tax
opponents on the 19-member commission.
</P>
<P>
   And it came just a day after House Majority Leader Dick Armey,
R-Texas, and 34 colleagues sent the commission a letter expressing
concern that the panel was focusing too much attention on how to
tax the Net, rather than whether to tax it at all.
</P>
<P>
   Although the commission was appointed by Congress last year to
make recommendations on tax policies for the Digital Age, Armey
reminded members that ``only Congress can authorize one state to
compel sellers in another state to collect Internet taxes.'' The
letter described proposals to collect existing taxes as ``new
taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This idea is not a popular one in Congress or among the
American people,'' Armey's letter warned members. ``You should also
know that there are many members that will oppose any new taxes on
the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt, a Republican, laid out his proposal after a morning of
testimony about whether sales taxes should be applied to Internet
commerce and whether the states could make their rates and
collection structures simple enough that even small companies could
accommodate the taxes without being unduly burdened.
</P>
<P>
   The panel hopes to hear proposals from the states and anyone
else who cares to offer a solution at its next meeting, in San
Francisco in December. Its report is due to Congress next spring.
</P>
<P>
   The commission adopted criteria that any Internet tax-collecting
scheme must follow. Topping the list is simplicity: The plans
should not call for any new taxes, they must remove excessive
burdens from the sellers, they must not compromise the privacy of
the buyer, they should acknowledge the sovereignty of states, they
should treat buyers in all states the same, and they should
eliminate multiple audits.

CHURCH SHOOTINGS SEND SAD RIPPLES FAR AND WIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM MADIGAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORTH WORTH, Texas _ Like a Biblical plague, the tragedy at
Wedgwood Baptist Church engulfed a community house by house.
</P>
<P>
   On a gorgeous late-summer night, there were soccer practices and
Little League games, dinners with friends and quiet nights with
families at home. The pulse of Fort Worth and its surrounding
suburbs beat quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the flash of a TV bulletin, a Texas county was plunged
into darkness, a collective anguish made worse by the fact that at
least some of the dead were young people and that they had died in
a church.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday night, even those who had no connection to the
church or the victims spoke of it in quiet voices, shaky with
shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very scary,'' J.J. Shorr said. ``It's very scary.''
</P>
<P>
   For her, as for most who saw the first bulletins on television,
the tragedy of Wedgwood Baptist dawned gradually. Shorr, 73, was
watching the news program ``Dateline'' when the local news broke
in.
</P>
<P>
   There was a shooting, but no news at first of fatalities. The
video was of wounded youngsters. Then there were reports that
teen-agers were dead, and of a deranged gunman who had killed
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Shorr's mind went immediately to her own church and the thriving
youth ministry there, and the nightly Boy Scout meetings, and the
doors that were never locked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would you ever lock a door in a church?'' she asked
slowly. ``That's what went through my mind. Oh, my heaven, our
children are in danger in the most protected place that God ever
made; his own home, but they come in and shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it ironic, she said, that in mass killings the last to die
is the killer, as if that act would somehow bring absolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing sacred,'' she said. ``You know how many good
sweet times you had in church, and to think that this had to
happen. It scares you to think that kids will have a different
feeling about going to church meetings and this type of thing. I'm
hoping there won't, but it's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hannan, coaching a youth soccer team, saw squad cars
speeding by while his team practiced in southwest Fort Worth. He
assumed the police were headed to a traffic accident. Not until
returning home did he learn otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   It was shocking and sad, he said. His two daughters, ages 9 and
7, were both aware of what had happened before going to bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to say to them,'' Hannan said. ``But
obviously, we want to keep them pretty close. It's just a reminder
of how important they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxine Harrington of Fort Worth first believed that the
shootings had happened in some other city. Then she heard the words
``Wedgwood Baptist Church,'' not far from her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goodness, here in Fort Worth, in a church of all places,'' she
said. ``You don't expect a metal detector in church. A church
should be a place open to everyone, not a place where you keep
people out.''
</P>
<P>
   At Rush Creek Christian Church in Arlington, a Fort Worth
suburb, relatives called to check on family members at the church
for Wednesday night choir practice, worried that the gunman might
have somehow escaped to continue his rampage in other sanctuaries.
</P>
<P>
   One member, Janice Lord, is a counselor who has specialized in
assisting crime victims. She has worked after tragedies across the
United States. But what happened Wednesday night much closer to
home seemed to overwhelm even her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel wasted,'' she said. ``You know you've done this a lot,
and you've seen it too much. On one hand, if there's something to
do tomorrow, I want to help. But there's another part of me that
says, `Oh my God, I hope no one calls me.' I don't want to go
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much pain,'' she added. ``This is just not 15 families in
crisis, or a Baptist church in crisis. It's a community in
crisis.''

REALITY BITES FOR ABERCROMBIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After all those yards and all those points,
reality hit Cos Abercrombie, and it felt like a smack in the face.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see that 71 up there, it made me mad,'' said Abercrombie,
Cal State Northridge's starting middle linebacker. ``We played one
of our worst games, one of our worst games ever.''
</P>
<P>
   That isn't an understatement. CSUN's 71-14 loss last week at
Kansas hurt not only Abercrombie's pride, but it was what he called
``a reality check'' for him and for the team.
</P>
<P>
   Abercrombie, the sophomore who had a team-leading 17 tackles
through two games last year before breaking his jaw, admitted he is
playing poorly. He had two tackles against the Jayhawks after
getting just one against Western Oregon in the Matadors' season
opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm working harder than I did last year,'' he said. ``(But) I
think I need to step it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Abercrombie expects his defensive teammates to follow his lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just broke down,'' he said. ``Now we really see what we
need to work on. (Kansas) exploited all our weaknesses. We know we
have to work on our stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas wore down CSUN with 353 rushing yards, including 135 by
David Winbush. The Jayhawks also completed 19 of 25 passes for 284
yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we felt (the Jayhawks) were so much better than
us,'' CSUN defensive line coach David Robinson said. ``Everybody
thinks we could have played better and we should have played
better.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN gets two weeks to think about the debacle in Kansas; the
Matadors have a bye this week.
</P>
<P>
   __ Back in the mix: Sean Beard, the Matadors' starting noseguard
last year, got his first action of the season late in the second
half at Kansas. Beard hurt his right leg in mid-August and was
dropped to third on the depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to climb back up the ladder,'' said Beard, a
senior who had two tackles Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   __ Bumps and bruises: Starting cornerback Chazz Moore sprained
his left ankle against Kansas and hasn't practiced this week.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Kearin, CSUN's interim head coach, said Moore is being held
out only as a precaution and if the Matadors had a game this week,
Moore would be practicing.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, a senior, is expected to be ready to play the Matadors'
Big Sky Conference opener at Eastern Washington on Sept. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Backup defensive end Erik Gardner, who missed six games with
injuries last year, hurt his shoulder against Kansas and isn't
practicing. Ironically, Gardner's younger brother, Isaac, a
redshirt-freshman linebacker, returned to practice last week after
separating his shoulder last month.

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Shortly after the assassination of President
John F. Kennedy, a man who was then one of America's most despised
leaders had microphones shoved in his face as he was asked to give
his reaction to the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm X would utter words that not only repulsed most of the
country at the time, but would cause his own Nation of Islam leader
to ban him to silence for months.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most Americans, Malcolm seemed to show no sign of
remorse, and unlike many politicians of the day, he did not utter
the innocuous overused phrase, ``I'm shocked and saddened.''
</P>
<P>
   The defiant black Muslim activist distinctly proclaimed in 1963:
</P>
<P>
   ``The chickens have come home to roost.''
</P>
<P>
   He was acutely accurate and, in hindsight, profoundly poignant.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Wednesday's tragic shootings in a Fort Worth
church, those words now reverberate in the city where Kennedy spent
his last night before heading to Dallas on that fateful November
morning.
</P>
<P>
   No one really understood Malcolm X then, because no one really
tried.
</P>
<P>
   His comments weren't meant to be flip during one of America's
most painful moments, nor were they intended to be disrespectful to
the slain president.
</P>
<P>
   He was simply saying that in a country where violence is so
prevalent _ sometimes revered _ and in a nation that was so
tolerant of hatred toward those who were different, we should not
be surprised when violence rises up close to home and claims one of
our own who is greatly admired, truly cherished or deeply loved.
</P>
<P>
   As with other cities in recent months, myhome town is in
mourning this day, befuddled by a catastrophe that no one ever
believed could happen here.
</P>
<P>
   On a Wednesday night, when church people all over the state are
in prayer meetings, the unthinkable happens in a house of God, and
we all begin crying, ``Lord, have mercy.''
</P>
<P>
   But in light of so many destructive acts against so many
innocent people, our doubts intrude our good thoughts and we begin
to ask, ``Lord, don't you have any mercy left?''
</P>
<P>
   This was not God's doing. It was man's. It was ours.
</P>
<P>
   We should have paid attention to the chickens, for they've been
headed home to the roost for some time.
</P>
<P>
   For years, in our blind and selfish arrogance, we have sent the
wrong messages to adults and teen-agers about violence, and then
feigned shock when our communities were rocked by random senseless
man-made calamities.
</P>
<P>
   We live in a state where politicians feel that during campaigns
they have to be seen with guns as big as their smiles, shooting
down some innocent critter.
</P>
<P>
   It's expected. How can you get elected in Texas these days
without proclaiming your love for guns?
</P>
<P>
   Just this year, the Texas Legislature passed a law prohibiting
government agencies, counties and municipalities from suing gun or
ammunition manufacturers. Gov. George W. Bush ceremoniously signed
the bill in May.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years earlier, the state proudly instituted the
right-to-carry law, allowing citizens to carry concealed weapons.
(I'm sure I'll hear after this massacre that if someone in the Fort
Worth church had been ``packing,'' this tragedy could have been
prevented or lessened.)
</P>
<P>
   Although Fort Worth leaders have expressed concern about the
regularly scheduled gun shows held in public buildings, they have
not voted to prevent these blatant displays and the sale of
firearms.
</P>
<P>
   After a dreadful event like the one in this city Wednesday
night, we'll hear plenty of words denouncing violence.
Unfortunately, our actions continue to speak loudly to the
contrary.
</P>
<P>
   Above all the rhetoric, there will be a loud flapping noise ...
of the chickens coming home to roost.

SHOOTING SCENES ON TV HIT TOO CLOSE TO HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Scenes of tragic shootings have become so
common on the television screen that local viewers who happened to
catch the indelible images of sobbing teens and swirling emergency
vehicle lights Wednesday figured it was another bloody episode in
another part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't. It was here in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   This time CNN was patched into WFAA/Channel 8 instead of the ABC
affiliate looking for ways to localize a story that was far from
home.
</P>
<P>
   What didn't change, unfortunately, was the kind of
misinformation that tends to seep out when TV news organizations
are scrambling to get it first before getting it right. Both the
ABC affiliate and the CBS affiliate, Channel 11, were reporting
deaths before they were confirmed, and the number kept changing.
The information was being picked up by MSNBC and CNN and quickly
dispersed to the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   With news crews trying to get as much information as fast as
they could, witnesses were rounded up, and drilled accordingly.
Most were willing, even eager, to share their stories on TV, to
share what tiny morsels of information they had on a gunmen who
walked into the church and started firing.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC affiliate was on the air by 7:30 p.m., shortly after the
shooting occurred, and the rest of the stations followed.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't much to show in terms of video. Many of the
stations showed parents racing to find out what happened to their
children. The Fox affiliate, KDFW/Channel 4, relied on the same
footage: crying teenagers on the front lawn of the Wedgwood Baptist
Church. Viewers had to wait and sort it all out.
</P>
<P>
   All-news stations such as CNN relied heavily on local stations,
breaking in with fresh information as they got it, while trying to
cover another breaking story: Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, local news organizations had to play catch-up through
most of the event, scrambling to find eyewitnesses and piece
together information.
</P>
<P>
   All five local stations called in additional personnel to help
cover what would be the biggest breaking story since a blaze
engulfed the Branch Davidian compound outside Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Covering stories of this nature is, of course, where television
earns its stripes. Or falls on its face. Many of the witnesses had
little information to share, but that didn't keep reporters from
digging up something, anything.
</P>
<P>
   The young pony-tailed girl on the Fox affiliate, who looked no
more than 10, talked of actually seeing the gunmen ``take the gun
and kill himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The young man on the CBS affiliate, said, ``I didn't see
anything, but what I heard I never want to hear again.''
</P>
<P>
   Camera crews camped en masse outside John Peter Smith Hospital,
trying to dig up names and give viewers more information. In the
meantime, they were forced to run video of the melee outside the
church, sticking cameras in the faces of screaming teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   With the potential to cross the line between information and
exploitation, news executives said they were trying to be sensitive
and not bother people who wanted to keep their trauma private.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't keep the ABC affiliate's Angela Kocherga from
asking a teen-ager, ``Can you describe the shooter?''
</P>
<P>
   As time moved on, the news organizations went into analysis
mode, trying to ask ``why?'' The ABC affiliate interviewed Dr. John
Lehman of the Red Cross Mental Health team while the CBS
affiliate's Ginger Allen rounded up students outside John Peter
Smith. Local viewers can expect more of that in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   What's certain is that few things are as chilling as hearing a
TV anchor (Channel 8's Scott Sams) warn his audience that ``Some of
the following might be graphic...''
</P>
<P>
   CNN's Judd Rose summed it up well when he turned back to the
camera after having viewed footage from Channel 8. ``It just never
seems to end, does it?'' he said.

WITNESS RECALLS A NIGHT OF HORROR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAN REED 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A band was playing and students were singing
songs of praise when Aaron Bray heard gunshots from the church
lobby behind him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then, a shot was fired into the sanctuary through a glass window
in the door. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt something go by my arm. I don't know if it was glass or
the bullet,'' said Bray, 18, a senior at Crowley High School, who
was sitting in the center section of the fan-shaped church. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, Bray said, the gunman entered the sanctuary from
the right rear corner and walked toward the students gathered up
front. He began firing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hear him say anthing,'' Bray said two hours later at
an elementary school across the street. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounded like a handgun. He wasn't firing fast enough for it
to be an automatic; maybe semiautomatic, but not automatic,'' Bray
said. ``He fired many, many times. My guess, at least 30.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bray dropped to the floor to seek cover and does not think the
gunman came near him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point, I heard a big bang. At first I thought he was
close to me and shot. But I guess now that that's when the pipe
bomb went off,'' he said, referring to an explosion that occurred
near the front of the sanctuary. &QL; 
.MDBO/.MDNM/ Bray said shrapnel flew about the front half of the
sanctuary. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A piece of it came down and hit me on the back of the neck,
but it didn't hurt,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bray described the shooting in almost surreal terms. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We never knew if it was real or part of the show,'' Bray said.
``Some people up in the balcony were giggling, some even laughing.
There was no screaming.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ben Killmer, 17, another Crowley High School senior who was in
the sanctuary when the shooting began, spoke in similar terms. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really knew it was for real until it was over and the
cops were running us out of there, and I saw blood on people's
clothes and some of the bodies and wounded people lying around,''
Killmer said. ``Then I saw the shooter slumped over a pew in the
back, dead. Then I knew it was for real. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so strange,'' he said. ``People were smiling, at least
at first, and laughing. It was hard to believe it was really
happening.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Killmer said he saw what he believes was the first shot fired
into the sanctuary. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard some noise out in the hallway and turned around to
look back and I saw this guy with a gun through the window in the
doorway,'' he said. ``I saw the gun in his hand. I saw him shoot
through the glass and the glass fly. Then I remember looking at the
door and seeing the bullet hole in the glass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the last thing I saw until the cops came in and started
telling us to get out of there,'' said Killmer, who took cover on
the floor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bray and Killmer estimated that the shooting lasted for between
two and three minutes, although both said that they felt their
sense of time had been distorted. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw that shot come through the glass in the door at the
back, I had about a million thoughts all at once,'' Killmer said.
``Everything seemed to be moving so slow. It seemed like he kept
shooting for a couple of minutes, maybe more. He kept shooting and
shooting. But maybe it wasn't that long; it just seemed like it,
sort of like the way you remember things in a car wreck taking a
lot longer to happen than they really did.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bray said, ``It was pretty long time. I'd guess two to three
minutes. He shot and shot and shot. And then the shooting stopped.
Then there were a couple of more shots, and it stopped again. Then
we heard one last shot; it was kind of a muffled shot. I guess
that's when he shot himself. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A few seconds later, the police were in there with their guns
on him, yelling at us all to get out,'' Bray said. ``We got out
pretty quickly. I guess he shot himself because the police were
coming in, but I don't know for sure. I was on the floor.'' &QL;

LIFE WITH FATHER NOT SO EASY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Oscar De La Hoya has received many rewards for his
success in the ring: money, fame and gratification, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   One he hasn't received hits closer to home: the praise of his
father, Joel De La Hoya Sr.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, this is important to De La Hoya, whose mother died
shortly before his gold-medal run in the 1992 Olympics. Joel Sr. is
his son's closest adviser for a reason: De La Hoya loves and
respects his father deeply.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya said on national television that nothing _ not even
another world title _ would mean more to him than his father's
approval.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, life with dad isn't always easy. Joel Sr.,
once a fighter himself, is tough. De La Hoya described him this
way: ``He's a Mexican father. He has a big ego. He won't tell me
(he's proud of me). One day he will.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Joel Sr. is quick to display his displeasure but has yet
to provide positive reinforcement. Take the aftermath of the Ike
Quartey fight in February, one of De La Hoya's proudest moments as
he knocked down his challenger in the 12th and final round to
retain his championship.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Sr.'s reaction?
</P>
<P>
   ``He was mad,'' De La Hoya said. ``He said I didn't put enough
pressure on him, I shouldn't have given him so much respect. He was
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, De La Hoya is grateful he isn't in the shoes of his
opponent for Saturday, Felix Trinidad, who is trained by his
father. De La Hoya is trained by Robert Alcazar.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Sr. spent a total of about three weeks at his son's
three-month Big Bear training camp to keep an eye on things after
what he perceived as a near disaster against Quartey. That was
plenty of time for De La Hoya, who doesn't need that kind of
pressure on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine how it is,'' De La Hoya said. ``. . . If my
father came every day, I would be annoyed. I really would.''
</P>
<P>
   He does need that praise, though.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya said publicly that he hopes it comes if he beats
Trinidad. What better time than after what might be the defining
moment in a great career?
</P>
<P>
   It ain't gonna happen.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Sr. said he doesn't withhold praise because he has
difficulty expressing his feelings. He does it as one way to keep
his son motivated. Constant pursuit of a father's approval creates
a beneficial edge, he reasons.
</P>
<P>
   One day he'll tell his son exactly how he feels.
</P>
<P>
   ``After his career is over, we'll get drunk and hug and cry,''
Joel Sr. said. ``For now, I want to keep him motivated. That's what
it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it tough love.
</P>
<P>
   __ No big bet: Don King, Trinidad's promoter, offered at
Wednesday's news conference to bet Bob Arum, De La Hoya's promoter,
$1 million on the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Arum, angered by the suggestion, would have none of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's totally inappropriate for managers or promoters
to bet on fights,'' he said. ``In 35 years, I've never bet on a
boxing match. Anyone on my staff who !ital!would bet on boxing
would be fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand (Don), in putting Trinidad in the ring
with Oscar De La Hoya, you're risking a lot more than $1 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Arum had better hope that De La Hoya understands why his
promoter wouldn't back him with a measly million.
</P>
<P>
   __ Annoyed: No one is more fed up with the boasts of Trinidad
and his father than veteran trainer Gil Clancy, who works with
Alcazar.
</P>
<P>
   When it was time for him to step to the podium at the news
conference, after Trinidad reiterated all the horrible things he
would do to De La Hoya, Clancy said simply: ``All I can say is, if
this was a talking contest, we'd lose. We'll see you on Saturday in
the arena.''
</P>
<P>
   However, at an earlier gathering of reporters, Clancy did his
own boasting.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he believes De La Hoya will win, Clancy said: ``He has
faster hand speed, faster foot speed, more power, a better chin,
he's fought better fighters and he's better in the clutch. How's
that?''
</P>
<P>
   __ Judging the judges: No one in Trinidad's camp seems to be
overly concerned about judging in what is perceived as a home-field
advantage for De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   In good part, that's the result of the Nevada State Athletic
Commission's reputation. Nevada officials assured Trinidad and Co.
there would be no bias.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, it ain't gonna go the distance. The
judges are in his hands,'' King said, pointing at Trinidad's fists.
</P>
<P>
   __ Staples date: Arum reiterated that he has a Dec. 11 date at
the new Staples Center, where De La Hoya is expected to challenge
WBC super welterweight champion Francisco Castillejo if he wins on
Saturday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Bud. Today you take the first little steps toward, maybe, Giant
Steps.
</P>
<P>
   Your new Leblanc saxophone looks beautiful and will someday
produce beautiful music _ if you keep your cork greased, take good
care of your reeds and mind your director.
</P>
<P>
   And practice a lot.
</P>
<P>
   You're my new favorite sax player, the latest in a long line of
favorites.
</P>
<P>
   As a jazz fan, I've studied a lot of great players. My
recollection may be a little fuzzy in places, but I think you can
learn a little from each of the masters discussed below.
</P>
<P>
   Lester Young, for example, kept his room very clean at all
times.
</P>
<P>
   Cannonball Adderley seldom com plained about homework.
</P>
<P>
   Benny Carter actually liked math word problems.
</P>
<P>
   As a youth, Phil Woods frequently talked about topics other than
Poke mon and The Simpsons.
</P>
<P>
   James Carter never uses the words friggin' or freakin'.
</P>
<P>
   In his younger days, Lee Konitz brushed his teeth _ twice a day
_ without being told.
</P>
<P>
   The young Richie Cole didn't ask every single night if his
family was going out for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The young Wayne Shorter never audibly sighed when told that Mom
was cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Ornette Coleman never talked his grandma into letting him stay
up all night watching the Cartoon Net work.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Henderson takes the trash out before it overflows onto the
kitchen floor.
</P>
<P>
   Branford Marsalis tries all different kinds of foods.
</P>
<P>
   Maceo Parker uses soap every time he bathes. And, when the
subject of South Park comes up, he doesn't automatically begin
listing all of his friends who are allowed to watch it.
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Clemons doesn't do ``chemistry experiments'' in the
bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Redman doesn't get carried away on the Game Boy.
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Rollins' dad didn't have to tell him three times, every
time.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Webster had excellent telephone etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Fortune kept a very tidy school desk.
</P>
<P>
   He had a few character flaws, true, but Charlie Parker didn't
stand at the refrigerator with the door open.
</P>
<P>
   In noisy restaurants, little Art Pepper spoke clearly to
waitresses.
</P>
<P>
   John Coltrane loved miniature golf, GameWorks and Laser Quest,
too, but not every weekend.
</P>
<P>
   As a lad, Stan Getz was quite satisfied with his allowance, what
ever it was.
</P>
<P>
   Dexter Gordon could be driven past a Circle K without mentioning
how good a Slurpee would taste right now.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Desmond understood the im portance of sun block.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Dolphy didn't enjoy telling and retelling the story about
how his dad graduated from college by literally begging for a D
from his ma rine-biology professor.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Brecker never leaves snack wrappers anywhere but in the
trash.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman Hawkins didn't repeatedly recall for his grandmother the
one afternoon he and his dad went to the corner bar to play darts.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny G, on the other hand, was kind of a rotten kid.  &LR; 4 Dave

`ANGEL OF SAIGON' REUNITED WITH ORPHANS SHE GAVE NEW LIVES TO

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ As children, they knew her as American Lady, Miss
Betty or, simply, the Angel of Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   As adults, they know her as a bridge to their past _ to the day
in April 1975 when they were airlifted from the An Lac Orphanage in
Saigon to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, for the first time, three of the 219 airlifted met
Betty Tisdale _ the woman who fed them, changed them, brought them
toys and arranged for their escape from An Lac.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming to see you, that has made the connection,'' Mary
Tripoli, 26, told Tisdale as they sat in the living room of
Tisdale's Queen Anne home in Seattle, poring over photographs and
newspaper clippings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work that you did not only impacted my life in big ways,
but others as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Tripoli hadn't considered meeting Tisdale until several weeks
ago, when an invitation arrived from the Greater Seattle Vietnamese
Association asking her to attend a banquet honoring Tisdale for her
work.
</P>
<P>
   Others flew in for Wednesday night's banquet, including Dinh
Dolan, 33, a chef from San Francisco, and Vikki Solviter-Wheeler,
26, a health care manager from Boston.

   ``We were all raised in the same place, that's a big
connection,'' Dolan said.
</P>
<P>
   The three gathered in Tisdale's living room Wednesday, telling
stories about their lives and asking Tisdale to fill in some of the
blanks.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan, who was 9 when he left Saigon and was among the older
children, recalled the orphanage and asked about the well near the
gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember growing up, playing with a lot of kids, sleeping
together in one room on the floor,'' said Dolan, who grew up on a
farm near Lock Haven, Pa. ``It seemed like everything happened very
fast. When I arrived in the U.S., it was totally a different world
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Tisdale looked the proud mother as three of her ``children,'' as
she called them, plied her with questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of felt that eventually you all would come home once in
a while,'' Tisdale told them during lunch. ``You need to know that
it was a loving place. You were well-loved.''
</P>
<P>
   The three always knew about Tisdale. They knew the story of how
they were brought to the United States and adopted by their
respective parents. They knew that Shirley Jones portrayed Tisdale
in a movie.
</P>
<P>
   How could they not know?
</P>
<P>
   Local newspapers, even a newsletter from a diaper service,
featured their adoptions. Their parents told them stories,
encouraged them to look into their heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan's mother clipped newspaper articles when he was young.
Tripoli's mother did, too. Solviter-Wheeler's mother tried for
years to encourage her to take a trip to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   But none of them was ready to make contact with Tisdale until
later, when they were in their early 20s and 30s, when the question
of identity began to chip away at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think about my background at all,'' said
Sloviter-Wheeler, who was adopted by a Jewish family. ``In my 20s,
I began to grapple with the whole identity issue. What are you?''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, she said, she didn't even consider herself Asian.
</P>
<P>
   In college, she took the first steps toward learning about her
past with a history paper on Operation Babylift, which allowed the
United States to bring babies from Vietnam on an emergency basis.
</P>
<P>
   Then she entered a contest last year sponsored by Life magazine
and named Tisdale as the person she most wanted to meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no other way in which to come to terms with my
past,'' she said. ``I'd always known about Betty through the
movies. But it didn't mean anything. Shirley Jones was Betty
Tisdale.''
</P>
<P>
   Sloviter-Wheeler said she saw the movie, which was based on
Tisdale, and later bought a copy of it.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to Tisdale over lunch Wednesday, she said to her: ``You
were like this movie star, this legend.''
</P>
<P>
   Tisdale first learned about An Lac after reading a book by Dr.
Tom Dooley, a Navy lieutenant known for his work establishing
clinics in Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. She decided to see for
herself.
</P>
<P>
   What she saw, she never forgot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just changed my life completely,'' Tisdale said. ``I knew I
could never be the same girl I was before with the nice job, the
cocktail parties and nice clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   An Lac was founded by Madame Vu Thi Ngai. Tisdale returned to it
every winter afterward with toys, clothing and money. She raised
money by appealing to people's love of children.
</P>
<P>
   She resorted to cajoling, even harmless tricks, to do what she
could for the children.
</P>
<P>
   She once pretended to be a stewardess, wearing the uniform blue
skirt and white blouse, to fly to Vietnam for free.
</P>
<P>
   She sweet-talked military officials into allowing her to fill
vacant space on their airplanes with playpens, cribs, toys and
other things for the orphans.
</P>
<P>
   She even persuaded the mother of the secretary of the Army to
allow her to use the barracks at Fort Benning, Ga., to house the
children once she managed to get them out of Vietnam, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know how to cook or do anything, I just knew how to
raise money,'' said Tisdale, who worked as a private secretary to
the late Sen. Jacob Javits and later raised a family when she
wasn't raising money for An Lac.
</P>
<P>
   On April 5, 1975, as the North Vietnamese Communists advanced
toward Saigon, Tisdale got unusual permission from the South
Vietnamese government to get the children out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   But they would not allow children 10 and older to leave.
</P>
<P>
   So Tisdale filled a C141 Starlifter cargo plane with 219
children, along with 38 children from other orphanages. She had to
leave 131 children behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were thrusting their children at me. `Take my baby,
take my baby,''' Tisdale remembered.
</P>
<P>
   They arrived in the U.S. Army base in Fort Benning after making
a stop in Los Angeles. The children spent the first night in an
abandoned kindergarten building and eventually found adoptive
families.
</P>
<P>
   Tisdale's aunt and uncle took her in and raised her in a
middle-class environment when her father died when she was 9 and
her mother became ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize it then but I realize now how important it
was for somebody to take a child in and raise them,'' Tisdale said.
``Maybe that was the beginning of what was inside me.''

 OVERSTAGED HILFIGER UPSTAGED BY IMPROVS  (rk) 
 By CATHY HORYN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Everybody has heard of Tommy Hilfiger. But who has
heard of Miguel Adrover or Lola Faturoti? Or, for that matter,
anybody who doesn't have a colossal advertising budget, who stages
a fashion show in the dead of night in some broken-down theater on
the Lower East Side, with nothing for props except a plywood runway
and some dried marsh grass gathered from the side of the New Jersey
Turnpike?
</P>
<P>
   The mind boggles at the contrasts between the show Hilfiger
staged on Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden (in the adjacent
smaller theater but still the Garden) and the one Adrover put on an
hour later downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger had Bush, the British rock band, on the stage, while
the audience sat facing the runway, away from the band. The way the
stony-faced crowd ignored the boys in the band _ well, you would
have thought they were playing to a retirement home. The musicians
got so mad, or at least seemed to, that when the show was over and
everyone was going for the exits, the lead guitarist shouted,
``Thank you very much,'' except the ``thank'' came out as a swear
word.
</P>
<P>
   Adrover, on the other hand, had a lot of funky people, including
British designer Alexander McQueen, a friend of his, sitting around
on folding chairs drinking beer. The crowd was alive, and now and
then McQueen let out a wolf whistle.
</P>
<P>
   Adrover has a rich imagination. His collection, put together on
a shoestring budget, was based on the idea of a woman living in a
South American jungle, scraping together what she can find, and
then coming to New York, where a culture of brand names changes her
style. This might mean a miniskirt salvaged from a Louis Vuitton
bag, with the handles lapping at her sides, or a strapless cotton
dress smudged with paint and appliqued with scraps of newspaper,
like a littered wall of graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   Although other designers, notably Xuly Bet, have made similar
conceptual statements, where Adrover excels is in his technique and
originality. It is hard to give clothes a sense of both history and
newness with red-and-white linen damask that looked as if it came
off a table in someone's home and a top shredded so finely
(probably with a razor blade) that it looked like strings of beads.
But Adrover did.
</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger's clothes, despite the fact that his cowboy boots were
inset with the words ``Tommy Rocks,'' seemed to have nothing in
common with the atmosphere he was trying to create. The clothes
were sanitized renditions of a rowdy Western theme _ flame-licked
leather pants, floral-yoke cowboy shirts, trophy belt buckles _
that tougher customers, like hogback Harley-Davidson riders, have
already blazed.
</P>
<P>
   It is a pity that more people did not see Ms. Faturoti's gem of
a show, which drew a small crowd on Wednesday morning to Nobu, the
TriBeCa restaurant. She, too, has relied on the kindness of
strangers, mainly Nadja Swarovski, whose company produces crystals
for the fashion business, and Peter Arnell, the marketing
consultant, who donated money to produce her show. In all, it cost
about $60,000, the designer said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Faturoti, who took a break from fashion for a few years,
gave deconstruction an elegant polish, overlaying deep blue
crocheted lace on a gold satin chemise, for instance, and splicing
vivid yellow damask into a black wool dress, leaving the ends of
the fabric bolt that say ``100 percent merino wool'' around the
hem. The show was smart, with surprising touches like a grill of
metallic ruffles over a satin back, and it ended with exquisite
colonial dresses, an ironic allusion to Ms. Faturoti's Nigerian
upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Lauren is not a hard guy to figure out. Oh, he may have
his eccentric whimsies, like keeping a barber around (Howard
Hughes, one may recall, did the same), but he is not a complicated
ball of wax. On Wednesday, he proved that with a collection so
purely sexy that when the model Giselle came swinging down the
runway in navy polka-dot leather jeans and a matching bikini top,
one could almost swear the retail bosses in the front row were
lifted right out of their shoes. The grins!
</P>
<P>
   Well, all right. Lauren is one designer who knows how to work
within a narrow groove _ good old corn-fed American sexiness. Here
were slim gingham trousers in red or navy with stretch tops and
mules, hot pants in banker-gray glen plaid and pinstriped skirts
with girlishly ruffled hems, worn with untucked white shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren may wish he hadn't shown white eyelet leather, a trend
this week and already wearing thin. At least he didn't get too
wrapped up in it.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, you can imagine women wearing these clothes, which
can't be said of a lot of what goes down a runway. The look is
exactly like the clean, racy minimalism seen on fashion editors _
skinny pants, sexy heels. Except Lauren had the good sense to view
it as a woman from the Midwest might _ from a safe distance.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The terrace of Lever House at Park Avenue and 53rd Street, would
have been a good place for Daryl Kerrigan to show on Tuesday if she
wasn't such an adorable sad sack. She is adorable in the sense that
she believes in putting clothes in a political context, and her
urban gear has made her a thorn, in the long tradition of Vivienne
Westwood and Rudi Gernreich.
</P>
<P>
   But it's difficult in the extreme to look up Park, with all that
blue glass and steel rising optimistically behind you, and imagine
women wearing nylon storm suits and ``OSHA orange'' tops. What are
they afraid of? Catching a cold at Barneys?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kerrigan's moody collection of blouson tops and asymmetrical
leather jeans, in black and murky botanical colors, was intended to
be a balm against the times: specifically, her program notes
stated, the ``threat of war, death, disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Wow!
</P>
<P>
   There were bright spots _ summery cotton dresses with zip-on,
zip-off ruffles, winged Princess Leia shoulders in the style of
Nicolas Guesquiere of Balenciaga, but where, in such a modern
setting, was the unclouded vision of Daryl K?
</P>
<P>
   If there was a clue to John Bartlett's show, with its
well-traveled theme of exotic mischief, it was in the signboard
backstage instructing the models to be guerrilla ballerinas and
sexy revolutionaries. They were also advised to ``be happy and
smile.''
</P>
<P>
   Although a lot of designers have been down this road before,
mixing harem sensuality with European tailoring, Bartlett did it
with modern gusto. To black or golden-tan leather trousers laced up
the sides, he added filmy tops of plise chiffon or shirts flecked
with gold. There was a sense of things worn and borrowed, like
chocolate-brown leather jodhpurs and a slip dress of strips of
black, white and tan chiffon inspired by the prints of Sonia
Delaunay. The designer took those prints and rearranged them, in a
group of squares, say, on chiffon trousers, so that they became a
kind of memento, like scraps in a Peter Beard diary.
</P>
<P>
   The collection was also a breakthrough for Bartlett, who said
afterward that he had received a call this summer from Joan Kaner,
the fashion director of Neiman Marcus, advising him to be more a
proponent of the sensual than the frankly sexual. With strong,
wearable things like a white twill trench coat casually mixed with
golden chiffon trousers (and poppy-red shoes), he obviously took
her advice. A long line of retailers waited backstage to praise
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird,'' Bartlett said, grinning. ``It's, like, where's
the bride or the groom?''

YANKS COME BACK AGAIN TO BEAT TORONTO, 6-4 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ What could the Red Sox have been thinking while
watching the scoreboard in Cleveland the last couple of days? What
about the Oakland Athletics _ what was going through their minds,
as they followed the Yankees' progress here?
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox must have felt good when they saw Toronto's crooked
run totals on the scoreboard, and watched the Blue Jays build a
five-run lead late in Tuesday's game. They might have been
encouraged when the Blue Jays posted an early-inning advantage
Wednesday night. But how did the Red Sox and Athletics feel when
they saw the Yankees rebound to win crazily Tuesday, with grand
slams in back-to-back innings? They must have been shocked again
Wednesday night, when they saw the Yankees roar back to beat
Toronto, 6-4, and take the final two games of this three-game
series.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the teams chasing the Yankees might have figured it was
about time.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they thought the defending champions would eventually
emerge from their late-season fog and begin to play like a team
stacked with an All-Star lineup, deep starting pitching and
veterans who played through much worse slumps than that which the
Yankees have experienced this month.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams, who silently mulls his hitting slumps as if he
were trying to solve a challenging math equation, has apparently
found the answers. He hammered a two-run homer Wednesday night to
snap a 4-4 tie; it was Williams who tied Tuesday's game with a
grand slam in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Pettitte (13-11) recovered from one very bad inning and
lasted eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're back on track,'' manager Joe Torre said, ``as far as our
confidence is concerned. And they're feeling good about
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said, ``This definitely gives us a pretty good boost
going into Cleveland.''
</P>
<P>
   So long as Hurricane Floyd permits, the Yankees (87-58) will
begin a four-game series with the Indians Thursday, their last
games against any team playing over .500 during the regular season.
The Yankees, whose magic number for clinching the division is 14,
play seven games against Tampa Bay in the final two weeks, three
against the Chicago White Sox and three versus Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Williams spoke before the game of how perhaps Tuesday's comeback
would remind the Yankees of how good they could be, and give them
something on which to build the rest of their season. ``We're just
going to feed off of that and keep it going,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   He and the Yankees put his theory to the test immediately.
Pettitte, who had needed just 37 pitches in the first three
innings, became estranged with the strike zone, walked three, gave
up a home run to Carlos Delgado and made a bad pitch to Homer Bush;
the Blue Jays' second baseman ripped a two-run double and Toronto
led, 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez led off the fifth inning, in the Yankees' very
first at-bat after Pettitte allowed the four runs. Pat Hentgen, the
Toronto pitcher, tried zipping a fastball past him inside, but did
not jam him enough; Martinez stepped into the pitch, twisted his
torso and smashed a home run well over the right-field wall. It was
a counterattack typical of the Yankees of 1998: If the other team
scores, then the Yankees respond immediately.
</P>
<P>
   And they kept chipping away, aided by the sort of good fortune
that seemed deeded to them last year. Chili Davis, the designated
hitter, checked his swing, but the pitch hit his bat anyway _ and
flew over the head of third baseman Tony Fernandez for a double.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ledee then pulled a line drive between the center and
right fielders, the ball skittering along the artificial surface
like a flat rock on water. Davis rambled home, Ledee pulled into
third with a triple. Torre would say later that it was this hit
that charged the inning, for with nobody out, the Yankees were only
a run down and Ledee was only 90 feet from scoring the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's infielders moved in and Joe Girardi, the Yankees'
catcher, hit a ground ball at shortstop Tony Batista _ but the ball
glanced off Batista's glove, and Ledee scored.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were rolling at this point. The first two Toronto
batters reached base in the bottom of the fifth, but Ledee, who had
made a great catch while running into the wall in the third inning,
gloved a fly ball that carried over his head in the fifth and
sabotaged Toronto's rally.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees counterattacked again: Derek Jeter walked, and with
one out, Williams blistered a changeup beyond the wall in right
field. He had all but danced around the bases Tuesday and screamed
to teammates after crossing home plate, but this time, Williams was
all business. The Yankees were all business again, confident, in
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two games, we're playing like we know how to play,''
said Mariano Rivera, who pitched the last inning for his 41st save.
``We're playing like the Yankees now.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, most of the Yankees took paper plates filled
with beans and rice and stationed themselves in the trainer's room
to watch the last innings of the game between the Red Sox and
Indians. ``It's tough,'' one player said happily. ``You don't know
who to root for.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Yankees laughed at the thought. Scoreboard watching is a
lot easier when the other guys have to watch you win.

VENDOR TAKES SWING AT D-BACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - By this late in the season, Scott Fader should be
farther behind the Arizona Diamondbacks than the San Francisco
Giants. He shouldn't be in a pennant race. He shouldn't even be in
the league.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, here's Fader, standing up against the best the big boys
can throw at him and swinging for the fences.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tried to put me out of business, and now I want the
courts to tell them what they're doing is illegal,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Fader publishes an alternative program called Beat on Baseball,
which he sells before home games outside Bank One Ballpark for $1
each. Last year, the Dia mondbacks sold its ``official'' game pro
gram for $5.
</P>
<P>
   Fader whipped the home team, hitting 'em out of the park without
ever entering the ball yard.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, the Diamondbacks reduced the price on their
larger, fancier (more costly to produce) program to $3 each, then
to $1 _ at least around the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The last time I bought one at a retail store, it cost $3.95.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, the Diamondbacks have kept Fader and his vendors
from selling Beat on Baseball on the plaza adjacent to the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   SALES TAKE PLUNGE
</P>
<P>
   His sales dropped 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fader believes the Diamondbacks are trying to put him out of
business. Each time I've asked team President Rich Dozer about
that, however, he's denied it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to increase our cir culation,'' he told me.
</P>
<P>
   Fader doesn't buy it, and he doesn't be lieve a jury will,
either.
</P>
<P>
   This week, he sued the Diamondbacks in federal court, claiming
the team vio lated antitrust laws through what the law suit calls
``a predatory pricing scheme designed to lessen competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Fader also claims to have been slan dered by team
representatives who alleg edly referred to his publication as
``pornographic'' for carrying advertise ments from topless bars.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the lawsuit contends Fader should be able to sell Beat
on Baseball on the stadium plaza, which it says is public property.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Diamondbacks are in Cooperstown, N.Y., for
league meetings this week. I'm told they haven't yet seen the
lawsuit and, therefore, can't comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want any part of a court case,'' Fader says. `'But
this is really a matter of principle. And, luckily, I have the
resources to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He shouldn't. OUT-OF-STATE REVENUE
</P>
<P>
   On paper, Fader should have gone broke months ago. He would
have, too, if he hadn't done what all successful base ball
franchises do _ he developed a farm team.
</P>
<P>
   When the Seattle Mariners moved into the new stadium earlier
this season, Fader and his vendors were outside selling a $1
program called The Seattle Slugger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done very well in Seattle,'' Fader says. ``And because
of that, I'm able to pursue our case here in Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the lawsuit, Fader hopes to re cover the losses of the
past year, along with attorneys fees and punitive damages. Whether
any of that will happen is diffi cult to predict.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits aren't like baseball games. Since opening day in April,
the Diamond backs have slowly separated themselves from the rest of
their division by winning more games than the other guys.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the season winds down, fans are matching Diamondback
wins against rival losses, awaiting the point where a playoff spot
is guaranteed for the home team while the others are mathematically
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   That's the ``magic number'' baseball fans around Phoenix are
talking about.
</P>
<P>
   A lawsuit doesn't work that way.
</P>
<P>
   Several seasons can pass without it be ing resolved. And the
umpires (in black robes) can call the whole thing off at any time.
And victory isn't determined only by winning _ but by how much you
win.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is fine with Scott Fader.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't care which big gun the D-Backs hurl at him.
</P>
<P>
   Not as long as, in the end, the magic number is set by a jury.

   This year, however, the Diamondbacks reduced the price on their
larger, fancier (more costly to produce) program to $3 each, then
to $1 _ at least around the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The last time I bought one at a retail store, it cost $3.95.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, the Diamondbacks have kept Fader and his vendors
from selling Beat on Baseball on the plaza adjacent to the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   SALES TAKE PLUNGE
</P>
<P>
   His sales dropped 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fader believes the Diamondbacks are trying to put him out of
business. Each time I've asked team President Rich Dozer about
that, however, he's denied it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to increase our cir culation,'' he told me.
</P>
<P>
   Fader doesn't buy it, and he doesn't be lieve a jury will,
either.
</P>
<P>
   This week, he sued the Diamondbacks in federal court, claiming
the team vio lated antitrust laws through what the law suit calls
``a predatory pricing scheme designed to lessen competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Fader also claims to have been slan dered by team
representatives who alleg edly referred to his publication as
``pornographic'' for carrying advertise ments from topless bars.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the lawsuit contends Fader should be able to sell Beat
on Baseball on the stadium plaza, which it says is public property.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Diamondbacks are in Cooperstown, N.Y., for
league meetings this week. I'm told they haven't yet seen the
lawsuit and, therefore, can't comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want any part of a court case,'' Fader says. `'But
this is really a matter of principle. And, luckily, I have the
resources to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He shouldn't. OUT-OF-STATE REVENUE
</P>
<P>
   On paper, Fader should have gone broke months ago. He would
have, too, if he hadn't done what all successful base ball
franchises do _ he developed a farm team.
</P>
<P>
   When the Seattle Mariners moved into the new stadium earlier
this season, Fader and his vendors were outside selling a $1
program called The Seattle Slugger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done very well in Seattle,'' Fader says. ``And because
of that, I'm able to pursue our case here in Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the lawsuit, Fader hopes to re cover the losses of the
past year, along with attorneys fees and punitive damages. Whether
any of that will happen is diffi cult to predict.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits aren't like baseball games. Since opening day in April,
the Diamond backs have slowly separated themselves from the rest of
their division by winning more games than the other guys.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the season winds down, fans are matching Diamondback
wins against rival losses, awaiting the point where a playoff spot
is guaranteed for the home team while the others are mathematically
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   That's the ``magic number'' baseball fans around Phoenix are
talking about.
</P>
<P>
   A lawsuit doesn't work that way.
</P>
<P>
   Several seasons can pass without it be ing resolved. And the
umpires (in black robes) can call the whole thing off at any time.
And victory isn't determined only by winning _ but by how much you
win.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is fine with Scott Fader.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't care which big gun the D-Backs hurl at him.
</P>
<P>
   Not as long as, in the end, the magic number is set by a jury.

CHURCH SHOOTINGS SEND SAD RIPPLES FAR AND WIDE

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Like a Biblical plague, the tragedy at
Wedgwood Baptist Church engulfed a community house by house.
</P>
<P>
   On a gorgeous late-summer night, there were soccer practices and
Little League games, dinners with friends and quiet nights with
families at home. The pulse of Fort Worth and its surrounding
suburbs beat quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the flash of a TV bulletin, a Texas county was plunged
into darkness, a collective anguish made worse by the fact that at
least some of the dead were young people and that they had died in
a church.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday night, even those who had no connection to the
church or the victims spoke of it in quiet voices, shaky with
shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very scary,'' J.J. Shorr said. ``It's very scary.''
</P>
<P>
   For her, as for most who saw the first bulletins on television,
the tragedy of Wedgwood Baptist dawned gradually. Shorr, 73, was
watching the news program ``Dateline'' when the local news broke
in.
</P>
<P>
   There was a shooting, but no news at first of fatalities. The
video was of wounded youngsters. Then there were reports that
teen-agers were dead, and of a deranged gunman who had killed
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Shorr's mind went immediately to her own church and the thriving
youth ministry there, and the nightly Boy Scout meetings, and the
doors that were never locked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would you ever lock a door in a church?'' she asked
slowly. ``That's what went through my mind. Oh, my heaven, our
children are in danger in the most protected place that God ever
made; his own home, but they come in and shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it ironic, she said, that in mass killings the last to die
is the killer, as if that act would somehow bring absolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing sacred,'' she said. ``You know how many good
sweet times you had in church, and to think that this had to
happen. It scares you to think that kids will have a different
feeling about going to church meetings and this type of thing. I'm
hoping there won't, but it's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hannan, coaching a youth soccer team, saw squad cars
speeding by while his team practiced in southwest Fort Worth. He
assumed the police were headed to a traffic accident. Not until
returning home did he learn otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   It was shocking and sad, he said. His two daughters, ages 9 and
7, were both aware of what had happened before going to bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to say to them,'' Hannan said. ``But
obviously, we want to keep them pretty close. It's just a reminder
of how important they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxine Harrington of Fort Worth first believed that the
shootings had happened in some other city. Then she heard the words
``Wedgwood Baptist Church,'' not far from her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goodness, here in Fort Worth, in a church of all places,'' she
said. ``You don't expect a metal detector in church. A church
should be a place open to everyone, not a place where you keep
people out.''
</P>
<P>
   At Rush Creek Christian Church in Arlington, a Fort Worth
suburb, relatives called to check on family members at the church
for Wednesday night choir practice, worried that the gunman might
have somehow escaped to continue his rampage in other sanctuaries.
</P>
<P>
   One member, Janice Lord, is a counselor who has specialized in
assisting crime victims. She has worked after tragedies across the
United States. But what happened Wednesday night much closer to
home seemed to overwhelm even her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel wasted,'' she said. ``You know you've done this a lot,
and you've seen it too much. On one hand, if there's something to
do tomorrow, I want to help. But there's another part of me that
says, `Oh my God, I hope no one calls me.' I don't want to go
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much pain,'' she added. ``This is just not 15 families in
crisis, or a Baptist church in crisis. It's a community in
crisis.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Seven-year-old Carly Fulbright fell asleep
in a chair in front of the TV set Wednesday night, her cheeks still
wet with tears, too afraid to go to bed alone.
</P>
<P>
   Less than three hours earlier, she'd run in terror from the
safest place she knew, her church home at Wedgwood Baptist, and
fell crying into her father's arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shot my choir director,'' she screamed. ``They killed my
choir director.''
</P>
<P>
   His voice still shaking with emotion, his face splashed
alternately with the red and blue lights of dozens of emergency
vehicles, Carly's father, George Fulbright, talked about the
moments just after a man walked into the church sanctuary and
opened fire with a heavy caliber automatic handgun. The man
reportedly emptied clip after clip into an unusually large
Wednesday evening crowd, bolstered by a concert celebrating ``See
You at the Pole'' festivities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my church,'' Fulbright said. ``This is my
neighborhood. And I'm mad as hell.''
</P>
<P>
   He has a right to be. We all do.
</P>
<P>
   When my television began relaying the tragic scene from south
Fort Worth Wednesday night, my heart sank.
</P>
<P>
   Not MY town, was my first thought. Oh God, not my town.
</P>
<P>
   How naive to think that somehow we might be immune to this
horrible sickness sweeping our country like a plague. How
incredibly blind.
</P>
<P>
   There are no safe havens any more. Not even a church. Perhaps
particularly not a church.
</P>
<P>
   Eyewitnesses interviewed on television said the gunman, who
ultimately took his own life, interacted with many of his victims,
arguing with them about religion before cutting them down with a
volley of shots.
</P>
<P>
   He killed seven and wounded another seven before shooting
himself.
</P>
<P>
   The gunshots, said Fran King, who was in a prayer meeting just
down the hall from the sanctuary, ``sounded like a hammer.''
</P>
<P>
   Then one of the victims staggered down the hall outside the
room, saying, ``I'm shot. I'm shot.''
</P>
<P>
   A block from the church two hours after the shooting Wednesday
night, Klieg lights lit the night sky and news helicopters circled
overhead. It was a scene eerily reminiscent of the last tragic news
story I'd been pressed into service to cover: the San
Francisco-Oakland earthquake that interrupted the World Series in
1987.
</P>
<P>
   A block away, inside the church sanctuary, a bomb squad robot
whirred around the body of the gunman, probing for a possible
explosive device. Police suspected that a pipe bomb had already
exploded in the balcony.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Gonzales was in her home at the corner of Walton and
Wales, talking on the phone, when she heard someone banging on the
front door and repeatedly ringing the doorbell.
</P>
<P>
   Afraid to open the door, she asked what the man wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call 911!'' he yelled. ``Someone's shooting at the church!''
</P>
<P>
   Unable to dial out on her regular phone for some reason, she
dialed 911 on her cell phone, then grabbed 10-year-old daughter
Victoria Rodriguez and pulled her into the hall, away from the
windows.
</P>
<P>
   Later, from her front yard, Margaret saw a teen-age boy fleeing
the church, his shirt wet with blood.
</P>
<P>
   Reponse from Fort Worth fire and police units was remarkably
fast, according to witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the sirens,'' said Fulbright, who lives at 5617 Wales.
``I came to the door and saw a police car come sliding up at the
corner. I knew my wife and my daughter were at the church and I
took off running.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were in a separate wing, away from the sanctuary, and I
met them coming out the door. We helped people coming out and got
them away from the church.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Fulbright who stepped out of a small crowd of onlookers
to question Fort Worth school Superintendent Dr. Thomas Tocco about
the availability of counseling for Bruce Shulkey Elementary School
students.
</P>
<P>
   Carly is a second-grader at Shulkey, which will be closed
Thursday because of its proximity to the crime scene. Shulkey
students will be divided among three other close-by elementary
schools and Dr. Tocco said psychologists and counselors will be
available for those who need them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carly was crying and carrying on a lot tonight,'' Fulbright
said. ``I just want to know that there'll be help for her
(Thursday) if she needs it. I want to know what they're going to do
about the school. These kids are traumatized. They're scared to
death.''
</P>
<P>
   In her chair at home, Carly slept on fitfully. My guess is that
George didn't sleep much at all.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _Fort Worth School Superintendent Thomas Tocco
has ordered Bruce Shulkey Elementary School closed Thursday because
of its proximity to Wedgwood Baptist Church, where investigators
continue probing why a gunman would turn a church sanctuary into a
killing field.
</P>
<P>
   Classes have not not been canceled elsewhere, and crisis teams
have been deployed to assist school leaders and teachers help
students cope with the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Police and city leaders said there will be a lot of activity at
Wedgwood Baptist, which is located at 5522 Whitman Ave. In
addition, there were unconfirmed reports of possible bomb devices
used in the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is too much going on in this area, and we do not want
these young children around for obvious reasons,'' Tocco said of
the students at Bruce Shulkey.
</P>
<P>
   Parents are being urged not to take their students to the
elementary school, which is across the street from the church, at
5533 Whitman Avenue. Instead, parents who are unable to provide
accommodations for their young children are being asked to take
them to one of three neighboring schools.
</P>
<P>
   School buses will be running as scheduled, Tocco said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly a tragic situation,'' Tocco said Wednesday
night. ``I think one teacher may have been killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Tocco said: ``We have gotten school counselors and psychologists
together and they will be available to help students try and
understand how to make sense of any of this.''
</P>
<P>
   A hot line has been established to assist parents. The number is
(817) 370-5850. Tocco asked parents to be patient.

MISSOURI HOUSE VOTES TO OVERRIDE CARNAHAN'S VETO OF ABORTION BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL SENTELL  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ The Missouri House voted Wednesday to
override Gov. Mel Carnahan's veto of an anti-abortion bill, setting
up a decisive, high-stakes battle today in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 127-34 to override Carnahan's veto while rival
partisans watched from packed galleries. The tally was 18 votes
more than the 109 required for the two-thirds majority required by
the state constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the bill still need two-thirds approval in the Senate
_ 23 votes _ for the bill to take effect despite the governor's
veto. It passed 27-6 in May.
</P>
<P>
   Only six vetoes have been overridden in state history.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after the House vote, Sen. Ted House, a St. Charles
Democrat and Senate sponsor, predicted the Senate override attempt
would benefit from the lopsided House vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very encouraging that virtually no one bought the
arguments by the abortion industry,'' House said. ``I expect the
same result in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Senate debate will last hours or days is unclear,
because earlier Senate debate on the bill lasted 38 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides on the issue have a huge investment in the outcome of
the Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters have invested several years on the issue and risk
losing momentum if they cannot override the veto.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Carnahan's gubernatorial prestige is on the
line. A defeat by a legislature controlled by his own party could
also be an issue in his U.S. Senate bid next year against
Republican incumbent John Ashcroft, an abortion opponent.
</P>
<P>
   While the House was debating the abortion bill and other
legislation, the Senate voted 24-8 to override the governor's veto
of a crime bill. The House declined to consider the issue, however,
and completed its work without voting to override any other vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the abortion measure say the bill would
criminalize a late-term abortion procedure that they describe as
``partial birth'' abortion by classifying it as infanticide. The
procedure would be a felony unless it was performed to save the
mother's life.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan, who contends that the bill is unconstitutional and
would result in abortion clinics closing in Missouri, told
reporters he was disappointed by the House vote but planned to work
hard to prevail in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan has said the bill would ban most abortions and could
provide a legal defense to anti-abortion violence.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has to persuade at least five senators who voted
for the bill in May to switch sides, a politically perilous move by
senators on such a closely watched issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have members to work with who think this is a bad
bill,'' he said. ``If I can convince them to vote the way they
think, I will be sustained.''
</P>
<P>
   In the House debate, Rep. Bill Luetkenhaus, a Josephville
Democrat and House sponsor, rebutted a variety of arguments put
forth by opponents of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Luetkenhaus noted that former Missouri Supreme Court Justices
John Bardgett and Chip Robertson wrote letters contradicting
assertions that the bill could provide a legal defense for
anti-abortion violence.
</P>
<P>
   He said officials of Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital in St.
Louis disputed arguments that the bill would complicate efforts to
save premature infants, another contention made by Carnahan and
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters overwhelmingly in this state want to ban partial
birth abortions,'' Luetkenhaus said. ``Let's listen to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Vicky Hartzler, a Harrisonville Republican, took issue with
comments by opponents of the bill who said it represented
government intrusion into the lives of women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government's role is to protect its most vulnerable,''
Hartzler told the House. ``That is what we are doing today.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the bill said that they wanted to ban ``partial
birth'' abortions but that the Luetkenhaus bill was riddled with
flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carol Jean Mays, an Independence Democrat, said that she
had what she called a compromise bill to ban such abortions and
that Carnahan would sign it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleading with all of you for a middle-of-the-road
philosophy,'' Mays said.
</P>
<P>
   Other opponents argued that the vetoed bill was designed to
overturn the 1973 decision that legalized abortions and that the
measure would trigger a costly court fight that ultimately would
result in the bill being struck down.
</P>
<P>
   Luetkenhaus said he welcomed getting the issue to the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should proceed, do the override and then let the judges
decide,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor told reporters that if the Senate sustained his
veto, he would call a special session to pass a new ban that would
allow the procedure to preserve the mother's health, not just her
life. Opponents of such a provision said it was too broad and would
be abused.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan said that, despite the lopsided House tally, at one
point in recent days he was within half a dozen votes of getting
his veto sustained in the House. But when it became obvious that
the veto could not be sustained, lawmakers who considered switching
sides voted for the override instead, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The override was backed by all 76 Republicans in the House, as
well as 50 of Carnahan's fellow Democrats and one independent.
Thirty-four Democrats voted against the override. One Democrat
voted ``present,'' and one was absent.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote followed nearly three hours of debate amid heavy
Capitol security, in part because the issue attracted huge public
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the bill, many wearing red and wearing ``Ban the
Brutality'' stickers, rallied on the south side of the Capitol to
blast Carnahan, denounce the abortion industry and vow to make the
override attempt a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Together we can move the mountains of injustice and evil,''
Sen. House told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Such comments won praise from supporters such as Mary Travis,
who was part of a church group from Harrisonville who attended the
rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this is murdering infants,'' Travis said of
``partial birth'' abortions. ``It needs to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Gus Kolilis, chief of the Capitol police, estimated that the
rally in support of the override attracted about 2,000 people.
Organizers said they had nearly 5,000 people at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, about 100 abortion-rights supporters gathered
briefly on the north side of the Capitol to hear speeches about the
what they called dangers in the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Boisseau, 79, said he came from the St. Louis suburb of
University City to let lawmakers know they were misinterpreting the
views of most Missourians.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very extreme bill,'' Boisseau said. ``It would ban
all abortions. The director of Planned Parenthood told us this
morning that if this goes through, they won't schedule abortions
until the law is set aside, because they want to avoid
prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the debate at the Capitol was trouble-free, Jefferson
City public schools were dismissed after a bomb threat was made,
citing Carnahan's opposition to the abortion bill.
</P>
<P>
   By the constitution, the veto session is limited to 10 days.

POLICE DETAINED SUSPECT WEEKS BEFORE WOMAN WAS KILLED, RECORDS
SHOW

<TEXT>
<P>
   Kansas City police had Michael L. Farris in jail last month for
a parking ticket days after he cut his electronic monitor and
jumped bond _ and weeks before he allegedly strangled a Kansas City
woman.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities freed Farris because state probation officials had
not told them that Farris had jumped bond. Even though probation
officials knew within hours on Aug. 9 that Farris had cut his
monitor, they took nearly a month to seek an arrest warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Without the warrant, police said, they had no way of knowing
that Farris was on the run.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County Circuit Judge John O'Malley, who oversees the
criminal docket, called the delay in the warrant request
``unconscionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Had a judge known quickly, a warrant would have been issued, he
said, and Farris would have been behind bars when Sophia Szymczak
was strangled.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just shouldn't have happened,'' said Leila Szymczak, the
victim's granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The state Board of Probation and Parole, which oversees the
pretrial program, operates under the Missouri Department of
Corrections. Tim Kniest, a spokesman for the department, said this
week that an extensive internal review process delayed the warrant
request. Kniest added Wednesday that the delay was not normal.
</P>
<P>
   Farris' case has reverberated in the county courthouse and the
Missouri Capitol. Officials want changes in the way probation
officers track defendants.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Farris' home detention, he was supposed to wear an
electronic monitor so officials could keep track of him.
</P>
<P>
   Farris, 44, of Independence, was to leave home only to go to
work while he awaited trial on a charge of burglarizing Szymczak's
Kansas City home in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Star reviewed court records and interviewed
police and court officials to reconstruct what happened:
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 9 probation officials noticed Farris had cut off the
monitor. The next day they found he had left his Independence home
and quit work.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later Independence police responded to a call about a
man sleeping in a vehicle. It was Farris. An officer ran a computer
check and found Farris had a Kansas City warrant for an unpaid
parking ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Independence police notified Kansas City police, who took Farris
to a downtown detention center that day.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 13 Farris was taken to the City Jail, where he spent the
weekend. On Aug. 16 a city judge released Farris, according to
court records. Jail records show he was released Aug. 17;
authorities could not explain the discrepancy.
</P>
<P>
   Through the entire process, authorities said they did not know
that Farris had jumped bond or that he was on home detention.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't enter it (in the computer), we have no way of
knowing,'' said Russ Dykstra, a Kansas City police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   If Independence police had known, Officer Bill Pross said, they
certainly would have held Farris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breaking home detention strikes me as a jailbreak,'' Pross
said. ``He just didn't have to saw through the bars.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 3, Szymczak, 76, was killed. She was to have testified
against Farris at his burglary trial set for Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Alfredo Arcaga, who shared a home with Szymczak, discovered her
body on the living room floor. He saw a man run out the back and
chased him more than a mile through afternoon traffic even after
the man had stabbed him.
</P>
<P>
   Police eventually arrested Farris. Prosecutors charged him with
first-degree murder and with assaulting Arcaga, and may seek the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 7, probation officials requested a warrant for Farris _
who was already in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The case has focused attention on the Board of Probation and
Parole. State Sen. Ronnie DePasco, a Kansas City Democrat, said he
would question the state probation chief about the Farris case.
</P>
<P>
   Corrections officials have started a new policy. They will
notify the court within three hours after a person cuts off a
monitor, he said. They are working with Jackson County officials on
other possible changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really want to solve this problem,'' Kniest said.
</P>
<P>
   Police want a change, too. The message to people on home
detention should be clear, Pross said: ``If you mess with this, you
will have your name put on a warrant so fast, you won't believe
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County Prosecutor Bob Beaird said the case showed ``how
critical it is to get those warrants out as fast as possible.''

`ACTION' IS RAUNCHY BUT
 HILARIOUS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients) 
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ 
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  PHOENIX - If you don't get cable, it's
safe to say you've never seen anything like Fox's Action!, which
premieres tonight.
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you do get cable, but only so you can watch the Disney
channel, it's safe to say you haven't seen anything like it,
either.
</P>
<P>
   The question is: Do you want to?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is somewhat compli cated. If bleeped-out cursing (not
just ``damns'' and ``hells,'' but the big guns _ we're talking
about several uses of the F-word before the first commercial),
fairly graphic ban ter about the size of male sexual organs and
jokes about urinating in commissary food put you off your oats, the
answer is no.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to be offended _ and by the way, some people
are, there's no question about it _ please don't watch,'' Doug
Herzog, the president for entertainment at Fox, told TV critics
this summer. ``Watch somebody else's network for that half-hour.
You know, we'd rather not field the phone calls and the e-mails and
the letters.''
</P>
<P>
   However, if hilarious, dead-on, ri otous Hollywood satire that
takes no prisoners appeals to you, then the answer is a resounding
yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to . . . remember that what we're trying to do is not
trying to make the most shocking show in television,'' said Chris
Thompson, who created Action! ``We're simply trying to make the
funniest show on television.''
</P>
<P>
   They've come mighty close.
</P>
<P>
   Action! concerns Peter Dragon, a producer of Hollywood action
films. His Christmas blockbuster, Slow Tor ture, is fizzling,
jeopardizing the chances of the sequel he so badly wants to make.
Naturally, he's started work on it before the first movie has even
opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``What title do you like better,'' Dragon asks an underling,
``Slow Torture 2: It Still Hurts or Slow Torture 2: Now It's
Unbearable?''
</P>
<P>
   Dragon picks up a prostitute on the way to Slow Torture's
premiere _ literally, his limo picks her up off the ground _ who
turns out to be the only person in town he can trust. Meanwhile, he
has bought the wrong script from the wrong writer, his ex-wife is a
beard for his gay boss and an agent is trying to pitch him an actor
so famous ``little children in Calcutta know his face,'' someone
more famous than Tom Hanks.
</P>
<P>
   O.J. Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be fair,'' Dragon says, ``Tom Hanks refuses to go that
extra mile and hack his wife to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Mohr, Tom Cruise's oily rival agent in Jerry Maguire, is
brilliant as Dragon; he's born to this kind of role. Illeana
Douglas is also good as the child-actor-turned-prostitute, Wendy
Ward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every boy in America dreamed of being with Wendy Ward,'' a
Bruce-Willis-type action star says when he realizes who she is.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now that dream has almost come true,'' Dragon's security
man says.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, about that security man _ he answers the Hollywood trivia
ques tion, ``Is Buddy Hackett dead?''
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   The season will follow the progress of the movie Dragon makes
next (chosen by Ward from a stack of scripts left on his kitchen
table). Look for several celebrity cameos _ tonight's is Keanau
Reeves, who during the premiere receives a, um, how to put it,
special gift from Ward. It's neither Goobers nor Raisinettes.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson doesn't plan to water things down as the season goes on
_ if anything, look for him to push the edge even farther. But he
insists he's being realistic, not gratuitous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an advocate of the coarsen ing of the culture,'' he
said. ``I'm not an advocate of any of the behavior that's displayed
in this show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an observer of it. I am a chronicler of it. And I believe
that it can be made to be entertaining.''
</P>
<P>
   If the first episode is any indication, he's right.

FAMILY FROM INDIA BIKING AROUND WORLD TO PROMOTE NONVIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIANXIANG YANG  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like Mahatma Gandhi, Rajpal Singh embraces the credo of
nonviolence. And he's spreading that message around the world _ by
bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   After four years of preparation, Singh left his home in Jaipur,
India, on Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
   At every stop on his two-year journey, Singh talks about
nonviolence, the sharing of resources and peace.
</P>
<P>
   Singh, his wife and their 8-year-old daughter arrived Tuesday in
Kansas City. He was to speak at a coffeehouse Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, Singh said people ``should seek
nonviolent approaches and influence their leaders to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh, 41, a veteran cyclist, had made three long tours in his
own country before embarking on his around-the-globe trip.
</P>
<P>
   He pedaled alone in Bangladesh, Singapore and Indonesia. His
wife, Hamsavahini, and their daughter, Aditya, joined him in
Malaysia. The Singhs arrived in San Francisco on July 2 on a flight
from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   While in Kansas City, the Singhs are staying with Lynn and Chris
Cheatum. They serve as hosts for Servas, an international
cooperative system which promotes global understanding by opening
people's homes to travelers. The Singhs have stayed with Servas
hosts and in churches on their journey.
</P>
<P>
   Singh secured the sponsorship of some Indian companies for his
world trip. Companies and institutions also have paid for airline
flights. Apart from a few flat tires, which Singh fixed himself,
the cost of the trip has been small, Singh said.
</P>
<P>
   In Boulder, Colo., at a farmers market where Singh hung his
posters promoting peace and nonviolence, a man offered a tandem
bike for his Indian-made bike. The new bike afforded a more
comfortable ride for Aditya.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can people be so friendly?'' Singh asked.
</P>
<P>
   He concluded that people everywhere were basically kind.
</P>
<P>
   Aditya has just completed the third grade. During the journey,
her parents have been teaching her themselves. Hamsavahini Singh is
an assistant professor at an Indian university. Rajpal Singh works
for a city government.
</P>
<P>
   The Singhs will leave Kansas City on Friday. The next country
they plan to visit is South Africa, where ``we will trace the route
(along which) Gandhi led the march of demonstration against social
apartheid,'' Singh said.
</P>
<P>
   From South Africa, the Singhs will go to Portugal and tour
western and central Europe. Next June, Hamsavahini Singh and Aditya
will return to India. Singh will to keep pedaling through Poland,
Russia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Iran and Pakistan before
reuniting with his family in spring 2001.

GATES' TO ANNOUNCE $1 BILLION SCHOLARSHIP FUND FOR MINORITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH SCHUBERT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates and his wife, Melinda, will
announce on Thursday that they are giving at least $1 billion to a
new scholarship fund to help minority students pay for college.
</P>
<P>
   The gift dwarfs previous giving by the 5-year-old Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation and is only the second billion-dollar
bequest to a single cause. The first was a $1 billion gift from Ted
Turner to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Gates Foundation, which has assets of more
than $17 billion, refused to discuss the initiative on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But sources said the new minority scholarship program would
support a minimum of 1,000 high school students throughout their
undergraduate and graduate studies. Awards would cover tuition,
room and board and other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``That certainly is a very significant grant if that's the
case,'' said Dorothy Ridings, president of the Council on
Foundations, a Washington, D.C.-based group that serves
foundations. ``It's an interesting approach because it's not for
bricks and mortar but for actual programmatic activity through
scholarships.''
</P>
<P>
   The program, called the Gates Millennium Scholarships, will be
open to all racial minorities, but will be aimed particularly at
black, Hispanic and American Indian students.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of the scholarship program comes less than a year
after voters in Washington state passed Initiative 200, outlawing
the consideration of race in university admissions and some
scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Washington, the immediate effects of I-200
have caused alarm as minority enrollments have plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the UW is expecting 40 percent fewer African American
freshmen, 30 percent fewer Latino and 20 percent fewer Native
American freshman than registered for classes last fall. If the
numbers hold, the three minority groups will make up only 5 percent
of the 1999 entering class.
</P>
<P>
   William H. Gates Jr. _ father of the Microsoft co-founder,
co-chairman of the Gates Foundation and a member of the UW Board of
Regents _ has been an outspoken opponent of I-200.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he donated $25,000 to the campaign to defeat the
initiative. And as a member of the UW's board, he has been
instrumental in crafting outreach and recruitment programs designed
to keep the university's doors open for minority students.
</P>
<P>
   That task has been made more difficult because the rollback of
affirmative action programs has meant public money can't be used to
attract and support minority students.
</P>
<P>
   Washington isn't the only state grappling with this issue.
California voted to outlaw affirmative action programs at it's
public universities in 1996. The same year, a federal appeals court
ruled that the University of Texas' use of race in admissions
decisions was unconstitutional. And efforts to roll back
affirmative action programs are under way now in Florida and
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   As more states outlaw affirmative action programs using public
money, the Millenium Scholarship Program would fill the void by
privately financing college educations for minority students.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter inviting presidents of area universities to Thursday
morning's news conference, Foundation co-chair Patty Stonesifer
wrote, ``I welcome you to learn about our new national program
dedicated to improving equity and access to higher education.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the program will benefit promising students who are
already in college. Beginning in the fall of 2000, it will be
opened to high school seniors. The applicants must have a 3.3
grade-point average, be nominated by a teacher or their school's
principal and must also write an essay.
</P>
<P>
   For those selected, the Gates Foundation will bridge the gap
between the total cost of school and any other scholarship the
students are receiving.
</P>
<P>
   That difference is key to many students.
</P>
<P>
   Melinda and Bill Gates, his father, Gov. Gary Locke and the
presidents of several area universities are scheduled to be present
for Thursday morning's announcement at the Foundation's Seattle
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is the umbrella
organization for the Gates' philanthropic work. It is presently the
largest philanthropic foundation in the United States and may soon
become the largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Foundation focuses on global health and learning. A
statement on the organization's Web site talks about the founders'
goals: ``Too many people are denied access to the remarkable
advances of the 21st century in the areas of global health and
learning. Bill and Melinda are committed to bridging the gap in
access for all people.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent gifts in education include a $200 million commitment to
bring computers, Internet access and training to low-income
libraries in the United States and Canada. To date, approximately
$30 million in grants have been distributed under this initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The Gateses have awarded smaller gifts to higher education to
finance a variety of programs. Heritage College in Toppenish,
Wash., received $200,000 to automate the library for Internet
access. The United Negro College Fund received $100,000. The
University of Puget Sound received $1 million to renovate the
Collins Memorial Library.
</P>
<P>
   The $1 billion gift being announced Thursday is remarkable not
only for its scale, but for its scope, philanthropy experts said.

SIERRA CLUB DENOUNCES STATE AID TO CORPORATE HOG FARMS IN
MISSOURI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An environmental group on Wednesday criticized the use of
economic development money to draw large corporate hog farms to
Missouri, creating pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governments are spending millions of taxpayer dollars to bring
a pollution nightmare into America's neighborhoods,'' said Ken
Midkiff, director of the Sierra Club in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   State officials and hog farm operators disputed the findings,
saying that the economic development programs were creating jobs in
depressed rural areas and that pollution concerns were being
addressed.
</P>
<P>
   In their report, ``Corporate Hogs at the Public Trough,'' the
Sierra Club questioned the amount of government economic incentives
that went to companies operating huge hog and poultry farms.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri the Sierra Club report focused on Premium Standard
Farms, the Kansas City-based company that raises more than 2
million hogs a year across the state's northern tier of counties.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club said that more than $1.5 million from Missouri's
Department of Economic Development had gone to Premium Standard
Farms, as well as tax abatements that can extend for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Sierra Club report, officials in Sullivan
County granted the company a 100 percent tax abatement on its
packing plant for 18 years. And in north Missouri, an electric
company provides Premium Standard power at about one-third the
normal cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``This money is not creating economic development _ it's
creating environmental destruction,'' Midkiff said. ``Instead of
holding these polluters accountable for polluting our water and
air, governments are offering these factories tax breaks, direct
and indirect subsidies, and even outright cash outlays.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Arnot, a spokesman for Premium Standard, disagreed with
the club's criticism of state economic incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Premium Standard Farms has never asked for or received
anything that wasn't available to any other industry creating
jobs,'' Arnot said Wednesday. ``We have never asked for special
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Premium Standard employs 2,200 people in northern Missouri, has
a $56 million annual payroll, and pays about $2 million in taxes a
year, Arnot added.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, Arnot said, Premium Standard also had
worked to improve pollution controls. He said Premium Standard had
aggressively pursued pilot programs for waste treatment that would
help reduce the risk of spills.
</P>
<P>
   Premium Standard also has been instrumental to the economic
turnaround in the areas where they locate, said Jim Gardner, a
spokesman for the state's Department of Economic Development.
</P>
<P>
   ``After decades of population decline, now Sullivan County is
one of the fastest-growing communities in the state,'' Gardner
said. ``A lot of that is due to that solid economic base provided
by these companies.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Sierra Club maintains that the economy has not improved
in north Missouri with the introduction of corporate hog farms. The
club found that Putnam County's unemployment rate has gone up,
while per capita income in Mercer County has dipped below its 1994
level, ranking next to last in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club said it found similar patterns in Kentucky,
Utah, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Arkansas, Oklahoma, North Carolina
and Mississippi.

 FREDERICK ROSE, 75, BUILDER AND PHILANTHROPIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frederick Rose, a highly successful builder who poured his
energy into two dozen major apartment projects and an equal number
of institutions that adorn the New York skyline, from Lincoln
Center to Rockefeller University and the Children's Aid Society,
died Tuesday night. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   He died at his home in Rye, N.Y., after a brief illness, his
family said.
</P>
<P>
   A second-generation member of a New York real estate dynasty,
Rose could be found until earlier this year supervising
construction of a 50-story apartment house, the Belvedere, at 29th
Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest project for Rose Associates, which owns or
manages 12,000 apartments in New York and 4 million square feet of
commercial space.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, and with equal enthusiasm, he was overseeing
construction of the $150 million Frederick Phineas and Sandra
Priest Rose Center for Earth and Space at the American Museum of
Natural History, the giant sphere that houses the new Hayden
Planetarium. Rose not only wrote a $20 million check for the
planetarium, but also was the project leader for the trustees.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a builder in every sense of the word, not just of
buildings, but of institutions,'' said Ellen Futter, president of
the American Museum of Natural History.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Rose also gave $5 million to the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, $15 million to the New York Public Library and $18
million to Lincoln Center, more than $95 million in all.
</P>
<P>
   A forceful man with a reputation for keeping his word, Rose
could breeze into a meeting, as he did earlier this year with his
longtime friend and partner, Charles Benenson, and within minutes
size up the situation and agree to a $24 million real estate deal
for land on 44th Street, near Third Avenue, for a 51-story
apartment house.
</P>
<P>
   Rose was still building tall buildings while his nephew, Joseph
Rose, the current chairman of the New York City Planning
Commission, labored to change the zoning laws to bar oversized
towers in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Rose family's buildings were known more for
efficiency than architectural detail, Rose was most proud of
building two towers that won awards for design: the Bankers Trust
Building at 280 Park Ave., near 48th Street, and a 40-story
apartment house at 45 E. 89th St.
</P>
<P>
   His interests ranged widely.
</P>
<P>
   Rose always carried a stack of foreign currency and American
dollar bills, which he would fold into intricate origami figures of
birds, cows and walruses and present to his delighted friends. At
the end of a stuffy board meeting at Lincoln Center, Rose would
often stroll over to a piano and play a few songs for the amusement
of the other directors. He played golf up to four times a week and,
last year, hired a national chess champion to sharpen his skills.
</P>
<P>
   Benenson, who had been a partner in many of Rose's real estate
deals since the early 1960s, said he called his friend two months
ago, suggesting that they raise $100,000 from each of 10 people for
the refugees in Kosovo. The next day, Benenson recalled, the
developer called back and said, ``OK, we'll do it through the
American Jewish Committee, because we want to show the world that
Jewish people are helping Muslims.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Two or three days later,'' Benenson concluded, ``we had $1.4
million. An engineer by training, Rose wrote in a 1994 journal
commemorating the 50th anniversary of his graduation from Yale
University that the central focus of his life had been his family.
He wrote that he had been on the boards of 35 organizations, from
Con Edison to Yale University. He took pride in being a builder.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he wrote: ``I don't read trash, watch TV or have an
interest in spectator sports. This leaves time for active
participation in things I enjoy: music, chess, tennis, golf,
travel, skiing and friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose's insistence on providing advice and hiring consultants for
projects to which he had contributed sometimes rankled other
developers, but institutions and their directors embraced him.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Rose was chairman of the real estate company
started by his father, Samuel Rose, and his uncle, David Rose, in
the Bronx around the time he was born, in 1923. The two brothers
built small apartment houses in the Bronx before moving into
Manhattan a decade later. Samuel had three sons, Daniel, Elihu and
Frederick, all of whom joined the company after World War II.
Frederick's son Adam, is now president of Rose Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Rose married his teen-age sweetheart, Sandra Priest of Rye, in
the early 1940s. She survives him, along with a daughter, Deborah
Rose; two sons, Jonathan Rose and Adam Rose, both of New York; two
brothers, Daniel and Elihu, and three grandchildren, Ariel, Rachael
and Sarah.
</P>
<P>
   Rose served in the construction battalions of the Navy Seabees
during World War II, rising to the rank of lieutenant before he
returned to New York and Rose Associates. He took charge of design
and construction, while Daniel did the planning and finances and
Elihu took over management of the family's apartment houses.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rose built more than 2,000 units of middle-income housing under
the state's Mitchell-Lama program, as well as the family's first
office tower at 280 Park Ave.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike some developers who showed up in the gossip columns
during the 1980s and 1990s, Rose and his family avoided publicity.
He usually contributed money to charities anonymously, and word of
the donations rarely leaked out until years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``He built good-quality housing and he was devoted to community
service,'' said Robert Shapiro, a real estate broker who knew Rose.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime opponent of rent control, Rose converted more than
3,000 apartments in Manhattan during the early 1990s into
condominiums and co-ops. Many people in the industry thought it was
a risky move, given the recession. But unlike many landlords at the
time who were struggling with enormous loans, the Rose family had
buildings that were largely free of debt, and the conversion went
off without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He secretly believed he was the finest construction
superintendent in the city,'' said his brother Daniel, who is now
chairman of Rose Associates. ``He liked to kick the bricks.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose applied the same energy, enthusiasm and discipline to his
philanthropic work as his professional work, his brother said. When
Rose, along with his wife, gave $15 million to Lincoln Center, he
also helped engineer the construction of the Rose Building, a
31-story tower that houses rehearsal space and dormitories for the
Juilliard School of Music and offices for the School of American
Ballet and the New York Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a mercurial mind and it was fun trying to keep up with
him,'' said Beverly Sills, the chairwoman of Lincoln Center. ``He
was a man of the world in every sense of the word. I'm really going
to miss him.''

OSUNA'S SURGERY LEAVES ANOTHER GAP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers finally got their way when
right-hander Antonio Osuna succumbed to the pain in his pitching
elbow and agreed to have ``Tommy John'' surgery today, but it
doesn't help their situation next season.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a complementary set-up man to Alan Mills plagued the
Dodgers all season. Osuna was supposed to fill that role. And now
with Osuna out for approximately a year, it means the Dodgers must
fill the void with someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bullpen is something we want to improve on,'' Dodgers
general manager Kevin Malone said. ``I'm not saying the bullpen is
our only problem. For a long stretch of the season, the bullpen was
pitching well.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding another set-up man is paramount to the success of a
bullpen, not to mention the team. It's the formula the Yankees used
in winning the World Series when they used their bullpen to shorten
games to six or seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Dodgers used a mix-and-match of six rookies out
of the bullpen this season. That put an enormous burden on Mills
and lefty Pedro Borbon. The two are tops in games pitched on the
club at 62 and 64, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen also entered Wednesday's game against Montreal with
a league-worst 12 wins against 21 losses. They had a combined 4.01
ERA. Their last win was Aug. 20, when Mills was the winner at
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another role we have to fill, but we like the way
Matt Herges has been throwing,'' Malone said. ``We're going to look
to shore up the bullpen, but I think Herges has opened some eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Not in job description: In Kevin Brown's last two starts, the
Dodgers have been outscored 6-1, had three hits and gone through
stretches of having 16 straight retired against the Mets and 17
consecutive batters set down by 23-year-old Montreal righty Javier
Vazquez.
</P>
<P>
   After Vazquez one-hit the Dodgers on Tuesday, Brown was asked if
the Dodgers had the right approach at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they make me the hitting coach, I'll worry about it
then,'' Brown said. ``Until then, I'll do my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Just so you know, Brown is 5 for 73 (.068) with two RBI this
season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Batten down the hatches: When Hurricane Georges rolled
through the Dominican Republic last summer, the Dodgers' Campos Las
Palmas took an enormous hit. There was substantial damage. The
complex braced for Hurricane Floyd this week but was spared when
nature's fury took a turn away from the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   According to Geudy Guerrero, a security guard at Campos Las
Palmas, rain fell at the complex, but there was no damage. ``This
hurricane was far away from the coast, it was nothing in comparison
to Georges,'' Guerrero said.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Floyd also forced the closing of Dodgertown,
spring-training home of the Dodgers, in Vero Beach, Fla. There was
no word from the Dodgers on whether the storm did any damage, but
reports said the Florida coastline didn't take a direct hit and
serious damage was avoided.
</P>
<P>
   __ FYI: Triple-A catcher Hector Ortiz is with the Dodgers in
case of an emergency. Teams usually call up a third catcher for
September in case of injury. But the Dodgers won't activate Ortiz
unless either Todd Hundley or Paul LoDuca are hurt because Ortiz
isn't on the 40-man roster. . . . Manny Mota was honored before the
game for 30 years of service to the Dodgers organization.

MOTHER'S NIGHTMARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSIE STECKNER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Kahalani Drew loves her son, Keala, a brown-haired
5-year-old who likes to draw pictures and play in the park.
</P>
<P>
   She just hopes he won't kill her in her sleep.
</P>
<P>
   She and Keala's psychiatrist also hope the Valley's public
mental health system will relent and provide the sick child the
help they think he needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are more concerned about their pocketbook,'' Drew
said.
</P>
<P>
   Drew, 29, is concerned about Keala, whose serious mental illness
has made him capable of sudden violence that would be shocking in a
youth three times his age.
</P>
<P>
   Violence sometimes urged on him by voices he calls ``the boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Keala has killed several pets, stabbed his mother, leaped from
moving cars, slashed the top of his thumb and been in and out of
six hospitals and clinics in eight months.
</P>
<P>
   He once ripped the leg off a rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   Drew, a jail detention officer, points to areas of her body _ a
puncture wound here from a pencil, a stab mark there from a fork, a
bite mark, a knife cut, the endless bruises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know as a parent if I'm going to live or die,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Keala was hospitalized for his thumb. Dr. Manuel
Mota, the psychiatrist who diagnosed him with bipolar disorder,
asked that the boy be hospitalized for three weeks of psychiatric
care.
</P>
<P>
   The request was denied by Value Options, the firm that contracts
with the state to provide mental health services for the Valley's
poor and uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials declined to comment on the case, citing
patient confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harold Levine, medical director for Value Options'
subsidiary, ABS, said that in recent years psychiatrists have
diagnosed increasing numbers of children with bipolar psychosis.
Levine said they can be treated successfully with medication, and
it's unusual for them to be violent.
</P>
<P>
   Mota said Value Options officials decided that Keala's symptoms
weren't severe enough to warrant more than five days at the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   And as for his history?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the scary part,'' Mota said. ``They are expecting him
to show more severe symptoms, and those are severe symptoms that
could cause serious harm to somebody.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unpredictable. It's like walking into a minefield.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of Keala's continuing search for help isn't an
unfamiliar one. Keala is one of 10,000 children receiving mental
health services, from medication to long-term hospitalization,
through Value Options.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, critics say, they are not getting the help they
need.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants to pay for treating these children,'' Mota said.
``Between CPS (Child Protective Services), DDD (Developmentally
Disabled), Value Options and private payers, a lot of these
children just fall through the cracks.''
</P>
<P>
   But even when some help is available, as in Keala's case, many
patients' doctors and relatives say it is often not enough help or
not long enough.
</P>
<P>
   Drew, a single mother, has insurance through her job. But her
mental health benefits were wiped out with Keala's first three
hospital stays.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, three of the boy's medications are paid for by the
Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System, the state's Medicaid
system. The other two are covered by Drew's insurance, as are his
thrice-daily breathing treatments for asthma and his daily allergy
medication.
</P>
<P>
   For Drew, ``every day is a hurdle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't know if it's going to be a speed bump or if it's
going to be a total 10-foot wall that I have to climb over.''
</P>
<P>
   Mota calls Keala's self-mutilation of his thumb a ``red flag.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be careful with this kid,'' he said. ``Maybe on
another day . . . he'll decide to stab his mother while she
sleeps.''
</P>
<P>
   Keala was different almost from the start of his young life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would be sitting, playing, content and happy like any
little kid would be,'' Drew said. ``And then he would start
screaming, bloodcurdling screams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would check him, check his pants, do everything a mom does
and nothing would be wrong. Then I'd hold him, cuddle him and sing
to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The lyrics from a favorite family song, I Do Believe the Lord
Above, would finally soothe the toddler.
</P>
<P>
   Problems persisted. He screamed when looking in the mirror and
tied things around his neck, pulling them tight.
</P>
<P>
   Mota says the boy suffers from a bipolar disorder with psychotic
features like hallucinating and hearing the voices of ``the boys,''
a group who Keala says tells him to do harmful things.
</P>
<P>
   Mota caught one such episode on videotape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recorded him talking to the boys,'' he said. ``Five boys
were talking to him and telling him to be mean and hit his
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of this year, Drew said, her son chased her with a
large kitchen knife. She said she usually keeps the house carefully
secured, using duct tape to seal off cabinets and drawers and
keeping doors shut with latches. But the knife was in the
dishwasher.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't harmed, and later took him for hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   The voices also tell Keala to threaten others.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll tell his therapist, `I'm going to kill you, bitch,' ''
she said. ``He says a lot of things, but he doesn't have the
physical strength to do them.''
</P>
<P>
   But he has killed several animals, Drew said. He can be gentle
with them one moment and violent the next.
</P>
<P>
   He killed a rabbit by snapping its neck, crushed a small turtle
with his foot and strangled a cat with its leash.
</P>
<P>
   He also ripped the leg off another rabbit because it turned its
head away from him, Drew said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just started laughing,'' she said. ``He said (to the
rabbit), `You don't do that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Drew and her son live on her $21,000-a-year salary, supplemented
by a monthly $160 from Social Security. She said she receives no
child support from her ex-husband.
</P>
<P>
   The two were evicted from their Phoenix apartment because, Drew
said, she was late with rent payments.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they live with friends in the Valley, and she pays a
monthly $300 rent. She's looking for a home of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Drew said she had to trade in her four-door car for a minivan
because Keala kept leaping out while she drove _ once in the
carpool lane of Interstate 10 _ or attacking her from behind.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's strapped into a heavy-duty child-restraint seat in the
rear of the minivan, with no quick access to a door. Because the
van is a three-seater, there's a buffer between him and her.
</P>
<P>
   Since February, Keala has been admitted to a hospital or an
urgent-care center six times; his stays have varied from one night
to just over a month.
</P>
<P>
   Then, earlier this month, the voices told him to cut off the end
of his thumb and try to ``eat'' the blood, Drew said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy didn't seem to mind the pain and blood. That day, like
so many others, he just wore what Drew calls a distant and
disturbing stare.
</P>
<P>
   He stayed one night at an urgent-care center and then received
five days of psychiatric care at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Officials noted that Keala suffered from ``aggression, violent
outbursts, self-destruction and auditory hallucinations,''
according to records. He received counseling and therapy, was
deemed ``stable'' and discharged Sept. 8 because of the Value
Options denial.
</P>
<P>
   Both Drew and Mota believe Keala is stable, for now, but also
believe that Keala warrants further hospitalization or professional
care in his own home. But, as Drew notes, that stability changes
from on and off like a light switch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says, `I want people to love me,' '' Drew said. `` `Why are
you scared? I'm a nice boy.' '' &QL;

 By BILL SULLIVAN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
It pained him to say it. He smacked his lips and squirmed for just
an instant, but the words eventually came out.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I think he did a super job last year of keeping his team into
it mentally,'' Florida coach Steve Spurrier said. ``Sometimes you
go 9-0, 10-0, 11-0, you tend to get a little full of yourself. They
seemed to stay on an even keel throughout the run they had last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil and his coaches had a good year.''
</P>
<P>
   So there you have it: If a national championship and a Knoxville
street named in his honor weren't enough to cap off a remarkable
1998 season, even Phillip Fulmer's favorite tormentor was tossing
compliments his way.
</P>
<P>
   Now, all folks in Tennessee want is for Fulmer and the
Volunteers to do it again _ with Saturday night's game at Florida
serving as the first big step on the way to the Sugar Bowl, site of
this year's Bowl Championship Series-designated national title
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You consistently raise the bar,'' Fulmer said. ``I like the
expectations. Kids work with those things in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us like it when you don't quite get it all done and
you get talked about and criticized.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer heard plenty of that when talented Tennessee teams came
up short in all four seasons of Peyton Manning's record-setting
career. From 1993 to 1997, in fact, the Vols lost five straight to
the rival Gators, with the loquacious Spurrier usually ready to
apply the needle.
</P>
<P>
   Things are different now after a 13-0 season ended in a Fiesta
Bowl win over Florida State, wrapping up Tennessee's first national
championship since 1951. And while Fulmer isn't likely to be caught
resting on his laurels, those close to him have seen a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it gave him the recognition he deserved,'' quarterback
Tee Martin says. ``He's mentioned now among the elite coaches in
college football, the Bobby Bowdens and Tom Osbornes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He already had one of the biggest winning percentages in
college football. Winning the national championship got him over
the hump.''
</P>
<P>
   Since taking over in 1992, Fulmer has compiled a record of
68-11, including this year's opening win over Wyoming. That .860
winning percentage is better than that of any other active coach.
</P>
<P>
   Until last season, though, he also carried the tag of a coach
who couldn't win the big one, even with some of the nation's top
talent. The losses to Florida were particularly damaging, but the
Vols finally broke through with a 20-17 overtime victory in
Knoxville.
</P>
<P>
   After beating Bowden and Florida State in the Fiesta Bowl,
Fulmer was voted Coach of the Year by his peers. As the 1999 season
got under way, critics were few and apologies were unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I feel validated rather than vindicated,'' Fulmer
says. ``You try to stay the course and look at your program and all
those things that give you a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go on forever and not win a national championship.
We've been awfully close and not been recognized as much as some of
our kids should have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad to get over that hurdle.''
</P>
<P>
   For his next trick, he will attempt to produce Tennessee's first
win in Gainesville since 1971. And oh, yes, a repeat of
Southeastern Conference and national titles would be nice, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a professional standpoint, last year was the pinnacle,''
Fulmer said. ``But it's not like you won the lottery and you
retire. You have to go about your business.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night's visit to ``The Swamp'' is the next big item on
the agenda. If the Vols can clear that hurdle, the schedule becomes
an ally with only trips to Alabama (Oct. 23) and Arkansas (Nov. 13)
looming as potential stumbling blocks. (Georgia and Notre Dame
visit Knoxville.)
</P>
<P>
   With a return to Tennessee's house of horrors coming up fast,
Fulmer is well aware that the time for basking in January's glories
has passed. While even Spurrier is willing to give last year's
winner his due, things can change quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Driving by ``Phillip Fulmer Way'' on the Knoxville campus, he
says, is a regular reminder of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a great honor,'' the honoree said. ``From the
standpoint of recognition, that's as good as it gets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, they may take it down if I don't do well.''

FRIENDS RECALL VICTIMS OF CHURCH SHOOTINGS

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Justin Stegner was a high school senior and
an only child, described by a friend as ``just the nicest and
sweetest guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydney Rochelle Browning was the 36-year-old director of the
children's choir at Wedgwood Baptist Church and was apparently the
first person to encounter a gunman who opened fire at the church
about 7 p.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman, described by police only as a white man in his 30s,
killed Stegner and Browning and several others before turning the
gun on himself. The apparently random shooting transformed what was
intended as a hope-filled gathering of young people into a scene of
horror.
</P>
<P>
   Stegner and about 150 other teen-agers were attending weekly
services at the red-brick Baptist church in an older neighborhood
of modest brick homes in southwest Fort Worth. Many of the teens
had attended ``See You At the Pole'' ceremonies Wednesday morning
at their schools.
</P>
<P>
   The annual ceremonies, at which students affirm their faith and
concern for the problems of society by holding prayer time around
their schools' flagpoles, began in 1990 as an effort of the Texas
Baptist Convention. The event takes place on the third Wednesday of
September.
</P>
<P>
   Tamra Hernandez, 35, and her husband, Marcelo, are volunteer
Sunday school teachers at the Wedgwood church. They and their
7-year-old son, David, were at the church when the shooting began.
Browning was David's choir teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the prayer meeting that was around the corner from
the sanctuary,'' Tamra Hernandez said. ``We heard shots ... we
thought they were hammering on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of construction at the church. But one of the
men who was shot came down the hallway. He said he was shot, that
he wasn't joking _ that he was shot. I'm in shock. Just realizing
that someone had been shooting in our church and people were hurt.
And you realize they're people you know.''
</P>
<P>
   David was upstairs when the shooting broke out, his mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Several young people who were in the sanctuary when the gunman
walked in said that Browning casually greeted the man and that he
shot her in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Among the wounded were Jeff Lester, a student at Southwestern
Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth and a custodian at the
church; Mary Beth Talley, a senior at Southwest High School; Matt
Parr, a junior at Southwest, who is also a kicker on the football
team; Nick Skinner; Cassie Griffith; and Kevin Galey.
</P>
<P>
   Galey and his wife, Leslie, are parents of three children,
including a baby born last year after experimental surgery in the
womb to correct spina bifida. The family's decision to risk the
surgery was chronicled in stories in the Star-Telegram last year.
</P>
<P>
   Rachal Shipp, 18, a senior at the private West Academy, called
Justin Stegner ``just the nicest and sweetest guy.'' Stegner
attended Southwest High School last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so short and so animated,'' Shipp said. ``He was nice
and lively. Everybody liked him. Oh, I can't believe this. He just
liked talking to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Talley, Shipp said: ``Mary Beth has a beautiful voice. She
has always been really into this church. She is a straight-A
student.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends of the teen-agers who were attending Youth Night at the
church went to Bruce Shulkey Elementary to check on whether their
peers had been hurt, Shipp said.
</P>
<P>
   Shipp, who stood crying outside the elementary school, said she
spent most of her high school years at Southwest High School, where
most of the victims were students.
</P>
<P>
   Shipp said her friend, Kristy Martin, was inside the church
sitting on a sofa near the door while several students milled
around waiting for the program to begin. The gunman, smoking a
cigarette, walked in and opened fire, she said.

GUNMAN INVADES CHURCH, KILLS 7 THEN HIMSELF, POLICE SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERNIE MAKOVY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A long-haired, mustachioed man dressed in
black, spouting obscenities and demeaning Baptists for their
religious beliefs, invaded a Wednesday night church service and
opened fired randomly, fatally shooting at least seven people,
wounding seven others and then killing himself.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting is believed to be the deadliest in the city's
history, surpassing an onslaught that killed five people and
wounded four at the Glass Key cafe near downtown in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the victims were teen-agers attending a concert by Forty
Days, a Dallas Christian rock group, as part of the annual ``See
You at the Pole'' prayer ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Seven victims, including the gunman, a white man about
35-years-old, were pronounced dead at the scene. One died at a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman, whose identity was unknown last night, also
detonated an explosive device in the balcony at Wedgwood Baptist
Church, 5512 Whitman Ave., before turning his weapon on himself in
front of more than 200 worshippers, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Two guns, one a large caliber, were recovered from the scene,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman's body remained in the church late Wednesday night
and police had not searched it for fear that it had been rigged
with boobytraps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to be a bulge in the pocket of the jacket he is
wearing,'' Fire Chief Larry McMillen said. ``It's very
suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the victims' bodies had been removed by 11:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was inside, but it's not something I want to describe,''
McMillen said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents and bomb-sniffing
dogs joined Fort Worth police in the investigation after several
other potentially explosive devices were found in the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's cartridges, shrapnel, empty cartridge boxes and blood
splattered on the wall,'' said Lt. David Ellis, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said investigators and bomb squad members were examining
suspicious cars in the parking lot, particularly one that had
``suspicious writing on it.''
</P>
<P>
   One vehicle closely examined by police was registered to a
deceased elderly man, whose son lived in a modest, one-story brick
home in east Fort Worth. The man, described by neighbors as tall
and slender with long, thinning hair, was not home late Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors portrayed him as reclusive and said he was often seen
carrying a blue gym bag. They said he occasionally flashed a
temper, though no one knew if he had any particular religious
convictions. ``(He) has been strange as long as I can remember,''
said Karen Ivey, 38.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis called the shooting the ``worst mass incident that we've
been involved with.''
</P>
<P>
   A second man was being questioned by police Wednesday night, but
it was not immediately known if he was an accomplice in the
bloodbath on what was supposed to be a night for young Christians
to express their religious convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the wounded were being treated at John Peter Smith
Hospital, two at Harris Methodist Fort Worth and one at Cook
Children's Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Four were described as being in ``extremely critical''
condition, and Carter BloodCare officials said all their centers
would open at 9 a.m. Thursday for blood donations. Type O in
particular was needed, Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the confirmed dead are Sydney Browning, 36, director of
the children's choir at Wedgwood Baptist Church, and Justin
Stegner, a senior high school student.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the wounded were identified as Jeff Lester, a seminary
student and custodian at the church; Jaynanne Brown, Mary Beth
Talley, a senior at Southwest High School; Matt Parr, Southwest
junior; Nick Skinner, Cassie Griffin and Kevin Galey.
</P>
<P>
   Several students said Browning apparently was the first person
to encounter the shooter, casually greeting him at the door leading
to the sanctuary. The gunman responded by fatally shooting her.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses described the shooting as a massacre by a madman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was a joke,'' said Kristen Dickens, 14, who was
sitting in the second pew of the sanctuary when the gunfire
erupted. ``We were singing and he told us to shut up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our pastor was playing a joke on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Churchgoers dove for cover beneath pews as the shooter
splattered the sanctuary with bullets, stopping several times to
reload.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just kept telling us to stay still,'' said Chris Applegate,
a seventh grader who was attending choir practice in another part
of the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were singing a song and then in the middle of the song this
guy opened the door and fired one shot,'' Applegate said. ``He just
kept telling us to stay still.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all just jumped under the benches and he fired about 10
more shots. ... Somebody said, `Run, run!' and we all started
running.''

PEORIA RAISING COST OF GROWTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SHAUN MCKINNON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The cost of building a house in north Peoria will
climb soon by $12,353, an addition to the bottom line that has
nothing to do with the price of drywall or red tiles.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it's the city's attempt to figure out how much growth
costs and then find a way to pay at least part of the bill,
choosing last week to increase impact fees on new construction by
as much as 300 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome the benefits of growth, but we just believe it is
appropriate and responsible for those who benefit the most to pay
more for the cost of growth,'' Peoria Mayor John Keegan said.
</P>
<P>
   Peoria, with its ever-spreading sea of subdivisions and
far-flung undeveloped edges, offers a nearly perfect study in the
struggle to cope with both sides of growth _ the side that produces
new revenue and the side that soaks it up again.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly every city, school district and service provider in
the Phoenix area faces the same hard reality about growth: Left
alone, it won't pay for itself. New homes may bring new taxpaying
residents, but until the residents bring their own streets, schools
and water systems, the cities will have to scramble for more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cities have to look to provide everything that everybody who
lives in those new houses wants and needs,'' Glendale Mayor Elaine
Scruggs said. ``You don't do that with rooftops. Houses cost cities
money. It costs about twice as much to provide services as we ever
get from the tax base. You have to have revenue coming in other
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Urban planners have long argued that single-family homes don't
generate enough money to pay for the services needed to keep their
residents happy, especially not in the first year or two. Sprawling
subdivisions also make a wobbly tax base for bonds to build
bigger-ticket items like schools or water systems. &QL; 
A `BALANCING ACT' &QL; 
On the flip side, home builders say commercial developers, who
could infuse a bigger shot of revenue to help support the homes,
are reluctant to stake an outpost in the suburbs until the people
are there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a balancing act of what comes first and at what
rate,'' said Connie Wilhelm, president of the Home Builders
Association of Central Arizona. ``New growth can support new
growth. It is a timing issue of when the revenues are generated.
That's why you have to look at the whole area for a longer period
of time if you're going to evaluate homes.''
</P>
<P>
   She cites a 1987 study of two developing Phoenix neighborhoods
that looked at how much the city would spend on services for new
homes in the area and how much those homes would produce in
revenue, from taxes to money spent by homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   Over a nearly 50-year span, the study predicted the city would
break even, spending and collecting about $1 billion, a testament,
Wilhelm argues, to working with the big picture.
</P>
<P>
   But with thousands of new people moving to the Phoenix area each
month, most budget-conscious cities and school districts must work
first with the snapshot in front of them. Trying to find enough
money to pay for new growth means trying to figure out how much
growth costs, and most planners agree that number is a rapidly
moving target. What's true in Peoria isn't necessarily true in
Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an easy thing to do,'' said Tom Rex, research manager
for Arizona State University's Center for Business Research.
``There's no one right answer. The general consensus is, no, simply
building a house and collecting building permit fees and taxes
doesn't cover what it costs for services. But not every situation
is going to be the same.'' &QL; 
STUDIES OF COSTS &QL; 
Planning experts refer regularly to a handful of studies on how
much a new single-family home will cost local governments and
service providers, such as utilities. One study conducted by
Florida researchers more than a decade ago set the cost at about
$10,000 per house. A more recent and detailed study by Oregon
planning consultant Eben Fodor produced a price tag of about
$33,000.
</P>
<P>
   Broken down further, New Jersey researchers found that, in one
county, for every dollar a single-family home produced in taxes,
the local government spent $1.12 on public services. For every
dollar collected from commercial development, officials spent just
27 cents on services.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, planners say, the two sides should balance each other
out. The problem is, fast-growing neighborhoods are often swallowed
by subdivisions long before any commercial development arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Most cities are turning to impact fees to make up the difference
and keep up with needed infrastructure. Phoenix charges about
$9,000 per house in some neighborhoods, Peoria will collect more
than $12,000 in its still undeveloped northern edges, and even tiny
Queen Creek recently approved a $7,300-per-house impact fee.
</P>
<P>
   Peoria council members approved fee increases, repeating the
mantra that growth should pay for growth, a popular sentiment among
homeowners. &QL; 
`LINE IN THE SAND' &QL; 
But Wilhelm said communities used to accept the idea that a
neighborhood generated money needed to help support a new
neighborhood and that, down the road, that neighborhood would help
build up the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like somewhere, we drew a line in the sand and said new
homes have to pay for themselves,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That approach helps many cities build roads and water systems
they otherwise couldn't afford, but it drives up the cost of
housing and fails to address the needs for upkeep services in older
neighborhoods, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cities argue that as developers move farther and farther from
established neighborhoods, the cost of building roads and utility
infrastructure is just too high without substantial contributions
from the home builders.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix recently wrote into law a service boundary on the city's
northern end, outlying for developers where infrastructure will be
provided and where the builders will be on their own.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club wants even more restrictions, growth boundaries
that would limit where a developer could build anything. That
proposal could end up on the ballot next year, and home builders
concede it would be popular among growth-weary Phoenix area
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say they're looking for other solutions. Some school
districts have begun working more closely with builders and city
planners, so no one is surprised when a new subdivision opens or a
school fills up. &QL; 
BETTER PLANNING NEEDED
</P>
<P>
   Glendale Mayor Scruggs said cities also need better long-range
planning, including stronger efforts to attract jobs and commercial
development to balance out the new homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is to hold back those houses,'' she
said. ``There's always going to be home builders ready to build
houses. There's tons of them. But there are not so many
opportunities to land quality employers.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Traw, a Phoenix developer and real estate broker, said
builders are simply building too much too fast, leaving cities and
school districts to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need open spaces, large lots, parks, schools,'' he said.
``Transportation should be Number 1 _ put the roads in first. You
need to look at the whole picture, not just yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU's Rex said the Phoenix area can't depend on growth to
support itself forever. Sooner or later, the boom will level off
and so will the steady increase in revenue. Because Arizona cities
rely so heavily on sales tax, he said, a slowdown in growth is like
a punch to the gut of local coffers. Fewer homes built means not
only fewer new people but fewer construction supplies bought. &QL; 
WHEN THE CYCLE ENDS &QL; 
For now, Rex said, when the latest wave of homes needs services,
the last wave is generating enough money to get by, but that cycle
will end.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why when we've had recessions, they've had such a
terrible impact,'' he said. ``Everyone's overextended themselves.
As long as things keep going the way they're going, we're fine; but
sooner or later, there's going to be another recession.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, most planners and housing analysts say, everyone in
a community winds up paying at least part of the cost of growth,
whether it's through taxes, housing costs or a decline in services
as the municipal budget is stretched to its limits.
</P>
<P>
   New-home buyers may be hit first. As impact fees climb higher,
Wilhelm said, home builders have no choice but to pass along the
costs to home buyers. With profit margins of 3 to 5 percent, she
said, ``there's no way they can absorb fees that high.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just no way they can do anything but pass it along,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although impact fees can help a city avoid raising taxes or fees
on the general population, housing experts say that if those fees
drive up the price of a new home, the price of existing homes in
the same area will probably also rise, affecting people who may
just want to move across town.
</P>
<P>
   And when growth doesn't pay its own way, Eugene, Ore., community
planning consultant Eben Fodor wrote last year, taxpayers have to
make up the difference, a subsidy he suggests actually stimulates
even more growth by lowering the private cost of developing land.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, ``the high costs of urban growth are unavoidable.'' &QL;

GUNMAN FATALLY SHOOTS 7 AT CHURCH BEFORE KILLING HIMSELF
</HEADLINE>
  
 (CLARIFIES 2nd graf; ADDS background on other shootings; MINOR
edits thruout) 
 (Eds.: The following story is an added starter on The New York
Times front page)  (rk) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ As a hymn ended and prayers began at a special service
for teen-agers Wednesday evening at a Baptist church in Fort Worth,
a man with a semiautomatic handgun walked in and began firing,
killing six people in the church before turning the gun on himself.
An eighth person died later at a hospital, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. David Ellis of the Fort Worth Police Department said three
teen-agers and three adults were shot to death inside the church in
the city's southwest corner. The age of the seventh person killed
was unknown.Ellis also said that a pipe bomb exploded on a balcony
inside the church sanctuary after the 7 p.m. shooting and that the
department's bomb squad was inspecting several suspicious packages
found at the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's cartridges, shrapnel and empty cart boxes and blood
splattered all over the wall,'' Ellis was quoted by The Fort Worth
Star-Telegram as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Mendoza, Fort Worth's acting police chief, described the
gunman as a white male in his 20s or 30s but offered no other
information. He said the man had fired a semiautomatic handgun, and
officers had found at least three spent ammunition clips on the
floor of the sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was surprised the shooting had occurred inside a
church, the Fort Worth fire chief, Larry McMillen, responded, ``I'm
at the point where nothing surprises me.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 8 p.m., police officers told reporters and
bystanders to move inside an elementary school across the street
from the church because of the explosives.
</P>
<P>
   A supervisor with the Fort Worth Police Department, S. Coe, said
officers evacuated the church, Wedgwood Baptist, and a bomb squad
swept the sanctuary for other explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Coe said the gunman arrived at the church shortly before 7 p.m.
and began firing. An estimated 150 teen-agers were attending the
weekly service for the annual ``See You at the Pole'' gathering,
where students affirm their faith and concern for the problems of
society by holding prayer time around their school's flagpole.
</P>
<P>
   Christy Martin, 17, told a local television station, KDFW, that
the man ``was very calm and looked normal and was smoking a
cigarette.'' She added that the gunman had walked into the
sanctuary, ``pulled a gun and began firing. I just saw him point
the gun and shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   A young man interviewed on CNN said the gunman paused at least
once to reload his gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just saw him keep shooting and reloading,'' said the man,
who was not identified. ``He'd empty it and then throw some more
bullets in there, and he kept shooting. I seen him sit down, he
kept walking back and forth in the very back aisle, and he kept
shooting straight. I was at the side between the door and the
window and he looked like he looked at me, so I got down and he
started shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   The shooting is the latest in a spate of mass killings. In July,
a disgruntled day trader, Mark Barton, walked into the Atlanta
stock firm where he had lost more than $105,000 and opened fire on
customers and employees before killing himself. Barton had killed
his wife and two children earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In May, six students were injured in Conyers, Ga., when a
student opened fire at Heritage High School. In April, 15 people
were killed in Littleton, Colo., when two students went on a
shooting rampage at their high school. Those shootings were another
chapter in a tale of violence involving young people and guns.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997-98 school year students were killed or wounded in
Pearl, Miss.; West Paducah, Ky.; Edinboro, Pa.; Jonesboro, Ark.,
and Springfield, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   A witness, Kristen Dickens, 14, told the Fort Worth newspaper,
``We had just finished singing and we were praying when he came
in,'' she said. ``We thought it was a joke. We were singing and he
told us to shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on MSNBC, a man who was in the church said that
``all of a sudden we heard some bang noises.'' He went on to say
that a man then ``kind of fell across the doorway and said he had
been shot.''
</P>
<P>
   A teen-ager interviewed on CNN said: ``We were on stage playing.
We heard pops. We thought they were toys or something. A guy
started screaming in the back of the auditorium. And we seen him
load his gun so we just dove and ran out the building.''
</P>
<P>
   Another youth who was in the church described the gunman as
looking like the Unabomer, add that at first he ``thought it was a
joke.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``See You at the Pole'' service is celebrated at churches
across Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was the day youth in America gather around the flag pole
at their school and pray for their school,'' said Mark Collins, a
Baptist minister in Houston. He said the practice started about
five years ago, he believes with a youth group in a small Texas
town.

AIRLINES UNVEIL PLANS TO PUT `CUSTOMERS FIRST' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER CORBETT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - America West joined the nation's airlines Wednesday in
issuing customer service improvement plans that will be launched in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Under a June agreement that headed off congressional action to
force industry changes, each U.S. air carrier was required to
submit by Sept. 15 a plan for treating passengers better.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics remain skeptical that the new codes of conduct
submitted Wednesday to the U.S. Department of Transportation will
improve customer service.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., labeled the plans ``nothing but
legalistic gobbledygook, which (does) nothing to protect
passengers.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyden and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., had pushed for tough
legislation to force the industry to heed passenger complaints
about air travel horror stories.
</P>
<P>
   But an Air Passenger Bill of Rights proposed by the senators was
shelved in June when the Air Transport Association, an industry
lobbying group, proposed a 12-point voluntary customer service
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ATA President Carol Hallet said the airlines will do their part
to improve the air travel experience, and she called on the
government to do its part by improving the air-traffic control
system.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's ``Customers First'' plans for the airlines
require better communication with passengers on flight
cancellations and delays, as well as accurate information on the
lowest available fares. Customer service representatives must
respond to written complaints within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Carriers also must increase their liability for lost baggage
from $1,250 to a proposed $2,500, disclose cancellation and
frequent-flier policies and provide information on seat size and
legroom on specific aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   During long on-aircraft delays, the airlines must make
reasonable efforts to provide food, water, bathrooms and access to
medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   America West's plan adds some additional customer service
elements, but many of the policies already were in place, according
to spokeswoman Patty Nowack.
</P>
<P>
   Among the improvements is a commitment to notify passengers of
flight delays every 15 minutes at the airport gate and within five
minutes of the scheduled departure time when passengers are on the
aircraft at the gate or on the taxiway. An undisclosed number of
flight-tracking agents will be added to improve the flow of
information about flights, Nowack said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tempe-based airline, which is the dominant carrier in
Phoenix, also will provide brochures spelling out its customer
service policies, such as when a stranded passenger is entitled to
have the airline pay for a hotel room and meals.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, America West will compensate those travelers, unless
the flight is canceled because of inclement weather.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, travelers will be entitled to receive meal money
of $5 for breakfast, $7.50 for lunch and $10 for dinner, plus $25
to purchase items if they don't have their baggage.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, America West will provide ticket refunds within
seven days for credit card purchases and 20 days for cash
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   For competitive reasons, America West declined to say how much
it will cost to implement the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The other main carrier serving Phoenix, Southwest Airlines, said
it will be working to retrain many of its 28,000 employees to
implement its new customer service plan between now and Dec. 15,
according to spokeswoman Ginger Hardage.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas-based Southwest's plan has few changes from its current
practices, but the new policy will be available in writing for
customers, she said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the changes is holding airline reservations for 24 hours
before customers are required to pay for their tickets. This allows
travelers to shop for a better fare.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines says it will use 600 hand-held baggage scanning
devices in its busiest markets to help track luggage and improve
on-time performance. The Chicago-area-based airline also will
establish toll-free phone numbers for refunds and baggage inquiries
and a separate toll-free line for customer service complaints.
</P>
<P>
   In its hubs in Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Denver and
Washington (Dulles), United will deploy portable workstations,
called ``Mobile Chariots,'' that workers can use to check in
passengers, issue tickets and reaccommodate customers whose flights
are canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest Airlines will adopt an event recovery plan intended to
ensure that passengers will not be held on-board for more than an
hour if there is a delay when a plane lands at an airport.
</P>
<P>
   A New Year's weekend blizzard that stranded about 4,500
Northwest passengers on 32 planes for up to eight hours on the
runways at Detroit Metro Airport was one of the major issues that
prompted efforts to force air carriers to improve service.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest also will provide a customer-service booklet to assist
travelers. &QL;

FORT WORTH, Texas: started running.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Acting Police Chief Ralph Mendoza said he didn't know how long
the gunman terrorized the worshippers, but ``if you talk to any of
those witnesses and ask them, they're going to say it seemed like
an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, who was in Detroit campaigning for the
presidency, denounced the shooting as ``a terrible tragedy, made
worse by the fact that it took place in a house of hope and love.
My thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families and
the congregation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are prayerful for the individuals who have been shot and
their families, and mournful for the families of the deceased.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth Mayor Kenneth Barr, who was in Toluca, Mexico, for a
Sister Cities event, planned a hasty return to the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Fort Worth and we'll be united as a city in our
strength to see clear through the fog of this tragic criminal
act,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need to dedicate ourselves to understanding the
tragedy, and then to figuring out how to make the changes to keep
this from happening again. It is not unique to Fort Worth, but we
can start in Fort Worth, and we will.''
</P>
<P>
   The shootings occurred as worshippers gathered in several areas
of the church, some for choir practic, some to hear the Christian
rock band.
</P>
<P>
   Chip Gillette, a police officer who was off duty, looked outside
his house when he heard his dog barking and saw teenagers running
out of the church. He went to the church unarmed, heard the
gunshots and ran back to his house.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went back and got his equipment (gun, vest and police
radio) and basically threw the shirt on, so no one would mistake
him as the shooter,'' Mendoza said.
</P>
<P>
   He frantically relayed details of the shooting to a police
dispatcher.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Bray, 18, a senior at Crowley High School, was in the
sanctuary when he heard a gunshot shatter a window in the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt something go by my arm. I don't know if it was glass or
the bullet,'' Bray said.
</P>
<P>
   A few moments later, the gunman moved to the far right rear door
of the fan-shaped sanctuary and entered, firing a handgun into the
crowd, Bray said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hear him say anthing,'' Bray said. ``It sounded like
a handgun. He wasn't firing fast enough for it to be an automatic;
maybe semi-automatic, but not automatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He fired many, many times. My guess, at least 30,'' said Bray.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Rutledge and his wife, Sundi, both 22, were attending
their first service at the church and were in the fellowship hall
when they heard a commotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was hammering,'' said Kevin Rutledge, a
ministerial student at Dallas Baptist University. Then, he said, he
heard someone saying, ``I'm not joking. I'm shot.''
</P>
<P>
   As news of the shooting spread, people from other churches
arrived at Wedgwood Baptist, clutching Bibles as they gathered in
the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Police set up a command post at Bruce Shulkey Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   Eight-year-old Lauren Tabor said she was in a class called
``Girls in Action'' when she heard gunshots and screams.
</P>
<P>
   She and her classmates ran to another room, where they pushed a
table against the door ``so nobody could get in. We were all down
in a little corner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The teacher said, `Let's pray.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Another student Samantha Tabor, 9, quoted the teacher as saying,
``Dear Lord, help us. Don't let anybody get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   As news of the shooting spread, worried parents rushed to the
west Fort Worth church, many then speeding off to area hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they had no motive for the man's violent rampage.
</P>
<P>
   Dax Hughes, the church's college minister, said at least 150
young people were inside the sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hits the door real hard to make his presence known and he
just immediately started firing,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   When the gunfire was over, Hughes said, the man ``sat in the
back pew and put a gun (to his head) and shot himself and fell
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses quoted the man as saying he didn't agree with what the
young people were doing at the church.
</P>
<P>
   One witness, identified only as Rachel, said the teens at the
church conducted many skits, one of which was the meaning of life
and what it means to face death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was blanks,'' she said of the gunfire. ``A lot of
them were saying that this was some kind of drama presentation.
They though it was a skit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Forty Days band was playing a song called ``Alle,'' short
for alleluia, when ``we heard a couple of pops and we thought it
was the speakers,'' said Drue Phillips, 19, the group's bass player
and back-up singer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was a joke. We knew a skit was going on later.''
</P>
<P>
   Before entering the church, the gunman fired several shots at
the windows, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Damon Bernard, 17, said he was sitting in the front of the
sanctuary when the gunman started shooting. Bernard said Stegner,
who was videotaping the rally, turned around and started
videotaping the gunman. ``Right after he turned around,'' Bernard
said, ``the gunman shot him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernard said people started rushing out of the sanctuary, but he
stayed behind to try and help. He went over to where Stegner was
lying and saw a pool of blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was whimpering.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernard said it was too late for Stegner, he was gasping for his
last breath.
</P>
<P>
   Johnathan Warner, a junior at North Crowley High School, said
the Wedgwood Baptist youth group had been papering the neighborhood
with fliers announcing the day's prayer rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was bigger than any other place was doing it,'' said
Warner, a Wedgwood neighborhood resident.

MISSOURI HOUSE VOTES TO OVERRIDE CARNAHAN'S VETO OF ABORTION BILL 
</HEADLINE>
 1st ld writethru (subs to change category)-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL SENTELL  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ The Missouri House voted Wednesday to
override Gov. Mel Carnahan's veto of an anti-abortion bill, setting
up a decisive, high-stakes battle today in the Senate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 127-34 to override Carnahan's veto while rival
partisans watched from packed galleries. The tally was 18 votes
more than the 109 required for the two-thirds majority required by
the state constitution. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the bill still need two-thirds approval in the Senate
_ 23 votes _ for the bill to take effect despite the governor's
veto. It passed 27-6 in May. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only six vetoes have been overridden in state history. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moments after the House vote, Sen. Ted House, a St. Charles
Democrat and Senate sponsor, predicted the Senate override attempt
would benefit from the lopsided House vote. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very encouraging that virtually no one bought the
arguments by the abortion industry,'' House said. ``I expect the
same result in the Senate.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Senate debate will last hours or days is unclear,
because earlier Senate debate on the bill lasted 38 hours. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both sides on the issue have a huge investment in the outcome of
the Senate vote. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Supporters have invested several years on the issue and risk
losing momentum if they cannot override the veto. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Carnahan's gubernatorial prestige is on the
line. A defeat by a legislature controlled by his own party could
also be an issue in his U.S. Senate bid next year against
Republican incumbent John Ashcroft, an abortion opponent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the House was debating the abortion bill and other
legislation, the Senate voted 24-8 to override the governor's veto
of a crime bill. The House declined to consider the issue, however,
and completed its work without voting to override any other
vetoes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the abortion measure say the bill would
criminalize a late-term abortion procedure that they describe as
``partial birth'' abortion by classifying it as infanticide. The
procedure would be a felony unless it was performed to save the
mother's life. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan, who contends that the bill is unconstitutional and
would result in abortion clinics closing in Missouri, told
reporters he was disappointed by the House vote but planned to work
hard to prevail in the Senate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan has said the bill would ban most abortions and could
provide a legal defense to anti-abortion violence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The governor has to persuade at least five senators who voted
for the bill in May to switch sides, a politically perilous move by
senators on such a closely watched issue. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have members to work with who think this is a bad
bill,'' he said. ``If I can convince them to vote the way they
think, I will be sustained.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the House debate, Rep. Bill Luetkenhaus, a Josephville
Democrat and House sponsor, rebutted a variety of arguments put
forth by opponents of the bill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Luetkenhaus noted that former Missouri Supreme Court Justices
John Bardgett and Chip Robertson wrote letters contradicting
assertions that the bill could provide a legal defense for
anti-abortion violence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said officials of Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital in St.
Louis disputed arguments that the bill would complicate efforts to
save premature infants, another contention made by Carnahan and
others. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters overwhelmingly in this state want to ban partial
birth abortions,'' Luetkenhaus said. ``Let's listen to them.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Vicky Hartzler, a Harrisonville Republican, took issue with
comments by opponents of the bill who said it represented
government intrusion into the lives of women. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The government's role is to protect its most vulnerable,''
Hartzler told the House. ``That is what we are doing today.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the bill said that they wanted to ban ``partial
birth'' abortions but that the Luetkenhaus bill was riddled with
flaws. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carol Jean Mays, an Independence Democrat, said that she
had what she called a compromise bill to ban such abortions and
that Carnahan would sign it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleading with all of you for a middle-of-the-road
philosophy,'' Mays said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other opponents argued that the vetoed bill was designed to
overturn the 1973 decision that legalized abortions and that the
measure would trigger a costly court fight that ultimately would
result in the bill being struck down. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Luetkenhaus said he welcomed getting the issue to the courts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We should proceed, do the override and then let the judges
decide,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The governor told reporters that if the Senate sustained his
veto, he would call a special session to pass a new ban that would
allow the procedure to preserve the mother's health, not just her
life. Opponents of such a provision said it was too broad and would
be abused. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan said that, despite the lopsided House tally, at one
point in recent days he was within half a dozen votes of getting
his veto sustained in the House. But when it became obvious that
the veto could not be sustained, lawmakers who considered switching
sides voted for the override instead, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The override was backed by all 76 Republicans in the House, as
well as 50 of Carnahan's fellow Democrats and one independent.
Thirty-four Democrats voted against the override. One Democrat
voted ``present,'' and one was absent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The House vote followed nearly three hours of debate amid heavy
Capitol security, in part because the issue attracted huge public
attention. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the bill, many wearing red and wearing ``Ban the
Brutality'' stickers, rallied on the south side of the Capitol to
blast Carnahan, denounce the abortion industry and vow to make the
override attempt a success. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Together we can move the mountains of injustice and evil,''
Sen. House told the crowd. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such comments won praise from supporters such as Mary Travis,
who was part of a church group from Harrisonville who attended the
rally. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this is murdering infants,'' Travis said of
``partial birth'' abortions. ``It needs to stop.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gus Kolilis, chief of the Capitol police, estimated that the
rally in support of the override attracted about 2,000 people.
Organizers said they had nearly 5,000 people at the Capitol. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, about 100 abortion-rights supporters gathered
briefly on the north side of the Capitol to hear speeches about the
what they called dangers in the bill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Boisseau, 79, said he came from the St. Louis suburb of
University City to let lawmakers know they were misinterpreting the
views of most Missourians. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very extreme bill,'' Boisseau said. ``It would ban
all abortions. The director of Planned Parenthood told us this
morning that if this goes through, they won't schedule abortions
until the law is set aside, because they want to avoid
prosecution.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although the debate at the Capitol was trouble-free, Jefferson
City public schools were dismissed after a bomb threat was made,
citing Carnahan's opposition to the abortion bill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the constitution, the veto session is limited to 10 days.  &QL;

<P>
   MOSCOW _ A truck exploded next to a nine-story apartment
building in the Rostov region in southern Russia early Thursday,
leaving at least four people dead and 70 hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the blast, at 5:50 a.m. in the city of Volgodonsk,
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin ordered Russian special forces to
join firefighters and other rescuers at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fifth explosion in Russia since Aug. 31, when a blast
hit a Moscow shopping center, killing one and injuring 40. That was
followed by an explosion at a building in Dagestan that housed
Russian officers and their families, which killed 64.
</P>
<P>
   Two more explosions in Moscow killed more than 210.
</P>
<P>
   Russian police, disclosing their findings of the explosions of
the two recent Moscow blasts, said Wednesday that Chechen militants
had shipped tons of explosives into Moscow disguised as bags of
sugar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found out who carried out the explosions,'' Moscow's
deputy police chief, Aleksandr Veldyayev, said Thursday. ``The
terrorist attacks were carried out by Chechen fighters.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Muscovites believe that the bombings, which have sent waves
of anxiety through the city, were the work of Islamic militants who
invaded Dagestan from bases in Chechnya, and people from the
Caucasus already have felt the backlash
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's bombing followed Russian press reports that said
``informants'' had indicated the rebels planned to attack not only
Moscow, but also Rostov and St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the militants _ Shamil Basayev, the Chechen
warlord, and a Jordanian-born fighter known as Khattab _ have
insisted that they are not involved.
</P>
<P>
   The charges and denials have prompted an important question: If
the aim of the bombings is to pressure Russia to abandon Dagestan,
why would the Islamic rebels deny any involvement?
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the mystery, a previously unknown group, the Dagestan
Liberation Army, called the semiofficial Itar-Tass news agency
Wednesday to claim it had organized the Moscow attacks. But some
experts said they doubted the group even existed.
</P>
<P>
   Assigning responsibility is important. Public sentiment here for
tough action against Chechnya _ and the Chechens who live in Moscow
_ is running high.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechen government says that Russian conspirators carried
out the attacks, possibly to provide a pretext for the Yeltsin
government to declare a state of emergency and suspend the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one conclusion,'' said Chechnya's deputy prime
minister, Kazbek Makhashev. ``Russia needs a hot spot to solve its
own domestic political problems and its battle for power.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chechen authorities do not support the militants, who have
become a power to themselves near the Chechnya-Dagestan border.
</P>
<P>
   But they also do not want Russia to continue its bombing raids
against rebel positions inside Chechnya or step up its offensive
by, perhaps, launching a ground attack.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said that 27 suspects had been detained as
part of a campaign to find those responsible, but in their
briefings Thursday, Russian police and intelligence officials did
not name any.
</P>
<P>
   They insisted, however, that they had evidence that confirmed
the involvement of Chechen militants, aided by people of Slavic
appearance, an important asset since dark-skinned Chechens often
are viewed suspiciously in Moscow.

MCCAIN ALTERS CAMPAIGN RE FORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain's elusive goal of limiting the
influence of big money in political campaigns finally may be within
reach, after a McCain decision to accommodate some Republican
objections to his bill.
<TEXT>
<P>
   After the House passed a version of his bill Tuesday, McCain has
decided to drop its most controversial provision, a move he
believes will dramatically increase its chances of passage in the
Senate next month, The Arizona Republic has learned.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is central to McCain's presidential campaign, in which
he presents himself as a reform candidate eager to ``take our
government back from the special interests and big-dollar
contributors.'' A Senate victory would lend his campaign momentum,
allowing him to claim ownership of one of the most significant
government reforms since the post-Watergate era.
</P>
<P>
   When the bill is unveiled Sept. 16, it will be missing a section
subjecting advocacy groups to federal spending limits and
disclosure requirements when they broadcast campaign advertisements
at election time.
</P>
<P>
   The provision long had been a staple of McCain's legislation,
which was supported by a majority of the Senate last year but was
never voted on because McCain and co-sponsor Russell Feingold,
D-Wis., could not manage the 60 votes necessary to overcome a
Republican-led filibuster. They fell eight votes short.
</P>
<P>
   The ad restrictions also were part of a similar reform bill in
the House that had McCain's blessing and was approved, 252-177,
late Tuesday night. All five House Republicans from Arizona voted
against the measure, at least partly because of the provision that
McCain is now planning to strip from the Senate version.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only item I had a problem with,'' Arizona Rep. Matt
Salmon said. ``If they can address that, I'm there.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's hope and belief is that there are senators who share
Salmon's view.
</P>
<P>
   If the House and Senate passed competing versions, it would be
left to a conference committee of both chambers to iron out the
differences.
</P>
<P>
   Like the House bill, McCain's version will still feature a ban
on ``soft money,'' the limitless, unregulated gifts collected by
national political parties from corporations, wealthy individuals
and unions. Soft money is supposed to build support for parties
rather than assist specific candidates, but both parties stretched
the rules during the 1996 presidential campaign and are poised to
do so again.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is also expected to contain language to enforce a
Supreme Court decision requiring approval from members before
unions use their dues for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   McCain still supports his now-deleted ad provision because he
believes interest groups that act like campaigns should be
regulated like campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But after meeting privately with many senators, McCain became
convinced that if he were to resurrect the soft money ban, he
needed to change the voting ``dynamic'' that doomed the measure in
1997 and 1998, his office said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the prior opposition to his bill was generated by
abortion foes, the National Rifle Association and other interest
groups that argued that the ad provision muzzled their political
speech.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the National Right to Life Committee said last year
that McCain's rules ``would cripple the pro-life movement'' by
restricting their advocacy efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The committee said it was not subject to federal election laws
in 1996 when it waged a broadcast campaign to get Congress to back
a ``partial birth'' abortion ban. Under McCain's proposal, the
committee's radio ads, which mentioned members of Congress by name,
would have been subject to full financial disclosure requirements
if they had been broadcast at election time.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has not ruled out introducing the provision as an
amendment to the overall bill. That way, his aides reasoned, the
amendment could be defeated without taking down the entire bill
with it.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time McCain has stripped down the bill to
gain support. Two years ago, he trimmed a section that would have
provided economic incentives to candidates who met specified
spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   In a key campaign speech, McCain told a New Hampshire audience
in July that Congress has been ``corrupted'' by soft money and that
he intends to prove wrong politicians who insist that voters don't
care about reforming the campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is fond of quoting _ and disagreeing with _ a statement
by Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., a few years ago that voters weren't
much interested in overhauling the big-money system, and that ``not
a single race has been decided on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of the Senate support for McCain's bill comes from
Democrats, whose national committee typically receives less soft
money than the GOP. McCain has managed over the years to attract
only a small minority of his own party.
</P>
<P>
   This year, supporters of the bill believe there is reason for
optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel this time there is some momentum,'' said Jerome
Kohlberg, a New York businessman who founded the Washington-based
Campaign Reform Project. ``The monies are so enormous now, they've
doubled since four years ago, and people are getting sick and tired
of being dunned for enormous sums.'' &QL;

INSURER TO COVER HOMES AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Five years after the 1994 Northridge Earthquake
nearly ruined the company, 20th Century Insurance Co. announced
that it has resumed sales of home insurance policies in California.
</P>
<P>
   There is one big difference this time: The company will not be
selling earthquake policies. Customers who want that coverage will
be referred to GeoVera Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, insurance companies that sold homeowners policies
also were required to offer earthquake coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you don't have to sell the insurance. You have to provide
an outlet, which means we have a resource (for) the customer,''
said 20th Century spokesman Ric Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The company based in the Woodland Hills community of Los
Angeles' San Fernando Valley, pushed to the brink of bankruptcy by
more than $1 billion in losses from the earthquake, quit the
homeowners insurance market in mid-1994.
</P>
<P>
   Officials announced in April that the company would be allowed
back into the homeowners market after agreeing to set up a fund for
customers whose earthquake-damaged homes still had not been fixed.
</P>
<P>
   The company has spent the interim setting up the new program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first issue had to do with getting all the new forms and
rates approved by the regulators. We had to submit the entire
program again,'' said Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Rates will be about 7.5 percent lower on average than before the
company quit the homeowners insurance business, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A 10 percent discount will be offered on homeowners insurance to
automobile insurance customers.
</P>
<P>
   While the traditional homeowners coverage will be less expensive
than before, quake coverage will not be a bargain, Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will never truly be the same again,'' he said of quake
coverage. ``It is possible to obtain (policies) similar to what we
had before, but you're going to pay a significant amount for that
product now.''
</P>
<P>
   Reintroducing the homeowners line is part of 20th Century's
expansion plan for the state.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Heller, a consumer advocate at the Foundation for Taxpayer
and Consumer Rights, said it is good to have another player back in
the homeowner market but that more quake providers are needed. The
organization's focus initially was on insurance issues.
</P>
<P>
   The only major policy writers today are GeoVera, Pacific Select
Insurance Co. and the California Earthquake Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that expanded coverage is available. Since
Northridge, more and more people have been dropping even the
limited (earthquake) coverage available, which could turn the next
disaster into an even greater disaster,'' Heller said.
</P>
<P>
   Hills said 20th Century markets personal automobile insurance in
Arizona, California, Nevada, Oregon and Washington.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Family members and friends came to area
hospitals after the church shootings in Fort Worth, many of them
hugging and holding hands as they looked for loved ones _ and
hoped.
</P>
<P>
   One victim was a boy, celebrating his 16th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   A friend, Rebecca Collins, said the boy was ecstatic earlier in
the day because he finally was old enough to drive. ``He came to
lunch happy. He'd gotten his license. He was a very happy man,''
Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was told that her friend, a 10th-grader at Brewer
High School, had been shot in the shoulder and in the spine.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said she and other friends had also planned to be at the
church. ``We were going to go, but we happened to miss the bus, so
we didn't,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said that she was relieved that she was not there, but that
she hurt for the victims. ``You're happy you're not there, but then
how can you be happy if they were?'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Of her friend, she added: ``He's great, very Christian, very
into Jesus. This isn't supposed to happen to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The first ambulance arrived at John Peter Smith Hospital at 7:30
p.m., carrying two females and a young man.
</P>
<P>
   One of the females, dressed in blue overalls, appeared to be
conscious but in shock. The other, shot in the upper chest, was
unconscious. The young man was sitting up on the stretcher as he
was wheeled into the emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 minutes later, another ambulance carrying two wounded
males arrived. One of the victims was moving his arms and adjusting
his oxygen mask. The other lay motionless on a stretcher.
</P>
<P>
   In the lobby, a woman whose clothes were spattered with blood
said her 17-year-old daughter, Heather MacDonald, was saved by a
young friend. As the gunman approached, ``she laid on top of my
daughter to protect her, and she got shot,'' the woman said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman said she was waiting for any word on the condition of
her daughter's friend.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Brown said his wife, Jaynanne, was shot, but the bullet
grazed her head. She was taken to Harris Methodist Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   She was supposed to pick him up from work Wednesday night, Steve
Brown said, but instead decided to take their children to a prayer
meeting and concert at the church.
</P>
<P>
   He said Jaynanne Brown was sitting in the south foyer of the
church waiting for choir practice to start, talking with friends,
when they looked up and saw a man they didn't recognize walking
toward the side foyer.
</P>
<P>
   He had a cigarette in his mouth, and as he approached the people
in the foyer, his wife and friends said, ``Hope he takes it out
before he comes in.'' And then, Jaynanne Brown told her husband,
``All of a sudden he pulls out a pistol.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the bullets grazed his wife's head, and Brown said, ``God
was protecting my wife, because it went right across her head. We
could very easily have been burying her tomorrow (Thursday).''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Brown said he learned about the shooting when his
sister-in-law saw reports of it on television. He borrowed her car
and drove to the church and then to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just thankful she's ready to go home,'' said Brown, who is
head baseball coach at North Crowley High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank the Lord somebody protected her,'' Brown said. ``But
it's just a shame you can't go to church without something like
this happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm Stuart, pastor at Matthew Road Baptist Church in Grand
Prairie, spoke to some of the family members waiting at Harris
Methodist.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't trust anybody anywhere,'' Stuart said.

the former artisan's cottage Ms. Blow shares with her husband,
Detmar Blow, an art dealer, prepares visitors for the blazing
modernity of the interior nor the eccentricity of its inhabitants.
By night, however, passers-by are often startled by the merrily
demented light show emanating from the curtainless ground-floor

pleasure. By Christopher Mason.

Vienna and every other detail of the $1.8 million dollar

was the largest single issue for fans who come to more than three
games a year,'' said Kathryn St. John, a spokeswoman for the Red
Sox. ``When the park was full, people were literally overflowing
their seats.'' In the new stadium, fans will enjoy an 18- or

<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The parallels are striking.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen years ago, two remarkable welterweights _ Sugar Ray
Leonard and Tommy Hearns _ met here in one of the most important
lower-weight fights of all time. One was a good-looking,
charismatic Olympic gold-medal winner, the other a tall, fearsome
knockout artist who seemed to be unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, it seems history will repeat itself _ only with the
names Oscar De La Hoya and Felix Trinidad on the marquee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost eerie in terms of their styles,'' boxing
television analyst Larry Merchant said.
</P>
<P>
   However, does Saturday's energy-packed matchup truly rival the
unforgettable 1981 bout or other bouts in an era graced with the
once-in-a-lifetime foursome of Leonard, Hearns, Roberto Duran and
Marvin Hagler?
</P>
<P>
   Yes and no.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, in terms of its place in boxing history and the record
amount of money it will generate. De La Hoya and Trinidad are two
of the three or four best fighters in the world and will be paid
handsomely because of it.
</P>
<P>
   No, in terms of impact on the general public. Even the casual
sports fan was captivated by Leonard and Co. _ who built their
names on free television _ while only De La Hoya among today's lot
has managed to pierce the public consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, promoters have a great deal of work ahead if
they hope to create anything resembling the earlier era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can it happen again? I don't think so,'' Leonard said. ``I
don' think it has the potential. Boxing at one time had true
characters and personalities, marquee names.''
</P>
<P>
   No one can argue that Saturday's fight isn't on par with
Leonard-Hearns in terms of boxing.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier group came along at the perfect time, when the
heavyweight division was down. Muhammad Ali's career had just ended
and boxing fans at the time were hungry for new heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, America's darling after his Olympic success, had
already faced Duran twice _ including the famous ``no mas'' fight
in which Leonard avenged an earlier loss _ and the unbeaten Hearns
had built a Tyson-like reputation by stopping 30 of his 32
opponents. It was a mesmerizing backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   Fans in those days couldn't have asked for more. Certainly, the
same can be said for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, both fighters have perfect records _ De La Hoya
31-0 with 25 knockouts, Trinidad 35-0, (30 KOs) _ and it's
difficult to imagine either losing a fight. With the heavyweight
division again in a slide, this is the best the sport has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, no two other fighters alive (with the
possible exception of Mike Tyson) could create such intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN magazine put it well in its calendar listing for Sept. 18:
``Last chance to see what boxing can be _ before Evander
(Holyfield) and Lennox (Lewis) remind you what it actually is.''
</P>
<P>
   This bout is unparalleled in terms of economics.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard and Hearns made huge paydays, particularly the time.
Leonard took home an estimated $11 million, Hearns $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   However, that's chump change compared to the amount of money
generated in the pay-per-view era. De La Hoya could make more than
$20 million when a percentage of pay-per-view buys are factored in,
Trinidad well over $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Promoters Bob Arum and Don King and others involved in the
promotion won't be hurting, either. Organizers are expecting a
pay-per-view buy rate of at least a million, which would be
considerably more than the number of people who saw Leonard-Hearns
because that fight was televised primarily at closed-circuit
venues. It would also break the nonheavyweight record of 760,000
established in the De La Hoya-Pernell Whitaker fight of 1997 but
fall short of the estimated 2 million for Tyson-Holyfield II.
</P>
<P>
   At $50 a buy, that's an automatic $50 million. And that's not
counting closed-circuit or overseas profits, which promise to fill
the deep pockets of those involved with even more cash.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the only area in which Saturday's bout seems to fall
short in comparison to Leonard's era is on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, as with De La Hoya today, was the key cog. MILLIONS
watched him win his gold medal on ABC and he continued to build his
reputation on free TV. And he appealed to all ethnic groups _
everyone followed his career.
</P>
<P>
   The others _ Hearns, Duran and Hagler _ never claimed that kind
of allegiance but were stars in their own right. Hearns had that
alluring big-punch appeal, Hagler was a complete, seemingly
immobile force and Duran was a legend.
</P>
<P>
   And they all came along at the same time. They fought eight
times among them _ EIGHT historic matchups in a span of nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the definition of of greatness is who you rub up
against in the ring. Each of those men made the others great,''
historian Bert Sugar said.
</P>
<P>
   And today?
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya is the only star among a talented but relatively
anonymous group of fighters in and around the welterweight
division. And even !italhe is no Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing wasn't a featured Olympic event by the time De La Hoya
won America's only gold medal in 1992, although the Barcelona Games
certainly was a significant springboard.
</P>
<P>
   And while De La Hoya is signing more endorsement deals every
day, his reach seems to be limited.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say he's tremendously popular in the Latino market but
not outside it. This is at least in part because his biggest fights
have been seen only by hard-core boxing fans willing to pay
exorbitant pay-per-view fees while his less-important fights have
been televised on cable's HBO.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond De La Hoya, there is a wasteland. While boxing fans and
those in the business are well aware of Trinidad and his talents,
few others knew who the Spanish-speaking Puerto Rican was before
this fight.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the others in the deep, talented group of today:
Ike Quartey, David Reid, Fernando Vargas and Shane Mosley. Again,
boxing people are aware of the ability of these fine young
fighters, but Vargas might be best known among casual fans because
of his recent arrest for assault.
</P>
<P>
   Without De La Hoya in the mix, no one would care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Free TV was such a huge vehicle,'' Leonard said. ``It was what
really catapulted me to stardom. Fathers, mothers, kids,
grandmothers, they all knew me from free TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the fight fans who follow boxing are concentrated on
pay-per-view. It's a different situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there hope?
</P>
<P>
   This match will give boxing what it needs: a megafight worth
watching. The question is whether the powers that be will build on
the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   If he wins, will De La Hoya give Trinidad a rematch or face Reid
or Vargas or Mosley? If Trinidad wins, will De La Hoya get HIS
rematch? And will Quartey, Reid and Vargas _ as well as other top
welterweights _ take the risk of fighting one another to build
interest in themselves and the sport?
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to create a series of meaningful bouts a la the
'80s. That's what this group and boxing needs to recapture the
interest of the mainstream sports fan who seems to have drifted
away. However, that doesn't mean we'll ever see the likes of
Leonard-Hearns-Duran-Hagler again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing ever really duplicates itself,'' Merchant said.
``Leonard was the one who made the series happen. And you had
Duran, who is considered one of the greatest fighters ever. Then
you had Hearns, a knockout sensation. And then they all grew into
Hagler's division (middleweight).
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it all depends on De La Hoya, win or lose _ who he'll go
after, whether there will be rematch. He will have fought three
excellent fights in a row now (Quartey, Oba Carr and Trinidad). If
that's how he wants to conduct his career and does well in this
fight, then we could start to have something similar to the
(Leonard) era. It's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But not likely.

11 LAPD OFFICERS SUSPENDED IN POLICE PROBE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Eleven Los Angeles police officers have been
relieved of duty in a corruption investigation based partly on
allegations by an officer who pleaded guilty to stealing cocaine
from an evidence room at the LAPD's headquarters, Police Chief
Bernard C. Parks announced.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said the officers, including one from the San Fernando
Valley, were relieved from duty Wednesday as part of a continuing
investigation based on allegations that might involve drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at 12 to 13 officers who may be involved in
criminal or administrative charges,'' Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   He said one of the 13 officers already has been forced into
retirement, and another, Rafael Antonio Perez, pleaded guilty
earlier this month to possession with intent to sell cocaine in an
agreement with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, 32, agreed to cooperate with the Los Angeles Police
Department's corruption probe in exchange for a lighter sentence,
Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a significant amount of corruption that we're
concerned with, but I would not like to label the LAPD as
corruption-prone,'' the chief said. ``The fear is that all 12 of
them could be involved in criminal activities. . . . It's not a
good day.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks added that he hoped some of the suspended officers ``may
not even be involved.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Mayor Richard Riordan, members of the Los Angeles City
Council and the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office have
been notified of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Chief Michael Bostic, commanding officer of the Valley
Bureau, said one of the officers under investigation is stationed
in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   But all of the officers who were suspended worked at one time or
another at the Los Angeles Police Department's Rampart Division, an
area with a heavy immigrant population west of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the alleged criminal activities occurred both
within the LAPD and the community.
</P>
<P>
   All of the officers will be assigned to their homes with pay,
pending the outcome of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will not be allowed to participate in law enforcement
activities,'' Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   Parks also said the probe turned up information that could lead
to the reversal of a conviction of a man who was accused of
assaulting Perez and his partner, Officer Nino DuB?7iptD

A-ROD STRUGGLING WITH BAT BUT NOT CONFIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ The bat never left Alex Rodriguez's hands
until he had swung it one more time.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners shortstop popped out to end an 8-4 loss to the
Tampa Bay Devil Rays Wednesday night, and he clutched his bat on
the jog to first and the trot back to the bench. A few steps before
the dugout, Rodriguez gave the lumber one soft, almost nostalgic
swing before dropping it to the turf and disappearing. It's been a
while since he's swung the way he wants to.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was hardly responsible for the loss, an unsightly
performance that featured three Mariner errors, two hit batsmen, a
wild pitch and a tie-breaking homer by Tampa Bay's Herbert Perry
off Frankie Rodriguez (2-4) in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   But he went hitless in five at-bats, four of the outs ending
innings, the last three with runners in scoring position. This
month, Rodriguez is batting .089, with just five hits in 56
at-bats. Since homering on Friday in Baltimore, he has been held to
one infield single in 24 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inexcusable, and quite honestly, it's embarrassing,''
Rodriguez said. `` ... It's been probably the biggest struggle I've
had in my young career. But what I'm enjoying about it is that it's
something I believe I can come out of. I have so much confidence in
my ability and my work ethic that everything's going to be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was reminded that the player who made the final out
Tuesday, Tampa Bay's Aaron Ledesma, had hurled his bat in disgust.
Rodriguez shrugged and considered the comparison. He is not prone
to outbursts _ though he did slam his bat to the dirt after popping
out in the fifth and worked out his frustration in private.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throwing the bat is not going to make it any better, it's not
going to relieve any stress or anything,'' Rodriguez said. ``Just
go out and work on my game, and that's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five minutes after the game, as most of his teammates were
leaving for the bus, Rodriguez was finishing a session in the
batting cage. Some players do that often; former Mariner David
Segui had trouble sleeping if he hadn't fixed his swing before
leaving the park. But Rodriguez takes postgame hitting only two or
three times a year, when he needs special attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, he's pressing,'' said hitting coach Jesse Barfield,
noting Rodriguez went through a similar stretch last September
before his 40th home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``His swing is long _ Ray Charles can see that _ and he's flying
open the majority of the time. But he's a workaholic. As a matter
of fact, Wednesday he came out for extra work, and I had to tell
him to shut it down. I told him afterwards, `That's a compliment
for you, for a coach to have to tell a player to cut back.'''
</P>
<P>
   Barfield and manager Lou Piniella believe Rodriguez is tired. He
has missed only one game since coming off the disabled list in
mid-May, and Piniella plans to rest him Thursday or Friday.
Mechanically, Barfield said, a player with tired legs relies on his
upper body, rushing instead of staying back in his stance.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth-inning pop-up came on a high changeup from Wilson
Alvarez. Had Rodriguez been mechanically sound, the pitch would
have turned into his 38th home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's on, you don't make a mistake like that,'' Barfield
said. ``If you gear toward right-center, anything middle-in like
that, especially a mistake, it's a dinger for him. It's a well-hit
ball, a line drive, and line drives for Alex are home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the season, starting Thursday in batting
practice, Barfield said he wants Rodriguez to concentrate on
hitting to the opposite field. He hasn't stopped hitting to right,
Barfield said, but by keeping that approach, Rodriguez's mechanics
are more likely to correct themselves. It takes a nearly perfect
swing to drive a ball out to right-center, Barfield told Rodriguez,
and the shortstop understood. He needs to get back in that habit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where I make my living,'' Rodriguez said. ``Any time I
get out of any type of funk, that's where I start hitting the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rodriguez will emerge from it, Barfield said, shaking his
head and smiling. There's no doubting that.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he comes out of it,'' Barfield said, ``honestly, I feel
sorry for the pitchers he's going to face.''

SCHOOL BOARD TO MEET ON ZACARIAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREG GITTRICH   AND BETH BARRETT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Stunned by an internal review of the Belmont
Learning Center, the Los Angeles Unified school board will
immediately evaluate Superintendent Ruben Zacarias' performance,
including accusations he failed to properly oversee the $200
million scandal, the Daily News has learned.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Zacarias questioned the fairness of judging his
role in Belmont as outlined Tuesday by Don Mullinax, director of
the LAUSD Internal Audit and Special Investigations Unit. Several
Los Angeles Unified School District sources said the evaluation is
part of power struggle between Zacarias and the new reform board,
which feels the need to respond quickly to the scathing report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real infighting has begun, and it centers around who will
mete out the discipline to the employees mentioned by name in
Mullinax's report,'' said an administrator, who asked not to be
named.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a wounded superintendent who has been tarnished by
the report and a board with three new members above the fray.
Zacarias says essentially they are his employees and that he should
do any punishing. The board says he's tainted and shouldn't be
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullinax's findings _ that 16 current and former LAUSD officials
failed the district by allowing the nation's costliest high school
to be built downtown atop an oil field permeated with explosive
methane gas _ were disputed by three of those who face discipline,
including possible dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest defense came from Chief Counsel Richard K. Mason,
who blamed legal consultant David W. Cartwright and his firm,
O'Melveny and Myers, for the public works fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   O'Melveny, which investigators said should be sued by the
district for its role in Belmont, could not be reached immediately
for comment, but had previously denied misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   As the power struggle unfolded, several high-ranking sources in
the district, including two board members, told the Daily News that
the Board of Education will huddle this morning with outside legal
counsel to establish new parameters for Zacarias' job evaluation. A
review would begin immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Sales, a spokesman for the superintendent, said he was
unaware of the board's plans to discuss Zacarias' performance at
today's closed session.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly within their purview to do it,'' Sales said.
``But given the fact that there is not an agreed-upon set of goals
and objectives for the superintendent, one wonders what form the
evaluation would take.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly could not be based upon any objective measures
except for the (investigative) report. And that certainly is only
one small part of the superintendent's job.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mullinax report charged that Zacarias ``failed to supervise
the Belmont project in a diligent, professional and effective
manner.'' Mullinax advised the school board to include his findings
in the superintendent's next evaluation, which had been expected to
take place in January.
</P>
<P>
   Mullinax included Zacarias on a list of former and current
employees who failed to ``exercise proper management'' in the
Belmont project. The investigator told the board to discipline, if
not fire, the employees, including Chief Administrative Officer
David Koch and Mason.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Scott Wildman, D-Glendale, a vocal critic of
Belmont, said Zacarias should be given a chance to take ``immediate
and decisive action.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ruben Zacarias has the information in his hands to hold senior
staff responsible for this fiasco. They all need to be fired,''
Wildman said. ``The stage is set for him to take action or suffer
the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   District policy calls for Zacarias, who became superintendent in
July 1997, to be evaluated on a yearly basis, with reviews to be
conducted each quarter. The ``expedited'' review would move up the
quarterly evaluation by a week.
</P>
<P>
   The agenda for today's meeting notes the board will discuss
``public employee discipline/dismissal/release.''
</P>
<P>
   Board member David Tokofsky said he had not been told his
colleagues were considering moving up the superintendent's job
evaluation or broadening the scope of the impending review to
include Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do evaluate him, I assume it will be a formative
evaluation, not a summative _ or do or die _ evaluation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tokofsky, who represents a constituency composed largely of
Latino residents, took heat in June when he refused to support a
move by lame-duck school board members to extend Zacarias'
contract.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Zacarias threatened he would resign if the new
reform-minded school board, which would take office one week later,
put its ``political agenda'' ahead of the district's educational
goals.
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias pledged to give the new board a chance to evaluate his
performance in January, saying he'd waive his fourth year ``if the
board members feel they cannot support me.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the Mullinax report Tuesday, Zacarias denied any
wrongdoing and argued he took steps to gain control of the project
when he took office.
</P>
<P>
   The superintendent contended he quickly disbanded the Office of
Planning and Development, the branch overseeing the project.
However, the Office of Planning and Development was not disbanded
until February 1998, following the retirement of Dominic Shambra,
its director, eight months after Zacarias became superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Sales clarified Zacarias' statement Wednesday when asked about
the discrepancy. He said it took Zacarias time to shut the office
down.
</P>
<P>
   By several accounts, the Mullinax report took the school board
by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of well-thought-out decisions that need to be
made very soon,'' said board member Julie Korenstein. ``It's a lot
to digest and hard to respond to before we go through all the
materials.''

PINIELLA TAKES NOTE OF SINCLAIR'S HABIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ About halfway through his playing career,
Lou Piniella started taking notes. He kept a book detailing the
tendencies of the pitchers he faced and the way catchers called a
game, referring to it before he played and updating it regularly.
</P>
<P>
   As a manager, Piniella does the same thing, recording the
patterns of opposing managers, when they are likely to bunt, hit
and run, and so on. It is part of the preparation process, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to encourage that to our players,'' the Mariners
manager said. ``The more prepared you are, the better, and you use
these team meetings here just to augment what you already have.''
</P>
<P>
   It encouraged Piniella, then, to learn of a purchase made by
rookie left-hander Steve Sinclair during the Mariners' weekend
series in Baltimore. Sinclair bought a notebook of his own, and
started filling it with details on the hitters he faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, I just relied on the reports _ who was hot, who was
cold, and what our bullpen coach and pitching coach and advance
scout wrote out,'' Sinclair said. ``But that's what they saw
against a different pitcher, not against me. Now, I can have my own
personal notes on how (hitters) react to my pitching against them,
so I can use those.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinclair got the idea from casual conversations with Mariners
veteran Jamie Moyer, who has kept a book for about 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his career, with the Cubs and Rangers, Moyer, 36,
noticed the books hitters kept on pitchers. He didn't know exactly
how his teammates filled them out, but he thought it was worth a
try.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it helps, and it's a great reminder,'' Moyer said.
``But you still have to pitch. The book is just reminders, thoughts
and ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitters can change, you can change as a pitcher. But it's a
lot of thoughts and ideas and experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinclair has had few experiences in the majors, and not enough
positive ones for his liking. In 13 games since being acquired from
Toronto in the David Segui trade July 28, Sinclair has walked nine
and allowed 12 hits in nine innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know over the next two weeks, I have to perform to my
capabilities and show the organization they got the man they
thought they were getting, show them I'm definitely going to help
this ballclub out,'' he said. ``Pitching-wise, I just have to
concentrate on each hitter, go right after them and let my stuff
get them out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners will be watching his progress closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a nice arm,'' Piniella said. ``He's sneakier than I
thought he was. If he can master his control just a little bit more
and improve his breaking ball, there's no reason why he can't be a
usable left-hander out of the bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners appear likely to pursue a left-hander in free
agency, but a spot could still be available for Sinclair.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the left-handed hitters in this league, you need two
left-handers, one who's in a setup role where he can come in and be
a specialty pitcher, and one who can eat up 2-3-4 innings and keep
you in a ballgame,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA BASES: Right-hander Brett Hinchliffe, who relieved starter
Ken Cloude in the fourth inning, threw 22/3 scoreless innings
before leaving with discomfort in his rib cage. ... The Mariners
were without relievers Jose Paniagua (groin) and Tom Davey (forearm
tendinitis) Wednesday night. Paniagua said he expects to return
Thursday night. ... Right-hander Denny Stark made his major league
debut, striking out Bobby Smith on a slider before allowing three
singles. ``I'm a little disappointed that after I did get that
first strikeout, I wasn't able to finish the inning,'' Stark said.

   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Having already produced the greatest
evacuation in U.S. history, Hurricane Floyd skirted Florida and
Georgia on Wednesday and aimed itself directly at the low-lying
coastal border between the Carolinas, where its eye was expected to
come ashore early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Although no widespread damage from hurricane force winds or
waves was yet reported on the East Coast, gusts up to 79 mph began
knocking down power lines and blowing billboards across roadways on
Wednesday evening along the South Carolina coast. And with
sustained winds of more than 40 mph, falling trees began smashing
windows and roofs at several houses northeast of Charleston,
according to the police. At least 200,000 residents were without
power in the Charleston region, and repair crews had no plans to
begin work until the storm passed.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, the homes of those residents were empty,
as were all others in dozens of counties from Jacksonville, Fla.,
to Wilmington, N.C. Evacuation orders were in effect on Wednesday
for 2.6 million people, and with the majority of those residents
obeying the orders, federal emergency officials said the evacuation
had now become the nation's largest.
</P>
<P>
   One person died and a second was presumed dead in traffic
accidents in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   About 65 percent of Charleston's 87,000 residents had moved
inland, and Charleston County officials were amazed to report an 80
percent evacuation rate for the 230,000 people in the rest of the
county. The rate was far higher than for any previous hurricane,
and was attributed to the storm's enormous size and power, which by
evening appeared likely to spare the city. More than 90 percent of
neighboring Beaufort County was empty, according to county
officials, and 6,300 people were reported to be in shelters in a
three-county area.
</P>
<P>
   With the storm's eye moving to the north and east, residents of
North Carolina began adding to the exodus on Wednesday, filling up
hotels as far away as Alabama and Tennessee. The state government
ordered evacuations from the barrier islands around Wilmington, and
traffic began to clog the area just as heavy rains began falling at
midday. President Clinton declared coastal areas in the Carolinas
to be disaster areas, adding them to list of counties in Florida
and Georgia that were earlier made eligible for federal funds and
relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that Florida and Georgia at this point feel like
they've dodged a real bullet,'' said Richard Moore, the public
safety secretary for North Carolina. ``This thing is not going to
miss us.''
</P>
<P>
   The storm disrupted travel along the East Coast, as the Federal
Aviation Administration shut down control tower operations on
Wednesday at airports in Wilmington, N.C., Charleston, S.C., Myrtle
Beach, S.C, West Palm Beach, Fla., Daytona Beach, Fla. and
Jacksonville, Fla. Some airlines canceled flights as far away from
the storm as Richmond and Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, more than 80 Navy ships with an estimated 30,000
sailors, including three aircraft carriers, took to sea on
Wednesday from the Norfolk Naval Base to escape the storm. The
exodus took all day. Also 180 Navy and Air Force planes flew to
inland bases from the Oceana Naval Air Station in Virginia Beach
and Langley Air Force Base in Hampton, Va., to inland bases.
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation numbers were particularly high given the extreme
difficulty many residents had in leaving their homes on Tuesday,
because of massive congestion. South Carolina waited until
nightfall to make all lanes of the main interstate highway
westbound away from Charleston. Joseph P. Riley Jr., the mayor of
Charleston, charged the state with ``staggering incompetence,'' and
expressed concern that many of those who tried to leave wound up
returning, putting themselves in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Although Florida was spared the heaviest winds of the hurricane,
which weakened on Wednesday to 115 mph as the storm moved north,
areas around Daytona and Titusville reported numerous damaged roofs
and power lines. About 290,000 customers remained without
electrical power as many of the 1.3 million residents who followed
evacuation orders began returning to their homes. A popular pier in
Daytona collapsed when it was inundated by waves, but the state
insurance commissioner's office said there was no major damage
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   A 150-foot tugboat with eight crew members sank early Wednesday
345 miles off of Jacksonville. The Coast Guard said that
helicopters from the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy rescued all
eight crew members.
</P>
<P>
   The track of the storm left open the possibility that Floyd's
heavy winds and rain could continue north past the Carolinas into
Washington, D.C., New York City and even New England by the
weekend, even if it is not a hurricane at that point. Hurricane
force winds could reach the Chesapeake Bay by Thursday morning, and
federal emergency officials predicted significant tree damage in
Washington because of recent heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency told governors on
Wednesday afternoon that flooding as far north as New England
remains a high possibility through the rest of the week. Because so
much of the mid-Atlantic region is already saturated from Hurricane
Dennis, state agencies remain on high alert for inland river
flooding.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Already, an enormous swath of the country's East Coast was
virtually barren of visible human life. Charleston's historic
downtown was boarded up and deserted, the only movement the ominous
sway of trees and light poles. By 2 p.m., county police officers
had parked their cruisers and gone to shelters, and ambulances
stopped responding to any calls other than cardiac emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   In Horry County, which includes Myrtle Beach, officials reported
substantial flooding several hours before the center of the storm
passed offshore. Paul Whitten, the county's director of emergency
preparedness, said 11.5 inches of rain had accumulated in two days.
County officials were concerned that the worst of the storm was
expected to pass Myrtle Beach at the peak of high tide, at about
12:15 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The resort of Myrtle Beach had become an empty stage set of
abandoned hotels, seafood restaurants, waterslides and miniature
golf courses on Wednesday afternoon as the storm began to produce
significant swells in the Atlantic. Roads were empty and gas
stations, grocery stores and diners were boarded up and locked. One
facade of an old downtown building tumbled to the ground, and
police officers struggled to secure the exterior with plywood.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The usually animated beach town, a popular golf and retirement
destination, was projected to be very near the direct path of the
hurricane during the night, and though the storm's winds had
weakened to 115 mph from 140 mph the day before, officials were
still very worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be in the path of some of the strongest winds and
largest storm surges,'' said Cheryl J. Henry, a county spokeswoman.
A curfew went into effect at 3 p.m., and similar restrictions were
imposed on Charleston after dark.
</P>
<P>
   Further north, in Wilmington, which has been affected by 16
hurricanes in the last decade, officials began preparing for the
serious flooding that occurred in storms such as Bertha, Bonnie and
Fran. Life jackets were placed on all fire trucks to assist in
water rescues. Having just gone through a weeklong pounding from
Hurricane Dennis, North Carolina officials predicted ruinous beach
erosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to damage this beach like we have not seen since
Hazel,'' said Michael Stokes, a spokesman for Wrightsville Beach,
referring to the 1954 storm.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that it has been only a decade since Hurricane Hugo
came ashore in downtown Charleston, killing 13 people, producing a
17-foot surge, and costing South Carolina more than $6 billion,
city officials said they were amazed the state did not have a more
effective evacuation plan for the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Riley and other regional mayors were furious that the Department
of Transportation did not immediately allow fleeing residents to
use all lanes of I-26, as Georgia officials did with I-16 out of
Savannah. Some Charleston residents were on the road for 10 or 12
hours just to reach other parts of the small state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't rocket science,'' Riley said in an interview. ``What
the state Department of Transportation should have had in place and
could easily do is a system where you close lanes of traffic on one
part of the major highways and let people go out, because when you
have a major evacuation from a hurricane and you're requiring
people to leave, then that of a necessity means that people are not
coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jim Hodges, who was blamed by most angry radio-show callers
for the snail's pace of the evacuation, said his transportation
advisers questioned the safety of reversing lanes on the
interstate, but said he finally overruled them at about 8 p.m.
Tuesday. Nonetheless, the issue was likely to remain a political
blow for him _ one handmade sign on a I-26 overpass read, ``Flog
Hodges.''

JOEY STAYAWAY'S EGO WON'T LET LOGIC INTO PICTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Asked Wednesday if there were a threshold beyond which
the asset of Joey Galloway will be squandered for 1999, Mike
Holmgren glumly said, ``I suppose, but we're not there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The guess here is the threshold already has been crossed.
</P>
<P>
   Joey Stayaway really is going to stay away, for all of '99.
</P>
<P>
   On the local scale of self-destructive sports dumbness, it's not
quite a Vin Baker, but Galloway has eased past the Mariners owners
into second place.
</P>
<P>
   There was no news Wednesday on this frontier of absurdity. But
there has been an accumulation of small developments that indicate
the fiasco will put a fetching, fresh scar on a decade of Seahawks
futility.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Galloway smugly has gone public with what his agents
have been contending all along: The 27-year-old, nearing the peak
of his career, is prepared to sit out the season if he is not made
the NFL's richest receiver.
</P>
<P>
   His holdout will have reached two regular-season games Sunday
when the Seahawks play in Chicago. Since the NFL trading deadline
is Oct. 17, the Seahawks are down to one month to get him in or get
him gone to a team that can provide the Seahawks players for '99.
</P>
<P>
   Given the entrenchment of both sides, position changes seem
unlikely. Holmgren said Wednesday that his weekend call to
Galloway's agents went unreturned, just as with the previous calls
after Holmgren made a ``final'' proposal.
</P>
<P>
   After the Seahawks stepped on a rake in the season opener,
Galloway's already mammoth self-image went up another hat size. The
Seahawks are embarrassingly weak at his position, and the offensive
injuries Sunday ratcheted up the club's vulnerability. The Seahawks
could easily be 0-2 when they and most football observers figured a
2-0 start was likely.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the increased pressure, there is a third option, less
understood than either capitulation or trade. The Seahawks can let
him stew the whole year, and be in no worse position in the
off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Because Galloway has been placed by the Seahawks on the
``reserve _ did not report'' personnel category, the clock on his
contract is suspended. That means if he plays for the Seahawks or
any other team next year, he will be on the same fifth and final
year of his contract. He won't reach free agency by sitting out.
</P>
<P>
   During the off-season, Galloway's trade value will be higher,
because the salary cap will have risen, Galloway's first-year cost
will be relatively cheap, and more teams will be in position to
give him the extension he wants.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing Galloway in the next month limits the Seahawks' trade
partners, because most clubs are up against the cap. Even teams
that can afford Galloway will smell desperation, and make lowball
offers.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Seahawks, the third option means that they
will get little from Galloway in '99.
</P>
<P>
   The one help is that for each week Galloway sits out, the club
gains 1/16th of his $1.6 million salary against the cap (about
$93,000 a week).
</P>
<P>
   Whatever choice is made, the costs to both sides have exceeded
the values of their respective stands.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Seahawks understandably want to draw a line for
future renegotiations, the fact is the club can manipulate the
situation to disguise any ``give'' on their part, somewhat like
what they did for Warren Moon, who held out last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks had the hammer and eventually broke Moon, but they
let him brag it up as a victory to save face.
</P>
<P>
   Through bonuses, incentive clauses, voidable years and other
machinations, the Seahawks on any contract can work their way
around the appearance of capitulation.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway's position is even more recklessly stubborn. He wants
to be the game's highest-paid receiver for several years, but the
accomplishments of a non-all-star do not merit such a reward.
</P>
<P>
   The current Seahawks offer would make him the highest-paid
receiver behind Green Bay's Antonio Freeman, who not only has
better hands, runs better routes and plays hard all the time, but
also was a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Something beyond money and logic is driving Galloway.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his agent, Eric Metz, who also held out rookies Lamar
King and John Tait, is desperate to make a mark for his agency,
which has had player defections.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Galloway doesn't like Seattle and wants to be closer to
his Ohio home.
</P>
<P>
   Though professing to be excited about operating in Holmgren's
offense, maybe Galloway knows he won't push around Holmgren as he
did his predecessor, Dennis Erickson, who let Galloway take himself
out of games.
</P>
<P>
   Or it could be that Galloway has lost his guts to play.
</P>
<P>
   What's known for sure is that receivers don't get faster as they
get older and more beat up. For a guy whose game is based almost
entirely on speed, throwing away a season is costly in more
precious things than dollars.
</P>
<P>
   And for a team trying to sell significant change to a skeptical
football constituency, throwing away its only game-breaking player
is costly in more precious things than precedent.

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
And on the 13th day, the streak ended.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Phillies capitalized on a bullpen breakdown
Wednesday, scoring two runs in the 10th inning _ after pushing
across three in the eighth _ for an 8-6 victory at the Astrodome
that snapped the Astros' club-record 12-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' lead over second-place Cincinnati in the National
League Central Division was reduced to three games. The Reds beat
the Chicago Cubs 5-4 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After reeling off 12 straight victories _ the second-longest
streak in the majors this season _ the Astros suffered their first
loss since they fell to the New York Mets on Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Glanville had a career-high five hits as the Phillies
snapped an 11-game losing skid and won for just the second time in
20 games.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by two runs, the Astros tied the score at 6 in the
ninth inning of a game that featured three lead changes. Relievers
Jay Powell and Doug Henry combined to allow five runs and seven
hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're counting on Henry and Powell to be setup men. We can't
get it done with three starters and (Billy) Wagner,'' manager Larry
Dierker said. ``Obviously, I didn't push the right buttons
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen had not allowed a run in 19 innings prior to the
eighth inning. It was only the third time in 74 games the Astros
have lost when leading after the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   With the scored tied at 6, Glanville opened the 10th with a
single off Henry (2-3) and stole second. Following a one-out walk
to Bobby Abreu, Mike Lieberthal drove in the go-ahead run with a
double to left field. Rico Brogna added a run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros tied the game in the ninth with two runs off Wayne
Gomes (5-5) _ with help from shortstop Desi Relaford.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett led off with a single and stole second. Ken
Caminiti, who drove in three runs, rapped an infield single to deep
short that Relaford threw away, allowing a run to score. Jeff
Bagwell reached on an infield single, and Tony Eusebio walked
before Paul Bako grounded into a double play as Caminiti scored.
</P>
<P>
   With Bagwell representing the winning run on third, however,
Ricky Gutierrez grounded out to third base to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   After the Phillies regained the lead, Billy Brewer retired two
batters in the 10th for his first save of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, Relaford started a one-out rally with a double
into the right-field corner and pinch hitter Alex Arias tied the
game at 4 with a triple. Glanville and Lieberthal added run-scoring
singles.
</P>
<P>
   Glanville homered, doubled and singled three times to finish
5-for-6.
</P>
<P>
   The loss overshadowed a gutsy effort by Scott Elarton, who
struck out a career-high 10 batters as he overcame a career-high
five walks, including four in the third inning that put him in an
early hole.
</P>
<P>
   Bothered by a sore shoulder most of the second half of the
season, Elarton allowed three runs and five hits before leaving
after six innings with a 4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the winning streak) had to end sometime,'' Elarton said.
``Unfortunately, we had a lot of chances to win. We'll just have to
start another streak.''
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti hit a two-run homer to straightway center field in the
first inning and a sacrifice fly in the fifth that tied the score
at 3. Later in the inning, Lance Berkman gave the Astros the lead
with an RBI single to center on a ball Glanville caught up to but
failed to hold.
</P>
<P>
   Berkman was cut down trying for second base.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies scored in the second when Lieberthal walked and
came around on singles by Rico Brogna and Kevin Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Elarton's control problems put him on the ropes in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Glanville ripped a home run off the left-field scoreboard to
lead off and, following a strikeout of Ron Gant, Elarton walked
Abreu, Brogna and Jordan to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Marlon Anderson then walked to give the Phillies a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   From that point on, Elarton allowed only two hits while striking
out six of the next 10 batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Bill Spiers gave the Astros a spark when he slid
into first to beat out a bunt single. Everett followed with a
double to put runners in scoring position, and Caminiti and Berkman
produced the runs.

CRICKET MAKING HISTORY IN L.A.'S SAN FERNANDO VALLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Add another first for Los Angeles' San Fernando
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The first international cricket match broadcast live from North
America began Wednesday at Woodley Avenue Park in the Valley
community of Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   It drew only about 200 spectators. But organizers expect more
than half a billion people worldwide to tune in their TVs to watch
the five-day competition, with Woodley Park taking center stage as
perhaps the finest cricket field in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, the field is one of the few not to use artificial
turf _ a no-no on the cricket circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes years to develop a field like this,'' said Atul Rai,
president of the Southern California Cricket Association. ``It is
beautifully maintained with tight, low-cut grass and no artificial
turf.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is talk around the world that Los Angeles could be the
next cricket hot spot.''
</P>
<P>
   The match will be broadcast to scores of nations, including the
cricket-playing countries of England, Singapore, Australia and
Pakistan, Rai said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are billions of fans around the world,'' he said.
``They've been waiting for this for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Cricket is similar to baseball, but is played on a circular
field. The game uses bats, balls and pitchers _ called bowlers.
Like baseball, a player is ``out'' when a fielder catches a ball or
when a runner is tagged between bases.
</P>
<P>
   The object is for the batsman to protect two wickets _ bits of
wood balanced on top of three vertical poles _ from the bowler who
is attempting to knock them down. The batsman protects them by
hitting the ball and running between the wickets, like running
bases, to score points.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional games used to be held over a five-day period, but
most games now have been shortened to a one-day version, Rai said.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the five-day tournament between Australia and
India, the top two international teams, hope the historic event
will make Americans ``mad keen'' for what once was an upper-class
British game.
</P>
<P>
   But many local fans don't need to be sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe this is happening here. It's such a good
day,'' said cricket fan Sami Patel, 46. ``It's an exciting sport,
and to be able to come to an international event in the Valley is
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like the culmination of a dream, and it was a long
time coming,'' said Clifford Severn, 73, who has been playing
cricket in the Valley since he was 8 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need this to go big in Los Angeles, and the United States,
because people around the world look here for the best-of-the-best.
That will make it even bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Australian team captain Adam Gilchrist said he hopes the game
plants its American roots in Woodley Park _ and that the craze
catches on quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Americans fall in love with cricket, that will spring it
forward around the world,'' Gilchrist said. ``I think it can be
done here.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's kickoff of the AXN American Challenge, presented by
the International Cricket Council, was one of the most anticipated
international sporting events of the year, Rai said. The tournament
is sponsored by AXN, part of the Sony Television Group, which is
funding the $15,000 in prize money.
</P>
<P>
   The weeklong event comes complete with an Australian television
crew and a popular Australian announcer, Ian Chappell, who will
provide play-by-play analysis.
</P>
<P>
   While cricket fever hasn't caught on in Los Angeles, it's not
entirely foreign in Southern California. Schoolchildren from the
Sheenway School and Culture Center in Watts and from Allesandro
Elementary School in Silver Lake have had cricket programs for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the kids came to the opening day and showed their stuff
on the field while the players took a lunch break.

   ``I've been playing cricket for a year and it's really cool,''
said 9-year-old Jessica Santa Cruz from Allesandro Elementary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play because I want to learn a new game, not the boring old
sports,'' said 16-year-old Yvette Villalobos from Sheenway School.
``It's fun and it's just as exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the game's excitement, cricket teaches lessons in
morality, discipline and acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great game for kids to learn. There is rigid
discipline, and everyone is treated the same,'' Rai said. ``In the
game, if a player is out he can't even look at the referee funny or
he will be fined.''
</P>
<P>
   Dolores Sheen, executive director of the Sheenway School, said
cricket helps teach her students equity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to call it the common denominator. Everyone is equal in
cricket. There are no winners or losers,'' Sheen said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that cricket allows kids to keep the ``dignity'' that
other sports take away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football and basketball are so competitive and have racial and
skill divisions that aren't good to teach kids,'' Sheen said.
``There are no color barriers in cricket, and it emphasizes
involvement for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great game, and I hope it takes off here.''

CRICKET MAKING HISTORY IN L.A.'S SAN FERNANDO VALLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Add another first for Los Angeles' San Fernando
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The first international cricket match broadcast live from North
America began Wednesday at Woodley Avenue Park in the Valley
community of Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   It drew only about 200 spectators. But organizers expect more
than half a billion people worldwide to tune in their TVs to watch
the five-day competition, with Woodley Park taking center stage as
perhaps the finest cricket field in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, the field is one of the few not to use artificial
turf _ a no-no on the cricket circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes years to develop a field like this,'' said Atul Rai,
president of the Southern California Cricket Association. ``It is
beautifully maintained with tight, low-cut grass and no artificial
turf.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is talk around the world that Los Angeles could be the
next cricket hot spot.''
</P>
<P>
   The match will be broadcast to scores of nations, including the
cricket-playing countries of England, Singapore, Australia and
Pakistan, Rai said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are billions of fans around the world,'' he said.
``They've been waiting for this for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Cricket is similar to baseball, but is played on a circular
field. The game uses bats, balls and pitchers _ called bowlers.
Like baseball, a player is ``out'' when a fielder catches a ball or
when a runner is tagged between bases.
</P>
<P>
   The object is for the batsman to protect two wickets _ bits of
wood balanced on top of three vertical poles _ from the bowler who
is attempting to knock them down. The batsman protects them by
hitting the ball and running between the wickets, like running
bases, to score points.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional games used to be held over a five-day period, but
most games now have been shortened to a one-day version, Rai said.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the five-day tournament between Australia and
India, the top two international teams, hope the historic event
will make Americans ``mad keen'' for what once was an upper-class
British game.
</P>
<P>
   But many local fans don't need to be sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe this is happening here. It's such a good
day,'' said cricket fan Sami Patel, 46. ``It's an exciting sport,
and to be able to come to an international event in the Valley is
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like the culmination of a dream, and it was a long
time coming,'' said Clifford Severn, 73, who has been playing
cricket in the Valley since he was 8 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need this to go big in Los Angeles, and the United States,
because people around the world look here for the best-of-the-best.
That will make it even bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Australian team captain Adam Gilchrist said he hopes the game
plants its American roots in Woodley Park _ and that the craze
catches on quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Americans fall in love with cricket, that will spring it
forward around the world,'' Gilchrist said. ``I think it can be
done here.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's kickoff of the AXN American Challenge, presented by
the International Cricket Council, was one of the most anticipated
international sporting events of the year, Rai said. The tournament
is sponsored by AXN, part of the Sony Television Group, which is
funding the $15,000 in prize money.
</P>
<P>
   The weeklong event comes complete with an Australian television
crew and a popular Australian announcer, Ian Chappell, who will
provide play-by-play analysis.
</P>
<P>
   While cricket fever hasn't caught on in Los Angeles, it's not
entirely foreign in Southern California. Schoolchildren from the
Sheenway School and Culture Center in Watts and from Allesandro
Elementary School in Silver Lake have had cricket programs for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the kids came to the opening day and showed their stuff
on the field while the players took a lunch break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been playing cricket for a year and it's really cool,''
said 9-year-old Jessica Santa Cruz from Allesandro Elementary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play because I want to learn a new game, not the boring old
sports,'' said 16-year-old Yvette Villalobos from Sheenway School.
``It's fun and it's just as exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the game's excitement, cricket teaches lessons in
morality, discipline and acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great game for kids to learn. There is rigid
discipline, and everyone is treated the same,'' Rai said. ``In the
game, if a player is out he can't even look at the referee funny or
he will be fined.''
</P>

FIELDS AIRCRAFT TAKES COST-CUTTING ACTIONS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIMI VALLEY -- Fields Aircraft Spares Inc.'s 15-month-old move
from Van Nuys to Simi Valley, part of an ambitious expansion plan,
has hit serious turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   Fields, which replaces cabin interiors for commercial airliners,
announced Wednesday a cost-cutting program that includes plans to
sublease its headquarters and find a smaller facility in the area.
Currently, about 40 people work at the location at 4175 Guardian
St. in sales, warehousing, accounting and administration.
</P>
<P>
   Fields also reported a loss of $1.87 million in the first half
of the year as sales fell 5.8 percent to $10.73 million. Company
officials said its current woes are due to major airlines deferring
maintenance due to high demand for air travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interiors of a lot of cabins are getting pretty shabby,''
noted Alan Fields, president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   The cost-cutting represents a major reversal from the
bullishness of a year ago, when the company signed a 10-year, $8.6
million lease on the 122,000-square-foot plant as part of plans to
beef up the work force from 170 to 250.
</P>
<P>
   The company disclosed Wednesday that it has moved its
manufacturing operations to Monrovia and cut its staff nearly in
half _ from 234 to 126 employees, with most coming through layoffs
in manufacturing _ in the past six months. It estimated the move to
Monrovia and subleasing the Simi Valley headquarters would generate
$70,000 in monthly savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job cuts were a very unpleasant task,'' Fields said. ``We
are hoping to rehire people although they may not be willing to
work in Monrovia since most of them live in Ventura County.''
</P>
<P>
   Fields announced Wednesday that he has taken a 20 percent cut in
1999 salary to $200,000 while Chairman and Chief Administrative
Officer Peter Frohlich also reduced his compensation 20 percent to
$152,000.
</P>
<P>
   He also issued a bearish outlook for the third quarter, saying
service deferrals will continue and revenues will fall to between
$4.3 million and $4.7 million. But Fields predicted fourth-quarter
revenues will match first- and second-quarter levels of $5.3
million and $5.4 million, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's growth, which included revenues more than doubling
to $23.9 million, included purchases of Monrovia-based Skylock
Industries and Van Nuys-based Flightways Manufacturing as part of a
strategy to transform itself from a components supplier to an
all-in-one producer/supplier of cabin interiors.
</P>
<P>
   Fields announced in June it was seeking further acquisitions and
confirmed Wednesday that it continues to seek buying opportunities.
But in another negative development, it warned it might sell one of
its subsidiaries if it cannot obtain additional financing.
</P>
<P>
   Aerospace analyst Paul Nisbet of JSA Research said he was
uncertain about the prospects for the company. ``They may have been
overly optimistic in the past,'' he said. ``What they do should be
a fairly steady business since airplane seats get replaced every
seven years and there are 12,000 jets in service.''
</P>
<P>
   Fields stock, which was trading in the $7.50-a-share range a
year ago, has traded under $4 for the past three months. It closed
Wednesday up 18.75 cents to $2.5625.

GUNMAN KILLS 7 AND HIMSELF AT BAPTIST CHURCH IN FORT WORTH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for inserts, rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ As a hymn ended and prayers began at a special service
for teen-agers on Wednesday evening at a Baptist church in Fort
Worth, a man with a semiautomatic handgun walked in and began
firing, killing six people in the church before turning the gun on
himself. An eighth person died later at a hospital, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. David Ellis of the Fort Worth Police Department said three
teen-agers and three adults were shot to death inside the church in
the city's southwest corner. Ellis also said that a pipe bomb
exploded on a balcony inside the church sanctuary after the 7 p.m.
shooting and that the department's bomb squad was inspecting
several suspicious packages found at the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's cartridges, shrapnel and empty cart boxes and blood
splattered all over the wall,'' Ellis was quoted by The Fort Worth
Star-Telegram as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said there was a bulge in the gunman's chest and that bomb
disposal officers in protective suits would try to cut open his
clothing to look for an explosive device. Because of the potential
danger, he said, the victims' bodies had not been removed from the
church on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The dead gunman was wearing a black jacket-like windbreaker,
blue jeans, and white shirt, the lieutenant said, and appeared to
be about 35 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Millar, a young witness who was in the church, said that
when the shooting began, ``We all thought it was a part of a skit
about the meaning of life and learning how to face death.''
</P>
<P>
   Another witness, Lauren Tabor, 8, said she was in a class called
Girls in Action when she heard gunshots and screams, the
Star-Telegram reported. She said she and her classmates ran to
another room, where they pushed a table against the door ``so
nobody could get in. We were all down in a little corner.'' She
said the teacher then said, ``Let's pray.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth's acting police chief, Ralph Mendoza, said the man
had fired a semiautomatic handgun, and officers had found at least
three spent ammunition clips on the floor of the sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said that officers were uncertain how many people had
been in the church when the shooting occurred, even though the
local police officers arrived at the church within minutes.
</P>
<P>
   There was also some discrepancy about the number of people
wounded. While Pat Svacina, a spokesman for the city of Fort Worth,
said seven victims were in local hospitals, the hospitals accounted
for eight.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said that early in the night officers had taken a man into
custody as a suspect, but now considered him a witness. But he said
officials would not rule out his possible involvement in the
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Five students who were supposed to be at the event were
unaccounted for and officers were canvassing the neighborhood,
Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 8 p.m., police officers told reporters and
bystanders to move inside an elementary school across the street
from the church because of the explosives.
</P>
<P>
   A supervisor with the Fort Worth Police Department, S. Coe, said
officers evacuated the church, Wedgwood Baptist, and a bomb squad
swept the sanctuary for other explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Coe said the gunman arrived at the church shortly before 7 p.m.
and began firing. An estimated 150 teen-agers were attending the
weekly service for the annual ``See You at the Pole'' gathering,
where students affirm their faith and concern for the problems of
society by holding prayer time around their school's flagpole.
</P>
<P>
   Christy Martin, 17, told a local television station, KDFW, that
the man ``was very calm and looked normal and was smoking a
cigarette.'' She added that the gunman had walked into the
sanctuary, ``pulled a gun and began firing. I just saw him point
the gun and shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   A young man interviewed on CNN said the gunman paused at least
once to reload his gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just saw him keep shooting and reloading,'' said the man,
who was not identified. ``He'd empty it and then throw some more
bullets in there, and he kept shooting. I seen him sit down, he
kept walking back and forth in the very back aisle, and he kept
shooting straight. I was at the side between the door and the
window and he looked like he looked at me, so I got down and he
started shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   The shooting is the latest in a spate of mass killings. In July,
a disgruntled day trader, Mark Barton, walked into the Atlanta
stock firm where he had lost more than $105,000 and opened fire on
customers and employees before killing himself. Barton had killed
his wife and two children earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But that shooting was outside the relentless trend of shootings
at schools by students that has shaken the nation with tales of
violence involving young people and guns. In April, 15 people were
killed in Littleton, Colo., when two students went on a shooting
rampage at their high school. Then in May, six students were
injured in Conyers, Ga., when a student opened fire at Heritage
High School.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997-98 school year students were killed or wounded in
Pearl, Miss.; West Paducah, Ky.; Edinboro, Pa.; Jonesboro, Ark.,
and Springfield, Ore.

MIGHTY DUCKS NOTES

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It's one thing for a fresh-faced rookie to
catch the eye of a coach in training camp, but it's Teemu Selanne
who has impressed MightY Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg so far this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teemu has had a great camp, he's been a real leader, said
Hartsburg of Selanne, who scored a league-leading 47 goals and a
team-high 107 points in 1998-99. ``I think he really wants to take
the next step ... become a winner, a leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a superstar, but there is more for him to give and so far
he's giving it.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   Vitaly Vishnevski, 19, may represent the future of the Mighty
Ducks' defense, a physical player who has already displayed nasty
streak. Some have even compared his style to that of former Detroit
star Vladimir Konstantinov.
</P>
<P>
   Vishnevski's skills were on display in Anaheim's exhibition game
against San Jose Wednesday night, but Hartsburg said the team's No.
1 draft choice in 1998 (5th overall) will start the season at
Cincinnati of the American Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 19 years old and not ready, said Hartsburg when asked
why. ``He needs to develop at the right pace. He needs to play
25-30 minutes a game and that won't happen here.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks' other highly touted youngster, 20-year old winger
Maxim Balmochnykh, will also start the year in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   Without Paul Kariya, Selanne, Guy Hebert and Steve Rucchin in
Wednesday's lineup there wasn't a lot to keep the fans interested
from an Anaheim point of view. But a few made do by booing the
return of Gary Suter to the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   It was Suter's first appearance in Anaheim since he knocked
Kariya out for the season on Feb. 1, 1998 with a cross check to the
jaw.
</P>
<P>
   Suter, who missed the entire '98-99 season due to a staph
infection, has yet to play against Kariya since the incident.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Pascal Trepanier, who is coming off reconstructive
knee surgery, has yet to play in a game or scrimmage, but Hartsburg
said he is ``skating very well and could play in Monday's game
versus the Kings.

11 LAPD OFFICERS SUSPENDED IN POLICE PROBE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Eleven Los Angeles police officers have been
relieved of duty in a corruption investigation based partly on
allegations by an officer who pleaded guilty to stealing cocaine
from an evidence room at the LAPD's headquarters, Police Chief
Bernard C. Parks announced.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said the officers, including one from the San Fernando
Valley, were relieved from duty Wednesday as part of a continuing
investigation based on allegations that might involve drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at 12 to 13 officers who may be involved in
criminal or administrative charges,'' Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   He said one of the 13 officers already has been forced into
retirement, and another, Rafael Antonio Perez, pleaded guilty
earlier this month to possession with intent to sell cocaine in an
agreement with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, 32, agreed to cooperate with the Los Angeles Police
Department's corruption probe in exchange for a lighter sentence,
Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a significant amount of corruption that we're
concerned with, but I would not like to label the LAPD as
corruption-prone,'' the chief said. ``The fear is that all 12 of
them could be involved in criminal activities. . . . It's not a
good day.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks added that he hoped some of the suspended officers ``may
not even be involved.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Mayor Richard Riordan, members of the Los Angeles City
Council and the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office have
been notified of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Chief Michael Bostic, commanding officer of the Valley
Bureau, said one of the officers under investigation is stationed
in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   But all of the officers who were suspended worked at one time or
another at the Los Angeles Police Department's Rampart Division, an
area with a heavy immigrant population west of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the alleged criminal activities occurred both
within the LAPD and the community.
</P>
<P>
   All of the officers will be assigned to their homes with pay,
pending the outcome of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will not be allowed to participate in law enforcement
activities,'' Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   Parks also said the probe turned up information that could lead
to the reversal of a conviction of a man who was accused of
assaulting Perez and his partner, Officer Nino Durden, who has been
relieved from duty.
</P>
<P>
   The man who was convicted, Javier Ovando, was shot several times
by Rampart Division officers after he allegedly pointed a gun at
them. Ovando was 19 at the time.
</P>
<P>
   He was hospitalized with serious injuries and later convicted of
assault on police officers and sent to state prison, Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Perez's plea agreement, he said Ovando was not armed
and officers gave false information about the shooting, Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Perez) has given us sufficient information to cause us to
believe that much of the information that was initially offered was
false,'' Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're saddened anytime a Los Angeles officer or an officer in
general tarnishes his badge and brings a dark mark on law
enforcement . . . We have to bring the officers involved in this
conduct and criminal activity to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office is now seeking
to have Ovando released from state prison, possibly today, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1998, Parks announced the arrest of Perez, who was
charged with possession of cocaine for sale, grand theft and
forgery in an alleged March 2, 1988, theft of six pounds of cocaine
from an evidence storage area at the LAPD's Parker Center
headquarters. Police said the cocaine had a street value of about
$800,000.
</P>
<P>
   A mistrial was declared in the case in June when jurors
announced a majority of them favored conviction but were
deadlocked. Instead of facing another trial, Perez pleaded guilty
to four counts of grand theft and possession of cocaine for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Perez spent more than a year in jail, where he remains on
$700,000 bail. He is scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 22.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Perez had been partners with recently
convicted bank robber David Anthony Mack.
</P>
<P>
   Both men were nine-year LAPD veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Mack was credited with saving Perez's life by killing a drug
dealer in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Mack was convicted in March on federal charges of robbing a Bank
of America branch of $722,000 on Nov. 6, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A teller with whom Mack was having an affair helped him get past
bulletproof doors at the bank near the University of Southern
California.

DREIFORT AS GAME SLIPS AWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With everything that went wrong this season, the
Los Angeles Dodgers might have lost their mental health, but
physically, among the regulars, they remained healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Then right-hander Darren Dreifort left his start mid-batter in
the fifth inning Wednesday night with tightness in his pitching
shoulder. He will be evaluated today and his status for his next
start is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's fine,'' said Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone, who
was on the phone before Dreifort reached the top step of the
dugout. ``It's day to day, but we believe with an off-day
(today)... he'll be able to make his next start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see how he feels. We're not going to risk the future of
one of our starters in the last two weeks of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   For the diehards, the Montreal Expos scored seven times in the
sixth and beat the Dodgers 10-7 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Grudzielanek left with a bruise on his right hand after
being hit with a pitch in the sixth inning. It's the same hand he
broke in June. He is listed as day to day.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, making sure Dreifort wasn't seriously injured was the
Dodgers' top priority.
</P>
<P>
   After a lengthy discussion with manager Davey Johnson and
trainer Charlie Strasser, Dreifort left after 63 pitches. There was
a runner on first and an 0-1 count to Trace Coquillette.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort's in the midst of his best season as a professional. He
was in the midst of his best stretch since converting to a starter
last season, but Malone felt that was part of the problem.
Dreifort, 27, is also approaching a career-high in innings pitched
and has averaged better than 72/3 innings in his last five starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be just fatigue,'' Malone said. ``He's pitched a lot
lately. He's been going eight or nine innings in his starts. He's
not used to that. I'm sure it's just that his shoulder is a little
tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Excuse the Dodgers if they're quick to remove Dreifort when he
feels the slightest bit of discomfort, but they have good reason.
Anything pertaining to his pitching arm is going to be closely
scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort missed the 1995 season after having reconstructive
surgery to repair a torn medial collateral ligament in his right
elbow, and the arm hasn't bounced back quickly after pitching
performances.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort pitched a career-high 180 innings last season, which is
was more innings then he amassed in his previous three major-league
seasons. But Dreifort didn't pitch after a Sept. 4 start against
San Francisco because of soreness in his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   This has been a breakout season for Dreifort. The right-hander
is 13-13, and with one more victory, will match his career-win
total entering the season. And though his 4.79 ERA doesn't reflect
it, Dreifort has pitched so well lately that Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said Dreifort will return to the rotation next year.
</P>
<P>
   After pitching four-plus innings against the Expos at Chavez
Ravine, Dreifort's inning total was 1782/3. He's already made a
career-high 29 starts.
</P>
<P>
   But the disappointing thing for the Dodgers is that Dreifort's
being removed from the game means they'll have to keep a closer eye
on his the rest of this season, if he returns. His final few starts
were also supposed to work toward his development as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort began his run of success with a complete-game shutout
against Florida on Aug. 18. It started a stretch in which he won
four of five starts and had a 2.08 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving with tightness in his shoulder against the Expos,
Dreifort had pitched at least seven innings in each of his last
five starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos were shaping up to be the sixth in that line. Dreifort
allowed a one-out RBI single to Michael Barrett that tied the score
1-1 in the second inning, but the Dodgers took a 2-1 lead in the
bottom of the inning when Dreifort scored on right-fielder Vladimir
Guerrero's throwing error.

RED SOX TRIPS ENDS EXTRA SPECIAL 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-INDIANS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ After 13 days, a dozen games, nearly 7,000 air miles
and waking up one too many mornings in strange hotel rooms trying
to recall what city they were in, the road-weary Sons of Jimy
Williams ended their longest trip of the season with their longest
night.
</P>
<P>
   But their willingness to work overtime _ the Red Sox came from a
run behind in the ninth to tie the score on Trot Nixon's sacrifice
fly and stayed alive on a play in the 11th by forgotten Jeff Frye _
ended not only in exhaustion but exhilaration.
</P>
<P>
   Home runs by Jason Varitek, the ironman catcher who barely had
enough energy left to circle the bases, and rookie Trot Nixon in
the 13th inning Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night lifted the Sox to a 6-4 win over
the Cleveland Indians, who will be their first-round playoff
opponents if matters remain status quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing hard, that's about all we can do,'' said
Varitek, who singled in the ninth to put pinch runner Donnie Sadler
in position to score the tying run on Nixon's fly ball, then broke
a 4-4 tie when he just cleared the right-field wall with his 17th
home run, off loser Jim Brower (1-1). ``Play hard and try to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Indians) don't have to win right now. They're already
locked in (to a playoff spot). They're able to let things happen.
There's no pressure on them to win, so they're a little free and
easy about things. We have to win.''
</P>
<P>
   On a night when ace Pedro Martinez struck out 14 batters in
seven innings but saw his bullpen unable to protect a one-run
advantage, the Sox emptied their bench to beat the Indians in the
rubber game of this three-game set.
</P>
<P>
   And on a trip they expected to give definition to their October
aspirations, the Sox compiled a 9-3 record for a 3 1/2-game lead
over idle Oakland in the wild-card race. With 16 games left,
including the next 10 at home, the Sox are 3 1/2 games behind the
Yankees in the AL East.
</P>
<P>
   ``People know when they play the Red Sox, they're in for a
battle,'' said Frye. ``We may not be the best team on paper, but
that team doesn't always win.''
</P>
<P>
   Frye, who has been buried deep on the Sox bench since forcing
the team to recall him from injury rehabilitation at the start of
the month, entered as a pinch runner in the 10th, remained in the
game at second base, and made a diving stop with two on and two out
in the 11th on Omar Vizquel's bid for a winning hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't forgotten Frito, he's never forgotten,'' Martinez
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does this game say? We never give up. We've shown it the
whole year. We're a little team, and we're overlooked a lot because
we don't have the big names, but we have players who never give
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's home run was his fourth in the last five games,
including one in each of the three games here. The home runs by
Varitek and Nixon made a winner out of John Wasdin (8-3), the fifth
Sox pitcher, who finished with a Martinez-like flourish, striking
out three Indians in his two innings after spelling Rod Beck.
</P>
<P>
   Beck, who entered in the ninth, pitched three innings for only
the second time since Oct. 4, 1992, and first time since he went
three against the Dodgers Sept. 18, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felt pretty good,'' Beck said. ``Got the elbow working. Let's
see how fast this time I blow it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the conspiracy theory put forth by Williams after the
first game of this series, there was no electronic eye in center
field Wednesday night, tipping off the Indians what pitches
Martinez was throwing.
</P>
<P>
   These days, of course, it's an open question whether that would
be an advantage. Chances are Martinez could hold up flash cards on
the mound, or have it broadcast over the public address system what
was coming plateward, and most hitters still wouldn't have a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians were no different than anybody else
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night, though they did something no team has been able
to do against Martinez in almost two months.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland pushed two runs across in one inning, the fourth,
ending a string of 51 innings, spanning eight starts, in which
Martinez had allowed no more than a run.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians then waited until Martinez departed to take a 4-3
lead, scoring twice in the eighth against relievers Rheal Cormier
and Rich Garces. Cormier gave up a two-out single to Jim Thome, his
old hunting buddy. After pinch runner David Roberts stole second,
Garces walked Richie Sexson on a full count, then gave up an
opposite-field double off the left-field wall to Tyler Houston, who
has had just 10 at-bats with the Indians since arriving from the
Cubs in a waiver deal Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Houston was playing in place of regular third baseman Travis
Fryman, who was given a powder against Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, however, rallied to tie in the ninth against Indians
closer Mike Jackson. Scott Hatteberg, serving as designated hitter
for the first time this season and becoming the ninth DH to start
for Williams in 1999, beat out an infield hit to deep short, his
second infield hit of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Has Hatteberg, a catcher by trade, ever had two infield hits in
a game?
</P>
<P>
   ``What is that, a rhetorical question?'' he cracked.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler ran for Hatteberg and sped to third on Varitek's single
through the right side. Pinch hitter Reggie Jefferson struck out,
but Nixon delivered Sadler with his fly ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get him early,'' Nixon said of Jackson. ``He's got
that slider and splitter, so that's why I jumped on the first
pitch. I knew all I needed was a fly ball with Donnie over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams used 15 position players, winding up with an infield of
Offerman at first, Frye at second, and Lou Merloni at third.
Offerman had given Martinez a 2-0 lead with a two-run homer off
Bartolo Colon in the third, then after the Indians tied it in the
fourth on a double, a bunt single, an infield hit, and a sacrifice
fly, Offerman's infield out after two walks and a wild pitch put
the Sox ahead in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been proud of them all year,'' Williams said of his team.
``This is our longest trip, I guess. But the main thing is we can't
let up. We can take a day off tomorrow, but then we have to get
prepared to play another team.''

FANS TREATED TO ALL THE SIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ It took 14 strikeouts and 131 pitches from Pedro. It
took a ninth-inning, tying sacrifice fly from Trot Nixon. It took a
sliding 11th-inning catch by Damon Buford. It took a game-saving
dive, pop up, and throw by Jeff Frye (making his first appearance
of a two-week trip in the 10th inning of the 12th and final game).
It took four relief pitchers. It took solo home runs in the 13th
inning by Jason Varitek and Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   It took every bit of Jimy Williams's managerial acumen. It took
15 position players. It took 4 hours 40 minutes. It took the last
hours of Wednesday and the first quarter hour of Thursday. But it
was all worth it.
</P>
<P>
   A 13-inning, 6-4 victory over the Cleveland Indians to wrap up a
9-3 road trip? Who's kidding whom?
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I think we'd go 9 and 3?'' inquired Pedro Martinez, whose
seven innings of two-run ball resulted in his third no-decision of
the season. ``Yes, I would have said it was possible. It was a
matter of staying focused and staying healthy, and we did that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox left home two weeks ago Thursday two games ahead of
the Oakland A's in the wild-card race. They return up by 3 1/2.
They won three in Seattle, one in Oakland, three in New York, and
two in Cleveland. It will go down as one of the great road trips in
Red Sox history. Regardless of what happens from here on out _ and
with the perilous state of their starting pitching beyond Pedro,
anything could happen _ no one will ever be able to take away from
this gritty bunch the grandeur of a 9-3 September road trip,
culminating in what can only be described as a pennant race epic.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox were four outs away from victory, leading by a 3-2
score with two away and no one on base in the eighth. But Jim Thome
bounced a single through the hole, chasing Rheal Cormier. Williams
summoned the usually reliable Rich Garces, but Richie Sexson worked
him for a base on balls and Tyler Houston brought both base runners
home with a double off the left-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   The fun was just beginning. Scott Hatteberg, strangely inserted
as the designated hitter, led off the ninth with an infield single
to short. Varitek, rapidly gaining the reputation as the team's
``Mr. Clutch,'' rammed a single to right, sending pinch runner
Donnie Sadler to third. After pinch hitter Reggie Jefferson fanned,
Nixon hit the first pitch he saw from Cleveland closer Mike Jackson
for a professional sacrifice fly to center.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Beck worked the next three innings, but not without a little
drama. The great moment of trepidation came when Enrique Wilson hit
a low liner to center with one away in the 11th. Buford, a fearless
chap, came racing in, sliding on his keister while blowing a bubble
as the ball settled into his glove. Had he missed the ball, Mr.
Wilson had a three-bagger, minimum, and maybe even an
inside-the-parker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a reaction,'' explained Buford, who also claimed he had
no idea about the bubble-blowing bit until someone told him they
had seen it on TV.
</P>
<P>
   The catch looked even bigger when Einar Diaz and Kenny Lofton
followed with singles. That brought up the dangerous Omar Vizquel,
who already had three hits, and who had tormented Pedro way back
when by working him for 18 pitches in his first two at-bats.
Vizquel smashed a ball to Frye's left, and this baby definitely had
RBI single inscribed all over it.
</P>
<P>
   But Frye ranged to his left, hit the deck, caught the ball, and
threw out the speedy Vizquel by a half-step at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to keep it in the infield,'' Frye shrugged.
``If I get him out, it's a bonus, right there.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving two on in the 12th, the Red Sox moved into the
13th against righthander Jim Brower. The leadoff man was Varitek,
who had just caught 12 innings and what appeared to be 11,432
pitches. He could have been forgiven had he taken three gentlemanly
swings and then returned to the dugout. Instead, he whacked an 0-1
offering into the right-field seats for his 17th home run of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't enough ways to describe what Jason has meant to
this team,'' gushed Martinez. ``I'd say he's right there with Nomar
for the most valuable player on the club. If I had to choose, it
would be a very tough decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason is unbelievable,'' agreed Buford. ``He's the Iron Horse
back there.''
</P>
<P>
   The win went to John Wasdin, the early-season good luck charm
whose entrance into a game usually causes Fenway regulars to reach
for the cyanide pellets. But this time Wasdin was The Man, working
two very nice innings.
</P>
<P>
   This victory was a true Jimy Williams special. ``We got
contributions from a lot of people,'' he pointed out. ``But that's
why they have the expanded rosters, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   So much happened after Pedro departed that you almost forgot he
had casually fanned 14 men in his seven innings. But it was Pedro
himself who summed up the real meaning of both the team's 84th
victory of the season and the spectacular 9-3 road trip. ``This
game shows how we never give up,'' he declared. ``We're a little
team, always underrated. We always play as a team. We keep on
proving it, and proving it, and proving it.''
</P>
<P>
   By that time it was well into Thursday morning, and there was
nothing anyone could say to challenge him. The game and the trip
had spoken for themselves.

COPS PROTECT S.F. FROM SANDWICHES
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ You can still find drugs, cheap booze, cheaper
sex and assorted trouble and misery in the Tenderloin and around
the Civic Center. But for now, folks who live in and drift through
that part of town are safe from the menace of the Saturday
Free-Lunch Gang.
</P>
<P>
   After seven years, the cops finally launched an overdue
crackdown on a group of high school kids from the mean streets of
Marin who sneak across the bay every Saturday and hand out
sandwiches to the homeless in Civic Center and U.N. plazas.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, a student at the Branson School, a private
school in Ross, noticed that she and her friends usually had food.
She also noticed that homeless people in San Francisco often
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   So she and friends started ``Homeless Sandwiches.'' Every Friday
afternoon, they made hundreds of sandwiches, and every Saturday
morning, they took the ferry to the city, set up tables in one of
the plazas and fed 300 or so people. Free.
</P>
<P>
   Until last Saturday, when a police SWAT unit (Sandwich Worker
Assault Team) swooped in.
</P>
<P>
   One officer told the kids they had to move it, sorry, but orders
from above. Another, also friendly, told 'em the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   So the gang moved out of Civic Center Plaza, a couple blocks to
Hyde &AMP; McAllister, and set up shop.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, no fewer than seven police officers and a
lieutenant arrived at the crime scene and shut down the notorious
sandwich gang.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 students and four adults were told they didn't have the
proper permits and were committing several health code violations.
</P>
<P>
   One police officer got into the food line and said that by the
time he got to the front of the line, the operation better be shut
down.
</P>
<P>
   So they split. ``Homeless Sandwiches'' suddenly found itself
holding about 500 homeless sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   The big question is why the cops let this gang run wild in the
inner city for seven years, terrorizing inhabitants with free
lunches.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Police Lt. Paul Chignell, who recognized the
danger these kids posed to the community and spearheaded the
shutdown task force, referred me to his captain, saying, ``I don't
talk to The Chronicle.''
</P>
<P>
   Guess who just got crossed off my Christmas-card list?
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Fred Lau said that he was looking into the
situation and that he told one student's parent, ``It's not a crime
to feed the homeless.'' He vowed to help the students get needed
permits and said he would urge his officers to act with
``compassion and common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Willie Brown's spokesperson, Kandace Bender, said the
mayor is absolutely in favor of people, especially young people,
getting involved in civic-minded volunteer projects.
</P>
<P>
   But Bender said the students would be encouraged to go to an
established agency like, for example, Glide Memorial Church, and
volunteer their services, so people who come for meals can also be
exposed to a full range of services to assist the down-and-out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor's office is happy to find a way to help them put
their energy and contributions to use,'' Bender said, ``because
those are admirable qualities. If they want to contact the mayor's
office, we're happy to work with them, find a place where they can
distribute food.''
</P>
<P>
   The student coordinator of ``Homeless Sandwiches,'' senior
Morgan Cosby, says she has worked at Glide and isn't interested in
going that route.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're people helping people,'' she says. As opposed to people
helping other people help people.
</P>
<P>
   I could write a book about what I don't know about high school
students, but I know this: They don't like to be patted on the head
and told to report to the nearest adult.
</P>
<P>
   High school kids aren't kids. They are new adults who are
stumbling along, discovering incredible and creative ways to screw
up and to do good. On their own.
</P>
<P>
   Society keeps asking, ``What do high school students do when
they're not machine-gunning one another down in the hallways?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Homeless Sandwiches'' was one answer to that question.
</P>
<P>
   It's the students' thing, this little sandwich giveaway. They
invented it, they've kept it going, with minimal adult help.
</P>
<P>
   But after talking to Bender, the Health Dept. and the P.D., I'm
convinced that the city's master plan is to get these kids off the
streets and into a shelter.
</P>
<P>
   What will happen now is that either the cops and the city work
with the students and let them resume their sandwich biz under
their own leadership, or ... well, high schoolers can be a terrible
pain in the rear.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked Cosby what will happen next Saturday, she said,
``We're going back and serving again.''
</P>
<P>
   I hope this gets worked out, that it doesn't come down to
sandwich-sniffing dogs and tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   But if these young folks do get busted, instead of being sent up
the river, maybe they can be enrolled in a sandwich offender
diversion program.

 S.F. MAYOR REGALES D.C. WITH TALES OF THE CITY  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the nation's capital to raise money for his
re-election, Mayor Willie Brown painted an uproarious picture of
San Francisco politics Wednesday to a rapt audience of Washington
dignitaries who paid $500 each to see the performance.
</P>
<P>
   Brown mixed anecdotes and one-liners from his four-year journey
into municipal government before members of Congress, a Cabinet
secretary, the head of the AFL-CIO, the mayor of Washington, D.C.,
and other supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mineola, you only get bitten by one snake,'' he said,
referring to his hometown in Texas. ``In San Francisco, there are
780,000 of them that bite you.''
</P>
<P>
   To sustained laughter, Brown complained of his difficult
transition from state to local politics and described the 67
debates he participated in during his 1995 mayoral campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixty-seven debates _ with the same damn audience,'' he said.
``These people have no life. They just show up for anything
political. ... Now I don't have 67 stories. I don't have 67
responses. I just kept making s_ up.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown revealed his secret to answering questions to which he
doesn't know the answer: ``I use a little bit of ebonics ... and
then come to the punch line.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor poked fun at his rivals _ former Mayor Frank Jordan
and political consultant Clint Reilly _ and explained why he was
more combative in the second of two recent mayoral debates.
</P>
<P>
   In the first debate, which he described as ``mud wrestling,''
Brown said he calmly endured the ``vicious'' attacks of his
opponents because he wanted to remain above the fray.
</P>
<P>
   The next day the local media accused him of acting ``imperial,''
and during a walk through the Fillmore _ ``that's the 'hood,'' he
explained _ he noticed that African Americans were turning their
back on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the matter?'' Brown asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You let those white boys kick your ass,'' they responded.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he did not want to be seen as ``some sort of cream
puff,'' so he made sure he was ready to fight back in the second
debate and even packed the audience with his own vocal supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had everyone who could get a work furlough,'' he said to
laughter, adding that the next day he was attacked by the media for
nearly inciting a riot.
</P>
<P>
   ``My work is cut out for me,'' he said, bemoaning his relations
with the local press.
</P>
<P>
   About 65 people attended the event at the posh Mayflower Hotel,
munching on muffins and cantaloupe as Brown delivered his 20-minute
monologue. The fund-raiser was put together by Eve Maldanado, San
Francisco's Washington lobbyist. A $500 contribution was requested,
though organizers said they did not know how much money was raised.
</P>
<P>
   Among the event's hosts were California Sens. Dianne Feinstein
and Barbara Boxer, and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.
None was present.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein _ who, as San Francisco's mayor, appointed Frank
Jordan as police chief in 1986 and endorsed him for re-election in
the 1995 mayoral campaign against Brown _ endorsed Brown earlier
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   During his talk, Brown also gave a litany of anecdotes of his
encounters with San Francisco residents.
</P>
<P>
   He told of the woman who woke him up at 2:30 a.m. to complain
that her streetlight wasn't working. Brown said he took her number
and told her not to worry. After making certain the light was
working the next night, Brown set his alarm for 2:30 a.m. and
phoned the woman back, just to make sure her problem was solved.
</P>
<P>
   Brown told of a debate in the Mission neighborhood where a dog
owner told him that the community was deeply divided over whether a
neighborhood park should be used for ``off-leash'' dog runs or for
children playing soccer. He then demanded the mayor's position.
</P>
<P>
   After a moment of ``total and complete panic,'' Brown said he
responded: ``Be kind, I'm really trying to keep my job. And there's
no way I can keep my job if I answer this question.''
</P>
<P>
   And he told a story of a forum in Bernal Heights, where a woman
kept complaining that she had to wait too long to get her
prescription filled at her local drug store. The woman persisted
after Brown repeatedly told her he could do nothing about it.
Finally, Brown said he interrupted the event to tell her: ``Ma'am,
you've convinced me _ you absolutely need your medication.''
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, Brown posed with members of the California
delegation who had served with him in the Assembly, including Reps.
Barbara Lee, D-Oakland; Maxine Waters, D-Los Angeles; Sam Farr,
D-Carmel; Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Los Angeles; and Grace
Napolitano, D-Norwalk.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco; Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.;
Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas; and Chaka Fattah, D-Pa., also attended
the event. Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater was on hand to
pay his respects, saying Brown was a perfect ambassador for San
Francisco.

 GORE DISPLAYS ENDORSEMENTS ON EVE OF VISIT  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
On the eve of his 59th trip to California, Vice President Al Gore
has released a list of new endorsements for his 2000 presidential
bid from state congressional leaders _ including U.S. Sen. Dianne
Feinstein.
<P>
   Gore's campaign had been the target of recent criticism from GOP
leaders saying he lacks the thick roster of endorsements compiled
by Republican front-runner Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But his two-day trip beginning Thursday, to include stops in Los
Angeles, Fresno and San Francisco, is designed in part to showcase
the formal endorsement of Gov. Gray Davis _ who will tour
California with him _ as well as other state Democratic leaders.
Gore will speak to the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce,
visit a public high school and speak to labor leaders during his
state trip.
</P>
<P>
   Among the members of the California Democratic congressional
delegation who announced their formal endorsements of Gore's
presidential campaign Wednesday were Lois Capps of Santa Barbara,
Gary Condit of Modesto, Julian Dixon of Los Angeles, Bob Filner of
Chula Vista, Tom Lantos of San Mateo, Barbara Lee of Oakland, Bob
Matsui of Sacramento, Ellen Tauscher of Walnut Creek and Mike
Thompson of Napa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows they have seen the type of leadership that Al Gore
has brought to this country and ... the working families of
California,'' said Gore spokesman Roger Salazar Wednesday. ``They
recognize the vice president has a serious commitment to standing
up for the issues that are important to the people of California _
and he'll continue to do so as president.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has previously won the endorsement of U.S. Sen. Barbara
Boxer, as well as state Democratic U.S. Reps. Xavier Becerra of Los
Angeles, Howard Berman of Mission Hills, Cal Dooly of Hanford, Zoe
Lofgren of San Jose, Matthew Martinez of Alhambra, Juanita
Millender-McDonald of Torrance, Grace Napolitano of Norwalk and
Lucille Roybal-Allard of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein has long expressed her support of Gore's 2000
presidential bid, but made her endorsement formal Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vice President Al Gore has demonstrated time and time again he
is dedicated to the people of the United States _ be it reducing
gun violence, protecting our environment, bolstering patients
rights, safeguarding a woman's right to choose or reforming public
education,'' said Feinstein in a statement released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   She lauded Gore as ``a leader with a proven record of fighting
on our behalf,'' saying, ``He has also demonstrated a strong
commitment to my home state of California _ helping our schools,
funding job programs, &LR;  and promoting the development of high-tech
industries that have fueled our economic growth.''  &LR;

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Deteriorating language, deteriorating discourse
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The question for today is: Is what passes for public discourse
in this country ruining the English language, or is what passes for
the English language in this country ruining public discourse?
</P>
<P>
   The answer _ and here, in a most unwriterly manner, I blow any
chance of creating suspense that just might sustain reader pursuit
of the outcome _ the answer is I don't know. On the other hand, I
do care.
</P>
<P>
   There are two increasingly annoying cases in point _
``experimenting with drugs'' and ``the gay lifestyle.'' Actually,
three. We'll get to the third in a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experimenting with drugs'' is verbal murk invented by
politicians who have been found out or who, confessing and of
course contrite, want to pre-empt before they are outed.
</P>
<P>
   Look, people who experiment with drugs work in laboratories and
wear white coats and do strange and perhaps untoward things to mice
who don't know what hit them.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody else has either used drugs _ some more, some less _ or
hasn't used drugs. No politician _ none, not one _ ever
experimented with drugs. They either smoked or snorted or shot up
dope, or rolled around naked in it for all I know, or they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   (There is, sort of, a third way. I am the only person on Earth
who believes the student Bill Clinton really didn't inhale. It
would be just like him. ``Gee, all the others are toking and I
don't want to look like a square but one day I'll run for high
office, so _ oops. Here comes the joint. I know what I'll do!'')
</P>
<P>
   For the record, and to be completely honest, I want to say
plainly here that I have never experimented with drugs. I don't
even own a white coat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gay lifestyle'' is another of those
nails-on-the-blackboard screechers that shrivel the spinal cord.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase is a dodge that seems somehow to be pretending to
politesse but is only an avoidance, a prissy way of not saying
someone is homosexual but is ``living the gay lifestyle.'' As if
living in Chicago, say, were not quite the same as being a
Chicagoan.
</P>
<P>
   There is no gay lifestyle. (There is a Chicago.) Some gays are
rich, some poor. Some are flamboyant, some mousey. Some have been
with their partners for decades; some play the field. Some sell
insurance; some work high steel.
</P>
<P>
   And, while we're at it, no one ``happens'' to be gay. You might
happen to be in Miami when it rains, but you don't happen to be
gay, or black or Jewish. These are not atmospheric randoms that
strike folks here and there, like falling tree limbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happens'' _ the third case in point _ is a patronizing and
pitying word deployed by majorities to half excuse minorities for
inconsiderately failing to be one of them: The poor dears can't
help it.
</P>
<P>
   For the record again, I do not happen to be white. My parents
planned it this way.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE _ In a recent column, I wrote that federal agents were
killed trying to serve arrest warrants on the Branch Davidian cult
in Waco. The agents had an arrest warrant prepared but were serving
a search warrant.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Staying prepared for hurricanes
 &HT;    (For release Sept. 19, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ We are the lucky ones; Hurricane Floyd gave South
Florida the brushoff and headed for points north. But, as the good
people of the Carolinas are aware, you can't let your guard down _
two storms, Dennis and Floyd, in less than one month with half a
hurricane season still to go.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, whatever state of preparedness my home is in
today (for Floyd) will stay that way until such time as I sense a
seasonal all-clear. In anticipation of Hurricane Floyd, our
shutters went up, the patio furniture was moved into the living
room, potted plants and hoses relocated to the garage and pounds
upon pounds of useless patio junk stuffed into drawstring kitchen
bags in hope that my wife soon will allow me to move it out to the
curb for garbage pickup.
</P>
<P>
   With another hurricane, Gert, lurking near the Antilles,
anything is possible, despite weather forecasters predicting Gert
will turn north and on to oblivion. And so I maintain my
self-imposed ``red alert'' _ except for the plants, which I moved
outside.
</P>
<P>
   It would appear, though, that many in South Florida are standing
in place as well. In my neighborhood, which was ground zero during
Hurricane Andrew in 1992, most homes still have their shutters up,
and while I did not go around to sneak a peek at patios, I would
surmise that the redwood chaise lounge from the pool area is now
stationed in some hallway until the hurricane season wanes.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing for a hurricane is a totally arduous task, followed by
the mental anguish as the storm gets closer. In readying my home
for Floyd, I spent the better part of two days putting up shutters,
lugging plants and taking down flower boxes, and just when I
thought I was through, there was something else.
</P>
<P>
   The freezer is filled with gallon-sized jugs of water, not for
drinking but for keeping the freezer cold if and when the power
goes out. I'm not going to remove them, either; not until all those
orange and red splotches disappear from the Weather Channel's radar
image.
</P>
<P>
   (As an aside on hurricane fashion, it has not escaped my notice
that television reporters standing at the gusty beach fronts or
before downed trees are wearing blue rain gear this year. Even
CBS's Dan Rather, who dashed down to the Carolinas for
I-was-there-too reporting, was in blue, as were most of the Weather
Channel's reporters. Last year, the dominant TV reporter
costume/slicker was yellow.)
</P>
<P>
   Although we in South Florida were spared Floyd, there remain
some questions in my mind about the storm, and about Gert behind
it. I don't know if it's because of improved technology, but I was
surprised that both Floyd and Gert were spinning winds of more than
150 mph. I cannot recall any time that two storms of that power _
just scant miles per hour short of catastrophic Category 5 _ were
one-two across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   This either can be traced to global warming, or to La Nina, or
to hyperbole from the weather bureau and media or to the likelihood
that hurricanes were that powerful in the past but because of lack
of scientific documentation, forecasters were unable to properly
gauge the windspeed so far out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   It is equally puzzling to me that the supposed 155 mph winds of
Floyd were not registered as striking the Bahamas at that level _
although any level of hurricane-force winds is too much wind.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot we don't know about hurricanes, but one thing we
do know and that is what hurricanes do. I got my equivalency degree
in Hurricane 401 the hard way with Andrew in 1992 and, despite my
rampant cynicism, am not about to belittle anything the weather
folks are telling me.
</P>
<P>
   Also, I'm not letting down my guard. I remain at battle stations
until the last hurricane of this season fizzles. Don't drop in
unannounced; the house is a mess.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Right at home at the First First
Baptist
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was Sunday morning in our nation's capital, and
I was spending it as I have countless Sunday mornings, boy and man,
occupying a pew at the First Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   The first time for me at this, the First Baptist of Washington,
D.C., but I felt right at home.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind if the surroundings appeared a bit high church for a
down-home Southern Baptist:
</P>
<P>
   Ministers in flowing robes ... dueling pulpits, one for
Scripture reading and another for the sermonizing ... the choir set
off to one side of the altar instead of facing the congregation ...
</P>
<P>
   Creeping Methodism was in our midst.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness when we recited the Lord's Prayer it was the
blessed Baptist version, asking for forgiveness of our trespasses
as we forgive those who trespass against us, not our debts as we
forgive our debtors. That's one thing the King James is wrong
about. Even strict interpretation has its limits.
</P>
<P>
   I read in the church bulletin that the preacher of the day,
filling the pulpit in the absence of a full-time pastor, was Dr.
James A. Langley, executive director editor emeritus of the D.C.
Baptist Convention. A title of nobility, editor emeritus is. I
expected the best from his sermon.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, we were in the Book of Micah, Chapter 6, Verse 8,
as Dr. Langley noted, often considered ``the very essence of the
Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and
to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?''
</P>
<P>
   The words may appear so simple, Dr. Langley said, ``but they are
so demanding.''
</P>
<P>
   And while not every Baptist preacher would attempt mixing Mark
Twain with Micah, such is the leeway granted editor emerituses.
Quoting Mr. Clemens:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what I don't understand in the Bible that troubles
me,'' Dr. Langley declared. ``It's what I do understand.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was that the preacher would have us to understand the
enormity of the task prescribed:
</P>
<P>
   ``God does not merely require justice and mercy, but that we
love mercy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This in a nation that discriminates in employment, in housing
for minorities, in pay for women, in capital murder convictions
where the accused is later found to be innocent, in stricter
penalties for certain types of cocaine, in a justice system that
favors the rich and punishes the poor, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Langley, now quoting Thomas Jefferson:
</P>
<P>
   ``I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just.''
</P>
<P>
   And for those of us who would seek to walk with Him:
</P>
<P>
   ``He is holy, we are sinful. ... He is almighty, we are frail.
... He is omniscient, and our knowledge is like unto a few grains
of sand. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``How else can we imagine walking with God,'' Dr. Langley asked,
``except with humility?''
</P>
<P>
   We sang a hymn of invitation, we passed the plate, and
afterwards we came together in the church basement for a potluck
lunch, not so different from different places of worship most
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   It was Sunday morning in our nation's capital _ Sunday morning
in America.

THE `LION KING' PREPARES TO RETIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE COSTANTINOU  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The lion king is giving up his throne.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a half-century, Jack Castor has reigned supreme at
the Lion House at the San Francisco Zoo. On Friday, the era of Jack
the Big Cat Keeper comes to a bittersweet end.
</P>
<P>
   After announcing his retirement 10 other times in the last few
years, Castor, 75, swears this time it's for real.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday at 2 p.m., visitors will have a last chance to witness
Castor's legendary showmanship as he hand-feeds his beloved lions
and tigers. Then, he'll hang up his meat hook, lock the doors of
the Lion House and say goodbye to the zoo after exactly 48 years, 5
months and 11 days of service _ longer than any other civil servant
in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Generations of visitors _ 25 million by his count _ have come
through the Lion House while Castor has been its animal keeper.
</P>
<P>
   They've crowded around the rails as Castor walked his
wheelbarrow dinner cart, lifted the cage doors and fed the hungry
cats. They've ``oohed'' as he stuck his face up to the cage to let
the cats kiss him hello, and held their breath as the wild animals
nibbled horsemeat morsels from his fingertips. They've clapped as
Castor had the lions and tigers do tricks. And they've heard his
tales.
</P>
<P>
   Such tales they were _ and he just happened to have the
snapshots in his shirt pocket to prove them.
</P>
<P>
   Like how he used to take cubs home with him so he could
bottle-feed and hand-raise them. Or how he once jumped into a cage
to save an injured lion. Or the time his favorite lion, Old George,
played tug-of-war with his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a question of who owned the hand, that's all,''
said Castor.
</P>
<P>
   Castor repeated some of these stories Wednesday during a
retirement bash at the zoo. But he wasn't doing all the talking.
</P>
<P>
   It was time to celebrate Castor's years with speeches and gifts.
As Castor sat on a red throne wearing a red crown in honor of his
lion king status, David Anderson, the zoo director, presented him
with his trusty meat hook mounted on a plaque, and with a bronze
statue of a lion. An ode to Castor written by a former animal
keeper was read aloud. So were letters from U.S. Sen.

<P>
   Sen. Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., and Mayor Willie Brown. Board
Supervisor Michael Yaki presented a proclamation pronouncing it
Jack Castor Day in the City and County of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   And scores of zoo employees, old friends and visitors gave hugs
and shared their memories.
</P>
<P>
   Martin ``Big Bison'' Dias, an animal keeper for 25 years,
remembered his own first day on the job in 1967. The zoo sent him
over to help Castor with the feeding.
</P>
<P>
   Castor took one look at him and casually mentioned that Dias
should be careful. The lions had a funny way of saying hello.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're grabbers,'' Castor told him. ``They always grab the
new ones first.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmm . . . something about fresh meat . . .
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Castor can't believe it's over. Over the years, he
had taken care of 300 lions and tigers. He remembered them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a job I wouldn't have missed for the world,'' he
said. ``If I had to do it all over again, I'd probably start
earlier . . . ``I remember every single day. I'll always have those
memories.''

AFFLECK EMERGES IN `FORCES OF NATURE' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `FORCES OF NATURE'
</P>
<P>
   1999, PG-13, DreamWorks, CC, VHS priced for rental, DVD $29.99.
</P>
<P>
   While Ben Affleck shared an Oscar with Matt Damon for writing
``Good Will Hunting,'' he isn't taken too seriously as an actor
yet. Making ``Armageddon'' and ``Phantoms'' didn't helped.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Affleck has shown an impressive range in other pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The little-seen ``Chasing Amy'' showed off his dramatic skills,
as he played a lovestruck young man pursuing a bisexual woman,
while ``Forces of Nature'' offers his self-effacing comic side, as
did his cameo in ``200 Cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Forces,'' Affleck plays Ben Holmes, an unassuming writer of
book-jacket blurbs who's about to fly from New York to his wedding
in Georgia. Plane trouble and circumstances send him riding down
the road with a mercurial young woman.
</P>
<P>
   She's Sarah (Sandra Bullock), an infectiously fun free spirit
who loosens Ben up on the way to their sudden friendship, which
then veers recklessly toward romance.
</P>
<P>
   They're tossed together in comic misadventures that include
fires, a robbery, missed trains and wild weather _ not to mention
their own ``forces of nature.'' Meanwhile, sympathetic fiancee
Maura Tierney waits and wails amid a sea of guests.
</P>
<P>
   Like her, we wonder if Ben will ever say ``I do'' _ and if so,
to whom?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is fitting and satisfying, but it's the journey that
makes this movie worth watching. 3 1/2 stars.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`THE PRINCE OF EGYPT' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1998, PG, DreamWorks, CC, VHS $26.99, DVD $34.99
</P>
<P>
   Making animated movies on Disney's level used to be an elusive
goal. But this intelligent, handsome film attains such artistry in
bringing ancient Bible tales to vibrant new life.
</P>
<P>
   Its source is the book of Exodus, which tells the story of Moses
from childhood through his missions in God's service.
</P>
<P>
   The movie isn't preachy, although its musical numbers have
meaning and majesty, unlike Disney's formulaic Broadway-style
songs. ``Prince'' succeeds as thoughtful, adventurous, adult-level
entertainment that also embraces a child's sense of wonder.
</P>
<P>
   It's also gratifying to see a feature-length animated film with
no animals or other creatures as comic sidekicks. 3 1/2 stars.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`SUBMARINE' EXTRAS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Yellow Submarine'' is packed with extras on DVD (from MGM,
$29.98), including interviews with creative types and an audio
commentary track from animator John Coates and designer Heinz
Edelmann.
</P>
<P>
   Also on DVD is ``The Mod Odyssey,'' a cheeky seven-minute film
about the movie's creation; the original theatrical trailer
(running more than three minutes _ long by today's standards);
dozens of behind-the-scenes photos, including shots of the Beatles;
and three storyboard sequences.
</P>
<P>
   Also, you can play the entire film with a music-only track _ no
dialogue or sound effects, just the Beatles' songs and George
Martin's orchestral work.
</P>
<P>
   On tape, ``Yellow Submarine'' costs $19.98. Both formats have
the previously unreleased animated song ``Hey Bulldog.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;

WHY SOME ROADS ARE CALLED BLUE STAR HIGHWAYS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I saw on a map that the North-South Freeway (Interstate 35-W)
is called the Blue Star Memorial Highway. Where did this name come
from, and why did it go away?
</P>
<P>
   _ J.T., Fort Worth, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: There are Blue Star Memorial Highways all over the country
named by garden clubs to honor people who served in the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, the National Council of State Garden Clubs
began a program to designate Blue Star highways and place roadside
historical markers. One can be found on I-35 at a roadside park
north of Gainesville, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name was taken from the small service flag that family
members placed in their windows during World War II,'' according to
the New York State Thruway Authority. ``A blue star signified a
family member serving overseas; a red star represented someone who
was injured, and a gold star meant a family member had died in
action.''
</P>
<P>
   To renew interest in the project, some clubs have begun efforts
to find and rededicate their state's Blue Star historical markers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I purchase Dr. Scholl's sandals?
</P>
<P>
   _ K.W., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: One Fort Worth-Dallas retailer recommended by the
manufacturer is Cooper's Shoe Store at 3857 S.W. Loop 820 in Fort
Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper's doesn't presently have the sandals in stock but can
special order them. Call (817) 292-0305 for more information.
</P>
<P>
   To buy them over the phone or find other places that sell Dr.
Scholl's footwear, call the Brown Shoe Co. at (800) 766-6465.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturer has a World Wide Web site at

<P>
   Q: Where can I write to Bill Bradley and Al Gore?
</P>

ALFREDO GIL, MEMBER OF POPULAR LATIN TRIO, 84 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Alfredo Bojalil Gil, whose mellifluous guitar
added honey to the sweet sound of the Latin trio Los Panchos, died
last week at his Mexico City home. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Gil, who was known by his nickname, El Guero, which means
fair-haired in Mexican Spanish, was the last surviving member of
the singing group.
</P>
<P>
   He was born on Jan. 5, 1915, into a musical family in a musical
land, the Gulf state of Veracruz. But to find recognition he had to
travel to New York and its Latin nightclubs. On May 14, 1944, the
trio made its debut with Gil on guitar and another Mexican, Jesus
Navarro, known as Chucho, singing harmonies. The heart-melting lead
voice belonged a tenor from Puerto Rico, Hernando Aviles.
</P>
<P>
   Gil said they agreed to call the group Trio Los Panchos after
the Mexican revolutionary, Pancho Villa, who they assumed would be
well-known outside of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Crooning songs like ``Sin Ti,'' which means ``Without You,''
``Sin un Amor'' (``Without a Love'') and ``Quizas, Quizas, Quizas''
(``Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps''), the trio made the sound of the
bolero familiar to romantics worldwide. Gil composed many of the
songs the group performed.
</P>
<P>
   To lighten and smooth the group's sound, Gil chose to play a
small guitar with a pleasing hum, a requinto. The instrument he
pioneered became essential for romantic troubadour trios.
</P>
<P>
   Los Panchos made more than 300 records, including a number of
songs with the American singer Eydie Gorme, and appeared in some 50
Mexican films. Their recordings have continued to sell tens of
thousands of copies each year. While the lead singer frequently
changed, Gil remained with the group until he retired in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Gil is survived by his wife, Maria Guadalupe Bedoy de Bojalil,
and five children.

HAVE A RICE DAY: INNOVATIVE DISHES SHOW SPLENDOR OF VERSATILE
GRAIN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Ill.) 
(Eds.: See recipes) 
 
By ANN CRISWELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spice it, sauce it, roll it, wrap it up. Rice isn't just for
steaming anymore. Forget plain long-grain, short-grain, parboiled
and instant. Discover arborio, jasmine, basmati, brown,
black/purple Indonesian and Thai rice, red, sushi and sweet rice.
</P>
<P>
   Winners of a recent contest pulled out all the stops in creating
new recipes for the world's favorite starch.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Vanni of Libertyville, Ill., added orange marmalade,
toasted almonds and green onions to win the grand prize in Mr.
Food's Rice Recipe Contest. She won $5,000 and a subscription of
Mr. Food's EasyCooking magazine with her entry, Chicken and Rice
l'Orange.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh fruit, especially tropicals such as mangoes, pineapple and
coconut, were often used in finalists' recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Other contest trends spotted by Kim Park of the USA Rice
Federation, headquartered in Houston:
</P>
<P>
   _ Rice moved to the center of the plate in one-dish meals such
as risotto, stir-frys, salads and paella.
</P>
<P>
   _ Contestants added flavors without adding a lot of ingredients
by using convenience products such as salsa, pesto, jarred sauces
(barbecue, Alfredo, spaghetti, etc.), soup mixes, rice mixes,
pudding mixes, seasoning packets, canned beans, frozen mixed
vegetables and mesquite-grilled chicken.
</P>
<P>
   _ International flavors abound. Ethnic flavors included
Mediterranean, Italian, Mexican, Spanish, Indian, Thai, Caribbean,
Japanese and Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   _ Comfort foods are classic: There were numerous versions of
Broccoli Rice Casserole, Green Chilies and Cheese Rice Casserole,
Chicken and Rice Soup, and Rice Pudding.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rice salads were the third most popular entries after main
dishes and side dishes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most popular main-dish partners with rice were boneless
chicken breasts, ground beef, turkey, sausage, shrimp, crab meat,
salmon and tuna.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vegetarian entrees also were represented _ especially with
beans, beans, beans!
</P>
<P>
   _ Wraps were big _ rice was wrapped in tortillas, puff pastry or
crescent rolls or spooned into pastry shells and pie crusts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Several entries were variations of rice pancakes _ and not
just for breakfast. Savory rice pancakes also were served as
appetizers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rice showed up in a variety of appetizers _ nachos, dips,
quesadillas, crab cakes and rice ``poppers.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Fresh herbs were widely used _ especially cilantro and basil.
</P>
<P>
   _ Other popular ingredients: coconut milk, dried cranberries,
artichokes, black beans, salsa, roasted red peppers and yogurt.
</P>
<P>
   _ Teas were used as flavorings _ especially mango, spearmint and
jasmine tea.

</P>
<P>
   Consumers seem to know a lot more about rice than they used to,
and they're incorporating new types, flavors and mixes into daily
menus, Park said. Consumers like the cooking aroma of varieties
such as jasmine, Louisiana Popcorn Rice, Wild Pecan, Della and
Delta Rose.
</P>
<P>
   There are no hard and fast rules on the type of rice to use for
different cooking tasks, but some general suggestions include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Choose medium- or short-grain rice for creamy dishes, such as
risotto, and for desserts or dishes for which stickier rice is
preferred, such as sushi, molds or croquettes. Choose long-grain
rice when you prefer separate, distinct grains such as in pilaf.
</P>
<P>
   _ American rice does not need washing or rinsing before or after
cooking. In fact, washing removes valuable nutrients. Many recipes
using imported rice advise washing or soaking the rice before
cooking. If in doubt, follow package directions.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you cook a lot of rice, you may want to buy an electric
rice cooker. The microwave also produces excellent rice. It doesn't
take less time than conventional methods, but the rice has a good
texture.
</P>
<P>
   _ To produce perfect rice, measure rice and liquid, and time
cooking accurately. Keep the lid on while rice is cooking so steam
doesn't escape. Use the right size pot; most rice triples in volume
when it cooks.
</P>
<P>
   _ At the end of cooking time, carefully remove lid to avoid
steam. Test for doneness. If rice isn't quite tender or if liquid
remains, cook 2 to 4 minutes longer.
</P>
<P>
   _ If cooked rice is crunchy, add additional liquid, cover again
tightly and cook until tender.
</P>
<P>
   _ When done, remove lid and fluff with a fork to allow steam to
escape and to keep grains separate.

JAILERS DENOUNCE CIVIL RIGHTS CLASSES FOR INMATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY DELGADO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The classes were intended to teach jail inmates
their civil rights, but in the eyes of their jailers, they went too
far, turning into a crash course that taught the students how to
conceal their crimes and thwart police investigations.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco sheriff's deputies, who run the city's jails, were
fuming over the four classes taught Monday and Tuesday at three San
Francisco jails, saying they not only instructed prisoners how to
avoid being caught but included role-playing skits that depicted
cops as racist, violent, incompetent doughnut munchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This teaches criminals how to use the criminal justice system
to their advantage and what the loopholes are,'' said David Hardy,
president of the San Francisco Deputy Sheriffs' Association. ``The
regular citizen on the street isn't going to know what to do when
they get a search warrant, but these guys have learned how to
handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy also criticized the way the classes depicted cops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no problem with people knowing their rights, but
(police officers) were portrayed as racist and incompetent,'' he
said Wednesday. ``The mood of that course bred a lot of contempt
for police officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to complaints from several deputies, department
officials acknowledged the classes were inappropriate and said the
instructor would not be invited back.
</P>
<P>
   The 2 1/2-hour classes were taught by criminal defense and civil
rights attorney Katya Komisaruk to about 120 male and female
prisoners awaiting trial for a variety of misdemeanor and felony
offenses. None of them posed maximum security concerns, jail
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a ``criminal defense guidelines'' sheet handed out
in the class, Komisaruk, who was invited into the jails by the
Sheriff's Department's Prisoner Legal Services division, taught
inmates how to avoid talking to police without an attorney or being
manipulated by a seemingly sympathetic police officer.
</P>
<P>
   The course also showed them how they could prevent police with
search warrants from entering their homes. In at least one class,
Komisaruk advised inmates to avoid stealing from larger department
stores because they have better security, according to deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy said that the courses also included good-cop-bad-cop skits
during which two actors portraying police officers used racial
epithets and were excessively violent when acting out scenarios
using inmate volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials asked Sheriff Michael Hennessey to halt the
classes Tuesday morning after fielding complaints from deputies
after the first two classes on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Eileen Hirst said officials
acknowledged the complaints and asked Komisaruk to quit using some
of the props in her skits and to avoid depicting law enforcement
officers in ways that would provoke ridicule. But Hirst said the
department's head of prisoner legal services had sat in on one of
the classes after that and found it still to be inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear this entire (group of classes) was found offensive
by many people, not just deputies,'' Hirst said, adding that
Komisaruk would not be asked back to teach the classes again.
</P>
<P>
   Hirst said state law required the Sheriff's Department to
provide legal materials and information to inmates. The ``know your
rights'' courses, such as Komisaruk's, have been used to address
the requirements for more than 25 years. The classes have been
taught by outside experts, including defense attorneys, public
defenders and legal scholars and were typically conducted in a
question-and-answer format, Hirst said.
</P>
<P>
   Komisaruk was brought in to teach the four classes after a
former inmate donated $250 specifically for civil rights
instruction. Hirst said a course curriculum that was submitted to
officials for review prior to the classes did not contain anything
offensive or objectionable, and the classes were approved.
</P>
<P>
   Komisaruk said she was surprised by the controversy, especially
since she had taught the very same class several years ago for the
department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the problem is,'' she said. ``It's a little
frustrating. It was going really well, and the prisoners seemed to
like it.'' Komisaruk, a former anti-nuclear activist, served two
years in federal prison after being convicted of destroying
government property, and while in prison applied to Harvard's law
school and was accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Komisaruk acknowledged coaching class participants on what to
say to avoid self-incrimination when confronted by police but said
she firmly believed that her students should be fully apprised of
their legal and civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I usually say is there are lots of ways to handle a
situation,'' Komisaruk said. ``I try to be balanced. I'm always
trying to get in the how-to-do-good messages.''

 &HT;    Atlanta organizers' Olympic report to Congress criticizes IOC
 &HT;    (Eds: Moving in Sports, National categories)
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Olympic officials confirmed in a new report
delivered Wednesday to Congress a pattern of excessive gift giving
and offers of scholarships and job assistance, athletic training
and free healthcare for IOC members and their families.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, former Attorney General Griffin Bell told
lawmakers that the environment in which Atlanta bid for the Games
``encouraged a practice of lobbying IOC members in which excess was
inherent.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell blamed the IOC's bid selection process, not the Atlanta
team's ``boosterism,'' for the excesses in the bid effort. While
the IOC had rules to limit gift-giving and travel, Bell
acknowledged, they were ``often ignored, never enforced and all the
participants knew it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite simply, the competiton for the right to host these Games
was in large part about out-lobbying the competition,'' Bell wrote
in his revision of an earlier report to the U.S. House Commerce
Committee, which is investigating the Atlanta lobbying campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The competition took place in a ``system known to welcome
generous gifts and travel allowances, lavish hospitality, and
personal accommodations.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell said Atlanta's bidding improprieties were not as excessive
as Salt Lake City's, but conceded that the bid team provided many
more unreported gifts that cost more than the $200 limit, including
a $400 shotgun for a National Olympic Committee member, a $222
Chanel scarf for the wife of the Swaziland delegate and a $264
camera for the delegate from Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, who prepared the report for the King &AMP; Spalding law firm
that represented the Atlanta Olympic committee, also acknowledged
numerous shopping sprees conducted by volunteer hostesses in which
many gifts were purchased for members and their wives at upscale
stores. One such spree netted $1,493 in clothing, cosmetics and
toiletries for the IOC member from Russia and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said the bid records revealed 10 instances where the bid
team gave cash, checks or wire payments to IOC members. While there
was no documentation indicating what these payments were for, Bell
said he believed they were reimbursement for first-class plane
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Confirming that the bid team compiled profiles that indicated
certain IOC members could be wooed by ``extending sexual favors,''
Bell said he found no evidence the team paid for or provided sexual
favors.
</P>
<P>
   Bell delivered the report Wednesday to Rep. Thomas Bliley,
(R-Va.), chairman of the Commerce Committee, and Rep. Fred Upton,
(R-Mich.), chairman of the subcommittee on oversight and
investigations, which is spearheading the inquiry into the Atlanta
bid.
</P>
<P>
   After reading the report, Upton said today, ``What has emerged
is a pattern of troubling and disturbing events in order to secure
these games.''
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation was planning
a news conference this afternoon to discuss the report. Atlanta
Olympic chief Billy Payne said in his earlier June 1 report to
Congress that he believed the account proved the city won the Games
without resorting to the kinds of cash payments and extravagant
gifts that sparked the Salt Lake City bribery scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In that report, Payne provided a list of 38 gifts that exceeded
the IOC's $200 limit. The collection of gifts totaled $15,165 and
included glass and crystal sculptures, clothing, a jewelry box, a
ruby pin, luggage and a set of surgical instruments. The foundation
spent an additional $190,482 on less-expensive gifts, such as
T-shirts,
</P>
<P>
   ties and totebags, for all IOC members, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's revised report indicates that many more gifts exceeding
the limit were given.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation also acknowledged donating $25,000 to a South
African anti-apartheid organization and $19,294 worth of soccer
balls and sports equipment to the National School and University
Games in the Republic of Congo. The new report indicates that 1,500
pairs of athletic shoes also went to the Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation also paid $6,805 in tuition and living expenses
for a young swimmer from Mauritius who trained at the Dynamo Swim
Club in Chamblee, and $14,099 for two teens from the Republic of
Congo to attend the prestigious Nick Bolletierri tennis camp in
Bradenton, Fla., in 1990 at the request of expelled IOC member
Jean-Claude Ganga.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, former Mayor Andrew Young, co-chairman of the bid
group, defended the athletic scholarships, saying: ``We are
sports-loving people that see sports as important in world
development. It is an opportunity to assist in the development of
Olympic talent. If we could have gotten half a dozen kids with
Olympic potential, we would have found the money for them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We sincerely hope that our report will demonstrate that
Atlanta won the 1996 Olympic Games fairly,'' said Payne, who
created the foundation in 1987 to bid for the Games and remains its
co-chairman. ``Although we occasionally exceeded the IOC's
guidelines, our work was always done with honest intent.''
</P>
<P>
   However, lawmakers were troubled enough by revelations in the
initial report they sent federal investigators to Atlanta to review
the documents themselves. ``I think that this preliminary response
to our inquiry raises a number of issues that need to be fully
investigated,'' Bliley said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to ensure that the years of hard work and training
athletes spent in pursuit of the Olympic dream won't be tarnished
by any ethical lapses in the site bidding process.''
</P>
<P>
   After investigators found numerous discrepancies between the
report and materials in the boxes, they sought an explanation from
Payne's lawyers at King &AMP; Spalding.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Bell stepped in and acknowledged the original report
was incomplete and inaccurate. He asked lawmakers to be given time
to amend the report.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional investigators estimated the bid group
under-reported its expenditures on gifts for IOC members by
$92,000, and left off about 50 trips for members and their families
from the original report, according to congressional staff.

COSTNER'S ODE TO BASEBALL OVERLY LONG, TEARY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2 STARS  
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Can Tom Hanks please give Kevin Costner a good
talking to?
</P>
<P>
   Not about career management, although it would be nice to see
Costner try to support his shaky superstar status by aiming high
for a change. But that's probably a lost cause; more urgently,
someone really needs to tell this guy that there's no crying in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Love of the Game'' is a women's baseball weepie as surely
as ``Field of Dreams'' was a three-hankie hitter for men. When it's
not superficially but ever-so-solemnly raking over every sports
hero cliche in the record book, it's superficially but
ever-so-sensitively examining a romance that, frankly, isn't
interesting enough to warrant examination.
</P>
<P>
   Or, at least, not extended examination. Like most of Costner's
delusionally dramatic efforts, this movie lasts much longer than
the story it has to tell can support. Costner has been complaining
vigorously that Universal Pictures cut even more, supposedly adult
and character-deepening footage. Maybe, but considering the
pointless elephantiasis the actor's indulged in the likes of
``Wyatt Earp'' and ``The Postman'' recently, it's a safe bet that
the Universal suits were just trying to spare the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from a novel by Michael Shaara, the film charts a really
eventful couple of days in the life of Detroit Tigers pitcher Billy
Chapel (Costner). They're centered around a late season game in New
York, when the team's just been sold and its aging, dependable
workhorse has to consider moving on while pitching what's shaping
up to be a perfect game.
</P>
<P>
   As if that's not enough for a dedicated, talented, all-around
great guy to deal with out there on that Yankee Stadium mound,
Billy's girlfriend has just called it quits. One of those single
moms who can afford a roomy Manhattan apartment on a free-lance
magazine writer's income, Jane Aubrey (Kelly Preston) is heading
off to a real job in London because, she's told Billy, ``You, the
ball and the diamond; you're perfect together.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps wondering where such rotten dialogue came from, Billy
thinks back over his five-year relationship with Jane as the
innings tick by, although there's really not much to chew over.
From the start, he seemed gentlemanly and committed to her in a
way, we presume, he never felt toward any other woman in 35 years.
Not that we'd know, however; in a movie that's at least half
flashbacks, all we ever really learn about Billy personally is that
he loved baseball.
</P>
<P>
   And, darn it, that's the problem. This guy whose whole
livelihood and identity is wrapped up in his job, though patient
and generous and affectionate and funny, just may care a little
more for the game than he can for another person, and Jane can't
abide it. It's supposed to be the movie's big romantic conundrum,
but you keep wondering why these two can't settle this glitch in
what is obviously the best relationship of both their lives with a
genuine adult conversation or two.
</P>
<P>
   Probably because they only have genuinely adult conversations in
Costner movies that Ron Shelton writes. Indeed, as the unmotivated
romantic complications and rote, beat-the-odds athletic hurdles
wear on into the cinematic equivalent of extra innings, your mind
can't stop wandering to the actor's smart sportsman portrayals in
``Bull Durham'' and ``Tin Cup.'' And even though those films were
unapologetic comedies, they somehow put across the actual playing
more persuasively than ``Love'' does.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that Sam Raimi doesn't try. The director,
known for his hyperkinetic ``Evil Dead'' and ``Darkman'' movies,
has a great way with a fastball. But as with his previous, much
more successful feature ``A Simple Plan,'' he opts for a greatly
restrained cinematic style here. It was great for focusing
attention on the earlier film's carefully conceived and developed
characters, but since there's no one remotely like that in this
movie, you just feel gypped out of what could've been a rare chance
to watch baseball move really fast.
</P>
<P>
   As compensation, you get to see Kevin Costner cry. Maybe if he'd
managed his career like Tom Hanks, this could have been avoided. &QL;

VONNEGUT GOES TO THE MOVIES
</HEADLINE>
 For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
OUR RATING: 2 STARS  
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hang around any creative-writing course, and
you're bound to run into somebody trying to be another Kurt
Vonnegut _ thinking brevity and flip irony are a substitute for
style and substance. It isn't that easy.
</P>
<P>
   Capturing Vonnegut on screen can't be easy, either. Whatever you
think of him as a novelist, Vonnegut clearly has his own
distinctive, quirky form. His stories are rarely traditionally
linear, relying instead on delicate rhythms and recurring,
interconnected themes for their structure.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes you wonder why anyone would try to adapt Vonnegut's
``Breakfast of Champions'' some 25 years after the dark, comic
novel was published. Much of the material of the novel _ the
dysfunctional family, the insidious influence of advertising and
the media on our psyche _ has been covered to death since, with
varying degrees of success.
</P>
<P>
   But if anybody could try to translate Vonnegut's crazy-quilt
vision to the screen, it would be Alan Rudolph, who has made such
interesting and intelligent films as ``Welcome to L.A.'' ``Trouble
in Mind,'' ``The Moderns'' and ``Afterglow.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Vonnegut, Rudolph, who wrote and directed the film,
possesses a quirky sensibility, but unfortunately he never quite
makes ``Breakfast of Champions'' his own _ and it shows. So what we
get instead is a mismatched collection of scenes that never connect
but occasionally wake you up with a bizarre moment or an
interesting acting turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breakfast of Champions'' is the story of Dwayne Hoover (Bruce
Willis), the owner of a wildly successful auto dealership in
Midland City. Hoover is having an identity crisis, his image is
everywhere _ TV commercials, billboards, cutout posters _ and
people throughout the town seem to love and trust him. But Dwayne
has no idea who he is or what his purpose in life is. And
everything else in his life seems to be falling apart. His wife,
Celia (Barbara Hershey), is blitzed out on pills and television,
while his son (Lukas Haas) insists on being called Bunny and is
pursuing a career as a lounge singer _ complete with a glittery
ensemble and cute rabbit slippers. His mistress and secretary,
Francine, keeps talking to him like he's a bad boy and is angling
for Dwayne to give her a fast-food franchise. Plus, the
Environmental Protection Agency is investigating toxic wastes
seeping up from the ground in a housing development Dwayne owns.
</P>
<P>
   Hoover's second-in-command at the car dealership, Harry Le Sabre
(Nick Nolte), is having his own crisis _ he's afraid that Dwayne
will find out he enjoys crossing-dressing, and his girlfriend
(Vicki Lewis) is urging him to let it all hang out. Add to this the
fact that a recently released inmate, named Wayne Hoober (Omar
Epps), sees Dwayne as his salvation because their names are so
similar and has camped out in the parking lot of the auto
dealership.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the town's wealthiest man, Eliot Rosewater (Ken
Campbell), has invited the man he considers the world's greatest
novelist, Kilgore Trout (Albert Finney), to speak at the local art
fair, and the town is giving him the red-carpet treatment. Never
mind the fact that the obscure, aging Trout has only been published
in low-rent porn magazines, which Rosewater reads, and that the
sci-fi writer is considered a crackpot.
</P>
<P>
   Got it?
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't, you're not alone. The filmmakers had trouble
putting this together, too. By the end, you have no idea where
Rudolph was going with any of this. And throwing in cheesy
'60s-looking effects that resemble those antacid ads that show the
inner workings of the stomach only adds to the bizarreness quotient
while making the material seem dated.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it isn't every day you Nick Nolte running around in
red stockings, high heels and a garter-belt. But then, is that
something you want to see?
</P>
<P>
   Give Nolte, Finney, Headly and Epps credit for throwing
themselves into the roles and occasionally making this mishmash
palatable, though. Just not digestible. &QL;

 ROXANN DAWSON RIDES `THE BARGE OF THE DEAD' 
</HEADLINE>
  (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to Inside Trek, a
weekly science-fiction column with color and black-and-white art.)
 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Roxann
Dawson in ``Star Trek: Voyager.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Six years.
 &HT;    Roxann Dawson has been playing ``Star Trek: Voyager's'' B'Elanna
Torres for six years. That fact struck the actress hard her first
day back on the set a few months ago.
 &HT;    ``It actually hits me every time I have to sit down and have the
makeup put on,'' Dawson says. ``The show always feels new. It
always feels real to me. Every story is unique. The cast feels like
a family.
 &HT;    ``And the makeup, which still takes two-and-a-half hours to get
on and nearly an hour to get off, is a big pain in the butt,'' she
adds. ``The makeup is really the only thing that makes me think
I've been doing `Voyager' for six years.''
 &HT;    If it weren't for the combination of makeup and prosthetic
appliances that so convincingly transforms her into everyone's
favorite half-human/half-Klingon, however, Dawson wouldn't get to
sink her teeth into such juicy episodes as ``Barge of the Dead.''
Airing on Oct. 6, ``Barge'' sends Torres on a treacherous trek
through Klingon hell after a near-death experience.
 &HT;    On the way to that hell aboard an ancient barge carrying
dishonored souls, Torres encounters her heretofore-unseen mother,
Miral (Karen Austin). That kicks off Torres' frenzied crusade to
save two souls, hers and her mother's.
 &HT;    ``The sets were phenomenal, the story is great and, as far as
being an actress is concerned, it's very exciting to get an episode
that is not only physically demanding but emotionally demanding,''
Dawson says by telephone from her trailer during a production
break. ```Barge of the Dead' is very true to form for B'Elanna, in
that I didn't have to stretch a lot to compensate for things that
didn't make sense.
 &HT;    ``I think it could be the best B'Elanna episode we've gotten to
do so far,'' she says. ``I haven't seen it put together in its
final form yet, but it felt very risky and daring while we were
shooting it, and I think it reveals a lot more than we've ever seen
of the character.
 &HT;    ``It's a very personal story and, at the end, without giving it
away, I think B'Elanna is a different person.''
 &HT;    At least as exciting for Dawson is ``Riddles,'' the ``Voyager''
episode airing on Nov. 3. The hour may focus on Neelix (Ethan
Phillips) and Tuvok (Tim Russ), but Dawson's presence can be felt
from beginning to end, as the actress makes her maiden voyage as a
television director with ``Riddles.''
 &HT;    ``I've been on a million sets with many directors for countless
years, not only on `Voyager' but on other shows as well,'' says
Dawson, who previously had directed for the stage. ``I soaked all
of that in. Also, I really did my homework and prepared for the
job.
 &HT;    ``There weren't a lot of things that were surprises,'' she adds,
``because I didn't expect the shoot to go smoothly. I expected
problems, so when they arose they did not throw me as much as they
would have otherwise. I keep saying this, but I really think my
preparation made me able to handle the various situations that
arose and still be able to enjoy the process.
 &HT;    ``It was such a great time for me,'' the actress says. ``In
terms of really enjoying it, it went way beyond my expectations.''
 &HT;    Right now the episode is in limbo, awaiting the attention of
executive producer Rick Berman, who will give it a final edit.
 &HT;    ``I handed in my version and I thought it looked really
wonderful,'' Dawson says. ``I was very, very proud of it.
 &HT;    ``The show was about nine minutes too long, so quite a bit needs
to be cut,'' she adds. ``I'm not quite sure what the final version
will look like, because it now goes to Rick Berman, but I am very
pleased with it at this point.''
 &HT;    Dawson hopes to direct again in the near future, but she'd
rather scarf down a plate of that slimy Klingon delicacy gagh than
request another episode too soon. She's still recovering from her
first outing, not to mention putting the finishing touches on two
sci-fi novels which she's co-written, due in May from Pocket Books.
 &HT;    ``I'm barely done with `Riddles,''' says ``Voyager's'' latest
hyphenate. ``It would sort of be like having the candy still in
your mouth and asking for more.
 &HT;    ``I think I need to give the producers time to determine whether
or not I succeeded with my first show.''

MARTIN LAWRENCE COMEDY EASY TO ENJOY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
BY BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A basically bulletproof idea _ an ex-con
masquerades as a cop, then proves a better detective than any
veteran on the force _ gets efficient but uninspired rendering in
``Blue Streak.'' It's a knockoff of ``48 HRS.'' knockoffs, and
you've got to like Martin Lawrence to get anything out of it.
</P>
<P>
   But if you can accept those conditions, you're in for a breezy
good time that requires absolutely no work to enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence plays Miles Logan, a high-tech jewel thief with an
unusually winning personality for someone in his line of work. When
the heist of a big diamond from a downtown L.A. vault goes awry, he
hides it in a construction site before the cops close in. Upon his
parole, Miles heads back to the finished building _ which, to his
horror, is now a fully staffed police precinct headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   With daring born of desperation, Miles gets fake papers and
walks into the cop shop as a transfer detective from far out east.
All he wants is to get into the ventilation shaft where his
treasure waits and get out, but circumstances keep calling him to
active duty. Where, to his own and everyone else's surprise, he
shines; hip to the criminal mind-set, Miles can sniff out
everything from insurance fraud to a hinky drug deal in record
time.
</P>
<P>
   Further complications are sent his way in the form of former
colleagues Tulley (Dave Chappelle), a loose-lipped loose cannon of
the Chris Tucker school whom Miles has to bust, and the ruthless
Deacon (Peter Greene), who tried to hijack the original diamond
heist and is still capable of anything. Luke Wilson does Judge
Reinhold duty as Miles' green, admiring but somewhat alarmed
detective partner.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, this is by-the-book action comedy of a rigidly
formulaic sort. But Lawrence rightly viewed it as a showcase for
his over-the-top talents. He wears funny disguises, does wacky
impromptu dances, gets in brutally slapstick fights and has to play
even the sedate scenes at several simultaneous levels of reality.
His big strength has always been his raucous comic energy, and this
film gives him more opportunity to capitalize on it than any he's
made before.
</P>
<P>
   But even though it has a lot of big moments, it's not a
uniformly broad performance. Lawrence has some good, quiet bonding
exchanges with Wilson and an impressive way of still being funny
while Chappelle's doing really crazy stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The director is Les Mayfield, whose dire but improving feature
filmography runs from ``Encino Man'' through the ``Miracle on 34th
Street'' remake to the screechy but inventive ``Flubber.'' ``Blue
Streak'' is far and away his slickest work; it zips along at an
effortless trot while sustaining an easy-to-take attitude.
</P>
<P>
   It's utterly forgettable fun. But unlike many movies with
similarly modest aspirations, at least it's fun. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
The film: &LR; !off! ``Blue Streak'' (PG-13; violence, language). &UR;  &QL; 
The stars: &LR;  Martin Lawrence, Luke Wilson, Dave Chappelle, Peter
Greene. &UR;  &QL; 
Behind the scenes: &LR;  Directed by Les Mayfield. Written by Michael
Berry, John Blumenthal and Steve Carpenter. Produced by Toby Jaffe
and Neal H. Moritz. Released by Columbia Pictures. &UR;  &QL; 
Running time: &LR;  One hour, 33 minutes. &UR;  &QL; 
Our rating: &LR;  3 stars &QL;

`SUGAR TOWN' NAILS UNDERGROUND ROCK CULTURE, LITTLE ELSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
OUR RATING: 2 STARS  
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
 LOS ANGELES _ Watching the often engaging but maddeningly uneven
``Sugar Town,'' it's obvious that its filmmakers know a thing or
two about the Los Angeles music scene. And indeed Allison Anders,
who co-wrote and co-directed the movie with Kurt Voss, has made
something of a mark making music-themed films, first (with Voss)
``Border Radio,'' a chronicle of the dark side of the L.A. punk
underground, and, later, ``Grace of My Heart,'' a movie
distinguished more by its songs than its substance.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Sugar Town'' is filled with dead-on characterizations and wry
observations, but, in the end, it doesn't amount to much. Anders
and Voss, both of whom attended UCLA's film school, wrote the movie
in eight days and screened the premiere a mere six months after
starting the script.
</P>
<P>
   And while that immediacy may have been liberating for them, the
screenplay could have used a few revisions. For all its knowing
insights into has-beens and wanna-bes, ``Sugar Town'' lacks solid
dramatic arcs, not to mention a purpose. It's about as relevant as
a bubble-gum pop song.
</P>
<P>
   Loosely episodic, ``Sugar Town'' follows the lives of a host of
characters pursuing fame. Some have been to the top and want to
return; others want that first taste and are willing to do anything
to get it. For a movie with a large ensemble, Anders and Voss do a
credible job of spreading the story lines and keeping the film
moving steadily forward. What's missing, though, is a payoff.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the action is an ad-hoc grouping of '80s rock
musicians, played, appropriately enough, by '80s rock musicians _
John Taylor (Duran Duran), Michael Des Barres (he subbed for Robert
Palmer with the supergroup Power Station) and Martin Kemp (Spandau
Ballet). They have a demo, but the record companies aren't biting.
The complaint: They don't hear a single. They're probably right.
</P>
<P>
   While the band's producer, Burt (Larry Klein), shops the record,
the film's women cope with various crises. Former ingenue actress
Eva (Rosanna Arquette) frets about being asked to play Christina
Ricci's mother; Liz (Ally Sheedy) looks for love in all the wrong
places; Gwen (Jade Gordon) pursues rock stardom with duplicitous
zeal. (The character seems loosely based on Courtney Love.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Carl (John Doe from L.A. rock band X) debates whether
he should leave his very pregnant wife (Lucinda Jenney) and a bevy
of children behind in Topanga Canyon to go on tour with a Latina
hottie (Lumi Cavazos).
</P>
<P>
   Carl's brother (Richmond Arquette) returns from rehab with a
thing for his sister-in-law. One of the rockers is presented with a
son (Vincent Berry) he supposedly fathered. (The kid bears a closer
resemblance to Dracula.) He reasons the boy couldn't be his,
offering a hairsplitting sexual excuse that Bill Clinton would
admire.
</P>
<P>
   And, remarkably, the movie offers even more subplots, including
a wealthy widow (Beverly D'Angelo) with a thing for leather-clad
musicians. Often, ``Sugar Town'' seems like a musical soap opera,
an ``As the Rock World Turns.'' The only thing missing is someone
coming down with amnesia.
</P>
<P>
   The boys in the band are thoroughly believable, and the movie
works best when it gives these veterans room to riff off of their
faded personas. Too bad their efforts go largely wasted in a
feature that could have used a little more work while it was being
initially composed. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL;

and sexuality). &UR;  &QL; 
The stars: &LR;  Rosanna Arquette, Beverly D'Angelo, Michael Des Barres,

RITA MORENO: A STAR WHO'S NOT SLOWING DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There are street clothes. And there are gig
clothes. And for entertainers such as Rita Moreno, never the twain
shall (or should) meet. We're talkin' flash here as opposed to
Polartech.
</P>
<P>
   We're discussing soigne fashion instead of functional sweats.
</P>
<P>
   But it's functional sweats that Moreno is wearing when she
answers the door to her new Berkeley, Calif., home with a view. A
one-piece, soft-as-down gray, belted jumpsuit that makes her wiry,
size-six body look even smaller.
</P>
<P>
   ``You sure you're a size six?'' I ask her. But, there's the
matter of what she calls her rounded behind, that quite feminine
rump, pumped up from 45 years of dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno does no dancing (except for possibly her huge kohl-rimmed
eyes) during her current entertainment gig at the Plush Room. Plus,
the Plush Room is not Carnegie Hall. So certain corrections,
regarding couture, had to be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to change my entire wardrobe,'' she says, pulling her
performance clothes out of white garment bags. ``The stuff I have
for concerts is too big for the room. I use much more beads and
baubles. But the white skirt, the one I wore opening night, is all
transparent sequins. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Well, compared with the bugle beads she dons head-to-toe in
symphony halls, it is a symphony of simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno is a tiny, 5-feet-3 sprite with perfect and perfectly
tawny skin, slim arms, silken shoulders and graceful hands. Her
wardrobe begs display from the top of a piano lid, which is where
she's perched (or prone) through many of the 14 numbers in her act.
So the clothes have to work.
</P>
<P>
   Paired with a slinky pave sequined white skirt with a sexy slit
in the back is a leg-o-mutton-sleeved, zip-front jacket in black
taffeta with black velvet appliques outlined in black sequins. It
fits tightly at Moreno's exquisitely wasp waist, and when she
unzipped it opening night during ``Baby, Ain't I Good to You,'' to
reveal a sparkly black camisole, every man in the audience gasped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't sing a sexy song with a jacket on,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The next night, Moreno wore a lavender bias-cut strapless sheath
with self-colored sequins and a matching shrug. When she reclined
on the piano, she stuck the microphone in her bustier.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like the right thing to do at the time. Although she
is a seasoned pro with some original and interesting work to her
credit _ the most recent is playing a nun drug counselor on HBO's
gritty series, ``Oz'' _ she's never done cabaret before and says of
opening night, ``I was scared to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, you'd never know it.
</P>
<P>
   The look she was after for the Plush Room appearance, which is
her warm-up for the Algonquin Hotel gig in New York, was ``elegant,
sexy lady,'' she says. ``There aren't any outfits like that, so I
had to have them made.''
</P>
<P>
   The black fouffy-sleeved jacket was a copy for a Thierry Mugler
suit jacket. She's thinking about having it done in purple, too.
``I love separates,'' she says. ``It's something about looking
extremely glam, an in-your-face chic and casual. If I could do it,
I would roll up my sleeves.''
</P>
<P>
   She also adores collecting costume jewelry, the brighter the
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter always says to me, `Mom, why don't you have the
real stuff,' and I tell her: `I'm a Hispanic woman. I looooooove
costume jewelry.'''
</P>
<P>
   That most of her wardrobe, save the lilac number, is simple
black and white is pure Moreno. Even with her rented furniture
(``We moved in a few months ago and I still don't have my own stuff
up here yet,'' she moaned), Moreno's home, with the incredible
views of downtown Oakland and the East Bay, is all bare floors,
cream-colored couches and Moreno's collection of graphic Navajo
rugs done mostly in tones of black, white, gray and red.
</P>
<P>
   It is the house of an artist, with musical scores, tapes and
lyrics piled neatly on the dining-room table and folklore artifacts
arranged on tabletops.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen is a cook's dream, with acres of granite counters,
panoramic windows that stretch the length of the back side of the
house and a handy conversation area around the center island, which
is equipped with a stainless-steel range and a shelf filled with
jar after jar of baby food for Moreno's grandbaby, her daughter
Fernanda's son, Justin.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno is one of those enduring and endearing performers who
injects her roles, as well as her performances, with kinetic
energy. Fans remember her electric Anita in ``West Side Story,''
for which she won an Oscar; younger fans can sing all her patter
songs from PBS's ``The Electric Company,'' which earned her an Emmy
and a Grammy; and her gay fans will never forget the Latin
spitfire, Googie Gomez, from Broadway's ``The Ritz,'' for which she
won a Tony.
</P>
<P>
   Her contemporaries include Chita Rivera and Shirley MacLaine,
hoofers with great legs (always the last to go, so they say) and
boundless energy. I ask her about the usual stuff. What she eats.
(Not much. It was 2 p.m. and she had to decide between a nap and
food. The nap won.) And her beauty regimen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to be horrified,'' she says. ``I use a Buff Puff
on my face every day of my life. And I've never had what most
people my age have. I don't get those tiny bits of loose skin under
my makeup.''
</P>
<P>
   (She's right, I am horrified . . . but, if it ain't broke, don't
fix it.)
</P>
<P>
   In clothing, as in furniture, Moreno says she loves ``simple
lines. Nothing too frou-frou.''
</P>
<P>
   It's her hair that has the runaway curls. At the age of 67 (she
turns 68 in December), she's finally stopped fighting her naturally
curly coif. ``When it's so damp here with all this fog, I have no
choice,'' she says with a laugh. ``My hair just goes `home.'''
</P>
<P>
   Home now is Berkeley, close to her daughter and away from the
Hollywood boogaloo, and, when she has to go back to film ``Oz,'' a
pied-a-terre in New York to accommodate Moreno and her physician
husband, Lenny Gordon, who has been her lighting director the past
15 years.

THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME FOR SINGER KEVIN MAHOGANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CALVIN WILSON  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Just six years ago, Kevin Mahogany supported
himself by working as a data processor while pursuing a dream: to
be a jazz singer. In nightclubs all over Kansas City he chased that
dream relentlessly, applying his rich baritone to the standard jazz
repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he always sang jazz. Sometimes he lent his talents to
R&AMP;B or pop. But it all helped him to connect with audiences in
places like the Club at Plaza III and come to an understanding of
his gifts as a performer. And even when the dream seemed out of
reach, it was always on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Mahogany, 41, is a star. A big man with charm to match, he
performs in such top-flight New York clubs as Birdland and Iridium,
is a favorite at jazz festivals nationally and internationally, and
has six well-received albums in the racks. In a critics' poll in
Down Beat magazine he was recently named Best Male Jazz Vocalist of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   But Mahogany rarely performs in Kansas City anymore _ even
though he was born here and still lives here. So his concert
tonight at the Uptown Theater should be a don't-miss event.
Patricia Barber, a fine Chicago jazz singer with a solid following
of her own, is also on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Mahogany, who has dabbled in pop music in concert and on
recordings, insists he has no intention of abandoning jazz. And
that goes for Kansas City, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It keeps me humble and it keeps me grounded,'' he said,
dressed in a T-shirt and jeans and relaxing in The Star's cafeteria
on a recent afternoon. The city reminds him of the days when he was
hungry for success, and that's a hunger he never wants to lose.
</P>
<P>
   In concert at the Uptown, it's a good bet that Mahogany will
focus on tunes included on his latest CD, ``My Romance'' (Warner
Bros.). Not only would that be a smart marketing move, but it would
also reflect his affinity for the material.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a project that I've wanted to do for a long time,'' he
said. ``An album of nothing but love songs and ballads. That's what
I get requests for, more than anything, when I'm out performing.
Everybody likes a love song.''
</P>
<P>
   And more than a few people like Mahogany, who, through a
combination of talent and luck, established himself on the national
scene just before vocal jazz shook off its cobwebs and reasserted
its popularity. Indeed, the competition has become fierce in the
last five years, with such nationally recognized stylists as
Cassandra Wilson and Diana Krall not only impressing critics but
also crossing over into the pop market.
</P>
<P>
   To Mahogany, the trend only makes sense once you understand that
both pop fans and jazz fans can appreciate a good tune.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of funny how they're parallel in that way,'' said
the vocalist, who has also written songs including ``Still
Swingin''' and ``Fix It in the Mix.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Both audiences know all the tunes. I try to mix a little fun
in with the seriousness of the music. Because it is entertainment _
which I think a lot of people, especially jazz artists, tend to
forget.'' At the Uptown, Mahogany's honey-smooth voice will be
accompanied by pianist James Weidman, guitarist Greg Skaff, bassist
Tyrone Clark and drummer Todd Strait. The latter two are local
musicians.
</P>
<P>
   The wonderful thing about a Mahogany show is the interaction
between the singer and his combo: the exhilarating blend of fine
musicianship, unexpected turns and self-deprecating good humor. At
New York's Iridium in 1998, Mahogany used ``Fix It in the Mix,'' a
song about mishaps in a recording studio, as the basis for a skit
in which band members took hilariously incongruous solos.
</P>
<P>
   As he bantered with the musicians and joked with the crowd, you
could see what has made Mahogany such a success: His easy way with
people and his willingness to do whatever it takes to make a
performance not just entertaining, but memorable.
</P>
<P>
   Even people who think of jazz singers as musty anachronisms have
been won over by Mahogany's charms. At the heart of his appeal is
the understanding that, when done right, jazz need make no
apologies for its timeless virtues. But he also understands that to
connect with audiences, the music must keep up with the times.
Indeed, he has come a long way since his days as a journeyman
Kansas City performer.
</P>
<P>
   His sound nods to tradition while incorporating contemporary
influences. In a given set, Mahogany may thoughtfully deconstruct a
jazz standard or thoroughly reinvent a pop tune. And he can scat _
that is, let loose a stream of nonsense syllables with rhythmically
infectious exuberance _ like nobody's business.
</P>
<P>
   A performance at the Monterey Jazz Festival in 1995 exemplified
his style. As laidback and informal as he is in his personal life,
onstage he comes across as an emissary from an earlier time: cool,
dapper, elegantly smooth. He harks back to singers like Billy
Eckstine and Joe Williams, who cradled listeners with their voices
and had more than a touch of class.
</P>
<P>
   Illuminated by the lights of the outdoor stadium and clad in a
cream-colored suit, Mahogany charmed the Monterey crowd with a
rendition of ``Since I Fell for You'' that virtually defined
romantic pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life is such misery and pain,'' he sang, stretching each
syllable of mis-er-y as he strolled the stage on a Saturday night.
``I guess I'll never be the same, since I fell for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, in an indoor festival hall, Mahogany entranced
a more intimate crowd with a playful run through the Stevie Wonder
hit ``My Cherie Amour.'' Caught up in his own momentum, he sang
``pretty as the Milky Way'' instead of ``distant as the Milky
Way.'' But it didn't matter: He owned the room regardless.
</P>
<P>
   Then as now, Mahogany exudes an enthusiasm for jazz that makes
the music that much more accessible _ and has made his albums for
the Enja and Warner Bros. labels sought-after gems. But to hear
Mahogany at his charismatic best, you really need to hear him in a
live setting. Regardless of the setting, he communicates. In recent
years he has performed at both the Kansas City Blues &AMP; Jazz
Festival and the Kansas City International Jazz Festival.
</P>
<P>
   At the first International Jazz Festival in 1996, Mahogany
delivered a delightfully varied program that veered from the
infectious ``Little Black Samba'' to the swinging ``Our Love Is
Here to Stay.'' Even for listeners who had enjoyed him for years in
Kansas City clubs, his authority and range were revelatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He swings, and he has a foot in that old, great blues sound of
Kansas City,'' said Steve Irwin, co-producer of the annual event.
``And he's one of a very few singers anymore who can make you cry
with a ballad.''
</P>
<P>
   Vocalist Barber, who has been praised for her edgy, modern sound
and her ability to transform rock tunes like ``Light My Fire'' into
legitimate jazz expression, said she was impressed with Mahogany's
artistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to stay away from vocalists, because I don't want to be
influenced,'' said the singer, whose latest album is ``Modern
Cool'' (Premonition). ``But I've heard him on the radio, and I know
that he can sing. It's going to be quite a challenge to double-bill
with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahogany, who is married to photographer Allene Mahogany, didn't
start out as a singer. When he was 12 he played saxophone in an
18-piece big band, Kansas City's New Breed Orchestra. Unlike many
people who pursue music at an early age but move on, he kept at it.
But not as a saxophonist.
</P>
<P>
   In his senior year at Lincoln High School, Mahogany began
singing. And he kept on singing: in a jazz choir he founded while
studying at Baker University in Baldwin City, Kan.; in Kansas City
rhythm and blues bands; and in his own jazz groups.
</P>
<P>
   Things weren't always easy: Just before his career took off with
the 1993 release of his first album, ``Double Rainbow'' (Enja), he
paid the bills by taking on temp work as a data processor. But
those days are far behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Mahogany's subsequent Enja releases, ``Songs and Moments''
(1994) and ``You Got What It Takes'' (1995), set the stage for his
move to Warner Bros., a major label with the clout to take his
career to the next level. But his first Warner album, ``Kevin
Mahogany'' (1996), had some critics worried that the jazz singer
was compromising his art. The album combined straight-ahead jazz
with more pop-oriented material, including tunes by Fats Domino and
Stevie Wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look back at it,'' Mahogany said, ``it was probably
ill-timed. I was doing the music that I grew up with, but still
with a jazz and blues sensibility about it. But I think what
happened was, because it was the first one at Warner Bros., people
thought I was trying to cross over.''
</P>
<P>
   On his subsequent albums, ``Another Time, Another Place'' (1997)
and last year's ``My Romance,'' Mahogany's approach has been more
traditional but no less adventurous. And he said he plans to
continue taking risks.
</P>
<P>
   After all, that's what jazz is all about.

MCDONALD'S PUSH INTO RUSSIA CHRONICLED IN FRANCHISER'S
AUTOBIOGRAPHY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA MCUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1990, East met West _ over a hamburger.
</P>
<P>
   That was the year the first McDonald's opened in what was then
the Soviet Union _ in Pushkin Square no less.
</P>
<P>
   The event was global in news coverage because of its economic,
political and social significance: a true meeting of once highly
adversarial cultures, with fries and a milkshake on the side.
</P>
<P>
   The odds against that happening, despite changes at that time in
the business climate, were phenomenal, even for the multinational,
multibillion-dollar hamburger giant.
</P>
<P>
   But it happened largely through the 14-year effort of one man,
and it wasn't McDonald's founder Ray Kroc.
</P>
<P>
   Kroc may be synonymous with McDonald's in the United States, but
in Russia, George Cohon is the man behind the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   His amazing feat, along with the rest of Cohon's life, is
chronicled in his autobiography, ``To Russia With Fries: My Journey
From Chicago's South Side to Moscow's Red Square _ Having Fun Along
the Way'' (McClelland &AMP; Stewart, 335 pages, $21.95). Writer David
Macfarlane co-authored the book.
</P>
<P>
   The book's foreword is written by none other than Mikhail
Gorbachev, who sings the praises of this hamburger man.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the height of the period of stagnation, when the free
spirit of the market was totally nonexistent, George
enthusiastically pursued the idea of starting a business here, and
he succeeded, despite having to fight his way through the
bureaucratic jungle,'' Gorbachev writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not just a personal triumph for George. It was a
breakthrough which demonstrated that new economic relations between
our country and the rest of the world were possible. It was a
symbol of the good will of international business which would be
important in helping us build a democratic society.''
</P>
<P>
   This highly readable autobiography shows how Cohon put his small
life savings
into building what has become a $2 billion McDonald's franchise in
Canada and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In a personal twist, Cohon's experience in Russia was actually
like a return home. In 1906, his infant father and grandparents
escaped from their home in the Ukraine during the pogroms, barely
making it onto a crammed boat to America. The family name Kaganov
was changed to Cohon by an immigration officer at Ellis Island, he
writes.
</P>
<P>
   But Cohon immediately asks everyone who meets him to call him
George.
</P>
<P>
   Cohon's personal tone in the book must exemplify the type of
person he is. Time and time again, he tells readers how much he
learns from just talking to people _ anybody, anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always enjoyed these kinds of conversations and chance
encounters,'' he writes. ``I find myself talking with someone _ a
customer, a stranger at a store, a cab driver _ and I start
talking. This is how you learn things, this is how you find out
what other people think.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohon is also full of stories, hundreds of them, which makes for
an engaging autobiography. Not only are the stories interesting and
poignant, but they also jump around in time and space, keeping the
book from being linear, and consequently boring.
</P>
<P>
   His most fascinating tale has to be about his Russian
experience, however, and most of the book involves this trek. It
started with a chance meeting with a Soviet delegation observing
the Montreal Olympics, which got Cohon thinking that McDonald's
could be the food provider for the 1980 Games in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Cohon describes some of the many hurdles that were jumped to
fulfill such a contract, a contract he spent four years trying to
persuade the Soviets to give him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although their agricultural system seemed to be in almost
total disarray, we felt that its individual components were often
sound,'' he writes. ``There were potatoes, but they were rotting in
the fields. There were trucks, but they were stranded on the roads,
out of gas. It wasn't a question of inventing the wheel so much as
ensuring that gears were meshing and the wheel was turning
properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohon ultimately did not get the Olympics contract, but his
efforts did pave the way for opening his first McDonald's there 10
years later.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Cohon describes, that significant step wasn't just a
fast-food restaurant opening. Because there was no independent meat
supplier, bakery or dairy up to the company's standards, all of
them had to be built _ in a massive 100,000-square-foot plant that
made products from meat to ketchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, our McComplex processes fifty-seven tons of food a
day,'' he writes. ``And it doesn't only supply what we need at
McDonald's; at any number of Moscow's finest restaurants and
hotels, as well as foreign embassies, chances are that the food _
the meat for the filet mignon, the cream in the creme caramel _
comes from our plant.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's turned out to be a tremendous example of Western
capitalism at work in the heart of the former communist stronghold.
Cohon's story is fun to read, but his life is significant enough to
wind up in the history books.

   ``Public Speaking for Dummies''
</P>
<P>
   By Malcolm Kushner
</P>
<P>
   IDG Books, $16.99
</P>
<P>
   By now, the ``For Dummies'' series is in the American lexicon,
and it deserves the honor by communicating information on tough
subjects painlessly to its readers with lively writing and snappy
graphics. Now the series tackles the much-feared task of public
speaking. This book is written by a popular Fortune 500 speaker,
who is also an author and attorney. His first section is titled ``A
Crash Course in Influencing People,'' which shows how in tune he is
with his subject. A great book.

   ``The Joy of Work: Dilbert's Guide to Finding Happiness at the
Expense of Your Co-Workers''
</P>
<P>
   By Scott Adams
</P>
<P>
   HarperBusiness, $12.95
</P>
<P>
   This book is mean _ but it's also pretty funny. In addition to
Dilbert cartoonist Scott Adams' ideas on how to tweak your office
life into something fun, he pulls from the thousands of workers who
e-mail him with their own ideas. One such writer tells how he made
a copy of a co-worker's car key and changed the preset radio
stations every day for three months. Funny, but pretty cruel,
especially because the guy went to the car shop four times to try
and get it fixed. If you like this kind of gallows humor, this is
the book for you.

   ``Patton on Leadership: Strategic Lessons for Corporate
Warfare''
</P>
<P>
   By Alan Alexrod
</P>
<P>
   Prentice Hall, $23
</P>
<P>
   I'm not making this up, although with some of these book titles
I wish I were. This book is coming out on Veterans Day, no less, to
tie in with the whole military theme. Instead of much narrative,
this book is largely made up of 183 one-page lessons that could
have been on a daily calendar instead of in a book. It's
interesting to see such a book when most of the management thought
today is based on getting away from hierarchical thinking.

OUR WORDS AGAINST VIOLENCE DO LITTLE WITHOUT GUN CONTROL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB RAY SANDERS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shortly after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, a man who
was then one of America's most despised leaders had microphones
shoved in his face as he was asked to give his reaction to the
death of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm X would utter words that not only repulsed most of the
country at the time, but would cause his own Nation of Islam leader
to ban him to silence for months.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most Americans, Malcolm seemed to show no sign of
remorse, and unlike many politicians of the day, he did not utter
the innocuous overused phrase, ``I'm shocked and saddened.''
</P>
<P>
   The defiant black Muslim activist distinctly proclaimed in 1963:
</P>
<P>
   ``The chickens have come home to roost.''
</P>
<P>
   He was acutely accurate and, in hindsight, profoundly poignant.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Wednesday's tragic shootings in a Fort Worth
church, those words reverberate in the city where Kennedy spent his
last night before heading to Dallas on that fateful November
morning.
</P>
<P>
   No one really understood Malcolm X then, because no one really
tried.
</P>
<P>
   His comments weren't meant to be flippant during one of
America's most painful moments, nor were they intended to be
disrespectful of the slain president.
</P>
<P>
   He was simply saying that in a country where violence is so
prevalent _ sometimes revered _ and in a nation that was so
tolerant of hatred toward those who were different, we should not
be surprised when violence rises up close to home and claims one of
our own who is greatly admired, truly cherished or deeply loved.
</P>
<P>
   As with other cities in recent months, my hometown is in
mourning this day, befuddled by a catastrophe that no one ever
believed could happen here.
</P>
<P>
   On a Wednesday night, when church people all over the state are
in prayer meetings, the unthinkable happens in a house of God, and
we all begin crying, ``Lord, have mercy.''
</P>
<P>
   But in light of so many destructive acts against so many
innocent people, our doubts intrude on our good thoughts, and we
begin to ask, ``Lord, don't you have any mercy left?''
</P>
<P>
   This was not God's doing. It was man's. It was ours.
</P>
<P>
   We should have paid attention to the chickens, for they've been
headed home to the roost for some time.
</P>
<P>
   For years, in our blind and selfish arrogance, we have sent the
wrong messages to adults and teen-agers about violence, and then
feigned shock when our communities were rocked by random,
senseless, man-made calamities.
</P>
<P>
   We live in a state where politicians believe that during
campaigns they have to be seen with guns as big as their smiles,
shooting down some innocent critter.
</P>
<P>
   It's expected. How can you get elected in Texas these days
without proclaiming your love for guns?
</P>
<P>
   Just this year, the Texas Legislature passed a law prohibiting
government agencies, counties and municipalities from suing gun or
ammunition manufacturers. Gov. George W. Bush ceremoniously signed
the bill in May.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years earlier, the state proudly instituted the
right-to-carry law, allowing citizens to carry concealed weapons.
(I'm sure I'll hear after this massacre that if someone in the Fort
Worth church had been ``packing,'' this tragedy could have been
prevented or lessened.)
</P>
<P>
   Although Fort Worth leaders have expressed concern about the
regularly scheduled gun shows held in public buildings, they have
not voted to prevent these blatant displays and the sale of
firearms.
</P>
<P>
   After a dreadful event such as the one in this city Wednesday
night, we'll hear plenty of words denouncing violence.
Unfortunately, our actions continue to speak loudly to the
contrary.
</P>
<P>
   Above all the rhetoric, there will be a loud flapping noise ...
of the chickens coming home to roost.

<P>
   Kentucky-bred singer-songwriter Travis Meeks gave his band the
boot following Days' well-regarded 1997 debut album and now takes
the reins, playing most of the instruments, producing and writing
everything here.
</P>
<P>

strings and brass into the picture, shooting for the grand,
near-concept-album approach of '70s icons like Pink Floyd.
Sometimes, though, the ornate arrangements overcome the material,
which can veer dangerously close to just plain ordinary. But with
tracks like ``Enemy,'' all elements fall into place, suggesting
Meeks has some bright days ahead indeed. 3 stars

   TOWER OF POWER/``WHAT IS HIP?: AN ANTHOLOGY'' (Warner
Archives/Rhino)
</P>
<P>
   You want authentic old-school funk 'n' soul? Here's the place to
start _ a timeless two-disc collection spotlighting Oakland's
integrated r&AMP;b ensemble, which reached its commercial zenith
between 1972-75.
</P>
<P>
   As the package reveals, Tower of Power was all about expert
musicianship, sizzling grooves and a stop-on-a-dime horn section
that moonlighted on countless albums by other acts.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with 1971's ``East Bay Grease,'' the outfit cut more
than 15 albums in 30 years and ``What Is Hip?'' skims the cream.
Whether you're a longtime devotee or a newcomer to this garden of
very earthly delights, you'll get a major kick from such magical
moments as ``Down to the Nightclub,'' ``You Got to Funkifize,''
``Don't Change Horses (In the Middle of a Stream)'' and, of course,
the fabulous title track. Also included is the previously
unreleased ``Credit'' and the rare, non-album single sides ``Stroke
'75'' and ``Simple as That.'' 4 stars

   THE WISEGUYS/``THE ANTIDOTE'' (Ideal/Mammoth)
</P>
<P>
   The Wiseguys are essentially one guy, a lanky Brit named Touche'
(Theo Keating) who blends old-school beats and hip-hop grooves with
witty found sounds, classic soul and funk references into an
engaging gumbo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ooh La La,'' the single that hit No. 2 on the UK charts, is
hard to overlook, but ``Cowboy '78'' boasts an effective ``Fistful
of Dollars'' riff, while ``The Grabbing Hands'' grabs from all
sides. For pure disco anthems, it's hard to top ``Start the
Commotion'' and ``Bounce to the Beat,'' aimed straight at dance
clubs everywhere. 3 stars

</P>
<P>
   The point of this exercise _ in which Prine duets with a passel
of mostly alt.country ladies on chestnuts even the Nashville crowd
probably considers hokey _ escapes. Prine is one of the great
eccentric singer-songwriters of his generation, on a par with Randy
Newman and Steve Earle, but a song stylist he ain't. He repeatedly
hits bum notes while trying to harmonize with Iris DeMent, Dolores
Keane, Melba Montgomery, Lucinda Williams and such on songs that
boast wonderful, old-timey orchestrations but mostly puerile lyrics
by the likes of Roger Miller and Bobby Braddock.
</P>
<P>
   An album of his own compositions, reinterpreted with other
voices, probably would've worked better. 2 stars

   INDIGENOUS/``THINGS WE DO'' (Pachyderm)
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of teen blues guitarists with few chops and even
less feel can have longtime aficionados of the six-stringed art
gnashing teeth. But Mato Nanji, a South Dakota Sioux, plays with
thrilling skill and genuine commitment to the blues.
</P>
<P>
   Nanji's band Indigenous, which includes a sister, brother and
cousin, plays blues-rock with the best of 'em. In fact, when we
heard a song from ``Things We Do,'' the quartet's excellent debut
album, on the radio unannounced the other day, we assumed it was a
lost Eric Clapton track.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of British blues will want to check out such gems as ``Now
That You're Gone,'' ``What's Goin' On'' and the disc's centerpiece,
``Holdin' Out,'' a soaring, Hendrix-tinged instrumental. 3 1/2

   Those who enjoyed French duo Air's intriguing debut, ``Moon
Safari,'' will certainly gravitate toward this prequel, a
seven-track collection of mostly instrumental early singles,
including ``Modular Mix,'' ``Californie'' and ``Les
Professionales.'' While ``Premiers Symptomes'' isn't as instantly
compelling as the album, it's fascinating to follow the development
of Air's moody, noir-styled sound. 3 stars

   WOOD/``SONGS FROM STAMFORD HILL'' (Columbia)

   Once you get past the ridiculous band name, British
singer-songwriter James Maddock has come up with one of the most
satisfying debuts of the year, highlighted by standouts ``I Only
Came for You'' and ``You Said the Words.''
</P>
<P>
   This music, with its beautiful melodies, great lyrics and
imaginative choruses designed for mental dancing, has the power to
recall moods and feelings you can't quite put your finger on.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, however, not everything works so well and a
couple of tracks sail too far into patented Eagles territory.
Incidentally, you may already know opening track ``Stay You,''
featured on the best-selling ``Dawson's Creek'' sampler. 3 stars

   Cornell's old group, Seattle's recently disbanded Soundgarden,
practiced a sonic diversity that led to the more experimental
terrain found here. Owner of a soaring yet vulnerable delivery,
Cornell uses sometimes surreal musical textures and varied singing
styles here as he stretches out over piano and bluesy guitar on the
surprisingly gospel-fueled ``Disappearing One'' and the
r&AMP;b-drenched ``When I'm Down.'' Among the best tracks, the
sorrowful ``Wave Goodbye,'' a sad tribute to the late Jeff Buckley,
and the lush radio fave, ``Can't Change Me.'' 3 stars &QL;

GAYS FIND ACCEPTANCE ON TV IS FOLLOWED BY STEREOTYPING JOKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gay characters were found on a variety of TV shows last season,
barely raising an eyebrow and not generating protests from
notoriously trigger-happy fringe groups.
</P>
<P>
   But as any gay person who watches television can attest, being
accepted is one thing, how you're portrayed is another.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that gays would gripe most about never seeing an
accurate loving relationship _ with kissing and at least the hint
of a regular sex life.
</P>
<P>
   But the new issue may be that gay characters are the buffoon or
mocked openly. After viewing the available fall programs, I can
tell you that your skin better be thick. Countless shows have gay
jokes in them, a concept that was unthinkable just two seasons ago.
Gays now can sit back with the Irish and the Italians and feel what
it's like to be out from under the politically correct shield.
</P>
<P>
   It's open season in Hollywood, a copycat town that apparently
has got the message _ across the dial _ that it's OK to make fun of
gays. Here's a status report, based on viewing most of the pilots _
expect a continued barrage as the season goes on.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Grown Ups,'' the UPN series starring Jaleel ``Urkel''
White, there were nearly a dozen gay jokes. ``The man knows all the
lyrics to `Funny Girl,''' says one character, about a gay roommate.
Another: ``The best six words I've heard all week: My wife has a
lesbian friend.'' The friend is not gay, and says: ``Just because
I'm single and played freshman softball doesn't mean I'm a
lesbian.'' To which White says, ``No, but it's a red flag.''
</P>
<P>
   In Fox's ``Get Real,'' a girl doing a voice-over mentions she's
got bad news for her parents. The camera shows a poster of the
Indigo Girls, and she says, ``And, no, I'm not gay. Get real.''
Later her grandmother mentions the ``lesbian'' poster and asks the
question.
</P>
<P>
   In the NBC action series ``Third Watch'' it's not clear if an
older fireman is playing gay or not. He grabs another's butt, then
later says, ``When's the last time you've been with a man?'' By the
way, he's the station-house cook. And he gets gunned down brutally
in the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   In NBC's romantic comedy series ``Cold Feet,'' a woman worries
that the man she's interested in is gay. ``I'm sure he's gay. He's
got orange pants.'' Her female friend says: ``Orange pants?
Definitely not gay.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC's new David E. Kelley vehicle ``Snoops'' got some pre-pilot
buzz when it was suggested there was sexual tension between star
Gina Gershon (who played a lesbian in the film ``Bound'' and
appeared on the coming-out episode of ``Ellen'') and Paula
Marshall. Kelley said Gershon's role was written for a man. But
there were no direct gay jokes in the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   In CBS's sitcom, ``Work With Me'' a character says: ``We'll be
like Bert and Ernie _ but without the gay overtones.'' Another says
to a male co-worker: ``One day you'll meet a woman _ a woman,
right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh Grow Up,'' an ABC sitcom, features a character who realized
he was gay after he'd been married to a woman. ``Being gay and
having a wife are incompatible,'' he says. ``Unless you're a
politician or a movie star.''
</P>
<P>
   Another ABC comedy, ``Then Came You,'' has yet another gay man
who was married before. ``We fought over the silliest things. I
hated her cooking. She hated my homosexual affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies Man,'' a CBS sitcom, has a male character talking about
how great it would be to be gay, saying he wished he had ``the
strength to stroke a man like a pussycat.'' There are several jokes
spun from that routine.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, these are just the pilots. If they've gone to the gay
jokes this early, they certainly will return. And you probably can
count on other shows making stereotypical gay jokes as well.
</P>
<P>
   The new series ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' the very funny NBC sitcom, has
two gay characters and such jokes are essential to each episode.
Many continuing series also have showed no signs of restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, ethnic jokes in the modern PC world of television are
almost always forbidden _ except if they're aimed at the Irish or
Italians or, to some extent, the Polish.
</P>
<P>
   What the ``acceptance'' of gays has created is a field day for
writers who want to tip over what once was a sacred cow. Granted,
even a few of the best shows use gay jokes. Some of the jokes are
even funny.
</P>
<P>
   But with all manner of ethnic groups protesting their lack of
representation on the airwaves these days, you have to wonder if
gays soon will follow, complaining about being so common that they
are no longer sacrosanct.

`ACTION' TELLS THE BLEEPING TRUTH ABOUT TV
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Tonight refers to Thursday, Sept. 16)  
BY DAVID KRONKE 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Action'' is a ------- funny comedy, easily the
best sitcom of this ------- fall season. Sure, it may anoint pop
culture with the most deleted expletives since Nixon's Watergate
tapes. But what gets lost in complaints about how the show may
contribute to the coarsening of our culture is the fact that it
takes a knowing, acute and scabrously uproarious look at the very
people who are paid boggling gobs of money specifically for
coarsening our culture.
</P>
<P>
   Creator/executive producer Chris Thompson pours more than 20
years of personal experience into this satire of Hollywood hubris,
and the show entertains in the gleeful way in which it depicts
behavior that ranges from merely rude to outrageously appalling.
Our guide through this minefield of malice is Peter Dragon (Jay
Mohr), producer of schlockbusters who, as the series opens, is
coping with the failure of his latest action flick, the Christmas
release ``Slow Torture'' (alas, this means they'll never make
``Slow Torture 2: Now It's Unbearable'').
</P>
<P>
   Peter is related spiritually, if not directly, to Artie, Larry
Sanders' crass, irascible producer. It's not like the guy has
absolutely no principles _ for one thing, he refuses (thus far, at
least) to cast O.J. Simpson in one of his films, even though, as
Simpson's agent points out, children in Calcutta know his face.
Peter replies, ``Yeah, they know to run away from it.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's fiercely devoted to his head of security and uncle,
Lonnie (Buddy Hackett, Mohr's hero and mentor). (Go figure: Mohr
and Hackett last appeared together in a sweetly charming children's
movie, ``Paulie.'' Their ``Paulie'' co-star, Tony Shalhoub, will
soon air directly opposite them on NBC's upcoming, and
significantly inferior, ``Stark Raving Mad.'')
</P>
<P>
   But for a guy ostensibly on top of the world, Peter's life seems
in shambles. His wife left him to serve as the beard for the gay
but far more powerful and vicious studio mogul Bobby G, the only
man before whom Peter, for numerous reasons, wilts and who pulls
the plug on his next film. His production company just mistakenly
paid a quarter of a million dollars for a script he hates. A minion
observes, ``We've bought crappy scripts before,'' to which Dragon
responds, ``Yeah, but that was on purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter changes his mind when he encounters Wendy (Illeana
Douglas), a former child star turned hooker, on the way to ``Slow
Torture's'' premiere (in most sitcoms, couples meet cute; in
``Action'' they meet violent). He quickly assesses her as
invaluable simply because unlike the rest of his staff, she's no
sycophant. She tells the truth, and she happens to like that script
Dragon hates, ``Beverly Hills Gun Club.'' Peter decides to keep her
around; as the season progresses, we'll be party to the production
of Dragon's latest movie and see whether Wendy's script sense is
savvy enough to keep her off the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Mohr is very funny as Dragon, who is pathological in his ways:
Even when confronted with unimpeachable evidence of the truth, he
evenly and assuredly insists on his lies. Douglas serves as a fine
foil.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its toxic laughs, ``Action'' represents a gamble for its
creators and Fox, the network airing it. Mainstream audiences may
have trouble warming to the vitriolic characters, the bleeped
swearing and the show-biz minutiae; it also must compete against
NBC's long-sturdy (but cracking) Thursday night lineup. And even
the show's champions will no doubt find distracting the manner in
which the series adheres to network guidelines and avoids showing
Mohr's potty mouth while he makes verbal poo _ swirling cameras and
close-ups on Mohr's eyes will get old quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But adventurous viewers more in tune with cable rather than
network fare will want to accompany Peter and Wendy on their
excursion through the Neverland called Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight will feature two episodes _ the pilot, featuring a cameo
by Keanu Reeves, and an episode not made available for advance
screening because footage with Salma Hayek was added a couple of
weeks ago (or, in the TV vernacular, at the last minute). At least,
that's the network's excuse for not supplying the episode for
review, but ``Action'' will tell you, those in the entertainment
industry lie. &QL;

STATE WANTS IN ON THE `A' DEALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you ran a big pension fund in a city where venture
capitalists and buyout firms were making money hand over fist, it
would be only natural to want to get in on the action.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just what Massachusetts Treasurer Shannon O'Brien is
aiming to do. As head of the state's $27 billion public pension
fund, O'Brien wants to put more dollars into so-called
``alternative'' investments and boost returns as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sitting in one of the venture capital centers of the
country,'' says O'Brien. ``That is something we should be able to
take advantage of.''
</P>
<P>
   Buyout firms purchase stakes in private companies. Venture
capitalists provide seed money to brand-new businesses. Both types
of deals are considered alternative investments because they are
less liquid, less traditional, and higher risk than the stocks and
bonds pension funds typically purchase.
</P>
<P>
   The state's pension fund _ officially the Pension Reserves
Investment Management Board, or PRIM _ has been making buyout and
venture investments since 1986. At the moment about 4 percent of
the fund, or $1.2 billion, is tied up in alternative investments.
</P>
<P>
   Those investments haven't done badly. Over the past 13 years,
they have returned an average of 15 percent per year. Over the past
three years and five years, the returns have topped 20 percent
annually.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers haven't met the fund's own goals _ topping the
Standard &AMP; Poors 500 Index by 5 percentage points a year and
achieving results that beat 75 percent of comparable pension plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made money but we are poised to do better,'' says Scott
Henderson, PRIM's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   The past decade has been a golden age for buyout and venture
investing. Buyout specialists like Boston's Thomas Lee and Bain
Capital have doubled and tripled their money on deal after deal.
Venture capitalists have sometimes done even better, especially
when they have put money into fledgling technology companies. When
Siemens, the German technology giant, purchased two small
Massachusetts companies in March, the venture investors turned an
$18 million investment into $160 million in 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   Pension funds put up a chunk of the money the dealmakers use,
but in this world, just being willing to write a check is not
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone can get into `B' and `C' deals,'' says O'Brien. The
trick is to get into ``A'' deals, those offered by top names in the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Getting entry to that exclusive club requires cultivating the
right people and demonstrating a long-term commitment to this style
of investing.
</P>
<P>
   ``PRIM has had a fair amount of turnover over the years and that
is not healthy for maintaining the critical relationships you
need,'' says Steven Galante, editor of Private Equity Analyst, a
Wellesley newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   PRIM executives concede as much. The pension fund was not active
in venture investing in the early 1990s, so when venture firms went
looking for money later in the decade, they did not have
Massachusetts on their lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are not in the game and you have not been a reliable
investor, it is tough to break in,'' says Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   Venture firms can be particularly choosy about whose money they
use because they do not need to raise as much money as buyout
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Massachusetts is not giving up. PRIM officials have
targeted a series of top-tier venture and buyout firms they want to
get to know better. O'Brien hopes the relationship-building process
will get an assist from some of the heavy hitters who sit on PRIM's
investment committee.
</P>
<P>
   They include Jack Meyer, president of Harvard Management; Allan
Bufferd, MIT's treasurer; and a new addition to the group, David
Swensen, chief investment officer at Yale. The elite universities
have been leaders in the alternative investment field.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is convinced the time is right for putting lots of
new money into venture and buyout funds. They worry the eye-popping
returns generated in the field will attract too many eager
investors _ including PRIM.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a ton of money out there chasing a small number of
good deals,'' says Richard Charlton, president of New England
Pension Consultants, a Cambridge firm.
</P>
<P>
   But the state pension fund is committed to doing more. PRIM's
goal is to have 8 percent of the fund in alternative investments,
up from the current 4 percent. Given the nature of things, it will
be years before we know if that is a good idea.

INSULATION DOES A LOT TO SAVE HEAT, BUT NOT ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (First of two articles.)
</P>
<P>
   There is no better time than right now to insulate your house,
or add to insulation already there. Why now? You'll see graphic
savings in your heating bills, and can compare your bill at the end
of the season with past ones to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   If you insulate everywhere possible in your house, the savings
in heat will be amazing. You can save up to 50 percent, depending
on what you do. Actaully, insulation alone does not do it all.
Insulation must work with vapor barriers and other ways of
buttoning up to be fully effective.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the weather is cool and dry, or should be, at this time of
year, so if you do some of the work yourself, you will be more
comfortable. There is nothing quite so miserable as laying
fiberglass batts or blowing cellulose in an attic floor in hot,
muggy weather.
</P>
<P>
   So, how to begin?
</P>
<P>
   Begin by wearing protective clothing: especially a respirator
and goggles. Clothing to potect the skin is also good, but not as
important as a respirator and goggles unless you are allergic to
fiberglass. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The five w's &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, begin with an old newspaper instruction for reporters. When
writing a story, the reporter must be aware of the five w's
essential to that story: who, what, when, where, and why.
</P>
<P>
   We can apply that to insulation, too.
</P>
<P>
   1. Who? You, of course, can do some of the insulating yourself,
if you have the time and inclination. Other types of insulation,
such as blowing insualtion in walls cavitgies, are best done by
pros.
</P>
<P>
   2. What? Insulation, and the type of insulation is predominantly
fiberglass. Another insulation for certain applications, such as
blowing in walls, is cellulose. A third type, rigid board
insulation, includes Styrofoam and polyisocyanurate (isn't that a
great word; it make one feel so smart), also called High R
Sheathing and Thermax, among other brand names. Rigid insulation is
good in certain applications such as places where fiberglass or
cellulose is not practical to install.
</P>
<P>
   Insulation is the least expensive of the building products, and
probably does the most good. Fiberglass and cellulose cost about 25
to 50 cents a square foot; the rigid insulations are a lot more
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   3. When? We already mentioned when it is good to insulate, in
cool, dry weather. But insulation can be installed any time.
</P>
<P>
   4. Where? Any wall, ceiling, or floor that separates the heated
living space of a house from the outdoors or unheated space. These
walls, ceilings, and floors can not only be insulated, but in some
areas you can also add insulation.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, insulation was installed when the standards were
lower; less insulation was used. Today's standards are considerably
higher, so adding insulation is appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   5. Why? To save heat. And, insulation will save on cooling bills
as well.
</P>
<P>
   OK, let's go to work. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The attic floor &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First priority is the attic floor, because it easy for the
homeowner to do and saves the most heat.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose there is no insulation there at all. If there are
floorboards, take them up and put them aside. And be careful
walking on those exposed floor joists; it is a good idea to put
down a sheet of plywood to stand and kneel on when working over
open joists.
</P>
<P>
   Insert 6-inch-thick batts, or rolls, of fiberglass insulation
between the joists, with the paper backing, which is a vapor
barrier, down, touching the ceiling below.
</P>
<P>
   One cardinal rule in insulating a house is this: Always put the
vapor barrier (paper or polyethylene) toward the heated part of the
house.
</P>
<P>
   Six inches of insulation used to be standard; standard now is at
least 12 inches of fiberglass. So, after installing 6 inches, add
another 6 inches of unbacked fiberglass, and if the original 6-inch
inch piece comes up to the tops of the joists, or nearly so, put
the second 6-inch layer at right angles to the joists.
</P>
<P>
   A good insulaton for this purpose is Poly-Wrap, 8-inch-thick
fiberglass wrapped in perforated polyethylene, so it is not a vapor
barrier. The polyethylene of the Poly-Wrap (there are similar
products under different names) makes handling the material more
comfortable, and easy to position over insulation already there. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Keep the soffits clear &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another cardinal rule in laying insulation on an attic floor is
to avoid putting insulation in the soffits, which are where the
roof overhangs the wall. If this area is filled, serious
condensation problems can occur, and if the soffits are ventilated,
it obviously blocks the vents.
</P>
<P>
   Remember those floorboards that you put aside? You can't put
them back with 12 inches of insulation in place. If you want the
floorboards in place for storage, you cannot insulate above the
joists. A compromise is to put the floorboards in a small area of
the attic, adequate for storage, and put 12 inches in the rest of
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   If there is already insulation in place, you can add to it; the
attic floor is one of the few places where you can add insulation;
other areas just don't have the room.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want to take up the floorboards, you can have
cellulose or fiberglass blown in by a professional. Watch him like
a hawk to prevent blowing insulation into the soffits. When
insulation is blown in place, baffles are put at the end of each
joist space to prevent insulation from slopping into the soffit. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Ah, those cathedral ceilings &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you have a cathedral ceiling, and the ceiling finish
(plasterboard or other covering) has not been applied, you can
insulate that space by stapling 6-inch fibrglass between the
rafters, with the paper backing facing the room.
</P>
<P>
   But be sure to leave a 1-inch air space between insulation ion
and roof boards. To accomplish this air spce, staple Styrofoam
chutes to the roof between rafters before installing the
insulation.
</P>
<P>
   Serious moisture problems can occur if this is not done. To get
air flowing in tht space, install a ridge vent on the very top part
of the roof, and also soffit vents. Remember, the soffit is the
space created by the roof overhanging the wall. Vents go on the
underside of this overhang.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever said it is easy. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The basement ceiling &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Next place to insulate is the basement ceiling. This, too, you
can do yourself. But why bother, you might ask; doesn't hot air
rise, so the air in the house will not go down through the floor
and into the basement? And why not keep the basement warmer anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. Hot air does rise, but heat will definitely pass through
an uninsulated barrier (the floor) into a colder area such as the
basement. And anything that warms an unlived-in basement is wasted
heat.
</P>
<P>
   So, insulate the basement ceiling. Apply 6-inch Fiberglass
insulation with the paper backing up, touching the floorboards
above.
</P>
<P>
   Hold the insulation in place with insulation hangers, also
called lightning rods (they have nothing to do with lightning),
which are pointed wires stuffed between joists and spaced every 24
inches. They come in different lengths to accommodate joists 16 and
24 inches on center.
</P>
<P>
   The basement ceiling is a good place to use the poly-wrapped
insulation instead of the 6-inch variety. It is 8 inches thick and
can be stapled. But it is not a vapor barrier. It is a good idea,
if you use the poly-wrapped material, to staple polyethylene
plastic on the floorboards between joists, as a vapor barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes someone will put in the insulation with the paper
backing down. This is wrong, but if you do it this way, or find
your basement ceiling insulated this way, it may be OK. Just check
behind that paper; if it is damp, or wet, then you know why it is
wrong; that moisture has been trapped in the insulation, and now is
the time to reverse it. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Third priority: the walls &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Third priority is the walls. Insulating the walls of a two-story
house is more important than insulating the walls of a one-story
house because you will lose less heat through the walls of a
one-story house than those of a two-story house.
</P>
<P>
   However, any insulation in the walls is good, and blowing in
insulation _ fiberglass or cellulose _ is best left to
professionals, people who do this for a living. Blowing tools and
techniques have improved over the years, so there is no fear of
sagging or settling of the insulation.
</P>
<P>
   Blowing insulation into an existing house is quite an operation,
because insulation must be blown into all cavities between studs,
and under and over windows, and over doorways. Workers first remove
shingles or clapboards at the right places and drill holes through
the sheathing. In oirder to blow in insulation properly, a hole
must be drilled at the top and bottom of each wall cavity between
studs.
</P>
<P>
   Workers then insert a hose into each hole for blowing, then
cover the hole, and replace shingles or clapboards.
</P>
<P>
   On brick houses, insulators can make holes in the interior
walls. They can also make holes in the brick, filling them later
with brick-colored concrete. This latter trick is not a good idea.
Those patched bricks will stick out like sore thumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Drilling holes on the inside walls is not too bad, but remember,
the crewmen are insulators, not plasterers, and their filling of
the holes in the interior walls will not be so hot. But you can
smooth them out yourself, at your leisure.
</P>
<P>
   And as you enjoy fixing those hole patches, you can enjoy the
heat _ and money _ you are saving this winter, thanks to the
insulation. &QL; 
 &QL; 
NEXT: Plugging up any and all holes: vapor barriers, caulking,
windows, and doors. And sometimes, adding insulation. And don't
forget ventilation.

CAMPAIGN REFORM, OR CENSORSHIP? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It is September 2000. The election is less than two months
away, and campaign finance ``reform'' has been the law of the land
since January.
</P>
<P>
   You never really followed the campaign finance debates. Your
issue is term limits. You believe that most of what's wrong with
Washington is congressional careerism _ the fact that incumbents
are nearly impossible to dislodge and are obsessed with getting
reelected. That's why you joined Term Limits for Congress, an
activist group that works on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, your congressman is none other than Martin
Meehan, the Massachusetts Democrat who, with Republican Chris Shays
of Connecticut, co-authored the campaign finance bill that passed
the US House in September 1999 on a 252-177 vote. And on this
morning a year later, you are reading a column in The Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meehan is a decent guy who turned into a conniving pol once he
tasted power,'' the columnist writes. ``When he first ran for
Congress in 1992, he ardently championed term limits and promised
to abide by them. `I favor limiting members of Congress to four
terms,' Meehan said then, `and I commit to serve no longer than
that even if term-limit legislation is not enacted.' '' Time and
again, he repeated that vow. In 1995, after his first reelection,
he even sent a letter to the clerk of the US House saying that he
would rather resign than break his word and run in 2000. But he
lied. He's on the ballot again, running for the fifth term he swore
he'd never pursue.''
</P>
<P>
   Great stuff, you're thinking. You know all about Meehan's
deception, of course, and it makes your blood boil. Your very own
congressman, a term-limits turncoat!
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that your friends at Term Limits for Congress have
read the column, too, and have come up with an idea. They realize
Meehan is going to be reelected, but they at least want him know
that his betrayal isn't forgotten. The TLC plan is to air a
60-second commercial on local radio stations quoting some choice
passages from the newspaper column. ``All of us lose when
politicians break their word,'' the announcer will say at the end.
``Marty Meehan, you let us down.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial debuts on a Monday. On Wednesday, the radio
stations inform you and your friends that the spot is being pulled.
Meehan, it turns out, has filed a complaint with the Federal
Election Commission, accusing TLC of violating the Shays-Meehan
Campaign Finance Reform Act. You protest to the station manager
that everything in your ad is true, that it doesn't even call for
Meehan's defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry, fellas,'' the station manager says. ``I agree with you
about Meehan, but lawyer trouble is one thing I don't need.''
</P>
<P>
   You turn to your own lawyer. Can the government really censor a
group of citizens who want to buy some radio time to talk about a
candidate's record? It can, he reports. Under Section 201(b) of the
Shays-Meehan law, Congress has barred any organization from making
a ``communication'' that refers ``to one or more clearly identified
candidates in a paid advertisement that is transmitted through
radio or television within 60 calendar days preceding the date of
an election.'' In other words, Congress has made it illegal for any
interest group, within two months of Election Day, to so much as
mention a candidate's name in a commercial!
</P>
<P>
   You're floored. You thought Shays-Meehan was supposed to reform
politics, not strangle it. Whatever happened to the First
Amendment? ``Congress shall make no law . . . abridging freedom of
speech.'' Why is that columnist in The Boston Globe allowed to vent
his opinion of Meehan when TLC isn't? Is it only journalists who
have freedom of speech in this country?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The scenario is fiction, but only because Shays-Meehan has not
become law. If it ever is enacted, its effect will be not to clean
up campaigns, but to make them even less democratic and competitive
than they already are.
</P>
<P>
   Shays-Meehan (and its Senate counterpart, McCain-Feingold) is
about far more than banning ``soft money.'' It is about banning
criticism. The bill would smother the political speech of
grass-roots advocacy groups in red tape. It would make it almost
impossible for interest groups to issue voter guides to their
members. It would sharply expand the instances in which a citizen's
independent expenditure in support of a candidate _ say, printing
and distributing bumper stickers at his own expense _ would be
presumed to have been coordinated with the candidate, and thus
count as a campaign ``contribution.'' (Independent expenditures are
unregulated; contributions are limited to $1,000.)
</P>
<P>
   As much as campaign finance ``reformers'' may wish it were
otherwise, the Constitution does not permit the government to
control the quantity or tone of political debate. Shays, Meehan &AMP;
Co. denounce ``attack ads'' and ``negative campaigning,'' but the
First Amendment knows no such sins. One voter's attack ad is
another voter's simple truth.
</P>
<P>
   In America, citizens and groups have the right to influence
elections by communicating their views. Because communication costs
money, to limit what Americans can spend on political speech is to
limit what they can say. Shays and Meehan may see nothing wrong
with silencing their critics. Luckily for their critics, the
Constitution does.

ALVAREZ UP FOR NEW CHALLENGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The two most surprising teams in the 1994 World Cup
were probably Colombia and the United States. The Colombians failed
to meet expectations and their tournament ended in tragedy, and the
US exceeded expectations to form the basis for a professional
league.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Leonel de Jesus Alvarez Zuleta could not have imagined he
would someday leave Colombia to become a teammate of some of those
US players in their league. But Alvarez joined Major League Soccer
two years later and has become a fixture in the league, one of its
most credible and ardent advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez has adjusted quickly to New England _ he arrived in a
trade from Dallas Aug. 16 _ but the move has not been easy.
Alvarez's wife lost a baby after the first trimester, while she was
in Dallas and he was in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be better, but in life you face challenges,'' Alvarez
said Wednesday. ``And this is a time for a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez, 34, has brought cohesiveness and experience to the
Revolution midfield, and he has also revived the team's fighting
instincts. Most of the time Alvarez is a subtle enforcer. However,
Alvarez can assert himself, as he did in confronting Edwin Gorter
in the second half Saturday after Gorter had been cautioned for
kicking the Revolution's Mario Gori in a game that ended in a Miami
shootout victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution hope Alvarez's influence can help galvanize the
team for Saturday's game against Columbus, as they trail Miami by a
point for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference with
four games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team you saw against Miami was not lacking in heart,''
Alvarez said. ``It was not like when we lost to Tampa, 5-1 (Sept.
4). If we are a little more ambitious and convinced of our own
abilities, we can win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have become more united since the Tampa game. Hope is still
there, and with support of the fans we can qualify for the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez has an enforcer's reputation, and indeed he has endured
some difficult and malicious threats. During the 1994 World Cup,
Colombia faced pressures that are to difficult to describe within
the context of the US sporting paradigm. Player Andres Escobar was
killed in Medellin after Colombia had been eliminated. But such
threats had been carried out before and have been since. Alvarez,
like anyone who played in Colombia's Liga Dimayor, knew players,
referees, and politicians could be equally expendable in a country
in the midst of socioeconomic upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   In the US, Alvarez has encountered just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '94, we thought we were going to win against the US because
we had won every time we played a friendly,'' Alvarez said. ``But
they won the important one, and it wasn't luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like being in the US because there are a lot of good, young
players and they like it if you help them. Everything I do, I do
from the heart and it has been rewarding to work with these
players.''
</P>
<P>
   The first impression of Alvarez is that he is uncompromising,
even unapproachable. But fans and teammates are finding him to be
accessible and supportive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might not look it, but I am content,'' Alvarez said. ``I
would be happier if we were in a better position. But there are
other teams who are in the playoffs and we have much, much better
players and more quality than they have.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to be positive and keep our morale high. We can
win and we can win intelligently. But it is not going to be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Goalkeeper Jeff Causey, who was ejected from the shootout
Saturday night, will be eligible to play against Columbus . . .
Salvadoran striker Elias Montes will train with the Revolution for
two weeks before going to France for a tryout . . . John Harkes
(hamstring) is probable for Saturday . . . Dan Calichman suffered a
concussion in a collision with teammate Giovanni Savarese in
practice Wednesday at Babson College in Wellesley.

FURYK IS OUT TO WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ It must be a question he's constantly asked,
because Mike Furyk is ready with the explanation. Get out those
notebooks and pens.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got it square going back, and he's got it square going
through.''
</P>
<P>
   That's it?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it,'' he said. ``He won't hit it very far doing that,
but that's not his game. It's a simple swing. But that's his game.
That's his life. His swing is simple. His life is simple.''
</P>
<P>
   So it's not nuclear physics?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's his swing. He makes it work.''
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of work, Jim Furyk was in the middle of some at the
practice range following the third round of the recent NEC
Invitational in Akron, Ohio. But he wanted his swing coach, so he
nodded to his father to hurry things along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to get over there,'' said Mike Furyk, so the
interview was over. ``But it's a good swing. It really is.''
</P>
<P>
   There are millions of reasons to support Mike Furyk's
assessment, as in the nearly $6.5 million in prize money Jim Furyk
has earned since joining the PGA Tour in 1994. He's the most
consistent thing this side of a Hawaiian sunset, so steady, in
fact, that caddies have been known to call him ``T-4'' because he
is usually near the top of the leaderboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have another nickname,'' said Rick LaRose. ``I call him
ATM.''
</P>
<P>
   LaRose is the men's golf coach at the University of Arizona,
where future touring pros are as much a fixture of the landscape as
days without rain. ``But Furyk,'' said LaRose, ``had so much heart,
more than any player I ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   These were talented Arizona teams in the early 1990s, so that is
a bold statement. Robert Gamez was the star attraction when Furyk
arrived, then along came studs named Manny Zerman, David Berganio,
and Harry Rudolph. And though Furyk played on an NCAA championship
team, that was overshadowed by the exploits of the archrival at
Arizona State _ Phil Mickelson. The gifted lefthander won an NCAA
individual title, then the US Amateur.
</P>
<P>
   If you think the lack of attention bothered Furyk, think again.
``He's the most down-to-earth, normal person,'' said LaRose. ``I
mean, I've never seen a guy with so much notoriety stay the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that all the notoriety is for the right reasons, said Furyk.
To the contrary, there is the matter of his swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came out, it was the only issue anyone wanted to
talk about,'' said Furyk. ``If I shot 66 and came in to meet the
media, they would talk 25 minutes about my swing and five minutes
about the 66.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS analyst David Feherty jokes the swing looks like ``an
octopus falling out of a tree,'' and casual observers who wouldn't
know a 4-iron from a curling iron will tell you it doesn't look
right.
</P>
<P>
   Team Furyk is amused by it all. OK, it's not conventional. The
swing goes up, then out, then loops inside, but give them a little
credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that big a deal,'' said Jim, the son and student.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's square at impact. And the key is, he does the same swing
every time,'' said Mike, the father and teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Furyk is the reason Mike Furyk quit the golf business. He's
also the reason he got back into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a club pro (in Pennsylvania), but after Jim was born in
1970, I quit,'' said Mike. ``I wanted to have summer vacations and
coach Little League, so I got out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter the life of a salesman, though he never sold his son on
the game that now dominates his life. Jim Furyk bought that on his
own. ``He played golf because he wanted to play golf,'' said Mike.
``He asked me to help him, and I did, but he asked me.''
</P>
<P>
   There were countless summer days when Mike and Linda Furyk would
drive their only child to the golf course and drop him off. The key
phrase being ``drop him off.'' Jim was on his own to figure things
out and that mentality is still a hallmark of his success; the game
comes easier to many of his peers, but Furyk has never minded the
hard way to success.
</P>
<P>
   So it was no big deal if friends and teammates found immediate
fame while Furyk's first pro stop was something called the Hooters
Tour. He won and moved on to the Nike Tour. He won there, too;
twice. That got him to the big show and his first year saw him
finish 78th on the money list. Then 33d, then 26th, then fourth,
then third.
</P>
<P>
   He was so busy establishing himself on the PGA Tour, however,
that he didn't notice being noticed. That sort of snuck up on him,
which explains the strange feeling he had one day while driving
what was clearly marked a courtesy car. Suddenly he had this
thought: What if someone drives up to this car and peers in and
notices . . . Jim Furyk? Who is Jim Furyk?
</P>
<P>
   That's the side he gets from his mother, said LaRose.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of her in him. He always had a lot of common
sense and I'm sure it comes from her. He's been smart enough to
keep on being Jim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim is Jim. Give him credit.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one is more committed to tournament golf than Furyk. When he
enters a tournament, rarely does he leave early. He missed 14 cuts
his rookie season, but since has missed just 21 in 134 events. That
includes a solid stretch in majors _ in 18 starts he has missed
just one cut while registering six top 10s.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive, considering the depth of talent against which he
competes, but Furyk knows the critics are out there. They say he's
only won three times, low considering he's had 41 top-10 finishes
in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I want to win,'' said Furyk. ``I'd trade in some of
those top 10s to get in the winner's circle. But I don't finish in
the top 10 because I want to finish in the top 10. I finish there
because I'm trying to win.''
</P>
<P>
   He'd like a little credit for beating Nick Faldo in singles, 3
and 2, at the 1997 Ryder Cup, and as he prepares to play again for
the United States in next week's matches at The Country Club, it
deserves mention that Furyk sets up as a premier match-play player.
</P>
<P>
   That's because he's so patient, so unwavering in his commitment
to his abilities, said Mike Furyk.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Jim does is play his own game,'' he said. ``He won't
overpower golf courses, but he plays hard courses well, where
there's a premium on par. He just doesn't force things.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a team concept, remember, said the elder Furyk, ``If
(Jim) is your friend, he's your friend and you don't have to worry
about him running hot and cold.''
</P>
<P>
   These friends range from the stars (David Duval) to the
unheralded journeymen (Bob Burns, Guy Boros, Berganio), to his high
school buddies, and they will tell you that Furyk is a Ford Bronco
and Pizza Hut guy, though Mike Furyk sounds almost apologetic when
he concedes his son recently splurged by buying a boat.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, a crack in the image? Furyk joins another in a long line of
pro golfers with expensive toys?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an 18-foot boat,'' said Mike Furyk. ``It's not a ship. I
mean, there's no crew or anything.''

   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ John Cornish had a feeling he might be
twisting in the wind before this Ryder Cup was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a surprise,'' said Cornish, chairman of The Country
Club's Ryder Cup Committee. ``When the Farmer's Almanac came out
for 1999, it predicted that we could have a bad hurricane season,
and that stayed in the back of my mind. Now it is here.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornish, and course superintendent Bill Spence, are not only
concerned about Hurricane Floyd, they're also keeping an eye on
Gert, the next in line. Although forecasters are now saying it
won't affect the Boston area, Gert could provide the big hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to do everything possible to make sure this event
goes as scheduled,'' said Cornish, ``so over the next few days we
are going to be into crisis management.''
</P>
<P>
   Picture this: The Country Club at Brookline, host for the Ryder
Cup, beginning with practice rounds scheduled to begin Tuesday,
with match play starting Friday and concluding the following
Sunday, and the world watching. The event has been in the planning
stages for five years. The tickets have been distributed. Some
33,000 patrons are expected each day. More than 200 corporate tents
have been assembled. However, even the best of those are designed
to handle winds just up to 60 to 70 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   If Floyd or Gert come calling, the winds could be much higher
than that, and there is no telling where the tents could wind up.
Maybe in Worcester, the sight of the original Ryder Cupin 1925.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have moved machines and people into place to prepare for
what might come,'' said Bill Spence, who is in charge of making the
course playable. ``Losing trees could be a problem, but I have
confidence it won't be. We lost about 40 or 50 to a hurricane back
in 1985, and since that we have continued a very intensive tree
program. This past year, for safety reasons more than anticipating
any hurricanes, we have had continuous pruning by arborists from
Hunt and Hulteen. We have taken down all of the trees, and branches
on trees, that we thought might be hazardous.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, we had that April Fools' Day surprise snowstorm,
and when I drove up the driveway that day coming into the club, I
was really happy. We had done such a good job with the trees, we
didn't have any damage. Meanwhile, the Arnold Arboretum, which is
just a mile or so away, had severe damage.''
</P>
<P>
   If and when the high winds come to Brookline, the arborists will
swing into action. ``We have emergency lighting available and can
use it to work all night,'' said Spence. ``I am very confident that
no matter what we get, our golf course will be very playable for
this event. If we have to, we will start the cleanup process as
soon as the winds subside.''
</P>
<P>
   Water is already being drained from the seven ponds on the
property, in preparation for the heavy rain that might come. That
will allow the course to drain easier into the collection areas,
which will have been emptied.
</P>
<P>
   Cornish and his emergency planning committee of Spence, Ken
Burns, Mike Gilligan of the PGA, and Rich Kelleher from the town of
Brookline, have another list of potential problems to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get too much rain, and it is very wet, we will not have
parking at our three immediate local areas, Putterham (Meadows),
Larz Andersen (Park), and Allandale Farm. We do not want to do
damage to these areas. This is when our emergency parking plan will
kick in. We have a fleet of shuttle buses standing by, and they
won't be used unless it is for a parking emergency. If this
happens, people will be bused in from the parking lots at
Foxborough and the Dedham Mall instead.''
</P>
<P>
   The most unfortunate scenario would be for Gert to blow into
Brookline late next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a rain date agreement with the PGA,'' said Cornish.
``That would have the final day on Monday. Everything would be
pushed back to Monday. We wouldn't have more than one rain day.
Many of the golfers have commitments and have to leave town. The
matches could be reduced to two days instead of three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, in Valderrama (Spain), there were very heavy
rains on Friday and Saturday. Matches were delayed late into the
day, and some could not be finished until the next day. If this is
what we would have to do, due to the weather, then this is what we
will do, but all of us will be doing a lot of praying until this
thing is over.''

SPACEY'S `BEAUTY' OF A ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It isn't true that life begins at 40, at least not for Kevin
Spacey. Professionally speaking, Spacey, who turned 40 in July, has
been surfing a jet stream since 1995, when he imprinted himself on
our collective consciousness as the most unusual of ``The Usual
Suspects.'' He gave Hollywood its archetypal crazed movie exec in
``Swimming With Sharks,'' turned slightly more lethal as the
manipulative serial killer in the Stygian ``Seven,'' and seemed to
surprise even himself as a smooth cop working both sides of the
street, then rediscovering his idealism, in ``L.A. Confidential.''
Spacey's performances always start in his eyes, bright with
sentience and intelligence, often mocking, tantalizing audiences
with the message that he knows something they don't know, and want
to.
</P>
<P>
   In his new film, the Boston Film Festival hit ``American
Beauty,'' opening its commercial run Friday, Spacey's very funny,
very sad role seems custom-made, although he swears it was all in
the script except for a very small bit of on-site fine-tuning. As
Lester Burnham, a suburbanite dancing on the wilder shores of what
everyone around him sees as a midlife crisis but he sees as a
reprieve, Spacey plays a dropout taking verbal potshots at an empty
suburban lifestyle with deadly accurate aim. Lester drives his
tightly wound wife, played by Annette Bening, around the bend and
doesn't endear himself to his angry teenage daughter when he lusts
after the latter's blond cheerleader girlfriend. He starts pumping
iron to impress her after blowing off his job and spending a huge
chunk of his severance package on a red sports car.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage between persona and material here is, in short,
ideal. It's the kind of performance Oscars were invented for, but
although it taps into his flair for irony, Spacey says that one of
the reasons he wanted the role was for the chance it gave him to
move away from playing string pullers and take a crack at a guy in
free fall. ``I was trying to move away from darker manipulative
characters who are 10 steps ahead of everybody else. I wanted to
play characters that are much more vulnerable, much more personal
to me, living moment to moment,'' he says, too cool to mention that
he is at that instant living moment to moment, waiting in a
downtown hotel suite for a suit to return from the cleaners so he
can change into it and rush off to accept a career award at the
festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had tried from `L.A. Confidential' on to do roles that were
on more shifting ground, playing characters that weren't
necessarily evil or manipulative or villainous. So I was walking
toward this direction anyway,'' he adds. ``Lester's like a lot of
men who hate their job, hate their boss, have no real relationship
with their wife and nothing in common with their children. He's
kinda going through the motions. And I think anyone going through
that recognizes that they have to break out of that, sort of move
forward and change, shake it up. That feeling of being trapped and
needing to escape leads to something quite beautiful and peaceful
and harmonious. I don't think he perceives the things he does as
self-destructive. I think he perceives it as a reaching into
himself for something that has gotten lost along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Spacey laughs when he is told that first-time film director and
acclaimed stager of the Broadway revival of ``Cabaret'' Sam Mendes
described Spacey as having built his character from the inside out.
``I'd say it was from the outside in,'' Spacey says. ``I trained
for about four months before we started. Then we trained every day
on the set. And ate right. I just had to be in the best shape
possible (to look convincingly buff). A lot of the preparation was
the body work, the physical work. Then I had to do the schlumpy
version of Lester. I had to collapse him very slowly, almost
command the fall.'' It helped, Spacey says, that he and Bening and
Mendes come from the world of the stage and, in a departure from
the schedule followed by most Hollywood films, rehearsed for
several weeks before shooting, worked out back stories, and (to
break the tension in this darkly funny film) laughed a lot between
takes. ``We were laughing about 17 hours a day,'' Spacey says. ``I
thought we'd never get through the dinner-table argument because we
couldn't stop laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   The trick now, as Spacey sees it, is to not let success cut him
off from the things that got him where he is. ``It can be like a
kind of death,'' Spacey says, ``that cuts you off from the kind of
things going on inside. For many people who become successful, the
houses move further up the hills and walls around the houses become
taller. But if you're an actor or an artist you need to stay in
touch. One of the reasons I moved to New York is that you cannot
get away from reality there, unless you stay in your apartment all
the time. You have to not buy into the trappings of what success
for an actor means in our modern world. It's important for an actor
to be around people. I mean, I can tell more about a person from
the way they treat a waiter than the way they treat their wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an actor, I just have to keep being diligent about the kind
of things I take on. The seductions are out there all the time, but
you have to make sure that the things you're moving toward are the
right things, the things that make me want to get up out of bed in
the morning. Look, I put myself quite carefully in these large
ensemble films for really the last seven years. And part of that
was that I wasn't really interested in having a movie on my
shoulders. Whether you are playing a leading role or a featured
role, it makes no difference to me. It's just about the story and
about doing something that will catch on with audiences. I want to
make a movie that will last for years. I really don't give a crap
about how it does the first weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Spacey came to acting with the best possible pedigree _ being
led to it by a high school guidance counselor after he was thrown
out of military school in California, where his parents and two
siblings had moved from New Jersey, where Spacey was born. ``I was
thrown into military school and then thrown out of military
school,'' he recalls. ``It did not an ounce of good, except that it
turned me off violence, which I suppose is a good thing. Four days
after I was thrown out, I got a medal in the mail. For leadership.
I was a little terror until I found theater. I didn't know what I
wanted, and I felt isolated. Then I had these memorable experiences
in high school theater and it shifted to, well, maybe I can really
do this. When I was this little snot-nosed 13-year-old kid,
Katharine Hepburn was appearing in a play in Los Angeles. I found
out where her car was parked and waited for her and presented her
with a bouquet of roses and told her how much I admired her and
Spencer Tracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I did in high school was see a play with
Jack Lemmon in it. Later, we worked in the same film, `Glengarry
Glen Ross.' When he played James O'Neill in the 1986 revival of
`Long Day's Journey Into Night,' I played Jamie. One night Hepburn
appeared backstage. She had made the mistake when we first met of
saying, `Keep in touch.' So I would send her these long-winded
letters, and she would reply with something like, `Dear Kevin. Good
for you. Kate.' '' Spacey does a good Hepburn imitation without
missing a beat. He segued as smoothly into directing, making his
debut with ``Albino Alligator.'' He'll direct again.
</P>
<P>
   Spacey also likes wearing a producer's hat. He and Danny De Vito
produced an upcoming comedy in which they also star, ``Hospitality
Suite.'' ``We play industrial lubricant salesmen at a convention in
Kansas City,'' Spacey says. ``I'll tell you what I like about
producing. We have a first-time director, a first-time actor
playing a leading role, a first-time screenwriter, a first-time
editor. I want to use my company as a conduit to give talented
people and in some cases longstanding friends opportunities.'' As
if on cue, there's a knock on the door. It isn't opportunity
knocking. It's an aide bearing the freshly cleaned suit. And off
Spacey goes.

   Jazz-Mahogany: KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Just six years ago, Kevin
Mahogany supported himself by working as a data processor while
pursuing a dream: to be a jazz singer. In nightclubs all over
Kansas City he chased that dream relentlessly, applying his rich
baritone to the standard jazz repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he always sang jazz. Sometimes he lent his talents to
R&AMP;B or pop. But it all helped him to connect with audiences in
places like the Club at Plaza III and come to an understanding of
his gifts as a performer. And even when the dream seemed out of
reach, it was always on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Mahogany, 41, is a star. A big man with charm to match, he
performs in such top-flight New York clubs as Birdland and Iridium,
is a favorite at jazz festivals nationally and internationally, and
has six well-received albums in the racks. In a critics' poll in
Down Beat magazine he was recently named Best Male Jazz Vocalist of
the year. Calvin Wilson. 1600 words.

ACID `ACTION' A SMART ANTIDOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
ACTION 
Starring: Jay Mohr, Illeana Douglas, Buddy Hackett 
On: Fox 
Time: Thursdays at 9:30. 
Rated: TVMA 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Action'' may be one of the most satirical shows ever to
puncture the happy daze of network TV comedy. It's a razor sharp
take on Hollywood, USA, where all the sharks have perfectly capped
teeth and Xanax dust around the gills. In the same nasty way that
HBO's ``The Larry Sanders Show'' roasted late-night talkers,
``Action'' lampoons the amoral moneybags behind the violent
blockbusters that break box office records each week. It's a
cynical, adult half-hour that is so extremely uncute, we might be
wrong-headed to think of it as a sitcom in the way ``Friends'' is a
sitcom. Let's call it a venomcom.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of ``Action,'' which premieres Thursday, Sept. 16 with
episodes at 9 and 9:30, is that it's co-produced by Joel Silver,
the brash maker of bloated action flicks like the ``Die Hard,''
``Lethal Weapon,'' and ``Predator'' series. Silver apparently has a
sense of humor (or self-loathing) about himself and the absurdities
of his big-budget world, because the gags in ``Action'' revolve
around Silver-esque projects with wonderfully silly names like
``Slow Torture'' and ``The Beverly Hills Gun Club.'' And of course
there's the show's central character, a slimeball action producer
who has no conscience and who has acid running through his veins.
His perfect name: Peter Dragon. The perfect actor who plays him:
Jay Mohr, best known as the two-faced agent from ``Jerry Maguire.''
</P>
<P>
   The premiere of ``Action'' is directed by Ted Demme, the
director of ``The Ref'' and ``Beautiful Girls'' who cut his chops
at MTV in the late 1980s. Demme brings all his in-your-face
music-video panache to the show right from the start, as Dragon
steals a studio parking space reserved for the Employee of the
Month, a commisary worker named Manny. Manny confronts Dragon, and
the camera swirls dizzyingly around them as Dragon flames Manny
with an obscenity-ridden (and bleeped out) rant: ``I've made 10
motion pictures that have earned this studio a billion dollars.
Unfortunately for you, I am the employee of the bleeping century.''
A few fast edits later, Dragon is breathing fire into his cell
phone, yelling, ``She can come to the premiere, she can come to the
post-premiere party, but she cannot come to the post-premiere
party-party.'' The show moves at Dragon's teeth-grinding,
amphetamine pace.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem facing ``Action,'' aside from its placement
opposite NBC's Must-See TV, is whether viewers will welcome such a
convincingly unlikable character into their homes each week. My
guess is that Mohr's Dragon will grow more sympathetic as we see
him increasingly subjected to the humiliations of the studio food
chain. The more you watch Mohr, the more you see his Dragon as an
oversized child whose sarcasm is born of insecurity and justified
paranoia. He knows all too well that producers are only as hot as
their last domestic gross. On the way to the premiere of his ``Slow
Torture,'' he's so nervous he vomits out the door of his limousine.
Later, he'll have to answer for his box-office shortcomings to a
gay mogul who happens to be married to Dragon's ex-wife. The bald
mogul, said to be modeled after Fox's Barry Diller, is famous for
his insanely large penis, which Dragon glimpses in one of the
racier scenes.
</P>
<P>
   The show also makes Dragon less abrasive by giving him two
quirkily likable consorts. He falls in with an unimpressed hooker
named Wendy Ward (yes, Peter and Wendy), who becomes his muse and
script reader. Played by the wonderfully wry-eyed Illeana Douglas,
Wendy is a fallen child star and recovering coke addict who is
actually resigned to not making it on the big screen. And Dragon's
benevolent limo driver and uncle is played with a hint of
sentimentality by none other than Buddy Hackett. The ``Action''
producers also promise plenty of funny, self-mocking cameos, like
those in the movie ``The Player'' and shows like ``Larry Sanders''
and ``Lateline.'' Keanu Reeves, who recently starred in Silver's
``The Matrix,'' shows up to goof on the low IQ of action fans while
Wendy performs a sexual favor on him.
</P>
<P>
   Since ``Action'' was previewed for critics over the summer, it
has been hyped as either the savior of the fall season or the cause
of the decline of Western civilization. Originally created for HBO
by Silver and ``Larry Sanders'' alum Chris Thompson before Fox
scooped it up, it is an alarm clock of bleeped-out obscenities with
nonstop sexual situations and jokes about gays and Jews. (The
premiere has an ongoing confusion between screenwriters Adam Rafkin
and Alan Rifkin, with Dragon exclaiming, ``You're telling me we
spent a quarter of a million dollars for the wrong Jew?'') This is
a comedy whose main conceit of Hollwood is prostitution. What this
means is that parents should keep children away from the show,
despite the fact that it airs on a network, and not pay TV.
</P>
<P>
   But for adults, ``Action,'' which does not have a laugh track,
is a smart and healthy antidote to so much of the Hollywood puffery
that envelops us, from glitzy magazines and incessant ad campaigns
to the weekly box office contest. It is a frank depiction of the
vulgar battle that Hollywood is waging on our souls. And, as
``Action'' shows us, there are more than a few atheists in those
studio foxholes.

EVEN BETTER THAN LINUX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Linux operating system has gotten a tremendous amount of
publicity in recent months. Millions of computers are running
Linux, it is playing an increasingly important role in business,
and people are beginning to think Linux might be a credible threat
to the dominance of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm not rejoicing for the ascendancy of Linux or its penguin
mascot. I have my two feet firmly planted in another camp. No, I'm
not rooting for Bill Gates and the Redmond home team. Instead, I've
thrown my lot in with a trio of operating systems that all end with
the initials BSD.
</P>
<P>
   At my home, I run an operating system called NetBSD on the
computer that's connected to my MediaOne cable modem. This NetBSD
machine is my file server and my print server. It also runs a
system called NAT (network address translation) that lets me access
the Internet from the other computers on my home network. I
installed NetBSD on the computer a little more than a year ago, and
it has been working well for me ever since.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to understand that everything I do with NetBSD I
could do just as easily with Linux. That's because there are far
more similarities between the two systems than differences. Both
are based on the Unix operating system, developed at Bell Labs in
the 1970s, and both can be freely redistributed. The big difference
is portability. While Linux can only run on a few kinds of
computers, NetBSD can run on more than 22, including
Intel-compatible PCs, Amigas, old 68000-based Macs, Digital VAXes,
and even those sleek but defunct NeXT workstations. This has made
the system popular at places like MIT and NASA, both of which have
large menageries of computer systems from a multitude of vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year there were a number of well-publicized
security problems involving the Linux operating system. During that
time my computer was frequently attacked. However, since I wasn't
running Linux, I wasn't vulnerable. Linux is the favored operating
system for most of the attackers on the Internet, which is another
reason I don't use it.
</P>
<P>
   Last month I set up a high-performance database server. This
machine runs FreeBSD, a different version of the BSD operating
system. FreeBSD has gained notoriety in recent weeks because it
powers Yahoo and Hotmail. The operating system also has a
reputation for never crashing _ while offering high performance and
leading-edge features. I chose FreeBSD for the database server
because FreeBSD has exceptionally good support for multiple
execution threads within a single process, allowing the database
server to be more responsive when more than one person is using it
at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   OpenBSD is the ultra-secure version of BSD developed by
programmers in Canada. Although all the BSD systems are reasonably
secure, the dozen people who created OpenBSD spent more than four
years doing a line-by-line audit of it, fixing security pitfalls
other Unix vendors haven't even conceived.
</P>
<P>
   Because the OpenBSD team is based in Canada, it isn't hobbled by
the antiquarian export control laws that stifle much of the US
software industry. As a result, OpenBSD comes with military-grade
cryptography deeply integrated into the core system. OpenBSD also
comes with IPsec, the cryptographic extensions to the Internet's
TCP/IP protocol that let systems automatically encrypt information
before it is sent over the wire. This is the same software other
companies sell for thousands of dollars. It's free with OpenBSD.
(NetBSD should have a full implementation of IPsec by the end of
the year; a version of IPsec is also available for Linux, but it
isn't built-in.) All of these combine to make the operating system
a good choice for firewalls and the paranoid.
</P>
<P>
   The three BSD operating systems are all descended from the BSD
version of Unix developed at the University of California at
Berkeley during the 1980s (``BSD'' stands for Berkeley Standard
Distribution). They're also the descendants of Project GNU, started
by Richard Stallman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
There's a lot of infighting among the groups developing these three
systems, but there's also a lot of cooperation, since all are
distributed in source code. All can run most programs that are
written for Linux, and frequently they can run the programs faster
than Linux itself.
</P>
<P>
   If I had to pick out the single difference between the BSD
community as a whole and the proponents of Linux, I would say it is
something called ``correctness.'' The BSD developers are more
concerned that the underlying technology in their operating systems
be implemented in a manner consistent with the overall design of
the systems. Linux developers, overall, are more interested in just
putting together something that works.
</P>
<P>
   Another big difference is commercialism. Where the BSD projects
are largely the work of individuals, businesses are now the driving
force in the Linux community. This may be one reason proponents of
Linux are frequently slow to admit the debt they owe to the
Computer Science Research Group at Berkeley, which created BSD, and
to the Free Software Foundation at MIT, the charitable organization
that raised money for Project GNU. Although Linus Torvalds
frequently gets the credit for creating Linux, he only wrote the
system's kernel. The rest he cobbled together from other sources,
largely BSD and GNU.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk McKusick wrote an excellent history of BSD in his essay
``Twenty Years of Berkeley Unix.'' You can find it in the book
``Open Sources,'' published by O'Reilly &AMP; Associates. It is also on
line, along with the rest of the book, at
www.oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/kirkmck.html.
</P>
<P>
   Although Linux is a fine operating system, I would encourage
businesses as well as advanced enthusiasts to take a serious look
at the other choices.

ELIMINATING PAPER SPEEDS MEDICAL ADVANCES

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- As part of its ordeal to get permission to market its
drug to treat rheumatoid arthritis, Celebrex, G.D. Searle at one
point sent an 18-wheel truck to the US Food and Drug
Administration, loaded with pallets of paper records on 14,000
people who had participated in 61 clinical trials over a five-year
period.
</P>
<P>
   While computers seem to be everywhere in medicine these days,
with consumers able to go on line to buy Viagra and Prozac or seek
out medical advice from Dr. C. Everett Koop, the former US surgeon
general, they have been slow to make their way into the grueling
research and government approval process _ regarded by many as the
biggest roadblock in delivering medical advances.
</P>
<P>
   From drug makers and hospitals to physicians and insurers, the
health care industry is looking to get off the slow-moving paper
trail and somehow drive on to the Internet superhighway.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most conspicuous barrier is within the FDA itself,
which only began using computers eight years ago and still relies
on, literally, truckloads of handwritten paper documents from
patients, physicians, and other medical professionals collected by
pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   And much of that data still had to be entered into a computer
system, with an army of people needed to make sure nothing was
missing and no mistakes were made in transcription.
</P>
<P>
   Watching this mountain of paper grow, several emerging
companies, including two in the Boston area, have begun working
with the FDA on procedures for electronic capture of patient
information in ways that would cut clinical trial costs, speed up
decision-making, and ultimately lower the price of new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   One is PHT Corp. of Boston, which is working with four of the
nation's 10 largest pharmaceutical companies on ways to capture
detailed patient information during a clinical trial using
PalmPilots, the hand-held scheduler and electronic mail device
developed by 3Com Corp.
</P>
<P>
   PHT, formerly Personal Health Technology, buys the PalmPilots
and strips out the business software, replacing it with custom
programs that record and transmit
</P>
<P>
   patient data via the Internet, first to PHT's own computers and
then to the pharmaceutical company sponsoring the drug test.
</P>
<P>
   Called the PlexxNet Patient LogPad, it is meant to replace the
unreliable paper diaries used in 20 percent of clinical trials
worldwide. The pitfalls in diaries are numerous, including patients
often forgetting to write down when they took their medication or
how they felt afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average compliance with paper diaries is about 50
percent,'' said James Becker, PHT's chief operating officer. ``That
means pharmaceutical companies have to throw out a lot of data from
participants. Some clinical researchers say that some participants
will fill out their diaries in the parking lot just before seeing
their physician.''
</P>
<P>
   With LogPads, he said, patients are required to report their
data daily via telephone modem. They respond to questions with
yes-or-no boxes; describe pain intensity by touching a point on a
simple graph; and indicate where they felt the pain by tapping on
an outline diagram of a human body. The unit can also be programmed
to deliver timely reminders for taking medication. Each patient
also can write a short message before signing off with his initials
and sending in their report.
</P>
<P>
   Becker and PHT cofounder Stephen Raymond say LogPad patients are
more conscientious, with compliance in one clinical trial that used
the units at more than 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   PHT charges pharmaceutical firms $300,000 to $400,000 for a
trial involving 200 to 300 patients, a fee that includes custom
programming and related computer and Internet services. Becker said
more than 1,000 LogPads will be in use by the end of this month,
most of them for early-stage trials involving pain, angina, and
smoking cessation.
</P>
<P>
   LogPad still requires training users, sometimes a problem with
elderly patients. But Raymond says the typical participant is
trained in less than 30 minutes. And if data is not sent in on
time, a manager knows this immediately and can follow up. Missed
days in paper diaries sometimes aren't detected for a week or more.
</P>
<P>
   Another start-up is Phase Forward Inc. of Waltham, which picks
up where PHT's LogPad leaves off. Phase Forward provides clinical
data management services for drug companies and the firms they hire
to conduct clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors or other health care personnel who work with patients
involved in these drug experiments type their records and
observations directly into desktop computers and send this data
instantly to Phase Forward, which then forwards these files to the
research administrators.
</P>
<P>
   This system replaces a hodge-podge of faxes, phone-call memos,
and paper records _ typically 50 to 100 pages for each of the
hundreds and sometimes thousands of patients who take part in
clinical trials _ with a single digital database.
</P>
<P>
   Once in place, that database that can be repeatedly used to
analyze, review, and verify information the trial is under way, and
then submitted electronically to the FDA for its review.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting information on line where clinical trial researchers
could enter and access information directly could reduce the delays
and overall time needed for FDA approval by at least 25 percent,''
said Dr. Lee S. Simon, associate professor of medicine at Harvard
Medical School and director of clinical research in rheumatology at
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Bleicher, Phase Forward's cofounder and chairman,
estimates the current processing delay of 12 to 15 weeks that
follows each clinical trial could be reduced to two days using
electronic data captured over the Web. ``Right now about 10 to 15
percent of the clinical trials are done electronically, which we
think will climb to more than 85 percent in the next five years,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Phase Forward's cofounder is Richard Dale, who previously worked
at Vermeer, a Cambridge developer of Web-based desktop publishing
software that was acquired by Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Bleicher, who once ran clinical trials for Alpha-Beta Technology
Inc. of Worcester, which is now out of business, spent 2 1/2 months
working with Dale to develop the company's business plan.
</P>
<P>
   Phase Forward charges $100,000 to $300,000 for its services
depending on the magnitude of the clinical trial. The company has
105 employees, and was launched two years ago with $400,000 in
private investment, followed by $4 million in venture funding from
Atlas Venture in Boston and North Bridge Venture Partners in
Waltham. It recently received another $8 million from those two
sources plus Sprout Group of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond clinical trials, other start-ups are trying to provide
more Internet tools to physicians, insurers, and hospitals with the
goal of creating a global network of computers for all players in
the health care system. For example, 10,000 PalmPilots are being
distributed to doctors nationwide by ePhysician, of Mountain View,
Calif., to use for direct submission of prescriptions to pharmacies
and access to results of lab tests.

`THE MATRIX' ON DVD EXPLAINS A LOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``What is the Matrix?'' was the advertising hook
when the movie was in theaters. Well, now we know, and it isn't
just a hit movie starring Keanu Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's really a fantastic new DVD, which hits stores Tuesday.
If critics quibbled over ``The Matrix's'' value as a sci-fi movie,
none of them denied the fact that the special effects in the film
are groundbreaking and jaw dropping.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the new DVD, you can see how many of the film's
effects and action sequences were shot. For anyone who wants a
glimpse into the future of filmmaking, this DVD is a must _ if you
don't have a DVD player, it's almost worth buying one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Matrix,'' written and directed by Larry and Andy
Wachowski, was shot in Australia for a fairly modest amount
compared to most overbloated special-effects-laden films. The
Wachowskis, as they tell you in one of the DVD's featurettes, were
originally asked to come up with a concept for a comic book but
were intrigued with the idea of combining that and Japanese
animation (anime) to create a live-action film. Throw in a
cyber-punk attitude and some high-flying Hong Kong martial arts,
and it was clear that the Wachowskis had to get innovative in order
to see their vision through and not be sunk by a ``Titanic''-size
budget. Thanks to advances in computers, they succeeded fabulously.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of ways to watch ``The Matrix'' on DVD, but
one of the most interesting is to ``Follow the White Rabbit.'' In
the movie, Reeves' character (Neo) is given that line as a clue. On
the DVD, a white rabbit flashes to alert you that, with the click
of a button, you can jump to a featurette that shows how the effect
or action sequence you're watching was done. There are nine
altogether, including one that shows how Reeves and co-star
Lawrence Fishburne, who plays Morpheus, trained and rehearsed for
one of those martial-arts fight sequences that required the use of
wires so the actors could make those fantastic jumps and spins.
</P>
<P>
   As actress Carrie-Anne Moss, who plays Trinity, explains in
another commentary, the Wachowskis insisted that all the actors do
their own stunts and she trained for six months to get ready. In
that feature, she is joined by the film's editor, Zach Staenberg,
and visual-effects supervisor John Gaeta, who tells Moss at one
point how they used computer-generation to make her legs look more
real in a scene.
</P>
<P>
   If you saw the film, you may have wondered how those bullets
flashed by Reeves at various speeds. This is explained in a segment
called ``What Is Bullet Time?'' The shorthand is a lot of cameras,
green screen and computers, but suffice it to say the explanation,
to quote Mr. Spock, is fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   The DVD contains numerous features, including other segments on
effects, an isolated music score with commentary by composer Don
Davis, behind-the-scenes material such as production notes, the
theatrical trailers and HBO's documentary ``First Look: Making the
Matrix.''
</P>
<P>
   If that isn't enough, and if you have a computer with DVD-ROM
capabilities, you can read the screenplay and follow the film's
progress by viewing each scene's storyboard, stills and final cut.
You can also link online to a number of ``Matrix''-related sites.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah, if you just want to watch the film, the video also
comes out on Tuesday, but it's priced for rental ($109.99). The DVD
is selling for $24.90, and some Web sites are advertising it for
$14.99.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Morpheus asks Neo, ``What is reality?'' The answer
is ``electrical signal interpreted by the brain,'' implying that
reality can be altered. The Wachowskis have already altered film
reality, and you'll be seeing the effects for years to come. &QL;

VOLVO V40 RETAINS SAFETY, BUT NO PLODDING NATURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Certain cars generate a public buzz, not just before they hit
the showrooms, but before they even get into the hands of lucky
souls like me, who get to test drive them.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the Audi TT and the Toyota Tundra pickup truck rolled
in accompanied by that buzz. There is a great anticipatory buzz
over the imminent appearance of the Honda S2000, a two-seater with
an engine that buzzes like a hornet.
</P>
<P>
   And there has been much buzzing over a car that has just hit
showrooms, the so-called ``cheap'' Volvo _ cheap as in inexpensive,
not poorly made _ if you consider base prices of $22,900 (S40
sedan) and $23,900 (V40 wagon) to be cheap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will it really be a Volvo?'' many folks have asked me.
</P>
<P>
   So when I first approached the V40 a few days back, I did what
any fine-tuned expert wanting to check out the quality of a car
would do _ I opened each door and slammed it. Ca-chunk. Solid,
hefty, and sounded very much like a Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a big car _ think midsize Honda or small Audi and
you've got it about right. The wagon, in fact, reminds me more of a
slightly larger version of a GT hatchback than a true wagon. Holds
four comfortably, can hold five, and has decent space behind the
back seats.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the 40s are rounded and sleek in a way that marks a
continuation of the departure (as evidenced in the C70 convertible
or the S80 sedan) away from the heavy box we knew and loved as the
old Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   Add the surprising midrange zip of its turbocharged,
four-cylinder engine, and you've got a veritable sprite emerging
from the cocoon of clunk.
</P>
<P>
   At the high end, the V40 will go up against wagons from Audi and
BMW; at the lower end, it has Hondas and Subarus in its sights.
</P>
<P>
   You get one choice of engine: a 1.9-liter, tubocharged, DOHC,
16-valve, inline four-cylinder, but it is plenty for a car this
size. Enough juice, in fact, that in a car this light, you ask
about safety.
</P>
<P>
   Safety?
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it's a Volvo. Front and side airbags are standard. They
react to the strength and angle of any impact. The front seats are
hinged and bracketed to move on impact and absorb its force, even
as the headrests move to cradle the head and prevent whiplash.
</P>
<P>
   Not all safety related, but also standard in the 40s are
air-conditioning, heated electric mirrors, a cassette-radio, power
windows, remote locks, cruise control, and ABS. You pay extra (in
this case up to almost $6,000 extra) for leather seats, sunroof,
power seats, and other amenities. Nice touches, but if you want a
truly cheap Volvo, you don't need them.
</P>
<P>
   With the leather package, there is a fine hint of luxury to the
car. Slip into the front seats and their support is sturdy, aided
by electric adjustment, particularly firming them up beneath the
thighs. Rear seat room is cramped for three adults and fine for
two, providing the front-seat passengers do not have to move their
seats way back.
</P>
<P>
   Gauges are organized efficiently along the dash: all light
switches to the left of the wheel, climate controls at top center,
audio below them. There is no searching for buttons or switches
once you familiarize yourself with the car. Between the front seats
you find the switch that lets you choose between summer and winter
driving conditions (part of an $850 weather package), the control
for the outside mirrors, and controls for the electric windows.
</P>
<P>
   The main instrument panel, arched like a single eyebrow, is
simple and easily read behind the wheel. A trip computer ($250)
warns of icing conditions, lets you preset your speed limit and
gives an audio warning when you exceed it, and provides current
fuel consumption rate, average fuel consumption, average speed,
ambient temperature, a trip meter, and miles to go before you run
out of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a car for large families _ a couple with two small
children or people with no children who like to go antiquing or
camping on weekends would find it perfect.
</P>
<P>
   The rear seats fold down in two sections, and the front
passenger seat folds for long loads. The 33.5 cubic feet of cargo
space behind the rear seats can be covered with a cargo net.
</P>
<P>
   Easily accessible storage space for small items is limited to
small bins in each door, a small bin between the seats and, if you
get the leather package, nifty pockets on the front of each front
seat.
</P>
<P>
   On the road, the V40 was quiet, quick, and nimble.
</P>
<P>
   It will not scream away from traffic lights and the
four-cylinder lags if you try to do this. But between around 1,900
and 4,700 rpms, the turbo kicks in and gives the car a strong surge
for passing. It's a perfect compromise for those who want the fuel
economy (just over 25 miles per gallon in this test) of a small
engine, but who don't want to be left out there hanging as they try
to pass a big truck in two-way traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Its four-wheel, independent suspension _ struts up front,
multilink suspension in the rear _ is a bit stiff on bumpy roads,
but gives the upside of sure-footedness in highway maneuvers and
firm cornering on tight country lanes.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Swedes might not want to hear this, it feels more
like a fine and tight Japanese car than the safe but plodding Volvo
of old.
</P>
<P>
   Four-wheel, 14-inch vacuum-assist disc brakes, aided by ABS, are
more than enough to bring the V40's 3,040 pounds, plus passengers,
to quick, straight stops.
</P>
<P>
   So is this a Volvo?
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely, though in the sense that even as you say that
towering Mark McGuire is a ballplayer, so too is the Red Sox
diminutive Donnie Sadler.
</P>
<P>
   Nice Touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The in-dash cup holder is the best I've seen. It adjusts to
the diameter of the can, cup, or bottle that is inserted into it.
What a concept!
</P>
<P>
   --The luggage belt in the rear compartment that pulls out like a
seat belt and wraps snugly around suitcases and other gear to hold
them in place.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The outside mirrors are too small _ I could see only the lower
half of the tires of big trucks coming up on me _ and given the
wide pillars that block much of the view to the rear, this is not a
good thing.
</P>
<P>
   --The speaker system could be better, especially the rear
speakers.
</P>
<P>

long-throw dimmer stick I've ever encountered.

HERE SHE IS, SINGLE AND CHILDLESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHTE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dee Dee, our all-purpose advice columnist, was thrilled to hear
that the Miss America pageant board of directors voted to extend
the eligibilty requirements to women who have been divorced or
pregnant, as long as they have no children.
</P>
<P>
   Now she hears the directors are reconsidering, because of
pressure from state pageant officials who are furious about the
changes.
</P>
<P>
   Dee Dee doesn't agree with those fogeys who say the proposed new
criteria would lower the high moral tone of the pageant. Nothing
can sully the event. It's almost a religious experience. In fact,
it actually may be a religious experience, given the frequency with
which contestants mention the Almighty.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, Dee Dee thinks the pageant should bend even further
and extend eligibilty to women of a certain age. After all, they
keep saying it's not a beauty contest. But enough about Dee Dee's
thwarted ambitions. She's here to clarify as only she can the mass
confusion that has broken out about the proposed new elegibility
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Dear Dee Dee: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I read that under the new guidelines, the Miss America pageant
would be open to women who've had abortions. Here's my question:
How did pageant officials know if contestants in previous years
hadn't?
</P>
<P>
   DUBIOUS, SNEEZEWEED, VT.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, participants were required to swear a solemn
oath and sign a contract stating that they had never been married
or pregnant. As I'm sure you know, a Miss America contestant would
never lie. The new rules, if adopted, do away with that
requirement, which, as Dee Dee sees it, has always been superfluous
due to the exemplary morals of all the contestants.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Dear Dee Dee:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under the new eligibility rules for Miss America, is there a
limit to the number of times you can have been married? I ask
because I have recently been divorced for the third time. I have
written a moving song about my marital history, which I perform
while simultaneously tap-dancing and playing the marimba. I figure
I'd be a cinch to win the talent segment.
</P>
<P>
   SINGLE AGAIN, SHEEPNOSE, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   As Dee Dee inteprets the new rules, there's no reason a
three-time loser like yourself can't enter the pageant, as long as
she exhibits the the requisite high moral character. Go for it.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dee Dee:
</P>
<P>
   I am enthusiastically male and have no current plans to undergo
a sex change. However, being Miss America has always been my secret
dream. Under the new rules will I be allowed to compete?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
GLEN OR GLENDA, WINESAP
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You may have been able to compete under the old rules, because
while aspirants were required to swear they'd never been married or
pregnant, they were not asked to swear they were female.
Personally, Dee Dee thinks it is very narrow-minded and sexist of
pageant officials not to allow men to participate. This is a
democracy. Every little girl, and every little boy too, should be
able to aspire to be Miss America.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Dear Dee Dee:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My husband is being very difficult about my plans to divorce him
so I can pursue my goal of becoming Miss America. I told him the
divorce is only temporary, but he stubbornly refuses to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   THWARTED, FEVERFEW, MAINE
</P>
<P>
   Dee Dee thinks you must ask yourself if you see any kind of
future with a man who is so selfish that he puts his marriage vows
ahead of your dream of becoming Miss Anerica, the noblest calling a
woman can aspire to.
</P>
<P>

WITH LATINO BOXERS, FANS THROW CULTURAL IDENTITY INTO THE RING 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   In this corner hovers Melissa Soto, a Chicana born in East LA
who now lives in Boston. Across the ring, er, room, is Soto's
boyfriend, Juan Figueroa, a proud Puerto Rican.
</P>
<P>
   The two began dating six months ago. Then Oscar De La Hoya and
Felix ``Tito'' Trinidad came between them.
</P>
<P>
   See, De La Hoya and Trinidad are welterweight boxers. And De La
Hoya is Mexican-American; Trinidad is Puerto Rican. On Saturday,
the 25-year-old hunks will climb into a Las Vegas boxing ring, both
undefeated and with 55 knockouts between them. Their highly
anticipated battle has caused rifts in the community of Latino
fight fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been going at it for five months about who's going to
kick whose ass,'' says Figueroa, 29. ``As a matter of fact, we
can't watch the fight together. If we do, that might be the end of
the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad, a skillful but little-known Puerto Rican boxer has
been enthusiastically embraced by his American countrymen. In past
interviews he's cockily promised that once the pair enter the ring,
De La Hoya ``will visit the canvas.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, who fought his way into America's heart by winning
the gold medal in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, is the darling of
the Chicano population. De La Hoya has heard the constant taunts
from Trinidad and he's all riled up: ``I haven't felt this way
since I fought (Julio Cesar) Chavez the first time,'' he told the
Houston Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   As two very distinct cultures duke it out in the ring, this
fight is Boricua vs. Chicano, East Coast vs. West Coast, salsa vs.
mariachi, rum vs. tequila. In preparation for the big day, Soto and
Figueroa come out arguing. Ding. Ding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxers shouldn't be pretty boys,'' says Figueroa of the
handsome De La Hoya, causing Soto to screech in dispair. ``Trinidad
has wanted to fight De La Hoya for the longest time. De La Hoya's a
corporation. He's been fighting people to make money. Now that he's
made all the money he can't run away from Trinidad anymore. His
time has come.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, actually, it's Soto's time. And she starts with an
apology, ``I'm sorry you had to talk to him first.''
</P>
<P>
   For Soto, De La Hoya is the local hero. She grew up in the same
East LA neighborhood as he did. She spouts the words ``role model''
and ``representative'' when she talks about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oscar was like the Latino fighter,'' says Soto, 23. ``Now this
fight is more than that because it's not just (one) Latino. Puerto
Ricans in New York and Boston can relate more to Trinidad. So, of
course, that's why they're more into him now.''
</P>
<P>
   For many fans, the upcoming fight is the most exciting boxing
battle in years. Think Muhammad Ali vs. George Foreman, Sugar Ray
Leonard vs. Marvin Hagler, and you get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of decades ago in boxing, the top fighters in any
division would wind up meeting each other within one or two years.
Now it takes forever,'' says Angelo Figueroa, editor of People En
Espanol in New York and a former amateur boxer.
</P>
<P>
   ``So there's a tremendous amount of excitement,'' Figueroa
continues. ``And of course even though we consider ourselves (all)
Latino, it allows us to engage in national (heritage) pride for a
day as well. So, believe you me, it does create a bit of a rivalry
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lilliam Rivera, entertainment editor for Latina Magazine in New
York has heard the ruckus. ``Puerto Ricans are like, `Yeah,
(Trinidad's) going to kick (De La Hoya's) butt and then Mexicans
are saying `Yeah, we're going to kick some butt.' It's really
scary,'' she laughs. ``The whole thing is funny because you think,
`We should all just get along.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The listeners of WNFT-AM (1150), the 24-hour Spanish-language
Mega Communications radio station in Boston, got along well enough
on a recent Thursday morning as they enthusiastically dissected the
fighters. Couched between advertisements, traffic information,
news, and a few merengue tunes, more than 30 people from aired
their views in the space of an hour.
</P>
<P>
   One Dominican said he thought De La Hoya would win, although the
caller had respect for Trinidad's skills. Another believed De La
Hoya would win with the help of his strong hook.
</P>
<P>
   A few callers said they thought De La Hoya was afraid to fight
Tito, as Trinidad is affectionately called. They believed De La
Hoya won a previous fight with Pernell Whitaker in a questionable
decision. Of course, the hecklers were Trinidad fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're saying De La Hoya lost,'' scoffs Maria Elena Verdugo,
station manager at Mega Communications in Charlestown, a
Mexican-American who had posters of De La Hoya decorating her
office when she worked in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have all of those fights and he didn't lose any,'' Verdugo
continues. ``Whitaker gave him a very close fight, but it wasn't
given to De La Hoya.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every Latino toes the expected line, however. On Thursday
morning, Alejandro Miguel, a Puerto Rican on-air personality, tells
the listeners he's supporting Trinidad because of his fighting
abilities _ not his nationality. And several Puerto Ricans call in
and place their hopes on De La Hoya. Many are women, which gets the
on-air staff a bit riled.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are choosing De La Hoya because he's pretty,'' says Mega
morning man Tony Ramia derisively, after one Puerto Rican woman
pledged her faith in De La Hoya's skills.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel scolds, ``It's the quality of the fighters, it's not
because he's Puerto Rican or pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a beauty contest,'' exclaims the third Mega morning
voice, Mega-Tonin Pimentel. But it is worth noting that these guys
_ all Puerto Ricans _ were chanting ``Tito! Tito! Tito!'' before
taking calls about the fight.
</P>
<P>
   That type of enthusiasm must be making people in Trinidad's camp
smile. For years Latinos have eagerly followed De La Hoya's
matches. He's got such a huge fan base that EMI Latin recently gave
the fighter a recording contract. Even Rivera, a passionate
Trinidad supporter, reluctantly reveals that she's seen most of De
La Hoya's fights. ``I have to represent,'' she says sheepishly.
</P>
<P>
   This battle gives Trinidad a taste of De La Hoya-size fame in
the United States, notes Verdugo, who even admits to being a
Trinidad fan _ when he's fighting anyone other than De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   But when two favorites enter the ring, nationality can be a
deciding factor, as one caller noted in Spanish during her recent
on-air moment (a staff member translated her comment): ``If I
wasn't Puerto Rican it would be a draw for me because they're both
so good. But I'm a Puerto Rican woman and I have to go with the
home team and stick with Tito.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course there's even a disagreement about which group is more
loyal to its heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexicans are a lot more passionate about their people than
Puerto Ricans,'' says George Mier, the Puerto Rican program
director at Mega Communications. ``Since we're part of the US we
tend to, you know, be more Americanized than anything. So we go
with whomever. It doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   But get Verdugo started on the subject, and she exclaims, ``I
think with the fans of Trinidad it's more a nationality thing than
looking at the quality of the fighters. Because Trinidad is good
but if you look at the type of fights Oscar did, his track record _
there's a reason why they call him the golden boy.''

<P>
   WEYMOUTH, Mass. _ To Jim Gallagher, a pigeon flier from
Weymouth, his birds are thoroughbred racers and sleek, muscular
messengers of the skies.
</P>
<P>
   He gives them names like Ace and Baron and Pursuit. He keeps 100
of them in plywood ``condominiums'' in his mother's backyard. On
weekends, he and other pigeon enthusiasts at the Weymouth
Sportsmen's Club race against a dozen other pigeon clubs in the
Boston area. He remembers the time one of his birds flew 600 miles
from Ohio in barely 14 hours, through high winds and brutal heat,
to get back home to him.
</P>
<P>
   But to Weymouth's public health agent, the pigeons are dirty,
hazardous creatures who should never be brought near a club where
members meet and eat hamburgers and hot dogs and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a health edict, the executive board of the
sportsmen's club decided last month to oust the birds and their
owners, some of whom have been members for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   In a flap that has bitterly divided the 75-year-old sports club,
its board on Aug. 26 evicted pigeons and pigeoneers, citing unpaid
bills, stolen property, and health concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Marino, Weymouth's director of public health, said he
concluded without inspecting the sportsmen's club that ``having
pigeons in a place where people meet and eat is categorically a
very bad idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Even clean pigeons can transmit salmonella and psittacosis, or
parrot fever, as well as bird lice, to humans. So he recommended
that the birds be kept outside the building, which is in a patch of
piney woods near the Braintree line.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, we're talking about a clubhouse, not a coop,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Animosities created by this health edict led the club's
executive board to terminate the membership of three pigeon
enthusiasts and suspend 27 more, said Daniel Affsa, a Weymouth
lawyer representing the board.
</P>
<P>
   The approximately 30 members of the club's pigeon committee are
outraged. They say the health charges have been trumped up to mask
an unethical power play by a few board members seeking to impose
their own, gun-oriented agenda on the membership.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bag job,'' said Peter Hultman, 52, Northeast regional
director of the American Racing Pigeon Union and one of the pigeon
enthusiasts whose membership has been terminated.
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized that pigeons are kept in the sportsmen's building
for only about 30 hours a year, when they are banded and inspected
before races, and when only other pigeoneers are present. Members
are fanatical about cleanliness and ``give them better care than a
lot of people ever get,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   These are not the winged pests that gather in city parks and
line the eves of buildings, annoyingly dropping excrement on cars
and passersby. They are silkier, smarter, bigger, and more muscular
than their urbanized counterparts, and bred to fly at speeds of
more than 70 miles per hour for up to 15 hours a day. ``They're the
thoroughbreds of the pigeon world,'' said Jim Swindler, 77, of
Braintree, who has raised homing pigeons since he was 11 years old.
</P>
<P>
   In the weekend pigeon races, each bird owner sends up to 15
pigeons, which are inspected and banded and transported to an
agreed racing site, 100 to 600 miles away. Then the birds are
released. Bands attached to their legs record when they reach home
on a time clock, and results are tabulated and compared.
</P>
<P>
   Pigeon handlers over the years have included King Solomon, Queen
Elizabeth II, Roy Rogers, and Walt Disney. Since the days of the
Roman Empire, pigeons have been used to carry messages through
enemy territory, and they had a distinquished record in World Wars
I and II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Allied bomber carried a pigeon, and if the plane went
down, they'd strap a message on the pigeon's wing with the map
coordinates, so rescuers could find them,'' said Swindler, who
served in the Army's 282d Signal Pigeon Corps in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, as he does on racing days, Swindler was sitting in a
rickety plastic lawn chair in his backyard, scanning the skies,
waiting for his pigeons to come home.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier that morning, a friend had trucked about 30 of his
beloved birds to Palmer, about 55 miles away, and released them _
secure in the knowledge that, no matter what happened, they would
try to fly home.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the pigeons swooped down and landed on his rooftop.
And Swindler was all smiles as they cooed and chortled to their
mates and hopped back into his backyard coops.
</P>
<P>
   The homing pigeon's loyalty and proud history make the current
conflict all the more painful to the pigeoneers. They think the
birds are being blamed in a battle that is really about something
else.
</P>
<P>
   What precipitated the current controversy, they say, was the
defeat of a motion to change the requirement for sports club voting
privileges from five to two year's prior membership. Most of the
pigeoneers are longtime members, while gun owners are relative
newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher added that the eviction feels especially egregious to
pigeoneers because about 25 years ago, when the sportsmen's club
was in dire financial straits, the pigeon people held raffles and
potluck dinners, donated property, and provided plumbing and other
services to fix up the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very personal stake in that building,'' he said. As
he spoke, some of his pigeons circled overhead, taking their
afternoon exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Hultman also said many of the pigeon handlers are deeply
offended by charges that they stole club property _ when they were
merely removing their own tables and chairs after they were ordered
out of the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's trying to throw out the pigeon people,'' said Affsa,
the lawyer, who said the charges of stolen property and unpaid
bills ``may have been inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, he said the executive board's decision must be
approved by a two-thirds vote at a membership meeting Sept. 29. At
that time, most of the pigeoneers ``probably will be welcomed back
into the club,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A welcoming spirit was not in evidence at an executive board
meeting Tuesday night, however, when officers locked their doors
and refused to discuss differences with Hultman.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a parent corrects a child, sometimes the child cries,''
executive board member Donald Hunt, a former Weymouth selectman,
told a reporter earlier that day. ``Don't you know how children
are?'' he asked. ``They whine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They never talk to us as men,'' Hultman countered. ``We
respect their pistol-shooting hobby. But they don't respect our
sport at all.''

 By PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Jeffrey Miller, 34, marched into the grand
showroom at Microcenter recently with a shopping list: He wanted a
personal computer, a monitor, and some software. And when he was
approached by a salesman, Miller got right to the point about
price: ``I have $500 in my pocket. Point me in the right
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   If you had demanded that price from a salesman a year ago, it
probably would have provoked eye-rolling laughter. But these days,
with PC makers slashing prices, Internet providers offering $400
rebates on computers, and some stores promoting ``free'' PCs, savvy
shoppers are feeling entitled to bargain prices.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, 1999 purchases are up and low-priced computers make
up a far greater share of them. Many PC makers apparently came to
the conclusion early this year that they had to woo the low-end
buyer. Corporations and businesses did not seem to be investing
heavily in new upgrades, perhaps worrying more about getting past
the Y2K issue, and many people who already had PCs felt their
models were good enough for now.
</P>
<P>
   So vendors turned their attention to price-sensitive consumers
who could not manage the $1,000-plus hurdle in buying computer
equipment. First-time buyers are the overwhelming majority of
people taking advantage of PCs at cut-rate prices. These
bargain-hunting buyers include families with young children,
workers with yearly incomes below $30,000, and college students.
Others are seeking a cheap second computer for their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumer markets are growing much more than the corporate
market,'' said Stephen Baker, senior analyst for PC Data.
</P>
<P>
   Sales numbers show it. Of all desktop personal computers sold in
July, 36 percent cost less than $600, compared to 3 percent in that
price range in July of last year, according to PC Data, a market
research firm in Reston, Va.
</P>
<P>
   And 76 percent of the personal computers purchased in July sold
for under $1,000, compared to 50 percent the previous July.
</P>
<P>
   These bargain PCs have helped fuel a record-high volume in
computer sales this year. Unit sales are up 28 percent compared to
1998 sales.
</P>
<P>
   This banner year for price-conscious customers is occurring as
several major new and established companies compete aggressively in
this market. The deals are found at retail stores, as well as
through mail-order programs. One of the most popular promotions,
which became more widespread during the back-to-school rush and is
expected to continue through the holidays, is the $400 rebate on
computers from some Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   Computer industry analysts say the cut-rate computers may help
push down prices throughout the industry, including prices of
higher-performance computer models. Analysts say the cut-rate trend
is certain to help bring closer the day when PCs become standard
appliances in nearly all American homes, which some predict could
happen in a couple of years. Currently, about half of households in
the country own a personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're tapping into a market of people who wouldn't have bought
before,'' said John Brown, research manager for the Framingham,
Mass.-based International Data Corp. ``They may have thought they
didn't need one. But now, if it's cheap enough, why not?''
</P>
<P>
   Aliya and Ahsen Khan, a newly married couple in Somerville, have
established a $700 budget to purchase their first computer,
monitor, and printer. As recent college graduates on a limited
buget, they need every price break they can get and the low
computer prices allow them to consider some extras, such as a fax
machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great that the market is coming down,'' said Ahsen Khan,
23, while price-shopping at Best Buy in Cambridge last week.
</P>
<P>
   The one catch with the hefty rebate offers is that customers
have to sign up for a three-year binding contract with the Internet
provider, which costs about $20 a month. But the $400 rebate goes a
long way, especially if a buyer chooses a low-end $400 computer
model. That, arguably, makes the computer ``free.''
</P>
<P>
   Another road to a ``free'' computer is provided by Free-PC.com
of Pasadena, Calif. This year it offered 10,000 free computers to
customers willing to watch constant on-screen advertising, but
buyers have to meet certain requirements, including being rich
enough to buy what the company promotes.
</P>
<P>
   The $400 rebate programs, offered primarily by Prodigy,
CompuServe, and Microsoft Network, have some risks. Consumers must
abide by the three-year agreement, although during that time,
Internet fees may plummet or other options, such as Internet cable
access, may become more popular. Early-termination fees are hefty,
sometimes up to the full cost of the remainder of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, some buyers like the rebate program because they
figure that, for now, they would be paying monthly Internet fees
anyway. And the $400 rebate generally can be applied to any model
in the store, whether low or high end.
</P>
<P>
   The low-end models, which are from new companies such as
eMachines as well as established players like Compaq and
Hewlett-Packard, are generally good for most of what people need.
The PCs offer word-processing functions, access to the Internet,
and the ability to play basic games.
</P>
<P>
   But consumers should beware of the warranty protections. Many
low-end makers require customers to send in the machine to an
out-of-state site for repairs. On the other hand, a model that
costs just a few hundred dollars more might be covered for repairs
at the local store where it is bought. A slightly more expensive
model may also provide faster speed, crisper graphics, and the
ability to play more sophisticated games.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Burkett, retail sales manager at Microcenter in Cambridge,
said he has found that most buyers interested in the bargain or
``free'' computers are young families and working-class people who
could never afford a $1,000-plus investment for a computer, plus
monthly Internet access. Most first-time buyers cite the Internet
as a primary reason for buying a computer.
</P>
<P>
   With rebates, these consumers can pay next to nothing for their
startup equipment. And many of these customers are used to living
from paycheck to paycheck, he said, so the monthly Internet-access
fees fit into the way they think about budgets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think in terms of monthly bills, just as they might auto
insurance,'' he said. ``And now, they just have to figure out
whether they can put $20 more a month in their budget.''

THREE WOMEN AT SUMMIT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ Never before has a state government been led
entirely by women _ until now.
</P>
<P>
   The Granite State, long a bastion of Yankee tradition and
political conservatism, now has a woman governor, House speaker and
Senate president. It's something of an historic moment _ not that
any of the three women is particularly excited about it.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker, Republican Donna Sytek, shrugs and calls it ``a
historical footnote.'' The Senate president, Democrat Beverly A.
Hollingworth, similarly attaches no great significance to the
milestone, pointing out New Hampshire has long had many women in
its Legislature. ``It's something to be expected,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Shaheen, the two-term Democratic governor, is only
slightly more enthusiastic. ``For years, nobody thought anything of
having three men in these positions,'' she said. ``Now, it sends a
subtle message that that's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   But scholars who study state government sense that something
important could grow out of what has happened here. The New
Hampshire example could encourage more women to run for public
office, bringing more gender balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There won't be a woman president until enough women are
considered viable candidates and put themselves up for candidacy,''
said Cindy Simon Rosenthal, a political science professor at the
University of Oklahoma and the author of ``When Women Lead,'' a
book about the leadership style of women politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal argues that women politicians tend to be less
aggressive and more collaborative in their leadership styles. They
like to listen and talk things out, rather than force a vote. They
aim for solutions that create more winners than losers. And they
tend to concentrate more on issues that affect women and children,
such as education. But she acknowledged, also, that not all issues
can be solved by consensus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some problems don't lend themselves to discussion and
collaboration and sometimes you just have to bite the bullet,''
Rosenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire leaders know all about that.
</P>
<P>
   The question that hangs over their heads is whether they can
break the gridlock that brought the House, Senate and executive
branch to a standstill for much of this year. A statewide property
tax to relieve the education funding crisis resulted in a $100
million budget shortfall, and lawmakers have bitterly disagreed
over how to close the gap.
</P>
<P>
   Sytek wants to cut the state budget to eliminate the $100
million deficit. Shaheen would like to institute a capital gains
tax and to legalize video poker at the state's racetracks.
Hollingworth, meanwhile, vigorously opposes gambling and would
prefer an income tax.
</P>
<P>
   Sytek is pessimistic that a consensus is more likely, just
because Hollingsworth has succeeded the late Clesson ``Junie''
Blaisdell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things haven't changed since Junie died. People haven't
changed their positions,'' Sytek said. ``So we're facing the same
intractable problems we faced when we went into recess with a
different president of the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   She pointed out that Hollingworth was elected by the same
coalition of Democrats and Republicans who elected Blaisdell.
``It's not a dramatic change,'' Sytek said. ``The Senate president
will wear more colorful clothes now.''
</P>
<P>
   That three women would rise to leadership in New Hampshire was
not entirely unexpected. New Hampshire has always fielded a
volunteer legislature, the largest in the nation. State
representatives and senators earn $100 a year, to help defray their
expenses. That means that the two chambers have been made up of
retirees with time on their hands, people who are independently
wealthy, and many women whose husbands are the family breadwinners.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Center for the American Woman and Politics at
Rutgers University, the Granite State has the nation's sixth
highest percentage of women lawmakers at 31.6 percent. Washington
state is first with 40.8 percent, and Alabama is last with 7.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Pound, the executive director of the National Conference of
State Legislatures, said women are gaining seats in the
legislatures at a rate of about 1 percent a year. Currently, the
average percentage of women elected to state government is 22
percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Shaheen, Sytek and Hollingworth, the rise to power came
after years in the Legislature. Shaheen, 52, was first elected to
the state Senate in 1990 from Madbury. Sytek, 54, was elected to
the House from Salem in 1977, during a special election. And
Hollingworth represented Hampton in the House and now the Senate
for the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Hollingworth ran a seasonal business, a beach motel that allowed
her to participate in the legislature the rest of the year.
Shaheen's husband worked as a lawyer and a judge, giving her the
financial flexibility to get involved in politics. And until
Sytek's daughter was ready to go off to college, her family was
able to make do on just her husband's salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although this has a great deal of honor to be here, this is a
low-paying job,'' said Hollingworth, who got a raise from $100 to
$125 a year for winning the Senate presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Why do they stick with it?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all interested in seeing the state run as efficiently
and as well as possible,'' said Shaheen. ``Obviously, that doesn't
mean our philosophical differences will go away just because all of
a sudden there are three women in these positions.''

DODGERS ANNOUNCER BRINGS LOVE OF GAME TO LISTENERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He has been at it for 50 years, beginning in
Brooklyn as a wet-behind-the-ears 21-year-old hoping just to get
through a game without making a mistake. He has enjoyed the days of
Robinson and Campanella, Koufax and Drysdale, reveled in
Fernandomania and marveled at Kirk Gibson's World Series heroics.
He has also endured the inevitable troughs, including this dismal
Dodger season, a year that most diehard fans would like to strike
from the books, not to mention their memories.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Dodger broadcaster Vin Scully has maintained a
passion for baseball that transcends the standings, the players
and, yes, the ownership. He still gets goose bumps, still feels the
butterflies, still likes nothing more than seeing a 6-4-3 double
play turned with agility and precision.
</P>
<P>
   Vin Scully still has a tremendous love for the game.
</P>
<P>
   So when it came time to find a broadcaster to call the pivotal
contest in his new baseball movie, ``For Love of the Game,'' Kevin
Costner turned to Hall of Famer Scully, the only man he could see _
and hear _ in the booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one personifies the movie's title more than Vin,'' Costner
says. ``He has been the voice of baseball for as long as I can
remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds the film's director (and devoted baseball fan) Sam Raimi:
``You can't help but fall in love with the guy. You trust Vin
completely because he gives you a little piece of his heart every
night. You know you can believe him. You feel like he's family,
he's so familiar. In fact, there's no one I'd rather have tell me
some bad news than Vin Scully.''
</P>
<P>
   Scully has delivered more than his share of bad news to Dodger
fans this season. Tom Hanks may have famously said in ``A League of
Their Own'' that there's no crying in baseball, but Scully knows
that's simply not true. He has seen ball players cry and he knows
all the signs of sadness _ the haunted looks, the dark circles
under the eyes, the slumped figures at the lockers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember in 1982, Terry Forster giving up the home run to
Joe Morgan on the last game of the season,'' Scully says of a game
that cost the Dodgers the division title. ``And that hit just
ruined him. It broke his heart. Terry was a big, emotional,
warm-hearted guy and it just crushed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, another victim (Tom Niedenfuer, who gave up a
series-ending homer to St. Louis Cardinal slugger Jack Clark),
another Dodger season ending in tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Dodger manager) Tommy (Lasorda) was devastated by that,''
Scully says. ``So don't let anyone tell you there's no crying in
baseball, especially this time of year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For Love of the Game'' has its share of tears, too, but not
when Scully is on the screen. Scully plays himself, naturally
(``It's about as much of an acting stretch as I'm capable of,'' he
says with a wink), broadcasting a perfect game being thrown by an
aging Detroit Tigers pitcher, Billy Chapel, portrayed by Costner.
Scully was given a script, but was allowed to improvise. And
improvise he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came up with 80 percent of his lines,'' Raimi says. ``I
thought the screenwriter (Dana Stevens) might be upset, but she
thought it was fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Scully delivers the best line in the movie, an
end-of-the-game description so vivid and so perfect that long-time
listeners will realize that it could have only come from him.
Scully, modest to a fault, owns up to the authorship, but says ``it
wasn't much.'' After all, since he knew the outcome of the movie's
fictional game, he had time to think about what he was going to say
beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like a real game where I'm bobbing and weaving,''
Scully says.
</P>
<P>
   Pure Vin. And that's why most Dodger boosters love Scully more
than any of the players he chronicles. (The fans in the mid-'70s
named him the most memorable personality in L.A. Dodger history.)
With Scully, what you hear is what you get. The warmth, the humor,
the unaffected elegance often stand in stark contrast to the remote
haughtiness of so many modern-day athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Scully believes himself to be ``just a very ordinary man,''
which is a rather extraordinary statement coming from someone most
people believe to be the voice of baseball, not to mention the
voice of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   He has always been a straight shooter, calling the games ``right
down the middle'' without favoritism. But Scully is also an
optimist and prefers to celebrate the good than dwell on the
disappointing. So when he's asked about a perceived lack of love
for the game on the part of the modern-day player, Scully demurs.
He doesn't want to make any broad generalizations. And then,
typically, he launches into a story that restores your faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played Florida the other night and they brought in a relief
pitcher who, at one time, was in our organization, Dennis
Springer,'' Scully says. ``And Dennis Springer can't possibly be
making a lot of money; he hasn't been that successful. But he spent
eight years in the minor leagues. That's love. Rattling around in
buses, eating on the run, playing for peanuts ... and apparently he
never wavered, but just kept plugging away.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there are several players like that on every team who are
not superbly gifted but keep at it, keep following their dream.
That's a hard life. But they do it because they love the game, they
really do.''
</P>
<P>
   Scully doesn't broadcast every Dodger game these days. He takes
a few nights off a season, usually skipping games at the end of
long, grinding road trips. He no longer broadcasts the World Series
on the CBS radio network, either, preferring to spend the time with
his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most precious thing in the world is time,'' Scully says.
``And I like to spend as much as I can with those I love.''
</P>
<P>
   He prefers reading to movies, but sings the praises of past
baseball efforts like ``The Natural,'' ``The Pride of the Yankees''
and ``Field of Dreams.'' But, staying true to form, his strongest
memory connected with those films comes not from the movies
themselves, but from a baseball game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was doing the World Series with NBC in 1988 and the night
after Kirk Gibson hit the most memorable home run in Southern
California history, they married the Gibson home run to the one
Robert Redford hit at the end of `The Natural.' And, oh my, it gave
me goose bumps.''
</P>
<P>
   His contract with the Dodgers calls for two more seasons, and
Scully believes he will continue after that ``if'' _ and here he
goes again _ ``the Fox ownership wants me to continue.'' (Can you
imagine the headlines if they didn't?) The decision for him, he
says, is really a no-brainer. Why should he _ health permitting _
stop doing something he loves?
</P>
<P>
   ``And it doesn't matter if the team is in first place or 20
games out,'' Scully says. ``I learned that basic lesson after Sandy
Koufax and Don Drysdale left and the team hit the skids. I can't
think about the standings. If I just come to the ballpark and think
about  &UR; !ital! &LR; the game &UR; !off! &LR; , I'll enjoy it immensely. Immensely.
And, therefore, I still get excited and I still get emotional
because I don't have that voice saying, `So what?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides,'' Scully adds, ``it's such a good game. The cast of
characters can change, ownerships can change, ballparks can change,
but  &UR; !ital! &LR; the game &UR; !off! &LR;  is so good.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly when it's one called by Vin Scully. &UR;  &QL;

DEALING WITH DAWDLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As parents, we all know that our patience will be tried. So you
may not be surprised to find yourself standing at the bottom of the
stairs, with five minutes to go before the school bus arrives,
shouting to your third-grader that she will be grounded for life if
she doesn't get downstairs this minute. But then it gets worse:
When she doesn't answer, you climb the stairs with your fury barely
in check, only to find her quietly playing with her Beanie Babies,
oblivious to time, the school bus, or you.
</P>
<P>
   This is dawdling at its best.
</P>
<P>
   As frustrating as it can be when children don't do what they
need to do when they need to do it, procrastination is a phenomenon
of childhood that won't go away. We can't eliminate it, but we can
keep it from getting out of hand. Unfortunately, we often
inadvertently make it worse instead of better.
</P>
<P>
   The first way we get into trouble is expecting children to have
the same sense of time as we do.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they are engrossed in something, they have no sense of
time passing,'' says psychologist Lenora Yuen of Palo Alto, Calif.
That accounts for why a preschooler doesn't put toys away when you
tell her to, why a 12-year-old doesn't see what the big deal is
that he hasn't taken the garbage out yet, or why a third-grader
gets sidetracked by her Beanie Babies.
</P>
<P>
   Most effective, she says, are gentle reminders _ ``Five minutes
until we leave!'' ``Dinner is in 20 minutes; did you remember it's
your turn to set the table?'' ``What can I do to help you remember
. .?'' _ even though you have to issue them day after day. Yuen is
a coauthor of ``Procrastination: Why You Do It, What to Do About
It'' (Addison Wesley).
</P>
<P>
   Some children are more prone to dawdling by nature. ``They're
kids who move at a slower pace, are slow to warm up to new people,
have a hard time making transitions, and are easily distracted,''
says pediatrician William Coleman, an associate professor at the
University of North Carolina. The more we beg, nag, and threaten,
the more they tune us out, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Children of all ages and temperaments also procrastinate for a
slew of other reasons, from practical to psychological:
</P>
<P>
   --He's overwhelmed. When Yuen researched her book, she was
surprised to have adults pinpoint when their procrastination
started: second grade. That turns out to be typical. ``It's in
second grade that you have your first assignment to do a report,
and it's scary,'' says Yuen. The job is so daunting _ How do I
begin? How do I make it good? _ that it's easier not to start at
all. This child needs organizational help. Break the task into
small pieces: ``Let's start with one sentence about your favorite
person in the book.''
</P>
<P>
   Being overwhelmed can also come from having too many activities
or too much responsibility, or from parental expectations that are
too high.
</P>
<P>
   ``For overprogrammed kids, the only way to get downtime is to
dawdle,'' says behavioral pediatrician David W. Willis of Portland,
Ore. If you think this is what's going on, ask: ``I wonder if you
feel like you don't have enough time to just play?'' Willis and
Coleman are contributing editors to the American Academy of
Pediatrics' book ``Caring for Your School-Age Child, 5 to 12.''
</P>
<P>
   Chores and responsibilities can cause dawdling if they are
inappropriate. ``There's a tendency today to think the 9-, 10-, or
11-year-old is more independent than he really is,'' Willis says.
``The solution for a child who's stressed and confused from being
asked to do more than he's developmentally capable of is to avoid
it by dawdling.'' He tells parents to be sure expectations are
appropriate; to talk to a child about his responsibilities; and to
provide structure, feedback, and praise.
</P>
<P>
   --She doesn't want to fail. This is the most prevalent motive
behind procrastination, according to child psychologist Joseph
Ferrari of De Paul University in Chicago. ``A child would rather
have other people look at her as lacking effort than lacking
ability,'' he says. She may turn to dawdling if she perceives
herself as always succeeding _ ``What if I can't keep it up?'' _ or
always failing: ``If I never do this, no one can see how badly I do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yuen says many procrastinators are perfectionists, even in
second grade: ``They want every single letter they form to be
perfect. That takes a lot of effort; they get frustrated and put
off doing it.'' She urges parents to be coaches: ``The mantra is,
`It doesn't have to be perfect,' because the psychological task for
this child is to learn to be forgiving of himself.''
</P>
<P>
   --He doesn't want to succeed. In a scenario that's common in
fourth grade and above, a child may worry that peers will ostracize
him if he's too smart. So he turns a paper in late and gets a B
instead of an A. Or he worries about outshining an older, less
successful sibling and dawdles as a way to diminish himself. Yuen
suggests posing questions to get a conversation going: ``I bet some
kids who are really smart worry about what their friends think of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   --She's angry. A child may purposefully procrastinate as a way
to get back at you for something, says child psychologist Edward
Zigler, Sterling professor of psychology at Yale University. Get to
the heart of the issue _ ``I can tell you're angry at me; let's
talk'' _ before you focus on the dawdling. Dawdling that's fueled
by resentment may not always be tied to something specific,
however. Ferrari's research shows that a father who is highly
impersonal, cold, and stern is most likely to have a child who
dawdles. ``It's one of the few ways he can really annoy you,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   --He wants to be in control. The reason we so commonly end up in
a power struggle over procrastination is because he wants to be in
control of when he does what he has to do. Sometimes it makes the
most sense to facilitate that, says Yuen, as long as you establish
limits and consequences and follow through with them: ``It doesn't
matter when you do your chores, as long as they're done before
dinner at 6. Otherwise, you won't be able to ride your bike after
dinner.'' When we don't follow through, we reinforce dawdling: ``It
doesn't matter if I don't do this now; Mom doesn't care.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the motive for procrastination, researchers
agree, we also reinforce it when we continually rescue a child.
Preschoolers, for instance, says Zigler, engage in a kind of
magical thinking: `` `If I don't clean up my toys, it will just get
done,' as if there's a good fairy. If we do the task, we're the
good fairy.'' He suggests being explicit: ``The good fairy won't do
this. I'll help you with it today but this is your job.''
</P>
<P>
   Yuen, who frequently sees adults who never suffered the
consequences of procrastinating until they got a job, says children
need to learn not only that procrastination can hurt them _ a
lesser grade, a reputation for being irresponsible _ but also that
it is rude and disrespectful to others. The ultimate goal is for a
child to learn how to manage time and meet external expectations in
a conscious, responsible way. ``What parents don't realize,'' says
Willis, ``is that this takes years and years to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Yuen's favorite strategy is a time-trade, where a child pays you
back in time or effort for the inconvenience he causes: ``When you
don't take the garbage out in a timely way, the kitchen starts to
smell. Every time that happens, it's an inconvenience and annoyance
to me. The consequence is for you to owe me 20 minutes of extra
chores.'' Or: ``I have to leave the house at 7:30 to drop you at
school and get to work on time. For every minute your dawdling
makes us leave late, you owe me that minute in extra chore time.''
</P>
<P>
   Willis recomends joining a child in the chore as a guide. As
you're working side by side, not only can you tell if he's
overwhelmed and thus scale the job back, but you can also model how
to do it successfully. For instance, if he has to clean his room
and doesn't know where to start, you can help him see that
everything doesn't have to be done at once: ``We'll set the timer
for 15 minutes and see what we can do in that time; then we can
come back later and do more.''
</P>
<P>
   Although children can dawdle at any time of the day over any
responsibility, morning is prime time. ``They have a hard time
working up the momentum to get moving,'' says Yuen.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, she found herself struggling with her dawdling
7-year-old, who was late for school despite her best efforts. What
finally worked didn't come from her but from the teacher: The
tardiness was reported on the report card.
</P>
<P>
   Yuen is betting that morning dawdling won't be a problem this
year.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --It's normal for procrastination to be typically sporadic,
sometimes occurring at the same time each day (a likely sign of
fatigue, hunger, or body rhythm) or around a particular issue (a
sign he's overwhelmed).
</P>
<P>
   --Consider it a red flag if you're nagging about dawdling all
day long about many different things; if you're hearing about it
from the teacher and the coach; and if it's also accompanied by
moodiness and irritability. These may be signs of depression.
</P>
<P>
   --Children with a risk-taking personality may leave things until
the last minute for the thrill of completing it under the wire. If
the effort is successful, there's a rush: ``Whoa, am I good!'' If
it fails: ``Hey, I didn't have enough time.''
</P>
<P>
   --Children who procrastinate over social decisions _ ``Should I
go to the sleep-over or not?'' _ will blame you if you make the
decision for them: ``I had a terrible time, and it's your fault!''
Help them instead to take ownership: What are the reasons not to
go? What are the reasons to go?
</P>
<P>
   --The more you battle over dawdling, the more the battle becomes
part of the routine. Break the cycle by changing the pattern with
either more guidance or more structure.
</P>
<P>
   --Reward systems such as star charts can help preschoolers and
school-age children be more timely.
</P>
<P>
   --Teenagers tend to procrastinate most at the beginning of a
relationship. Afraid they'll lose the friendship, they put off
responsibilities in order to spend more time with the person.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AFTERTHOUGHT: In an hour of children's television programming, a
child also typically watches 24 commercials.

AMMONIA AND WATER COULD CLEAN BLEACH STAIN ON GLASS

   Q. I cleaned old siding with bleach and TSP, but spilled some on

   A. If you have not tried anything, a strong solution of ammonia
and water may do it. If not, it means the TSP and/or the bleach,
but more likely the TSP, may have etched the glass; cleaning
products like Fantastic, for instance, can etch glass.

   First, try washing the glass with vinegar. If no go, try Du
Pont's rubbing compound, or Never Dull Magic Wadding, sold in some
hardware stores. Finally, try washing with Zud or Lime-Away, sold
in supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Try these suggestions one at a time, and do not combine any of
them.
</P>

   Q. I installed 6 inches of fiberglass insulation in a crawl
space ceiling where the crawl space was 4 feet from ground to
joists. That was easy. In an area where the joists are just 6
inches above the ground, I took up the floor and put down 6-inch
fiberlgass with the paper vapor barrier stapled to the tops of the
joists. That was easy, too, but after I put the floorboards back
down, I realized that I did not put poly on the ground under those
joists, to keep water vapor from migrating up through the earth and
into that space, where it could cause decay. Is it really necessary
to put the poly on the ground? I am not happy at the prospect of
ripping everything out and putting it back after I put down the
poly.
</P>
<P>
   RICHARD BODURTHA, Plymouth, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well . . . let's put it this way: You were concerned enough
about it to call the handyman, and you will continue to be
concerned no matter what the handyman says. Therefore, you will not
be happy until you install the poly, as odious as the work is.
</P>
<P>
   So that is what I suggest. If you leave it as is, you run the
risk of water vapor getting in that space and rotting out the
joists, a distinct possibility. Ventilating that space is difficult
and iffy because it is so shallow. If the space opens into the
basement or a crawl space, and the basement or crawl space is
ventilated, it should take care of air flow in that restricted
area.
</P>
<P>
   So, bite the bullet, throw down the gauntlet, grit your teeth,
and do it. You will be glad you did.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am looking for an adhesive to bond vinyl to concrete. I
have some vinyl treads I'd like to glue onto concrete steps. I
tried a kind of contact cement that did not work.
</P>
<P>
   EDWARD McKENNA, Norwood, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Contact cement was not the thing to use, as you found out. It
is unlikely to stick to either material. But you can try an
adhesive caulk. One type is called Pheno-Seal, and it should work
with the vinyl tread because it is a phenolic-vinyl caulk. It also
should work on concrete. The caulk comes in a caulking cartridge,
so it is an easy matter to apply the material from a caulking gun.
Apply several beads of the caulk on the concrete where the tread
will go, then press the tread in place, so that the tread flattens
those beads. I don't think there is any need to put a weight on the
treads, but it won't hurt. Let the adhesive caulk set overnight. Be
sure to apply a bead of caulk at the perimeter of the tread to keep
out water.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. When I had my chimneys swept, the chimney sweep could not get
his brush through one of the flues. Then he discovered a stovepipe
going crossways through the chimney and blocking most of it. The
pipe was for an old kitchen stove, now long gone, and the opening
in the chimney was covered. The blockage does not seem to be
affecting the gas-fired hot water heater. Should that pipe come
out? I'd hate to have to break into the wall again. The sweeps
found no deterioration in the masonry but recommended I install
flue liners.
</P>
<P>
   M.D., Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It's a shame you have to break into the wall, but that is the
only way you will get the pipe out, and I think it should be
removed because it is blocking two-thirds of the flue. Once it is
removed, you have to brick up the opening in the chimney with brick
and mortar. Then you can fix the hole in the wall that you made to
get the pipe out.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, you can do this yourself, and save a bundle.
</P>
<P>
   As for installing new flue liners, it is not only a good idea
but may be required, because both flues are serving gas burners.
Burning gas creates a lot of water vapor, which, if it condenses in
the chimney, combines with soot and other fire byproducts to form
an acid that will degrade the bricks or clay flue liners of the
chimney. A stainless steel or aluminum flue liner will prevent
this.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The treads of my outside brick stairway have lost mortar, and
I am reluctant to take them apart to repoint. Do I need a bonding
agent for this work?
</P>
<P>
   JIM SEE, Wakefield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Good news. You don't need a bonding agent when you repoint,
and you don't have to take apart the steps, either. You only have
to chip out the old mortar to 3/4-inch deep and as wide as the
joint, and press in new mortar. You don't have to chip out mortar
where the mortar is sound. Buy Sakrete Mortar Mix at a building
store, add water to make a crumbly, not soupy, mix, and press it in
the joint. Press heavily; weakly applied mortar will fail quickly.
A bonding agent is necessary when a thin layer of concrete is
applied over an old layer, such as a floor, patio, driveway, walk,
or even a vertical wall.

`JAKOB'S' LEADER: ROBIN WILLIAMS FINDS LAUGHTER IN HELL

entertainment column)

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Robin Williams
in ``Jakob the Liar.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Last year, ``Life Is Beautiful'' proved that there's no place so
grim that laughter can't be found there _ not even a Nazi
concentration camp.
 &HT;    Now, a year after Italian writer/director/star Roberto Benigni
became Hollywood's latest darling by masterfully mixing tears and
laughs in a Holocaust setting, Robin Williams _ considered by many
to be America's funniest man _ is out to prove that there's more
where that came from.
 &HT;    Don't assume that Williams is trying to cash in on Benigni's
success, or that his new film, ``Jakob the Liar,'' isn't the
biggest risk of his career. Williams had already begun shooting
``Jakob'' in Hungary and Poland by the time ``Life Is Beautiful''
exploded at the box office, and he'd committed to the film at a
time when the blending of humor and the Holocaust was anything but
money in the bank.
 &HT;    The actor admits that at first he was edgy about tackling the
tragicomic novel by Polish-born Jurek Becker, who spent much of his
youth in the Lodz ghetto and wrote his book while living in East
Germany. It has been filmed before, incidentally _ a
German-language adaptation won a Silver Bear award at the 1974
Berlin Film Festival.
 &HT;    The current film, which will open on Sept. 24, co-stars Alan
Arkin, Bob Balaban, Michael Jeter, Armin Mueller-Stahl and Nina
Siemaszko. Set in 1944 in a Nazi ghetto somewhere in Poland, it
casts Williams as Jakob Heym, who almost despite himself ends up
passing on encouraging radio reports to his friends in the ghetto _
news of German losses and the approaching end of the war which is,
unfortunately, entirely fictitious.
 &HT;    ``He keeps making up stuff to keep it going because people
become really dependent on it,'' Williams says. ``He has a vivid
imagination, fabricating news of German defeats, American
intervention mixed with tall tales of Benny Goodman and the Andrews
Sisters showing up to entertain the advancing allies.
 &HT;    ``Of course he doesn't have a radio,'' Williams adds, ``and he
risks arrest and certain death by spinning these tales. His stories
are lies, but they keep hope and humor alive, and the suicides in
the ghetto stop so long as he keeps inventing good news.''
 &HT;    The actor's wife, Marsha Garces Williams, is one of the film's
producers. She was the one who first read the novel and thought of
Jakob as a perfect role for Williams. She showed him the book, and
both were moved by the story, and particularly by the way the
ghetto dwellers managed to carry on despite the atrocities playing
out around them.
 &HT;    ``Humor was an important part of them going on,'' Williams says.
``It's weird to think of people still having a sense of humor in
the face of that, but they did.
 &HT;    ``Even the Holocaust survivors who read the script said, `Don't
be afraid of it, because that existed,''' he says. ``Despite
suicides and shootings, they would still have concerts and
productions. As a species, there's a kind of gallows humor that we
know exists.
 &HT;    ``Do I get afraid of it? A little bit,'' he admits. ``Will I
fail sometimes with it? Will it be in bad taste? Occasionally. But
I know people in the most extraordinarily horrific situations will
still have moments of comedy. It's that somehow-surviving vestige
of humanity that keeps you going in the face of atrocity.''
 &HT;    The question of balance was pivotal to the script, he says.
Becker's novel goes back and forth between humor and tragedy, with
brutal scenes of Nazi violence placed cheek-by-jowl with ordinary
scenes of everyday life in the ghetto.
 &HT;    ``There is a sense of sadness to Jakob,'' Williams says. ``He's
lost his wife. He's gone through a lot of different things, and yet
he still carries on _ he's still a survivor.''
 &HT;    At the beginning of the story, Williams says, Jakob doesn't even
see himself as Jewish.
 &HT;    ``He says, `I'm not, I don't light the candles on Shabbat,'''
the actor explains. ``But to the Gestapo, he's the biggest Jew
there ever was. He thought of himself always as Polish, and then
he's forced to be here. In a weird way, he finds out how Jewish he
really is.''
 &HT;    It's a particularly challenging role, one unlike any Williams
has done before. But that in itself isn't too unusual for an actor
who began as a standup comedian and has since refused to be
pigeonholed, establishing himself in everything from the zany
comedy of ``Good Morning, Vietnam'' (1987) and the moving drama of
``Awakenings'' (1990) to Disney's animated ``Aladdin'' (1992) and
even a 1988 Broadway stint in Samuel Beckett's bleak comedy,
``Waiting for Godot.''
 &HT;    In keeping withhis reputation for the unexpected, the
47-year-old Williams announced at the Toronto Film Festival in
mid-September that he may return to performing live on stage.
 &HT;    Which doesn't mean an end to his film career, of course. After
finishing ``Jakob'' he filmed Disney's ``Bicentennial Man,''
reteaming with Chris Columbus, who directed Williams' hit ``Mrs.
Doubtfire'' (1993). Due to open in December, the film casts him as
a robot who gradually becomes more human.
 &HT;    Next year he'll go serious again to star in ``Damien of
Molokai,'' the story of a Belgian priest who cared for lepers in
Hawaii in the late l800s.
 &HT;    Making ``Jakob the Liar'' was something of a labor of love,
Williams says, because it allowed him to run the whole gamut of
humor.
 &HT;    ``Sometimes it's a black comedy, sometimes it's physical,
sometimes it's medicine _ different types, different forms,'' he
says. ``Sometimes it can be outrageous, and sometimes it's so
subtle.''
 &HT;    And he hopes audiences will come away from the picture with a
lot more than a few giggles.
 &HT;    ``The humanity of it,'' he says. ``A memory of people, a memory
of lives. It's a very intimate portrayal of life in the face of
death.''

JUDGE LEFT NO DOUBT WHO CALLS THE SHOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Only one federal judge in Massachusetts has summoned
to his courtroom two different US attorneys as well as the regional
boss of the FBI for on-the-spot tongue-lashings.
</P>
<P>
   And only one federal judge has trooped a parade of lawyers in a
major Mafia case into the courthouse pressroom to personally
deliver a ruling he thought reporters should cover.
</P>
<P>
   US District Judge Mark L. Wolf, the jurist who crafted the
661-page decision that keeps intact criminal charges against the
region's top mobsters, likes to be in charge, reigning at his own
pace.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf clearly relished directing the spectacle that played out in
his courtroom for most of last year, overseeing a cast of FBI
agents, and the occasional mobster, summoned to the witness stand
to talk about the shadowy world where lawmen and outlaws meet.
</P>
<P>
   And while Wolf is known for devoting vast time and effort to
every task, from devising court policies on indigent defendants to
selecting high school interns, he has plunged into no subject more
deeply than the New England Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the 52-year-old Reagan appointee has in his 14 years on
the bench become the de facto Mafia judge. Uncannily, Wolf has
drawn one racketeering case after another in the court's
computer-monitored lottery, and he has handled each with a singular
devotion _ some say bordering on obsession.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's paid to decide cases, not to crusade against the
government,'' said one former federal prosecutor not involved in
this case. ``This Whitey Bulger thing is important, but so are a
lot of other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's decision was a year in the making and nearly five
years after the hierarchy of the region's Irish and Italian mobs
was charged with extortion and racketeering. That period was five
times the median length of time it takes for a criminal case to be
resolved in the nation's federal courts, according to court
records.
</P>
<P>
   And the case isn't over. As Wolf writes in his 74-page summary:
``This case has been pending for almost five years. The defendants'
motions to dismiss and to suppress have been the subject of
intensive litigation for more than two years. Nevertheless, the
merits of (Stephen ``The Rifleman'') Flemmi's motion to dismiss
cannot yet be decided. Thus the present posture of this case may be
disappointing to the parties and to the public, as it is, frankly,
to the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: more hearings.
</P>
<P>
   That intense level of involvement in so many Mafia cases may
have imparted a sense of personal outrage in Wolf when he
discovered that he, too, had been in the dark in the past when
deciding on wiretaps and prison terms without knowing that Flemmi,
James ``Whitey'' Bulger, and Angelo ``Sonny'' Mercurio were FBI
informants.
</P>
<P>
   But Wolf supporters say his motivation for hauling in
prosecutors and agents to face tough and embarrassing questions was
focused solely on the greater good.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the most public-spirited person I have ever met,'' said
Michael Kendall, a former Wolf protege in the US Attorney's office
who has shared an interest with him in aiding Southeast Asian
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Even Richard S. Swensen, former special agent in charge of the
Boston office of the FBI, found merit in the public flogging. ``The
judicial airing of allegations in this matter, albeit at a slow
pace, might have been healthier than letting them be whispered
about and festering below the surface,'' said Swensen, who heads
the Boston office of Investigative Group International.
</P>
<P>
   To some, Wolf's glacial pace is grounded in profound concerns
about being overturned on appeal. The result: exhaustive compiling
of testimony leading to down-the-middle rulings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You brief about briefing, that's the Wolfian problem,'' said
one lawyer not involved in the present case. ``You have a hearing
to decide on what to brief, and you brief on what the hearing will
be about. It's endless.''
</P>
<P>
   The practice, say Wolf's fans and critics, was born of painful
experience. It was Wolf, as an assistant in William Weld's US
Attorney's office, who aggressively investigated the Kevin White
administration, prosecuting Theodore Anzalone, White's one-time
chief fund-raiser. Anzalone was convicted of money laundering, but
the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit overturned the
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   As a judge, Wolf took great pains in the sentencing of Mafia
boss Raymond J. ``Junior'' Patriarca, only to be reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Some defendants, particularly Patriarca, have applauded Wolf for
treating them respectfully. But some people who have worked closely
with Wolf tell a different story. Law clerks say they have had to
ask permission before going to lunch or running an errand.
Witnesses have missed vacations or been forced to stay overnight
because of easily avoidable scheduling problems.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf, who lives in Weston, graduated from Yale University and
Harvard Law School. He is married and has two sons.
</P>
<P>
   While criminal defense lawyers have applauded Wolf for probing
the dark corners of FBI conduct, some were disappointed that he
stopped short of punishing the government by dropping charges or
seriously weakening the case against the last generation of
big-name gangsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Wolf is an extraordinarily bright judge, but I don't
think he or any other judge would have the courage to do what needs
to be done in that case,'' said Patriarca's lawyer, John F.
Cicilline.

SETTING THE WORLD ON FIREWIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most of you have probably never added a new hard drive to your
computer. You've missed the joys of untangling ribbon cables,
hunting for misplaced mounting screws, resetting your BIOS
software. And now there's a good chance you never will.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, you'll go to the store and buy a little hard drive that
fits in a shirt pocket. You'll also buy a length of wire only a
little thicker than a telephone cord. Then you'll plug one end of
the wire into your computer and another into your new drive. And
you'll be done. Instant gigabytes.
</P>
<P>
   I'm doing this already, with one of the most impressive new
products I've seen this year, a $379, four-gigabyte pocket hard
drive from VST Technologies Inc. in Acton, Mass. But when I wanted
to try out the drive, I had to leave my Pentium II PC behind. I
went to the desk of a colleague who uses one of Apple Computer
Inc.'s Power Macintosh G3 workstations.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the drive relies on FireWire, a technology
developed by Apple and mainly found on its high-end hardware. Work
on FireWire began in 1986, but was left to gather dust in the days
when the company had other things to worry about _ like meeting its
payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Restored to rude good health, Apple is confounding skeptics like
me by once again rolling out new technologies that are unmatched by
their bigger, richer rivals. Their cool gadget of the moment is the
new Macintosh G4 workstation, so powerful that national security
regulations bar Apple from selling it in a number of countries.
Apple's hilarious new ``lethal weapon'' TV ad is not just hype; I
confirmed the facts with the US Department of Commerce. My readers
from India will be grieved to learn they can't buy a G4 and ship it
home without an export license, for fear it might be used to make
guided missiles or the like.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm more interested in technologies that make it easier to
transmit data over the Net or share it with other electronic
devices. Which is why Apple's decision to put FireWire on its G3s,
and eventually on all its machines, is my pick for their smartest
move yet.
</P>
<P>
   Think of FireWire as the big brother of Universal Serial Bus, or
USB. These days many of us have USB keyboards, mice, or printers
attached to our computers. USB lets you plug in a device and start
using it without rebooting. But it only transmits 12 million bits
of data per second. That's more than fast enough for a mouse or
keyboard, but inadequate for a high-speed hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   The FireWire port in a G3 can handle 400 million bits of data
per second. I was able to copy a 25-megabyte file to the drive in
about 12 seconds, and it played full-screen, full-motion videos
flawlessly.
</P>
<P>
   You can daisy-chain up to 63 FireWire devices on a single cable.
The VST drive comes with two ports, so if you want to add yet
another drive, just plug it into the first, and so on. The FireWire
system even includes electrical power, so if you use just a few
devices, you don't have to plug them into a wall socket _ they'll
get their electricity from the FireWire. To switch it to another
computer, just close any open files, unplug the drive, and go.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to exaggerate the potential of FireWire, and not just
for computers. Nearly every digital camera and camcorder has an
``IEEE 1394'' port _ the technical name for FireWire. This means
users could connect them to FireWire-equipped computers and create
an instant video editing and image storage system. If you want to
keep a permanent copy of a favorite TV show, just plug in a
FireWire hard drive and store it there.
</P>
<P>
   It's all giving me a bad case of FireWire envy. My iMac doesn't
have FireWire, and Apple hasn't announced when it'll add the
feature to that popular line of computers. A mere handful of PCs
from Sony and Compaq are FireWire-compatible, not including my
Compaq PC. Windows 95, 98, and NT don't support it. But the new
Windows 98 Special Edition does, and so will Windows 2000. In a
year or so, FireWire will be standard on many PCs. But when you
start bragging about it, your pal who owns a Power Mac will give
you the official Mac-lover's sneer while smugly declaring, ``Apple
had it first.'' And your pal will be right.

HEAVEN IS NEARER THAN WE THINK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My friend Lynn had foreign house guests this summer, a young man
and woman who consider themselves full-time peace walkers. Marcus
and Atsuko spent last winter with a group walking from Auschwitz to
Hiroshima to commemorate the 50th anniversary of World War II and
to stir the conscience of the world. Then the two of them came to
Marblehead to continue their peace work and to earn a little money.
They arrived with nothing but the clothes on their backs and a
small backpack each, the sum total of their worldly goods. In the
weeks that followed, Atsuko tutored Japanese students at Salem
State College in English. Marcus, an Australian by birth, assisted
a stone mason.
</P>
<P>
   When fall arrived, they decided they had earned enough to drive
across the United States. There was only one problem. They had no
car. As such things go, however, fate intervened on their behalf.
Atsuko ran into a student whose car was so pathetic he was thinking
of ditching it. It was easy for her to persuade the desperate young
man to give the car to her and, confident of Marcus's skills with
an engine, the two of them set off at the end of August with their
two small backpacks.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn got a card a week later.
</P>
<P>
   It said: ``This car is near heaven!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you believe that?'' Lynn said to me in disbelief. ``The
car's already broken down twice, you know, and they're thrilled
that they've managed to cover 500 miles. Isn't that amazing?''
</P>
<P>
   We sat in Lynn's yard, contemplating Atsuko's words. It was
suddenly clear, in a way I'd never seen before, that the quality of
what you have makes much less difference to your enjoyment than
your attitude. If someone had offered them a chauffeur-driven limo,
Atsuko and Marcus couldn't have been more pleased. Their excitement
came, not from the car itself, but from their own overflowing
gratitude at finally having ``wheels.'' I shouldn't have been
surprised. All summer long, I'd noticed that they displayed an
acute appreciation of material benefits _ like bagels and lox for
breakfast _ that most of us, buried under an avalanche of things,
seem to have lost.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, an aunt warned me that the love of camping my husband
and I shared was doomed to end. ``As you get older, you'll want the
comforts of home,'' she prophesied, dismayed by our unheated,
unplumbed, unelectrified shelter in Vermont. As time goes by,
however, my husband Jack and I love it even more for the very
reason that Atsuko and Marcus love their car so much. When things
don't come easy, when you have so little that any small improvement
is earth-shaking, when you have to struggle to obtain a favorable
outcome, you find yourself filled with a dizzying delight that a
simple purchase cannot rival.
</P>
<P>
   Take staying clean in Vermont. There's a little pool in our
stream that forms a perfect bathtub. Every spring, however, heavy
runoff chokes the pool with sand and pokes holes in the dam we've
built. We devote an afternoon or two to pulling up rocks and
shoveling out the sand, rebuilding the dam and stopping the major
leaks. I never wash up without recalling the effort it took to
create such an delicious bathing spot. Covered with dirt, hot and
grimy from the day, I never sink into the icy water without
thinking, ``Oh, this is near heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   On cool days, we take hot showers, using our solar shower. We
found a branch from which we hang the plastic bag, with its
swinging nozzle. I nailed a piece of wood onto the tree for a soap
dish; Jack hung a tarp as a shower curtain for guests. The sun
doesn't work on cloudy days, so before we shower, we have to haul
water up from the stream, gather wood to start the fire, w
minutes, then carefully pour the hot water into the bag through a
funnel we've made from a plastic half-gallon jug.
</P>
<P>
   In order to leave some water for Jack, I get wet, turn off the
water, soap myself, and then give myself three lovely minutes of
hot water drizzling down my back and legs. By the time I grab a
towel off a nearby branch, I feel so clean and fresh I could laugh
out loud. It's thrilling to feel the cool air on my damp skin. I'm
eager for the comfort of a warm shirt as it slips over my head. I
never get into clean clothes without thinking, ``This is definitely
near heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Back home, of course, I wash without paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   Civilization always pales. Familiarity breeds indifference. How
perverse human nature is! Why is it that the key to thoroughly
enjoying what you have turns out to be having just enough and no
more?

FOR 2000, DESIGNERS SUGGEST WE LIGHTEN UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There's a mood swing in the air and on the runways
here this week, as more than 70 American designers showcase their
first collections of the new millennium. Clothes have a happy,
whimsical feeling. Ruffles are back. Color is everywhere. Spring
2000 promises to look fresh and upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   With designers seeming optimistic about Y2K, women's apparel may
experience a rebirth of sorts. The '90s will be remembered as a
decade of sartorial austerity, when minimalist silhouettes and
black and gray fabrics defined the chic look, and pockets were
derided as ``clutter.''
</P>
<P>
   In the upcoming decade, the fashion industry is apparently
intent on not taking itself too seriously. Rather than tidy
pantsuits or sweater sets, the modern silhouette will require a bit
of whimsy _ mixing and matching unexpected colors, fabrics, and
textures.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina Herrera's spring collection, for example, pairs patent
leather tops with cotton pants, suede tops with linen pants, and an
organza shirt with sequined pants.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Calderin, an instructor of fashion design at Lasell College
in Newton, said the mixing of textures is a key part of future
fashion. ``One of the main things of importance to a designer is to
create a center of interest,'' he said. Because many modern clothes
have a smooth finish (body-hugging stretch fabric, for example),
they need to be grounded by something warmer, softer, and textured
so they won't look too futuristic, he said. ``Designers are tying
in clever things like a crocheted scarf. . . something to make it
look more real.''
</P>
<P>
   After the monochromatic '90s, designer Han Feng's collection is
a shock. She unabashedly combines pink blouses with red skirts and
yellow blouses with green skirts. Linda Allard at Ellen Tracy mixes
blue shirts with yellow skirts and green shoes.
</P>
<P>
   William Calvert's spring collection includes a fire-engine red
sweater worn over pink pants. ``People will look cool in color.
Orange, fire-engine red, shocking pink. Sometimes, they'll wear it
mixed up, sometimes, tonal. . . Each piece has its own color and
identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Lou Andre, president of the wardrobe management company
Organization by Design, cautions consumers not to take the trend
too literally. ``It might look fabulous at a cocktail party, but
the big word is appropriateness. Don't let designers lead you down
that road. . . Color is hard to pull off. If you have a fuchsia
dress with a boa, you'd better have the right shoes with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite these post-feminist times, designers boldly placed
girlish ruffles on runways all week long. Design house Badgley
Mischka, the darling of the sophisticated Hollywod set, put a
ruffled hem on a turquoise sequined evening gown. Whether that
dress makes it to the Oscars remains to be seen. Designer Rebecca
Taylor put ruffles down the front of one dress and around the
collar of a top. Oscar de la Renta placed ruffles down the back,
around the neck, and completely around various gowns.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, synthetic fabrics like Tencel and
polyester have been promoted as a comfortable and nonwrinkling
option, especially for people who travel frequently. But this
spring, cotton and other natural fabrics appear to be making a
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Designer Donna Morgan, who calls cotton a ``sleeper'' fabric,
said at least half of her spring line will be made from cotton.
Herrera and design house BCBG Max Azria also embraced the fabric.

QUARTERBACKS SEEING A MIRROR IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Do you think when Peyton Manning looks in
the mirror he sees Drew Bledsoe? And do you think when Drew Bledsoe
looks at video of himself from six years ago he sees Peyton
Manning?
</P>
<P>
   Two of the AFC's best gunslingers will go head-to-head Sunday at
Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   They are both mild-mannered, polite, and come from strong
families where their fathers, in particular, were heavily involved
in their football development. Mac Bledsoe was Drew's high school
coach, while Archie Manning was an outstanding NFL quarterback who
seemed to teach his son the right path to success at the University
of Tennessee and now at Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Both Manning and Bledsoe had outstanding rookie seasons, poised
beyond their years. They are both pocket quarterbacks who ``like to
get the ball out to the real athletes,'' as Bledsoe put it
Wednesday. Both were instrumental in bringing their respective
organizations from doormat to contender. Well, the jury is still
out on the Colts, who were 3-13 a year ago. But following a 31-14
win over the Buffalo Bills last Sunday, Manning could be on his way
to doing what Bledsoe did in his second pro season _ leading his
team into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peyton looks very good,'' said Bledsoe. ``He's progressed very
quickly. He looks completely different now than the quarterback we
saw the first time we played them last season. He's had one of the
more successful rookie seasons ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Bledsoe and Manning were involved in flip-the-coin
decisions on draft day _ the Patriots decided on Bledsoe over Rick
Mirer in '93 and the Colts took Manning over Ryan Leaf last year.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bledsoe who talked to Manning after his junior season,
when Manning was toying with the idea of turning pro. Bledsoe told
Manning about his first year and the difficulties associated with
leaving school.
</P>
<P>
   Manning, taking the advice of Bledsoe and others, including his
father, elected to stay at Tennessee. He then won the Heisman
Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   And the extra year helped Manning quickly lose the
deer-in-the-headlights look he had in that first game against New
England Sept. 14, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Manning said the talk with Bledsoe helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``He faced a similar situation,'' Manning said. ``He was a
quarterback who had the chance to come out early. He came out and
he gave me his reasons, including that he didn't have a very good
team coming back and that he worried about getting hurt because of
it and hurting his chances in the draft. He just said, `Do what you
want to do because you can't look back.' He said, `You're going to
struggle.' It was something I had to accept. So I did what I had to
do and I had a chance to get through my senior year and prepare
better for the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said he spoke to Manning to give him ``perspective''
rather than advice, the same thing Manning is now doing for
Cleveland rookie Tim Couch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just gave him the understanding of what was going to happen
to him,'' said Bledsoe. ``He knew it was going to be hard. But he
got through those times and maintained his confidence. You're
starting to see the fruits of that already. He was more successful
his rookie season than I was. He had the best rookie season of any
rookie quarterback ever. Now they're going to have to develop a
team around him, just as they did around me. If they continue to do
that, he can take them to where they want to be. They looked
awfully good last week. They beat Buffalo and it was a real
beating. It wasn't fluke plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning threw 28 interceptions last season _ three against the
Patriots in Week 2 _ but he also threw for 26 touchdowns and 3,739
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said the Colts' brass allowed Manning to make mistakes,
just as Bill Parcells and the Patriots had done with Bledsoe back
in 1993, when the Patriots went 5-11.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a rookie quarterback out there, you have to let
him make mistakes and stick with him,'' said Bledsoe. ``It's a
tribute to his coaching staff that they did that with Peyton
because he's going to be so far ahead because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning said he thanked Colts coach Jim Mora and general manager
Bill Polian after last season for ``showing patience with me.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times when I could have been over my head. The New
England game was a good example. It wasn't much fun, throwing three
interceptions and fumbling. What Coach Mora told me is it's easy to
come out of the game when you throw an interception, but it's hard
to stay in and avoid the fourth and fifth interception. I felt I
learned some things and I realized it's a long-term thing and you
have to be in it for the long haul.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning learned about perseverance and that there was always
next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be mentally strong and when you have a bad game,
you have to respond the next week,'' Manning said. ``Talent has a
lot to do with it. You have to work hard to stay effective.''
</P>
<P>
   As he waited for Manning's game to mature, Polian decided to
trade Marshall Faulk, an older running back, and replace him with
rookie first-round pick Edgerrin James. The Colts' offensive line
is young, as are receivers Marvin Harrison and E.G. Green. Like the
Patriots back in '94, the Colts should be together for a while.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, mature quarterbacks come back to a city
where they were embarrassed and try to exact revenge. That 29-6
loss to the Patriots still haunts Manning. Two of his throws went
to Ty Law, one for a 59-yard touchdown. The third went to Lawyer
Milloy. But even in that game, Manning completed 21 of 33 attempts
for 188 yards and a touchdown. Last year, Manning's offensive line
protected him well, surrendering only 22 sacks, in part because
Manning got rid of the ball quickly. He is trained to dump the ball
if he feels pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're playing on the road in front of a hostile crowd,
like last year when we had fumbles and interceptions, you don't
have a chance,'' Manning said. ``The main thing is to protect the
ball. If you're going to beat New England, you have to score points
because their offense is so good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our division, I think, is the best in football. Buffalo,
Miami, the Jets, and New England are excellent teams and whoever
wins it has to be a favorite to win the Super Bowl. We're a better
team, but everyone is better, too. Beating Buffalo gives us a lot
of confidence, but New England had a huge win over the Jets. It's
funny but you don't hear New England mentioned as much but we have
the upmost respect for them.''
</P>
<P>
   What became obvious to Manning, as it had for Bledsoe, is that
the offseason between the first and second years is critical. It's
the first year a player can take part in the conditioning program
and work with other players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have fun last season, so we worked hard in the
offseason,'' said Manning. ``All the receivers stayed here in the
offseason and we worked on our timing. This year, we had that, and
I feel we're on the same page because of it. I can take that and
add to it that last year I took every snap and I saw a lot of
different defenses. I faced a lot of situations, two-minute drills
and protecting leads. I'm a not a 10-year vet, but I feel I saw a
lot. I appreciate the patience they showed and now I'm trying not
to make as many mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are hoping Manning has another learning experience
Sunday, though they fully understand they will be paid back for
that first game, sooner or later.

CITIZENS LINE UP TO DONATE BLOOD TO SHOOTING VICTIMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL BOURGEOIS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Feeling helpless and wanting to help in any
way they could, dozens of people were lined up even before the
doors opened Thursday at the Carter BloodCare Center in the city's
Hospital District.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Wednesday evening's shooting at a Baptist church,
blood supplies were low because of routine local demand, and many
supplies from across the nation already were en route to the East
Coast in anticipation of Hurricane Floyd, said Viqui Litman, the
blood center spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours after the center on Rosedale Street had opened, they
had received more donors than they normally receive in a week, but
still more is needed, Litman said.
</P>
<P>
   She said that, with multiple gunshot wounds, one patient could
easily go through more than 50 units of blood.
</P>
<P>
   The blood center's Dr. Leland Baskin said the shootings were
straining the bank's already short supplies. Baskin said the demand
is up 10 percent this year, while supplies are down 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were short on all types. We were in the `red zone,' meaning
we were down to double digits on O-negative and O-positive,''
Litman said.
</P>
<P>
   Litman said Carter BloodCare, its satellite offices and blood
mobiles were extending hours. A temporary blood donation unit also
was set up at John Peter Smith Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be here for as long as it takes,'' Litman said.
</P>
<P>
   The wait was 2 or 3 hours, but that didn't faze many donors.
</P>
<P>
   Brandie Bach of Arlington, said her husband, a Fort Worth police
officer, was working at the crime scene and she wanted to do her
part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's a terrible tragedy. They said the
neighborhood needs to come together and give blood. I think it's
the least we can do. It's just terrible that something like this
had to happen to get everybody to come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Gray said he was a friend of the family of Justin Ray, who
was listed among the dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known the family for seven years and I watched him grow
up,'' Gray said. ``It's strange because just the other day I saw
him and he was showing off the truck he had just bought with his
own money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good kid. The only gang he belonged to was the Boy
Scouts,'' Gray said. ``It all makes me wonder what's wrong with
society. People should be safe at home, at school ... and
particularly if you can't be safe at church what is wrong with
society?
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's not just guns. If they took away all the guns, there
still would be people chunking rocks at each other,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm speechless,'' said Lisa Taylor of south Fort Worth. She
said she grew up two blocks from Wedgwood Baptist, where the
shooting took place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the Prince of Darkness stealing from America.
Giving blood is my way of reaching out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Davis of east Fort Worth said he's a regular blood donor.
The shooting prompted him to donate sooner than he had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just terrible. I lived in Littleton, Colorado, for a
time. It's all too strange. Now it's happening in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Littleton has a stigma because of the shootings there.
Now Fort Worth has joined the ranks of the infamous cities. It's
all kind of sad,'' Davis said.

   ``It was just too close to home,'' said Gabrielle Schmidt of
Crowley. ``You feel so helpless. I think that's why you see so many
people here today. Everyone wants to reach out and help.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marines were there, too. A group from the 14th Marine
Regiment at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth were at
the blood center early.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us have kids, too,'' said Marine Chris Dickinson.
``This is hard for their families. You try to put yourself in their
shoes.''

DE LA HOYA-TRINIDAD FIGHT IS ON A RECORD PACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Athletes, promoters, agents, and team owners all
love to say the same thing. ``It's not about the money,'' they tell
you while they stuff their pockets with cash.
</P>
<P>
   Well, this week it is about the money and nobody is trying to
hide it.
</P>
<P>
   Money is pouring into Las Vegas and into the coffers at TVKO,
the pay-per-view arm of HBO that will distribute the broadcast of
Saturday night's welterweight unification fight between Oscar De La
Hoya and Felix Trinidad. With three days to go, there is talk that
this will become the first non-heavyweight fight to do at least one
million pay-per-view sales, and promoter Bob Arum is promising it
will shatter the previous non-heavyweight record of more than
800,000 buys and $34 million in pay-per-view revenue, which De La
Hoya set with Pernell Whitaker two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not an issue,'' Arum boasted Wednesday. ``It's going to
leave every non-heavyweight fight in the dust. The only question is
how close does it come to the heavyweight pay per views.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a question no one can answer, but Mark Taffet, senior
vice president of TVKO and the point man of the fight's
distribution, was cautiously optimistic Wednesday while trying to
downplay Arum's bombast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a heavyweight unification fight with Lennox Lewis and
Evander Holyfield and it did 1.2 million, so that's the ceiling,''
Taffet said. ``Can this fight top that? You don't top a heavyweight
unification fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will it do very well? Yes. Will it set a new record? We can
only hope.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is hoping more than Arum's longtime rival, promoter Don
King. While De La Hoya is guaranteed roughly $21 million and
Trinidad $8.5 million, after King lops his $2 million promotional
fee off the top of Trinidad's $10.5 million purse, King stands to
cash in big time if the fight tops the 850,000 mark because he will
rake in $8 for every person who pays $49.95 to watch the bout over
that figure.
</P>
<P>
   If the fight does 1 million buys that would equate to $50
million in pay-per-view revenue alone and it would mean King takes
in an additional $1.2 million. It is assumed Trinidad would get a
piece of that additional revenue, but such assumptions are
dangerous when King is involved because no one swings a faster or
more lethal calculator than he does.
</P>
<P>
   King has accused Arum of not doing enough to promote the bout to
purposely cut down on those sales, claiming ``Arum would rather
lose money than see me make any money,'' but nothing could be
further from the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Radio, television, and national newspapers will be saturated
this week with ads, including a lengthy list of cross-promotional
advertising with cosponsors of the fight such as Puma and Met-Rx.
Both have deals with De La Hoya and are running ads that mention
their products in conjunction with their spokesman's Saturday night
showdown with Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   The real measure of how money is driving this match came at the
final press conference at Paris Las Vegas Casino Resort (which
comes complete with its own mini Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe)
when De La Hoya came to the podium to speak of his greatest
challenge. It was nearly five minutes before he got to Trinidad
after first mentioning TVKO, HBO, Time-Warner, Puma, Met-Rx,
Budweiser, Kodak, McDonald's, Mennan, and Excite.com, the official
website of the Trinidad-De La Hoya fight.
</P>
<P>
   And that list doesn't include the many business connections
around the country, international television revenue, ticket sales
to the soldout event at the 12,000-seat Mandalay Bay Events Center,
and other spinoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The bout will be televised in 60 countries and in Hispanic areas
sales have already skyrocketed. In Puerto Rico, Trinidad's
birthplace and home, Arum claimed more than 30 percent of the
island's pay-per-view capacity had already been bought and was
estimating there would be an 80 percent buy rate by the opening
bell.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, there are 43 million addressable homes in the US and,
as Arum points out, ``if we do 3 percent, it's 1.3 million. I think
we can do 4 or 5 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   That seems a bit of a reach, even by Arum's standards, but HBO
senior vice president for programming Lou DiBella conceded,
``Hispanics are the most loyal fans boxing has. They buy fights at
a far higher percentage than other demographic groups and this has
everything they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a Mexican-American hero in Oscar and a Puerto Rican
one in Trinidad. They have a fight whose outcome is being debated
and is in doubt. They have two great champions. It's too early to
tell how it will do, but the early (pay-per-view) numbers are
sensational. Compared to other big fights, it's tracking well.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared to other big fights, it's scalping well, too. Prime
tickets are going for $7,000 each and average seats are being sold
for $3,000-$4,000. The fight was the first in Las Vegas history not
to have a single ticket available for public sale, all of them
having been snapped up by the casinos and the two promoters. The
live gate has been estimated to be worth $13.5 million, which would
be nearly twice the previous non-heavyweight high set by De La Hoya
and Julio Cesar Chavez at Caesars Palace in 1996, when they did
$7,579,100 on sales of 14,738 seats.
</P>
<P>
   By way of comparison, the largest live gate in Vegas history was
the $14,277,200 Evander Holyfield and Mike Tyson did for their
first fight at the MGM Grand Garden in 1996, in a building that
seated more than 16,000. Had the fight been staged at the Thomas
and Mack Center on the UNLV campus (as Lewis-Holyfield II will be
Nov. 13), it is estimated De La Hoya-Trinidad would still have been
a sellout and might have shattered the Holyfield-Tyson record.
</P>
<P>
   With all this as background, Leonard Armato, agent of Shaquille
O'Neal among other sporting luminaries, will hold a summit meeting
Friday at Mandalay Bay for all of De La Hoya's major sponsors.
Armato, who runs the marketing end of De La Hoya's career, will
call together representatives of Met-Rx, Puma, McDonald's, MCI,
Logo Athletic, EMI (the recording company that has signed De La
Hoya to do a CD of Latino love songs), Budweiser, and Electronic
Arts video games, who together have paid his client an estimated $9
million this year in promotional fees.
</P>
<P>
   They will not be here to talk about the fight. They'll be here
to talk about the money.

`FREAKS AND GEEKS' IS A TEEN SHOW NOT NECESSARILY AIMED AT KIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Television was once dominated by a strict demarcation: Half-hour
entertainment shows were usually comedies, and one-hour programs
were almost always dramas. Now, there are no lines, as one-hour
sitcoms (sans laugh tracks) abound, and drama is crammed into
half-hour shows like ``Sports Night.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is ``Freaks and Geeks,'' a one-hour comedy that
scares the bejesus out of anyone my age.
</P>
<P>
   The new NBC offering takes a ``nostalgic'' look at high school,
circa 1980. Here is what is scary: (1.) My time in high school is
now far enough removed to qualify as ``nostalgia.'' When did my
teen years fall into the same category as ``Happy Days''? (2.)
Creator Paul Feig and executive producer Judd Apatow have
reproduced the era to perfection, from the clothes to the music
(dude, Zeppelin cranks) to the laissez-faire social attitudes that
existed before the Just-Say-No epoch.
</P>
<P>
   This last part will be a tricky proposition for the show based
on Feig's high school days in Michigan, a time when drug use,
especially pot, was extremely commonplace, drunken-driving was
something kids laughed about and schools had cigarette-smoking
areas marked off _ for students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We deal with it head on,'' Feig said. ``We don't moralize
anything. If you moralize it ... kids are going to turn it off like
that. A lot of people did it, we aren't going to say they didn't.
(But) we never are going to say it's cool.''
</P>
<P>
   But here is something different: this is a teen show that,
heavens to WB, is not necessarily aimed at kids. You would think a
high school show slated for Saturday nights (premiering this week)
would be deader than Leif Garrett's career.
</P>
<P>
   But besides geeks, there will be a segment of viewers who may be
interested in this show who will be home: those of us in high
school in 1980 who aren't going to spring for a baby-sitter every
Saturday night. There could be enough people hanging out, trying to
remember days when they were cool, or at least thought they were,
for the show to stick.
</P>
<P>
   It also helps that this is really, really funny, with some
realistic angst thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   The story is universal _ high school life in fact hasn't changed
all that much. There are still ``freaks'' (stoners, burnouts, pick
your nomenclature) and ``geeks'' (nerdy outsiders). There are still
bullies and the bullied, although the 9mm in the backpack is a
tragic new wrinkle.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Freaks and Geeks'' is better digested if one knows who
John Bonham was (Led Zeppelin drummer who lived life harder than he
pounded his kit), or can hum old Styx songs (lame pop camouflaged
by power chords). And for people of that age there are going to be
uncomfortable moments watching this show, faded memories
retriggered by a song or a T-shirt or catch phrase, of the less fun
side of high school that we have pushed back in our minds.
</P>
<P>
   One of the kids to watch in this series is Samm Levine, who
plays geek Neal. The kid has the personality (and passing physical
resemblance) of a young Albert Brooks, and is blessed with the
ability to do a pretty good Capt. Kirk impersonation.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other kids on the show, as well as young actors on
another period comedy, ``That '70s Show'' (Fox), Levine said he is
playing a teen from another time just as he would play one from
today. After all, there were jerks then, there are jerks now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the freedom to play the part pretty much the same
way,'' he said. ``Kids are always faced with the same problems,
whether it is 1980 or 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine even did some research, not so much for the show as for
his own survival. ``When I was a freshman, after having such a
terrible time in high school, being shoved into lockers, I found
friends of mine who were in their 20s and 30s,'' Levine said. ``I
said, `What was it like when you were in high school? Was it any
different?' They said, `No. I got pushed around by bullies, too.'''
</P>
<P>
   You can call that reassuring, I guess. The song remains the
same. If you didn't get the reference in that last line, ask an
elder. They are probably home.

JAZZ INNOVATOR HORACE SILVER ON A MISSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Five years ago, jazz legend Horace Silver checked
into the hospital and nearly checked out of this earthly life. The
pianist had blood clots in his legs and lungs; one night, he
stopped breathing and his family was told to prepare for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   Silver made it through that night and the subsequent three-week
hospital stay as well as a recent 10-day hospitalization that saw
him confronting the same malady. Now, stronger and healthier,
having just celebrated his 71st birthday with family and friends,
Silver thinks back to those times of discomfort and feels almost
glad for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got me thinking, that's for sure,'' Silver says from the
living room of his home in Malibu. `` &UR;  &LR; `Well, God may have spared
me this time, but I don't know how much longer I've got on this
earth. So I'd better try to make hay while the sun is shining and
try to get as many songs out as I can.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Because, you know, I've got all these tunes sitting on the
shelf that God has given me and he didn't give them to me to just
sit in the closet. He gave them to me to share with the world. And
that's what I've got to do while I'm still able.''
</P>
<P>
   If Silver speaks with an evangelical zeal about his musical
mission, it's because he has spent more than half a century
creating a body of work that few jazz musicians can touch. He and
drummer Art Blakey defined the hard bop movement in the 1950s,
developing a sound that blended blues and gospel into a passionate
mix that came to be described as ``soul jazz.'' The two artists
also virtually invented the quintet model that had a simple front
line _ tenor sax, trumpet _ backed by a rhythm section of bass,
drums and piano.
</P>
<P>
   The consistently outstanding quintet recordings Silver made in
those early days for Blue Note and continued to deliver to the
classic jazz label for some 28 years are celebrated in a new,
four-disc set, ``Horace Silver Retrospective,'' released Tuesday.
The box's 45 prime selections begin with Silver's first trio
compositions, takes in a generous selection of his classic
jazz-funk recordings like ``Senor Blues,'' ``Filthy McNasty,''
``Sister Sadie'' and ``Doodlin''' and ends with several the
pianist's underappreciated 1970s gems.
</P>
<P>
   The collection coincides with the release of ``Jazz Has a Sense
of Humor'' (Verve), an album of nine new Silver compositions that
swings with the same infectious joy that characterizes his best
work on Blue Note. The album's title reflects Silver's strong
belief that music has the power to lighten spirits and make people
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the good Lord has blessed musicians with talent in
order to make people happy,'' Silver says. ``All the arts can make
people happy, but, in my personal opinion, I think music comes
first in uplifting people and then comedy second. So why not
combine the two?''
</P>
<P>
   Since Silver took an interest in metaphysics some 30 years ago,
his music has often taken on a rather fervent mystical tone. One
Blue Note set from 1970 aimed to ``bring a little more health,
happiness, love and peace into life.'' A 1997 album, ``A
Prescription for the Blues,'' pictured the pianist wearing a
doctor's lab coat on the cover, his hands holding a pestle and
mortar.
</P>
<P>
   In person, Silver comes across as animated as one of his famed
quintet recordings. It's easy to see why Miles Davis hired Silver
to play with him on several mid-'50s recording dates for both the
Blue Note and Prestige labels. The man's enthusiasm is positively
contagious, not to mention contagiously positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put a fire in my playing,'' Davis wrote of Silver in his
autobiography. ``I wanted to take the music back to the fire and
improvisations of be-bop ... But I also wanted to take the music
forward into a more funky kind of blues, the kind of thing that
Horace would take us to.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver's most famous recording remains the title cut from his
1965 album, ``Song for My Father.'' Even if you haven't heard the
song, you probably have. Steely Dan songwriters Donald Fagen and
Walter Becker more or less appropriated ``Father's'' bass line for
their hit, ``Rikki Don't Lose That Number.'' (``I was flattered,''
Silver says. ``And it's given me a good bit of promotion, too.'')
</P>
<P>
   Silver wrote ``Song for My Father'' after visiting Brazil with
Sergio Mendes and returning home with a bossa nova beat stuck in
his head. The melody he came up with, though, was Cape Verdean, a
sound Silver's Portugese father enjoyed while growing up in Maio of
the Cape Verde Islands, located off the coast of Senegal in Africa.
The elder Silver had tried for many years to persuade his son to
jazz up a Cape Verdean folk song and ``Song for My Father'' was a
way to honor the request.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, it was a way of honoring the man who pointed him
toward his life-long career. Silver was 10 and living in Norwalk,
Conn., when his father and uncle brought home an old upright piano
obtained from neighbors who were moving to Florida. Silver's father
played guitar and violin (his mother died when he was 9) and often
performed with various relatives and friends at parties.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing his neighbors play, the young Silver decided he
wanted to learn piano, too. But he found the lessons tougher _ and
duller _ than he imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd learn to play a tune in two weeks, but they had
me playing all these boring scales,'' Silver recalls laughing. ``I
wanted to quit, but my dad said, `No. You wanted this piano, so you
stick with it. You're going to thank me for this one of these
days.' And I certainly do thank him for it!''
</P>
<P>
   Silver quickly developed his own irresistible style, emphasizing
rhythm and subtle, buoyant melodies, incorporating the techniques
of a variety of influences _ Thelonious Monk, Bud Powell, Teddy
Wilson and Art Tatum, among others. For Silver, having an
individual voice is everything. He remembers one day, early in his
career, playing piano at a friend's house when the doorbell rang
and the great Monk walked into the room.
</P>
<P>
   Monk watched Silver play, standing over the young pianist while
he worked out his song, and, at one point, Monk, never one to keep
his opinions to himself, reached over Silver's shoulders and said,
``Hey, man, why don't you play this part here like this?' and then
showed Silver how he thought the song should be played.
</P>
<P>
   Silver's response?
</P>
<P>
   ```I said, Well, Monk, yeah, that's beautiful, but I kind of
like it the way I do it,''' Silver remembers. ``And he thought I
was just saying that because I didn't want to sound like him, and
you know what? He was right. As much as I respected Monk, I didn't
want to be no Thelonious Monk clone. I want to be Horace Silver,
somebody with his own voice and style.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's what I tell all these young musicians today,''
Silver continues. ``It's the stylists that have the lasting
recognition. There's a lot of fine musicians out there now. You
hear these guys playing their butts off, but who are they, you
know? They're schooled in technique, they can improvise, but when
the record is over, I still need the announcer to tell me who they
are.
</P>
<P>
   ``The older guys, you didn't have to wait. You knew the sound
right off. `Oh, that's Art Farmer playing trumpet.' Or `That's
Clifford Brown.' Or Hank Mobley. Or Joe Henderson.''
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of trumpeter Brown, all the musicians Silver
named were part of his legendary Blue Note quintets during his long
stint with the label. Silver has always had a knack for discovering
fine, young musicians. His new album, ``Jazz Has a Sense of
Humor,'' features several such players, and he's already thinking
about using them again on his next album, the beginnings of which
are evident on the writing table next to his piano. It's full of
eraser shavings.
</P>
<P>
   ``My contract calls for one record a year, and that's kind of
tough with the backlog of material I have,'' Silver says. ``And I
keep writing. I can't stop. I don't want to stop. I've got so much
more I want to say. I need another 50 years.'' &UR;  &QL;

THE CHICKS ARE MAKING A KILLING OFF `GOODBYE EARL'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dixie Chicks' ``Fly'' has been the hottest country CD since
its recent release _ and perhaps the hottest song on it is a little
number about friendship, a marriage gone very bad and a deadly
serving of black-eyed peas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goodbye Earl'' _ ``that Earl song'' for short _ tells the
story of two high-school friends, Mary Anne and Wanda, who conspire
to kill Wanda's abusive husband after he ``walked right through
that restraining order and put her in intensive care.''
</P>
<P>
   Country and folk music are no strangers to death: Classics such
as ``Knoxville Girl'' and ``Pretty Polly'' recount horrible ends,
and Garth Brooks' controversial ``The Thunder Rolls'' also dealt
with domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Earl'' _ well, ``Earl'' is different. Spirited and brisk,
it's a ``happy'' tune, with none of the tense drama of ``Thunder''
and a can't-help-but-sing-along chorus. Just try not tapping your
toes as lead singer Natalie Maines recounts the two serving up a
lethal dinner, wrapping Earl in a tarp and disposing of him in a
nearby lake, or hollering ``Earl had to die! Goodbye Earl!'' along
with her.
</P>
<P>
   In just over a week, ``Goodbye Earl'' has become country music's
conversation piece, ``like an Elvis bust on a coffee table,'' as
one local music director puts it: Dozens and dozens of listeners
around the country are requesting it, and it's receiving as much
airplay as the CD's flagship single, ``Ready to Run,'' in some
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's huge, huge _ and the response is overwhelmingly
positive,'' says Smokey Rivers, assistant program director for
KPLX/99.5 FM in Fort Worth-Dallas, adding that the station is
playing ``Earl'' ``four or five times a day,'' as much as ``Run.''
``It's our strongest request right now. We played four or five
tracks when the CD came out, but this one took off. I think people
are treating it as a tongue-in-cheek deal, not a real story.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chicks' first CD, ``Wide Open Spaces,'' has sold more than 6
million copies, earned the trio the Grammy for best country album,
and remains at No. 2 and No. 23 on the Billboard country and pop
charts, respectively, more than 18 months after its release.
</P>
<P>
   So the early response to ``Fly,'' which was released Aug. 24,
has been huge. And the word-of-mouth generated by ``Earl'' is a
major reason why.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it _ it's an in-your-face song and it has a great
hook,'' says Jamie Matteson, country music editor at Gavin.
``Usually when you think of a song like this, it'll be a sad
ballad, a cry-on-your-sleeve record. This is like taking control of
the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   And while ``Earl'' is mostly seen as a fantasy, to some it's
extremely real. Both Rivers and Jay Roberts, music director of
WQYK/99.5 FM in Tampa, Fla., say that numerous listeners have
called in with their own stories of domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   In Tampa, that meant devoting more than an hour of a recent
morning show to women who wanted to talk about their experiences;
the station also gave out numbers of area women's shelters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very emotional,'' Roberts says. ``One lady said she's
gone through years of abuse, and her 13-year-old daughter finally
convinced her to leave and get help.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Rivers says his station has received no complaints,
others have. Roberts says ``Earl'' is ``polarizing'' and that some
callers think the lyrics are too strong.
</P>
<P>
   And over at KSCS/96.3 FM in Fort Worth-Dallas, music director
Linda O'Brian reports about an 80-20 split of positive and negative
feedback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people love it, say it's ``Fried Green Tomatoes'' set to
music, and a very vocal group of people hate it,'' she says. ``They
think it promotes violence and teaches (that) vigilantism is OK.
And the arguments these people make _ do their kids not play video
games or go to violent movies?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just campy and goofy and fun and tongue-in-cheek. There's
too many other things in life to angst over other than a new Dixie
Chicks record _ it's not worth getting a wrinkle over.''
</P>
<P>
   But for at least the next several weeks (and maybe longer) it's
certainly going to be worth talking about _ and controversy about a
song is always a very good way to get people to buy the CD it's on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said when the CD came out that it's another `Rumours,'''
says Rivers, referring to the 1977 Fleetwood Mac LP that generated
hit after hit and became one of the most popular records in
history. ``There's songs on `Fly' that are going to be huge. It's a
country masterpiece, for sure. We're going to be playing it for a
long time.''

BASEBALL OWNERS REJECT SALE OF OAKLAND A'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRIAN MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ Major League Baseball's concerns about the
long-term economic state of its game, in addition to some
behind-closed-doors politics, doomed former A's executive Andy
Dolich and Modesto supermarket magnate Bob Piccinini's $122.4
million bid to buy the Oakland A's.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball owners voted 28-2 on Wednesday to table any discussion
of the club's sale. They also blocked a sale of the Kansas City
Royals, another small-market team, and approved the sale of the
majority stake of the Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   The A's vote, executed in a stately resort on the banks of Lake
Otsego in baseball's birthplace, effectively kills any hope for the
Dolich-Piccinini group to buy the club, because a Monday deadline
for sale set by Oakland city officials will pass without any
further discussion of the bid. Owners shortened a two-day meeting
into one in order to leave town early and avoid any travel delays
associated with Hurricane Floyd, and voted early Wednesday evening
on the A's sale.
</P>
<P>
   Ownership of the club will stay in the hands of current owners
Steve Schott and Ken Hofmann, who bought the team in 1995 and now
have the option to put it up for sale to any new bids or keep the
team indefinitely. Schott and Hofmann, as part of an escape clause
in their contract with the city of Oakland and Alameda County, can
also now take the A's out of the Coliseum after the 2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolich-Piccinini group would have been bound by the existing
lease to keep the team at the Coliseum through 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Hofmann declined comment as he left the meeting, and Schott put
out a press release stating he and Hofmann were ``committed to
produce a competitive team and keep the franchise stable.'' There
was no mention of moving the team; nor was there mention of keeping
the team in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's business as usual,'' said A's team President Mike
Crowley. ``I'm already budgeting for next year.''
</P>
<P>
   East Bay politicians, some of whom made the trip to Cooperstown
to show support for what they believed was the best opportunity for
a long-term future in Oakland for the A's, were outraged at the
owners' vote. Some intimated the owners had rejected a solid
proposal in order to accomplish covert goals.
</P>
<P>
   Among the goals:
</P>
<P>
   _ To protect the San Francisco Giants' long-term viability as
they move into a new stadium and face debt-servicing issues.
</P>
<P>
   _ To reopen the bidding so the group headed by Arizona real
estate man Lyle Campbell, an ally of baseball Commissioner Bud
Selig, can re-enter the process. The Campbell group dropped out
when the city of Oakland and Alameda County officially recommended
the Dolich-Piccinini group to Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an elaborate scam,'' Alameda County Supervisor Mary King
said. ``We came here to be the conscience of a community, but
apparently Major League Baseball is not interested in conscience.
Maybe we wouldn't have wasted our time and energy and capital if we
knew Major League Baseball would sacrifice the city of Oakland's
interests for the San Francisco market. . . . Maybe the public is
out of its league when dealing with this power and influence that
goes beyond public scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Piccinini: ``I think Major League Baseball just kicked
Oakland right in the stomach. . . . They had a perfect opportunity
to make Oakland successful, and they short-circuited it. They're
scared about the long-term viability of the San Francisco market.
They can't allow it to fail.''
</P>
<P>
   At a hastily called news conference at Oakland City Hall
Wednesday, Mayor Jerry Brown said he had asked Hofmann whether he
would be interested in extending the lease agreement on the
Coliseum to keep the franchise in Oakland longer, but the developer
didn't give an answer.
</P>
<P>
   However, the mayor is hopeful Hofmann would be interested in
keeping the team in the East Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is from the area,'' Brown said. ``He's got a lot of money.
He likes the team. I don't see any reason why he would want to move
the team somewhere else. It's a dollars and cents business.
Political sentiments do not carry the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the sale acknowledged that the owners might
have been turned off by East Bay politicians' telling them who
would own one of their franchises. They also speculated that owners
might have rejected the bid in an attempt to get more money out of
a future bid, thus driving up the value of all the owners'
franchises.
</P>
<P>
   Another theory held that Schott and Hofmann had an interest in
killing the sale, since the team is winning and making money, and
the owners would then have the option of leaving the Coliseum after
2001. The A's are the third-lowest drawing team in the American
League, despite having the fifth best record.
</P>
<P>
   Selig said too many concerns existed about a small-market club
such as Oakland _ the A's $22 million payroll is among the lowest
in baseball _ being sold at a time when he had commissioned a
so-called ``blue-ribbon panel'' to produce a report on the game's
economic future. The panel includes Yale President Richard Levin,
political columnist George Will, former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell
and former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker.
</P>
<P>
   Dolich and Piccinini interpreted Selig's talk of the blue-ribbon
panel as the owners questioning the viability of Oakland as a
baseball market. The panel is said to be discussing long-term
solutions to the competitive problems affecting baseball, in which
small-market teams such as Montreal and Kansas City have trouble
beating big-market teams such as Atlanta and New York.

 &HT;    Dole puts her can-do record on the line
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jacksonville
</P>
<P>
   Out the windows of the swank River Club, the first distant signs
of Hurricane Floyd were taking shape on the horizon Monday as
Elizabeth Dole and Rep. Tillie Fowler worked the tables at a
$500-a-plate luncheon fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   It was a fitting backdrop for a candidate who touts her
leadership of one of the world's premier disaster relief
organizations, the American Red Cross, as part of a long list of
credentials. Fowler, the former Georgian who represents
Jacksonville in Congress, is one of many friends andassociates who
are playing major roles in Dole's campaign. She has known Dole for
25 years and named her youngest daughter, Elizabeth, after her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a strong conservative, without the hard edges,'' the
congresswoman, who sits on Dole's national finance committee, told
the group, which included one notable Democrat, former Florida Gov.
Farris Bryant, as well as regular Republican contributors and
members of the Jacksonville business community.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was time for Dole to step in front of the podium with a
clip-on microphone, a bit of choreography she has become known for
since she spoke for her husband at the 1996 Republican Convention
in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the stump speech without hard edges. The lines don't
change much from one campaign stop to another, and the delivery is
an unvarying combination of warmth, eye contact and upbeat, can-do
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   She speaks of her desire to ``energize'' younger Americans who
have turned away from the ``noble endeavor'' of public service
``because, frankly, of the ugliness of politics in some cases.''
</P>
<P>
   She delivers the line with a knowing look that makes it easy for
Republicans irate over President Clinton to understand what she's
talking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not running for president because I'm a woman, and I don't
want people to vote for me because I'm a woman. I want people to
vote for me because I'm the most qualified,'' Dole told an audience
at a luncheon last week in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it is difficult to talk about her style without
reference to her gender.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that she's a woman is a plus, but just her sense of
propriety and her appealing to the better side of us, I find very
attractive,'' said Georgia state Sen. Tom Price.
</P>
<P>
   In part, perhaps, because she is a woman attempting to do
something none has done before, her speech includes a litany of her
accomplishments, as president of the Red Cross and in an impressive
list of government posts.
</P>
<P>
   She reminds audiences that as transportation secretary, she was
the first woman to head a branch of the military, the Coast Guard,
which carried on an active program of drug interdiction on her
watch, and she managed the privatization of Conrail. She talks
about her role in resolving the bitter Pittston coal strike when
she was labor secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a seat-warmer,'' she told a group of Georgia
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Almost always, the speech begins with what she patly describes
as ``the bed joke,'' in ``Unlimited Partners,'' the joint
autobiography she wrote with her husband before his presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It's about a male supporter who wrote presidential candidate Bob
Dole to complain that a People magazine picture of the Doles making
up their bed together had led his wife to insist that he also help
out with housework. ``Buster, you don't know the half of it,'' the
former senator replied. ``The only reason she was helping make the
bed was because they were taking pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporters have criticized the scripted nature of her campaign.
``Doonesbury'' has lampooned it. But there's some truth in her
supporters' claim that Dole's front-of-the-podium delivery has an
impact.
</P>
<P>
   She seems to have the greatest impact on younger women, from the
businesswomen who lined up to be photographed with her in Atlanta
to the flag corps members in an Iowa high school band who reacted
excitedly when they spotted her waiting to begin marching in a
parade last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to bring a new generation of voters into her
campaign was a factor in Dole's strong third-place finish in the
Iowa GOP straw poll, and it's the selling point most often cited by
her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   To raise the money to compete with well-financed rivals, Dole is
spending much of her time these days raising money from Republicans
of the more traditional variety. It's a delicate process: Many of
her staunchest supporters, such as Fowler and Georgia co-chair
Oscar Persons, also have close ties to the Bush crowd.
</P>
<P>
   This effort has not been helped by the impression that her
campaign is in flux. In recent days her communications director,
Ari Fleischer, and press secretary, Michael Paranzino, have
resigned, saying they still support her but want to pursue other
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Dole has been criticized, perhaps unjustly, for not fleshing out
her stock speech with more substance on the issues. It's true that
she seldom varies her remarks and cuts off her press availabilities
at most appearances after a few questions.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, she has clearly defined positions on
antiballistic weapons and drugs. Her position on gun control _ she
says that if there are child safety locks on pill bottles there
ought to be on guns, and questions whether ``anyone needs an AK-47
or an Uzi to protect their families'' _ is a bold departure from
her Republican rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign hopes to lend some substance to her education plank
today with a policy speech in Melrose, Mass., where she was an
11th-grade student teacher while she was studying for a master's
degree in education at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I don't understand why the media doesn't quite get
it, that you don't leave the Red Cross and have a full-fledged
organization up and running the next day,'' Dole said, with a trace
of irritation, last week.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of impatience with the pace of her campaign has followed
her long after her departure from the nonpartisan organization,
however. After her boost in Iowa, she took a 10-day vacation _ in
New Hampshire, of all places _ which added to the perception that
she was squandering an opportunity to make headway.
</P>
<P>
   Some supporters say the deliberate pace comes in part from an
urge to achieve consensus before moving ahead. In ``Unlimited
Partners,'' Dole admits to a ``tendency to overprepare,'' which
also shows in this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But as a political wife, she has had more experience with the
rhythm of a presidential campaign than any of her rivals, possibly
excepting Pat Buchanan. And with her frequent references to the
young girls who tell her they wanted to be the first woman
president, Dole signals an awareness that she is making history
with her race, and feels an obligation to run it all the way.

<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ Emerging from a squinty-eyed,
head-pounding, kill-me-now hangover from the worst game of his
professional career, Steve Young came as close as he gets to being
fighting mad.
</P>
<P>
   Mad at himself for playing so poorly, at his teammates for not
playing much better and at Hurricane Floyd for not dropping in on
Jacksonville sooner so the whole mess of an opening game could be
postponed until March or canceled outright.
</P>
<P>
   They played 15 games in 1987, after all, and still crowned a
champion at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the 49ers absorbed a 41-3 thrashing by the Jacksonville
Jaguars that was still very much with them on Wednesday as they
began preparations for Sunday's home opener against the New Orleans
Saints.
</P>
<P>
   Right now Young has the worst passer rating in the league by
far. It's a figure that looks more like a clocking in the high
hurdles than a way to rate quarterbacks _ 14.3. Even
jerk-for-the-ages Ryan Leaf managed a 39.0 in his disaster of a
rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Young's quarterback rating, which is only 83.3
points below his career average, the NFL's weekly sheaf of
statistics shows the 49ers to be 28th in the league in total
offense, down 27 spots from their No. 1 ranking of last year, and
tied for last in the crucial category of turnover differential at
minus-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's got to be a passion for football,'' Young said. ``I'm
not sure this team (has) the passion to play football, 49er style.
We need to be able to do so every week, starting on Sunday. We
didn't play with the passion we needed to play with (at
Jacksonville).''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Mariucci, perhaps the most affable coach in the NFL, took
exception to Young's lack-of-passion statement. In fact, he swatted
the entire subject back to his quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask him. I don't know what he's talking about,'' Mariucci
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first time I've heard that ever from Steve. I
didn't see it that way. I thought we came out to play, indicative
of the first half. We weren't playing well on offense but we were
playing hard. The defense came to play . . . I don't understand the
(lack of) passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Young blamed himself for being rusty at Jacksonville, saying,
``I did not take care of my end. It's got to be gone now. It's been
a long couple days. There are rough days out there in the NFL.
You've got to clench your jaw and go at it for 15 weeks. You need
to see that mind- set from everybody on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   After one very bad week, it's fair to question whether the
chemistry on this team is tonic or toxic or something else
entirely. Twenty-one players who were on the roster for the
season-ending playoff defeat to Atlanta last Jan. 9 are no longer
with the 49ers, including good guys and leaders such as Merton
Hanks, Kirk Scrafford, Irv Smith, Randy Kirk, Terry Kirby, Chris
Doleman and Ty Detmer.
</P>
<P>
   In their place are newly minted 49ers like Charlie Garner, Mark
McMillian, Marvin Washington, Jeff Garcia and Lawrence Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so many new guys,'' Mariucci said. ``I think the
chemistry is going to be developed as we go. Every day there are
new guys. Guys are not tight and don't know each other. That
requires some time. Chemistry doesn't happen overnight. You got to
go through the ups and downs of a season, then you develop
chemistry as you go.''
</P>
<P>
   In the coming weeks, the 49ers need to know if Lance Schulters
is there to stay as the starting free safety; if R.W. McQuarters,
the team's No. 1 draft pick from 1998, can be a starting
cornerback; if Gabe Wilkins can be a force at defensive end; if
oldster Charles Haley and youngster Chike Okeafor can rush the
quarterback like dogs chasing a man in sirloin slacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, change can be good, to get some fresh talent,
younger talent, who can be young 49ers and contribute,'' the coach
said. ``All these young guys, we see bright futures for. They've
been thrown to the wolves. They've got to do it now.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we tell these kids in camp is we're going to play with
rookies but we can't play like rookies. You're going to have
growing pains. You're going to have a learning curve.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now the learning curve is steep. According to the starting
quarterback, the work should be undertaken with passion _ even if
the head coach doesn't know what he's talking about.

<P>
   MET-EGYPT-EXHIBIT (New York) _ A major show of Old Kingdom art,
now at the Metropolitan, easily gets the early vote for blockbuster
of the fall season. Organized at the museum by Dorothea Arnold and
handsomely installed, it's one of those spectacles, like the
Byzantine, Chinese and Mexican surveys that the Met has done in
recent years, that is not just about art but about a whole
civilization. It examines the first great epoch in Egypt, the 500
years from 2650 B.C. to 2150 B.C., which is really the high point
of all ancient Egyptian culture, when the pyramids were built and
the canon of Egyptian art was established. As well as any show, it
demonstrates why Egyptian art still holds an incredible fascination
in the West. By Michael Kimmelman.
</P>
<P>
   APPLES-SANTA-FE (Santa Fe, N.M.) _ ``The City Different,'' they
like to call it, and that it is, a heady blend of Hispanic, Native
American and Anglo cultures, with a brisk topping up, these last
few decades, of new money, big money, from Texas, California and
New York. By R.W. Apple Jr.

<P>
   COWARD-CENTENNIAL (New York) _ Noel Coward, the playwright,
actor, composer, fiction writer and cabaret star who would have
turned 100 on Dec. 16, did indeed love being attractive. It was an
essential part of his art, and in his later years he could never
understand the young actors who made a point of looking unkempt.
Star quality, as the critic Kenneth Tynan wrote, was Coward's Holy
Grail, a trait of which he said happily, ``I don't know what it is,
but I know I've got it.'' And to allow stellar light to dim or
tarnish was to him a grave act of irresponsibility. The
celebrations surrounding the Coward centennial this fall, which
range from film and television festivals to New York productions of
two of his late works (``Waiting in the Wings,'' ``Noel Coward in
Two Keys''), bear witness to the staying power of this impeccably
maintained persona. They also speak of the stamina of a man who
entered show business as an 11-year-old child actor and never
really left it until his death in 1973, refusing to let his public
image sag even as his critical and popular reputations yo-yoed
exasperatingly. By Ben Brantley.

North Carolina's coastline has been battered this decade, with two

the Outer Banks and what state and federal officials are saying
about what changes may need to be made regarding insurance,

   FLOYD-BAHAMAS _ (DATELINE TO COME), Bahamas _ The remote islands
of the Bahamas suffered widespread damage as a result of Hurricane
Floyd. The loss of communications in the hardest-hit areas has

some of these distant islands. (Williams, Cox News Service). 30.

the electricity is out and you're in a dead area and nowhere near a
cell tower. Technology keeps advancing to new heights with
cellphones and Palm Pilots and digital two-way beepers, but when a
hurricane hits, it's still best to have a transitor radio. (Husted,

<P>
   SHOOTING-BUSH _ FORT WORTH, Texas _ Saying there is ``wave of
evil'' sweeping the country, GOP presidential front-runner George
W. Bush cut short a campaign trip to Michigan to fly home and offer
what comfort he could to the victims of the church shooting and
their families. The visit and the incident pose potential political
problems for Gov. Bush: the visit because it opens him to charges
of political opportunism and the incident because it puts the
spotlight on his views about gun rights. (Herman, Austin
American-Statesman) 20.

   SHOOTING-GUNS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The Fort Worth church shooting

   LIDDY-DOLE _ JACKSONVILLE _ Out the windows of the swank River
Club, the first distant signs of Hurricane Floyd were taking shape
on the horizon Monday as Elizabeth Dole and Rep. Tillie Fowler

   RUSSIA-BOMB _ MOSCOW _ A bomb planted inside a truck ripped
apart an apartment building in southern Russia early Thursday,
killing at least 17 people and wounding more than 100. It was the
fourth bomb attack on an apartment block in Russia in the past two
weeks _ attacks widely blamed
</P>

have fueled speculation in Moscow that Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin or President Boris Yeltsin could be forced to resign if the

<P>
   MEXICO-MASSIEU _ MEXICO CITY _ With a fatal overdose of Zoloft
anti-depressants, Mario Ruiz Massieu beat his rap against explosive
charges of drug trafficking involving the highest levels of the
Mexican government. Many Mexicans in this highly suspicious country
will probably forever wonder if Ruiz Massieu really took his own
life. The former Mexican drug prosecutor _ accused of accepting
drug money bribes _ was about to go to trial in the United States
in a case that could have revealed more sordid secrets of
corruption during the presidency of Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
``Death defeats justice,'' one newspaper here said of Ruiz
Massieu's suicide on Wednesday in New Jersey. (Ferriss, Cox News
Service). 25.

   MEXICO-VIRGIN _ MEXICO CITY _ The Mother of Mexico is becoming
the mother of all election squabbles. Mexico's ruling party has
filed an official elections commission complaint that its
presidential rival Vicente Fox unlawfully used this country's most
sacred religious and cultural symbol _ the Virgin of Guadalupe _
for political gain. At a recent rally Fox's children gave him a
banner of the Virgin and he unfurled it before a crowd. A strong
conservative party contender for the presidency in Mexico's July
2000 elections, Fox has since publicly said he would ``carry the
Virgin in my heart'' but leave her home when out on the campaign
trail. But Fox's rivals won't leave the issue alone. (Ferriss, Cox

nations according to risk, saying its evaluations were intended to
only ``help Americans make their own decisions'' about year-end
travel. But with Jan. 1 just 15 weeks away, U.S. tourists and
business travelers must soon decide whether to curtail overseas
travel when the year rolls over to 2000. Should U.S. companies,
such as Delta Air Lines, continue to send workers and passengers
into Moscow when the State Department says ``Y2K disruptions are
likely to occur in key sectors of electrical power, heat,
telecommunications, transportation, and financial and emergency
services'' ? (Geewax, Cox News Service). 20.

   ``Nightmare Town''
</P>
<P>
   By Dashiell Hammett
</P>
<P>
   Short fiction
</P>
<P>
   Knopf, $25
</P>
<P>
   There is, I'm told, an excellent pop music band calling itself
Dead Can Dance. What I know for certain is that Summer '99's
nickname ought to be Dead Can Write.
</P>
<P>
   So far, we've had posthumous novels by Ralph Ellison
(''Juneteenth,'' excellent) and Ernest Hemingway ``True at First
Light,'' execrable). Now we have the return of 38-years-dead
Dashiell Hammett, in the form of ``Nightmare Town,'' a collection
of whodunit yarns turned out for various crime magazines during the
'20s and '30s. The Ellison and Hemingway books have demonstrated
the kind of uneven results we can expect when the literary closets
of deceased hall-of-fame writers are dredged for any remaining
words that could be put into print and earn substantial bucks for
surviving relatives. There can be great treasures (''Juneteenth''
was a diamond-in-the-rough classic brilliantly trimmed and polished
by a gifted editor) or noxious effluvia (Hemingway while living
didn't want ``True at First Light'' published, for darned good
reason).
</P>
<P>
   ``Nightmare Town'' falls, truthfully, in between, although it's
much closer to ``Juneteenth'' than ``True at First Light.''
Hammett's writing career was meteorlike: He burned brilliantly for
a short time, then fizzled out. His considerable modern reputation
results from reader familiarity with just a few of his novels:
``The Maltese Falcon,'' of course, plus ``The Thin Man'' and
perhaps ``Red Harvest'' and ``The Glass Key.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Hammett earned his original renown with a series of
brilliantly crafted short stories for so-called mystery slicks, or
magazines. ``The Maltese Falcon,'' for instance, was reworked into
a novel after initially seeing print as a five-part magazine
serial.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after 1934 _ and Hammett lived to age 66, dying in 1961 _ no
further Hammett fiction was published in his lifetime. William
Nolan's superb introduction to ``Nightmare Town'' provides the
details. Essentially, drink and paranoia, some of the latter truly
earned (he was briefly imprisoned for refusing to provide names to
investigators during the ``Red Scare''), combined to dry Hammett
up. But before this personal disaster, he created absolute gems of
mystery yarns, many of which have been forgotten because they
simply weren't available for subsequent generations to read.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nightmare Town'' goes a long way toward correcting this
literary misstep. Samuel (never ``Sam'' to his creator) Spade fans
will rejoice in three tales featuring their hero. The title story
is the longest, and it evokes the nonstop shoot-'em-up gore-fest of
``Red Harvest.'' Best of all, though, we get lots of visits from
the Continental Op, Hammett's alter ego based on the author's
experiences as a Pinkerton detective. The Op, never otherwise
identified, is a nondescript agent for hire who is interested only
in the satisfactory conclusions of his assigned cases. He is the
model on which all subsequent hard-boiled fictional sleuths have
been based. Hammett thought up the first one, and the best one.
</P>
<P>
   There are some clinkers in the collection, although their
presence is pretty much predictable. ``Ruffian's Wife,'' told from
the distaff perspective, isn't as clever as Nolan's
otherwise-distinguished notes would have readers believe.
``Nightmare Town'' lists into slapstick at some points, although
its unusual drive-into-the-distance conclusion saves the overall
story.
</P>
<P>
   But Hammett, who wanted his stories to combine complexity and
gritty realism, wrote so much on the literary edge that he was
bound to fall off once in a while. ``Nightmare Town's'' failings
can at least be attributed to ambition, not indifference. And when
Hammett is on, when he has his characters and dialogue rolling, he
frankly mesmerizes.
</P>
<P>
   So ``Nightmare Town'' should be classifed as a must-read,
whether you enjoy reading the modern-day mysteries of Cornwell and
Kellerman, Evanovich and Parker, or else simply want to appreciate
the stylings of a master. Hammett is acknowledged as the finest
mystery writer ever, but that is because he chose to write
mysteries. Later on, in the dregs of his career, he tried
``straight'' fiction and failed miserably, never producing a novel
worth publishing. But had he turned his attention to that genre at
the height of his powers, we might now be ranking him with Ellison
and Hemingway as simply a great writer. Read ``Nightmare Town,''
and you'll understand why.

IT'S TIME TO GIVE SOFT MONEY A HARD TIME (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Personally, I prefer hard cash.
</P>
<P>
   I almost said that the first time someone threw the term ``soft
money'' at me. Not knowing at the time that the person was
referring to a way of contributing to political campaigns, I
supposed he was talking about paper tender of the realm that had
through repeated exchange lost its crispness, or such
representations of wealth as stocks, bonds or Treasury Bills.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is my belief that millions of Americans are still
clueless about what politicians, pundits and other advocates for or
against it are talking about when they discuss soft do-re-mi. And
for that reason, those citizens may not grasp the importance of
this week's vote in the U.S. House of Representatives on the
Shays-Meehan campaign finance reform bill.
</P>
<P>
   That bill _ sponsored by Reps. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and
Marty Meehan, D-Mass. _ among other things would prohibit the soft
stuff _ i.e., large, unregulated contributions from corporations,
wealthy individuals, labor unions and other groups to the political
parties, ostensibly for ``party-building'' purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Huge amounts of that ``soft money,'' through various
subterfuges, wind up being used in the campaigns of individual
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lot like laundering illegally obtained money. In fact,
that's a good way for those who are just beginning to pay attention
to the recurring debate over campaign finance reform to get a
handle on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   More than $260 million was laundered into the campaigns of the
presidential and congressional candidates three years ago. And
leading up to the 2000 elections, contributions to the parties are
reported to be almost double what they were at this point in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Those seeking to stop the political money laundering assert that
it corrupts the political process, subverts public policy in
crucial areas, dilutes the credibility of Congress and the
executive branch, and contributes to public disillusionment and
voter apathy.
</P>
<P>
   They have hit the nail square on the noggin. There is a strong
correlation between declining voter participation and the growing
perception that elected representatives are for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most politicians aren't, or at least don't want to be,
for sale. But they know, realistically, that they must be
continuously on the make for campaign funds to pay for the TV time
they must buy to get elected and then re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, therein lies the crux of the problem. Most voters do
get their strongest impressions of the candidates from the
television ads that interrupt the programs they are trying to
watch. Although the unwanted intrusions into voters' viewing
provide little useful information, they can have a cumulative
effect upon the viewer that works to the benefit of the candidates
who run the most ads.
</P>
<P>
   Something clearly needs to be done to break the bondage of
candidates to television. But that's wishful thinking. For now,
doing something to curtail political money-laundering would help
immensely.
</P>
<P>
   Banning soft money and that other form of laundering called
``issue advertising,'' which is also prescribed by Shays-Meehan,
would not, of course, eliminate the stench of money from political
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In his bid for the presidency, Texas Gov. George W. Bush appears
to be touting his ability to raise campaign money as the primary
reason why he should be elected _ either that, or he is trying to
scare off other challengers by letting them know that he can buy
more time to insult TV viewers' intelligence than they can.
</P>
<P>
   But at least Bush is raising the money himself. And since that
``hard money'' goes directly to him, some significant restrictions
attach to his taking it, and he must make known where any
contribution over $200 comes from.
</P>
<P>
   Concern about political money laundering is no respecter of
parties. Fifty-four Republicans defied their party leadership and
voted for Shays-Meehan, which passed by a vote of 252-177.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there are those who say that the Senate version of
it _ sponsored by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Russell D.
Feingold, D-Wis. _ will again be talked to death in the upper
house. Although there were enough votes in the Senate to pass it
last year, backers could not muster the necessary 60 votes to end
the filibuster ordered by the Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   That unfortunate bit of recent history, however, need not
necessarily repeat itself. Minds can be changed if enough voters
will phone, fax, write and let their senators know that they are
disgusted with political money-laundering.
</P>

BOOK RAILS AGAINST E-COMMERCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Beware the evil engines of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   That's the message Internet expert Douglas Rushkoff is bringing
to Silicon Valley _ the birthplace of e-commerce _ to promote his
new book, ``Coercion: Why We Listen to What `They' Say.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Coercion'' is a studied rant against public relations,
marketing, promotions, professional sports and other forms of hype.
But the pages that are getting the most buzz are the ones railing
against e-commerce, the burgeoning online industry that promises to
be the digital version of the industrial revolution.
</P>
<P>
   One valley trade publication has already labeled the book the
``Blair Witch Project'' of the e-commerce industry.
</P>
<P>
   Rushkoff, who has made a living writing Internet books
(``Cyberia: Life in the Trenches of Hyperspace'' and ``Media Rant!:
Hidden Agendas in Popular Culture''), just smiles when he hears
about that reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK,'' said the hyperkinetic, 38-year-old New York
University professor. ``E-commerce is, at its heart, a legal Ponzi
scheme and a remorseless selling machine which threatens to destroy
more than it could ever create.''
</P>
<P>
   Rushkoff's arguments: E-commerce is really the automated
manifestation of tried-and-true marketing techniques.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in ``pacing and leading,'' retailers have
traditionally sold products by learning customers' preferences
through focus groups and surveys (the ``pacing'') and then using
that information to steer buyers toward similar products
(``leading'').
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, e-commerce sites collect streams of data on
customers and constantly suggest similar but different buys.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, for instance, regularly offers recommendations of
books that a user may be interested in, based on past selections.
</P>
<P>
   These techniques, Rushkoff points out, are constant and
automatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how many books you buy on Amazon, there's always
more titles being suggested,'' said Rushkoff. ``There's no human
hand on the throttle. E-commerce customers become rats on a wheel.
The machines never get tired of trying to sell us something.''
</P>
<P>
   Rushkoff saves his more scathing criticism for the e-commerce
industry itself.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, he argues, e-commerce is similar to the scheme
dreamed up by Charles Ponzi: Early e-commerce investors, such as
venture capitalists, make their profits by luring later investors _
such as Internet stock buyers _ into the e-commerce industry.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, because no real profits are being made, these later
investors are left holding the bag. Or, in this case, worthless
stocks of profitless online retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-commerce is an economic hack,'' said Rushkoff. ``E-commerce
sites aren't there to make money. They're there to be
advertisements for investment dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce, Rushkoff declares, threatens to leave us with a
heavily commercialized Internet that is best at creating anxiety,
alienation and, in the end, financial ruin for late-coming
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an Internet drained of fun,'' he said. ``A medium devoid
of a basic humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Rushkoff is an e-commerce critic, he is also a
beneficiary. His book, published by Riverhead Books, zoomed to No.
5 on Amazon's daily bestseller list after its debut (it's currently
No. 937).
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I shouldn't use Amazon as an example so much,''
Rushkoff said, sheepishly. ``They've been very good to me.''

 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Mourning the mass killings at a Baptist church in
Fort Worth, Texas, Attorney General Janet Reno said Thursday that
``such events cry out for America to come together'' and deal with
the tough issues of guns, mental illness and hate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1999 alone, we have watched as innocent people were gunned
down while attending school, while walking home from a church or
synagogue, while playing at a summer camp, while working in their
offices, while delivering mail, and now while worshipping in their
church,'' Reno recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thought of gunfire in a place of worship should be
inconceivable. But for families, for others, last night the
inconceivable became a reality,'' lamented the attorney general at
her weekly press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Reno opened the session with a statement about the nation's
latest mass killing -- when a gunman identified as Larry Gene
Ashbrook burst into a church service for teen-agers and started
shooting. Seven people were killed and seven others wounded before
the gunman killed himself.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the FBI was helping local law enforcement agencies in
Texas but for now ``we have many more questions than answers about
last night's tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   However, she supported the Clinton administration contention
that one of the long-range answers to prevent such tragedies is for
Congress to enact federal restrictions on handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that people would look not just at what handguns
have done to America this year, not in the context of this case,
but what handguns have done to America over the last many years,
and that this nation would listen to its people, who again and
again cry out ... asking government to make sure that we take
reasonable steps to ensure that guns are not placed in the hands of
people who are not lawfully entitled to have them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly random and inexplicable nature of this shooting
and earlier ones at a Colorado high school and Atlanta office
building complicate efforts at prevention, Reno indicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't prevent every crime, and we know that,'' she said.
``But, are there warning signals? Could some step have been taken?
What could have been done at an earlier age? If it's hate, how did
hate become a factor in this person's life? Is it mental illness?
What precipitated that? What could have been done? Could treatment
have been available? What are the laws? How can they be improved?
These are the questions that we should be asking.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement agencies are right asking questions in the Fort
Worth shooting, she said. And answers should be found before blame
is assigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is important that we find out exactly what
happened, what the weapon was, how it was purchased or how it came
into his hands, and take whatever steps are appropriate,'' Reno
said. ``But I would stress that right now we should just find out
what happened and why.''

VOLVO V40 RETAINS SAFETY, BUT NO PLODDING NATURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Certain cars generate a public buzz, not just before they hit
the showrooms, but before they even get into the hands of lucky
souls like me, who get to test drive them.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the Audi TT and the Toyota Tundra pickup truck rolled
in accompanied by that buzz. There is a great anticipatory buzz
over the imminent appearance of the Honda S2000, a two-seater with
an engine that buzzes like a hornet.
</P>
<P>
   And there has been much buzzing over a car that has just hit
showrooms, the so-called ``cheap'' Volvo _ cheap as in inexpensive,
not poorly made _ if you consider base prices of $22,900 (S40
sedan) and $23,900 (V40 wagon) to be cheap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will it really be a Volvo?'' many folks have asked me.
</P>
<P>
   So when I first approached the V40 a few days back, I did what
any fine-tuned expert wanting to check out the quality of a car
would do _ I opened each door and slammed it. Ca-chunk. Solid,
hefty, and sounded very much like a Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a big car _ think midsize Honda or small Audi and
you've got it about right. The wagon, in fact, reminds me more of a
slightly larger version of a GT hatchback than a true wagon. Holds
four comfortably, can hold five, and has decent space behind the
back seats.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the 40s are rounded and sleek in a way that marks a
continuation of the departure (as evidenced in the C70 convertible
or the S80 sedan) away from the heavy box we knew and loved as the
old Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   Add the surprising midrange zip of its turbocharged,
four-cylinder engine, and you've got a veritable sprite emerging
from the cocoon of clunk.
</P>
<P>
   At the high end, the V40 will go up against wagons from Audi and
BMW; at the lower end, it has Hondas and Subarus in its sights.
</P>
<P>
   You get one choice of engine: a 1.9-liter, tubocharged, DOHC,
16-valve, inline four-cylinder, but it is plenty for a car this
size. Enough juice, in fact, that in a car this light, you ask
about safety.
</P>
<P>
   Safety?
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it's a Volvo. Front and side airbags are standard. They
react to the strength and angle of any impact. The front seats are
hinged and bracketed to move on impact and absorb its force, even
as the headrests move to cradle the head and prevent whiplash.
</P>
<P>
   Not all safety related, but also standard in the 40s are
air-conditioning, heated electric mirrors, a cassette-radio, power
windows, remote locks, cruise control, and ABS. You pay extra (in
this case up to almost $6,000 extra) for leather seats, sunroof,
power seats, and other amenities. Nice touches, but if you want a
truly cheap Volvo, you don't need them.
</P>
<P>
   With the leather package, there is a fine hint of luxury to the
car. Slip into the front seats and their support is sturdy, aided
by electric adjustment, particularly firming them up beneath the
thighs. Rear seat room is cramped for three adults and fine for
two, providing the front-seat passengers do not have to move their
seats way back.
</P>
<P>
   Gauges are organized efficiently along the dash: all light
switches to the left of the wheel, climate controls at top center,
audio below them. There is no searching for buttons or switches
once you familiarize yourself with the car. Between the front seats
you find the switch that lets you choose between summer and winter
driving conditions (part of an $850 weather package), the control
for the outside mirrors, and controls for the electric windows.
</P>
<P>
   The main instrument panel, arched like a single eyebrow, is
simple and easily read behind the wheel. A trip computer ($250)
warns of icing conditions, lets you preset your speed limit and
gives an audio warning when you exceed it, and provides current
fuel consumption rate, average fuel consumption, average speed,
ambient temperature, a trip meter, and miles to go before you run
out of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a car for large families _ a couple with two small
children or people with no children who like to go antiquing or
camping on weekends would find it perfect.
</P>
<P>
   The rear seats fold down in two sections, and the front
passenger seat folds for long loads. The 33.5 cubic feet of cargo
space behind the rear seats can be covered with a cargo net.
</P>
<P>
   Easily accessible storage space for small items is limited to
small bins in each door, a small bin between the seats and, if you
get the leather package, nifty pockets on the front of each front
seat.
</P>
<P>
   On the road, the V40 was quiet, quick, and nimble.
</P>
<P>
   It will not scream away from traffic lights and the
four-cylinder lags if you try to do this. But between around 1,900
and 4,700 rpms, the turbo kicks in and gives the car a strong surge
for passing. It's a perfect compromise for those who want the fuel
economy (just over 25 miles per gallon in this test) of a small
engine, but who don't want to be left out there hanging as they try
to pass a big truck in two-way traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Its four-wheel, independent suspension _ struts up front,
multilink suspension in the rear _ is a bit stiff on bumpy roads,
but gives the upside of sure-footedness in highway maneuvers and
firm cornering on tight country lanes.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Swedes might not want to hear this, it feels more
like a fine and tight Japanese car than the safe but plodding Volvo
of old.
</P>
<P>
   Four-wheel, 14-inch vacuum-assist disc brakes, aided by ABS, are
more than enough to bring the V40's 3,040 pounds, plus passengers,
to quick, straight stops.
</P>
<P>
   So is this a Volvo?
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely, though in the sense that even as you say that
towering Mark McGuire is a ballplayer, so too is the Red Sox
diminutive Donnie Sadler.
</P>
<P>
   Nice Touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The in-dash cup holder is the best I've seen. It adjusts to
the diameter of the can, cup, or bottle that is inserted into it.
What a concept!
</P>
<P>
   --The luggage belt in the rear compartment that pulls out like a
seat belt and wraps snugly around suitcases and other gear to hold
them in place.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The outside mirrors are too small _ I could see only the lower
half of the tires of big trucks coming up on me _ and given the
wide pillars that block much of the view to the rear, this is not a
good thing.
</P>
<P>
   --The speaker system could be better, especially the rear
speakers.
</P>
<P>

long-throw dimmer stick I've ever encountered.

COMPLICATION EMOTIONS ABOUT THE CLOSING OF A GUN STORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Yet another family business is closing in San
Francisco, but it isn't just another business. There won't ever be
a store like this in San Francisco again, just as stagecoaches
never again will carry banks' money.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Gun Exchange on Second Street is having a
going-out-of-business sale, only partly because of California's new
gun laws. It's a personal decision by owners Beth and Bob Posner,
who inherited the 52-year-old store from their father, the late
Nate Posner.
</P>
<P>
   A sign in their window says, ``Over the years many of you have
become like family. Some of you represent the third generation of
our customers. We will miss you.''
</P>
<P>
   California's new ``junk gun'' law isn't well-defined, and the
Posners don't know which guns in their inventory will be
categorized as junk, so they're playing it safe by selling them
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big stores will suffer more from these laws than the
little dealers because they have a bigger inventory,'' said Bob
Posner. Incidentally, because of its old-fashioned design, the
Model 1911 Colt that served in four wars will be considered a junk
gun.
</P>
<P>
   After Littleton, there's not a lot of room in America for
sentimentality about guns.
</P>
<P>
   Another new law will limit gun purchases to one a month, but
puts the responsibility for enforcement on buyers and dealers.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good time to get out of the gun business, even though the
passage of those laws has sent gun sales through the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Now that every gun at the store has been marked down, they will
be selling as fast as the store's computers can interface with
state computers in the state capital in Sacramento _ which isn't
very fast.
</P>
<P>
   If anything has driven the Posners out of business, it's the
sheer amount of paperwork involved in selling guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be nice to have a social life again,'' said Bob Posner.
</P>
<P>
   I got to know the Posners five years ago when the Board of
Supervisors passed a special tax on guns sold in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   I thought it was political posturing at the expense of the only
large gun store in the city. Ironically, the Gun Exchange served
local cops and didn't deal in cheap guns. It also equipped
generations of San Franciscans with expensive shotguns.
</P>
<P>
   The store is finally going away. Now residents will have to
drive a few miles to South San Francisco to get a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the thing I discovered as a bleeding-heart member of the
media who befriended the owners of a gun store. Bob and Beth Posner
are great people, former '60s types who once had unruly hair, and
are tolerant in their attitudes toward everyone except those who
would ban guns.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Posner prides herself on being pro-choice, pro-free speech
and pro-gun. She sees no inconsistency. ``The Second Amendment is
what backs up the First Amendment,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   I entered the store as a typical liberal. Five years later I'm
still a typical liberal, but have a greater understanding of both
San Francisco and a gun culture that are disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice if all the guns in America disappeared, but I
don't think that'll happen soon.
</P>
<P>
   The Gun Exchange has been like a lunch-hour club for cops,
assistant DA's, and a lot of people who remind me of my outdoorsman
Maine grandfather. In modern-day San Francisco, he'd be considered
a mass murderer of Bambi's family.
</P>
<P>
   I could drop in at the Gun Exchange and pick up some dirt on
someone, and get a whiff of gun oil and the lost culture of Field &AMP;
Stream I knew as a lad.
</P>
<P>
   As an L.L. Bean type of guy, I love the trappings of that
culture, so I bought belts made by the craftsmen at Mulholland
Brothers of Potrero Hill, and a Randall knife made by the famous
knife makers in Orlando, Fla., who were the subject of my first
feature story when I was a reporter at the Orlando Sentinel.
</P>
<P>
   At the Gun Exchange I also would see the diversity of people in
San Francisco who own guns, but don't talk about it. Nowadays being
a target shooter is worse than being a heroin addict, or even a
politician.
</P>
<P>
   There always was an abundance of good cop gossip, and stories
from the guys in the diminishing working class of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Posner always had great items, like the one about all the
government bureaucracies that use excess funds at the end of the
fiscal year to buy holsters and cleaning rods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary how many people are legally carrying guns on the
streets of San Francisco,'' Posner once told me. ``Even the General
Services Administration, which takes care of desks, has personnel
who carry guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Posner is similarly nervous that the fear of Y2K has caused the
Smith &AMP; Hawken set to buy the products of Smith &AMP; Wesson.
</P>
<P>
   There are far too many guns in America, and you can applaud the
closing of a gun store if you want. But a lot of people, especially
San Francisco cops, will miss the Posners' store.
</P>
<P>
   This is San Francisco, and the end of gun stores is as
inevitable as the end of smoking in bars.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, Bob Posner ate a hamburger while sitting on a
case of marked-down ammunition. ``Maybe I'll start a politically
incorrect department store,'' he said wryly. ``I can sell furs,
cigars and red meat.''
</P>
<P>
   All those things are more acceptable than guns. The problem is,
the wrong gun dealers are quitting the business. The Posners are
leaving what has basically been their home for their entire lives.
If you think that will save other people's lives, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   But the guys who sell their goods from trunks of cars will still
be around.

ROMANCE GOES `INCOGNITO' IN THIS THRILLER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The made-for-TV movie ``Incognito'' is billed as a heavy-duty
romantic suspense thriller but is as lightweight as air. It centers
on a female insurance executive being stalked by a nut case who
raped her after she saw him gun down a woman at point-blank range.
</P>
<P>
   Released from jail on the dreaded ``technicality,'' the
psychopath, named Scanlon and played by a grunting Phil Morris,
orbits Erin Cortland (Allison Dean), showing up at her office, her
house, in the elevator of her office building, pretty much
unaccosted by the police.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Erin's wealthy father, played by Ron Glass, (Barney
Miller) hires a bodyguard.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Hunter (Richard T. Jones) is soft-spoken and charming and
carries a rather large gun. It's a given that Jake and Erin first
squabble over his protective services (she wants space; space can
get her killed, he warns), come to a truce, and then fall for each
other. But even that is clumsily handled by scriptwriter Shirley
Pierce and director Julie Dash, who stage so few scenes leading up
to an intimate interlude that it seems forced.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the chemistry between the two leads is so lacking that
by the credits, I wondered whether Erin and Jake would just go
their separate ways, never to speak again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incognito,'' which will air Friday, is the first of 10
original films adapted from the popular Arabesque line of
African-American romance novels, and this first choice certainly
has the heroic melodrama and woman-in-jeopardy silliness that, for
whatever reason, are requirements of the genre.
</P>
<P>
   What makes it different from a Judith Krantz or Danielle Steel _
besides its paltry $850,000 budget _ is that the leads and the
majority of workers populating the plush insurance company owned by
Erin's family are black.
</P>
<P>
   Race and money aside, ``Incognito'' runs into the same problems
as Steel offerings. In trying to give a love affair depth and
context, the film is weighed down by too many other elements. Here
it's a subplot that involves Erin's fiance, an opportunist who may
or may not be stealing from the insurance company. That, along with
the terrifying Scanlon, was a bit much to keep track of. Dash wants
to hand us a twist on an old theme, but it inadvertently keeps the
romance and thriller sides from ever meshing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incognito'' also squandered any opportunities to explore
wealth, class and privilege among a racial group usually shown as
monolithic. Jake's idea of a safe house was the modest home he
shares with his sister (Vanessa Williams) in the low-rent district
of Los Angeles. Other than her question of ``Why are we in South
Central?'' Erin seemed rather at home there.
</P>
<P>
   Dean, who attended Southern Methodist University in Dallas, does
a serviceable job as the terrified heroine. Jones, a terrific actor
who was a regular on the short-lived drama series ``Brooklyn
South,'' does what he can, despite having to mutter silly machoisms
(''He's a technofreak with a bad chip on his shoulder,'' he barked
about Scanlon), playing Jake as a sensitive soul who cooks fish.
</P>
<P>
   Morris must have jumped at the chance to play the bad seed. Here
he embodies someone who is not middle-class and refined, (even his
zany ``Seinfeld'' character was a lawyer), a man teetering on the
brink of violent madness.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, in a setting in which the terror literally kills the
romance, he must have seen his role as something of an actor's
playground.

PERFECT GIFTS FROM GOD COME IN ALL SHAPES, SIZES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A friend of mine recently shared with me part of a conversation
he had with a nun.
</P>
<P>
   He told me he'd been particularly struck by her vow of poverty
and by how that allowed her a certain freedom _ from financial
woes, specifically.
</P>
<P>
   I told him that you don't have to be a nun to find freedom from
financial cares. All one needs, really, is faith that God is
all-powerful, all-knowing and means exactly what he says.
</P>
<P>
   I then rattled off a few Scriptures _ ``be anxious for nothing,
I came that they might have life and have it abundantly, lay aside
every weight'' _ related to the subject.
</P>
<P>
   He was quiet. Not sure what to make of the silence, I kept
talking. I told him that I was speaking from experience, that I've
never been without what I needed. Sometimes I have had to wait for
the things I want, but I get those things as well.
</P>
<P>
   It had been the same way growing up in Mississippi with nine
siblings and very little money.
</P>
<P>
   Now. Two things. First, this is not an attempt to discourage
anyone from becoming a nun. Second, from here on out I will refer
to my God as Christ. That does not mean I don't recognize that
there are other religions.
</P>
<P>
   But it does mean that I believe having Christ and his word
within me puts me on the road to freedom, not only in my finances
but in my will, intellect, emotions, family, job, relationships and
future, and that without him, my life would be a mess.
</P>
<P>
   The way I see it, Christ's freedom is liberation of the soul. It
can be enjoyed not just in a monastery, but behind prison walls or
in the midst of injustice.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's a lot harder to believe if your trust is based
totally on sight and circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   But as is often the case when I share my faith with someone, God
will test my words to see _ or rather for me to see _ if I'm simply
giving lip service or if I really mean what I say.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the child in my life who's always teaching me something:
Jamila.
</P>
<P>
   We were on our way to a piano recital shortly after I spouted
off with my friend. Jamila and Asha were in the back seat talking
about all the things that make our family rich.
</P>
<P>
   Being the good mommy that I am, I piped up to share with my
little darlings the real deal. In my most soothing voice _ I didn't
want them to go into convulsions _ I said, ``Hey guys, we're not
rich.''
</P>
<P>
   In disbelief, Jamila shot back, ``Mama, H-E-L-L-O!''
</P>
<P>
   As in, how stupid can you be, woman?
</P>
<P>
   I craned my neck to look back at her, and as is normally the
case, she's waving her little hands to help drive home her point,
to school her poor mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean God,'' she said. ``Rich in God.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, I wanted to disappear. I was so embarrassed, I thought if
I ever got pregnant again _ which isn't likely _ but if by some
miracle I did, I will never again read Scripture aloud to my fetus.
</P>
<P>
   I'm convinced that this is why this child is so spiritually
minded.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, I was immediately reminded of my conversation with
my friend and all my talk about blessings and peace of mind,
Christ's gifts to those who trust in him.
</P>
<P>
   And so I had to ask myself, ``Do I really believe all good and
perfect gifts come from God, that he will supply all of my needs,
or was I simply paying him lip service?''
</P>
<P>
   I remembered this from Matthew 15:8 _ ``This people draweth nigh
unto me with their mouth, and honoreth me with their lips, but
their heart is far away from me.''
</P>
<P>
   God has made many wonderful promises toward us. It's nice to be
able to repeat them, but how many of them do we really believe?
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, how often do we live like it?

CREATIONISTS ARE BUGGING HIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ I can't get these creationists out of my face.
</P>
<P>
   They've been at me, off and on, for weeks now with letters and
e-mails and phone calls. Some are bright and thoughtful _ although
wrong. Others are angry and utterly uninformed in their wrongness.
</P>
<P>
   They're all disturbed over a column I wrote a few weeks back,
after the Kansas State Board of Education essentially removed the
teaching of evolution from the state's school curriculum. I said in
that column that evolution is the foundation of modern biology. I
said that people who interpret literally the spontaneous creation
described in the Book of Genesis shouldn't try to write their
religious beliefs into law _ not in a country where the First
Amendment empowers citizens to reject such beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   I also noted that most people have no problem reconciling the
process of evolution with faith in a supreme creator who set the
mechanism in motion. That view is referred to by the more
thoughtful creationists as ``theistic evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   They dislike it almost as much as athiests dislike it. And I've
heard from a mob of them, too.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that column went out to hundreds of newspapers across
North America. So, not only am I hearing from angry local
creationists, I've been swamped with outraged communications from
far-away places. One guy from the Akron, Ohio, area got me live on
the phone. He was beside himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why we can't teach creationism in the public
schools,'' he fumed. ``They teach religion now. But the religion
they teach is humanism.''
</P>
<P>
   I rplied: ```That's not a religion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it is. Humanism confers godlike status on human beings.
That's a religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Nope. Humanism is a philosophy that says that we ought to treat
another decently because it's the right thing to do. I don't know
the extent to which the concept of treating each other with
kindness is promulgated in the public schools, but a religion it
isn't. I've spent 30 years working on English language newspapers.
Words _ like religion, for instance _ have specific meanings.
</P>
<P>
   I asked him if he had a dictionary handy. Fortunately, he did.
Look up religion, I suggested. Then I asked him: What does it say?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' he told me, ``it says that religion is concern over
what exists beyond the visible world. It says that it's different
from philosophy in that religion operates through faith or
intuition rather than reason and that it generally includes the
belief in a supreme being or a group of spiritual beings that
either created the world or have the power to influence the world's
events.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right,'' I said. ``What else does it say?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It says that religion is the belief that prayer or ritual or
living by certain principles of everyday life can bring you reward
in an afterlife, and that ignoring those things can bring you
punishment in the afterlife.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, does humanism meet that definition?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't want the schools teaching evolution,'' he
replied. ``It's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Evolution is a theory, I told him. ``That's defined by my
dictionary as a coherent explanation for observed data. You're
entitled to reject the theory. What you're not entitled to do is to
tell me that my kids can't be exposed to widely accepted scientific
theories that you reject on religious grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want the truth taught,'' he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   So, I grabbed my dictionary and read him the definition of
truth. It's defined as ``a verified or indisputable fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Reluctantly, he agreed that neither evolution nor creationism
meets that definition. Which means that this guy's next move might
be to try to have another subject removed from the public school
curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I suppose, we can kiss English goodbye.
</P>

HEALTH EXPERTS REMIND YOUNGSTERS TO PLAY SAFE, AVOID INJURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The last thing Nicholas Russell, 14, thinks about
when he plays football or hockey is getting injured. ``We always
stretch a lot before practice, and we always make sure we have the
right equipment,'' said Russell of Ballston Spa, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Yet each year, thousands of children under the age of 15 end up
in the emergency room because of sports injuries, from concussions
to broken bones.
</P>
<P>
   As the school year gets under way, health experts are reminding
young athletes, their coaches and parents to play it safe,
especially during the start of the fall sports season when many
injuries, such as pulled muscles, are more apt to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's critical that student athletes and everyone else
participating in sports have a proper warm-up period with a few
minutes of stretching before engaging in any sports activity,''
said Dr. Lynne T. Nicholson, department chief of physical medicine
and rehabilitation at Sunnyview Hospital in Schenectady, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   That advice is especially important for athletes under 15
because their growing bodies are more susceptible to certain
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are marked differences in coordination, strength and
stamina between children and adults,'' Nicholson said. ``In young
athletes, bone-tendon-muscle units, which are growth areas within
the bones and ligaments, experience uneven growth patterns, leaving
them susceptible to injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Hutchins, athletic trainer at Albany Academy here, said the
most common problems include pulled hamstrings and shinsplints, a
painful condition caused by irritation of the fibrous membrane
surrounding the shinbone, or the front part of the leg above the
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Runners and anyone else who puts in a lot of miles on hard
pavements or tracks without shock-absorbing footwear, are
vulnerable. To minimize symptoms, trainers often use tape or ice.
In severe cases, the best solution is rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of kids will come in after the summer and they're
potentially out of shape for the amount of work they do in
practice,'' Hutchins said.
</P>
<P>
   He and many other school coaches and trainers try to keep
students active over the summer with suggested training schedules.
For those students who don't follow through, the challenge for
Hutchins is trying to encourage them to pace themselves and to
allow plenty of time for stretching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody likes it,'' Hutchins said about stretching. ``It's a
constant battle for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only can stretching minimize the risk of shinsplints and
pulled muscles, but improved flexibility can boost speed,
coordination and strength.
</P>
<P>
   Russell, a ninth-grader at Saratoga Springs Junior High School,
has learned that lesson firsthand over the years.``I don't mind
it,'' he said. ``If it helps, I'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides taking the time to warm up and cool down, Nicholson
offers these tips to help prevent common injuries:
</P>
<P>
   _ Use the proper equipment: Make sure your shoes are designed
for the activity you plan to use them for. Be prepared to replace
shoes as they wear out. Running in a pair of poorly made shoes may
also cause discomfort and injury. Always wear appropriate gear,
including helmets, padding and mouth guards.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't force the body: If an activity doesn't feel comfortable,
it may be because of improper technique. An incorrect foot plant or
stride can lead to ankle or other injuries. Learn proper form or
technique for optimum safety and performance, and don't overdo it.
Get treatment for a persistent sharp or sudden pain that occurs
during athletic activity, Nicholson said. ``If ignored, a mild
injury can become serious. For instance, untreated tendinitis can
lead to a torn tendon, a much more complicated injury that will
sideline an athlete for weeks or months.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Get rest and relaxation: Even professional athletes take a day
off. At least once a week, give the body a rest. Besides stretching
and warming up, Russell spends time off the athletic field keeping
his body healthy during the sports season.``I try to eat well, I
take vitamins every day, and stay away from junk food,'' he said.

 &HT;    BUSINESSES FACE TOUGH Y2K DECISIONS ABROAD
 &HT;    780&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Last Tuesday, when the State Department assessed
how well other countries are preparing for Y2K computer problems,
it refused to rank nations according to risk, saying its
evaluations were intended to ``help Americans make their own
decisions'' about year-end travel.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Jan. 1 just 15 weeks away, business owners soon will
have to make those determinations. For example, should they have
workers in frigid Russia at the darkest time of the year when the
State Department says Y2K disruptions there ``are likely to occur
in key sectors of electrical power, heat, telecommunications,
transportation, and financial and emergency services?''
</P>
<P>
   So far, no major companies have announced plans to cut business
ties with Russia or other northern-latitude countries with
vulnerabilities to the software flaw.
</P>
<P>
   Cargill, a Minnesota-based commodity giant, stirred up a
controversy in South Africa recently when it said it would avoid
doing businesses there from Dec. 15 to Jan. 15.
</P>
<P>
   In coming weeks, more U.S. companies may make announcements
about curtailing global operations because of Y2K worries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have plans to discontinue service (to Moscow).
However, we are realistic,'' said Kip Smith, spokesman for Delta
Air Lines. ``We know this is a complex situation, so we are, of
course, making contingency plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Those plans ultimately may include canceling Delta flights. ``We
are still collecting a lot of information from different places ...
so we can make wise decisions about our service and our people,''
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K bug can cause older programs to misunderstand dates
starting with Jan. 1, 2000. It has the potential to trigger
malfunctions in the equipment used to generate power, control air
traffic, deliver water, track billing and much more.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, so many tens of billions of dollars have
been spent by companies and government agencies to correct the
problem that mainstream experts no longer expect catastrophic
failures of basic services.
</P>
<P>
   But the State Department's assessments of 196 nations suggest
the outlook is less optimistic for many countries. For example, the
State Department says that in Venezuela, ``it appears that there is
a moderate risk of disruption in the electric power sector, which
could have implications for all other local sectors.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, there's a fairly good chance the lights will go
out for some indefinite period, which could mean the banks won't
open, hospitals will be chaotic and so on. Meanwhile, Ford Motor
Co. has a huge plant in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Whether to continue operating such a plant with the help of
backup generators would be a judgment call ``based on safety and
security,'' said Ford spokeswoman Kathleen Vokes. If employees
would be safer at home than trying to get to work on darkened
streets, they will be allowed to be absent, she said.
</P>
<P>
   At least the Venezuelans who face Y2K disruptions would be able
to ride out the difficulties with the help of family and friends.
But what about American workers who might be far from loved ones
during massive service disruptions? Those are the very employees
least likely to be given leave from their posts because they will
be needed to monitor operations and execute contingency plans.
</P>
<P>
   At duPont, the Delaware-based chemical company with operations
in more than 70 countries, expatriate managers have not been
requesting leaves of absence, nor has the company been offering
any, said Cinda(cq) Hallman, senior vice president. ``We have no
wholesale plans to bring expats home, because we don't see the need
for that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hallman said plant managers in foreign countries often face
power outages, phone failures and other difficulties. ``Many of
them have been in situations where they have been in floods, fires
and earthquakes,'' she noted.
</P>
<P>
   But while plant managers in Third World countries may have the
most experience with disruptions, it will be their counterparts in
the relatively advanced countries of Eastern Europe who may face
the roughest time.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Wednesday to a House subcommittee dealing with Y2K
issues, David Jhirad, a senior advisor at the U.S. Department of
Energy, said the combination of frigid winters and poor Y2K
planning have increased the likelihood that Russia and other
Eastern European countries will experience dangerous conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Jhirad said a loss of electricity in Russia could trigger a
breakdown in the transmission of natural gas to neighboring
countries. Without power, Russian compressors could not move gas
along to customers who need it to keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Among the businesses most concerned about Y2K are travel
agencies, cruise ships, hotel chains and others in the hospitality
industry. They are counting on customers to take expensive trips to
foreign countries. So far, Y2K concerns have not caused massive
cancellations of global celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not being overly cautious at all,'' said Nalina
Prasad, of Prasad and Associates, a Toronto-based travel agency
specializing in ``millennium tours'' to exotic locations such as
Fiji and Egypt. ``People see this as a once-in-a-lifetime thing ...
so they just aren't worrying about it.''

SCI-FI WRITERS TALK ABOUT THEIR CRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL GRONDAHL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DELMAR, N.Y. _ On a quiet suburban side street in a nondescript
white bungalow, veteran science fiction authors George Zebrowski
and Pamela Sargent have transformed their modest home into a
formidable writing factory.
</P>
<P>
   He plants himself in a cramped, book-lined study in the front of
the house, and she is rooted at a computer in a book-stuffed office
in the back of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Anchoring the isthmus between the partners' writerly spaces is a
spare bedroom overrun with thousands of scientific reference books.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes about 100 of those reference books to make one
science fiction novel,'' said Zebrowski, 53, author of dozens of
novels and short stories in the genre. ``You've got to research
cutting-edge science to write a cutting-edge science fiction
novel.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple, who have never married, met in 1964 as philosophy
students at the State University at Binghamton, N.Y. They started
living together in 1970 and both have supported themselves as
full-time writers ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we put our income together, it's a solid middle-class
living,'' said Zebrowski, whose speech still carries the Bronx
accent of his youth.
</P>
<P>
   They left Binghamton after three decades and moved to Delmar in
1996, in part to be close to Sargent's family. Even after three
years in their Delmar home, they're still unpacking some of the
hundreds of boxes of books that filled three moving trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like moving an institution,'' said Zebrowski, a man
with a sweep of gray hair and a pronounced limp from a childhood
hip defect that could not be repaired despite two series of
surgeries that hospitalized him for many months as a boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Private tragedies,'' Zebrowski said with a dismissive wave of
a cane. ``Everyone has them.''
</P>
<P>
   The two writers share their book-saturated house with a minimum
of furnishings and a 16-year-old black-and-white cat named Spencer
(after Spencer Tracy). On days when the writing is going well and
Sargent is able to summon all of her creative energies to construct
alternative histories and imagine societies of the future, she is
not conscious of Zebrowski's typing a mere 40 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get lost in my work and forget he's there,'' she said. ``I
sit down at my computer in the morning and the next thing I know,
it's evening.''
</P>
<P>
   During those writing blitzkriegs, Sargent has completed the
draft of a novel in as little as 10 weeks. Although Zebrowski
sticks almost exclusively to the SF genre, Sargent has branched out
into historical fiction, including an epic novel about Genghis Khan
titled ``Ruler of The Sky.''
</P>
<P>
   That 1993 novel barely registered on the U.S. publishing radar,
but it made Sargent something of a short-lived literary celebrity
in Spain and earned her an advance from a German publisher three
times as large as any of her novels in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Sargent said she moves easily between the past and the future in
her work. ``In a way, science fiction and historical novels require
a similar craft,'' she said. ``They're both period pieces about a
time and culture that are not mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Zebrowski knows firsthand the fickle publishing world, too. His
acclaimed 1979 SF novel, ``Macrolife,'' sold fewer than 5,000
copies in hardcover in the U.S. But sales in its European editions
were much stronger. In all, the 35 books Zebrowski has written or
edited have been published in more than six languages.
</P>
<P>
   The partners occasionally collaborate on writing projects,
including write-for-hire books in the Star Trek series. They don't
read each other's works-in-progress, but when a manuscript has gone
through several rewrites, they pass it across the house and become
initial editors. They are tough on each other's prose. Then it's
back to the computer keyboard in their respective offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``All writing is rewriting,'' Zebrowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Zebrowski and Sargent have won critical acclaim, major
literary prizes and a devoted readership within the insular world
of science fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real small club and everyone knows each other,'' said
Zebrowski, noting there are about 1,200 members of the Science
Fiction Writers of America. Zebrowski and Sargent have been
co-editors of that group's newsletter, The SFWA Bulletin.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the Albany, N.Y. region's literary circles, the pair
remain largely unknown. ``It's that notion of prophets being
strangers in their own land,'' Zebrowski said.
</P>
<P>
   The fiftyish Sargent, who declines to give her precise age,
thinks her anonymity locally has to do in part with the fact that
she is a self-described ``painfully shy'' person who avoids public
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just not comfortable doing an author tour and the
marketing part of writing,'' said Sargent, in a baggy black
T-shirt, a mane of dark hair and thick eyeglasses, who makes
occasional eye contact with a visitor.
</P>
<P>
   Zebrowski will appear at several local book signings in the fall
to promote his latest novel, ``Cave of Stars'' (HarperPrism, $24).
The story is set in 2331, on the fourth planet of Tau Ceti. Humans
abandoned the dying planet Earth hundreds of years earlier in
starship arks. They traveled to distant stars and planets like Tau
Ceti IV and live in macrolife mobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Zebrowski received the 1999 John W. Campbell Memorial Award for
science fiction from the Center for the Study of Science Fiction at
the University of Kansas. He was honored for his novel ``Brute
Orbits.'' Previous winners of the prestigious award include Arthur
C. Clarke, Ursula K. LeGuin, Kingsley Amis, Philip K. Dick and Kurt
Vonnegut Jr.

KEVIN COSTNER PULLS OFF HIS THIRD BASEBALL MOVIE, `FOR LOVE OF THE
GAME' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The movie star career of Kevin Costner, as everyone knows, has
been on a downward spiral since his 1990 Oscar triumph, ``Dances
With Wolves.'' He's spent most of the decade since making a series
of legendary, ego-driven flops, and one sappy romance.
</P>
<P>
   So a certain air of desperation hangs over ``For Love of the
Game,'' his last film of the waning decade he once threatened to
own _ especially since it's a baseball movie, a genre he would seem
to have milked dry with his two '80s hits, ``Bull Durham'' and
``Field of Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   But, amazingly, he pulls off this third trip to the well.
Despite a creaky moment or two, it's an entertaining star vehicle
that works as both an engrossing competition movie and a poignant
love story. With a little luck, it could be just the big hit
Costner needs to jumpstart his career.
</P>
<P>
   He plays Billy Chapel, the 40-year-old star pitcher of the
Detroit Tigers, who is having the worst day of his life: his
girlfriend (Kelly Preston) is leaving him, the team he's served for
18 years is being sold, he's being traded to the Giants, and his
arm is killing him.
</P>
<P>
   When he goes out to face the mercilessly jeering fans at a
season-ending game in Yankee Stadium, he can't help but tune out
his surroundings and look back on his career, and on the course of
his failed relationship _ which we see dramatized in periodic
flashbacks.
</P>
<P>
   As the game proceeds, Billy is so lost in his memories that he
doesn't notice that none of the hated Yankees are getting on base,
and that he's gradually building himself a perfect game _ so that,
suddenly, he has the opportunity to rejuvenate his career, or
retire in glory.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball fans will note the movie is hardly an accurate picture
of the state of our troubled national pastime. At one point, the
Tigers owner (Brian Cox) tells Billy that this game they have given
so much now ``stinks'' but the script never begins to tell us why.
</P>
<P>
   It also conveniently omits the things in Billy's life that might
distance us from his plight _ no mention of multi-million-dollar
salaries or palatial Florida estates. As depicted here, he lives
out of a suitcase and is as pure and unsullied by big money as Roy
Hobbs, Joe DiMaggio or Casey at the Bat.
</P>
<P>
   But if you can forgive this artistic sleight of hand, the movie
goes down like a cool glass of lemonade on a hot day. Director Sam
Raimi not only captures all the thrill of the game at its best, he
manages to keep the movie's romantic and athletic elements almost
perfectly balanced.
</P>
<P>
   As a romance, he gets a lot of help from Kelly Preston, who has
finally risen from the starlet class, and comes perilously close to
walking away with the movie. She creates a character of real depth
and substance: not just long-suffering and beautiful, but curiously
flawed and uncannily resourceful.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's Costner's vehicle, and he carries it with a
gimmick-free performance that emphasizes all his best qualities as
a star: an endearing masculine charm, a skillful underplaying of
almost every scene and a willingness to be, at times, infuriatingly
human.
</P>
<P>
   For Love of the Game. Directed by Sam Raimi. Screenplay by Dana
Stevens, from the novel by Michael Shaara. Cast: Kevin Costner,
Kelly Preston, John C. Reilly, Jena Malone, Brian Cox, Vin Scully.
Universal. 137 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sexual references.

   Grade: B+

 &HT;    BUSINESSES FACE TOUGH Y2K DECISIONS ABROAD
 &HT;    780&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Last Tuesday, when the State Department assessed
how well other countries are preparing for Y2K computer problems,
it refused to rank nations according to risk, saying its
evaluations were intended to ``help Americans make their own
decisions'' about year-end travel.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Jan. 1 just 15 weeks away, business owners soon will
have to make those determinations. For example, should they have
workers in frigid Russia at the darkest time of the year when the
State Department says Y2K disruptions there ``are likely to occur
in key sectors of electrical power, heat, telecommunications,
transportation, and financial and emergency services?''
</P>
<P>
   So far, no major companies have announced plans to cut business
ties with Russia or other northern-latitude countries with
vulnerabilities to the software flaw.
</P>
<P>
   Cargill, a Minnesota-based commodity giant, stirred up a
controversy in South Africa recently when it said it would avoid
doing businesses there from Dec. 15 to Jan. 15.
</P>
<P>
   In coming weeks, more U.S. companies may make announcements
about curtailing global operations because of Y2K worries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have plans to discontinue service (to Moscow).
However, we are realistic,'' said Kip Smith, spokesman for Delta
Air Lines. ``We know this is a complex situation, so we are, of
course, making contingency plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Those plans ultimately may include canceling Delta flights. ``We
are still collecting a lot of information from different places ...
so we can make wise decisions about our service and our people,''
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K bug can cause older programs to misunderstand dates
starting with Jan. 1, 2000. It has the potential to trigger
malfunctions in the equipment used to generate power, control air
traffic, deliver water, track billing and much more.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, so many tens of billions of dollars have
been spent by companies and government agencies to correct the
problem that mainstream experts no longer expect catastrophic
failures of basic services.
</P>
<P>
   But the State Department's assessments of 196 nations suggest
the outlook is less optimistic for many countries. For example, the
State Department says that in Venezuela, ``it appears that there is
a moderate risk of disruption in the electric power sector, which
could have implications for all other local sectors.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, there's a fairly good chance the lights will go
out for some indefinite period, which could mean the banks won't
open, hospitals will be chaotic and so on. Meanwhile, Ford Motor
Co. has a huge plant in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Whether to continue operating such a plant with the help of
backup generators would be a judgment call ``based on safety and
security,'' said Ford spokeswoman Kathleen Vokes. If employees
would be safer at home than trying to get to work on darkened
streets, they will be allowed to be absent, she said.
</P>
<P>
   At least the Venezuelans who face Y2K disruptions would be able
to ride out the difficulties with the help of family and friends.
But what about American workers who might be far from loved ones
during massive service disruptions? Those are the very employees
least likely to be given leave from their posts because they will
be needed to monitor operations and execute contingency plans.
</P>
<P>
   At duPont, the Delaware-based chemical company with operations
in more than 70 countries, expatriate managers have not been
requesting leaves of absence, nor has the company been offering
any, said Cinda(cq) Hallman, senior vice president. ``We have no
wholesale plans to bring expats home, because we don't see the need
for that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hallman said plant managers in foreign countries often face
power outages, phone failures and other difficulties. ``Many of
them have been in situations where they have been

 &HT;    `Big Trouble' yields big laughs in Dave Barry's debut novel
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 19.
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two dumb-as-a-stump lowlifes named Snake and Eddie have
unwittingly managed to get their hands on a nuclear bomb in a
suitcase, smuggled out of the former Soviet Union, and are about to
take it through the metal detector at Miami International Airport.
Clean-cut high school students are running around Coconut Grove
playing a game called ``Killer,'' in which they stalk one another
at night with squirt guns. The Miami police and the FBI are
stumbling over each other, and the hero, such as he is, is a former
newspaper reporter barely surviving with his own ad agency.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds more like one of Carl Hiaasen's comic Florida noir
thrillers than the work of Pulitzer Prize-winning funny-guy
columnist Dave Barry, and it is more like Hiaasen. ``Big Trouble,''
Barry's first novel, is obviously deeply indebted to Hiaasen's
pioneering warped work in what Barry, in his introduction, calls
``The Bunch of South Florida Wackos genre.''
</P>
<P>
   Hiaasen, a columnist at The Miami Herald along with Barry,
obviously bears his friend no ill will for having copied his
loose-but-clever plot structures so closely. He's given Barry a
big-time blurb on the book jacket, as have old Barry chums Stephen
King and Elmore Leonard. This is known in publishing as
``log-rolling,'' in which simpatico fellow authors all join hands
and sing ``That's What Friends Are For.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, however, the cover blurbs are correct: ``Big
Trouble'' is a very funny novel, with more laughs per chapter than
most of Barry's 20 or so nonfiction books, some of which seem to
have been written on auto-pilot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Trouble'' involves a large cast of characters who start at
vastly different points and end up influencing, arresting, killing
or lusting after one another. There's Eliot, who was fired from his
newspaper after trashing his editor's office (a fantasy staple of
the journalist-turned-novelist); his teenage son Matt, who's
involved in the game of Killer; Arthur Herk, a mean, corrupt,
alcoholic developer (the only kind in Miami-based thrillers); John
and Leo, formerly Ivan and Leonid, the Russian arms smugglers;
Walter the too-macho cop; and Roger the dog, ``the random result of
generations of hasty, unplanned dog sex,'' who has ``the
intelligence of celery'' but a crucial role at several plot turns.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone gets pretty much their just desserts. The Justice
Department may not always live up to its name, but an omnipotent
novelist can hand out rewards and punishments in a fitting way, and
Barry does.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, ``Big Trouble'' is Barry's poison-tipped valentine
to his adopted city of Miami, to its poly-ethnic stew, its heavily
armed population and its Borgia-like politics. Publishing would be
better off if Barry wrote less ``Dave Barry Turns 40, Does Japan,
etc.'' and wrote more novels like ``Big Trouble.''

 &HT;    Frustrated clerk takes wheel on a road trip through `Hell'
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept.19.
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Ridley's ``Everybody Smokes in Hell'' is the best B-movie
you'll read this season. It's a headlong dive through a world
inhabited by the kind of jazzy, jivey lowlifes that Elmore Leonard
and Quentin Tarantino might team up to put on film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell'' is an amusing hybrid: Sometimes it reads, sometimes it
unreels. It all centers on Paris Scott, a workaday night-shift
clerk at an L.A. convenience store. Paris is a black, frustrated
daydreamer who's been dumped by the most beautiful woman he's ever
known. Leaving his lousy job one night, what appears to be a
scraggly white street person, half passed out against Paris' '74
Gremlin, asks Paris to take him home.
</P>
<P>
   In another book or movie, Paris would kick the guy aside and
drive off. End of book. End of movie. In the manner of this sort of
high pulp fiction, however, Paris worries about the karmic
consequences of such an act and drives the guy home, ``a way, like
a gambler's ritual, of keeping more trouble out of his already
troubled existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that tossed-off act changes the course of Paris'
life. It veers from a flat-lined Nowheresville to a careening,
episodic ... movie that suddenly runs through the worlds of rock
stars and music execs and gangstas, along with the preening,
cut-rate flotsam those worlds attract. Drugs, sex and violence are
merely a geography through which everyone navigates.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Score becomes the only motivation, and not getting dead
the only strategy to getting there. Ridley, who's written both for
film and TV (``Martin'') and published two previous novels (``Love
Is a Racket,'' ``Stray Dogs''), is in joyful command of this
out-of-control world.
</P>
<P>
   Each page is fueled by the standard bag of caper-novel tricks,
executed with a fresh voice and a sure hand. There's run-on
observation (``The girl behind the counter was nineteen and white
trash distilled to its purest form: uncontaminated, unaffected,
undetrashified by the many and various ethnicities in the city
she'd migrated to.''). Nodding dialogue of the profoundly
air-headed (``You writing a script? You going to photograph models?
What's the angle now? What are you almost going to do with your
life?'') Dumb-luck/bad-luck plot twists. And an unending collection
of characters that includes the most sadistic female bad guy you
ever wished you'd never met.
</P>
<P>
   It's Ridley's gift to love everyone he creates, good or evil,
and allow them to turn disgusting or venal or sweet of their own
free will. It's what elevates his pulp fiction to ``Pulp Fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   There are times when the book's pretense of biding time until it
becomes a movie grows tiresome; it turns lazy in ways that are
surprising from an author whose imagination is otherwise so
righteously hyperactive (one chapter begins: INT. VIDEO STORE _
MORNING; toward the end, some chapters are reduced to a few
sentences).
</P>
<P>
   And as is true of even the best caper fiction _ even Leonard's _
things wrap up a little too handily here, as if the writer is being
paid for a certain number of pages, and once that quota is reached,
everything must end.
</P>
<P>
   But those are not the kind of quibbles you should apply to a
book whose strength is the thrill one gets from its imperfect,
don't-look-back energy. ``Hell'' is a vivid, outrageously unpretty
joy ride that feels like it can be read in a minute, or watched in
an hour and a half. Read it soon at a theater near you.

 &HT;    Music you can really dance to
 &HT;    By Shane Harrison
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Moby is a vegan who admits a fascination with
pornography. He's a Christian, a descendant of Herman Melville
(hence the nickname) and has disavowed monogamy (``I'm incapable of
sustained romantic involvement. It's a brain dysfunction of mine,''
he said in a 1997 online chat). He has remixed artists as diverse
as Michael Jackson and Metallica. He's either a mass of
contradictions or the perfect postmodern Renaissance man. He's also
an unpredictable and prodigiously talented musician and sonic
architect.
</P>
<P>
   Moby, born Richard Melville Hall, was raised in Connecticut and
makes his home in New York, where he crafts dance music of shining
beauty and pumping authority. He's also an in-demand remixer and
producer, having worked with remixed Metallica and Ozzy Osbourne,
and having turned down production offers from Guns N' Roses and
Hole.
</P>
<P>
   Filling dance floors in 1991 with the percolating ``Go,'' Moby
was the techno/dance world's artist most likely to cross over into
the mainstream. Following several more singles, he released
``Everything Is Wrong'' in 1995, a remarkable distillation of his
work to that point. It was Spin magazine's album of the year and
showed up on Top 10 lists in Entertainment Weekly, The Village
Voice, Rolling Stone and many more publications. Then, perversely,
at a time when America's music press was trumpeting electronic
dance music as the next big thing, Moby released ``Animal Rights,''
a guitar-heavy grab bag that alienated a good chunk of his fan
base.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the 34-year-old artist released what may well be his
finest album to date. ``Play'' finds him pushing the edge of
electronic dance music once again. Many of the tracks use a
cappella field recordings by archivist Alan Lomax of Deep South
African-American blues and gospel singers.
</P>
<P>
   In his review in Spin, Charles Aaron wrote, ``To hear an
electronic dance album looking backward as intently as it dreams
forward is a real-time joy, and Moby rides the groove with a buzz
reminiscent of his early swirling techno anthems `Go' and `Ah
Ah.''' The magazine further lauded Moby's efforts when ``Play''
gained the No. 20 spot on its list of the 90 best albums of the
'90s.
</P>
<P>
   This fall finds Moby branching out into another realm: playing
fashion model in a Calvin Klein ad campaign. ``The only reason I
did it was because a bunch of my friends who were musicians were
doing it,'' he said. ``I thought that if they were OK with it, then
I'd do it. My one condition is that they don't try to make me look
sexy. If I tried to look sexy, I'd just end up looking like an
idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   When not doing fashion shoots, Moby is keeping up with a massive
tour schedule. He and his band have been on the road for two months
and will be gigging until after New Year's Day. He says he enjoys
the touring, though. ``Especially right now. It's summertime and
the shows are going well _ almost every show has been sold out.
It's great when the record's doing well and I'm on a label (V2)
that's very supportive. When the record isn't doing well and ticket
sales are slow, then it can be a drag.''
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, he's playing on a bill with bands with which he has
little in common; in fact, he sticks out like a frat boy at a Cher
concert. He's used to it, though, having played quite a few similar
shows on this tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just did one in Buffalo,'' he recalls, ``and there are
about 10 bands on the bill, and I can't tell them apart. When you
have four white guys onstage with guitars, they start to sound the
same after a while. I also had the distinction of being the only
one who didn't yell, `Show us your (breasts)' from the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   His much-discussed Christianity isn't much like the version
you'll find at your local Baptist church. In an essay he wrote for
the ``Everything Is Wrong'' album, Moby said that ``conservative
Christian values are these _ humility, mercy, compassion, love,
honesty, etc. Nowhere in the Bible does Christ encourage his
followers to be intolerant, greedy bigots.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of five thoughtful and expressive short essays in the
``Play'' CD booklet, Moby writes that ``fundamentalism (of any
kind) troubles me. The world is too big and too intricate to
conform to our ideas of what it should be like.''
</P>
<P>
   In much the same way as our world, Moby's music is
unpredictable, constantly evolving and changing, defying
expectations in the most delightful ways.
</P>
<P>
   Moby will also perform a free show at midnight tonight at
Cobalt, 265 E. Paces Ferry Road N.E. 404-760-9250.

 &HT;    Kronos program a tale of tape, tango, global works
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Kronos Quartet fears nothing but fear itself.
</P>
<P>
   The eclectic program it will play Saturday at Emory University
(Ga.) is standard with this cutting-edge group. The composers
include:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Americans Steve Reich and Terry Riley. Reich's ``Triple
Quartet,'' written for Kronos, features the live quartet playing
against two tape recordings of itself. Riley's ``Requiem for Adam''
was written for the son of founding violinist David Harrington. The
boy died at age 16.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rezso Seress of Hungary, whose ``Gloomy Sunday,'' written in
1933 after the suicide of his lover, spawned a wave of copycat
suicides. (At one point, the British Broadcasting Corp. banned its
broadcast.) The arrangement for Kronos is by Argentine composer
Osvaldo Golijov and is based on the sound of a Hungarian Gypsy
band.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Anibal Carmelo Troilo of Argentina, the great bandoneonista
who inspired the late Astor Piazzolla in his virtuoso tango
compositions.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Franghiz Ali-Zadeh of Azerbaijan, who uses traditional Central
Asian material in her compositions. ``Oasis'' is from her ``Silk
Road'' cycle.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rahul Dev Burman of India, best known for his film scores.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Aleksandra Vrebalov of Yugoslavia. Already a prize-winning
composer at 29, Vrebalov wrote ``Panonia Boundless'' as an ode to
freedom. Panonia is the ancient Roman name for the plains of
Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   The major work on the program is the Quartet No. 2 of Alfred
Schnittke, the finest composer of the latter Soviet era, who died
last year at 65.
</P>
<P>
   Kronos watchers will note a new face in the foursome. Longtime
cellist Joan Jeanrenaud took a leave of absence last year and was
replaced by Jennifer Culp. Now Jeanrenaud has made her departure
permanent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wear and tear of 20 years is certainly part of that,''
said Harrington, the only charter member left in the group. Violist
Hank Dutt joined the quartet in 1977, second violin John Sherba in
1978. Culp has the honor of being not only the youngest but also
the only San Franciscan in the San Francisco-based ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   While Kronos is at Emory, another eminent American quartet is at
Spivey Hall. The Emerson String Quartet will be playing more
standard fare: two Haydn quartets (``Quinten'' and ``Lark''),
Shostakovich's Quartet No. 14 and Samuel Barber's popular ``Adagio
for Strings.''
</P>
<P>
   Audience participation
</P>
<P>
   It's not often that the audience's voice is heard in a concert
(except when composers include ambient sound in their work). But
the audience gets quite a voice in the last event of NextFest, a
new-music weekend at Emory.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Craig Hultgren, 44, cellist with the contemporary
music ensemble Thamyris, sent out a search party for new works for
solo cello. The harvest of his work takes place Sunday. From more
than 110 submissions from composers in 12 countries, a panel of
judges chose eight works:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``With Love'' for cello, prepared tape and decorated cello
cases (1986) by Vivian Adelberg Rudow, 63, of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Incantation I'' for amplified cello and computer-generated
tape (1994) by C. Matthew Burtner, 29, a fellow at Stanford
University's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Fast Music'' (1994) by Don Freund, 52, a professor at
Indiana University, who wrote the piece for the Japanese virtuoso
cellist Tsuyoshi Tsutsumi.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Artist and His Model'' by Charles Norman Mason, 44, who
teaches at Birmingham Southern College and wrote the piece for
Hultgren.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Parallax 2 `Apparitions,''' fine lines for cello and tape
(1992) by Paul Rudy, 37, University of Missouri/Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Pizzicato'' (1996) by Arthur Jarvinen, 43, California
Institute of the Arts. The piece, written for his wife, Lynn
Angebranndt, imitates the use of the left hand by players of the
guitar and electric bass. The cellist dispenses with the bow
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Garland'' for cello and video (1991) by Robert Carl, 45,
Hartt School of Music, University of Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Pipeline Burst Cache'' for cello and tape (1998) by Craig
Walsh, 28, University of North Carolina at Greensboro.
</P>
<P>
   Another eight compositions were selected for special mention.
Two of these are by Southern composers: ``Three Gestures'' by
Nickitas J. Demos of Georgia State University and
``drowningXnumbers'' by Dorothy Hindman of Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   The printed program for the concert includes a ballot. At the
end of the performance, ballots will be collected and tallied, and
a winner announced.
</P>
<P>
   When the program was played in Birmingham in July, Mason won and
received a $1,000 prize. The winner at Emory also will receive
$1,000. The program will be performed a third time in Mobile, Ala.,
where the winner will receive $500.

 &HT;    `Tale' has the Rohmer magicBy Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Autumn Tale'' offers something more astonishing than all the
special effects and spectacular gross-out stuff we've seen this
summer at the movies. Namely, two nice-looking women in their
mid-40s sharing a glass of wine and some good talk.
</P>
<P>
   The last of esteemed French director Eric Rohmer's ``Four
Seasons'' series (some played here, some didn't), ``Autumn Tale''
is a comedy with, as the title suggests, a bittersweet autumnal
tone. And therein lies its richness.
</P>
<P>
   The long-widowed Magali (Beatrice Romand) runs a vineyard in the
Rhone Valley. Now that her children are grown, she grudgingly
admits to her married best friend, Isabelle (Marie Riviere), ``I
need to meet a man, but I refuse to do anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a problem. Behind her back, Isabelle places a personals ad,
and then ``test drives'' the best prospect, Gerald (Alain Libolt),
by pretending to be Magali. Meanwhile, more matchmaking is afoot.
Young Rosine (Alexia Portal), who dates Magali's son, Leo, thinks
that Etienne (Didier Sander), her college professor and former
lover, would be perfect for her. Both prospects are invited to a
wedding so Magali can look them over (and vice versa) without
knowing she's being fixed up.
</P>
<P>
   Romand and Riviere, who've acted in Rohmer films of decades ago,
create indelible portraits of longtime friends who, as the somewhat
labored vineyard analogy insists, have become better with age. With
her mass of wiry jet-black hair and aging hippie wardrobe, Romand
is both earthy and vulnerable. Riviere, playing a chic bookstore
owner, exudes an endearing poise mixed with sensitivity and a
genuine caring for her friend. Even the brash, hardheaded (and
occasionally hardhearted) Portal means well.
</P>
<P>
   What's especially amusing here is how much more we learn about
the matchmakers than the matchmakee. Isabelle finds herself feeling
flirtatious with Gerald, while Rosine, though she insists she's
doing all this for Magali, seems to relish the hold she still has
over Etienne. And while theirs are decidedly secondary roles, the
men have something to play as well. Gerald is a divorced salesman
at loose ends _ ``I've lost contact with life,'' he confesses to
Isabelle. Meanwhile, Etienne, though he clearly hasn't lost his
taste for girls far too young for him, comes off as more than just
a cliched cad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Autumn Tale'' is a film full of generosity, humor and insight.
By being both sympathetic to and ironic about the simple fact that
the prospect of seeking out romance reduces all of us to cringing
adolescents, the nearly 80-year-old Rohmer imparts wisdom that's
aged to perfection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Autumn Tale''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Marie Riviere and Beatrice Romand. Directed by Eric
Rohmer. Not rated, but the theme may be too mature for children.
Subtitles. 1 hour, 52 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Ripe comic-romance wisdom presented by a master
named Eric Rohmer.

STORIES IN `THE ACID HOUSE' PROVIDE A BIT OF A GIGGLE BUT LITTLE
ELSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Will fans of ``Trainspotting'' flock to this film trilogy based
on a book of short stories by ``the poet laureate of the chemical
generation,'' Irvine Welsh?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, if they learn the rough-and-tumble Scot also wrote the
screenplay. It's tough to gauge because three years have passed
since ``Trainspotting,'' Danny Boyle's hallucinogenic parable of
drugged out contemporary urban youth, splashed onto screens and
we've since had lots of film rip-offs that have attempted to grasp
the same darkly funny, urgent look at ``choosing life'' _ complete
with hip, commercially inclined soundtracks.
</P>
<P>
   Director Paul McGuigan assembles a sharp cast of British and
Scottish actors. And he certainly has an inventive eye (he began as
a photographer and graduated into TV documentary) and it's not the
direction that feels flaccid in this film. Surprisingly, it's the
stories themselves, which provide a bit of a giggle but little
else. They rely on quirkiness and schoolboy puerility to garner
their laughs.
</P>
<P>
   The first segment, ``The Granton Star Cause,'' and the last,
``The Acid House,'' are smug and self-serving stories about losers
who wind up glorified by circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Granton Star Cause,'' soccer player Boab Coyle (Stephen
McCole) is having a bad day. His teammates have sacked him, his
girl has dumped him and his parents have kicked him out so they can
have S&AMP;M sex. Even his boss has let him go. What's a guy to do?
Head to the pub, of course. But for Boab, an afternoon of drink
leads to a meeting with God (Maurice Roeves), who is fed up with
the human race and has decided to set an example with old Boab
himself.
</P>
<P>
   The second story, ``A Soft Touch'' is more effective and could
be likened to the improvisational, craggy films by Ken Loach or
Mike Leigh. It's also the most complex and truthful. A young man,
Johnny (Kevin McKidd) marries his pregnant girlfriend, Catriona
(Michelle Gomez). After their daughter is born, Johnny takes on the
role of breadwinner and parent because his wife wants nothing to do
with him.
</P>
<P>
   He's ``a soft touch,'' a caretaker of a guy who always does the
right thing despite the pain it causes. When Johnny is humiliated
by his wife's leaving him for their sleazy user of a neighbor, his
degradation is complete. He sees that he must change if he is to
avoid a dismal fate _ but can he?
</P>
<P>
   The final segment is the most prototypically Welsh. In ``The
Acid House,'' Coco Bryce (Ewen Bremner) drops a tab of acid and
runs out into a storm where he is hit by lightning simultaneously
with an ambulance carrying a posh English couple, Rory (Martin
Clunes) and Jenny (Jemma Redgrave), who have just had a child. Coco
and the infant exchange personalities _ to caustically humorous and
provocative result.
</P>
<P>
   The Acid House. Directed by Paul McGuigan. Written by Irvine
Welsh. Cast: Ewen Bremner, Kevin McKidd, Maurice Roeves, Martin
Clunes, Jemma Redgrave. Zeitgeist Films. 112 minutes. Unrated
(adults only).

 &HT;    Offbeat `Adventures' agelessly amusing
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Adventures of Sebastian Cole'' is as shaggy and unformed
as its hero's haircut. That's part of its charm. It's a
coming-of-age tale that recognizes that coming of age is an ongoing
experience that lasts long beyond adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1983, this amiably meandering comedy-drama unfolds in
upstate New York. It's there that Sebastian (Adrian Grenier)
listens with his startled sister and mother to his stepfather's
news: Hank (Clark Gregg) intends to become a woman, and he hopes
that's OK with the family.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't. The news sends mom (Margaret Colin) fleeing back to
her native England, dragging Sebastian with her, while sis heads
prematurely for college out west. But a few months later, sick of
the damp Old Country, Sebastian returns to the States. There he
moves back in with Hank, whose permed hair, earth-mother necklaces
and flowing frocks are helping him become ``Henrietta.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite these changes, this is the same person who tough-loves
Sebastian into getting up every day for school and doing his best.
He's still a loving stepdad; he's just trying to find himself. So
is Sebastian, a wily student who supplements his innate smarts with
the occasional scam or reckless stunt (such as riding his bicycle
through the high school hallways, disguised behind a ski mask). He
wants to be a writer. He's looking for experience, whether that
means drinking himself into a stupor in the parking lot of the
liquor store or going to New York and looking for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Tod Williams obviously enjoys his characters'
foibles and usually doesn't force them toward easy solutions or
revelations. Hank/Henrietta is only one of the many characters,
including Sebastian's sardonic school friends and his
on-again-off-again girlfriend (Aleksa Palladino). The film is
casually paced and takes its time, which might make some viewers
impatient. But if you're looking for a movie as interested in
texture as plot, you might give these ``Adventures'' a look.
</P>
<P>
   ``The
</P>
<P>
   Adventures of
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-

<P>
   Starring Adrian Grenier and Clark Gregg. Rated R for language,
crude sexual references and substance abuse. At Tara.
</P>

 &HT;    Kevin Costner's third baseball movie is laced with romance,
regrets and cliches
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baseball has been very, very good to Kevin Costner. ``Bull
Durham'' was funny, sexy, literate stuff. ``Field of Dreams'' still
makes grown men weep.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad that, no matter how hard it tries to hit, Costner's new
baseball romance, ``For Love of the Game,'' whiffs a lot. At two
hours-plus, it doesn't just seem long, it sometimes feels like a
double rain delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Game'' is one of Costner's better efforts in recent years. Its
dramatic end-of-season matchup of the Detroit Tigers taking on the
New York Yankees packs more punch than ``The Postman''; its
off-field love story musters more sexual heat than ``Robin Hood:
Prince of Thieves.''
</P>
<P>
   This is one date movie that plenty of audiences will cheer. Good
for them.
</P>
<P>
   Costner plays Billy Chapel, a Tigers pitching god in his waning
years whose star power might have been bigger than the game itself.
In the span of seconds, he learns first that his team is being sold
and he'll be traded, and then that his girlfriend, Jane (Kelly
Preston), is dumping him.
</P>
<P>
   Chapel heads for the mound to pitch what could be his last game.
And a doozy it is. As he nears what could be a perfect game, he
begins to think back over his life _ playing catch as a kid and
meeting Jane, wooing her, losing her (more than once) and trying to
win her back.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Costner tosses a perfect game isn't nearly as important
as whether director Sam Raimi (the ``Evil Dead'' flicks and ``A
Simple Plan'') can pull off a tricky double play _ half a movie
devoted to staging an authentic-looking baseball game, and half
dedicated to flashbacks of a believable, up-and-down he/she
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Raimi, a baseball buff, seems resolved to play it out in a
rhapsody of the most reliable sports cliches. Real-life announcers
Vin Scully and Steve Lyons (once an Atlanta Brave) show up to call
the game in their hokey, bantering style. Costner's pitches are
punctuated with ear-splitting sound swooshes. And for the
make-or-break plays, slo-mo that only Brian De Palma fans could
love.
</P>
<P>
   Costner and Preston's romance is often played just as large,
with frequent musical interludes and ``would you love me if ... ?''
moments.
</P>
<P>
   The actors generate just enough sexual chemistry to make a
convincing couple. But the real life in this movie comes from John
C. Reilly (Mark Wahlberg's porn film pal in ``Boogie Nights''). He
plays Gus Sinski, Chapel's career-long catcher. The rare times when
he's on-screen, Reilly is funny, goofy and a welcome sight.
</P>
<P>
   It's a small plus to counter ``Game's'' field of extremes.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    `Hands': Special touch of humanity
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A car dealership's publicity stunt gradually reveals itself to
be a bloodless blood sport in ``Hands on a Hard Body.'' S.R.
Bindler's riveting 1997 documentary unfolds primarily in a tent set
in the parking lot of a Nissan showroom in small-town, Texas, 125
miles east of Dallas. It's here that 23 lucky contestants, drawn at
random, meet at 7 a.m. on a Tuesday morning, jockeying to win a new
$15,000 truck.
</P>
<P>
   All they have to do is be the last one standing beside it, with
one hand touching the vehicle. No leaning. No sitting. No
squatting. No sleeping. Take your hand off the truck and you. Are.
Out.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-eight hours later, we've learned a lot about not only
the weary-eyed winner of the pickup, but the 22 who have buckled,
whether due to numb ankles and backs, exhaustion or the sort of
disorientation from sleep deprivation that sends one contestant
stumbling home in her socks in the wee hours of the morning (her
friends manage to catch up with her after three blocks).
</P>
<P>
   Among the memorable players are Benny Perkins, who presides over
the grueling marathon like a tailgate sage. Winner of the same
contest two years before, chosen to compete again, he knows the
competition is equally a matter of physical and emotional
endurance: ``It's who can maintain their sanity the longest.''
</P>
<P>
   The contestants include gawky young men, gray-haired guys and
about an equal number of women. They debate the merits of youth and
maturity in this sort of endurance test, and observers bet on who's
likely to last longest, based on their footwear, attitude and
eating habits (carbs: good; candy bars: bad). By the end of the
film, expectations have been tested, proved and just as often
upturned.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed before and during the marathon, the contestants have
different reasons for being there: the heck of it, the need for
another vehicle or a chance to sell the truck to pay off debts and
move on with their lives.
</P>
<P>
   For a woman named Norma, supported by a ``prayer chain'' at her
church, her motives are partly religious. Sustaining herself on
gospel tapes and bouts of divinely inspired laughter, she says,
``We believe in the power of prayer and the strength of the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's extremely spiritual,'' Benny observes. ``It's a little
bit scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Why Norma and her friends think the Almighty would take such a
personal interest in the disposition of a Nissan pickup is never
addressed. But that's ultimately a strength of ``Hands.'' The movie
could take the easy way out by underscoring the eccentricity and
delusions of some contestants. Instead, the more time we spend
under that tent, the more nobility and depth director-editor
Bindler finds in these people.
</P>
<P>
   As the hours lengthen, he captures the ambiguity each time a
person pulls out of the contest: After a point, these strangers
become friends, making loss and victory a communal experience. Once
the contestants dwindle to a bleary four, the movie becomes
remarkably suspenseful; you find yourself rooting for all of them.
The beauty of ``Hands'' is the ways it finds something uplifting in
this bone-wearying stunt. Director Brindler gives us a good,
salty-sweet taste of what humanity is all about.
</P>
<P>
   When one fellow drops out of the race, he returns the next day
to cheer his former competitors on. In his words, ``There's not
that many tryers in the world today.'' Whether they succeed or not,
the subjects of the movie all gain heroic stature, just for
wishing, for wanting and for trying.

 &HT;    `Twins Falls' an exercise in brotherly togetherness
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   So you've heard of identical twins being close? Brothers Michael
and Mark Polish took that idea to painful extremes when they made
``Twin Falls Idaho.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like an 18th-century corset,'' co-writer, co-star and
director Michael says of the device they wore to play conjoined
(aka ``Siamese'') twins Francis and Blake Falls. Made of fabric and
steel ribbing to simulate the movement of flesh and bone, the
girdle bound the two together from chest to legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as uncomfortable as you can imagine, but it helped with
the sweating and the anguish,'' says Michael, who plays the weaker
of the movie's brothers, Francis.
</P>
<P>
   Now playing, ``Twin Falls Idaho'' is a melancholy tale of love.
Basically a three-person drama, it shows us what happens when a
sympathetic young prostitute (Michele Hicks) meets the brothers and
finds her initial repulsion changing to compassion, then love for
one of the Falls boys.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in Northern California, Michael and Mark, 28, became
fascinated with conjoined twins after seeing a photo of the famous
19th-century circus attractions Chang and Eng Bunker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were intrigued by the notion of two people being stuck
together all the time,'' Michael says.
</P>
<P>
   With the Polish brothers (it's pronounced POE-lish), sticking
together is a choice. They wrote the script in tandem, though they
chose separate tasks when making the movie. ``I took the director's
credit because it was easier to let Mark focus on the acting,''
Michael says. ``He had to carry the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really difficult to be an actor-director. I never wanted
to do that; I never thought that's where my talents would lie. We
always wrote screenplays that would allow me to direct and Mark to
act.'' Before their feature debut with ``Falls,'' Michael was
best-known for directing the award-winning short ``Bajo del Perro
(Under the Dog),'' starring his brother.
</P>
<P>
   Working on a $500,000 budget and an airtight, 17-day shooting
schedule, the brothers realized they couldn't even take the time to
allow rehearsals for the other actors. It was largely shoot-and-go.
The two did take time to polish their work as one physical unit,
playing the guitar (Mark's right hand strumming, Michael's left on
the frets) and walking in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really are one creature,'' Michael points out. ``We
thought it would be better if they had a kind of fluidity. I think
we magnified that a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask him about his inspiration for the dank, clammy look of the
movie's interiors, and he pauses a moment, knowing where this is
going. ``Regardless of who I say my inspirations are, people always
refer to David Lynch,'' he says. ``I think he's a master filmmaker,
but our first inspiration was painting.'' In particular, he and
Mark responded most to the precisely lit canvases of Edward Hopper
and Vermeer.
</P>
<P>
   As for filmmaking influences, he cites the late Krzysztof
Kieslowski, best-known perhaps for his 1990s trilogy of linked
movies, ``Blue,'' ``White'' and ``Red.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Michael Polish says ``Twin Falls Idaho'' is the first
of three scripts he and Mark have written, with name-places for
titles. The next one they plan to shoot: ``North Fork.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about building a dam,'' he says. His words come out with
a dry sort of noncommittal tone that suggests it's about a whole
lot more. You might just as easily describe ``Twin Falls Idaho'' as
``the story of two brothers who have a close relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it turns out to be, the next film will continue the
Polish brothers' exploration of what Michael calls ``Americana.''
He says, ``I feel our work is just as American as another film,
although it's dark. I like to think that America has a lot more
diversity than just Julia Roberts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Twin Falls Idaho''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-

   Starring Mark and Michael Polish. Directed by Michael Polish.
Rated R for kinkiness and adult themes. At Tara.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 45 minutes.

   The verdict:
</P>
<P>
   An eerie and intriguing film about troubling doubles. (Eleanor

`GRAND ILLUSION,' `NORTH BY NORTHWEST' DELUXE REVIVALS IN EVERY
SENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A little over a decade ago, an eminent critic stated that, while
it was still too early to predict most of the long-term effects of
the video revolution on the movies, one thing was for sure: It
would destroy the theatrical revival business.
</P>
<P>
   Boy, did he get a wrong number. The audience for deluxe revivals
of great movies has grown steadily through the '90s. This year,
we've had a new-print, audio-enhanced, restored version of a
``Third Man,'' ``Blade Runner'' or ``Yellow Submarine'' almost
every week.
</P>
<P>
   This week, in fact, we have two re-tooled, golden oldies back on
the big screen where they belong: Jean Renior's 1937
French-language ``Grand Illusion,'' and Alfred Hitchcock's 1959
thriller, ``North By Northwest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Grand Illusion'' is a film that regularly makes the polls of
the cinema's great masterpieces. Among its many distinctions is the
fact it was the first foreign-language film to ever be nominated
for a best picture Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   It's a drama set mostly in a French and British POW camp in
Germany during World War I, and deals with the relationships
between the prisoners and their captors, and between the prisoners
themselves _ who soon team up along various class and social lines.
</P>
<P>
   The film is often called one of the great pacifist films, and,
while that may be true, it's anti-war message is extremely subtle,
and critics have debated for 50 years over what exactly the ``grand
illusion'' of the title refers to: Is it war in general, WWI in
particular or something else?
</P>
<P>
   But its story is so perfectly (and economically) told, its
characters are so rich and human and civilized, and its dialogue is
so intelligent and revealing that the film just wraps a spell
around you that's hard to describe, but impossible to forget.
</P>
<P>
   The gorgeous new print of this latest re-release of ``Grand
Illusion'' was made from the original camera negative, which was
long thought to have been destroyed in World War II, but turned up
recently in Toulouse. It's also been re-subtitled, and seems much
sharper than my memories of the older versions.
</P>
<P>
   The week's other major revival, ``North By Northwest,'' is being
shown via a new print with a restored, re-mastered soundtrack, and
was struck both to celebrate the film's 40th anniversary this year,
and last month's 100th anniversary of the birth of its director,
Alfred Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   It's an irresistible comedy-thriller staring Cary Grant as a New
York advertising man, mistaken for the target of a group of
unusually confident foreign spies, who spends most of the movie
being chased by them all over America.
</P>
<P>
   At least three sequences in this film are icons of the cinema _
Grant and co-star Eva Marie Saint hanging from Mount Rushmore,
Grant chased through a corn field by a malevolent crop-duster,
Grant and Saint making out in a train berth as the train goes into
a Freudian tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vertigo'' may be Hitchcock's most artistic film, and
``Psycho'' may be his scariest, but ``North By Northwest'' is, for
my money, his most entertaining. Ernest Lehman's script is a marvel
of wit, sophistication and unrelenting menace, and just everything
about the movie ``works.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant gives a performance that seems the summation of his
persona, Bernard Herrmann's score is his most edgy and compelling,
Robert Burks' VistaVision visuals are staged with an epic and
surreal flair, and Hitchcock found just the right tone to
crystallize these elements into a stunning genre perfection.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Adventures
</P>
<P>
   of Sebastian Cole'' R (profanity, crude sexual references,
</P>
<P>
   substance abuse)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Adrian Grenier and Clark Gregg.
</P>
<P>
   As shaggy and unformed as its hero's haircut. That's part of the
charm. Set in 1983, this amiably meandering comedy-drama unfolds in
upstate New York, where Sebastian (Adrian Grenier) listens with his
sister and mom to his stepfather's news: Hank (Clark Gregg) intends
to become a woman. Writer-director Tod Williams enjoys his
characters' foibles and doesn't force them toward easy solutions or
revelations. (SM) 1 hour, 52 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Africa's
</P>
<P>
   Elephant Kingdom'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary
</P>
<P>
   It has some eye-poppingly large pachyderms, but it isn't as
visually astounding as ``Everest.'' Still, this Imax film has its
share of lovely images, including time-lapse shots of the sun
setting on the dusty horizon and a massive storm whirling across
the plain. (SM) 40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Alaska:
</P>
<P>
   Spirit of the Wild'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Narrated by Charlton Heston.
</P>
<P>
   It's big, it's bold, it's big ... The sheer size of the latest
Imax offering sometimes makes it an eye-opening experience.
Otherwise, this visit to the far, brrr-cold reaches of our biggest
state is just another Discovery Channel-style nature flick. The
film spans millenniums _ and throws in bits and pieces about the
ice age, the Klondike Gold Rush, caribou hunting and bears. (Bob
Longino) 40 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``American Pie'' R (sexuality, sexual dialogue,
</P>
<P>
   profanity, drinking)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan and Chris Klein.
</P>
<P>
   It's a raunchy, throwaway, pre-adult, R-rated high school
sexcapade with dirty dialogue and more than one risque encounter
between students that's broadcast over the Internet. There's also
the grossest joke involving a beer you're likely ever to see on
film. Little in ``American Pie'' deserves honest laughs. (Bob
Longino) 1 hour, 35 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Autumn Tale'' Not rated, but the theme may be
</P>
<P>
   too mature for children.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Marie Riviere
</P>
<P>
   and Beatrice Romand.
</P>
<P>
   Magali (Beatrice Romand), a widowed Frenchwoman in her mid-40s,
becomes the object of matchmaking by her best friend and by the
young woman who's dating Magali's son. By being both sympathetic to
and ironic about the simple fact that seeking out romance reduces
us all to cringing adolescents, director Eric Rohmer, now almost
80, imparts wisdom that's aged to perfection. Subtitles. (ERG)1
hour, 52 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Better Than Chocolate'' Unrated, but contains nudity
</P>
<P>
   and sexual situations.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Wendy Crewson
</P>
<P>
   and Karyn Dwyer.
</P>
<P>
   A sunny but badly scattered gay romantic comedy. The Canadian
comedy follows the love lives of a group of lesbians connected to a
bookstore called Ten Percent. Full of subplots, it's hard to
actively dislike. But like a puppy, it's sloppy and hyper and badly
in need of discipline. (SM)1 hour, 43 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blair Witch Project'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Heather Donahue,
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams.
</P>
<P>
   It's a journey into the kind of terror that comes from trying to
glimpse something in the shadows just beyond the campfire. Three
students head into the woods to document an 18th-century witch
tale, then disappear. The movie wrings chills out of the slightest
effects _ odd twiglike contraptions hanging from trees, a pile of
stones, strange noises in the night _ but its power comes from
psychological intensity. (SM)1 hour, 27 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue Streak'' PG-13 (profanity, violence
</P>
<P>
   and crude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Martin Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   A decent, disposable Martin Lawrence vehicle. He's a crook
posing as a cop to recover a $17 million diamond he stashed years
ago. Basically a series of quick skits, there's enough action
scenes to mollify audiences who can't get enough of gunfire and
breaking glass. While it doesn't exactly streak along, at 93
minutes ``Blue Streak'' gets the job done. (SM)1 hour, 33 minutes.
C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Bowfinger'' PG-13 (sex-related material
</P>
<P>
   and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Steve Martin,
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Murphy and Heather Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Martin has come up with a beautiful premise for a movie.
Martin plays a hapless Hollywood producer with a stinky script and
a gem of a way to get it filmed with impossible-to-get megastar Kit
Ramsey (Eddie Murphy). ``Bowfinger's'' got a few good laughs but
not much more. Sadly, it never takes on Hollywood with the zing of
``Wag the Dog'' or ``The Player.''
</P>
<P>
   (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 37 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Chill Factor'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Cuba Gooding Jr.
</P>
<P>
   and Skeet Ulrich.
</P>
<P>
   Summer's last-gasp action movie. There's a newfound deadly
chemical substance that'll blow and snuff out millions if not kept
cold. And two bickering heroes (Skeet Ulrich and Cuba Gooding Jr.)
who must keep military hooligans away from that chemical by
stuffing it inside an ice cream truck and putting pedal to the
metal. Unfortunately, ``Chill Factor'' doesn't have enough gas to
outgun its own concept. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 40 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Blue Sea'' R (excessive gore, dismemberment)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Samuel L. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   There is precious little that is original about this movie. It
really doesn't matter, though. When the plot kicks in and the
killer shark starts prowling and munching, the film delivers all
the thrills, explosive action and sheer gore that audiences have
come to expect from the shark genre. (Hap Erstein, Cox News
Service) 1 hour, 45 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dinner Game'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   With subtitles
</P>
<P>
   Starring Thierry Lhermitte
</P>
<P>
   and Jacques Villeret.
</P>
<P>
   A feast of foolishness. A bunch of snotty Paris yuppies holds a
weekly dinner to see who can bring the biggest idiot as his guest.
Publisher Thierry Lhermitte thinks he's got a sure thing when he
meets Jacques Villeret, who builds scale-model monuments out of
matchsticks. But fate intervenes when Lhermitte throws out his back
and is forced to spend the evening with Villeret. (ERG)1 hour, 22
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Dudley Do-Right'' PG (mild comic action violence,
</P>
<P>
   profanity, innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brendan Fraser
</P>
<P>
   and Sarah Jessica Parker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dudley Do-Right'' is just plain wrongheaded. Based on one of
the weaker elements of Jay Ward's TV 'toon series ``The Bullwinkle
Show,'' this live-action takeoff has so much less to offer. Brendan
Fraser (``George of the Jungle'') plays Dudley and it's clear he'd
rather not be here. There's not one joke or one slapstick moment
that's funny. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 27 minutes (including a new
``Fractured Fairy Tales'' cartoon short). F+
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story Imax
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' (SM)44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``For Love of the Game'' PG-13 (sexual situations, profanity
</P>
<P>
   and drinking)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Costner
</P>
<P>
   and Kelly Preston.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how hard it tries to hit, Kevin Costner's new baseball
flick whiffs a lot. Costner plays Billy Chapel, a Detroit Tigers
pitching god in his waning years who first learns his team is being
sold and he'll be traded and then that his girlfriend is dumping
him. As he pitches what could be a perfect game, he flashes back
over his life. (Bob Longino)2 hours, 18 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Hands on a Hard Body'' PG (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   A documentary.
</P>
<P>
   S.R. Bindler's riveting 1997 documentary unfolds primarily in a
tent set in the parking lot of a Nissan showroom in small-town
Texas, where 23 lucky contestants jockey to win a new $15,000
truck. All they have to do is be the last one standing beside it,
with one hand touching the vehicle. The more time we spend under
that tent, the more nobility and depth director-editor Bindler
finds in these people. (SM) 1 hour, 37 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``An Ideal Husband'' PG-13 (brief nudity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Rupert Everett, Cate Blanchett, Jeremy Northam and
Julianne Moore.
</P>
<P>
   A less-than-ideal adaptation of Oscar Wilde's play. In 1895
London, a respected politician's public and private lives are
threatened by a devious blackmailer who knows a secret from his
past. The fine cast is stymied by director Oliver Parker's
literal-minded approach. What remains is a well-acted, very
well-appointed period piece that becomes more stifling and less
engaging as it goes along. (ERG) 1 hour, 37 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``In Too Deep'' R (profanity, sensuality, some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Omar Epps and LL Cool J.
</P>
<P>
   A decent undercover-cop thriller highlighted by some smart
performances. Omar Epps is quite good as the detective, but LL Cool
J is a revelation as the ruthless drug kingpin, a monster made all
the scarier by his seeming benevolent charm. (SM)1 hour, 50
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Inspector Gadget'' PG (wacky violence, profanity
</P>
<P>
   and innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Broderick
</P>
<P>
   and Rupert Everett.
</P>
<P>
   The best gag is the first one in Disney's big-screen version of
TV's popular animated part-human, part-machine, mucho-gizmo lawman.
Matthew Broderick is perfectly cast as Gadget. Rupert Everett goes
over the top as bad man Sanford Solex. Kids will enjoy watching
them both. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 20 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iron Giant'' PG (fantasy action and mild profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Aniston and Harry Connick Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Nice story for kids, nifty look for adults. In 1957, a giant
metal-eating robot crash-lands on Earth and is befriended by
9-year-old Hogarth. But the robot's trail of munched-on trucks and
grain silos attracts a super-paranoid government agent. The
interesting mix of voice talent in this animated film includes
Jennifer Aniston as Hogarth's mom and Harry Connick Jr. as a
beatnik with seductive Elvis eyes. (ERG) 1 hour, 24 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Love Stinks'' R (profanity and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring French Stewart
</P>
<P>
   and Bridgette Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   And so does this movie. Playing like a revenge fantasy from
someone stung by a real-life palimony suit, writer-director Jeff
Franklin's misogynist diatribe miscasts irritating character actor
French Stewart as a TV writer about to marry his longtime
girlfriend Chelsea (Bridgette Wilson). She's a sexy parasite; he's
equally rancid. The movie has nothing to do with love. It's about
lust, lucre and well-paid losers. (SM)1 hour, 33 minutes. D-
</P>
<P>
   ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' PG-13 (profanity, some violence
</P>
<P>
   and sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Hugh Grant, James Caan
</P>
<P>
   and Jeanne Tripplehorn.
</P>
<P>
   An effete British auctioneer (Hugh Grant) experiences culture
clash when he finds himself married to the mob, literally. Call it
a sleeping-with-the-fish-out-of-water comedy. Grant's one-trick
performance as an elegant bumbler is treadworn. He's terrific at
it, yes. But it's time to show more range. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes.
C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Muse'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Albert Brooks, Sharon Stone
</P>
<P>
   and Andie MacDowell.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Brooks wrote, directed and stars in this Hollywood fable
about a screenwriter who's ``lost his edge'' and is sent to an
honest-to-the-gods Muse (Sharon Stone) for inspiration. Stone is
delicious. She plays her Muse as a mix of material girl, expert
networker and distracted spoiled child. In other words, she's
modeled her after half of Hollywood. (ERG) 1 hour, 37 minutes. A-

<P>
   ``Mystery Men'' PG-13 (comic action violence
</P>
<P>
   and crude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Stiller, Geoffrey Rush,
</P>
<P>
   Hank Azaria and Janeane Garofalo.
</P>
<P>
   It's a spoof! It's an adventure! No, it's an amiable mess. Ben
Stiller and Janeane Garofalo headline a ragamuffin team of
superhero wannabes. But the movie is mostly like its hapless heroes
_ kind of clumsy and good intentioned but with none of the knack it
takes to save the day, or itself. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   2 hours, 1 minute. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside Providence'' R (teen drug use, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   sexual references)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Shawn Hatosy
</P>
<P>
   and Alec Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   Just ignore the Miramax marketing campaign. This movie may be
written by the ``There's Something About Mary'' gang, but it's
bittersweet funny, not raucous comedy. It's a coming-of-age tale of
a '70s Rhode Island teen (Shawn Hatosy) that captures the shaggy,
druggy ``what-next'' feeling that followed in the uncertain years
after the Summer of Love had come and gone. (SM) 1 hour, 42
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Runaway Bride'' PG (profanity and sexual innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julia Roberts
</P>
<P>
   and Richard Gere.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning, alas, doesn't strike twice in this reunion of
``Pretty Woman'' stars Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. However, the
film isn't a fiasco and it does well by its intended audience,
i.e., anyone who wants to see Roberts galloping on horseback in
full wedding regalia. She's a bride who's already choked at the
altar three times and is about to try again. He's a cynical
journalist who's betting she'll run. (ERG)1 hour, 56 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' PG-13 (intense thematic material
</P>
<P>
   and violent images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising, spine-tingling gem. Eight-year-old Cole (Haley
Joel Osment) can see ghosts, not the Casper variety but restless
phantoms with their skulls blown open. It's a fascinating, odd film
that speculates on what the relationship between the restless dead
and a liaison to the living world might be. Plus, this film has the
best, and loveliest, last-act twist of the year. (SM)1 hour, 47
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Stigmata'' R (profanity, sexuality, intense violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Patricia Arquette
</P>
<P>
   and Gabriel Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   Let it bleed without you. This mishmash of ``The Exorcist,''
``The Omen,'' etc. stars Gabriel Byrne as a Vatican investigator
sent to examine a young woman (Patricia Arquette) who's showing
signs of the stigmata, the wounds suffered by Christ on the cross.
Unfortunately, the movie prefers sensationalism to making sense.
It's enough to make you long for the good ol' days of pea soup and
spinning heads. (ERG)1 hour, 42 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Stir of Echoes'' R (profanity, sexual content
</P>
<P>
   and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Bacon
</P>
<P>
   and Kathryn Erbe.
</P>
<P>
   A ghost story with too many echoes of other flicks. It might
have seemed intriguing had it landed in theaters before ``The Blair
Witch Project'' and ``The Sixth Sense'' gave us new twists on the
spooky movie genre. A little boy sees ghosts and his hypnotized dad
(Kevin Bacon) goes wiggy while hunting what happened to a teen girl
haunting their home. (SM) 1 hour, 50 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle'' PG-13 (violence, sexuality, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   teen drinking)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Helen Mirren, Katie Holmes, Barry Watson and Marisa
Coughlan.
</P>
<P>
   It barely makes a passing grade. Three high school kids take
their evil history teacher hostage in her home and then try to
figure out how to get out of the mess they've created. It ends up
being a wishy-washy remake of 1980's silly ``Nine to Five.'' As the
tied-up teach, Helen Mirren is pretty good. Her young co-stars,
however, fail to match her talent. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 35
minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``The 13th Warrior'' R (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Antonio Banderas.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, cheesy movies can be great fun. That's true of this
rip-roaring yarn about a medieval Arab poet (Antonio Banderas)
who's drafted by a roving gang of rowdy Vikings to help rescue a
Norse village from a mysterious enemy that comes from the mist,
kills everything in sight and leaves a trail of headless corpses.
This flick hits the ground running and never stops. (ERG) 1 hour,
43 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Windmills of Your Mind'' is still on the soundtrack, but
lots of other gimmicks from the 1968 original have been excised.
That's good. This remake is a guilt-free summer diversion. Pierce
Brosnan is an appealing billionaire gentleman rogue, stealing
priceless paintings. But it's really Rene Russo's film. As the solo
investigator hot on his trail, she prowls the screen savoring a
smart, sexed-up character. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``trick'' R (sexuality, profanity
</P>
<P>
   and mature themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Christian Campbell
</P>
<P>
   and John Paul Pitoc.
</P>
<P>
   In this sturdy and well-acted gay romantic comedy, two guys
spend a night looking to make love in all the wrong places. Gabriel
(Christian Campbell) and Mark (John Paul Pitoc) pick each other up,
both clearly intending a mutually gratifying one-night stand. But
as the evening wears on, they're still on the street. The obstacles
become more contrived as the movie goes on. But, overall, ``trick''
is a minor treat. (ERG) 1 hour, 30 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Twin Falls Idaho'' R (kinkiness and adult themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mark
</P>
<P>
   and Michael Polish.
</P>
<P>
   Eerie. Intriguing. Identical twins, Mark and Michael Polish,
play conjoined (the popular term is Siamese) twins. Moving at its
own slow, surreal pace, the picture shows what happens when a young
hooker (Michele Hicks) falls for one of the twins, thus creating a
strange pas de trois. Exploring themes of love and loneliness, the
movie suggests that sometimes, wholeness can only be found by
letting go. (ERG) 1 hour, 45 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolves'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Not as visually stunning as some Imax films, this is a highly
instructive look at the once nearly vanquished gray wolf's gradual
reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park and other parts of the
American West. Covers a bit too much ground, historically and
geographically; the best parts show wolves ranging from adult pack
leaders to newborn cubs exploring and adjusting to the wild again.
(Jill Vejnoska) 41 minutes. B-

 &HT;    Genial `Blue Streak' a capable heist caperBy Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A good cop solves a crime by thinking like the perpetrator.
Given that logic, it makes sense that a real-life criminal would
make a terrific policeman. He can look at a crime scene and see
exactly what went down, while the officers around him are still
scratching their heads. That's the playful idea behind ``Blue
Streak,'' a decent, disposable Martin Lawrence vehicle. It never
gets maximum mileage from its crook-as-flatfoot premise, but it
stirs up decent laughs and action.
</P>
<P>
   Martin plays Miles Logan, a thief newly sprung from two years in
lockup. When he goes to the then-construction site where he stashed
a $17 million diamond, he discovers the finished building is the
new Los Angeles Police Department. Which means that he has to
infiltrate the station masquerading as a cop in order to track down
the missing rock, located somewhere in the AC vents.
</P>
<P>
   Miles not only succeeds in his charade, he keeps accidentally
doing the right thing, catching crooks and becoming a hero to his
erstwhile enemies, the cops surrounding him. (It's a comic reversal
of the current ``In Too Deep,'' starring Omar Epps as an undercover
cop dangerously drawn to the drug figures he's trying to bust.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue Streak'' doesn't ask big questions about identity. It's
basically a series of quick skits, letting Lawrence bluster and
give free rein to his spastic dances of victory or frustration.
Director Les Mayfield throws in enough action scenes to mollify
audiences who can't get enough gunfire and breaking glass. While it
doesn't exactly streak along, at 93 minutes ``Blue Streak'' gets
the job done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue Streak''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Martin Lawrence. Rated PG-13 for action violence,
continual profanity and some crude humor.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 33 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A decent, disposable Lawrence vehicle.

 &HT;    Southern politics no longer as lively in prosperous era
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 19.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The time to catch him was on a summer's night, down some dirt
road the lawyers and the bankers and the important people had no
need to travel. He called such an occasion ``a speakin','' but it
was more like a religious revival. He'd get to flailing those arms
like a man swatting mosquitoes, his brow beading with sweat, a
shank of frizzy rust-brown hair falling almost to his bulging
pop-eyes, and he'd hear the shouts of people whose voices no one
else heard. ``Pour it on 'em, Huey! Pour it on 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   And when he got going good the seersucker suit would hang on him
damp and limp, and two sizes too big. About this time the head
would be pivoting furiously, the vitriol spewing forth in all
directions but mostly in the direction of Standard Oil.
</P>
<P>
   As archetype, the Southern politician is both caricature and
social symbol, the embodiment of the region's politics and the
unflattering reflection of its people. Huey Long, dead of an
assassin's bullet before he was 43, was by all odds the most
ambitious and the most demagogic of a lot that has included his
brother Earl, Tom Watson, Pitchfork Ben Tillman, Theodore K. Bilbo,
Big Jim Folsom, Gene Talmadge and Jesse Helms. All have been, in
one way or another, embarrassments outside the flock of the
faithful and some were scoundrels to boot. But none have been
bland, none have been dull. ``From afar,'' V.O. Key wrote half a
century ago, ``outlanders regard Southern politics as a comic opera
staged on a grand scale for the amusement of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican inroads
</P>
<P>
   Key's magisterial work ``Southern Politics'' is the starting
point for anyone presuming to write about Southern politics, a book
whose analytic incisiveness is exceeded only by Key's gift for the
right phrase and the elegant synthesis of ideas. But the South of
which he wrote is not the South of today, even if some of its
problems _ race in particular _ endure in ameliorated form. Even
before Key's time, various ``New Souths'' were being prematurely
heralded, the first by Henry Grady, the editor a century ago of The
Atlanta Constitution. None was really new. All were backwaters of
poverty, pellagra and the poll tax, economic dependencies that
moved Franklin D. Roosevelt to declare the South ``the nation's No.
1 problem.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is saying that as the century closes. The South, if it is
not new, is manifestly different, nowhere more so than in its
politics. A few Cenozoic mastodons cling to office, but the
flamboyant demagogues of years past are being replaced by moderates
and conciliators. A more far-reaching change has also taken place:
The South now elects Republicans as well as Democrats, and in
numbers that have brought virtual parity between the parties.
</P>
<P>
   As Alexander Lamis, editor of ``Southern Politics in the 1990s''
(Louisiana State University Press, $39.95), acknowledges, the Solid
South of one-party rule had begun to corrode in the postwar years.
It corroded further in the '60s and '70s, and by 1990 it was gone
for good.
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of Lamis, a political scientist at Case
Western Reserve University, teams of journalists and political
scientists examined election results in the 11 states that Key had
studied, and the Republican rise is documented in cold, hard
numbers. No less than other Southern states, Georgia ``has emerged
into mainstream competition between two evenly matched political
parties that can take no office for granted.'' (The Georgia chapter
is co-written by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Tom Baxter,
along with political scientists Michael Binford of Georgia State
University and David Sturrock of Southwest (Minnesota) State
University.)
</P>
<P>
   In bed with religious right
</P>
<P>
   With the Sun Belt South's prosperity has come suburbanization,
an erosion of the old black-white coalition that had sustained the
Democratic Party and a growing willingness of white Southerners to
identify themselves as Republican. But the GOP's ascent has been
neither smooth nor uniform. It must still scrounge for good horses
to run a race, especially on the local level. And once it made
itself a bedfellow of the religious right, it found itself a party
divided _ economic conservatives and social moderates on one side,
single-issue religious conservatives on the other. Lamis quotes
U.S. Rep. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) on the frustration of having to
placate the religious right: ``They're not always wrong, but if you
don't always agree with them, you're always wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Such pith, alas, is an exception in ``Southern Politics in the
1990s.'' One of the pleasures of Key's book was a prose that put
matters just so, even in chapter subheadings. In Georgia, for
example, one found ``Rule of the Rustics.'' In Mississippi, ``Rout
of the Aristocracy: The Percys and the Bilbos.'' In Louisiana,
``Why a Huey Long?''
</P>
<P>
   Why things happen is always more interesting than what did
happen, and Key was both politically and sociologically acute. If
the 400-some pages of ``Southern Politics in the 1990s'' offer more
confirmation than elucidation, perhaps the grayness of presentation
is itself among the changes the South has witnessed for both better
and worse.

 &HT;    A casual, cultural excursion
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 19.
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ON THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER _ Ask anybody who's been on a few
cruises and they'll tell you that each has its own set of quirks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a different personality for every type of cruise,''
says Carol Heinrich, a Roswell travel agent who estimates she's
traveled the world's oceans and rivers more than 20 times in the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``On ocean vessels, you might have a wide variety of on-board
entertainment, but the scenery may be limited,'' Heinrich
continues. ``On a river cruise, your entertainment is primarily
going to come from other passengers, but you'll get to see more of
a particular region.''
</P>
<P>
   Put RiverBarge Excursions in the latter category. Launched just
a year ago by New Orleans entrepreneur Eddie Conrad, the cruise
line aims to be a casual, culturally focused alternative to the
Dixieland flashiness of the Delta Queen and other riverboats and to
the party-hardiness of many Caribbean cruises. Its River Explorer
hotel barge travels the Mississippi, Missouri and Ohio rivers, as
well as the Intracoastal Waterway along south Louisiana and Texas
on seven theme trips, including ``The Delta South,'' which visits
Louisiana's historic River Road plantation region, and ``Cajuns and
Creoles,'' which tours the Atchafalaya Basin.
</P>
<P>
   I recently signed on for the four-day ``Delta South'' excursion
and found a lot to love _ cheerful service, bountiful buffets,
spacious staterooms _ along with a few problems.
</P>
<P>
   The following is a report card of sorts for the trip. The grades
given for each category reflect my experiences as well as some of
my fellow passengers' on one particular excursion. Scores may rise
or drop depending on the itinerary and/or an individual's
temperament.
</P>
<P>
   ROOMS WITH A VIEW
</P>
<P>
   Accommodations: A-
</P>
<P>
   Many other cruise lines take a caste-system approach to putting
up guests, with accommodations ranging from closet-size cabins with
bunk beds to sprawling suites. RiverBarge is nicely egalitarian.
</P>
<P>
   The River Explorer's 99 staterooms, which forgo fussiness for
utilitarian comfort, are all the same size _ 200 square feet. They
are all air-conditioned and come with either one queen-size bed or
two twin beds. Each has a full-size bathroom with a shower and tub,
a rare luxury for a cruise vessel. (Most ship cabins have only
showers.) And no telescopic porthole views here. The rooms on the
lower Royal Deck feature large picture windows, while the upper
Platinum Deck rooms have sliding-glass doors leading to small
balconies, perfect for river-gazing. Binoculars are provided so you
can better read the T-shirt of that guy standing on a passing
freighter.
</P>
<P>
   When you get tired of the Mississippi's sights, you can plop
down on the bed and watch satellite TV or pop a video in the VCR _
movies are available for free in the game room. Each stateroom also
comes equipped with a mini-refrigerator, a telephone and a coffee
maker.
</P>
<P>
   ALL YOU CAN EAT ... AND THEN SOME
</P>
<P>
   Food: B
</P>
<P>
   Those who have savored the duck rillettes with truffle on a
Holland America cruise or supped on salmon and scallop
``carpaccio'' aboard the Radisson Diamond may find RiverBarge's
cuisine a tad ... common. The River Explorer's galley serves up
no-frills fare _ breakfast and lunch are buffet-style, dinner is a
la carte with ``blue plate specials'' to match the theme of each
excursion. Our dinner menu featured competently rendered Cajun
favorites such as jambalaya, crawfish etouffee and shrimp creole.
</P>
<P>
   The food may not be fancy, but, oh my, is there a lot of it. The
almost obscenely well-stocked buffets would bring out the glutton
in Calista Flockhart. For breakfast my first morning on the river,
I piled my plate with sausage, bacon, corned beef hash, scrambled
eggs, poached eggs, a waffle, canteloupe, pineapple, peaches and a
blueberry mini-muffin. Modest portions of each, to be sure, but
still _ oink! Lunch the next day was equally light, an unabashed
calorie-fest of pork tenderloins, shrimp po-boys and red beans and
rice with sausage.
</P>
<P>
   The galley's casual-dress, open-seating policy is also a plus.
Meals are served within a two- to 2 1/2-hour period, during which
guests can come and go at their leisure. If you miss a scheduled
meal, don't worry. The galley keeps a refrigerator stocked with
leftovers, which you are encouraged to raid whenever you feel
hungry.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE'S THE PARTY?
</P>
<P>
   On-board entertainment: C
</P>
<P>
   ``We are an externally focused cruise line,'' boasts RiverBarge
President Jeff Krida, meaning the company emphasizes culturally
significant shore tours over the on-board dances, Broadway reviews
and theme nights offered by other cruises.
</P>
<P>
   It shows. On longer excursions, RiverBarge may occasionally
invite guest performers aboard _ the ``Cajuns and Creoles'' tour
features brief appearances by a Cajun music group and a humorist.
But on our four-day trip, the only scheduled activities were two
hourlong lectures _ one on the Civil War and one on the history of
barges _ presented by crew members who frequently read from notes.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, guests were left to make their own fun. Some
played Scrabble or rummy in the galley, some took a dip in the hot
tub on the top deck, some sipped beer at the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Soper, a 37-year-old court reporter from Minneapolis,
summed up the feelings of many. ``This is a little mellow for me,''
she said. ``I wouldn't have minded seeing a show or two.''
</P>
<P>
   True to Heinrich's words, my fellow bargers provided much of the
on-board entertainment. Soper quizzed me at length on my
illustrious life as a travel writer; we were both dismayed to find
out she had been more places than I had. And I learned all about
Atlanta, Texas, from Jay and Shirley Clements, who have lived there
most of their lives. A timber town almost halfway between
Texarkana, Texas, and Shreveport, La., Atlanta was settled by
Georgia expatriates. Surrounding communities include Marietta,
Smyrna and Douglasville. Seems only fair that they should have a
share of our smog.
</P>
<P>
   FROM RIVER ROAD TO BOURBON STREET
</P>
<P>
   Shore tours: B+
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, shore excursions are RiverBarge's forte. On our trip,
we explored rural and urban history alike, making two stops at
antebellum estates in Louisiana's plantation country before barging
back for an enlightening bus tour of the Big Easy.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop was Oak Alley Plantation, about 60 miles north of
New Orleans. This Greek Revival stunner is the perfect postcard
image of an antebellum mansion: A canopy formed by two rows of
giant live oaks, planted almost 300 years ago by a French settler,
shades the quarter-mile path from the river to the main house.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1837-39 by a sugar planter named Jacques Telesphore
Roman III, the mansion is ringed by 28 Doric columns and features
such fancy-weird indoor adornments as ceiling medallions made of
horse hair and plaster and cypress fireplace mantels painted to
look like marble.
</P>
<P>
   Next we visited Nottaway Plantation, another Greek Revival manse
about 38 river miles north. Our arrival came later than expected.
We were scheduled for an early evening tour, but delays at the boat
landing and tricky logistics with the shuttle buses put us in
Nottaway's grand entrance hall at about 9 p.m. It was worth the
wait. The 65-room mansion, considered the largest in Louisiana,
twinkled in the warm night, and our hoop-skirted guides greeted us
with glasses of champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Back in New Orleans at journey's end, we embarked on a
three-hour bus tour that took us from the French Quarter to the
Garden District to Lake Ponchartrain. Our guide, a New Orleans
native, was an encyclopedia of local trivia. He filled us in on the
origins of Louis Armstrong's nickname, Satchmo (it's short for
``satchel mouth''; when the trumpeter performed on the streets of
New Orleans as a youngster, he kept his coins in his cheeks to foil
thieves), and the procedure for burying multiple bodies in the
city's above-ground tombs (don't ask).
</P>
<P>
   A quibble: Two plantations and a bus tour over four days was a
little skimpy. One more stop would make this itinerary a must for
history buffs.
</P>
<P>
   SHINY HAPPY PEOPLE
</P>
<P>
   Service: A
</P>
<P>
   If we heard it once on our trip, we heard it a hundred times:
``If you need anything at all, please don't hesitate to ask.'' It
was the crew members' mantra, and darned if they didn't seem to
mean it.
</P>
<P>
   Quite simply, the 42-person staff of the River Explorer does
``helpful'' right. Servers in the galley call you by name and scold
you good-naturedly when you get up to get your own soda refill.
Housekeepers leave sweets _ peppermints, chocolates, Rice Krispie
Treats _ in your room each day. Guest relations manager Skippy
Trahan entertains passengers waiting to disembark for shore tours
with saucy Cajun jokes featuring a pair of backwoods dimwits,
Boudreaux and Thibodaux.
</P>
<P>
   No crew member is off limits. In the pilot house, the captain
eagerly welcomes visitors _ you can stay all day and listen to him
patiently describe the functions of the various knobs, dials and
screens. If you're lucky enough to be sailing with relief captain
Joe Aucoin, ask him to tell you about riding out Hurricane Juan
while piloting a diesel barge on the Mississippi in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   And for once, there are no ulterior motives for the niceness.
The cruise line maintains a strict no-tipping policy _ that means
no envelopes left on your pillow on the last morning, no extended
hands at the bar and no expectant bellhops hesitating in the
doorway of your room.

   ON THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER: the doorway of your room.
</P>
<P>
   HEAVY METAL, MUDDY WATERS
</P>
<P>
   Scenery: B-
</P>
<P>
   Maxine Loffler of Snellville gushes about the gorgeous views on
her December cruise with RiverBarge. The 58-year-old retired banker
sailed the ``Route of Jean Lafitte'' along the Intra-
</P>
<P>
   coastal Waterway from New Orleans to Port Isabel, Texas, making
a scenic stop at the edge of Louisiana's Barataria swamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were deer all along the shore, the crew shined a
spotlight on them,'' Loffler remembers. ``Then we looked up in the
trees and saw that they were filled with great white birds (likely
egrets).''
</P>
<P>
   Nature lovers would be wise to opt for Lafitte's course or the
``Cajuns and Creoles'' swamp trek over the ``Delta South'' trip.
The stretch of the Mississippi we traveled offered few natural
wonders. Birdwatching bargers were hard-pressed to find a feathered
friend through their binoculars, and aside from the rare live oak,
the banks were dominated by stubby willows _ plain-Jane sisters to
the more dramatic weeping variety. And the 40-foot levee that
brackets the Mississippi made it impossible to view the vast sugar
cane fields or stately plantations inland.
</P>
<P>
   No, here nature took a back seat to man-made wonders. Freighters
the size of small countries passed within several dozen feet of our
barge every few minutes. Dizzyingly high suspension bridges cast
ribbonlike shadows over the top deck. And, oh, those petrochemical
refineries!
</P>
<P>
   Despite the abundance of industry, there was a notable lack of
pollution. No oil slicks stained the sides of the barge, no
cast-off chemical drums littered the banks. Here, man and nature
seem to have developed a mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
   FLOATS OUR BOAT
</P>
<P>
   Final grade: B
</P>
<P>
   So is a RiverBarge cruise worth the money? Excursions can cost
from $740 to $2,995 (based on double occupancy), depending on the
length of the trip and the time of year. All in all, I'd say it's a
fine value, provided you're prepared to deal with the occasional
snafu and a lot of relaxation time. As for the above complaints,
well, fellow passenger Jay Clements said it best when we were late
getting to Nottaway Plantation: ``I've always heard that if people
aren't griping just a little bit, they're not having a good time.''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    A barge cruise along the mighty Mississippi offers time and
space to watch the world roll by
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 19.
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ON THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER _ It may be the slowest game of chicken
in history.
</P>
<P>
   As the River Explorer barge inches upriver _ destination:
Nottaway Plantation, 18 miles south of Baton Rouge _ it meets a
massive oil tanker headed back to New Orleans. Up in the pilot
house, relief captain Joe Aucoin studies the approaching vessel,
which looks like it might close the half-mile gap between us in,
oh, about a day.
</P>
<P>
   Aucoin knows who's boss here. ``You got to give the big boats
some room, especially if they're coming downriver,'' says the New
Orleans native in a thick Cajun-country drawl. At length, he
reaches over and taps a short steel steering lever and the barge,
no scrawny
</P>
<P>
   dinghy at 860 tons, adjusts course.
</P>
<P>
   The two giants pass _ eventually _ without incident. There's no
desperate hand-over-hand wrenching of a giant wooden wheel, a la
``Shipwrecked.'' No frenzied radio calls, no drama. A tap is all it
takes to navigate these placid waters. The Mississippi may be
mighty, but it's a quiet strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it gets choppy, but only a little,'' says Aucoin,
who's been piloting barges, tankers and cargo ships up and down the
Big Muddy for 25 years. ``The only thing you have to worry about is
the traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, our ``Delta South'' voyage, a four-day exploration of
Louisiana's historic plantation region offered by RiverBarge
Excursions of New Orleans, covers a stretch of the Mississippi
teeming with industry. Convoys of cover-top barges haul corn and
grain. Chemical tankers get their fill at loading platforms along
the banks. Imposing Coast Guard icebreakers loom over sprawling
shipyards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, so many of these companies have changed names,
changed hands,'' Aucoin says. ``The river never changes.''
</P>
<P>
   And to experience it from the decks of the River Explorer is to
go with the unhurried flow. The 730-foot, 198-passenger barge
hotel, launched a year ago this week, crawls along at a tad over 15
mph. At times, the workers walking on those land-anchored loading
platforms seem to be traveling faster.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers loll on lattice-steel chaise lounges on the top deck,
basking in the hot sun and contemplating the endless rows of
willows lining the Mississippi. A tugboat chugs by. A fat cloud
drifts lazily in the sky. And the river rolls on. Mile after
tranquil mile.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a tense, Type A personality, or a jaded traveler used
to glitz and spectacle, this may sound like a slow boat to boredom.
But a lot of folks seem to love the pokey pace.
</P>
<P>
   RiverBarge's four- to 10-day excursions, which include
itineraries on the Mississippi, Missouri and Ohio rivers and along
the Intracoastal Waterway from New Orleans to southernmost Texas,
are sold out until Thanksgiving. More than half of next year's
trips are booked.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a less intense experience than other cruises,'' says
RiverBarge president Jeff Krida, who's along for the ride to
schmooze travel agents the cruise line is courting. That's
experience talking _ Krida was president of the rival Delta Queen
Steamboat Co. for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Delta Queen's immensely popular paddle wheelers,
RiverBarge doesn't offer a lot of snazzy trappings. The decor is
more Holiday Inn than high Victorian, mealtime is come-as-you-are
(with no assigned seating) and the entertainment tends toward guest
lecturers and indigenous music performances rather than ice cream
socials or sock hops.
</P>
<P>
   But Krida says his target audience, Americans 40 and older, is
drawn to the casual atmosphere, the comparatively huge staterooms,
the no-tipping policy and, above all, the price tag. A RiverBarge
sailing is cheaper than the average Delta Queen excursion and
includes meals and shore tours _ everything but alcohol and phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Count Jay and Shirley Clements of Atlanta, Texas, among the
satisfied customers. ``I'd love to come back and take the
Intracoastal Waterway trip,'' says Jay, 64, as he strolls the
grounds of Oak Alley Plantation, the first shore tour on our
excursion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see so much on a cruise like this,'' he continues,
surveying the breathtaking allee of live oaks that flank the
walkway to the main house. ``We took a cruise to the Bahamas once,
and being out on the ocean in such a big boat, we might as well
have been in our den at home.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis travel agent Betty Heimburger, making her first
RiverBarge trip, likes the cruise because ``it's relaxed, more
intimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly in a rush to go nowhere herself, she takes in the view
and enjoys a rare south Louisiana breeze by the barge's outdoor
snack bar. ``This would be perfect for an older couple, maybe on a
second honeymoon, who don't want to deal with the party crowds on
the other cruises,'' she adds. ``They would have plenty of time and
space to be alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Time? Space? Now those are unique concepts. The Mississippi
means to teach us all about them.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the River Explorer after the plantation tour, Jay
Clements appears ready for the lesson. ``It's a long way from one
end of this barge to the other, and Shirley and I know because
we've walked it,'' he marvels. ``And still, we're just a dot out
here on the river.''

 &HT;    Age cannot wither nor custom stale the infinite variety of
vintage clothes, retailers find
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 19.
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the world's top fashion designers unveiled their
spring/summer 2000 collections in New York last week, some
retailers weren't interested. To purveyors of vintage clothing and
accessories, the hottest styles aren't still to come; they've
already been worn. Decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, the beige silk Shantung pants with the slim
leg and tab belt at Stefan's Vintage Clothing in Little Five
Points. Shop owner Rebecca Birdwhistell thinks the pants are such a
rare find that she could get at least $1,000 for them. But she's
not selling.
</P>
<P>
   The slacks were worn by none other than the late Fred Astaire in
the 1953 movie ``The Band Wagon.'' Birdwhistell found them in a box
of old clothes she purchased for $100 at an open-air market in New
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the high point of the last six months, in terms of
being excited about finding something totally cool,'' she says. ``I
saw sewn into the label `Metro Goldwyn Mayer.' Underneath that was
handwritten `Fred Astaire.' To me it's a piece of American film
history, and I'll probably never find another pair.''
</P>
<P>
   Vintage clothiers such as Birdwhistell travel nationwide in
search of garments. Anything worn between the 1940s and the 1970s
qualifies as vintage, but the older, the better.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's a swing skirt, a Jacqueline Kennedy-esque fitted
suit or a mini-dress with go-go boots, the best finds, retailers
say, are at garage sales, flea markets and estate sales away from
the big cities.
</P>
<P>
   Angela McLean, owner of Psycho Sisters, which sells vintage and
resale clothing at four metro Atlanta locations, likes to shop in
Florida, Alabama and North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as trendy as Atlanta, so if older people retire and
donate their clothes to thrift stores or have a garage sale, I'm
still able to buy them for a price point and pass on the value to
my customers,'' McLean says.
</P>
<P>
   Birdwhistell, who spends at least 60 percent of her time on the
road, likes shopping in Texas and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Although vintage clothing is becoming a hot commodity _ a tartan
1948 Schiaparelli bustle skirt sold for more than $25,000 at a
recent Sotheby's auction _ retailers say they aren't in the
business for the money. They do it because they love collecting old
clothes and can earn a living at it.
</P>
<P>
   Frances Clayton, owner of Twice Is Nice in Hapeville, (Ga.) has
sold vintage clothing for more than a decade. Some of her old hats
and dresses have even appeared in movies, including ``Boxing
Helena'' and ``To Dance With the White Dog.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're wanting swing dresses now because young folks are back
into swing dancing,'' Clayton says. ``I also sell a lot of things
for '70s parties and '50s parties.''

`FOR LOVE OF THE GAME': REACHING FOR ONE LAST STRIKE IN LIFE'S LAST
INNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, movie fans. We're down to the final frames of ``For Love of
the Game,'' and the big questions are still unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Is Kevin Costner as 40-year-old Billy Chapel of the Detroit
Tigers, with 19 major league seasons and more than 4,000 pitches on
his frayed, pain-ravaged right arm, going to complete a perfect
game in front of more than 56,000 fans at Yankee Stadium on the
last day of the season?
</P>
<P>
   And will Chapel realize before it is too late and she flies off
to a new job in London that Kelly Preston as Jane Aubrey, talented
magazine writer and editor and plucky single mom, is the love of
his life?
</P>
<P>
   But before we answer these questions and find out if the
imperfect man wins his perfect game or exchanges his passion for
baseball for a passion for Jane, first a time out.
</P>
<P>
   Not to sell you a beer or a four-wheel drive vehicle but to tell
all those guys out there who decided on the basis of the trailers
and commercials that ``For Love of the Game'' was a baseball movie
that Universal Pictures has tossed you a noon-to-6 curve.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Love of the Game'' is a baseball movie the way ``You've
Got Mail'' was a movie about the retail book business.
</P>
<P>
   But while you're standing there, frozen, jaws gaping, ponder
this good news and bad news: ``For Love of the Game'' is two movies
for the price of one: a baseball story and a big, gooey romance.
You know, a date movie.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, deep down, or au fond as the romantic French say, ``For
Love of the Game,'' directed by Sam Raimi (``A Simple Plan'') is
really about the love of a difficult man for a good woman.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball story, thanks to Costner's athletic credibility
(see ``Bull Durham'' and ``Field of Dreams'') and a complement of
real ballplayers like Ricky Ledee, Dave Eiland and Juan Nieves,
umpires like Rich Garcia and Jerry Crawford and other
professionals, works better than the romance. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Taken together, they add up to routine entertainment, because
the overloaded love story doesn't strike sparks or really tug the
heartstrings, and the script by Dana Stevens pivots on behavior
that sometimes seems more convenient than character-driven and has
some ludicrous lines.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the story of Chapel's crucial game is the story of
his five-year romance with Jane Aubrey, seen in flashbacks as the
star pitcher tries to coax one more win out of a worn-out arm while
Vin Scully as the television announcer invests the proceedings with
the prose poetry of the national pastime. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  And as Chapel battles the batters, he is also harboring the
news that the team on which he has spent his adult life is being
sold by family ownership to a corporation that plans to trade him
as fast as it can. Is it time to quit?
</P>
<P>
   In the let-'em-meet cute onset of the romance, Chapel, driving a
Porsche convertible while on a Tigers' visit to New York, picks up
Jane at the side of a road, where she is venting her fury on her
broken-down VW. At first unaware of Chapel's fame, Ms. Preston,
playing the role of winsome woman that in recent years has seemed
to be the property of Meg Ryan, rapidly succumbs to his charms. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  And so begins a now-and-then relationship that gradually
deepens and then shatters in the face of Chapel's self-absorption
and refusal to acknowledge any emotional need except for his
profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can only end bloody for me, Billy,'' Jane tells him at
one point.
</P>
<P>
   So as the big game begins, Jane is at Kennedy Airport, ready to
begin a new life in a new country.
</P>
<P>
   John C. Reilly contributes neatly humorous support as Gus
Sinski, the stubbled catcher whose concern for the pitcher prompts
Chapel to call him the ugliest wife in baseball. And Jena Malone
brings honesty to her portrayal of the daughter born when Jane was
only 16.
</P>
<P>
   But filmmaking, like baseball, is a team game, and sometimes
even a talented lineup produces unexceptional results. &UR;  &QL;

   MET-EGYPT-EXHIBIT (New York) _ A major show of Old Kingdom art,
now at the Metropolitan, easily gets the early vote for blockbuster
of the fall season. Organized at the museum by Dorothea Arnold and
handsomely installed, it's one of those spectacles, like the
Byzantine, Chinese and Mexican surveys that the Met has done in
recent years, that is not just about art but about a whole
civilization. It examines the first great epoch in Egypt, the 500
years from 2650 B.C. to 2150 B.C., which is really the high point
of all ancient Egyptian culture, when the pyramids were built and
the canon of Egyptian art was established. As well as any show, it
demonstrates why Egyptian art still holds an incredible fascination
in the West. By Michael Kimmelman.

   APPLES-SANTA-FE (Santa Fe, N.M.) _ ``The City Different,'' they
like to call it, and that it is, a heady blend of Hispanic, Native
American and Anglo cultures, with a brisk topping up, these last
few decades, of new money, big money, from Texas, California and
New York. By R.W. Apple Jr.

   COWARD-CENTENNIAL (New York) _ Noel Coward, the playwright,
actor, composer, fiction writer and cabaret star who would have
turned 100 on Dec. 16, did indeed love being attractive. It was an
essential part of his art, and in his later years he could never
understand the young actors who made a point of looking unkempt.
Star quality, as the critic Kenneth Tynan wrote, was Coward's Holy
Grail, a trait of which he said happily, ``I don't know what it is,
but I know I've got it.'' And to allow stellar light to dim or
tarnish was to him a grave act of irresponsibility. The
celebrations surrounding the Coward centennial this fall, which
range from film and television festivals to New York productions of
two of his late works (``Waiting in the Wings,'' ``Noel Coward in
Two Keys''), bear witness to the staying power of this impeccably
maintained persona. They also speak of the stamina of a man who
entered show business as an 11-year-old child actor and never
really left it until his death in 1973, refusing to let his public
image sag even as his critical and popular reputations yo-yoed
exasperatingly. By Ben Brantley.

 &HT;    ANOTHER APARTMENT BOMB ROCKS RUSSIA
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    550&AMP;add
 &HT;    By Charles W. Holmes 
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW Fearful Russians, uneasy about sleeping in their own
beds, reeled Thursday after yet another bomb ripped apart an
apartment building _ this time an early morning blast in southern
Russia that killed at least 17 and wounded more than 150.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth devastating bombing of an apartment block in
two weeks, apparent terrorist attacks that have left nearly 300
dead.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, some politicians and observers wondered whether the
government of President Boris Yeltsin would be the next victim if
the state security agencies cannot end the wave of terror.
Speculation has grown with each bombing that Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin, or Yeltsin himself, could be forced to resign amid
the reign of panic that began on Sept. 4.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion Thursday in the southern city of Volgodonsk ripped
the face off a nine-story, 144-unit apartment building. Authorities
believe the explosives may have been hidden in a truck or in
underground pipes.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll was expected to rise as 20 of the 72 injured
admitted to area hospitals were reported to be in grave condition.
</P>
<P>
   As in the previous blasts, no group claimed responsibility for
the explosion in Volgodonsk, a city of 250,000 about 500 miles
south of Moscow and near Russia's turbulent southern republics.
</P>
<P>
   Russian authorities suspect the bombings are the work of
terrorists aligned with Muslim insurgents from the breakaway
republic of Chechnya. Federal troops have been engaged in fierce
battles against the guerrillas for the past five weeks, seeking to
drive them from the southern Russian republic of Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen leaders have denied any link to the explosions in
Russia, though the car bombing of a Russian military residence
compound in Dagestan on Sept. 4, killing 64, was widely believed to
be directly linked to the ongoing fighting in the republic.
</P>
<P>
   Panic has swept Russia in the wake of the explosions,
particularly in Moscow where two apartment buildings were
destroyed. A bomb blast at an eight-story apartment building in
Moscow on Monday killed at least 119 people.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first explosion in Moscow last Thursday _ at an
apartment block on the southeastern outskirts of the city, claiming
93 lives _ police have been inundated with calls from nervous
residents. Between Monday and Thursday morning, Moscow police had
received 900 calls from people reporting suspicious activity they
believed to be the setting of explosives.
</P>
<P>
   The latest bombing set off a round of high-level government
meetings as Yeltsin and his government struggle to respond to the
unprecedented campaign of terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the strength and resources to wipe out terrorism,''
Yeltsin said, according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a traditional Yeltsin ally, Yegor Stroyev, the
chairman of Russia's upper house of parliament, has urged Yeltsin
to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the series of bombings and an unfolding scandal linking the
Kremlin to allegations of money laundering and corruption, rumors
have swirled throughout Moscow that Yeltsin may leave office before
the scheduled end of his term next summer. By leaving early and
calling early presidential elections for December, Yeltsin would
attempt to improve the chances for Putin, his chosen successor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Stroyev is scheduled today to chair an extraordinary session of
the Federation Council to discuss the security crisis in Russia. He
told reporters on Thursday that some of his comments in the article
may have been misunderstood, but he stopped short of a direct
denial.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary rumors say Yeltsin could use the security crisis to
declare a state of emergency and indefinitely prolong his term in
office.
</P>
<P>
   And in a measure of the deep distrust Russians have for their
government, the country's newspapers have been full of stories
suggesting that Russian political intrigue could be behind the
bombings as a means of tipping the political balance ahead of the
elections.
</P>
<P>
   So prevalent were rumors of possible Kremlin links to the
explosions, that a spokesman for the FSB, the federal security
service, gave a radio interview Thursday to deny them.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Zdanovich, the FSB spokesman, said it was ``absurd''
that some politicians and media reports have suggested that the
country's security forces and the Kremlin ``were involved in these
acts of terror.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a likely presidential candidate, said
the federal government had been late in reacting to the security
threat. He blamed the Chechens for the attacks and called for
retaliation against ``a bandit community engaged in terrorism,
slave trade and robbery.''
</P>
<P>
   The government is considering isolating Chechnya by placing a
military corridor around it. However, it is far from certain
whether Russia's poorly financed army could accomplish such a
mission.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Russia is placing its security forces on its own
streets to guard against further bombings.
</P>
<P>
   About 80,000 regular police and Interior Ministry troops have
been mobilized in Moscow alone to search apartments and vehicles
and to patrol streets. Since Monday, all 30,000 residential
buildings in the city of 10 million had been inspected at least
once, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a spokesman for the FSB, authorities since Monday
have prevented explosions at six different apartment buildings in
Moscow where they have discovered caches of explosives and timing
devices. In one building alone, police confiscated 3.5 tons of
explosives.

HOME-ALONE PETS GET A LIFE AT DOGGY DAY-CARE CENTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Candee Brodsky was a guilt-ridden parent. She and her spouse
worked full time in suburban Chicago, leaving their children home
alone every day, locked in the kitchen and sleeping in laundry
baskets.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say, the Brodsky kids were lonely and unsociable _
until Mom signed them up for day care. Now, twice a week, Snickers
and Sassi Brodsky, two Jack Russell terriers, spend the day at
Playful Paws, one of a burgeoning number of dog day-care facilities
opening nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The dogs are happier, and Brodsky is thrilled. ``It's worth
every penny,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike kennels that keep dogs in cages, doggy day care allows
constant interaction among canine clients. The businesses cater to
dog owners who, like Brodsky, are gone during the day and want a
better life for their secluded pups. Clients report marked
improvement in their dogs' social skills and a marked decline in
pet-owner guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``After about a month of going there, he was a totally different
dog,'' says Sara Moeller, whose black Labrador retriever, Jake,
attends day care once a week in Dallas. Jake, she reports, went
from hyper and distrustful to mellow and gentlemanly in four
visits.
</P>
<P>
   At Playful Paws in Prospect Heights, Ill., humans drop their
charges off in the mornings and pick them up in the evenings. The
5,000-square-foot ``activity center'' includes a living room with
love seat, television, rugs, dog beds and toys. Pups chase balls in
the outdoor playpen and are treated to massages and agility
training.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the hottest trend in animal care across the country,''
says owner Tracy Arnold, a former CPA who quit her job a year ago
to open Playful Paws in August.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold and other dog day-care entrepreneurs chalk up demand for
their services to several things. An increase in dual-income
families means no one at home during the weekday, and a healthy
economy is leaving people with more discretionary income.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are waiting longer to have kids, and they
still want to have that place where they can pour out their
affection,'' adds Kimberly Garsed, owner of Urban Dog Playcare in
Los Angeles. ``These people think their dogs are their children.''
</P>
<P>
   A hot trend on the coasts for a couple of years, doggy day care
is becoming ubiquitous. This year, the American Boarding Kennel
Association will offer two seminars on starting a doggy day-care
business at its annual meeting in October. And dozens of facilities
in states such as Colorado, Ohio, Florida, Nevada, California and
Massachusetts advertise their services on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Dee's Doggie Den claims to be the first and only doggy day care
shop in the Dallas city limits. Dee Fort opened her
3,000-square-foot facility in November 1998 at the corner of
Mockingbird and Skillman and takes about eight to 12 day-care dogs
a day. She warns off-the-cuff entrepreneurs against diving into the
business unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the hardest work you have ever done in your life,'' she
says. The dogs ``move at a rate of four paws to our two feet. But
the other side of it is that it is so rewarding to see dogs playing
and having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Day-care clients say the interaction makes their dogs more
confident and trusting around unfamiliar people and other pups. It
reduces separation anxiety and the sometimes destructive behavior
of dogs left alone all day. Plus, active dogs burn calories _ and
energy.
</P>
<P>
   Before Jake started going to day care, Moeller would return from
work to a pet ready to ``go, go, go,'' she says. Now, ``I'm
exhausted from work, he's exhausted from playing all day, and we
come home and have a very nice evening.''
</P>
<P>
   Most doggy day-care businesses require pets to have up-to-date
immunizations (beware of those that don't, say owners), and most
ask pet and owner to submit to an interview. Aggressive dogs are
usually turned away.
</P>
<P>
   Costs range from $8 (for a small dog at Dee's in Dallas) to $30
a day at Urban Dog in Los Angeles. Arnold charges $26 for a day at
Playful Paws, outside Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Brodsky can afford two days a week for Snickers and Sassi but
would like to make it three. She's an enthusiastic proponent of day
care for dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dog lovers understand it,'' Brodsky says. ``And the people who
are not dog lovers look at me like I have three heads.''

   HURRICANE-RDP (Wilmington, N.C.) _ Hurricane Floyd comes ashore
near Cape Fear, N.C., with 110 mph winds, flooding the Carolina
coasts with more than a foot of rain as tens of thousands of people
huddled in shelters. At least seven deaths are blamed on the storm.
More than 480,000 people customers in the Carolinas and Virginia

`SPLENDOR': A MENAGE A TROIS FOR THE GOOD LOOKS AND THE LAUGHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gregg Araki's film ``Splendor'' is almost a textbook example of
what can go wrong when an artistic bad boy decides to be good. Or
rather half-good, since the romantic triangle ``Splendor'' explores
_ a pretty woman living happily with two pretty men and sharing her
bed with them _ is in its way transgressive.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Splendor'' Araki, best known for his shiny Pop Art
exercises in post-teen-age nihilism, has created a kind of '30s
screwball comedy for the millennium. The movie is certainly lovely
to look at, with its dreamy close-ups of attractive people
meticulously posed for a camera that worships their youth and
beauty with a naked adoration.
</P>
<P>
   But in examining the menage a trois of Veronica (Kathleen
Robertson) and her two lovers, Abel (Johnathon Schaech) and Zed
(Matt Keeslar), ``Splendor,'' which opens Friday in New York , is
largely devoid of genuine human feeling. Take jealousy. Yes,
there's a smidgen or two but nothing that can't be comfortably
taken in stride.
</P>
<P>
   Competitiveness? In dutifully uniting to serve their common
mistress, an aspiring film actress, Abel and Zed appear to have
quelled any anxieties about which one she might prefer or who might
be better in the sack.
</P>
<P>
   Passion? None is apparent. When the three are shown in bed
together, Abel and Zed resemble playful puppies gently nuzzling
Veronica from either side, while she effuses all the erotic heat of
a matron reading magazines while under a hair dryer.
</P>
<P>
   Veronica, who narrates the story in a blase singsong, meets her
two honeys at the same nightclub on the same evening. She instantly
recognizes Abel, a sometime rock critic who is dressed as Prince
Valiant for the occasion, as her witty, intellectual soul mate,
although we are never treated to any of his witty, intellectual or
soulful observations. Zed, the drummer for an aspiring rock band,
she tells us, is a magnetic sexual animal with perfect abdominals
who seduces Veronica on the floor backstage that very night.
</P>
<P>
   For the next few months, Veronica juggles the two suitors who
grudgingly tolerate each other's existence until the night they
accidentally meet at an outdoor rock event and nearly come to
blows. Veronica calls an emergency meeting at which she cajoles her
rivals into kissing each other.
</P>
<P>
   While Abel shyly pecks Zed on the cheek, Zed plants a light,
lingering, kiss on Abel's lips that Abel seems to enjoy. But once
the three begin sharing the same house and the same king-size bed,
the movie steers away from pursuing any homosexual hanky-panky.
</P>
<P>
   Even after trouble arrives in the form of Ernest (Eric Mabius),
a wealthy and charming young television director who falls in love
with Veronica at first meeting and whisks her off to Hawaii for a
quickie vacation, Abel and Zed wouldn't dream of turning to each
other for sexual solace. They'd rather sit around at night getting
drunk and moaning over the absence of their shared sweetie.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a formulaic path that brings a predicable major
complication and a last-minute race against time borrowed from
``The Graduate,'' ``Splendor'' reaches a simpering, feel-good
ending. Think of it as ``Jules and Jim'' reimagined as an Archie
comic book with the sexual roles reversed, and photographed by
Bruce Weber for a photo spread in Seventeen magazine.

`SPEAKING IN STRINGS': FIERY VIOLINIST LIVING AN OPERATIC LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not long after the phenomenal Italian-born violinist Nadja
Salerno-Sonnenberg moved to the United States at the age of 8, she
attended a class whose students were asked to play show and tell by
talking about their favorite thing in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But when this brilliant young musician presented a recording of
the Brahms violin concerto to the class, she was met with derisive
laughter. She was so upset, she recalls in Paola di Florio's
sympathetic documentary portrait, ``Speaking in Strings,'' that she
angrily cursed her classmates and ran from the room in tears.
</P>
<P>
   This humiliating childhood experience speaks volumes about the
problems of being a classical musician in a pop universe. But Ms.
Salerno-Sonnenberg's aggressive response to her peers' scorn was
also an indication of the bluntly feisty personality behind her
extravagantly romantic style.
</P>
<P>
   When performing a piece like the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto,
Ms. Salerno-Sonnenberg becomes carried away and lays herself bare.
And her fiery emotionality, much of which derives from her
childhood passion for opera, has not been greeted with unanimous
critical approval.
</P>
<P>
   While the film remembers Ms. Salerno-Sonnenberg's teen-age
celebrity _ she once joked with Johnny Carson and had her own
segment on ``60 Minutes'' _ it devotes the bulk of its energy to
her problems as an adult. The personal price of being a classical
superstar, the film suggests, is high, especially for a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't it Janis Joplin who once described the agony of ending up
alone in a motel room at the end of the night after having
ecstatically bonded with an audience? Ms. Salerno-Sonnenberg seems
to have suffered similar frustrations after pouring out her heart
and soul on the stage.
</P>
<P>
   In one scene she is shown being reassured by a psychic that yes,
she will one day have a child. Earlier in the film she begins to
talk about a recently broken relationship but stops herself when
she begins to weep.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the movie draws a curtain over her intimate personal
life. We meet no lovers, past or present, only admiring, loyally
protective friends, associates and family members.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salerno-Sonnenberg's serious troubles began five years ago
when she cut off the tip of her left little finger while slicing
onions. The accident would have ended the career of a less
determined performer. Until she regained the use of that finger,
she risked permanently injuring her hand by refingering her
repertory and continuing her concert schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Exhausted and depressed, she suffered what she calls an
``existential crisis'' and attempted suicide. But luck was on her
side. When she pulled the trigger, the gun she held to her head
clicked without firing. After that, she recalls, she had to learn
to embrace life ``a minute at a time.'' She has since discovered
that happiness is something that ``takes guts.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the personal turmoil it presents, the woman who emerges
from ``Speaking in Strings,'' which opens Friday in New York, is a
likable down-to-earth person who seems to know herself very well.
If it takes courage to be happy, the movie suggests, it may take
even more courage to live out a larger-than-life destiny whose
precipitous ups and downs are a measure of the talent being served.

`ROMANCE': HER LIBIDO AS THE NAVIGATOR, ONE WOMAN'S ADVENTURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In her solemn, sexually graphic ``Romance,'' Catherine Breillat
explores the nature of a woman's need for male attention and erotic
love. Though many of her film's insights might be obtained from
back copies of Cosmopolitan plus a smattering of the Marquis de
Sade, watching it is a memorable experience for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Not least of these is its blunt hard-core frankness. It's
doubtful that the film's intellectual aspects would command the
same attention if the camera did not make the actors' genitals as
familiar as their faces.
</P>
<P>
   The carnal and cerebral erotica in ``Romance'' have already
achieved the considerable feat of shocking France. No doubt the
film also intrigued French audiences with its mix of stony
posturing and bedroom candor, though its air of detachment
literally leaves a lot to be desired.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Breillat is capable of emphasizing the archetypal aspects of
her heroine's affair with, say, a character played by an Italian
porn star (Rocco Siffredi), even as she films the kind of encounter
that ordinarily keeps the archetypes at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Her film hovers between passion and philosophical argument
without fully achieving its ambition to fuse the two.
</P>
<P>
   Marie (Caroline Ducey), a schoolteacher, is engaged in a
dead-end relationship with a male model named Paul (Sagamore
Stevenin). Paul is so bored with Marie that he's bored when she
fellates him. Wearing white clothes against the white sheets of
their white bedroom, they discuss this situation in ways that send
Marie reeling into sexual adventures with new men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Romance'' is schematic enough to change its palette to red as
its heroine heats up.
</P>
<P>
   Since Ms. Ducey's performance can be raw enough to reveal
glimpses of Marie's desperation, ``Romance'' does invite strong
empathy with her situation. Rebounding from Paul into a bar, she
flashes the kind of newly reckless smile that anyone would
understand.
</P>
<P>
   On the dance floor, she picks up Paolo ( Siffredi) for a talky
fling. Being with Paolo leads her to conclude (``it's
metaphysical'') that there is a relationship between the size of
her lover's penis and her state of mind. A male director would take
a barrage of flak for coming to comparable conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Later, and more meaningfully for Marie, she becomes involved
with Robert (Francois Berleand), a school principal with an
encyclopedic interest in sexual bondage. Through watching these
two, the viewer can discover, among other things, that it is slow,
demanding work to tie up someone in esthetically satisfying ways.
</P>
<P>
   As they establish the limits of their sadomasochistic bond,
Robert does most of the talking (``It's strange, obscenity doesn't
bother women'') while Marie experiences unexpectedly profound
emotions. Subsequent encounters with a brutish stranger and a group
of gynecologists heighten the film's efforts to strip its boyishly
built heroine of all her illusions and most of her clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The seriousness of Ms. Breillat (``36 Fillette'') is never in
question, at least as far as the taint of exploitation is
concerned. The clinical nudity around which her film revolves is
indeed essential to its central idea, that of a woman who frees
herself from masculine power and cruelty by venturing into the
unknown and going as far as her libido will take her.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that much of this journey covers fundamentally
familiar ground, except at those rare moments when the film comes
up with startling visual metaphors for the mind-body dilemma. When
Marie imagines herself divided at the waist, with a kind male
companion for her upper body and her lower engaged in anonymous raw
sex with strangers, ``Romance'' is as eloquent as it wants to be.
</P>

`TAXMAN': BEYOND THE CALL OF DUTY, AN ODD COUPLE OF CIVIL
SERVANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An unlikely pair of sleuths, aided and abetted by the
atmospheric Russian community of Brighton Beach, Brooklyn,
transform the familiar materials of ``Taxman'' into a offbeat
little charmer of a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli-born Avi Nesher wrote the film's screenplay with
Roger Berger, whose background is in tax investigation. As directed
by Nesher, ``Taxman'' makes heroes of its outcast investigators,
speaks up for all low-level workers who retain a sense of justice
and honor in a greedy, immoral and indifferent world, and looks
where it can in the midst of gunplay and threats to find pockets of
decency, kindness, good humor and familial warmth.
</P>
<P>
   The sleuths are Al Benjamin (Joe Pantoliano), an impulsive,
obsessive New York State tax investigator, and Joseph Romero (Wade
Dominguez), a bright young Russian-speaking police officer. What
brings them together is a Russian Mafia mass murder that leaves six
people dead in the Brighton Beach office of a small gasoline
company.
</P>
<P>
   Although Benjamin and Romero are dedicated to their jobs, they
are huge annoyances to their superiors. Benjamin's boss considers
his doggedness a pain in the nether regions, and Romero's only
value to his superiors seems to be his language skill and his
ability to fetch coffee. Although intelligent and eager, he is by
his own admission a bad shot and can't drive well.
</P>
<P>
   But Benjamin, who has spent months before the murders pursuing
the idea that someone in the Brighton Beach Russian community has
been defrauding the authorities of millions of dollars in gasoline
taxes, reluctantly agrees to accept Romero's help after they meet
at the death scene.
</P>
<P>
   In their relentless, often discouraging pursuit, they find their
way up the ladder of corporate concealment and past armies of
Russian Mafia thugs and hit men to the so-called cabbage: the
Russian Big who is in league with a major American oil company.
</P>
<P>
   On the way Benjamin and Romero meet everyone from Andre Rubakov
(Michal Chiklis), a kindly Russian-born gas-station owner, and his
beautiful daughter, Nadia (Elizabeth Berkley), to an assistant
United States attorney, Peyton Cody (Robert Townsend), who very
reluctantly agrees to take on the case.
</P>
<P>
   When not staking out the streets of Brighton Beach by day and
gas stations by night, despairing over the progress of their
investigation, grieving over the carnage inflicted by suicidal
Chechnyan hit men or chasing them through the desolate off-season
landscape of Coney Island, Benjamin and Romero dance at a
Russian-Jewish wedding, share delicacies from Zabar's and reveal
themselves to each other and to the audience as endearing if
slightly wacky company.
</P>
<P>
   For civil servants like these, it's a delight to pay taxes.

`LUCIE AUBRAC': IN WAR A BOND BECOMES AN EROTIC EPIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who can forget that moment in ``Casablanca'' when Ingrid
Bergman, carried away by passion, her eyes shining, surrenders her
judgment to Humphrey Bogart and tells him that from now on he has
to do the thinking for both of them?
</P>
<P>
   Echoes of that moment resonate through Claude Berri's stirringly
romantic film ``Lucie Aubrac,'' except that the roles are reversed.
This time it is the woman (the film's title character, played with
a riveting authority by Carole Bouquet) who does the crucial
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   In a stunningly audacious scheme, she comes up with a plan to
rescue her husband, Raymond (Daniel Auteuil), a leader of the
French Resistance, who has been found guilty of war crimes by the
Nazis and faces execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucie Aubrac,'' like ``Casablanca,'' is set during the height
of World War II. The story it tells, based on the title character's
novel ``Ils Partiront Dans l'Ivresse'' is essentially true. What
raises the movie above the level of a well-made World War II
thriller is its convincing, uncorny portrait of a marriage whose
heightened passions reflect the sort of nobility that is a staple
of World War II films from ``Casablanca'' through ``Saving Private
Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   The early scenes of Lucie and Raymond together show a union in
which the couple's mutual respect, courage and moral fiber feeds
their intense erotic bond. When they make love, you have the sense
that Lucie and Raymond are more than lovers. Each one is a hero in
the other's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   For them lovemaking is a sacred rite of mutual worship. And true
to the spirit of World War II films, they emerge as unblemished
paragons of virtue.
</P>
<P>
   The twist is that this relationship is not your standard
``strong man sweeps melting beauty into his arms'' movie coupling.
Lucie, the aggressor, stalks through the film like a lithe, elegant
tiger, effusing a kind of moral hauteur along with a lethal
intensity of purpose. We sense the same qualities when she is
making love to her somewhat older husband, and he regards her with
the awed tenderness of a child.
</P>
<P>
   He is the one whose eyes shine, who blissfully surrenders. Ms.
Bouquet's and Auteuil's embodiment of this relationship feels so
natural that when Lucie conceives her extremely perilous plan to
save his life, you have no doubt that if anyone can pull off the
impossible, she can.
</P>
<P>
   Around this vision of an extraordinary marriage, Berri has
constructed a gripping period thriller that clicks along without
resorting to hyped-up shock effects or gimmicky suspense. It begins
with a smoothly executed scene of Raymond and his fellow Resistance
members scurrying on the railroad tracks near Lyons to plant a
device that will blow up a German supply train.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently we meet Raymond and the other underground freedom
fighters and learn something of the movement's elaborate
self-protective rituals and protocol. Eventually, however, Raymond
and his friends are betrayed, arrested and interrogated in scenes
that show Nazi brutality without rubbing our faces in torture.
</P>
<P>
   When all appears to be lost, Lucie concocts a daring rescue plan
that requires her to adopt a false identity and pose as a desperate
young woman pregnant with Raymond's child. Through a chain of
connections that involves bribery, she meets with a Nazi official
and begs that the condemned Raymond be allowed to marry her before
his execution so that her child can have a name.
</P>
<P>
   That is just the beginning of a scheme to ambush a military
truck carrying Raymond and take him to safety. Although it is the
sort of operation that has been detailed in innumerable caper
films, it is directed here with a taut efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   One reason ``Lucie Aubrac'' succeeds is that it doesn't oversell
its characters' bravery. These are people who feel that they have
no choice but to do what they must, and you root for them every
step of the way.
</P>
<P>

`BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS': THE AFFLUENT SOCIETY? WELCOME TO THE FUN
HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What could be a more fitting theme for Alan Rudolph's
phantasmagoric screen adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut Jr.'s novel
``Breakfast of Champions'' than that flowery 1950s ballad,
``Stranger in Paradise''? The song, which runs through the movie
like an ironic leitmotiv, distills an Eisenhower-era mood of
sanctimonious freeze-dried optimism tinged with paranoia that the
movie conjures with a demonic fervor.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the days, the movie reminds us, when it was almost a
heresy to disparage the booming affluence of a society that
television, then in its infancy, promoted as an unfolding paradise
on earth.
</P>
<P>
   In subsequent decades, of course, the pendulum swung so far in
the other direction that when Vonnegut's satire was published in
1973, it was almost a heresy (italics)not(end italics) to disparage
a corrupt, ``plastic'' culture poisoned with a thousand toxins,
from Watergate to Muzak.
</P>
<P>
   Today the wild exuberance with which that novel ridiculed the
grossness and absurdity of American greed and Babbitry seems
somehow naive. It is with a bitter self-awareness that we accept
the price of our present comfort as a willed, guilty blindness to
the problems of the rest of the world and to serious inequities
within our own society.
</P>
<P>
   In such a cynical climate, the vigor of Vonnegut's satire can
seem overheated and obvious. That's why Rudolph's film, made in a
spirit of gleeful early-'70s irreverence, also seems naive.
</P>
<P>
   Visually evoking a composite modernity that embraces half a
century of tackiness, the movie looks and feels like a frantic,
live-action psychedelic cartoon. Although its many targets,
including small-town conformity and greed, sexual prudery and
mass-cultural boorishness seem easy and familiar, the movie flails
at them with a wild, free-for-all energy. In its tone, the movie
might be described as a John Waters film divested of camp.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if you accept ``Breakfast of Champions'' as a work
unambiguously committed to spray-painting the screen with the
author's satiric vision of modern America as an absurdist madhouse,
it still churns up quite a head of froth.
</P>
<P>
   Watching it is a little like taking a ride through a giant fun
house. As you lurch furiously around the corners, you are
continually assaulted by visual and literary jokes that pop out you
like faces wearing maniacal grins, then disappear into the
blackness a moment later.
</P>
<P>
   A man delivers a sales pitch through a face on a thousand-dollar
bill. As one character walks through a parking lot, the ground
seems to give way like rubber under his feet. Another character
eases himself through a mirror to become a reflection of himself
staring back from an alternate universe.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing wrong with such clever tricks is that their
accumulation tends to smother the narrative and diminish the larger
metaphors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breakfast of Champions'' is set in mythical Midland City, a
suburb of nightmarish sterility through which runs an unnaturally
blue river choked with chemical wastes. It is a place whose
gleaming factories belch smoke and where the soil in a recently
constructed housing project has been deemed contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   Midland City's leading citizen and local hero is Dwayne Hoover
(Bruce Willis) a buttoned-down, toupeed car salesman who in a
series of garish television commercials, embodies American success
as a grotesque exercise in robotic self-promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the film, Dwayne who has alienated his
neurotic wife, Celia (Barbara Hershey) and his son, Bunny (Lukas
Haas), an aspiring lounge singer with a taste for glittery costumes
who slowly goes insane (or sane, depending on how you look at it).
Leading him toward his doom (or his salvation) is Kilgore Trout
(Albert Finney), an obscure, crusty old science-fiction writer who
travels to Midland City to be the guest of honor at the town's
first arts festival.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the movie takes place at Dwayne's surreal car
dealership, which is crammed with hideous tchotchkes and whose
piped-in soundtrack of Martin Denny exotica is attuned to its
win-a-free-trip-to-Hawaii contests. In this chirping, soulless
garden of kitsch, Dwayne's toadying employees do things like put on
Dwayne Hoover masks to collectively greet their boss.
</P>
<P>
   We meet his troubled right-hand man, Harry Le Sabre (Nick
Nolte), a closet transvestite who is on the verge of exploding from
withholding his secret. Other satirical characters include Dwayne's
smile-button of a secretary (and sometime girlfriend), Francine
(Glenne Headly), and Wayne Hoobler (Omar Epps), a desperately eager
car salesman who regards Dwayne as a capitalist god.
</P>
<P>
   The sterling cast, led by Willis, who deftly breaks his typical
mode to play Dwayne, pumps a lot of adrenaline (sometimes too much,
as in Nolte's case) into their caricatures, with Finney especially
fine. In the end, you have to admire Rudolph for making a film this
defiantly uncommercial.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, ``Breakfast of Champions'' is an incoherent mess.
But it never compromises its zany vision of the country as a
demented junkyard wonderland in which we are all strangers groping
for a hand to guide us through the looking glass into an unsullied
tropical paradise of eternal bliss.
</P>

`JUDGING AMY': ANOTHER MOM, ANOTHER DAUGHTER, ANOTHER CAPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(lh) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hartford, Conn., is within shouting distance of Providence,
R.I., in more ways than it seems. The Connecticut city is the
setting for CBS's new ``Judging Amy,'' which, like last year's NBC
hit ``Providence,'' sends a successful professional woman into
serious emotional regression as she moves back to her leafy New
England hometown to live with her family and start her life over.
The welcome difference is that the premiere of ``Judging Amy'' is
like ``Providence'' without the treacle.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Brenneman plays Amy Gray, a newly divorced mother and lawyer
who moves in with her widowed mom and becomes a family court judge.
So far she sounds suspiciously like Melina Kanakaredes' Syd, a
plastic surgeon who moves in with her widowed dad and works in a
Providence clinic. But where Syd is Mother Teresa in disguise (not
a concept that allows for many surprises from week to week), Ms.
Brenneman gives Amy an engaging and intelligent mix of strong will,
confusion and nerves. Even more winning, in ``Judging Amy'' the
family dynamics are realistically fraught.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't win the judgeship in a raffle,'' Amy tells her
argumentative, interfering mother, Maxine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, not far from it,'' says Mom, superbly played by Tyne
Daly with mother-knows-best impatience. Because she had been a
social worker for decades, Maxine thinks she knows and has seen it
all. She is also well-connected enough to get a police car to
follow her daughter when she is late and speeding to court.
</P>
<P>
   Amy also has an appealing relationship with one of her brothers,
Vincent (Dan Futterman, in a likably natural performance), a
would-be writer working as a dog-groomer. Together they can have
honest, if unproductive, talks about how to handle Mom.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brenneman, who is also an executive producer of the show,
found the idea in the life of her own mother, a juvenile court
judge. ``Judging Amy'' may be the television equivalent of a chick
flick, but the opening episode is never as cloying as its special
time slot suggests: Sunday at 8, usually the home of ``Touched by
an Angel.''
</P>
<P>
   When Amy gives her young daughter, Lauren, a speech about how
the best job she'll ever have is being a mom, she ends by asking:
``How was that? Not too sappy?''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's OK,'' the little girl says. ``You're nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   That scene shrewdly undercuts the sentimentality. But it also
drops a huge hint that Lauren is too observant to be a convincing
child. And, in fact, the series' second episode (which moves to its
regular time slot, Tuesday nights at 10) is disappointing. With Amy
harried by a long day in court yet determined to make a difference
to the families she is assigned to help, the episode has a
familiar, perfunctory tone. In that episode, ``Judging Amy'' seems
be turning into ``Providence'' before our eyes, which would be the
most serious regression of all.
</P>
<P>
   If you watch enough crime movies, can you get away with murder?
In ``A Slight Case of Murder'' (8 p.m. ET Sunday on TNT), a
pleasing, tongue-in-cheek suspense story, William H. Macy plays
Terry Thorpe, a film critic on cable television, the kind of man
who is seen peering down his nose over half-glasses in ads on the
sides of buses. Terry gets his chance to do more than critique
murder plots when he accidentally causes his girlfriend's death.
</P>
<P>
   As he explains in one of many wry asides to the camera, she
slipped on a ice cube during an argument and hit her head on the
coffee table. Sure. But seconds later we see that it happened just
that way. So why shouldn't life be like a movie?
</P>
<P>
   Terry tries to hide all evidence of his involvement in the death
because he has been two-timing his primary girlfriend. In a role
that echoes his delicious ``Fargo'' character, Macy is great fun to
watch as a guilty man trying to look innocent. (He was also the
film's co-writer, along with the its director, Steven Schacter;
they based the script on Donald E. Westlake's novel ``A
Travesty.'')
</P>
<P>
   The terrific cast also includes Felicity Huffman as the
girlfriend who lives, James Cromwell as a blackmailing private
investigator and Adam Arkin as a dense police detective. He invites
Terry home for dinner, cooked by a wife who seems to have walked
out of a 1950s Disney film. Nothing, of course, is what it seems.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the many movie references, including a glimpse of
``Gaslight'' and Terry's prominently displayed poster for ``In Cold
Blood,'' ``A Slight Case of Murder'' does not come with a
self-reflexive post-modern spin. The movies are merely a congenial
backdrop for this modest, amusing film.

   MEXICO CITY The mother of Mexico is becoming the mother of all
election squabbles.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's ruling party filed an official elections commission
complaint this week charging that Vicente Fox, a top presidential
rival, unlawfully exploited the image of Mexico's beloved Virgin of
Guadalupe for political gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't do that stuff with the Virgin,'' said political
analyst Raymundo Riva Palacio, commenting on the spat over the
Virgin.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint against Fox _ whom polls show is highly popular _
threatens to gnaw at him just as he is kicking off his official
campaign to oust Mexico's ruling Revolutionary Institutional Party,
or PRI, from the presidency after 70 years in power.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the PRI requested that Mexico's Federal Elections
Institute investigate whether Fox should be sanctioned or fined for
waving a banner of the Virgin of Guadalupe at a Sept. 10 political
rally.
</P>
<P>
   The battle began when Fox was holding a campaign rally that day
in Leon, in the state of Guanajuato, which he governed until
recently stepping down to pursue the presidency. Delegates
representing Mexico's conservative National Action Party, or PAN,
recently named Fox their nominee for Mexico's presidential election
on July 2, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   At the rally of some 5,000 people in Leon, Fox's children gave
him a banner as a gift. When he unfurled it publicly, it proved to
be an image of Mexico's Virgin of Guadalupe, topped with a
crucifix. Some reports say that Fox waved the banner and implied he
would carry on a battle for democracy begun in 1810 by the Mexican
priest Miguel Hidalgo.
</P>
<P>
   In Fox's home state of Guanajuato, Hidalgo exhorted the masses
to rise up and fight for independence against the Spanish, shouting
``Long live the Virgin of Guadalupe.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's action was a lightning rod for instant criticism in a
country that's at once deeply Catholic and deeply committed to
keeping religion out of most politics.
</P>
<P>
   One of Mexico's most beloved presidents, Benito Juarez, fought
in the 19th century to curb the power of the Catholic church, which
was seen as an ally of the Mexican elite. After the Mexican
revolution, Mexicans fought another civil war over the suppression
of priests and Catholic practices.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Mexican government has tried to strike a
balance, allowing religious freedom but forbidding religious
organizations from getting involved in politics and prohibiting
politicians from using religious symbols.
</P>
<P>
   The Virgin of Guadalupe is a potent symbol that goes beyond
religious faith. Legend has it she appeared to a Mexican Indian in
1531, instructing him to build a shrine in her honor. The Virgin
was dark-skinned and spoke to the Indian in his language _ details
that have fueled the Virgin's reputation as ``the mother of all
Mexicans'' and a symbol that cannot be claimed by any one political
group.
</P>
<P>
   Following Fox's use of the Virgin banner at a rally, Mexico's
interior secretary said Fox had shown ``an insolent lack of
respect,'' but he said he considered ``the case closed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church weighed in next, not condemning Fox but
gently chastising him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know to what end he's using the Virgin of Guadalupe,''
said Mexican Cardinal Norberto Rivera Carrera. ``I think we all
carry the Virgin of Guadalupe with us. He can do that too, but the
Virgin of Guadalupe belongs to all Mexicans and should not be used
for partisan purposes. She is the only thing that unites all
Mexicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the PAN have a reputation for being closer to
Catholic doctrine than other parties in Mexico. But Fox _ who is
running an anti-corruption, anti-PRI campaign _ has never been
viewed as promoting the church or Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he was forced to issue an apology, explaining that the
banner was gift from his children, who simply wanted to ``invoke
the protection of the Virgin . . . during my campaign for the
presidency of the Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not my intention to use this image as an instrument in
my campaign,'' he said.

ART REVIEW: OLD FRIEND, FOREVER MYSTERIOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A few years ago there was a traveling exhibition,
``Egyptomania,'' which showed how Greeks and Romans, then Italians,
French, Russians and Americans borrowed, copied and stole from
ancient Egypt, or what they believed was ancient Egypt because
after a while the copies and adaptations got mixed up with
originals and became part of the evolving culture.
</P>
<P>
   Obelisks, pyramids and all the other Egyptian-derived forms,
which for centuries, even before the great excavations of the 19th
century, permeated Western art and architecture (the Egyptian Hall
in London, the original Tombs in lower Manhattan, the old
suspension bridge over the Neva in St. Petersburg, the Pyramid at
the Louvre in Paris and on and on) proved that the Egyptians
succeeded, to a degree probably even they didn't anticipate, in
leaving a legacy to outlast themselves.
</P>
<P>
   A major show of Old Kingdom art, now at the Metropolitan Museum
of Art, easily gets the early vote for blockbuster of the fall
season. Organized at the museum by Dorothea Arnold and handsomely
installed, it's one of those spectacles, like the Byzantine,
Chinese and Mexican surveys that the Met has done in recent years,
that is not just about art but about a whole civilization. It
examines the first great epoch in Egypt, the 500 years from 2650
B.C. to 2150 B.C., which is really the high point of all ancient
Egyptian culture, when the pyramids were built and the canon of
Egyptian art was established. As well as any show, it demonstrates
why Egyptian art still holds an incredible fascination in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the number and popularity of exhibitions about New
Kingdom pharaohs like Tutankhamen and Amenhotep III, it's a little
surprising that this is actually the first big survey devoted to
Old Kingdom art, but evidently there hasn't been an excuse to do a
show until lately, and museums generally need some excuse for
moving around some of the oldest sculptures in history.
</P>
<P>
   The excuse here is that experts, who for a long time didn't pay
much attention to the Old Kingdom because it seemed like a settled
subject, have been fiddling with the chronology of some of the
objects on view. Those of us who aren't Egyptologists will simply
be grateful for the chance to peruse work that, aside from being
astonishingly beautiful, has continued to seem over thousands of
years mysteriously impenetrable and familiar at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt this is a reason for Egypt's fascination: its
paradoxical status in our imagination. We think of Egypt as both
complex (hieroglyphs, religion) and, in a formal sense, rudimentary
(the pyramids). Children, for instance, are always drawn, as if
genetically programmed, to the Egyptian section of a museum because
Egyptian art seems immediately understandable to them. To a child
learning to read, hieroglyphs are colorful, eye-catching pictures,
unlike letters of the alphabet, and Egyptian statues, with their
predictable, straightforward attitude toward the viewer, look like
people pared down to basic forms, which is how a child is inclined
to draw.
</P>
<P>
   Adults admire the same art for opposite reasons: it seems
abstract and sophisticated in the sense that we know it depends on
a remote philosophy of nature, religion, authority, class, beauty
and death. Adults always say how Egyptian art looks modern, by
which we really mean that modern art has evolved complicated forms
of abstraction, symbolism and linear representation, many of which
ultimately descend from the Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
   The art is abstract and illusionistic simultaneously. A landmark
of the Old Kingdom from the Fourth Dynasty (2575-2465 B.C.) is the
famous seated statue of Hemiunu, the prince and vizier in charge of
building the Great Pyramid. It's one of the first things that
occupies your attention in the show. Hemiunu is kind of a pyramid
himself, a triangular mass of limestone, life size,
straight-backed, feet firmly planted side by side, hands resting on
his lap, one palm down, the other closed, with a look on his face
of divine indifference.
</P>
<P>
   And he's fat _ his large breasts two grapefruits, his huge arms
slack over a frame that, to judge by his head, seems barely
sufficient for his size, his undulating belly sagging under the
weight of his flesh. (You see this best straight on.) A different
portrait of him, a small profile in relief, also in the show, makes
him look more youthful, less forbidding but still fine-featured and
strong-jawed, so that between the two versions we feel we have some
idea of what he actually may have looked like.
</P>
<P>
   This was the essence of Egyptian portraiture: to find a way,
within strict parameters, to convey particularity _ to combine, in
a sense, what one knows with what one sees. Accurate observation
was necessary to fulfill the immortalizing function of Egyptian art
_ to be a true embodiment of the person in stone through eternity _
but observation always had to be modified by convention.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   You could say that this remark applies to all art, which it
does, but with Egyptian art the limits of convention were unusually
specific. The standard Egyptian relief portrait, as it came to be
established during the Old Kingdom, required each part of the body
to be presented in strict proportion, with its essential aspect to
the viewer (shoulders forward, head turned, legs sideways and
striding). An icon of Egyptian art, anatomically impossible, it's
also a strangely lifelike arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   The artist who carved the relief of Hesi-re, the Third Dynasty
(2649-2575 B.C.) scribe, found a way to obey this formula without
being formulaic and to make us see someone in particular: a tall,
slender young man, serious, with alert eyes, high cheekbones,
hooked nose, narrow mouth, faint mustache and sinewy arms.
</P>
<P>
   We have no idea who the artist was, but while artists didn't
carve their own names into these sculptures, we can tell the good
workshops from the less good ones: the workshop, say, that
sculptured the triad of the Fourth Dynasty king, Menkaure with two
goddesses, as opposed to the one that made the little statues of
Inti-Shedu, an artisan _ although they both convey a humane
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most memorable works aren't the biggest or the
fanciest, in fact; they're sculptures like the one of Iai-ib and
Khuaut, husband and wife, side by side.
</P>
<P>
   She is a little behind him, shorter and standing so close to him
that her right breast presses against his arm. You can make out her
body beneath her sheath dress _ the belly, thighs, hip bones and
back. It's the back that makes the sculpture special: her arm
reaches around him, her hand on his shoulder, an intimate detail
that comes as a particular surprise because it's invisible from the
front. We err to think of Egyptian art as monotonous, even
monotonous in a stately, incantatory way (a common remark). More
accurate is to say that it's an art of subtle variation, especially
impressive for operating within such a strict code.
</P>
<P>
   The Old Kingdom peaked artistically during the Fourth and Fifth
Dynasties (together 2575-2323 B.C.). From the Sixth Dynasty are the
famous statue of Queen Ankh-nes-meryre II with her son, Pepi II,
fully grown in miniature form, sitting on her lap (every mother's
dream), and various standing wood figures of seal bearers, slim,
muscular, vacant-faced, a little toylike but elegant in silhouette.
Still, the essential forms of Egyptian art were in place earlier,
when they more clearly expressed the central Egyptian paradigms of
permanence and immobility.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian art, after all, was ultimately about death, or more to
the point, it was about eternal life after death, about achieving a
suspended state of grace (another source of Egypt's eternal
fascination for us). What remains of Old Kingdom Egypt are tombs,
or objects from tombs, which represented and recreated the lives of
the people buried. As the textbooks always remind us, Egyptians
made stone sculptures not for the sake of art as we think of it
today but as a duplicate of the living world to be occupied by the
dead, or to be precise about it, by their ka, the life force.
Sculptures of the pharaohs were permanent bodies made of stone to
replace the flesh ones they left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Egyptians say that their houses are only temporary
lodgings and their graves are their real houses,'' is how Diodorus
Siculus, the ancient Greek historian, famously put it (although he
might have added that this sufficed nicely for kings, queens and
high officials with big graves, while for the masses of Egyptians,
home for eternity was a shallow pit).
</P>
<P>
   It's a final, intriguing paradox that an art about death should
teem with so much life. As Ms. Arnold, the curator, writes, ``The
essence of Old Kingdom art is joy in life,'' which is exactly
right. The show is full of paintings, relief scenes and small
sculptures of contented laborers, fishermen, musicians and cooks.
Men and women are always made to look beautiful, even when they're
fat or old or dwarfs; Egyptians depicted everyone with a respect
for the diversity of humanity.
</P>
<P>
   They embraced the ordinary in the afterlife, something that
separates their view of life from our notions of death, which are
fixated on heaven, hell and oblivion. Time after time in the
exhibition, in the way that one experiences small epiphanies by
being alert to what happens all the time on the street, our
attention is drawn to little details from the everyday world: the
sexy torso of Lady Hetep-heres, a statue from the Fourth Dynasty;
two orioles fighting, from a Fifth Dynasty limestone panel; sailors
on a ship, from a relief of the late Fourth Dynasty or early Fifth
Dynasty. The artist who carved that scene demonstrates the
Egyptians' mastery of abstract line drawing, the image being a
complicated crisscross of ropes, oars, legs and masts; even the
water under the boat is made into a kind of braid, jewel-like.
</P>
<P>
   And this is what the best Old Kingdom art is about: conveying
the basic elegance and pleasure of everyday forms in a form that
is, itself, elegant. One relief in the show has a herd of cattle
crossing a canal. The herd is lined up in a strict row except for a
cow in front whose head rears to lick her calf riding on the back
of a herdsman. It's a herdsman's trick for coaxing cows through
water: the mother will follow the calf and the herd will follow
her.
</P>
<P>
   The calf here turns around and touches its tongue to its
mother's tongue. An ordinary image becomes something else. The
panel was carved for the tomb of a high Sixth Dynasty official
named Ni-ankh-nesut and is a funerary monument to sweet life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Egyptian Art in the Age of the Pyramids'' remains at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82d Street, (212)
535-7710, through Jan. 9.

 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Don't be alarmed by that toilet at the center of the
stage. True, the fact that it is dramatically spotlighted in blue
in the opening seconds of ``Do You Come Here Often?,'' the
ecstatically inane two-man show at Performance Space 122, would
seem to portend an evening of the most adolescent sort of blue
humor. And anyone who has sat through this summer's comic movie
blockbusters has certainly had enough toilet jokes for a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Yet aside from a mild reference to the effects of eating soap on
the digestive system, there is nothing here at all reminiscent of
the gross-out fare of ``South Park'' and ``American Pie.'' The
toilet in ``Do You Come Here Often?,'' performed by two inspired
British comedians, Sean Foley and Hamish McColl, is used for more
exotic purposes. They involve, among other things, an all-important
door key, some bright yellow toy ducks and a miraculous garden of
artificial flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Jozef Houben, ``Often'' provides winning
confirmation that when it comes to doing pure silliness, nobody
beats the British. Bringing to mind antecedents ranging from early
music hall teams to the giddy surrealism of Monty Python, this tale
of two men trapped together in a bathroom (with pastel fixtures, no
less) piles absurdities so high that you can't imagine the whole
thing won't topple into a shambles.
</P>
<P>
   But Foley and McColl, who work under the name the Right Size and
won a Laurence Olivier Award for this production, know perfectly
well that comic chaos requires the utmost precision. There's an air
of free-associating delirium in ``Often,'' a sense of jokes and
gags forever breeding mutant progeny, but you never feel that the
slightly seedy-looking clowns on stage aren't in total control. And
while they definitely have an original comic voice, their style is
also as classic as commedia dell'arte.
</P>
<P>
   The show's central premise is both simple and outlandish, and it
evokes memories of more somber theatrical fare, especially such
existential heavyweights as ``No Exit,'' ``Waiting for Godot'' and
Harold Pinter's ``Dumbwaiter.'' David Seymore (McColl) and Kevin
Kevin (Sean Foley) _ and these are not, the characters would like
you to know, their real names _ waken to find themselves bound and
gagged, locked in a pink-and-blue eyesore of a bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   The men don't know each other, and they don't remember how they
got there. Presumably they are the victims, as David says with grim
relish, of ``dark forces that are yet to reveal themselves.'' The
key to the door is found quickly and, of course, just as quickly
lost. And thus begins a strained cohabitation that will last for
the next quarter of a century.
</P>
<P>
   Hewing to the rules of comedy team basics, a la Laurel and Hardy
or Abbott and Costello, the show presents characters of distinctly
different ilks and hence destined to annoy each other. David, who
wears a morning suit (he has come from a wedding reception), is a
party boy with an overdeveloped sense of whimsy, a bit like Dudley
Moore in ``Arthur.'' His life, he recalls bleakly, involved ``an
awful lot of yachting...pretty much endless yachting.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Kevin (his ``secret middle name'' is Kevin) is a more
salt-of-the-earth sort, wearing street clothes over his pajamas,
who after much hesitation sums up his earlier existence by saying,
``I tend to watch a lot of television.'' These details, by the way,
emerge only after the men have been together for a number of years.
And that's well before they think about pooling their resources, a
carton of milk and a single egg. The egg later shows up atop a
strange piece of headgear worn by McColl, which Foley matches by
wearing a similar contraption topped by a hammer.
</P>
<P>
   Does any of this sound funny to you? Probably not. And it is
probably to the credit of the Right Size that its hilarity doesn't
translate into synopsis. Yet having seen ``Often,'' I find myself
laughing as I write these things down, marveling that jokes that
were repeated again and again seemed to acquire new punch with each
delivery. (My favorite, and please don't ask me to explain, was
Foley's exquisitely timed rendering of the words ``Hello, Mrs.
Spicer.'')
</P>
<P>
   And while the evening's prevailing spirit may sound anarchic, it
represents a canny balance of disparate comic elements. These range
from the hoariest of puns and sight gags (``I can't believe you're
still doing this sort of material,'' Foley grumbles more than once)
to stories within stories of Borgesian complexity and periodic
leaps into the past. In the process the evening becomes a wily
commentary on the ways people mark and kill time. The games the men
play, for the record, range from the tedious ``find the dot''
(Kevin's choice) to the impersonation of bees and flowers (David's
favorite).
</P>
<P>
   The feeling of dizziness mounts as the show keeps calling
attention to its artificial nature. The door that stands between
the men and the outside world can be picked up and carried around,
and the passage of years is indicated by a set of increasingly long
cloth beards with elastic bands. Such devices are used without
winking self-consciousness; unreality is an accepted part of
reality. As the show nears the end of its 70 minutes, the
adversarial prisoners achieve a state of harmony that is pure
show-business rhapsody. It takes the form of a music-hall-style
duet (by Chris Larner), accessorized with pastel canes, that
centers on the gleefully iterated phrase, ``We're both dead.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an enchanted moment, a reminder of how classic comedy finds
redeeming form in life's frustrations, the logic in its illogic.
The song, of course, is one of the silliest you've ever heard. But
by that point, having followed Foley and McColl through 25 years of
slapstick and non sequiturs, you somehow feel that everything
suddenly makes absolute sense.
</P>

`THE PEKING LETTER,' A SILLY BUT LIVELY EXTRAVAGANZA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MAUREEN CORRIGAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In what surely must be a bow to Graham Greene, Seymour Topping
dubs ``The Peking Letter,'' his novel about the Chinese Communist
revolution, ``an entertainment.'' Early in his writing career,
Greene used that term to refer to his thrillers; later he came to
rue that label because for many years the academic literary
establishment followed his lead and dismissed those
``entertainments,'' classic suspense novels like ``The Ministry of
Fear'' and ``The Third Man,'' as piffle. In the case of ``The
Peking Letter,'' however, the designation ``entertainment'' may be
less of an albatross than a shrewd antidote to critical venom.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, as this reader snorted at the panting dialogue,
melodramatic chapter endings and whopping coincidences that compose
Topping's novel, the cheery label ``entertainment'' admonished her
to lighten up and enjoy this silly but undeniably lively
extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Peking Letter'' is about love among the ruins of war, in
this case the Chinese civil war of the late 1940's when the armies
of Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong battled for control of the
country. The story opens in October 1948 in Peking. Mao's troops
are massing outside the city; inside, Chiang's forces have been
ordered to fight to the death. Without diplomatic (or authorial)
intervention, a bloody siege will ensue that will surely destroy
not only countless lives, but also the artistic treasures and
imperial buildings that grace the old capital.
</P>
<P>
   As history tells us, Peking was spared when the general
commanding the Nationalist troops surrendered to the Communists.
Topping knows of this turn of events from firsthand witness. He
covered the Chinese civil war as a correspondent for The Associated
Press before moving in 1959 to The New York Times, where he served
as a foreign correspondent in Moscow and Hong Kong and rose to
managing editor. In his preface, Topping admits that although his
account of events in the novel is drawn from his reportorial
experience, most of his characters and their adventures are
figments of his imagination. The biggest figment of them all is a
tall, red-haired American named Eric Jensen who, in this fantasy
revision of history, singlehandedly saves Peking _ as Beijing was
then known to Westerners _ from destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen is an unlikely young man to play the role of Great White
Hope. A scholar in residence at the Peking Language School, where
he is researching Taoist philosophy, Jensen cultivates a taste for
hot Chinese antiquities, yellow wine and the joy of girls at the
House of Three Pleasures. Nor is the latter pursuit Jensen's only
undercover work. He has been blackmailed into the role of spy for
the CIA: his mission dictates that he gain the confidence of
left-leaning students and intellectuals in order to provide
information that will ease a rapprochement between the U.S.
government and the Chinese Communists after the Communists come
into power.
</P>
<P>
   So how does Jensen save Peking? His heroic adventures begin when
he falls in love with a beautiful pro-Communist medical student who
goes by the English name Lilian. She and her compatriots ask Jensen
to carry a letter to the American ambassador in Nanking requesting
him to persuade Chiang Kai-shek's more open-minded vice president,
Gen. Li Tsung-jen, to authorize the surrender of Peking. Besotted
with Lilian, Jensen agrees to the mission in characteristically
overheated verbal style: ``Yes. ... I'll do it. Of course, I'll do
it. ... for her, for Peking.'' Soon Jensen is dashing hither and
yon about the country, being pursued by his outraged CIA controls
as well as by secret police from the Kuomingtang, Chiang's
Nationalist Party, led by an evil mixed-race fellow known as ``The
Blue-Eyed One.''
</P>
<P>
   For a gangly redhead at large in China, Jensen somehow manages
to blend into the crowd well enough to thwart capture again and
again. The plot of ``The Peking Letter'' strains as badly as a pair
of chopsticks maneuvering to pick up a mandarin orange. The novel's
characters are uniformly underdeveloped, a problem common to the
plot-driven thriller that its close cousin, the detective story,
sometimes overcomes through the serial unfolding of its main
characters. As one would expect from an old China hand like
Topping, however, the novel does offer a sweeping view of China on
the verge of a cataclysmic change. Readers glimpse the effects of
war and revolution on the lives of characters ranging from Ying the
pedicab man to the many Western expatriates living the good life in
China. Topping is evenhanded to a fault in his political cynicism.
Neither the Nationalists nor the Communists win any points for
compassion; ditto the plutocrats versus the peasants.
</P>
<P>
   We learn that Lilian's father plans to scoot off to the United
States with his ill-gotten bank profits; a few chapters on, we
witness peasants stealing rice from the bedsides of wounded
soldiers. Equating the stealing of the nation's resources by the
banker class that supported the Nationalists with the petty crimes
of hungry peasants implicitly denies how greatly the revolution,
whatever its excesses, bettered the lives of millions of Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   In a world this grim, love offers the only solace. To his
credit, Topping keeps readers guessing until his novel's final
pages as to whether the fate of his wartime sweethearts will more
closely resemble that of their besieged romantic counterparts in
Ernest Hemingway's sodden ``Farewell to Arms'' or Herman Wouk's
more upbeat ``Winds of War.'' As for the Chinese Communist
revolution, whose 50th anniversary is being observed this fall, its
outcome _ indeed like its appellation _ is still evolving.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to Beijing in June, my Chinese guide corrected me
when I referred to ``the revolution.'' ``Not revolution,'' the
guide said. ``True Founding of the Nation.'' Revolution, she
explained, was a somewhat distasteful term of uncertain political
pedigree, more befitting the student uprising in Tiananmen Square
than the righteous rise of Mao and his followers to power. We
nodded at each other and kept the peace.

   OUTSIDE PROVIDENCE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Hatosy, Alec Baldwin, Jon Abrahams, Jack Ferver, Amy
Smart, Tim Crowe, George Wendt &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Michael Corrente &QL;
</P>
<P>
   R 95 minutes
</P>
<P>
   In the grittier precincts of Pawtucket, R.I., the year is 1974,
the paint is peeling off the porch, and young Tim Dunphy ( Hatosy)
is getting drunk and stoned a little too regularly to suit his
father, the blustery and bigoted Old Man Dunphy ( Baldwin). A year
away at prep school might straighten Tim out. ``Prep. Prepare you
to not get your neck broken by me,'' says the old man.
</P>
<P>
   A Dunphy friend donates the tuition, and Tim, his meager
personal effects slung over his shoulder in a trash bag, is on the
bus to Cornwall Academy in leafiest Connecticut. Awaiting him is a
stereotypical assortment of hidebound, vindictive school
authorities and repressed prep schoolers, who help Tim into the
required shirt and tie (a clip-on) and escort him to class.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring Hamlet his favorite author, Tim hasn't the slightest
idea what is going on. Luckily he's an engaging, resilient boy who
sticks to Pawtucket values and takes Cornwall as it comes. That
attracts Jane (Ms. Smart), a top student and good person at
Cornwall's girls division, who supplies friendship, romance and,
though Tim professes to study efficiently only when high, steady
help with his schoolwork.
</P>
<P>
   At home Old Man Dunphy, ever the skeptic about such upscale
endeavors despite having encouraged them, sits around with his pals
playing cards while they all stoke their homophobia. Beneath the
guarded crustiness, he loves his boy, though he won't discuss the
death of Tim's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile back on campus an accumulation of rules infractions
having to do with drugs and girls in boy's rooms undoes Jane's
acceptance to Brown and threatens to send Tim back to Pawtucket.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE Some schoolboy scuffling. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX At school there is much talk about sex, and a boy
masturbates, heard but not seen in the dark. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY Obscenities fly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOOTNOTE The film's primary sin is the heavy use of drugs and
alcohol at home and at school. And homosexuals are not spoken
kindly of in the Dunphy kitchen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 12 AND 13 This is a very appealing film for viewers this
age, with two strong, positive central characters as bona fide role
models, their pot smoking notwithstanding. But parents may well
have objections on other grounds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 14 AND UP An R-rated film for all the usual reasons, but it
transcends the form for a change and becomes a worthwhile
experience. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE MUSE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Albert Brooks, Sharon Stone, Andie MacDowell, Mark Feurstein,
Jeff Bridges &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Albert Brooks &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 97 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You had a great career,'' a crass young studio executive (
Feurstein) tells the screenwriter Steven Phillips ( Brooks). Maybe
it's time to try television. Anyway, Steven's movie-writing deal is
terminated, and he has minutes to get off the lot. Brian De Palma
needs his office.
</P>
<P>
   With a wife (Ms. MacDowell), children and a major screenwriterly
house to maintain in Hollywood fashion, Phillips is desperate.
Spielberg grants him a meeting: Stan Spielberg, that is, who
himself hasn't seen the other Spielberg in more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   When all looks darkest, Phillips' friend Jack Warrick (
Bridges), another screenwriter, who lives in a chateau and is
obviously cooking on all cylinders, has a suggestion. There's a
woman he consults from time to time, a muse (Ms. Stone), who if she
is treated right can inspire a man to do his best work. Better
even.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is she from? Greece?'' Jack asks. Actually her name is
Sarah, and she'll go to work filling Jack's head with great
concepts. In return he is to put her up in a suite at the Four
Seasons Hotel at $1,700 a night.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah, who is good company despite abruptly shifting whims and
demands, starts Phillips working on a comedy about an aquarium.
Just as fruitfully, she soon has his wife, Laura, making
sensational cookies that sell by the ton at places like Spago.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Sarah moves into the Phillips house and bosses Steven all
over the place while she and Laura have a great time hustling
cookies to all the right people. A desperate Martin Scorsese, in
one of several cameos by film people, shows up desperately needing
advice from Sarah on a new project. A couple of psychologists from
Ohio also appear, and they have quite a different take on the
muse. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX Almost eerily, none, though Sarah hops into bed nude, and
alone, and Phillips has a notion that Laura is attracted to her. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY A few mild vulgarities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 11 There is really nothing here to interest them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11-13 Some children will be attracted to the movie talk,
Hollywood ambiance, sitcom situations and attractive characters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 14 AND UP The film is pretty far from normal teen-age fare,
obviously, but many will like it and it does make pleasant and
harmless entertainment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MICKEY BLUE EYES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Grant, Jeanne Tripplehorn, James Caan, Burt Young, James
Fox, Joe Viterelli &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Kelly Makin &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 102 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Double murder. Vito Graziosi. ``Ring any bells?'' asks Gina
Vitale (Ms. Tripplehorn), who is explaining the facts of life to
the cultivated, mild-mannered Englishman, Michael Felgate ( Grant).
Michael, who smoothly wields the gavel at an art auction house, has
asked Gina to marry him. Gina at first demurs because she's the
daughter of a mobster ( Caan) who, along with ``relatives'' like
Graziosi, will try to control their lives forever.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, Michael wants to proceed, and so he becomes
kissing buddies with the Graziosis and the Vitales. In some
respects it's a good move. Usually surly and late with their
deliveries to the auction house, truck drivers suddenly arrive
ahead of time and are actually civil. Sotheby's, Michael's chief
competition, has a fire.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a down side. Michael's future in-laws start using
the auction process to do a little money laundering. The FBI wants
to use the wedding ceremony to nail Graziosi. As for Michael and
the nuptials, Gina wants out. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE A gangland figure is shot and left in a pool of blood.
Otherwise there is the threat of violence and some phony gore, but
all is in the spirit of a Mafia comedy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY Occasional dirty talk. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 11 No for all kinds of reasons but primarily because
the film would be a total bore for most children. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 12 AND UP Teen-agers will yawn, but if they have seen
everything else and still feel a need to go to the movies, this one
will do.

TALK RADIO RINGS WITH DENUNCIATIONS OF CHURCH SHOOTINGS _ BUT NOT
OF GUNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAX B. BAKER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ On talk radio Thursday, discussions centered
on God's grace, senseless violence and the prospect of Larry Gene
Ashbrook burning in hell.
</P>
<P>
   Talk show hosts Mark Davis and Billy Hayes joined their callers
in venting about gun control, the news media and the decay of
society.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at life as a Monopoly game, the people Ashbrook killed
and wounded in a Fort Worth church don't ``have to pass Go, don't
have to collect $200; you go straight to heaven,'' said Hayes, who
calls himself ``Humble Billy Hayes'' on his talk show on KLIF AM.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook ``goes straight to hell,'' Hayes said. ``May you burn
in perdition, Larry Gene Ashbrook.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasting live from outside Wedgwood Baptist Church, WBAP
AM's Davis described the crime scene with its yellow police tape,
the remote TV and radio vans and the endless stream of gawkers.
</P>
<P>
   Hypothesizing about what may have happened at the church
Wednesday night and what may have been in Ashbrook's mind, Davis
said: ``Let's frame it this way: Some people are just evil. We ask
the question, `Why?' ... Sometimes, there is no reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Jones on KRLD AM interviewed reporters, hospital
officials and members of the Fort Worth bomb squad. One of his
first callers attacked TV stations as being too intrusive in the
tragic first moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are clowns,'' said a caller who identified
himself as Jim.
</P>
<P>
   Another caller, Art, told Jones that the news media shouldn't
``glorify'' people like Ashbrook by using their names on television
and radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are going to check out like that, they don't deserve
to be remembered for jack,'' Art said.
</P>
<P>
   Any attempt to use the shootings as justification to impose
stricter gun control laws was vehemently rejected by callers to
Davis' and Hayes' shows. Both hosts said the tragedy might been
averted if the churchgoers ``had been packing.''
</P>
<P>
   Callers especially took exception to comments that Vice
President Al Gore made during an interview on ``Good Morning
America,'' in which he said something obviously must be done about
the proliferation of guns.
</P>
<P>
   Dave, who said he is a 20-year-old law enforcement officer, told
Davis: ``Another liberal blames the gun and not the criminal ...
I've never seen a gun jump up and shoot anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   On Hayes' show, however, Eugene disagreed, asking, ``why do we
need automatic weapons that can destroy seven lives'' so quickly?

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For some time now, the Miss America pageant that
comes to your television screen Saturday has had pretensions of
being more cerebral than it really is _ which is simply a
long-running beauty contest, a throwback to a more quaint, innocent
era.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers have tried to stress that the winner must have a
talent for something (almost anything will do), special community
interests that demonstrate compassion and the brains to talk
lucidly to an interviewer. They actually call their body-baring
swimsuit segment a display of ``physical fitness in swimwear.''
There will always be a public relations person.
</P>
<P>
   These surface cosmetics don't kid anyone, however. We all know
the basic appeal is the opportunity to ogle gorgeous, shapely young
women prancing around in sexy outfits.
</P>
<P>
   Pageant officials have suddenly provoked a public uproar by
deciding to expand the pool of eligible beauties. They eliminated
the rigid ban against a prior divorce or abortion, recognizing that
many modern, unmarried young women have active sex lives. The idea
was to encourage more entrants, whose numbers have been dwindling
lately.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think that parading naked down the runway wearing nothing
but the ubiquitous stiletto heels had suddenly become the preferred
standard. Outraged protesters screamed that the pageant was ruined
and the winner's image as the American ideal of virginal purity was
compromised. Sex, the previously unspoken lure, had unmistakably
surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   The most dogmatic critics trashed young women who have fled
unhappy, sometimes abusive marriages or ended a pregnancy they
feared would ruin their lives physically, emotionally or mentally
if carried to term. ``We've gotten away from morals,'' Mary
Richardson, executive director of the rival Mrs. America
International Pageant, sniffed. ``Wrong is wrong and right is
right.''
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't about morals, or even perpetuating a mythical
feminine ``ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all marriages and pregnancies are idyllic. Some are terrible
experiences that cannot be tolerated. No outsider can fairly judge
another individual's morality when it comes to decisions about
personal sanity and survival.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, this is really about the politics of the religious
right. Any suggestion that abortion _ a legal procedure, after all
_ is not totally immoral and impermissible under any circumstances
drives the hard-right activists to the microphones, the lecterns,
the courtrooms and the ballot boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Some state pageant directors have sued the central organization
to revoke the change. The pageant's chief executive, Robert Beck,
capitulated to the pressure by postponing the revisions until he
can assess the scope of the rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying notion that the Miss America contest is among
innocent, wholesome young women free of self-centered ambition or
artifice who would be corrupted by competing against a divorcee is
silly on its face. This is a business, for which there are
financial and psychological rewards. To get to the finals, these
women have to be pros at the game.
</P>
<P>
   They come well-packaged, taping their breasts together for
deeper cleavage, plying on shiny stuff to make their eyes and lips
glisten, subjecting their bodies to expensive personal trainers,
studying boring current events and paying for the most expensive,
form-fitting gowns they can find.
</P>
<P>
   Why should they be forever held up as sweet little milkmaids,
when they so obviously are not? And why is their private life
anybody's business, so long as they have no criminal record?
</P>
<P>
   The Miss America pageant should simply follow the pattern set by
the military to deal with the issue of gays in its ranks. ``Don't
ask, don't tell'' is the right solution for everyone. We are a
tolerant, secular society.
</P>
<P>
   Under the armed forces policy, privacy is important so long as
personal habits are not advertised to the world at large or
interfere with job performance. The policy isn't working perfectly,
but it seems to be a sensible, if uncomfortable, compromise.
</P>
<P>
   What do the beauty pageant protesters want? Gynecological exams
of every contestant to prove her sexual status?
</P>
<P>
   Who cares, really? This is not an election for leader of the
free world or even local councilperson. It is a rivalry of physical
beauty, the concept of which itself has changed over the decades to
include minorities and disabilities that once would have been
considered imperfections.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a shame if the self-appointed moralists scare
pageant officials into retreating into a decorative but ultimately
fake world that no longer exists, or even interests us very much.
What if they gave a certifiably virginal pageant and nobody came?

killing at least 17 people and wounding more than 100. It was the
fourth bomb attack on an apartment block in Russia in the past two
weeks _ attacks widely blamed on Islamic militants _ that have

life. The former Mexican drug prosecutor _ accused of accepting
drug money bribes _ was about to go to trial in the United States
in a case that could have revealed more sordid secrets of

CLINTON INVOKES EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE IN CLEMENCY CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton invoked executive privilege
Thursday to bar administration officials from publicly discussing
his offer of clemency to 16 Puerto Rican militants or releasing
government documents related to his decision.
</P>
<P>
   The move incensed congressional Republicans who have repeatedly
called on the president to explain his reasons for granting
clemency to members of the FALN, initials for the Spanish name of
the Armed Forces of National Liberation.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy White House counsel Cheryl Mills said in a letter to the
House Government Reform Committee that Congress had no authority to
overturn the president's clemency decision and, therefore, has no
right to investigate how that decision was made.
</P>
<P>
   Executive privilege is a claim by the president or a high
administration official that he or she should not be forced to
testify because it could hamper effective decision-making by the
president. Mills said Clinton needed to invoke the privilege in
this case to ``assure that the president receives candid advice
from his advisers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the committee, which has
held hearings into the clemency issue, said the president has a
``moral obligation'' to explain his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``By claiming executive privilege, he is, in essence, telling
the American people that it's none of their business,'' Burton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans and members of the law enforcement community
have accused Clinton of offering clemency to the Puerto Rican
nationalists to help his wife's all-but-announced Senate candidacy
from New York where some 1.3 million Puerto Ricans are eligible to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Several administration officials had been scheduled to testify
Monday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's terrorism
subcommittee about their recommendations to the president on
whether the Puerto Ricans should be granted clemency.
</P>
<P>
   However, late Sunday night, the Justice Department ordered the
officials not to appear before the committee.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Burton's committee subpoenaed officials from the
FBI, the Justice Department and the White House to testify at a
Thursday hearing on the clemency issue. The Senate Judiciary
Committee also said it would issue subpoenas for documents and
testimony regarding the clemency case, according to the committee's
chairman, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   The subpoenas left the White House with the choice of either
allowing the officials to testify or invoking executive privilege
to block their testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the legal advice of the attorney general, the president
is invoking executive privilege over certain documents and
testimony relating to the grant of clemency,'' said Jim Kennedy,
spokesman for the White House counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the White House would release some 10,000 pages of
documents related to the clemency decision, including thousands of
letters exhorting the president to show leniency toward the
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   But documents ``directly related to the exercise of the
president's constitutional authority are not being provided,''
Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   This marks the fourth time that Clinton has asserted executive
privilege to withhold testimony or documents from Congress,
according to Justice Department records. He asserted executive
privilege three times in 1996: when Congress demanded documents
related to the White House travel office firings, a joint FBI-Drug
Enforcement Agency memo to Clinton on drug enforcement, and
foreign-policy documents on the administration's Haiti policy.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also has asserted executive privilege in
litigation and independent counsel investigations, most notably
when Clinton sought to shield his deliberations with aides and
lawyers from Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation into
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1974, the FALN has been linked to 130 bombings that killed
six people _ including four police officers _ and maimed dozens of
others. In addition, the group was involved in a number of armed
assaults against government buildings and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   However, none of the 16 Puerto Ricans offered clemency by
Clinton was directly linked to bombings that caused injuries or
fatalities, a point the president has cited in explaining his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 16 FALN members offered clemency, which required them to
renounce violence, 14 accepted and two declined.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Senate voted 95 to 2 for a resolution calling
the clemency decision ``deplorable.'' The House passed a similar
measure last week by a 311-41 vote.
</P>
<P>
   The votes have no actual impact on the clemency granted to the
Puerto Rican militants since Congress has no constitutional
authority to overturn the offers.
</P>
<P>
   The president has insisted that politics played no role in the
clemency and that he was swayed in large part by the lengthy prison
terms _ nearly 20 years in several cases _ already served by the
FALN members.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton extended the offer after a lengthy review by former
White House chief counsel, Charles F.C. Ruff, according to the
White House. Prominent human rights advocates, including South
African Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu and former President Jimmy
Carter, backed the move.
</P>
<P>
   But law enforcement organizations and former FBI agents who have
investigated the FALN strongly criticized the clemency offers.
</P>
<P>
   Gibert G. Gallegos, president of the Grand Lodge, Fraternal
Order of Police, the nation's largest law enforcement organization
with more than 283,000 members, told a Senate committee on
Wednesday that the president had ``used his constitutional power to
release unrepentant terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   Former FBI Special Agent Richard Hahn, who investigated FALN
attacks from 1975 to 1987, told the committee that the president's
decision sends a ``frightening message'' to terrorists that the
United States is not serious about protecting its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   At the same hearing, Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., who has
urged Mrs. Clinton to seek the Senate seat, lashed out at the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret greatly the actions of President Clinton,''
Torricelli said. ``I hope the committee will learn more about his
motivations and the process so that it's never repeated.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a poll released Thursday showed that half of New York
state voters disapprove of Clinton's clemency decision, while only
12 percent approved.
</P>
<P>
   The Quinnipiac College poll of 911 New York State registered
voters, which was conducted September 7-13, found that another 35
percent said they don't know enough about the subject to offer an
opinion.

AN UNFLINCHING LOOK AT POSTREVOLUTIONARY MEXICO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DICK REAVIS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thursday, the day on which Mexico celebrates its independence
from Spain, the Dallas Museum of Art opened ``Indigenismo to
Modernism: Art in Postrevolutionary Mexico, 1920-50,'' a 58-piece
exhibition that will run through Feb. 13. In the spirit of its 30
artists and their subject matter, entry to the show is free.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit, drawn mostly from the holdings of Texas collectors
and institutions, highlights artwork on paper: lithographs,
photographs, wood and linoleum cuts, with a half-dozen canvases
thrown in for good measure. Muralists Diego Rivera, David Alfaro
Siqueiros and Jos Clemente Orozco headline the exhibit, which
includes works by Frida Kahlo and Rufino Tamayo. But the best works
are by unheralded figures. Even the work of a handful of
foreigners, mostly photographers, makes the show: Prints by Edward
Weston and Laura Gilpin, both Americans, and Frenchman Henri
Cartier-Bresson, are among the works on display.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indigenismo'' is a word whose literal meaning is
``indigenism,'' a term nonexistent but comprehensible in English.
It roughly means ``Indianism,'' and it came into use during
Mexico's frustrated attempts to define a national character.
Between about 1920 and 1950, Mexican intellectuals and artists felt
that, thanks to the Revolution of 1910, their country had become
truly independent for the first time since the Spanish conquest.
They wanted to give independence a cultural stamp. Their school of
thought, predominant then and not entirely defeated today, held
that Mexico was a non-Western nation, rooted in indigenous or
Indian culture _ a culture oppressed by, and corrupted by, its
mixture with European influences.
</P>
<P>
   To introduce viewers to the context of the era, curator Cheryl
Hartup recruited three lithographs on a common theme, the persona
of the revolutionary martyr Emiliano Zapata, and hung them side by
side. These lithos, by Mexico's most famous muralists, make a good
starting point for viewing the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   As if to stress his grandeur, in the depiction by Siqueiros,
Zapata sits atop an undersize horse, with mountains the size of
molehills in the background. Orozco's Zapata litho consists of
hundreds of men in broad-brimmed sombreros, seemingly shuffling
along together, most with heads bowed, in ignorance or weariness or
humility _ or all three. Those whose faces are visible have
bug-eyed visages, like caricatures of their leader. Rivera's
Zapata, by contrast, stands dismounted in the stiff pose of a
European saint, a Spanish conqueror underfoot _ and even his horse
looks noble. Two of these renditions come from veterans of the
Revolution _ Siqueiros and Orozco. Rivera, who is widely criticized
as romanticizing Mexico's past, spent the revolutionary period in
France and Spain, much of it in the warrens of European cubists.
</P>
<P>
   Historical iconography is not of concern to many Americans, but
there is something in the DMA exhibit for everyone. Even those who
don't know Zapata from ``zapato'' will be taken by a portrait of a
young woman from the Tehauntepec region, in a crimson festival
dress. The picture, in ink and gouache, is by Miguel Covarrubias, a
man whose name is a mouthful in any language but whose contribution
to ``Indigenismo'' displays the high sheen and nearly
photorealistic detail that Americans appreciated in illustrations
he produced for Vanity Fair and The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   A work in tempera by Alfredo Ramos Martinez, ``Workers,'' when
viewed from a distance of 10 feet appears to be a colorful but
otherwise ordinary expressionist rendering of women working in a
field. But on closer examination, it delivers a surprise. The work
is painted upon a sheet of newsprint, from the classified-ad
section of the Dec. 10, 1944, edition of the Los Angeles Times. The
fine lines of the newspaper, far from distracting, lend a delicate
texture to the work, a sort of tantalizing hint in its background.
Look more closely; there's a joke here! Curator Hartup says that
Ramos, who moved to Los Angeles to provide medical care for an
ailing daughter, originally painted on newsprint for lack of
materials. But he liked the enhancement that it gave his works, and
he didn't give up the trick even when better times came along.
</P>
<P>
   The most memorable work in ``Indigenismo's'' displays may well
be ``Mxico se transforma en una gran ciudad'' (Mexico City
Transforms Into a Big City), from Alfredo Zalce, a teacher and
muralist born in 1908. The 1947 etching, owned by the University of
Texas at Austin, is one of those that cannot be reproduced in DMA
brochures or in the public press, not only because of copyright
problems but mainly because its sentiment is outrageous: Readers
would howl and consuls would call were it waved like a banner.
</P>
<P>
   The etching shows men in an urban landscape, clad in rags,
rummaging through tow sacks. The men may be burglars, or they may
be bums; it's hard to tell. A malnourished dog prowls in a garbage
can near the center of the image; reclining legs in wrinkled pants,
from which bare feet protrude, lie in the foreground: somebody is
sleeping on the street. The human characters in the image have
simian faces and simian hands. Poverty degrades the poor, the
message seems to say. But ``gran ciudad'' is more than a protest of
homelessness. The multilevel buildings in the picture come only to
shoulder-height on its monkeylike men, and in that detail, the work
says something else, something sardonic: Although modern society
impoverishes us, we dwarf its towering accomplishments. The wit and
style of ``gran ciudad'' are as Mexican as can be _ this is an
indigenismo drawing. But its message is ironically, if lamentably,
quite universal. This nationalist work speaks as clearly to viewers
in contemporary Texas as it did to Zalce's countrymen a
half-century ago.

SECOND COMPLAINT AGAINST STATE SEN. BROWN WILL NOT BE PURSUED,
POLICE SAY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE OLAFSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE JACKSON, Texas _ Police won't pursue an investigation into
a second complaint that state Sen. J.E. ``Buster'' Brown made
unwanted sexual advances on a woman, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The second complaint, made by an Alvin woman, alleged the
senator grabbed her and tried to kiss her as she was leaving his
Lake Jackson office after consulting him about a legal matter, said
Police Chief Paul Hromadka.
</P>
<P>
   Because the alleged incident occurred about six months past the
two-year statute of limitations for misdemeanor assault cases,
police will not look any further into the allegation, Hromadka
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Alvin woman notified Lake Jackson police Monday after
reading news coverage of the first complaint made against Brown by
Tiffany Black, a former employee of the senator's, Hromadka said.
</P>
<P>
   The Alvin woman, interviewed Wednesday night by police, notified
authorities about what happened to her to support the allegations
made by Black, a 20-year-old college student, said Hromadka.
</P>
<P>
   The woman did not want to pursue criminal charges for what she
said happened to her, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police did not interview Brown, 57, about the alleged second
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the ranking Republican in the Texas Senate, did not
return a call for comment.
</P>
<P>
   He apologized Wednesday to Black, a Brazosport College student
who quit her job with the senator on Sept. 2 after she told police
he tried to kiss her and touched her breasts and buttocks at his
Lake Jackson office.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's written apology, in which he acknowledged making
unwanted sexual advances toward Black, stated he will seek ``any
necessary corrective measures, including counseling.``
</P>
<P>
   Lake Jackson is about 55 miles south of downtown Houston. &QL;

`VERS LA FLAMME': CHEKHOV'S PAIRS IN MOTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Chekhov or Dr. Laura? In ``Vers la Flamme,'' the
choreographer Martha Clarke has focused her familiar brand of
imagistic dance theater on sexual encounters and marital
unhappiness.
</P>
<P>
   There is more than that to the five stories by Anton Chekhov
that Ms. Clarke uses as a springboard for her often ingenious,
always beautiful and largely uneven new work at the New Victory
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   What is missing is the subtlety of Chekhov's narrators, their
change of tone within a story. With a couple in various states of
undress in each episode, ``Vers la Flamme'' suggests everyday
fodder for a radio psychologist, not an exploration of human
behavior with a moral and social dimension.
</P>
<P>
   Should one then forget Chekhov and concentrate on Ms. Clarke?
She has been doing this kind of thing since she joined Pilobolus
Dance Theater shortly after it was founded in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Forgetting Chekhov may be the best course. ``Vers la Flamme''
has little depth, with one episode as an exception. But it is never
boring, and its tour de force is Ms. Clarke's use of Scriabin's
piano music, played onstage brilliantly by Christopher O'Riley.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln Center, which is presenting ``Vers la Flamme'' through
Sunday as part of its New Visions series, has billed the piece as
an experimental music collaboration. Yet it was the American Dance
Festival that commissioned the work with Lincoln Center. ``Vers la
Flamme'' had its official premiere at the festival in Durham, N.C.,
in July.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of her generation, Ms. Clarke has extended the
definition of dance. Although she has not had the worldwide impact
of Pina Bausch, she uses movement in an unconventional way that
only professional dancers can execute with the right rhythmic
phrasing.
</P>
<P>
   When the American Dance Festival founded and managed her
independent company Crows Nest 20 years ago, her leading dancer was
Felix Blaska, a French dancer who now returns to give a simply
outstanding and powerful performance.
</P>
<P>
   This is especially true in the second tale, ``Enemies,'' in
which the intensity that Blaska showed originally in Roland Petit's
ballet company translate easily into Ms. Clarke's expressive but
reductive movement vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   She has done better before. In ``The Garden of Villandry,'' a
woman was torn between two men. Who was the husband? Who was the
lover? The hints came in the Pilobolus style of weight shifting in
the partnering.
</P>
<P>
   Here again the women are often held on the men's sides, and what
looks like natural gesture or a walk is incorporated into a finite
phrase of movement. Often, and in nearly every episode, a couple
spins or revolves in a metaphor for passion.
</P>
<P>
   When a woman falls at her lover's feet, one recalls Martha
Graham's retort to a viewer who objected to her unseemly collapse
in a ball gown. Graham replied that the fall was equated with her
character's reaction to a lover across the room.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Ms. Clarke's lovers are usually in a literal clinch rather
than yards apart and her style has lost some richness without
attaining a perfect distillation of emotion.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Enemies'' is the exception. Blaska is the country doctor
grieving with his wife, Paola Styron, over the coffin of their dead
child. George de la Pena is Abogin, the boorish landowner who drags
the doctor from his mourning to attend to a supposedly sick wife.
His spouse (Kate Coyne) in fact runs off with her lover (Alexandre
Proia).
</P>
<P>
   Michael Yeargan's stationary set is a blue room with peeling
paint whose atmosphere changes wonderfully with Stephen
Strawbridge's lighting and the emotionally coded music, mostly
Scriabin preludes and a Rachmaninoff prelude as an epilogue. Not
for nothing was Scriabin interested in color theory and how colors
affected the psyche. O'Riley plays Scriabin's ``Flammes Sombres,''
in this episode, and ``Vers la Flamme'' is the piece played at the
end of the fifth tale.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Enemies'' Ms. Styron spins as hammering is heard offstage.
The small coffin is being prepared. She and Blaska sit hunched in
silhouetted despair. The music rumbles as Abogin charges in,
oblivious to the compressed desperation that Blaska telegraphs in
his tightened body.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Coyne, a British dancer, and Proia, formerly with New York
City Ballet, rush by to signify their affair; she is in knickers.
Compared to the doctor's grief, the affair looks trivial, a gap
that Blaska explains through his fists swinging in hysterical rage
as he gazes toward the ever-present coffin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lady With the Lap Dog,'' the first episode, elicited no
applause at the New Victory (209 W. 42nd St., Manhattan). Jane
Greenwood's period costumes, as elsewhere in the work, are fine,
and Ms. Styron as the lady looks vulnerable enough. De la Pena, as
her lover, has a good moment when his smugness gives way to real
passion, but Ms. Clarke rarely goes beyond illustration.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Darling'' Ms. Clarke adds a risky cartoonish flavor to
a story about a woman who cannot live without a man. Ms. Coyne has
an engaging comic flair and flips nicely over an armchair. Blaska
and Proia succumb as her husbands, and de la Pena, a lover, mounts
her in a no-nonsense way. When Sean Dalal, as a child placed in her
care, goes to bed, we do not hear the cry of alarm he utters at the
end of the Chekhov story.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Grasshopper'' fares better with the Canadian dancer and
choreographer Margie Gillis. She is her stunning self and does what
she usually does in her own work: She bares a breast, lets down her
long hair and simulates a breakdown, here as the wife who prefers
her lover to her worthy husband.
</P>
<P>
   In ``A Nervous Breakdown,'' a student who is disgusted with more
than what Ms. Clarke tells us, suffers a crisis in a bordello. The
whores are pictured as stereotypes. But there is something
extraordinary in the way Ms. Clarke has Proia, the student,
transform his lean tall frame into a cringing boyish body that
scales the walls for escape.

BILL BRADLEY MISSES THE RIM

</P>
<P>
   &UR; BY WILLIAM SALETAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Announcing his candidacy for president, Bill Bradley compared
politics to basketball, recalling his love of discipline, teamwork
and ``the swish of the net.''
</P>
<P>
   Pundits ate up the speech. Paul Gigot called it ``a character
and ethics assault'' on Bill Clinton and Al Gore. Fred Barnes
applauded Bradley for ``slam-dunking'' the case against Gore.
``It's the best speech I've ever heard him give,'' said Margaret
Carlson.
</P>
<P>
   A video replay of the speech, however, shows that the swish was
the sound of a jump shot missing the rim altogether. Bradley
continues to think up new ways of saying nothing while making it
look like something.
</P>
<P>
   LEADERSHIP. A speech can set a direction, define an agenda, and
explain what the candidate has done or would do. Instead of
fulfilling these responsibilities, Bradley simply asserts that he
has fulfilled or will fulfill them. He promises to act on his
``convictions'' but doesn't say what they are.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than explain where America should go, he says he has ``a
strong sense of where America is and where we need to go.'' Rather
than define America's role in the world, he pledges to ``define
more clearly America's role in the world.'' Rather than challenge
his listeners or tell them where he plans to lead them, he says
they deserve ``leadership that respects the people as well as
challenges them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than say what he would do, he promises, ``There are two
kinds of politicians: those who talk and promise, and those who
listen and do. I know which one I am.''
</P>
<P>
   DEPTH. Bradley, like George W. Bush, says prosperity isn't
enough. ``What we need in America is a deeper prosperity ... a
prosperity that makes us feel rich inside as well as out,'' he
argues. ``The leadership that is called for at this moment goes
beyond a presidency and into every home and heart. ... A leadership
that understands the people's fears as well as their hopes.''
</P>
<P>
   By exuding profundity, Bradley shames those who wonder what it
means to ``feel rich inside,'' and why this is more important than
rising incomes and declining unemployment. The problem isn't that
Bradley's message is empty. The problem is that you're too shallow
to understand it.
</P>
<P>
   IMMEASURABILITY. ``The Dow Jones is at record heights,'' Bradley
concedes, but ``such numbers are not the measure of all things.
They do not measure what is in our heads and our hearts. They do
not measure a young girl's smile or a little boy's first handshake
or a grandmother's pride. They convey nothing about friendship or
the self-fulfillment of helping a person in need. They tell us
little about the magic of a good marriage or the satisfaction of a
life led true to its own values.''
</P>
<P>
   These things have nothing to do with the presidency, but never
mind. The point is that they can't be ``measured,'' and therefore,
no one can disprove Bradley's suggestion that they're lacking today
and that his presidency would restore them.
</P>
<P>
   WHOLENESS. Bradley speaks constantly of elusive wholes.
``America should be made whole,'' he says. He proposes to build
``racial unity,'' ``confidence in our collective will,'' and ``a
prosperity that adds up to more than the sum of all our
possessions.'' ``A team is not just about winning,'' he adds.
``It's about shared sacrifice; it's about giving up something small
for yourself in order to gain something large for everyone. It's
the same for our country.''
</P>
<P>
   What is the ``something large''? What does ``unity'' entail?
What does our ``collective will'' call for? Bradley doesn't dwell
on such coarse concerns. The point is wholeness itself.
</P>
<P>
   THINGS. Lest anyone doubt Bradley's substance, he touts his
record of doing ``things.'' In the Senate, he ``reached across
party lines to get things done. I attempted to do big things
without ever losing sight of the little things.`` If elected, he'll
``do some of the big things that need to be done. ... We will do
fewer things, but they will be essential things, and we will do
them more thoroughly.'' And what exactly are these ``large and
essential things''?
</P>
<P>
   Bradley cites only one example: the Works Project
Administration. How he would apply a Depression-era public jobs
program to today's roaring economy remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   REALITY. To those who suspect him of empty idealism, Bradley
asserts a firm grasp of ``reality.'' ``Isn't it just common sense
that we make sure every child in America is covered by health
care?'' he asks. ``Isn't it just common sense that we protect our
natural world from destruction, and do what it takes to achieve
racial unity? Isn't it common sense that all our schools should
perform well, and that more Americans should do better
economically? What others may call idealism is a common sense
reality I know we can achieve.'' How will Bradley realize these
``realities''? He doesn't say. The point is that he will ``do what
it takes.'' Really. It's just common sense.
</P>
<P>
   POSSIBILITY. ``The American Dream,'' Bradley argues, ``is not
just an ideal to wish on. It should be a possibility available to
all. ... The renewal of the American Dream has to shine so bright
that we can dream dreams we never thought possible before. ... I
want that hope, that encouragement, that sense of possibility to be
a reality for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Since possibility can't be measured, no one can disprove
Bradley's claim that the American Dream is impossible for too many
people today, and no one can disprove him if he claims four years
from now that he has made it possible again.
</P>
<P>
   POETRY. Bradley relies heavily on metaphors. Americans should
``be fixing our roof while the sun is shining,'' he says. As
president, he pledges to ``set the table for future economic
growth,'' ``put every American on the train of that deeper, broader
prosperity,'' and ``urge Americans to bridge the divide of
prejudice.'' What any of this means is left to the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Bradley recalls, he learned from his father that
``character is where you find it.'' As a senator, ``I tried to help
people where they lived their lives.'' As president, he will
``invest in our common future.''
</P>
<P>
   So, if you want a president who invests in the past, finds
character where it isn't, and helps people where they don't live,
vote for someone else.
</P>
<P>
   SKEPTICISM. ``Our campaigns often end up doing the very opposite
of what they intend,'' Bradley laments. ``Instead of engendering
hope and optimism, they breed mistrust and cynicism. Just last week
in Iowa, after I spoke about political involvement, once again
making our nation better, a woman came up to me and said, 'It all
sounds so wonderful, if only it could be true.' ... Yes, the
American people have a right to be skeptical. But I have a right to
try to change that skepticism. ... I am trying to run a different
kind of presidential campaign. I'm calling us to renew our faith in
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Skepticism, as Bradley defines it, is about whether a big-money
political system will let his vision come ``true.'' This obscures a
more sophisticated skepticism about whether he has a substantive
vision to begin with, much less a serious plan to achieve it.
Bradley isn't asking us to overcome that skepticism. He's asking us
to overlook it.
</P>
<P>
   And by planting what looks like a bold idea--that the purpose of
campaigning is to ``engender optimism'' and ``renew our faith''--he
erases his obligation to tell us how he would govern. Bradley's
campaign, it turns out, isn't about the presidency. It's about
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   The pundits can't believe Bradley has nothing to say. Some
surmise that he's cleverly waiting to unveil his platform. Others
infer that he's already mounting a brilliantly oblique attack on
Gore. Both camps read insight into his every remark. If you don't
recognize his wisdom, you must not get what the election is about.
</P>
<P>
   Does Bradley get it? Don't be a cynic. Ask not whether your
candidate is worthy of you, but whether you are worthy of your
candidate.

`GET BRUCE!': THE MAN BEHIND THE NAUGHTY CHUCKLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes the oddest events can catalyze a show business career.
As Bruce Vilanch, the writer of hilarious special material for
Bette Midler, Whoopi Goldberg, Billy Crystal, Robin Williams and
dozens of other Hollywood stars, recalls, for him it was ``The
Vamp,'' a glitzy flop Broadway show starring Carol Channing.
</P>
<P>
   Vilanch, who didn't emerge from behind the show business scenes
until he began appearing regularly on ``Hollywood Squares,'' is the
endearing, very funny and utterly unpretentious subject of Andy
Kuehn's likable documentary, ``Get Bruce!'' If anyone can be said
to have reinvented awards-show patter since the days of Bob Hope,
it is Vilanch, who over the last decade has regularly stamped his
gently campy, carefully naughty signature on the Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   But the Oscars are only the tip of the iceberg. Vilanch has also
written for the Emmys, for President Clinton's 50th-birthday party
and for numerous Hollywood galas. As scenes of him collaborating
with Crystal, Williams and others reveal, he is a masterly
technician whose special gift is coming up with material so
custom-fitted to an individual personality that you barely sense
the writer's invisible hand.
</P>
<P>
   Chubby, with an unruly mop of blond hair and a preference for
oversize, pink plastic-rim glasses and wittily inscribed T-shirts
from his extensive collection, Vilanch effuses the good-natured
canniness of an all-knowing cherub. He observes, without a trace of
malice, that one of the prerequisites of becoming a major Hollywood
star is a powerful, driving self-absorption.
</P>
<P>
   Adopted at the age of 4, Vilanch grew up in suburban New Jersey
and recalls discovering early in life that he was gay. He developed
his humor partly to deflect peer-group persecution.
</P>
<P>
   We meet his mother, a longtime show business devotee to whom he
feels related by blood, even though he isn't. While working as a
celebrity interviewer for The Chicago Tribune, he wrote a profile
of Ms. Midler that so impressed her that she called to compliment
him, and the two began collaborating. He introduced her to the
raunchy humor of Sophie Tucker. Eventually moving to the West
Coast, Vilanch had his first Hollywood job writing for ``The Brady
Bunch Variety Hour,'' in which he had the formidable task of making
guests like Donny and Marie Osmond sound semi-hip.
</P>
<P>
   Vilanch's collaborations have occasionally ruffled feathers. The
most notorious case was a Friar's Club roast of Whoopi Goldberg at
which Ted Danson, her boyfriend at the time, appeared in blackface.
Ms. Goldberg defends Vilanch in the film and says he was only doing
what she wanted. Of Ms. Goldberg, he observes: ``You know there's
going to be that moment when she goes off the graph, that's the
whole idea. If you didn't want that to happen, you'd hire Kathie
Lee Gifford.'' We also meet an ABC television censor who frets
about the necessity of having to monitor Ms. Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   Among the high points of Vilanch's career were the inspired
musical-comedy medleys he created with Crystal to introduce the
best picture nominations, from which ``Get Bruce!'' shows excerpts.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Vilanch's services don't come cheap. When Barbra
Streisand called, he says, she made him an offer that was less than
what Jim Bailey had made for him to work on a show in which he
impersonated her. Even so. Ms. Streisand wouldn't budge. It's the
one moment of ``Get Bruce!'' in which Vilanch allows himself to
bite back.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The last time a new medium transformed American politics was
1960. The medium was, of course, television, and the signal event
was the Kennedy-Nixon presidential debate, the first to be
broadcast live to a national audience.
</P>
<P>
   Radio listeners polled afterward gave the victory to Nixon. But
Kennedy won the debate--and arguably the election--because he came
off better on television. Kennedy looked cooler, more confident,
and more handsome. He also knew something Nixon didn't--how to
project himself through the new technology.
</P>
<P>
   In office, JFK took further advantage of the medium, using
television to shape the public perception of his administration.
After press conferences, he would replay his films in private,
critiquing the lighting and camera angles.
</P>
<P>
   It is already a cliche that the 2000 election signals the advent
of another new medium, the Internet. As is often the case with the
Web, predictions of dominance come in two flavors: utopian and
apocalyptic.
</P>
<P>
   Utopians think the Net has the power to undo the damage wrought
upon American politics by television. In their view, it stands to
increase the power of ideas and diminish the importance of
30-second attack ads. It will disenfranchise unelected elites and
give democratic power back to individuals. It will reduce the power
of money.
</P>
<P>
   Gloom-and-doomsters, on the other hand, assert that the Net will
do just the opposite, reducing genuine participation, threatening
personal privacy, and lending itself to new forms of manipulation
by amoral operatives and moneyed interests.
</P>
<P>
   My prediction: This election will be more important to the Net
than the Net will be to the election. Just as 1960 conferred
legitimacy on TV journalism, Campaign 2000 promises to put the Net
on the political map. It's less of a given, though, that the Net
will actually affect the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of the TV analogy, 2000 may be 1956 or 1948 rather than
1960. Television existed in those elections and was spreading
rapidly into millions of homes. But for a variety of reasons, it
wasn't yet a decisive or central factor.
</P>
<P>
   So, how can we know how important the Web is this time around?
Only by casting a skeptical eye on the ambitious claims being made
on its behalf and evaluating them against reality. Slate,
Microsoft's online magazine, and the Industry Standard have joined
forces for a continuing real-time examination of the 2000 campaign
as it happens on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   In this column, we'll follow the topic where it takes us. But to
start out, here are some of the subjects ``Net Election'' is likely
to consider and reconsider over the next 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   NET FUND-RAISING
</P>
<P>
   One way those goofy candidate Web sites can quickly establish
their value is by raising gobs of money. So far, they've helped a
bit. According to its most recent filing with the Federal Election
Commission, Bill Bradley's campaign so far has received $330,000
from its Web site. This is only about 3 percent of what Bradley has
collected overall.
</P>
<P>
   But there are reasons for Bradley and his rivals to like Web
money more than other kinds. One is that the cost of raising money
on the Net is very low compared with sending out direct mail or
throwing a gala. A Web site is basically an electronic collection
plate, which consumes few of a candidate's resources. For this
reason, Net-based political fund-raising is destined to grow--and
probably just as quickly as other forms of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Web fund-raising may also point the way toward campaign finance
reform. George W. Bush recently initiated a practice that will
surely become the norm: declaring contributions immediately online,
instead of waiting for quarterly FEC deadlines. You could do worse
than the system of campaign finance that is evolving on the Web,
where contributions limited to the less-than-influential amount of
$1,000--approximately one-50,000th of what Bush has raised so
far--are immediately disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there remains the problem of many-times-larger
soft-money donations. But thanks to the Web, it's at least easy to
discover which special interests are supporting which candidates.
The best disclosure site, FECInfo, puts at everyone's fingertips
information that used to require trips to the FEC office in
Washington and hours of poring over dim microfiches.
</P>
<P>
   NET ORGANIZING
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage of Web contributions is that they often come
with a promise of volunteer time. The grass roots group MoveOn.org,
which was formed to oppose impeaching President Clinton last year,
quickly gathered pledges of $13 million and 500,000 signatures on a
petition, just by pinging e-mail back and forth. What's more,
30,000 people pledged 750,000 hours of volunteer time to defeat
pro-impeachment legislators in the 2000 election. You can't trust
politician-haters, but if the volunteers live up to their promises,
they stand to become a significant factor in the contest for
control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans targeted for defeat may harness the same techniques
in self-defense. Rudy Giuliani's Senate campaign reports that he
has already signed up 11,000 volunteers on the twin Web sites
RudyYes.com and HillaryNo.com. Those with little inclination to
hand out leaflets at rainy commuter stations at rush hour can
become ``e-volunteers.''
</P>
<P>
   By using the Web in this way, a campaign can convert mass
support into grass roots support. Steve Forbes' Internet guru Rick
Segal tried to work the Iowa straw poll this way. He set up a
national e-mail tree designed to get people to send their friends
in Iowa to Ames as Forbes supporters. How great an effect it had is
hard to say.
</P>
<P>
   NET ADVERTISING
</P>
<P>
   Like Net fund raising, Net advertising isn't destined to replace
the older method (i.e., television) overnight--or ever. But it is
certain to grow as a share of the total.
</P>
<P>
   TV ads are dumb, both in the sense that they tend to be crudely
demagogic appeals, and because they can't target segments of the
electorate with any degree of accuracy. Web advertising is smart,
in the sense that it can be far more detailed and specific and
because it can reach a target with surgical precision.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Al Gore has plans to focus on women-oriented sites.
Steve Forbes intends to advertise on day trading and investment
sites, where people who might vote for him are likely to be found.
One possibility is that these ads will develop into a new form of
micro-pandering, but the process will be interesting no matter
where it leads. Techniques and conventions that will come to seem
eternal and inevitable will actually be invented in the coming
months.
</P>
<P>
   NET ISSUES
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, several congressional candidates campaigned against
Internet pornography--an issue of greater interest to people
off-line than to those online. This time, you're more likely to
hear candidates vowing to protect electronic privacy or block taxes
on e-commerce. One way to gauge how important the Web is in 2000 is
by watching how seriously candidates take the Net's own special
interest issues. What we have yet to see, but can expect fairly
soon, are politicians who fit the computer industry's political
profile.
</P>
<P>
   Internet politics are basically soft libertarian--liberal on
social issues, anti-tax, and anti-regulation (but pro-environment
and pro-gun control). The tech industry's dream candidate would
combine Bill Bradley's views on abortion, gay rights, and guns with
Steve Forbes' dedication to lower capital gains taxes. That person
doesn't seem to be running in this campaign, but he or she may
emerge in the course of it (possibly occupying the body of a
current candidate expressing somewhat different views).
</P>
<P>
   NET COVERAGE
</P>
<P>
   The campaign news cycle has grown shorter with each successive
election. Thanks to the Web, it may be entirely repealed in 2000.
These days, everyone has a Web site and a big established news
organization can drop an election-transforming scoop into the mix
at any hour of the day or night, just as Matt Drudge can.
</P>
<P>
   And candidates won't have much luck with a traditional stratagem
such as semi-suppressing a story by not responding until after the
evening news deadlines. Rapid response will become more rapid than
ever, with several volleys being fired in the course of what used
to be a campaign day.
</P>
<P>
   There's lots more that we intend to chew over here: Web voting,
Net gossip, and cybersquatting. Perhaps the most interesting
question will be the extent to which the 2000 campaign will happen
in cyberspace as well as in meat space. One role model may be
Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, who integrated the real and the
virtual to an impressive degree in his Web-savvy 1998 campaign.
Ventura organized his original effort by e-mail, tracked his bus
tour with digital pictures, and encouraged a lively bulletin board
discussion of it. To a considerable degree, his Web site was where
his campaign actually happened.
</P>
<P>
   As bandwidth increases, more candidates will be able to bypass
the press by producing C-SPAN-style coverage of their own races.
Whether anyone will be watching is yet another question.

   `Gulliver' Travels to DVD Format
</P>
<P>
   This week DVD got its second megatitle, ``The Matrix,'' to go
with its first, ``Titanic,'' released in August. Distributors say
about one million copies of each are headed for the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, with two million DVD players in use, that divides
into one ``Titanic'' and one ``Matrix'' for every two machines, a
sales rate no DVD booster could logically complain about.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year the number of DVD machines is expected to
be four million. That cuts the disk-to-player ratio, but by that
time there will be several animated titles from Disney that should
sell at least a million copies each and probably more.
</P>
<P>
   What does this say about DVD? ``Good steady movement,'' said
Dick Kelly, president of Cambridge Associates, a consulting company
that monitors the format. DVD, he said, has gone beyond early
adopters and is approaching, in the lingo of the marketers, ``early
mass.'' That's not to say a rush, however. At the moment DVD seems
to be settling in as a kind of sidekick to the VCR, whose sales are
as high as ever.
</P>
<P>
   The disk also continues to move beyond action films like ``The
Matrix.'' DVD is a special pleasure with restorations like
``Gulliver's Travels,'' Max Fleischer's 1939 animated film, which
is to be released on disk and videocassette on Tuesday by Winstar.
Colors are the way they were in the '30s, and multiple tracks offer
a choice of the original soundtrack, stereo, surround sound and
(the ultimate) Dolby Digital surround sound.
</P>
<P>
   Released originally by Paramount, ``Gulliver's Travels,'' is no
classic, but it has an interesting history. Fleischer's adaptation
of Jonathan Swift's tale of the gentle giant washed onto the shores
of the tiny Lilliputians followed Disney's ``Snow White'' by two
years.
</P>
<P>
   At several junctures in the film a few of the small folk bear
more than a passing resemblance to the seven dwarfs, and while
making new clothing for Lemuel Gulliver, the little craftsmen all
but whistle while they work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paramount wanted competition with what Disney had done, so
Fleischer was under direct orders to make it similar,'' said Tom
Reich, an animation expert who produced and directed the
restoration for Audio Galaxy, a production company based in the
Universal Studios Complex in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Fleischer _ better known as the creator of Betty Boop
and the man who first brought Popeye to the screen _ got
bushwhacked. ``At the time Fleischer was the larger of the two
studios,'' Reich said. Since 1936 he had made 20-minute films that
were billed as opening features in theaters. ``Then Disney
surprised everybody with a full-length feature,'' he said.
Originally planned for 20 minutes, ``Gulliver's Travels'' ballooned
to 110 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lot of work. More than 700 artists produced almost
640,000 frames. The film did very well in theaters. Fleischer later
moved on to industrial films and television. Everyone knows what
happened to Disney.
</P>
<P>
   God Said ``Ha!''
</P>
<P>
   In her monologue the actress Julia Sweeney recalls that during
her hysterectomy the doctors lost track of one of her ovaries.
``Don't worry, it's going to turn up eventually,'' she was told. By
that point in her life Ms. Sweeney had honed a fine humor about
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   A ``divorce made in heaven'' is followed by news that her
incurably ill brother and her parents are coming over to her place
_ permanently. ``What happens when your brother gets cancer and
your entire family moves in with you?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sweeney remembers asking in the self-help section of a
bookstore. ``Where is that book?'' As her crises deepen, Janet
Maslin wrote in The New York Times, her film stays ``quick-witted
and funny without betraying the sadness of the events described.''
</P>
<P>
   1999. Miramax. $104.16. 85 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13.
</P>
<P>
   My Favorite Martian
</P>
<P>
   A three-eyed, three-stomached Martian hops in the trunk of an
unwitting television newsman named Tim O'Hara (Jeff Daniels).
</P>
<P>
   Back at Tim's place the extraterrestrial becomes Uncle Martin
(Christopher Lloyd), an urbane if excitable fellow in constant fear
of being discovered. And he has reason, it turns out, as the
government closes in on the visitor, who tends to literally fall
apart physically when he gets depressed.
</P>
<P>
   In an adaptation of the '60s sitcom, Daniels and Lloyd play off
each other nicely to make ``an amiable family entertainment''
(Lawrence Van Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   1999. Disney. $22.99. 100 minutes. Closed captioned. PG. Release
date: Sept. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Children of Heaven
</P>
<P>
   Two Iranian children, Ali (Mir Farrokh Hashemian) and his
sister, Zahra (Bahareh Seddiqui), share the same pair of sneakers
because she has lost hers and they don't want their parents to find
out. From then on every detail of impoverished life in Tehran is
detailed down to the careful unraveling of a woolen garment so it
can be knitted into some thing else.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, though, life is sweet and the feeling manipulative in
Majid Majidi's film, in which ``no reality beyond the economic
intrudes upon a fairy-tale atmosphere'' (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   1999. Miramax. $104.16. 88 minutes. Farsi with English
subtitles. No rating.
</P>
<P>
   Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a
theater release, appeared on television or been on videocassette in
earlier editions.
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN PLAYHOUSE. The acclaimed PBS series adapted from the
works of American writers (and some foreigners) comes to home video
for the first time with six productions: Mary Austin's ``Land of
Little Rain,'' with Helen Hunt, 65 minutes; Kurt Vonnegut Jr.'s

Christian values were often invoked--but only those concerning sex.
</P>
<P>
   What no one talked about was that from the Middle Ages through
the Reformation era, Christian moral theology, both Catholic and
Protestant, has upheld other principles relevant to Flytrap: above
all, that ``nemo tenetur detegere turpitudinem suam,'' or ``no one
is compelled to reveal his own secret sin.''
</P>
<P>
   A corollary holds that no one--including judges and
prosecutors--has a moral right to compel another person to disclose
his private shameful acts.
</P>
<P>
   As the eminent Puritan theologian William Ames wrote in
``Conscience and the Cases Thereof,'' He whose offense is hidden
has the right ``to preserve his fame that it should not rashly be
laid open. Neither is it the part of a judge to search into hidden
faults.''
</P>
<P>
   You may not agree with this principle, but it was the church's
position for centuries. According to medieval canon law, ``private
and shameful acts,'' the sorts of things a penitent whispers to his
priest, lie outside the jurisdiction of public tribunals.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, both Catholic and Protestant writers argued against
compelling people to answer specific incriminating questions under
oath--because, Ames explains, it is ``against nature'' to expect
``that any man should betray or defame himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Even this stiff old Puritan never supposes that it is only weak,
unprincipled men who lie under such circumstances. To put someone
on oath, and then ask if he has masturbated or committed adultery
(both mortal sins according to traditional Christian ethics), is
merely to ``give occasion of horrid perjuries.'' The Roman Catholic
jurist Julius Clarus says much the same, adding ``as daily
experience teaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditional Christian morality even supports President Clinton's
slippery answers to prosecutors' questions. It was precisely to
give witnesses and defendants a way out of the perjury trap that
theologians distinguished between a lie and a misleading or
equivocal statement.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Mason, an Anglican priest writing in the early 17th
century, points out that in traditional Protestant and Catholic
ethics ``if there be just cause for concealing of a truth,'' one
may use words in a ``less known and common signification, and in
another meaning than it is likely the hearers will understand
them.'' Like, say, using ``sex'' in a sense that excludes fellatio
(though that's not an example that Mason gives).
</P>
<P>
   Traditional Christian moral theology does not view attempts to
hide one's private sins and shame as grave offenses. What it does
view as a fundamental violation of Christian charity is detractio:
disclosing another human being's private failings and weaknesses in
order to ruin his good name or otherwise bring him into discredit.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Summa Theologica of Thomas Aquinas, to harm
someone this way is a mortal sin--even if the allegations are
true--since ``defamation is not a distortion of the truth but the
destruction of a reputation.'' Or, as Ames puts it, he is ``truly a
detractor who revealeth a true sin of another man's ... spoiling
the man's reputation to the intent to hurt him.''
</P>
<P>
   Aquinas considered detractio more seriously wicked than theft,
because ``reputation is more valuable than riches.'' Citing St.
Augustine, some penitential manuals classify it as a type of
homicide, while others make it a sin against the Holy Spirit and
thus unforgivable.
</P>
<P>
   The Protestant Ames takes an equally hard line: ``The unjust
revealing a secret hath in it oftentimes the pernicious violations
of trust, friendship, and honesty,'' and is therefore ``not only in
the common esteem of men, but in the Scripture also, reckoned
amongst the most odious sins.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are times when one has a moral right and duty
to reveal damaging information about another person. As Ames notes,
``every citizen'' is bound to notify the authorities of ``faults
which do either immediately hurt the public good ... or which hurt
heavily any innocent.'' But, he adds, as long as ``the fault itself
is not pernicious to others ... then charity and justice require
that, setting aside accusation, we content ourselves with private
correction.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the release of the Starr report a year ago was,
by traditional Christian standards, the big sin of Flytrap.
Disclosing every last humiliating detail of Clinton's sex life
occupies the dead center of what traditional Christianity means by
sin--and is perhaps even more deeply wrong than either committing
or concealing adultery.
</P>
<P>
   If, as many said, Flytrap reflects the erosion of traditional
Christian values, it is not because a man committed adultery and
lied about it--which is nothing new. The evidence of eroding
Christian values is that compelling a man to publicize his hidden
faults and punishing him for not cooperating in his own disgrace
are no longer considered by many to be sins at all.

 &HT;    It's no mystery why sleuth genre has grown
 &HT;    By Stephanie Allmon
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Here's a clue as to ``whodunnit'' in the book
business lately: With more than 1,500 titles published and more
than 60 million sold in 1998, mysteries are the most popular form
of fiction in the country.
</P>
<P>
   And some in the industry estimate about one in every five or six
novels published is a mystery book.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Mysteries) seemed to have taken off recently,'' said Toni
Boughton, department manager for Barnes and Noble Booksellers in
Waco. ``We've seen its popularity rise from a thin dime paperback
genre, and now more are published in hardback, more are on
best-seller lists and more are in movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Capitalizing on the trend, the Friends of the Waco-McLennan
County Library are bringing mystery author Tony Hillerman to the
Texas Ranger Hall of Fame &AMP; Museum tonight for a lecture and
reception.
</P>
<P>
   People have always liked figuring out mysteries, said Mary
Katherine Marion, Southwest regional chapter president of Mystery
Writers of America. Marion, who lives in Houston and has written
mystery plays for 13 years, says audiences like to become
detectives while they engage in a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love a challenge. They love to think that they can
figure out the mystery before anyone else,'' she said. ``It's a
competitive thing. They like the challenge of a mystery and the
excitement of it.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the characteristics of a good mystery are elementary.
</P>
<P>
   It starts with an intriguing plot centered on a murder, larceny,
treachery, blackmail, sex or violence, ``in order to make sure that
it's exciting.'' Add deception and motive ``so you think everybody
did it,'' and play it out with interesting characters whom everyone
loves or hates, she said.
</P>
<P>
   And there it is: The genre that has changed relatively little in
150 years.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Allan Poe published the first mystery story, ``The Murders
in the Rue Morge,'' in 1841, and Sherlock Holmes, Nancy Drew and
the Hardy Boys embarked on mysterious adventures in the next 100
years. But until recently, the target audience has been primarily
middle-aged women, Marion said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the popularity of ``themed'' mysteries, such as
Hillerman's American Indian mysteries, readers in all demographics
are reaching for their metaphorical magnifying glasses and turning
the pages as imaginary sleuths.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to mystery, there really is something for everyone
_ from mysteries about animals to foreign cultures, Boughton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is a mystery,'' she said. ``It's very accommodating
to a wide variety of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Duncan, reference librarian for the Waco-McLennan County
Library, said the library tries to keep a good variety of mystery
fiction. Variety means enough ``pretty mysteries'' and ``tough guy
mysteries,'' as well as newly emerging types like Christian
mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike other genres, he said, mystery fans get hooked on one
particular author and read as many books as possible, especially if
that author has written a series. A popular one now is Lilian
Jackson Braun's ``Cat Who'' series about feline detectives.
</P>
<P>
   And for those high-tech sleuths, there's even an online mystery
network _ MysteryNet.com _ full of interactive mysteries that
audiences can solve in front of a computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the place for everyone who likes mystery,'' said Steve
Schaffer, founder and CEO of MysteryNet.com.
</P>
<P>
   Mystery fans can register for e-mailed mystery miniseries, they
can vote on solutions to mysteries, learn about the history of the
genre, buy mystery books and play mystery games online.
</P>
<P>
   MysteryNet.com, created by Newfront Productions of San
Francisco, debuted in 1995 as a special interest site primarily
focused toward women.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than half a million people receive TheCase.com's
weekly online miniseries via e-mail. According to Schaffer, about
300,000 new visitors access the site each month.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about it, mysteries are interactive,'' Schaffer
said. ``Whether they are trying to second guess a character or
solve mysteries, it's the best genre to do interactively.''
</P>
<P>
   This new media market has changed the mystery genre for the
better, Marion said, because the Internet is able to reach a broad
base of people, especially younger audiences.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of younger audiences, NancyDrew.com even offers
teachers lesson plans to incorporate organization and
classification skills into reading, vocabulary and creative writing
classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mysteries are a great way to teach critical thinking,''
Schaffer said.
</P>
<P>
   He said hundreds of teachers are using the lesson plans in their
classes.
</P>
<P>
   MysteryNet has acquired the rights for the official Agatha
Christie Web site, and soon will launch interactive features on her
works.
</P>
<P>
   But a person need not click a mouse or even set foot in a
bookstore to enjoy what mysteries are all about, Marion said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the Bible is a mystery,'' Marion said. ``God created life
to be a mystery so we could all try to figure it out. It's that
inner challenge that everybody loves about it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. _ ``The City Different,'' they like to call it,
and that it is, a heady blend of Hispanic, Native American and
Anglo cultures, with a brisk topping up, these last few decades, of
new money, big money, from Texas, California and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Perched 7,000 feet above sea level on an alluringly undulating
plateau, dry but not arid, Santa Fe is a leafy faux-adobe city
built around a core of old adobe buildings _ some of them very old,
like the Palace of the Governors, the oldest governmental structure
in the United States, which over four centuries has flown Spanish,
Mexican and American flags.
</P>
<P>
   With only 67,000 people, the city has a cultural life worthy of
a European metropolis. The new Georgia O'Keeffe Museum, the
expanded, endlessly enthralling Museum of International Folk Art
and a cluster of new arts institutions housed in vivid buildings by
the Mexican master Ricardo Legorreta have breathed fresh life into
a venerable artistic heritage. So has SITE Santa Fe, with concerts,
literary readings, major one- and two-man shows and huge,
far-ranging biennials, all in a converted beer warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Each summer, the superbly inventive 43-year-old Santa Fe Opera,
playing in a brilliant new theater by James Stewart Polshek on a
hilltop north of town, draws visitors from all around the globe.
The annual Chamber Music Festival and extensive dance and theater
programs also help to make Santa Fe feel, in July and August, a bit
like Salzburg with margaritas. There is sorcery in the air here.
The city, Willa Cather wrote, lies ``at the base of wrinkled green
mountains with bare tops, wave-like mountains, resembling billows
beaten up from a flat sea by a heavy gale.'' Ancestral home of
Pueblo peoples with ancient traditions, the Santa Fe region has
been a magnet for strangers as long as man can remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about everyone comes to Santa Fe, sooner or later,'' said
Sam Ballen, the owner of La Fonda, the city's landmark hotel.
``Some of them are smart enough to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish founded La Villa Real de la Santa Fe de San
Francisco de Asis, the Royal City of the Holy Faith of St. Francis
of Assisi, early in the 17th century, about the same time the
English founded Jamestown. In the 18th century, conquistadors,
clerics and commoners followed El Camino Real, the Royal Road,
north from Mexico City. Early in the 19th, the wagon trains rolled
into town from Missouri along the Santa Fe Trail, and late in the
19th, the iron horse took over, with settlers arriving on trains of
the Atchison, Topeka &AMP; Santa Fe Railway.
</P>
<P>
   Artists fell in love with the magical Sangre de Cristo
Mountains, whose colors change with the passing hours and seasons,
and the intense, crystalline light that defines them so sharply at
dusk. Tourists fell in love with the artists, with tacos and
enchiladas, with the chunky turquoise-studded jewelry made by the
Indians and with the whole ``Santa Fe style'' _ relaxed yet
sophisticated, a mix of Chimayo rugs, distressed pine furniture and
tin-framed mirrors. Soon you could see it in million-dollar houses
in Greenwich and Winnetka and taste it in restaurants everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Coping With Growth
</P>
<P>
   Today, though, the soft-edged romance of Santa Fe is confronted
with a harsher reality. Downtown is choked with cars, with Land
Rovers and jalopies equally immobilized at rush hour. During
daylight hours in summer, the central Plaza belongs to the
tourists. Cerrillos Road is as nasty an urban eyesore, pocked with
motels and burger joints, as any in America.
</P>
<P>
   The preservationists have taken to the trenches, battling the
developers, and they have slowed if not halted the march of
``progress.'' Santa Fe has only a tiny airport. That and the
shortage of water should help to keep it from turning into another
Phoenix, but some of the local grandees are already muttering about
the Aspenization of their beloved city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly we're getting people who think they ought to build
hangars for their jets at the airport,'' said an old-line resident
who would like to pull up the drawbridge.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Santa Fe's past survives. ``The fragrance of pinon fills the
air. Santa Fe is a town of patios where hollyhocks nod, where
towering cottonwoods spatter with shade. Spain is stamped upon the
town. The old man who takes his siesta on a bench in the Plaza may
count among his ancestors a Spanish don who owned a rancho as big
as Delaware. Families still bear names like Delgado, Otero, Ortiz
and Sena.'' Those lines, from the Depression-era W.P.A. Guide to
New Mexico, are not so badly out of date 60 years on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every place grows,'' said Elizabeth Martin, a public-relations
woman who came here from Dallas. ``This place is growing better
than most. We don't have high-rises, and I don't think we will.
Scale is attended to. People think it's chic to live on a dirt
road. And even the developers can't take away the clouds in the
sky, the rainbows and the stars at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Road of Galleries
</P>
<P>
   The epitome of Santa Fe excess, I guess, is Canyon Road, two and
a half miles jampacked with galleries interspersed with cafes and
restaurants. Once artists lived there; now art fights for its place
with schlock and souvenirs. A lot of the stuff for sale, said the
cartoonist Patrick Oliphant, who spends summers here, ``isn't much
better than Elvis on velvet.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of it is. The Gerald Peters Gallery, near the head of
the road, sells works by Albert Bierstadt, O'Keeffe, George Rickey
and much lesser artists. Equally heterogeneous are the wares of the
nearby Nedra Matteucci Galleries, which handle California
regionalists and the early Taos painters. The Morning Star Gallery
sells exquisite old Indian carvings, baskets, pots and jewelry from
many tribes. Downtown, the Andrew Smith Gallery sells photographs
by Edward S. Curtis, Ansel Adams and other wizards of the gelatin
print.
</P>
<P>
   Since Santa Fe is one of the nation's largest art markets, I
asked Susan Conway, Oliphant's wife, who runs an admired gallery in
Washington, which of the smaller dealers she recommended here. She
mentioned Riva Yarres, Lew Allen, Munson and Allene Lapides for
contemporary paintings, as well as the Conlon Siegal galleries on
Gypsy Alley and Canyon Road.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked away in the same part of the city, behind high walls and
beneath mature aspens, apple trees and Ponderosa pines, are the
handsome adobe houses of some of Santa Fe's elite. Ms. Matteucci
and her husband, Richard, a wine wholesaler and accomplished
amateur cook, own one of them, built in the 1880s, with a tiled
plaque signed by Diego Rivera in the garden.
</P>
<P>
   Another gem, designed in the 1920s by John Gaw Meem, the leading
architect of the Adobe Revival here, belongs to Roddey Burdine, a
displaced Miamian, who has filled it with superb Native American
and Hispanic pieces. In an earlier life, the house was the site of
Greer Garson's marriage to Buddy Fogelson, an oil operator; the two
refugees from Hollywood lived here for many years and endowed
several buildings at the College of Santa Fe. Feast for
Museumgoers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For my wife, Betsey, and me, the greatest attraction of the
local art scene, the place we always head for first, is the Museum
of International Folk Art. It is southeast of town, well outside
the center, along with two museums devoted to Indian art. A museum
of Spanish Colonial art is planned for a nearby site, to house a
rich collection, now in storage, of furniture, paintings and the
hand-carved images of saints called santos.
</P>
<P>
   Embracing more than 125,000 objects, the folk art museum's
collection started with toys but now includes doll houses,
textiles, model trains, masks and pottery from Hungary, India,
Senegal, Guatemala, China _ everywhere that craftsmen without
formal tutelage have made objects to entertain, to teach, to
portray or to pay tribute. Which is to say almost everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The collection of Alexander Girard, the great architect and
designer who created the fondly remembered Fonda del Sol restaurant
in Manhattan, forms the museum's backbone, filling a huge gallery.
Girard shared with his friend Alexander Calder a childlike love of
fun, and for me the antic spirit of Sandro and Sandy is ever
present as I wander through that room.
</P>
<P>
   Displayed there and elsewhere in the museum are bits and pieces
that will stir the visual memory of anyone who has done much
traveling: iron gondola prows from Venice, nesting dolls from
Russia, a Thai spirit house displayed next to a Syrian glass
painting of a verse from the Koran, a model 19th-century American
town, embroidery samplers, a market scene populated with colorful
clay figures from Latin America and the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   A new wing, built to house a 1995 gift from Neutrogena and its
former chief executive, Lloyd Cotsen, opened last year. At its
entrance the visitor is greeted by a plastic ``lagoon'' full of
carved wooden crocodiles and alligators from four continents; one
of the displays that follow juxtaposes Uzbek robes and a Winnebago
tote bag, all in primary colors.
</P>
<P>
   Next door, the Museum of Indian Arts and Culture has an enormous
display of pottery, including the black-on-black ware of Maria
Martinez of the San Ildefonso Pueblo, deeply carved vessels by
Margaret Tafoya of the Santa Clara Pueblo and charming little
pottery figurines from Cochiti.
</P>
<P>
   Those and other works are shown within well-explained
historical, geographic and anthropological contexts, rather than
solely as esthetic objects. Poetry punctuates the displays, like
these words by Luci Tapahonso, a Navajo writer: ``We wear the shiny
silver of clear water, we wear turquoise made of bright skies.''
</P>
<P>
   Downtown, the Museum of Fine Arts, housed in a fine Adobe
Revival building (1917) by the pioneers of the style, Rapp &AMP; Rapp
of Denver, mixes works by famous visitors (like Robert Henri and
Marsden Hartley) with those by artists who came to stay (like Buck
Denton and Gustave Baumann).
</P>
<P>
   An etching by John Sloan showing a bunch of blase, short-skirted
women watching an Indian dance captures the mutual misunderstanding
that often characterizes relations among Santa Fe's various
communities and the tourists, even today. Sloan captioned the
piece, ``Knees and Aborigines.''
</P>
<P>
   One more museum, before we move along: the one devoted to
O'Keeffe, also downtown, in a building renovated by Richard
Gluckman of New York, who did the same thing for the Warhol Museum
in Pittsburgh. It owns about an eighth of the 800-plus canvases the
painter produced in a lifetime of work in New York, Maine and her
last home, at Abiquiu in northern New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In its first two years, the museum has attracted 600,000
visitors. O'Keeffe's near-abstract work appeals to many for whom
most ``modern'' art is puzzling or repugnant. The current
exhibition, which includes loans as well as items from the
permanent collection, seeks to dig deeper in cleverly assembled
thematic groups: apples, clams, leaves and a whole room of flowers.
It closes Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been over-iconicized,'' said Barbara Buhler Lynes, the
curator, who took us around. ``Postage stamps, posters, postcards _
but she's more than that. Our job is to to show her in
art-historical context.''
</P>
<P>
   Settings for Culture
</P>
<P>
   The O'Keeffe owes its existence to the new Maecenases of the
visual arts in Santa Fe, John Marion, the retired chairman of
Sotheby's, and his wife, Anne, a Texas heiress. They are also the
prime movers behind a pair of institutions on the College of Santa
Fe campus, the Visual Arts Center and the Santa Fe Art Institute,
which offers intensive study with globally known visiting artists
like Wayne Thiebaud and Donald Sultan.
</P>
<P>
   Legorreta, Mexico's most esteemed architect, has created for the
two wholly separate institutions a series of arresting buildings
that are reminiscent of I.M. Pei (in the acute angles formed by
some walls), Frank Lloyd Wright (in the use of vertical strip
windows to control the southwestern sun) and English oast houses
(in the skylight towers).
</P>
<P>
   But the sum is entirely his own, especially the use of
courtyards and cutouts to provide interior vistas and the
super-saturated colors. The unadorned stucco exteriors are painted
an iron red; the courtyards are Frida Kahlo blue, Pepto-Bismol
pink, clematis purple and daffodil yellow, the last providing a
vibrant contrast with the rich blue sky overhead.
</P>
<P>
   The new opera house by Polshek, who has just been chosen to
design President Clinton's library, is every bit as bold and
dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Its distinguishing characteristic is an elegant, sweeping curve
of a roof, not unlike the one Eero Saarinen designed for Dulles
International Airport near Washington. Supported by cable stays
hung from masts and lined with wood battens, it has two functions:
to protect spectators from the summer cloudbursts that used to
drench them, and to reflect the sound.
</P>
<P>
   As in the one it replaced, the sides of the new theater are
open. So the stars, the moon, the evening breezes and the purple
mountains' majesty (as well as the occasional moth fluttering over
the stage) are all part of the experience. This year an electronic
libretto system was added, similar to the one at the Metropolitan
Opera in New York, with illuminated text strips on the back of each
seat.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Fe Opera is the long shadow of a single man, John
Crosby, who conceived it, worked and willed it into existence and
has served as its only general director and busiest conductor. He
will step down as general director after next season, having
presented 9 world and 28 American premieres, among them Alban
Berg's ``Lulu,'' with casts including James Morris, Bryn Terfel,
Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, Dawn Upshaw and Elizabeth Soderstrom.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This season demonstrated Santa Fe's range, from a crisp
``Idomeneo'' directed by John Copley and starring Jerry Hadley, to
a moving ``Dialogue of the Carmelites,'' staged by Francesca
Zambello, to an irresistibly sudsy ``Countess Maritza,'' which made
Emmerich Kalman seem almost young again.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Zeckendorf, wife of the real estate magnate William
Zeckendorf, raised much of the money for the new opera house. Now
she is working on a project to turn a Spanish Revival movie palace,
the Lensic, into a showcase for music, dance and theater. It will
house the Santa Fe Stages dance and drama productions, other plays
and the Chamber Music Festival, which this year presented Pinchas
Zukerman and Ralph Kirschbaum, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby Attractions
</P>
<P>
   A lot lies within easy day-trip range of Santa Fe, notably the
old artists' village of Taos. It has been overrun by tourists and
aging hippies, and boutiquity has all but eclipsed antiquity. But
the Millicent Rogers Museum, which shows a Standard Oil heiress'
collection of prime Indian art objects, including the most
spectacular turquoise jewelry I've ever seen, is worth a visit. So
are the ancient Taos Pueblo, whose powerful cube-upon-cube
structure retains its impact even amid the dust and debris of
throngs of visitors, and the world-famous little church at Ranchos
de Taos.
</P>
<P>
   Photographed by Adams and Paul Strand and a million tourists'
Nikons, painted by almost everyone, the church's west end,
supported by massive adobe buttresses, is a masterpiece of
vernacular architecture. ``One almost shakes in its presence,''
wrote the art historian G.E. Kidder Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Much is written about the High Road to Taos, and it is worth
every word, a lovely passage from plateau to high meadow. But the
less-celebrated lower road, Route 68, is equally captivating,
following the Rio Grande River as it cuts a gorge through the
mountains on its journey from Colorado to Texas and the Gulf of
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Another good outing takes in Los Alamos, birthplace of the
Atomic Age, and the Bandelier National Monument, evocative of a
more peaceful day.
</P>
<P>
   At Los Alamos, the Bradbury Science Museum tells the story of
the race in the early 1940s to develop an atomic bomb before the
Germans, through an excellent movie and several gripping exhibits:
the original letter from Albert Einstein to ``F.D. Roosevelt,
President of the United States,'' warning that the construction of
``extremely powerful bombs of a new type'' would soon be possible,
and casings of bombs like ``Little Boy,'' dropped on Hiroshima on
Aug. 6, 1945, and ``Fat Man,'' dropped on Nagasaki three days
later.
</P>
<P>
   Each killed 70,000 people; both would fit inside the living room
of the average American house.
</P>
<P>
   Bandelier _ more specifically, Frijoles Canyon, which lies
within it _ was home to the prehistoric Anasazi people, who lived
in caves carved from the canyon's tawny tufa walls and in villages
on its floor. Paved paths lead past ruined ceremonial kivas and up
to the caves, through juniper groves and past numberless tufts of
blue-green chamisa and yellow wildflowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many chic things in Santa Fe now,'' said my
friend Patricia Perini, who comes here often. ``People need to go
out to Bandelier, listen to the birdsong and remind themselves that
the magic of the place was there long before us.''

</P>
<P>
   A STAY IN SANTA FE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Santa Fe is about 2,000 miles from New York City. Here is a
sampling of attractions, along with travel information.
</P>
<P>
   Where to Stay
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BISHOP'S LODGE, &LR;  Bishop's Lodge Road, (505) 983-6377, was once
the private retreat of Bishop Lamy, who helped to build
19th-century Santa Fe. Five minutes from downtown by car, yet a
world apart, this family-run resort is surrounded by hundreds of
acres of forest, threaded with riding trails. Fine old Southwestern
furnishings, tennis courts, a beautiful swimming pool and a
bountiful Sunday brunch complete a very appealing package. Double
room rates: $265, Sundays through Thursdays; Fridays and Saturdays,
$295.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ELDORADO HOTEL, &LR;  309 W. San Francisco St., (505) 988-4455. The
city's biggest hotel, with 201 rooms and nearby villas, it often
has space in high season when others are sold out. On a recent
visit, the front of the house was a zoo: driveway clogged, bellmen
swamped, rooms not ready at 4 p.m. But the rooms are stylishly
fitted out with regional art and furniture, and the best have
terraces, fireplaces and soothing mountain views. Double room
rates: $229.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INN OF THE ANASAZI, &LR;  113 Washington Ave., (505) 988-3030. The
upside of this lovely place is a superb location, just off the
Plaza. The downside is smallish if charming rooms with beamed
ceilings but no views. A library stocked with titles on the
Southwest is a bonus. The restaurant is a bone of contention; some
guidebooks call it the city's best, but in company with others, I
find the food too sweet and often needlessly elaborate. Double room
rates: $259 to $289.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LA POSADA DE SANTA FE, &LR;  330 E. Palace Ave., (505) 986-0000.
After extensive renovation, this deluxe resort reopened this summer
with 40 new rooms added to the original 119, but early days
produced teething problems. Spanish Colonial artifacts grace the
lobby. Adobe buildings, shaded by lofty pines, are scattered around
six acres, along with a spa and a swimming pool. The Plaza is close
by. Double room rates: $199 to $389.
</P>
<P>
   Where to Eat
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAFE PASQUAL'S, &LR;  121 Don Gaspar Ave., (505) 983-9340. Santa Fe
foodies swear by this festive little spot, with the motto ``Panza
llena, corazon contento'' (``Full stomach, contented heart'').
Katharine Kagel's cooking is ambitious, eclectic and mostly
successful: crunchy vegetable fritters called ghia pakora, squash
blossoms stuffed with goat cheese, pomegranate-glazed rack of lamb,
salmon grilled in a banana leaf and served with sticky coconut
rice. Chili ristras dangle atmospherically overhead.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAFE SAN ESTEVAN, &LR;  428 Agua Fria, (505) 995-1996. I owe this
discovery to Margo True, a former editor of mine with a discerning
palate. Estevan Garcia, a onetime monk, worked with John Sedlar, a
pioneer of New Southwestern cooking in Los Angeles; here he returns
to his roots. In a single plain room in an old house, he serves
definitive New Mexican food: a subtly spiced cake of guacamole and
corn kernels, old-time tamales stuffed with shredded pork, and the
city's best enchiladas, with red Chimayo chili sauce.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COYOTE CAFE, &LR;  132 W. Water St., (505) 983-1615. It is chic in
some circles to knock Mark Miller, and I don't much care for his
Washington venture, Red Sage, but this is an altogether more
serious matter. Bravo for his unbeatable trademark dish, Cowboy
Steak (a bone-in ribeye), which is aged for three weeks, and the
dead-fresh peaches and blueberries over yogurt sorbet, my dessert
of the summer. The service is warm and knowledgeable, and no fewer
than 53 tequilas complement the town's best wine list.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GERONIMO, &LR;  724 Canyon Road, (505) 982-1500. The local art crowd
passes in review here, drawn by stylish modern cooking. You won't
go wrong with the pork tenderloin tacos with an avocado and
habanero cream sauce, or the juicy mesquite-grilled buffalo burger
topped with grilled red onions, provolone cheese, red bell peppers
and ancho mayonnaise. And the tequila lime tart is a bellringer. Go
early at lunch to snare a table on the porch.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HARRY'S ROADHOUSE, &LR;  Old Las Vegas Highway, (505) 989-4629.
Santa Fe loves breakfast, and Harry's, set in the lee of the Jemez
Mountains southeast of town, serves one of the best. Waffles,
frittatas and puffy french toast are all delicious, but the house
triumph is migos, a chili-laced trencherman's scramble of eggs,
crisp tortilla strips, tomatoes and chorizo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EL PARAGUA, &LR;  603 Santa Cruz Road, Espanola, (505) 753-3211.
Beamed, cavelike, El Paragua has been as steady as the moon and
stars for decades. It makes an ideal lunch stop on excursions to
Taos or Los Alamos, notable for its carnitas _ chewy
mesquite-grilled sirloin tips _ and sopaipillas, feather-light
pillows of golden dough with homemade peach preserves.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RISTRA, &LR;  548 Agua Fria, (505) 982-8608. David Farrell, ex-Stars
and Postrio in San Francisco, cooks one of Santa Fe's best dishes,
a bowl of pleasingly plump mussels bathed in a broth enriched with
smoky, spicy chipotle chilies and lots of mint. End with the almond
butter cake with strawberries, a shortcake con brio.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SANTACAFE, &LR;  231 Washington Ave., (505) 984-1788. Perhaps the
planets were out of alignment, perhaps it was the recent eclipse,
but Santacafe failed to live up to its exalted reputation the last
time we had dinner there. The keen young service team struggled to
cope with a crowd in the pretty garden, and of seven dishes we
tried, only two were real winners: balsamic-glazed quail and
Patrick Markby's fabulous summer pudding, a symphony of berries
that could not have been better if Jane Grigson herself had made
it.

   A Change Of Scenery &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Say goodbye to Arthur Miller's ``Death of a Salesman.'' And say
hello to ``The Price.''
</P>
<P>
   Word this week that ``Death of a Salesman'' would close on Nov.
7 was quickly followed by news that a revival of ``The Price,''
Miller's 1967 play, would open on Broadway two days later, at the
Royale Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arthur believes it's never had a great production in New
York,'' said David Richenthal, lead producer of ``Salesman'' and
``The Price.'' ``I hope this production helps discover the play.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of two brothers locked in a battle over their loyalty
to family, ``The Price'' comes to New York after appearing at the
Williamstown Theater Festival in August. The four-person ensemble _
Jeffrey DeMunn, Bob Dishy, Harris Yulin and Lizbeth Mackay _ is
being directed by James Naughton.
</P>
<P>
   From a financial standpoint Richenthal seems to be betting that
lightning strikes twice. ``Salesman,'' after all, began a
nine-month run at the Eugene O'Neill Theater with stellar reviews,
lunched on a bushel of Tonys and will end with its producers
pocketing a healthy profit. (Who says it's a sad story?)
</P>
<P>
   Richenthal said the inability to find a replacement for Brian
Dennehy, the production's Willy Loman, was the main reason for the
close.
</P>
<P>
   Among the actors who had declined to follow in Dennehy's sizable
footsteps were Albert Finney, Stacy Keach and Charles Durning.
</P>
<P>
   Dennehy, hoarse from performing, denied that his health had
played a role in the decision to close, but admitted that playing
Willy was not easy: ``I'm 61 years old, and this is a tough deal.
November was always a target. And there's something inside of me
that says it's time to move on.'' He added that he would have
missed a week's worth of performances in mid-November to shoot a
movie.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the hunger for theaters, the O'Neill was snatched
up as soon as it was available; the next tenant will be ``Wrong
Mountain,'' David Hirson's absurdist comedy, opening on Dec. 14.
</P>
<P>
   At the John Golden Theater, meanwhile, ``Side Man'' is heading
south, to Washington. The show closes its yearlong Broadway run on
Halloween before embarking on a monthlong run at the Kennedy Center
for the Performing Arts on Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The move makes way for the comedian Jackie Mason, who will begin
performances of his latest, ``Much Ado About Everything,'' at the
Golden on Nov. 16.
</P>
<P>
   It has been an impressive run for ``Side Man,'' which began
performances at a 99-seat theater in the East Village before
leapfrogging to Broadway. Along the way two of its leads, Edie
Falco and Frank Wood, became stars. Ms. Falco won an Emmy Award
this week for her work in ``The Sopranos,'' and Wood won a Tony for
``Side Man.'' The play's author, Warren Leight, won the Tony for
best play in the 1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the accolades, the production will probably earn back
only half of its initial $750,000 investment on Broadway. But Jay
Harris, one of its producers, explained that regional productions
are in the offing for Cincinnati, Chicago, Seattle and
Philadelphia, and that the play's commercial producers will share
almost half of any movie deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suspect the subsidiary rights will help us recoup and make
a profit,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   The producers of ``Salesman'' needn't wait. Richenthal declined
to go into specifics, but box office figures show that ``Salesman''
probably earned almost $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The success of ``Salesman'' should be satisfying for Richenthal,
who lost big money on the critically acclaimed, financially
disappointing productions of Horton Foote's ``Young Man From
Atlanta'' in 1997 and Robert Schenkken's ``Kentucky Cycle'' in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's enormous satisfaction to have a production work on all
wheels: critical, financial and artistic,'' he said. ``It's been
win, win, win, win.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   House Hunting &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like other artistic directors, Douglas Aibel of the Vineyard
Theater has his favorite playwrights, and Craig Lucas is one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   When Lucas offered his latest play, ``Stranger,'' to the
Vineyard, Aibel said yes immediately, even though the company lacks
a place to show it because the season at Vineyard's East 15th
Street Theater is full.
</P>
<P>
   So Aibel is hunting for a stage for ``Stranger,'' which is about
a random meeting between two people, one of whom has done something
terribly, terribly wrong. ``We're leaving no stone unturned,''
Aibel said, adding that he hoped to find a theater within two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to rehearse in December for a January opening in a
house that seats 99 to 199 people. The director Mark Brokaw has
committed to the project, as has Mary-Louise Parker, whose history
with Lucas goes back to ``Prelude to a Kiss'' in 1990. She also
appeared in Brokaw's last outing at the Vineyard, ``How I Learned
to Drive,'' the 1998 Pulitzer winner by Paula Vogel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am keenly aware of the fact that the combination of these
parties would be so valuable to the play and that we had a window
of opportunity to put them together,'' Aibel said. ``We all just
connected with the play immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Now they just need a theater. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Along the Way &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ After talk of a Broadway run, ``The Unexpected Man'' by
Yasmina Reza, who wrote ``Art,'' is going Off Broadway under the
auspices of the Roundabout Theater Company. Eileen Atkins will
star, as she did in London. Nick Nolte, who was rumored for a New
York run, will not appear; the search is on for a male lead.
Performances are scheduled to begin at the Gramercy Theater on Jan.
14.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two Off Broadway shows appear to be hits before their first
performance. Producers of ``James Joyce's `The Dead,''' the musical
adaptation of the Joyce short story, has already sold out its
initial six-week run at Playwrights Horizon. Performances begin on
Oct. 1. At the Greenwich Street Theater the producers of Douglas
Carter Beane's new play, ``Country Club,'' have announced a
four-week extension. Previews began on Tuesday.

KEEDS NEED ACTIVITY, BUT HOW MUCH IS TOO MUCH?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Monday, Kathryn and Michelle have dance class. Tuesday, only
one of them has volleyball practice, so that's an easy day.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, says their mother, Traci Destena, Michelle has
dance and her other sister, Heather, has tumbling and dance
classes. Or is that dance and track?
</P>
<P>
   Destens laughs and wonders out loud how she does it all, whether
this is extracurricular overkill.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband is constantly telling me we're doing too much,''
the Fort Worth mother says. ``But my philosophy is to keep them
busy so I don't have to worry about them getting into trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping her child out of trouble is also one of the reasons
Valerie Robertson of Fort Worth says she lives a hectic life,
chauffeuring her daughter from activity to activity. Moriah
Robertson, 13, has volleyball practice at 7 a.m. most days. On
Wednesday nights, when she does not have volleyball or basketball
games, she goes to GAP, a Christian fellowship meeting at St. Paul
Lutheran Church. She also has swimming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just gets nuts,'' says Valerie, who as a single mother
occasionally relies on her boss, parents and friends to help get
her daughter from here to there.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? Kids today are busier than ever, participating
in organized sports in record numbers and taking on activities that
leave them less time for unstructured play and good old outdoor fun
than today's baby boomer parents enjoyed during their childhoods.
In the past two decades, the change has been significant: According
to a 1998 University of Michigan study that provided the first
detailed look since 1981 at how American children spend their time,
free time _ defined as time left over after eating, sleeping,
personal care, attending school, preschool or day care _ has
decreased from 40 percent to 25 percent of a child's day.
</P>
<P>
   Kids have less time for the simple business of being kids.
Something to worry about?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some children thrive on that stuff, and it really seems to be
good for them,'' says David Cross, associate professor of
psychology at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth. ``But
parents have to exercise common sense. They have to realize that
more isn't necessarily good.''
</P>
<P>
   Child psychologists agree that too much activity can do more
harm than good. Overloading children with everything from soccer to
piano to gymnastics can create a sort of obsessive-compulsive need
for activity, they say. But figuring out how much is too much is
not a simple matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are so individual,'' says Alice Wiedenhoff, staff
psychologist at the Child Study Center in Fort Worth. ``There are
some kids who thrive on having almost every moment of their day
filled and some who need downtime. It's everything in moderation.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiedenhoff said that kids need to be well-rounded, and a variety
of extracurricular activities allows for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, the bottom line is that parents need to be
responsive to the individual child's interests and desires,'' she
says. ``One of the hard things is there's a really fine line
between meeting the needs of parents and those of the child.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there are no hard-and-fast rules about the amount of
time kids should spend in extracurricular activities, drawing the
line between kid-initiated and parent-pushed activities is the key,
say experts. Many agree that the best approach is to allow the
child to choose the activities.
</P>
<P>
   Problems may come when parents _ for reasons varying from
wanting to keep kids out of trouble to trying to live out their own
dreams through their kids to wanting to boost their child's resume
for college admission _ cram together a tight schedule that leaves
kids almost no room for relaxing. Cross says that the pendulum has
swung from a time when kids had little except their imaginations to
occupy them after school and on weekends to now, when it often
seems as if every minute of their lives is planned by their
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because most activities children partake in are of a
competitive nature, there isn't enough time left in the day for
kids to be kids,'' Cross says. ``They have to achieve. They have to
grow up. They don't have downtime to decompress, even though we all
need that.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Mountrose, a California-based educator and author of
``Tips and Tools for Getting Thru to Kids,'' warns that there is a
``kind of escalating unconscious competition going on in the
country,'' and urges parents to remember that ``the back yard is
still there. It doesn't have to be abandoned.''
</P>
<P>
   Mountrose also says that parents who believe that keeping
children busy is a deterrent to temptations such as drugs and
alcohol and hanging out with the wrong crowd are fooling
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``What counts in the long run is the relationship between parent
and child,'' he says. ``Provide activities for your kids, but make
sure it's not a substitute for creating family bonds, dialogue,
trust and the real security parents are looking for to make their
kids responsible grownups.''
</P>
<P>
   The secret to finding a proper balance, Mountrose says, depends
on the child. The other part depends on whether the parents are
leading a healthy life or only sacrificing for their child.
</P>
<P>
   When the push for more and more activity seems to come from kids
themselves, rather than their parents, though, the results are
usually happy.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Luper, 17, of the Fort Worth suburb of Hurst, is Exhibit
A.
</P>
<P>
   He is vice president of the senior class council and Fellowship
of Christian Athletes, plays on the L.D. Bell High School football
team and belongs to various other committees and sports teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always stuff,'' says his mother, Karen Luper, who
added that Kevin's day sometimes starts as early as 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Luper said that she is happy that her son is involved with so
many positive things. Although she sometimes worries whether he's
putting himself under too much stress, ``he seems to thrive on
it,'' she says. ``These are Kevin's choices.''
</P>
<P>
   For some families, though, letting go of the mind-boggling
assortment of activities is the answer.
</P>
<P>
   But after years of trying to juggle soccer, basketball,
horseback riding and softball, Jennifer Baspeds and her husband and
their daughters are tuckered out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not doing soccer this semester at all,'' says the
Kennedale mother.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the only activity on the schedule for Basped's two
daughters is English horseback riding _ once a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't scheduled that yet, but it will be on the same day,
at the same time, and that will do it for us until after
Christmas,'' Basped says. ``I'm elated.''  &QL;

ANTIQUES: ALL AT ONCE, OUTPOURINGS OF ASIAN ART 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``It's almost too much,'' said Jim Lally, a Manhattan
dealer who specializes in Chinese works of art, discussing the many
events scheduled for Asia Week, the name given by New York auction
houses and dealers to this week's sales of Asian art, which end
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Lally, who said he would do his show in March, said it was
exhausting to view the previews, then to attend five days of Asian
sales at Doyle's, Christie's and Sotheby's in addition to seeing
special exhibitions at private galleries like Alvin Lo on East 57th
Street.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 70 exhibitors from the United States, Europe, Asia
and Australia are selling antiques at the Arts of Pacific Asia
Show, which runs through Saturday at the 69th Regiment Armory at
26th Street and Lexington Avenue. And on Sunday aficionados of
Asian art head to Washington for the opening of a National Gallery
of Art show, ``The Golden Age of Chinese Archeology: Celebrated
Discoveries From the People's Republic of China,'' which runs
through Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   In New York there has been a wealth of Asian furniture and works
of art for sale this week, the same week that the World Monuments
Fund, a nonprofit group that raises money to save cultural sites,
released its new list of the 100 most endangered sites around the
world, 21 of which are in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the auctions show is the magnitude of cultural resources
of China,'' said Bonnie Burnham, president of the fund. ``What
we're pointing out is what neglect China's cultural sites find
themselves in.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued: ``There is extraordinary material on the market
at the moment. Our list shows incredible material in advanced
states of decay. There is a tradition of neglect in China, but the
Chinese are now working to preserve what they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the interesting works in the fine-furniture department
this week were several showstoppers and several sleepers that
Christie's was offering.
</P>
<P>
   The most amusing is the ultimate in portable furniture, a rare
folding, reclining armchair from the 17th century, usually called a
``drunken lord's chair.'' It is a version of a West Indian
planter's chair.
</P>
<P>
   Antique Chinese furniture is made without nails, and this chair
comes apart to the extent that it folds flat enough to carry under
your arm. It is made of huanghuali, the most revered Chinese
hardwood, which is difficult to carve, and is highly polished,
perhaps too highly. The serpentine wooden armrests, anchored by
tenons, easily flip up, allowing the seat and the back to go flat.
The headrest folds down beneath nicely carved dragon-head finials
on the top rail. And the footrest folds flat.
</P>
<P>
   While the handsome brass decorations on the top rail are not
original, said Theow-Huang Tow, the international director of
Chinese works of art for Christie's, the brass decorations on the
side and the iron cross bar are original. There are few traces of
wear on the armrests and the footrest, but there are traces of red
lacquer on the bottom, which means that it might once have been
lacquered.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, the chair is as comfortable as it is beautiful,
unlike a Chinese scholar's chair, which is all form and no
function.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Chinese screens were once considered an
obligatory element in a fine traditional decor, especially one by
Sister Parish, Mario Buatta or Mark Hampton. There were two
remarkable screens at Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   The first has 12 panels and is nearly 11 feet tall. Made of
huanghuali, the screen has upper and lower panels with openwork.
The top panels have incised decorations, mostly pictures of
precious scholar's objects. Tow said the space between the top and
bottom panels, now covered in plain, cream-colored cloth, probably
would have once displayed calligraphy or landscape paintings.
</P>
<P>
   The second piece, a Coromandel lacquer screen, also has 12
panels. It dates from the Qing Dynasty and was made during the
reign of Emperor Kangxi, who spurred his imperial workshops to make
the best possible examples of glass, porcelain, textiles and
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Although made in China, Coromandel screens were named for
English East India Co.'s port on the Coromandel coast of India, a
post on the way to the West, through which the screens were
shipped. The screens often portray scenes of courtly life at a
gentleman's villa, Tow said.
</P>
<P>
   This one is unusual because it is done in brown, not black,
lacquer. It also has a long dedication in Chinese on the back,
which says it was presented to Magistrate Tian in Fujian in 1687 on
his birthday and commissioned by 30 emissaries, magistrates and
administrators. The screen is signed and stamped with the seal of
an official of the Imperial Academy who composed the text.
</P>
<P>
   The carvings on the piece tell a story almost the way a comic
book does. Inside its deep border are scenes of celebration at a
wealthy man's house. The gentleman is on a dais in the center of a
large open pavilion, in front of a ceremonial screen.
</P>
<P>
   A large man, elaborately dressed, he sits in a yoke-back chair,
a symbol of power, with two attendants holding giant banners behind
him. From his perch, he can view his gardens and see his guests as
they approach on covered walkways.
</P>
<P>
   Other carvings depict the ladies of the house, off in a separate
reception hall. Each carries her own symbol of wealth or power,
like a scepter. As the guests arrive, and grooms attend to the
horses, some women dance. Two children watch a cockfight without
disturbing a pet deer.
</P>
<P>
   Above this picture, in the border on top, the artist has laid
out a series of the items of value that a gentleman owned: hand
scrolls, brush pots, an incense burner, a vase of peacock feathers
and a piece of coral. Below that is a menagerie of real and
mythological animals, including tigers, buffalo and dragons, which
are auspicious symbols.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, much of the furniture and objets d'art shown on
the screen was displayed next door this week at Christie's
showroom: lacquered straw boxes, large wooden brush holders and
several pieces of furniture. All were for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The least pretentious, but totally elegant, piece of furniture
at Christie's was a small huanghuali side table, only 32 inches
high and 28 inches across. Nick Grindley, a London dealer,
pronounced its proportions perfect.
</P>
<P>
   It had a slight ridge at the edge of the top, called a
water-stopping molding, and most unusual, a shallow hidden drawer.
Its long, tapering coltish legs ended in small hoof feet.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Flacks, a Manhattan dealer in Chinese furniture,
preferred something else _ a simple huanghuali Ming bench with a
soft mat seat and high hoof feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely right in every way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lally, who rarely buys furniture, said, ``It's the star of the
show.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After dumping flooding rains of 3 to 10 inches over a large area
from eastern Virginia to New England on Thursday, the remnants of
Hurricane Floyd will move steadily away from the Northeastern
states Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Rain will end Friday morning in the New England states from
southwest to northeast. Showers will linger in the northern
mountains through much of the afternoon. Strong winds from the
northwest averaging 20 to 30 miles an hour with higher gusts will
accompany the return to drier air in the wake of the storm. Most of
the interior Northeast will have ample sunshine, although some
puffy cumulus clouds will form near the Appalachians. Afternoon
temperatures will be within a few degrees of the seasonal average.
</P>
<P>
   After a cool dawn, abundant sunshine will boost temperatures to
comfortably warm levels this afternoon in most of the South.
Humidity will be low except over southern Florida, where the return
of tropical moisture will promote widely scattered thundershowers.
Very warm air will surge into the northern Plains as winds from the
southwest combine with plentiful sunshine. Farther south, clouds
and a few showers will linger from the eastern slopes of the
southern Rockies to western parts of Oklahoma and Texas as moist
winds ascend the sloping terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Generally dry and warm weather with abundant sunshine will cover
most areas west of the Rockies. A few afternoon thunderstorms will
form over the mountains of northern Arizona, eastern Nevada and
southern Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Foreshadowing Floyd &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was the wettest day on record at Wilmington, N.C., yet
much of the rain fell when Hurricane Floyd was more than 200 miles
from the city. The daily total was 13.38 inches, smashing the
previous record for 24-hour rainfall of 9.52 inches set in
September 1938. The rain began late Tuesday as tropical air ahead
of the hurricane surged into the Carolinas. A nearby stalled front
became the focus for showers to develop along. This was related to
the hurricane's movement, but was an indirect effect. Thursday, the
Northeast Coast was soaked in a similar way. &QL;

 &HT;    `Under A Wing' daughter's loving memoir of growing up a
Lindbergh
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Two years ago, Reeve Lindbergh _ youngest child
and second daughter of the famed aviator _ got up close and
personal with the Spirit of St. Louis for the first time. During
off hours, a cherry picker hoisted Lindbergh and son Ben within
touching distance of the plane, which hangs suspended from the
ceiling of the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum. ``I
touched the plane, put my hand on the handle,'' Lindbergh recalled,
and for one transcendent moment, she was transported to 1927 and to
one of the century's great adventures _ an adventure that
determined her own fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, Ben,'' she raved, ``this is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah,'' the boy enthusiastically replied. ``I've never
been in a cherry picker before.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh laughed, realizing that her children _ from Ben's
spirit of living in the moment to the dimple in the chin of
daughter Susannah, born months after Charles Lindbergh's death in
1974 _ bring her closer to her father than any airplane ever could.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was so much like him,'' she recalled. ``My father lived
very much in the now.'' So much so that she could never prevail
upon him to talk about his trans-Atlantic flight: ``If you asked
him about it, he would laugh and say, 'Read my book; it took me 17
years to write it.'''
</P>
<P>
   You won't find the cherry-picker anecdote in Lindbergh's 1998
memoir, ``Under A Wing'' (Delta, $12.95), but the story is typical
of the book's insightfulness and frequent tone of amused affection.
</P>
<P>
   This is a decidedly untrendy memoir in this post-``Mommy
Dearest'' period. Wouldn't the payoff have been greater had she
written a whiny volume about an overbearing, often absent father?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh no,'' Lindbergh, 53, protested, ``I was well cared for, and
warmly and kindly raised by my parents. I loved the way they
created a family in spite of everything they endured. As we look
back on the older generation, our children are looking back on us,
so it behooves us to be careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh nonetheless speaks unflinchingly about her parents,
from her father's controversial pre-WWII isolationism to her
mother's recently revealed affair with her physician in the '50s.
But her lyrically written memoir brims over with admiration and
love and gratitude, crediting her parents' remarkable partnership
with creating ``a family structure that became the strongest
element in their lives ... and the strongest element in mine.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child and young woman, Lindbergh couldn't be bothered with
reading her mother's books. As an adult, she cherishes them as a
way of bringing her closer to her mother, now 93, after a series of
small strokes has made communication more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   And she has followed her mother's example not only as a writer
but as a memoirist. Although she has written novels and continues
to write children's books, she has a stronger sense than ever of
her adult voice. ``Working with family material is what I'm most
interested in and what I do best,'' she said. ``I do my writing in
a sense to pay tribute and also to understand, to figure it out for
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh was born in 1945, decades removed from both her
father's flight and the tragic 1932 kidnapping of the brother she
never knew, Charles Jr. (She first learned about the kidnapping by
reading a Life magazine retrospective.) Lindbergh, who was born
gregarious, concedes she was often frustrated by her parents'
compulsive reclusiveness: ``I could not understand why he could not
sign autographs and meet people. My father would leave restaurants
when people would recognize him, and I thought, 'What a pain.' I
thought it was all about him. Now I realize it was all about us.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh lives on a farm in St. Johnsbury, Vt., with her writer
husband, Nathaniel Tripp. Her mother, who lives nearby, inspired
her to write as a child and continues to be an inspiration today.
``My mother was always writing, and she believed if you had
anything interesting to say, you had a moral and aesthetic
obligation to write it down. And my father always told me, when you
write it, use permanent ink.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh admires A. Scott Berg's landmark biography
``Lindbergh,'' which recently won the Pulitzer Prize, in spite of
such intensely personal revelations as Anne Morrow Lindbergh's
affair in the '50s with her physician and friend, Dr. Dana Atchley.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Lindbergh discounted sister Anne's belief that their
mother had an affair, protesting, ``They're too old.'' Today, she
has accepted the probability: ``Both of these men are dead. My
father, lovely as he was, was difficult and just gone much of the
time. Immoral person that I am, I personally think it was a
wonderful thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh said her mother, who gave Berg unlimited access to her
husband's thousands of boxes of papers, isn't aware the biography
reveals the affair. When her son Land asked her opinion of Berg's
562-page tome, Anne Morrow Lindbergh delivered one of the pithiest
pieces of recent literary criticism: ``It's very heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   When he asked what she thought of all this new attention to her
late husband, she replied, ``I'm for Lindbergh.''
</P>
<P>
   Land raised his glass and said, ``I'm for Lindbergh, too,'' and
mother and son shared a toast.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Reeve Lindbergh said, is more lucid today than
several years ago, when she was disoriented by a stroke: ``She
tends to be monosyllabic, but she does tend to be on the mark.''
</P>
<P>
   And her response to her daughter's book? ``She said it was about
a fearless heroine,'' Lindbergh said.
</P>
<P>
   The remark is true, she added, if her mother applied it to
herself. Her mother sustained her not only through the loss of her
sister Anne to cancer in 1994, but through the loss of a son nearly
10 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most moving chapters is ``The Lost Baby,'' a saga of
intergenerational loss and courage. One morning, while staying at
her mother's house in Connecticut, Reeve Lindbergh went to wake up
her 2-year-old son, Jonathan, and found him dead. (He suffered a
seizure related to infant encephalitis.) Her first impulse was ``to
scream and run from the room _ anywhere, everywhere,'' but her
mother begged her not to do it, Lindbergh wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw my child's body, after he died,'' she said to me,
sitting beside me in my chair and beside Jonathan's still body in
his crib. ``I never sat with my son this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Lindbergh wrote, she might ``run, flee, shriek, explode,
tear the world apart.'' But at that moment, instead, ``we were
sitting together, my mother and I, sitting quietly next to that
crib in that house, not with one dead baby, but with two.''
</P>
<P>
   For her mother, the experience was ``just a terrible, terrible
echo,'' Lindbergh said. ``She was extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Extraordinary. It's a word often used to evoke Charles
Lindbergh's life in all its remarkable phases, from aviation to
conservation.
</P>
<P>
   But Reeve Lindbergh likes to think less of the ways her father
was unusual than the ways he was ``very representative of this
country and this century,'' she said. ``He came out of the agrarian
past, and jumped into the technological age, and he brought with
him the strengths and weaknesses of the technological age,'' she
said. ``He grew tremendously; he became very open and
philosophical, and I give him great credit for that.''

NOEL COWARD CENTENNIAL APPROACHES: A BLITHE SPIRIT AS LIFE FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Never had a nervous breakdown looked so glamorous. It
was one thing to fall to pieces onstage; characters in plays had
been doing that since ``Oedipus Rex.'' But it was something else to
come unglued in exquisite evening clothes while stormily playing
the piano, with a chic little gold box filled with something
illegal in your pocket. Nicky Lancaster might be a petulant,
mother-fixated egotist, prone to hysterics and addicted to drugs,
but it was impossible not to be mad about the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Thus was Noel Coward propelled into the fame that he would wear
with such satisfied crispness for the rest of his life. He was 24
then, almost exactly as old as the 20th century, and starring in
his own drama ``The Vortex,'' which had only barely squeaked past
the government censors. Tout le beau monde of London trekked to the
Hampstead theater in which ``The Vortex'' opened: le beau monde was
shocked; le beau monde was thrilled. The venerable matinee idol
Gerald du Maurier lamented, ``The younger generation are knocking
at the door of the dustbin.'' The novelist Stella Gibbons would
later recall of Coward's appearance in the play, ``He seems to me
incarnate the myth of the '20s (gaiety, courage, pain concealed,
amusing malice).''
</P>
<P>
   Soon to follow was the inevitable West End transfer, bolstered
by panting newspaper and magazine articles on this thoroughly
modern star who, though scarcely the self-destructive lotus eater
of his play, knew it couldn't hurt for people to think he was.
Photographs appeared of Coward in bed, wearing (in his own words)
``a Chinese dressing gown and an expression of advanced
degeneracy.'' Suddenly men of all classes were dressing and talking
like Coward, all ``sleek and satiny'' as Cecil Beaton described it,
and a new kind of celebrity _ sharp, shiny and supremely
self-conscious _ had slid into the public discourse.
</P>
<P>
   A character in ``The Vortex'' says of the ``divinely selfish''
Nicky, with prophetic reference to the young man who conceived and
portrayed him, ``I'm quite sure Nicky will be happy as long as he
goes around attracting people; he loves being attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Noel Coward, the playwright, actor, composer, fiction writer and
cabaret star who would have turned 100 on Dec. 16, did indeed love
being attractive. It was an essential part of his art, and in his
later years he could never understand the young actors who made a
point of looking unkempt. Star quality, as the critic Kenneth Tynan
wrote, was Coward's Holy Grail, a trait of which he said happily,
``I don't know what it is, but I know I've got it.'' And to allow
stellar light to dim or tarnish was to him a grave act of
irresponsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The celebrations surrounding the Coward centennial this fall,
which range from film and television festivals to New York
productions of two of his late works (``Waiting in the Wings,''
``Noel Coward in Two Keys''), bear witness to the staying power of
this impeccably maintained persona. They also speak of the stamina
of a man who entered show business as an 11-year-old child actor
and never really left it until his death in 1973, refusing to let
his public image sag even as his critical and popular reputations
yo-yoed exasperatingly.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the key features of that image had been engraved in
Coward's epochal appearance in ``The Vortex,'' a production he
chose to have mounted over another property he had ready, the
delicious (and far superior) ``Hay Fever,'' because he knew it
would make a bigger noise. Later writing of that time in the memoir
``Future Indefinite,'' Coward said: ``All that was important for
monotonous future reference was the created image _ the talented,
neurotic, sophisticated playboy. ... It still exists today, with
the slight modification that I am now an aging playboy.''
</P>
<P>
   There were also essential distinctions to be made between Nicky
and Noel. Nicky Lancaster was the victim of what Coward described
in song as ``those 20th-century blues,'' the malaise that settled
on the youth of Britain after the First World War. Coward was the
victorious manipulator of that same sensibility, the chronicler of
a flaming hedonism that he never allowed to consume his own talent.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs, by the way, were anathema to him; as his longtime
assistant Cole Lesley wrote, he had ``an absolute horror of losing
control of his senses.'' This meant that love, whose predations
Coward documented so wryly in plays like ``Private Lives,'' was
always regarded as dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   For all its attention-grabbing sensationalism, ``The Vortex''
was less subversive and more puritanical than the great,
``lighter'' comedies for which Coward became best known. ``The
Vortex'' morally condemned its two most charismatic characters:
Nicky and his vain, professionally beautiful mother, Florence.
</P>
<P>
   In works like ``Hay Fever,'' ``Private Lives,'' ``Design for
Living'' and ``Present Laughter,'' glamour would be equated not
with decadence but with vitality. Glamour becomes a life force,
bringing light and animation to a drab, gray world of outmoded
values. Life in Coward's urbane comedies of manners (as opposed to
his more sentimental and patriotic plays in which the middle and
lower classes figure) can be divided into those who have it and
those who do not.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for example, the characters in ``Hay Fever,'' revived
this summer in London under Declan Donnellan's direction. The
members of the Bliss family, at whose country home the play is set,
are both insufferable and irresistible. Headed by the actress
Judith Bliss and her woolgathering novelist of a husband, the clan
is self-obsessed, self-indulgent and self-dramatizing. But everyone
else in the play at least temporarily falls in love with them, and
they are undoubtedly of that breed who whenever they enter a room,
to paraphrase Coward, raise its temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto Elyot and Amanda, the divorced couple in Coward's
masterwork, ``Private Lives'' (recently produced at the Royal
National Theater in London), who have the misfortune to reunite
during their honeymoons with two other people. Despite the
ferocious incompatibility that regularly leads them to blows and
tantrums, Elyot and Amanda, in parts fitted on Coward and his
lifelong friend Gertrude Lawrence, are made for each other.
</P>
<P>
   They speak the same glittering language, in which the frivolous
becomes dead serious and vice versa, and their poor, utterly
conventional new spouses can't begin to understand them. That
Amanda's marriage to the handsome, prosaic Victor is doomed is
evident once he says to her, ``I'm glad I'm normal,'' and Amanda
answers: ``What an odd thing to be glad about. Why?''
</P>
<P>
   Does this sound like elitism? Of course it does. But it's
important to note that the particular snobbery of these plays isn't
based on traditional notions of class. Coward and Lawrence, child
actors both, were scarcely products of upper-class backgrounds. The
emblems of brittle, whimsical sophistication they became were
willed, artificial constructs that could accommodate even Coward's
homosexuality in a society where it was still a jailable offense.
The title ``Design for Living'' says it all.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The sexually ambiguous trio of that comedy (written for and
first enacted by Coward, Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne) love, fight
and recouple into various combinations. But they aren't allowed to
settle into a happy menage a trois until they have all become
wildly successful in their different artistic fields (play writing,
painting, decorating).
</P>
<P>
   By the play's end they represent an aristocracy of freshly
minted stars, set in relief by the stodgy socialites that surround
them. Their rules are their own, and they ply them with blithe
arrogance. One thinks of the playwright John Osborne, an angry
young man of a later age, when he described Coward's self-invention
as his great contribution to the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Coward was a sucker for real royalty. (He became great chums
with both the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret.) Yet it was his
self-invented characters who established the new conversational
tone for fashionable society _ sprinkled with ``darlings,''
``divines'' and a host of ironic superlatives _ that endures today.
</P>
<P>
   It is a mistake to dismiss Coward-speak as merely shallow.
There's a very modern bravado in the frivolity, a sense of people
gallantly waving sparklers in a newly darkened world. As Elyot
famously says to Amanda during a discussion of death: ``Let's be
superficial and pity the poor philosophers. Let's blow trumpets and
squeakers, and enjoy the party as much as we can, like very small,
idiotic schoolchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the works of Oscar Wilde (whom Coward described as ``a
tiresome, affected sod''), in which filigree elegance becomes an
end in itself, Coward's plays implicitly place bright archness over
a limbo ungoverned by any knowable god. He specialized in profound
superficiality. This may be why his comedies never translated very
well into Hollywood films in a country that prefers superficial
profundity, evidenced by the sort of spiritual and self-help books
found on best-seller lists.
</P>
<P>
   Tynan went so far as to argue that Coward's dialogue anticipated
that of Harold Pinter, citing the resonant line from Coward's
``Shadow Play'': ``Small talk, a lot of small talk, with other
thoughts going on behind.'' (It makes sense that in the 1950s, when
Coward was railing against the kitchen-sink dramatists, he had
praise for Pinter, ``at least a genuine original.'') Tynan also
provided a wonderful summary of Coward's contribution to the
language of the theater: ``Coward took the fat off English comic
dialogue: he was the Turkish bath in which it slimmed.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement hints at the discipline that informed every aspect
of Coward's life. It extended from his writing habits to his rigid
insistence, when directing, that his actors know their lines on the
first day of rehearsal; from his clipped, staccato delivery of his
own songs and dialogue to the careful presentation of his public
self. ``I take ruthless stock of myself in the mirror before going
out,'' he told Beaton.
</P>
<P>
   Elements that might erode this discipline were to be avoided if
possible. Sexual attraction was perceived as an anarchic force,
probably doubly so given Coward's status as a gay man in England in
the early part of this century. ``I am no good at love,'' went one
of his song lyrics. And in his 50s he wrote in his diary of a
current infatuation, ``All the gallant lyrics of all the songs I
have ever written rise up and mock me.'' This clash of order and
romantic chaos is an abiding theme in his plays, from ``Private
Lives'' and ``Blithe Spirit'' to the wistful ``Song at Twilight,''
in which he made his last appearance as a stage actor.
</P>
<P>
   His public rarely saw him in any sort of disarray. The Coward it
knew was the jaunty, waspish and eternally sleek star of the
cabaret acts he began in the 1950s. ``One's inside self is a
private place and should always stay like that,'' he once said.
Tantrums, depressions, doubts: the display of these was reserved
for the intimate surrogate family of assistants, friends and his
companion of decades, the actor Graham Payn.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Design for Living,'' the playwright Leo describes life as
``a question of masks, really; brittle, painted masks.'' He
continues, ``We all wear them as a form of protection; modern life
forces us to.'' Knowing that you're wearing a mask inevitably leads
to a certain self-detachment, which may be the most modern element
of all in the Coward mystique.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always acting, watching myself go by,'' says Garry
Essendine, Coward's alter ego, in ``Present Laughter.'' As this
century ends, with a renewed emphasis on the conscious manipulation
of style and image, Coward seems especially pertinent. Certainly he
anticipated the current crop of chic, irony-wrapped, androgynous
young movie stars and pop idols.
</P>
<P>
   These descendants might also do well to follow the master's lead
in self-deprecation. As the novelist Rebecca West wrote of Coward,
after lamenting his colossal narcissism and addiction to applause:
``His sensitivity knew this and was shocked, and he regularly
rough-housed his own vanity by considering himself in a ridiculous
light. This he did for the good of his soul.''
</P>
<P>
   SPECIAL EVENTS:
</P>
<P>
   A host of events marking the 100th anniversary of the birth of
Noel Coward is planned in New York City this year. ``Mad About the
Boy: Noel Coward on Film,'' a 10-part screening series, begins
Friday and runs through Oct. 21 in the Rose Cinemas at the Brooklyn
Academy of Music. During the same weeks ``Mad About the Boy: Noel
Coward on Television,'' a five-part screening series, will be at
the Museum of Television and Radio. From Sept. 23 to Oct. 5 the
Museum of Modern Art will present the Billy Rose Tribute to Noel
Coward, a film retrospective. Beginning on Nov. 3 his musical
``Sail Away'' will be presented at Weill Recital Hall. In December
``Noel Coward in Two Keys,'' a pair of one-acts, will be performed
(theater and dates to be announced). On Dec. 1 a special
performance sponsored by the Mabel Mercer Foundation is planned at
Carnegie Hall. Previews begin on Dec. 3 at the Walter Kerr Theater
of his comedy ``Waiting in the Wings.''

SPOTLIGHTING A NEW ALBUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GONZALO RUBALCABA: ``Inner Voyage'' Blue Note/Capitol).
</P>
<P>
   The pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba has worked in several different
idioms over the last decade, including straight-ahead jazz, Latin
jazz and fusion, but the one quality most associated with him is
muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of other trained Cuban musicians, he puts a premium
on technique, and his ability to improvise on harmony with clear
articulation at high speed and with dramatic flourishes is both his
strength and his downfall; there's often something interior missing
amid the formidable skill.
</P>
<P>
   It was just the challenge for him, then, to make a slow album.
Not just a ballad album; he's done his share of playing ballads and
displaying superheroic sensitivity. But a slow album, slow as in
molasses, slow as in slow-motion.
</P>
<P>
   Playing effectively this way can be just as technically
impressive; the time quantities in which to place just one note
become enormous, and pulling a feeling of tension across all that
space separates the glib from the gifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inner Voyage'' ends up being perverse at times, almost as if
Rubalcaba were turning his back to the audience or looking for a
way to disappear. But perversity is exactly what one desires from
him, and in any case it's a particularly beautiful form of
perversity.
</P>
<P>
   With the bassist Jeff Chambers and drummer Ignacio Berroa,
Rubalcaba seldom rises louder than the sound of a drum stick
clicking a rim; he melts into his rhythm section in tracks like
``Joan'' and ``Promenade,'' and the tunes float as if they were not
actually moving.
</P>
<P>
   Only two tracks raise the tempo and break the spell: a version
of Juan Tizol and Duke Ellington's ``Caravan,'' which sticks too
close to the standard's frame, and an original called ``Blues
Lundvall,'' which contains some of the most death-defying piano
playing since Art Tatum.

 &HT;    Gray's latest offers parenting tips
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In John Gray's universe, men are from Mars, women are
from Venus, children are from heaven, and parents are ... well,
parents are just overwhelmed and confused.
</P>
<P>
   Some moms and dads try to be buddies with their children, then
wonder why the kids won't behave. Some act like prison wardens to
maintain order, then worry that their kids aren't creative enough.
Finding middle ground between hard and soft parenting seems
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Which is where Gray fits in. Or at least his new, common-sense,
``positive-parenting'' guide, ``Children Are From Heaven'' (Harper
Collins, $25.95, 357 pages).
</P>
<P>
   The way the author of the best-selling ``Men Are From Mars,
Women Are From Venus'' sees it, parents need take only five easy
steps to give children the freedom to ``discover and express their
true selves.'' Children are always going to resist guidance, says
Gray, a family therapist, but there are ways to manage that
avalanche of rebellion without turning the home into Devil's
Island. He says:
</P>
<P>
   _ Let children be different. This will allow them to develop
their ``unique inner potential and purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Let them make mistakes. Children who correct themselves will
better learn from their missteps.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tell children it's OK to express negative emotions. According
to Gray, this will teach them to manage their emotions and develop
a ``feeling awareness.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Tell children it's OK to want more. They will develop a
healthy sense of what they deserve and learn to delay
gratification.
</P>
<P>
   _ Give them permission to resist parents' guidance. Doing so
will help children develop a better sense of themselves, and by
learning to manage a child's resistance, parents stay in control
while also giving their child freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Now, wasn't that easy? Gray seems to think it is. And here's
another easy fix: Trim the hours kids spend watching TV. Parents
rely too much on the boob tube at a time when they need desperately
to interact with their children, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of parents try to parent and get all this resistance, so
they just park their kids in front of a video or a TV set and
there's, like, this nice six hours of calm in the house, so they
assume everything is fine,'' he said. ``A lot of parents have no
idea what goes on inside their children's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Parenting styles today are a convoluted mess inspired by
previous generations, Gray says. Parents who are too soft are most
likely avoiding the hard-as-nails approach of their own parents.
Others get tough because their own parents were soft and didn't
pass along skills for managing their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a kind of environment that embraces all of these
different freedoms,'' Gray said. ``Let's just come forward and
acknowledge that we want to give these to our children. And yet, to
balance that so our children will be healthy and whole, we need
strict control.''
</P>
<P>
   So, strictness is OK in moderation, as long as it's not too
strict. Gray uses the example of a parent with a 7-year-old who
doesn't want to wear a jacket to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some parents say, OK, let the child experience the
consequences of not wearing a jacket instead of going through what
it takes to make the child wear the jacket,'' he said. ``What this
child experiences is that not only are they not prepared to meet
the challenges of the world, but they feel they can't trust their
parents to protect them as well. Children need to feel a dependence
on their parents and that they can depend on their parents.''
</P>
<P>
   So, at whom is this book aimed _ good parents who want to do
better or mediocre moms and dads who don't have a clue and have
never bought a parenting guide?
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope with this book is that parents who wouldn't normally
realize that they need help would hear from other parents or
teachers that this is a helpful manual,'' Gray said. ``Parents are
recognizing that what they're doing isn't working and they're
looking for answers.''

   ERXLEBEN _ AUSTIN _ Attorneys representing as many as 300
investors are expected to file a lawsuit Thursday against the law
firms and accountants that advised Austin Forex, Russell Erxleben's
ill-fated, foreign-currency trading firm. It's been almost a year
to the day that Austin Forex closed its doors, leaving scores of
investors financially devastated. As Erxleben, who claims he's
broke, slowly twists, waiting to see if he'll be indicted for his
role in the debacle, investors are now searching for elsewhere for
deep pockets. (Pletz, Austin American-Statesman).

 &HT;    LCRA water fight fodder for the Legislature
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In brief remarks to the crowd gathered for Sen.
Gonzalo Barrientos' re-election announcement last week, Lt. Gov.
Rick Perry said this: ``I've learned that of the 31 members who
serve in the Texas Senate, this man has the toughest
constituency.''
</P>
<P>
   There was laughter.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Barrientos said one of the reasons _ but not the
only one _ he is running again is ``because the Austin City Council
needs me.''
</P>
<P>
   There was more laughter.
</P>
<P>
   It's hardly a state secret that legislative reaction to Austin
and its hyper-political citizenry runs the gamut from bemusement to
contempt. Austin bashing is popular sport, supported for fun and
profit by lobbyists with an array of clients with a variety of
interests. The curious nature of municipal politics keeps Austin's
enemies stocked with eye-rolling anecdotes they gleefully relay to
an audience that can't get enough of them.
</P>
<P>
   What's keeping them in yucks lately is the microscopic analysis
of the water deal offered by the Lower Colorado River Authority.
While Austinites insist on worshiping at the altar of process,
legislators and others around the state are once again shaking
their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Tell anyone outside of Austin that the council is balking at
securing a 50-year supply of water at a 30 percent discount and
they'll look at you as if you were from the planet Zotz.
</P>
<P>
   Although the deal is said to have majority council support, the
doubts raised about it and the delay in signing the deal makes
people who would jump at the deal wonder what's wrong with us.
</P>
<P>
   Should the support erode, they won't wonder any more.
</P>
<P>
   I asked an influential member of the Legislature how members
would react if Austin booted the water deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody would say anything right away,'' he
drawled, ``but six or so years from now, when you come to the
Legislature asking to bail you out, we'd tell you what we told
Corpus Christi and San Antonio: 'You had your chance, so (action
verb) you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Asked the same question, another influential member couldn't
stop laughing at first, then declined, saying between guffaws that
he didn't want to be perceived as meddling in local affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The demands of office bring legislators to town between sessions
more often, so they are getting more than the biennial dose of the
local charm these days.
</P>
<P>
   Process is ingrained in the local political culture. Nothing
moves in a hurry, and people are quick to express their effrontery
if they have even the slightest notion that they've been excluded
from something whether they have anything constructive to add or
not. It's a wonder they have time, though, given their regular and
lengthy attendance at the Temple of Righteous Indignation.
</P>
<P>
   Because the rate of participation in local elections is low,
local politicians are hesitant to offend any constituent group that
claims a membership of more than five. So, we do process. Political
junkies love those meetings. True story: I once heard a member of
an advisory board say that she didn't allow her children to play
war games. Instead, she taught them how to play meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Around here, it's the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we could just learn to tell the Legislature, 'Yeah,
we're different. In the way that East Texas is different and in the
same way that the Valley is different,''' sighed a political
consultant. ``But, instead we use that corruption language'' in
communicating with legislators who don't see things in the ``Austin
way.'' We just love to tell them off.
</P>
<P>
   And legislators just love it when we do. It gives them something
to write about every couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   A modest prediction: This ongoing hand wringing over the LCRA
deal is going to result in a miracle. It has the potential of
turning water into ink.

 &HT;    The race for Perry's job _ if we need a race
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The race to be the next lieutenant governor is
on _ despite an effort by one of the Senate's most respected
members to keep it from happening.
</P>
<P>
   Factors that may affect who wins include whether senators want
to make the office less powerful; whether the senator chosen would
seek the position at the next election or just be a caretaker; and
whether Gov. George W. Bush, if elected president, might resign as
governor early to help the Republicans hold the lieutenant
governor's position.
</P>
<P>
   The senator openly campaigning is David Sibley of Waco, who is
telling his colleagues he's willing to discuss giving the
lieutenant governor's powers to appoint committees and their chairs
and set the order of legislation to the Senate. He also said he
might serve as lieutenant governor only until the next election and
then seek re-election to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   By actively campaigning, he's ignoring the wishes of good friend
and fellow Republican Bill Ratliff of Mount Pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff wrote in a June 3 letter to senators that he feared an
active race could bring the warfare and lingering resentments
typical of races for House speaker.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time Texas senators have known almost two
years ahead that a vacancy might exist in the lieutenant governor's
office. If Bush wins the presidency in 2000, Lt. Gov. Rick Perry
will become governor.
</P>
<P>
   Should that happen, the Texas Constitution requires the 31
senators meet within 30 days of a vacancy and choose one of their
own to be the acting lieutenant governor, while holding on to the
Senate seat. The senator chosen could decide later whether to run
for election as lieutenant governor or re-election to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff's letter said he would ``consider it the highest
compliment'' if the senators chose him to succeed Perry. But he
strongly counseled against a ``speaker's race'' campaign where
pledges of support are collected.
</P>
<P>
   To do otherwise, Ratliff said Tuesday, could endanger the
collegial environment usually present in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   On June 8, Republican Teel Bivins of Amarillo followed with a
letter saying he would be ``deeply honored'' if senators chose him
but would not campaign for it.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley, however, sent Ratliff and Bivins letters on Aug. 6,
pledging that while they would remain friends no matter what, he
was concerned that if senators wait until after the November 2000
general election, a ``vacuum'' might develop that would hinder ``a
timely and productive start'' to the the next session of the
Legislature in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Republican J.E. ``Buster'' Brown also would like the job, but
telephoned his colleagues asking them to ``keep their powder dry''
until a vacancy actually occurs. (Brown's chances, other senators
say, weren't helped by a young woman in his district office
recently filing a sexual harassment complaint.)
</P>
<P>
   Republican Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio, caught Tuesday as he
was between planes headed for 12 days in China, said he's talked in
person to about 10 colleagues. While he'd like the job, he said
he's mostly asking senators to avoid diluting the presiding
officer's powers.
</P>
<P>
   Wentworth said he wants ``a direct relationship with one
president of the Senate,'' rather than a committee of senators.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican jockeying could be moot if Democrats win a Senate
majority in the next general election. There are 15 of them, to 16
Republicans, and the Democrats could be in the majority if they can
take back the East Texas seat held by Republican Drew Nixon of
Carthage and hold Democrat David Cain's Dallas-to-Tyler seat.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic majority might produce a Democratic lieutenant
governor _ most likely moderate-conservative Ken Armbrister of
Victoria, unless a schism produces a deal crossing party lines that
could go in many different directions.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats interested include Royce West of Dallas and Mike
Moncrief of Fort Worth. But Senate Democratic Caucus Chairman
Gonzalo Barrientos of Austin has also urged his colleagues to
refrain from campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   If the Democrats win a majority, would Bush quit early, so the
current Senate rather than the new one would pick Perry's
successor?
</P>
<P>
   Bush won't say. ``The governor will deal this issue when the
time comes,'' spokeswoman Linda Edwards said.

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `THE ASTRONAUT'S WIFE,' starring Johnny Depp and Charlize
Theron. Directed by Rand Ravich (R, 100 minutes). Stylish direction
and the heat generated by these two stars can't outweigh the
familiarity of the story line. It concerns an astronaut who returns
to Earth behaving a little strangely. And not for nothing does Ms.
Theron, as the title character, wear the hairdo seen on Mia Farrow
in ``Rosemary's Baby.'' Even creatures in other galaxies can guess
what's coming. Still, the visual style suggests that this
first-time director might fare better with fresher material. And
Depp holds interest by playing the astronaut as one part NASA, two
parts Elvis (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT,' starring Heather Donahue, Michael
Williams and Joshua Leonard. Directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo
Sanchez (R, 87 minutes). A horror film shot outdoors by its actors,
who play three scared filmmakers at work on a spooky documentary,
this is a fine example of how to make something out of nothing _
nothing but terrific imagination and a game plan so enterprising it
should elevate its creators to pinup status at film schools
everywhere. With tentacles including a hit Web site, an elaborate
fake witch mythology, a book tie-in, a special on the Sci-Fi
Channel and more, this clever indie is at the center of a new form
of synergy and an inspired multimedia blitz (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BOWFINGER,' starring Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy and Heather
Graham. Written by Martin. Directed by Frank Oz (PG-13, 97
minutes). This hilarious, good-hearted spiritual descendant of
``The Producers'' is a comic coup for Martin. And it's directed by
Oz every bit as winningly as his ``Dirty Rotten Scoundrels'' and
``In and Out.'' Murphy is razor sharp in a dual role as both a
grinning fall guy and the kind of hotshot action star whose very
presence is enough to get a movie made. Martin, sublimely funny,
runs circles around him as an unscrupulous filmmaker trying to
trick the star into appearing in his movie. ``Did you know that Tom
Cruise had no idea he was in that vampire movie until two years
later?'' this filmmaker inquires. Made fondly and knowingly, with
nonstop good humor (Maslin). `CHILL FACTOR,' starring Cuba Gooding
Jr. Directed by Hugh Johnson (R, 110 minutes). A deadly chemical
defoliant (military code name Elvis) must be transported to a safe
place across the Montana high country in a rattling ice cream
delivery truck before it falls into the hands of a maniacal traitor
who wants to peddle it on the international market. Gooding,
clowning it up, is the hapless driver. Stale macho jokes and
formulaic cliffhangers drive this chase-by-numbers thriller on the
bumpy road to nowhere (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `EARTH,' starring Aamir Khan, Nandita Das, Rahul Khanna and Maia
Sethna. Directed by Deepa Mehta (Not rated, 99 minutes). It is
1947, and India is about to explode into ethnic violence as British
colonial rule ends and the country is partitioned into two nations,
mostly Hindu India and mostly Muslim Pakistan. These momentous
changes are observed by Lenny (Ms. Sethna), the 8-year-old daughter
of a well-to-do Parsi family in Lahore. As Hindus, Muslims and
Sikhs slaughter one another in the streets, old friends become
deadly enemies. Caught in the middle is Shanta (Ms. Das), Lenny's
beautiful Hindu nanny who has two Muslim suitors. The movie's
child's-eye view somewhat mutes its dramatic sweep (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `DUDLEY DO-RIGHT,' starring Brendan Fraser, Alfred Molina, Sarah
Jessica Parker and Eric Idle. Directed by Hugh Wilson (PG, 90
minutes). Based on the vintage Jay Ward animated series, this
live-action romp tries to be both zany entertainment for children
and nostalgia for those who grew up on Ward's snarky creations
(Rocky, Bullwinkle et al.). And it works pretty well, too. Beyond
the sure-fire goofy presence of Fraser and the comic possibilities
of a Canadian Mountie who rides his horse backward, this jokey romp
has an appealing, try-anything spirit. The characters now use cell
phones. And Ms. Parker's Nell, who formerly spent her time tied to
the railroad tracks, has become a former U.S. ambassador to Guam.
But the formula hasn't lost its fun (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `EYES WIDE SHUT,' starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
Directed by Stanley Kubrick (R, 145 minutes). This last cryptic,
spellbinding addition to the Kubrick canon provides a stunning
epiphany for the summer of the dirty joke. It's a dead-serious film
about eros and mortality, one that flirts with the ridiculous but
sustains its fundamental eeriness and gravity throughout. Cruise,
as a doctor caught up in a nighttime sexual odyssey of strange,
dreamlike clarity, and Ms. Kidman, as the wife who sparks his
jealousy by speaking frankly of her own libido, give themselves
over body and soul to the filmmaker's meticulous and delicately
balanced scheme. Given the dark themes and explicit nudity found
here, the R rating, achieved by digital alterations to 65 seconds'
worth of film, is a joke (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `OUTSIDE PROVIDENCE,' starring Shawn Hatosy, Alec Baldwin and
Amy Smart. Written by Peter Farrelly, Bobby Farrelly and Michael
Corrente. Directed by Corrente (R, 95 minutes). Three of Rhode
Island's finest, the director of ``Federal Hill'' and the brothers
behind ``There's Something About Mary,'' collaborate on a rowdily
funny yet also unexpectedly tender coming-of-age tale. This rueful
and very likable comedy tells of a Pawtucket teen-ager who is
abruptly separated from his druggy old cronies and packed off to a
Connecticut prep school, where he is a sharp-eyed observer of the
characters around him. Loosely knit, sometimes uproarious, the film
benefits enormously from Baldwin's deft performance as the boy's
small-minded, memorably impossible father (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE RED VIOLIN,' starring Samuel L. Jackson, Jason Flemying,
Greta Scacchi and Don McKellar. Directed by Francois Girard (not
rated, 130 minutes). ``The Red Violin'' follows the colorful
300-plus-year journey of a priceless violin from its construction
in an Italian workshop in 1681 to a contemporary auction in
Montreal. As it makes its way from Vienna to England to China, the
instrument becomes the inspiration for some richly photographed
historical tableaux. If the movie's narrative energy is undermined
by a plodding screenplay and wooden acting, the music, composed by
John Corigliano and played by Joshua Bell and the London
Philharmonia Orchestra, is sublime (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `RUNAWAY BRIDE,' starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere.
Directed by Garry Marshall (PG, 110 minutes). When the stars and
director first collaborated, on ``Pretty Woman,'' Ms. Roberts was
cast as an adorable Los Angeles streetwalker. Nine years later
she's as far as she can get from Rodeo Drive, geographically and
otherwise. Playing the stern proprietor of a small-town Maryland
hardware store, she takes an awfully long while to slip from
scowling into flirtatious romantic-comedy mode. And when the sparks
start flying between her character and Gere's likably stubborn
newspaper columnist, they fly on cue. Funny minor characters and
one-liners offset the not-so-pretty story of a woman who habitually
jilts her men (Maslin).

 UNDATED: jilts her men (Maslin). 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `THE SIXTH SENSE,' starring Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment.
Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan (PG-13, 107 minutes).
What starts out as a horror movie about a troubled 8-year-old boy
(Osment) who claims to see dead people, and the child psychologist
(Willis) determined to cure him, eventually turns into New Age mush
(think ``What Dreams May Come'' and ``Simon Birch''). When you
trace the plot backward after its big secret is revealed, the story
doesn't begin to add up. Willis gives his usual smirking one-note
performance. What empathy the movie generates comes from Osment's
intense portrayal of the tormented child (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `STIGMATA,' starring Patricia Arquette, Gabriel Byrne and
Jonathan Pryce. Directed by Rupert Wainwright (R, 102 minutes).
When Frankie Paige (Ms. Arquette), a vapid Pittsburgh hairdresser,
receives the present of a rosary lifted from the dead body of
Brazilian priest, her life becomes a supernatural horror show.
Byrne is the Vatican cleric who investigates the case and Pryce the
evil cardinal who wants to cover up evidence that could damage the
church. The seizures in this poorly acted melange of shock effects
and religious imagery are bargain-basement ``Exorcist.'' Instead of
pea soup and spinning heads, we get breaking glass, dripping blood,
flurries of feathers from agitated doves (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `STIR OF ECHOES,' starring Kevin Bacon and Kathryn Erbe.
Directed by David Koepp (R, 99 minutes). Another little boy talks
to a ghost at the start of this thriller, but it isn't an instant
``Sixth Sense'' sequel. Instead, it shows what happens when the
boy's closed-minded father lets himself be hypnotized and awakens
to find himself receiving otherworldly stimuli. Bacon gives a
grippingly intense performance as a man terrified by his new
extrasensory powers. And Koepp conveys a potent sense of what it
means to unravel. Despite its strong, spooky start and early
momentum, the film winds up with too earthbound an explanation for
the havoc it unleashes (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `T-REX: BACK TO THE CRETACEOUS,' starring Peter Horton and Liz
Stauber. Directed by Brett Leonard (not rated; 45 minutes).
Passions for the prehistoric that remain unsated after the two
``Jurassic Park'' films are likely to be requited by this latest
Imax 3-D film. Drooling and menacing, the monsters of the Mesozoic
are on the march again in this brief, enjoyable dip into
paleontology, teen-age adventure and parent-child relationships.
Seen in 3-D and set against the lush ferns, moss and ancient trees
of the Olympic rain forest in the state of Washington, these
creatures seem marvelously lifelike. Better yet, ``T-Rex,'' written
by Andrew Gellis and Jeanne Rosenberg, doesn't rest on its
technological splendors. Its time-tripping story takes the viewer
to a paleontological dig, raises unanswered scientific questions
and introduces some of the major figures in the history of the
subject. To be sure, seeing ``T-Rex'' won't qualify anyone for a
doctorate in paleontology, and an intriguing subplot that hints at
a troubled family background for its teen-age heroine is left
unresolved; but the film is likely to whet active young minds to
learn more about the past. (Lawrence Van Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   `TEACHING MRS. TINGLE,' starring Helen Mirren, Katie Holmes,
Marisa Coughlan and Barry Watson. Written and directed by Kevin
Williamson (PG-13, 93 minutes). Three teen-agers dislike their
nasty history teacher, so they go to her house, tie her to her bed
and hold her hostage. Surely this had a more honest viciousness
when it was first written by Williamson, who went on to write the
``Scream'' movies, ``Dawson's Creek'' and ``I Know What You Did
Last Summer,'' but it has been absurdly soft-pedaled into a kinder,
gentler version. Retitled ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle'' from ``Killing
Mrs. Tingle,'' and no doubt with its ending changed accordingly, it
works overtime trying to make the high schoolers sympathetic. As
the teacher, Ms. Mirren is much too good for this material
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE 13TH WARRIOR,' starring Antonio Banderas and Omar Sharif.
Directed by John McTiernan (R, 103 minutes). Set in the 10th
century and adapted from a novel by Michael Crichton, this
grunting, sweating, blood-gushing medieval answer to professional
wrestling is inspired by Ahmed Ibn Fadhlan's historical account of
his adventures in Central Asia. Banderas plays an exiled Persian
poet who hooks up with a group of Norse warriors to do battle with
an evil tribe of flesh eaters. The screenplay is monosyllabic, but
the action scenes, which take you into the thick of battle, are
excitingly photographed. A charging score by Jerry Goldsmith helps
ennoble the grisly derring-do (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR,' starring Pierce Brosnan, Rene Russo
and Denis Leary. Directed by John McTiernan (R, 114 minutes). It
was the stars, Faye Dunaway and Steve McQueen, who made this story
sexy the first time around; now it's the showy big-ticket
accouterments. Brosnan and Ms. Russo seem to share the most
heartfelt moment in this halfhearted romance when they jointly go
shopping. McTiernan is better known for the action in his ``Die
Hard'' and other movies than for the tender moments therein. So the
museum heists here are more convincing and exciting than the scenes
of carefully staged amour (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TRICK,' starring Christian Campbell and John Paul Pitoc.
Directed by Jim Fall (R, 90 minutes). This engaging, tenderhearted
boy-meets-boy story features two handsome, doe-eyed actors in the
story of a romantic one-night stand. As in the Doris Day-era sex
comedies that are recalled here, the story is filled with obstacles
to the affair, the most noxious of them Tori Spelling in the role
of an incorrigible nuisance. Fall gives a small-town coziness to
his film's Greenwich Village settings and makes this a quaintly
likable date movie for audiences of any persuasion (Maslin).

`SPIRAL JETTY' GIVEN TO DIA; A LONG-LOST INGRES; '99 CARNEGIE
INTERNATIONAL 
</HEADLINE>

   `Spiral Jetty' Given to Dia
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Spiral Jetty,'' Robert Smithson's monumental
Earthwork, has been given to the Dia Center for the Arts by the
artist's estate.
</P>
<P>
   That Dia should become the caretaker of one of Smithson's
greatest works is fitting. ``It's part of Dia's forever mission to
take care of epic projects that don't fall within the normal scope
of a traditional museum,'' said Michael Govan, its director.
</P>
<P>
   The gift helps establish Dia as the center for giant works in
the landscape. It owns Walter De Maria's ``Lightning Field,'' near
Quemado, N.M., which it maintains and makes available to the
public. Dia also provided the initial support for James Turrell's
``Roden Crater'' near Flagstaff, Ariz., and supports Michael
Heizer's work in the Nevada desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spiral Jetty,'' created in 1970 on the Great Salt Lake in
Utah, is made of black basalt rocks and earth from the site,
forming a coil 1,500 feet long and 15 feet wide that stretches out
counterclockwise into the lake's translucent red water. ``Spiral
Jetty' is submerged in the lake because it was built when the
lake's water was unnaturally low. Before Smithson died in a plane
crash in 1973, when he was 35, he had considered adding further
material to insure that ``Spiral Jetty'' would be more visible.
</P>
<P>
   Govan said that Dia was studying ways to make ``Spiral Jetty''
more accessible. He also intends to collect and centralize the
historical documents that relate to the project. ``We plan to
acquire other works by Smithson,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dia has scheduled a viewing of a film that the artist made of
the ``Spiral Jetty'' and its making; it will take place on the roof
of Dia's building at 542 W. 22nd St. in Chelsea on Sept. 29 at 7
p.m. The film will also be included in the Whitney Museum of
American Art's exhibition ``The American Century: Part II,
1950-2000,'' which opens Sept. 26.
</P>
<P>
   A Long-Lost Ingres
</P>
<P>
   When ``Portraits by Ingres: Image of an Epoch'' opens at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art on Oct. 5, it will give viewers a peek
at who was who in France from the last years of the Revolution to
the Second Empire.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the portraits are well known to art historians, a
full-length image of Queen Caroline Murat, Napoleon's youngest
sister, painted in Rome in 1814, is being shown in a museum
exhibition for the first time. Its whereabouts had been unknown for
125 years until a dealer recognized it in a restorer's studio in
Belgium in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The painting shows the queen wearing a hat trimmed with ostrich
feathers, standing in front of the window of her private chamber in
the Palazzo Reale in Naples. It was recorded by the historian and
writer Mario Praz in his 1964 book ``An Illustrated History of
Interior Decoration.''
</P>
<P>
   Praz showed a black and white image of the portrait, along with
other pictures of the queen, to illustrate the decorative
metamorphosis of this part of the palace from Empire decor to
Biedermeier furnishing. But Praz did not know who painted the
portrait.
</P>
<P>
   The portrait records an important moment in Ingres' history. For
starters, Ingres was never paid for the portrait, even though it
was completed and delivered to his patron, the queen's husband,
Joachim Murat, because Caroline lost her throne after the Battle of
Waterloo when the French administration was expelled from Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Ingres called the painting an ``unhappy success,'' because the
queen was dissatisfied with the way he painted her head and her
hat, which he painted over three times but never successfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of Ingres' most enigmatic portraits,'' said Gary
Tinterow, the Englehard curator of European paintings at the Met.
``It is also one of the smallest, most jewel-like of Ingres'
finished portraits, and its aura is heightened because it was even
lost to the artist, who hoped to obtain it for several
exhibitions.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Carlier, the Belgian dealer who discovered it, was able
to sell the Ingres portrait to a New York collector, who is now
lending the painting to the exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The Carnegie
</P>
<P>
   Two and a half years and hundreds of visits to artists' studios
have gone into the making of the 1999 Carnegie International, the
survey show of contemporary art that takes place every few years at
the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh. The last one, in 1995,
was organized by Richard Armstrong, then a curator of contemporary
art at the Carnegie and now its director. This year's show is
overseen by Madeleine Grynsztejn, who filled Armstrong's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1995 the show reflected upon the heritage of Minimalism,''
Ms. Grynsztejn said. ``My concern is with artists at the end of the
millennium and with what constitutes reality in this day and age.''
</P>
<P>
   The show opens Nov. 6 and runs through March 26, featuring the
work of 41 artists from 22 countries. Some are young, emerging
artists; others are well known. The youngest is the American
painter Laura Owens, 29, and the oldest is Alex Katz, 72. ``I felt
a cross-generational conversation was important,'' Ms. Grynsztejn
said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the show would also be carefully balanced to include
painting, sculpture, mixed media, film, video and site-specific
installations. ``Each Carnegie International is different because
each reflects its moment in time,'' she added. ``We live in a world
where information circulates at an incredible pace, and this has
had a tremendous effect on the art that is produced.''
</P>
<P>
   An Inaugural Award
</P>
<P>
   To recognize collectors who embody Duncan Phillips' commitment
to encouraging public appreciation of art, the Phillips Collection
in Washington has created an annual award. On Saturday, the first
Duncan Phillips Medal will be given to Leonard Lauder, the
cosmetics magnate and art collector, who is also chairman of the
Whitney Museum of American Art.

<P>
   TORONTO _ One of the more interesting minitrends of the 24th
Toronto International Film Festival, which wraps up on Saturday,
was the unusually large number of films with sexually frank themes
and sexually explicit scenes, sometimes crossing into territory
formerly reserved for hard-core fare.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first of the festival's films to attract interest
among U.S. distributors was a French movie, ``A Pornographic
Affair,'' from the director Frederic Fonteyne that, while not
visually explicit, was a very intimately recorded account of a
couple's desire to have a liaison based on nothing but sex. Another
film to draw a lot of chatter early in the festival was
``Gojitmal,'' from the South Korean director Jang Sun-woo, a much
more explicit and discomfiting look at an increasingly
sadomasochistic affair between a 38-year-old man and an 18-year-old
girl.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most explicit of all, and a film that has drawn
widely mixed responses, was the French director Catherine
Breillat's ``Romance,'' which is to be released slowly throughout
North America, beginning in New York on Friday. The film is about a
young woman who, through a series of relationships, explores the
outer limits of her sexual experience, including sadomasochism. It
combines an intense philosophical viewpoint with some scenes as
explicit as can be found in any adult video.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my feeling that the powers that be, the government and
the church are trying to control people by censorship, by taking
them away from the physical experience of sex,'' said Ms. Breillat.
``I believe that physical love has a very metaphysical, a very
spiritual aspect. That is why those in power fear it. But it is
only by embracing this physical aspect, I believe, that we can go
through the taboo and reach the next level of our spiritual
evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   OK. But how is one to market such a film in the United States,
especially when the movie industry is under intense government and
public scrutiny over its use of sex and violence?
</P>
<P>
   ``Romance'' had its premiere at the Rotterdam International Film
Festival earlier this year and was later released in France under a
rating that excluded viewers under 16. Ms. Breillat said she did
not think that people that young should see her film, although she
disapproved of any form of censorship, even the film industry's
self-imposed Motion Picture Association ratings system in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The film's U.S. distributor, Trimark Pictures, released the
movie without submitting it to the association for a rating,
fearful that an NC-17 rating (no one under 17 admitted), which it
almost certainly would have received, would stigmatize the film and
mislead art-house audiences and those who expected a pornographic
flick.
</P>
<P>
   The film will not open outside New York until Oct. 1, said
Dennis O'Connor, senior vice president for theatrical marketing for
Trimark. ``I believe the film will get critical acclaim, and we
want to give those other markets time to react,'' he said. ``And
there are still a lot of major chains in other markets around the
country that are sitting on the fence about the film, waiting to
see how it is received in New York and elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Breillat has stirred controversy throughout her career,
which includes seven films and six novels. She is best known in the
United States for ``36 Fillette,'' which was shown at the New York
Film Festival in 1989 and is one of her least controversial
projects. It is about a young girl deciding whether to end her
virginity with an older man.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said Trimark had also decided to join one of the more
popular adult-oriented Web sites to help promote ``Romance,'' a
liaison that rarely occurs between the art-house and the
pornography worlds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film is very provocative, so you have to be very careful
how you market it,'' he said. ``You need to market it to adults who
prefer edgy, provocative films, some of whom still won't like it,
will find it too strong. But I think the people who don't like it
will at least respect what she's tried to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   In Purgatory
</P>
<P>
   And then there is ``Dogma,'' the controversial new film written
and directed by Kevin Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate that,'' said Smith, who had his first success with
``Clerks'' in 1994. ``It's never just `Dogma'; it's always `the
controversial ``Dogma.'' ' I know I should be a little happy
because we're getting some publicity out of it, but I'd rather do
without that publicity.'' He shook his head and pinched the bridge
of his nose. ``It's been a long six months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The film tells the story of two fallen angels, played by Matt
Damon and Ben Affleck, banished to Wisconsin for eternity, who
think they have found a loophole to get back into heaven.
Unfortunately, if they do, it will cause a cosmic chain reaction
that will mean the end of all life on earth. So another angel,
played by Alan Rickman, talks a descendant of Jesus, an
abortion-clinic worker played by Linda Fiorentino, into trying to
thwart the angels' plan.
</P>
<P>
   The film was initially backed by Miramax, a part of the Disney
empire, but when word got out about its subject, several religious
groups complained that its theme was anti-Catholic and demanded
that Disney not release it. Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman of
Miramax, agreed to buy back the negative from Disney and sell it to
another distributor so that neither Disney nor Miramax would have
any connection to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvey was great,'' said Smith, who was in the middle of a
series of public screenings and interviews at the Toronto festival.
``The film is not anti-Catholic, it is not sacrilegious. If
anything, it's faith-affirming. But having it at Disney just made
us both too big a target.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie was finally picked up this month by Lions Gate Films
for distribution in North America and is set to open in November.
The press and industry screenings in Toronto drew a mixed response,
not so much because of the religious content but because of the
broadness of some of the humor. The film seemed to go over well at
its public screenings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that the people who are criticizing the film
haven't seen it,'' Smith said. ``If they do, they may not think
it's funny, but I don't think they'll be able to call it
anti-Catholic.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that in the next few months he intended to work on an
animated series he was making for ABC. Six episodes are scheduled
to appear next spring, and if they are successful, subsequent
installments may be ordered. Based on ``Clerks,'' the series
follows the same characters, in animated form, through fresh
adventures, admittedly not as R-rated as the ones they encountered
in the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the PG material that my mother always wanted me to
make,'' Smith said. ``She's always saying to me: `Why do you have
to use those words in your movies? Why do they have to talk like
that?'''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Goodbye, Fake Blood
</P>
<P>
   While much of the film world was up here in Canada hashing over
the major studios' forthcoming releases and haggling over
independent acquisitions at the festival, the fall movie season is
getting under way in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Moviegoers might be forgiven for doing a small double take to
note that the director of ``For Love of the Game,'' a mainstream,
big-studio Kevin Costner vehicle about a Detroit Tiger ruminating
on the love of his life while pitching at Yankee Stadium, was none
other than Sam Raimi. The movie opens on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Raimi is best known to film enthusiasts as the director of
cult-horror favorites like ``The Evil Dead,'' ``Army of Darkness''
and ``Darkman.'' But last year he also directed ``A Simple Plan,''
a critically acclaimed drama about brothers who discover a bag of
cash in a snowbound plane. Still, his new move is even further
removed from his days of zombies-in-the-woods films, with their
tongue-in-cheek ironies and frenetic camera work.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time I was content to make entertaining horror
romps,'' Raimi said. ``Then after I was married and had some kids,
I looked around and said, `What do I want to do now?' My tastes had
changed. I'd gotten older. Before, I was simply trying to entertain
the audience with all that camera movement, with as wild a visual
gag as I could come up with. Now I thought I'd like to make a
picture that I'd like to see as an audience member.''
</P>
<P>
   He first tried to get the job of directing the baseball film
several years ago but could not persuade anyone that he had the
right temperament for the material.
</P>
<P>
   ``They turned to me and said, basically, it wouldn't be
possible,'' Raimi said.
</P>
<P>
   Then last year he met with executives at Beacon Entertainment
and mentioned that he was still interested in directing the movie.
A meeting was set up with Costner, who had by then become attached
to the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met with Kevin and told him how I planned to shoot it and to
direct him, and he was a gentleman, but I came away thinking he
wasn't particularly impressed with me,'' Raimi said.
</P>
<P>
   But he was invited to further meetings, then script conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never actually got the call that I had the job,'' he said.
``I just kept getting invited to meetings. And then one day I got
to the set, and my name was on the chair.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. _ ``The City Different,'' they like to call it,
and that it is, a heady blend of Hispanic, Native American and
Anglo cultures, with a brisk topping up, these last few decades, of
new money, big money, from Texas, California and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Perched 7,000 feet above sea level on an alluringly undulating
plateau, dry but not arid, Santa Fe is a leafy faux-adobe city
built around a core of old adobe buildings _ some of them very old,
like the Palace of the Governors, the oldest governmental structure
in the United States, which over four centuries has flown Spanish,
Mexican and American flags.
</P>
<P>
   With only 67,000 people, the city has a cultural life worthy of
a European metropolis. The new Georgia O'Keeffe Museum, the
expanded, endlessly enthralling Museum of International Folk Art
and a cluster of new arts institutions housed in vivid buildings by
the Mexican master Ricardo Legorreta have breathed fresh life into
a venerable artistic heritage. So has SITE Santa Fe, with concerts,
literary readings, major one- and two-man shows and huge,
far-ranging biennials, all in a converted beer warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Each summer, the superbly inventive 43-year-old Santa Fe Opera,
playing in a brilliant new theater by James Stewart Polshek on a
hilltop north of town, draws visitors from all around the globe.
The annual Chamber Music Festival and extensive dance and theater
programs also help to make Santa Fe feel, in July and August, a bit
like Salzburg with margaritas. There is sorcery in the air here.
The city, Willa Cather wrote, lies ``at the base of wrinkled green
mountains with bare tops, wave-like mountains, resembling billows
beaten up from a flat sea by a heavy gale.'' Ancestral home of
Pueblo peoples with ancient traditions, the Santa Fe region has
been a magnet for strangers as long as man can remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about everyone comes to Santa Fe, sooner or later,'' said
Sam Ballen, the owner of La Fonda, the city's landmark hotel.
``Some of them are smart enough to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish founded La Villa Real de la Santa Fe de San
Francisco de Asis, the Royal City of the Holy Faith of St. Francis
of Assisi, early in the 17th century, about the same time the
English founded Jamestown. In the 18th century, conquistadors,
clerics and commoners followed El Camino Real, the Royal Road,
north from Mexico City. Early in the 19th, the wagon trains rolled
into town from Missouri along the Santa Fe Trail, and late in the
19th, the iron horse took over, with settlers arriving on trains of
the Atchison, Topeka &AMP; Santa Fe Railway.
</P>
<P>
   Artists fell in love with the magical Sangre de Cristo
Mountains, whose colors change with the passing hours and seasons,
and the intense, crystalline light that defines them so sharply at
dusk. Tourists fell in love with the artists, with tacos and
enchiladas, with the chunky turquoise-studded jewelry made by the
Indians and with the whole ``Santa Fe style'' _ relaxed yet
sophisticated, a mix of Chimayo rugs, distressed pine furniture and
tin-framed mirrors. Soon you could see it in million-dollar houses
in Greenwich and Winnetka and taste it in restaurants everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Coping With Growth
</P>
<P>
   Today, though, the soft-edged romance of Santa Fe is confronted
with a harsher reality. Downtown is choked with cars, with Land
Rovers and jalopies equally immobilized at rush hour. During
daylight hours in summer, the central Plaza belongs to the
tourists. Cerrillos Road is as nasty an urban eyesore, pocked with
motels and burger joints, as any in America.
</P>
<P>
   The preservationists have taken to the trenches, battling the
developers, and they have slowed if not halted the march of
``progress.'' Santa Fe has only a tiny airport. That and the
shortage of water should help to keep it from turning into another
Phoenix, but some of the local grandees are already muttering about
the Aspenization of their beloved city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly we're getting people who think they ought to build
hangars for their jets at the airport,'' said an old-line resident
who would like to pull up the drawbridge.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Santa Fe's past survives. ``The fragrance of pinon fills the
air. Santa Fe is a town of patios where hollyhocks nod, where
towering cottonwoods spatter with shade. Spain is stamped upon the
town. The old man who takes his siesta on a bench in the Plaza may
count among his ancestors a Spanish don who owned a rancho as big
as Delaware. Families still bear names like Delgado, Otero, Ortiz
and Sena.'' Those lines, from the Depression-era W.P.A. Guide to
New Mexico, are not so badly out of date 60 years on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every place grows,'' said Elizabeth Martin, a public-relations
woman who came here from Dallas. ``This place is growing better
than most. We don't have high-rises, and I don't think we will.
Scale is attended to. People think it's chic to live on a dirt
road. And even the developers can't take away the clouds in the
sky, the rainbows and the stars at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Road of Galleries
</P>
<P>
   The epitome of Santa Fe excess, I guess, is Canyon Road, two and
a half miles jampacked with galleries interspersed with cafes and
restaurants. Once artists lived there; now art fights for its place
with schlock and souvenirs. A lot of the stuff for sale, said the
cartoonist Patrick Oliphant, who spends summers here, ``isn't much
better than Elvis on velvet.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of it is. The Gerald Peters Gallery, near the head of
the road, sells works by Albert Bierstadt, O'Keeffe, George Rickey
and much lesser artists. Equally heterogeneous are the wares of the
nearby Nedra Matteucci Galleries, which handle California
regionalists and the early Taos painters. The Morning Star Gallery
sells exquisite old Indian carvings, baskets, pots and jewelry from
many tribes. Downtown, the Andrew Smith Gallery sells photographs
by Edward S. Curtis, Ansel Adams and other wizards of the gelatin
print.
</P>
<P>
   Since Santa Fe is one of the nation's largest art markets, I
asked Susan Conway, Oliphant's wife, who runs an admired gallery in
Washington, which of the smaller dealers she recommended here. She
mentioned Riva Yarres, Lew Allen, Munson and Allene Lapides for
contemporary paintings, as well as the Conlon Siegal galleries on
Gypsy Alley and Canyon Road.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked away in the same part of the city, behind high walls and
beneath mature aspens, apple trees and Ponderosa pines, are the
handsome adobe houses of some of Santa Fe's elite. Ms. Matteucci
and her husband, Richard, a wine wholesaler and accomplished
amateur cook, own one of them, built in the 1880s, with a tiled
plaque signed by Diego Rivera in the garden.
</P>
<P>
   Another gem, designed in the 1920s by John Gaw Meem, the leading
architect of the Adobe Revival here, belongs to Roddey Burdine, a
displaced Miamian, who has filled it with superb Native American
and Hispanic pieces. In an earlier life, the house was the site of
Greer Garson's marriage to Buddy Fogelson, an oil operator; the two
refugees from Hollywood lived here for many years and endowed
several buildings at the College of Santa Fe. Feast for
Museumgoers.

   RUSSIA-BOMB (Moscow) _ The scourge of terrorism spread to
Russia's heartland on Thursday, as a massive explosion tore apart
an apartment complex in the southern city of Volgodonsk. At least
18 people were killed and more than 200 wounded when a bomb went
off near a nine-story building. It was the fifth bombing in less
than three weeks and underscored how vulnerable Russia remains to
terrorist attacks despite heightened security. By Michael R.
Gordon. (With map.)

   CLEMENCY-PRIVILEGE (Washington) _ Citing executive privilege,
the White House refuses a congressional request for documents

<P>
   HURRICANE-RDP (Wilmington, N.C.) _ Hurricane Floyd comes ashore
near Cape Fear, N.C., with 110 mph winds, flooding the Carolina
coasts with more than a foot of rain as tens of thousands of people
huddled in shelters. At least seven deaths are blamed on the storm.
More than 480,000 people customers in the Carolinas and Virginia
have lost power. Flooding and power failures combined to shut down
Portsmouth, Va.'s water supply system, which serves 110,000
customers. By Francis X. Clines.

   HURRICANE-NY (New York) _ Hurricane Floyd brought its fierce
winds and torrents of rain last night to a New York region that was
waiting and well prepared, flooding roads and knocking out some
power but failing to inflict any devastating damage. By David W.
Chen.
</P>
<P>
   HURRICANE-NY-SCENE (New York) _ To a large extent, the city hid.
It wasn't always clear from what. Sure, Hurricane Floyd was
supposed to roar into town Thursday and topple buildings and
catapult buses over the World Trade Center _ but where was it? The
day the hurricane was due was very much a day of pointed contrasts
in the metropolitan area, with portions of the area being pounded,
while the city itself was tricked by a non-event. By N.R.

   TEXAS-SHOOTING (Fort Worth) _ Police on Thursday sought a motive
for the nation's latest killing rampage, a shooting spree that
began Wednesday night when a man spewing anti-Baptist rhetoric
burst into a church service for teen-agers and opened fire. Seven
people were fatally shot before the gunman _ identified by police
as Larry Gene Ashbrook _ killed himself at the Wedgwood Baptist
Church. Seven others were wounded, three of them seriously. By Jim
Yardley.

A LANDLORD WHO REMEMBERS RENTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday, Sept. 23)  
(lh) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some property owners may forget how it is to be a renter, to
walk into empty rooms with white walls and beige carpeting and
space for a garden out front and to declare it perfect.
</P>
<P>
   And then, because there are more than a hundred others before
you, to have to go back to the classifieds, the phone, the map and
start all over again.
</P>
<P>
   A woman whose name we'll change to Mary remembers her own days
of renting, so when she put an ad in the newspaper for a
two-bedroom, one-bath townhouse at the low Sonoma County, Calif.,
price of $725, she started feeling guilty almost from the
beginning, knowing she was bound to disappoint many people.
</P>
<P>
   She deliberately kept it low, because she says, ``I know how
hard it is to find a decent place, and I'm not in it for the
profit. People told me I could get $800, $825 or more, but I
deplore the horrible high rates.'' The phone kept ringing. Her
message machine filled. She heard from about 160 people in two
days. ``This is crazy,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Mary go through her stack of applications, telling
stories about the people she was going to have to call and say
``sorry'' to, it is clear that the landlord business is not for the
soft-hearted.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people told me what a wonderful deal this was, that
they'd been looking for so long, that even some $900 apartments are
dumps. Or they're not in safe neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a lot of greed out there. One retired woman
said she lives in fear that her landlord will raise the rent just
because he knows he can get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonoma County is a desirable spot, in large part because of its
diversity, Mary says, but how diverse or desirable is any place
that prices itself above people with marginal incomes?
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's our sense of reality? Most people are working class.''
</P>
<P>
   She looks at her list and asks, ``Do we want to lose people like
this?'' They include retail clerks, a warehouse manager, a
beginning acupuncturist, a social worker, a nonprofit agency office
worker, a customer service representative.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a full-time college student married to an agricultural
worker with a baby and a brother who would help share the rent.
Here's a pensioner who supplements by doing in-home care for an
elderly patient. A single mother who moved her two kids into an
$850 apartment and right back out because the owner refused to
clean it as promised. A working pair with a sick child whose
grandmother promised $500 a month toward the rent.
</P>
<P>
   Mary remembers a time when the rule was that housing should be
no more than a quarter of a family's income. But who, she wonders,
can do that today?
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have any idea how many young people have already been
through bankruptcy? People are living on the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary, a physical therapist, rented until she was 40, mostly in
San Francisco. She's familiar with the routine, ``staying with
friends while you look for someplace that you can afford and isn't
a dump.''
</P>
<P>
   She bought her place 15 years ago, qualifying as a low-income
buyer. She lived there for a while and then married. Now she lives
in a much larger house with her husband, and money is not the issue
it once was.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she says, ``Doesn't $800 seem like a lot?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we want to become just a haven for the rich.
Working people are what ground a community. If we lose them, we
lose a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   She's right. We lose artists and poets, people who work for
public radio, beginning teachers who can't afford to live in the
same town as their students.
</P>
<P>
   We create child-care hassles, long commutes, stressed-out
families needing two jobs, two cars.
</P>
<P>
   Mary has a good friend who works as a massage therapist,
massages AIDS patients for free and struggles to pay her $700 rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of an old Marxist,'' Mary says. ``I ask myself, why
we need so much and so many?''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of a week Mary had chosen. Her new tenant is a single
woman who works for a foundation that helps families in crisis. She
goes to the same church as Mary's brother-in-law and heard about
the house from him. Mary feels a little guilty for taking what she
considers ``the easy way out,'' but hopes the woman lives there for
a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like being in the rental business,'' Mary says. ``I
get too involved.''

SATURDAY'S FIGHT WILL DEFINE OSCAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By LOWELL COHN   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Don King opened his big mouth on Wednesday. Don King
opens his big mouth every day, but Wednesday was special even for
him.
</P>
<P>
   It was the final, ultra-deluxe press conference for Saturday's
so-called ``Fight of the Millennium'' between Oscar De La Hoya and
Felix Trinidad. King, who is the promoter for Trinidad, had
something to say to Bob Arum, De La Hoya's promoter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll bet you a million dollars,'' King shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Arum considered the proposal with a face so sour he looked as if
he'd just sucked on a lemon. Then Arum launched into a long sermon
about the evils of gambling, explaining that he would fire anyone
from his company who bet on fights.
</P>
<P>
   He said this to hundreds of reporters dying to dash out to the
craps tables.
</P>
<P>
   He said this in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, no one was persuaded. But one thing was clear.
King had called Arum's bluff, or to use the language of the
streets, he'd told Arum, ``Put your money where your mouth is.''
</P>
<P>
   King's dare was generally seen as a victory for his fighter over
De La Hoya. Or to put it another way: Arum's refusal to ante up the
cash was perceived as a vote of no confidence for De La Hoya. That
may be unfair, but the little world of boxing never has been about
fairness.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya should know that. He is called the Golden Boy, and
some experts consider him the best boxer in the world. But an
undercurrent of doubt persists. De La Hoya knows about the
undercurrent.
</P>
<P>
   It is said he is not Mexican enough. This criticism is cruel,
but it is out there, anyway. The knock against him is that he's a
hero to white America, not to Mexicans. He stands accused of
selling out.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of De La Hoya not being Mexican enough is also a
criticism of his boxing style. Fair or not, Mexicans are
stereotyped as face-first brawlers who enjoy taking a punch if they
then can administer one of their own. Bobby Chacon, now punch
drunk, used to delight boxing fans in San Francisco and Sacramento
with that rough style.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya will have none of that. He is tall and
slender-waisted, definitely not made for the hit-and-be-hit style
of boxing. He would rather avoid a blow than take one. And who can
blame him? Fact is, around certain neighborhoods in Los Angeles he
is perceived as lacking in machismo.
</P>
<P>
   He is also handsome. With his straight nose and square jaw he
looks like a smaller version of Clark Kent. This, some people hold
against him, as well. You see, De La Hoya doesn't want to get his
face messed up, not when it's up there on billboards selling all
kinds of products. At the press conference, he thanked his sponsors
(I counted six) for being ``on board with me.'' He's more like a
conglomerate than a pug.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing people wonder why he has had so many trainers. A guy
named Robert Alcazar is De La Hoya's official trainer, but for most
of his fights De La Hoya also has another trainer who's better
known than Alcazar. He has had Emanuel Steward, who developed
Thomas Hearns, and he has had former lightweight champ Carlos
Ortiz, and he has had a bunch of others. Right now, he has Gil
Clancy, who, years ago, brought along former welter and
middleweight champ Emile Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   The result of all these trainers, some insiders think, is that
De La Hoya has been taught too many styles, and sometimes these
styles conflict. If you believe this argument, you reach the
inevitable conclusion that he has no clearly defined style. He's
like a child prodigy piano player who has been taught by six
different music teachers with six different theories.
</P>
<P>
   Although De La Hoya has a gleaming smile, which seems to
indicate he has the world by the tail, it is said that he is a
lonely guy who trusts no one. His father, Joel, owns part of him,
but Joel never compliments his son. De La Hoya admitted this to the
media the other day. This lack of praise makes De La Hoya so gloomy
he doesn't want his father in training camp with him.
</P>
<P>
   Can you say the words ``dysfunctional family''?
</P>
<P>
   Although De La Hoya is known as a knockout puncher, some experts
believe, as he moves up through the divisions (he began as a
lightweight), he has not brought his punch along with him. And then
there's the issue of his chin. Some absolute mediocrities have put
him on the canvas, which makes you wonder about the tensile
strength of his jaw bone.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fact remains he is the most exciting, most marketable
fighter around, and he is probably the most talented. This is an
age in which casual fight fans care only about heavyweights. He has
made them interested in welters, guys who weigh 147 pounds. That's
an accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad is the best fighter De La Hoya has faced. If he beats
Trinidad, De La Hoya will eliminate the doubts, perhaps define
himself as a great fighter. Finally, that's what the Fight of the
Millennium is all about _ giving himself a definition. Anything
would be better than the question that constantly dogs him right
now: Who is Oscar De La Hoya?

ADVERTISING: INNOVATIVE ADS PROMOTE PRE-GAME SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than a decade, the testosterone-driven network studio
programs that precede National Football League games on Sundays
have been battlegrounds for analysis, player features and scoops on
signings, suspensions and injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox and CBS programs from noon to 1 p.m. are attempts to
lure fans to watch the games that come after the shows. And the
ESPN show, which now runs from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., is a huge
pre-game appetizer, a reminder to watch its game at 8:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Since its introduction in 1994, ``Fox NFL Sunday'' has preached
the entertainment value of its foursome: three former football
players _ Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long and Cris Collinsworth _ plus
former basketball player and longtime host James Brown. Their
interaction is packed with raucous banter, mainly between Bradshaw
and Long, a style that reached a new level last season with the
addition of the long-necked Collinsworth, who quickly became the
butt of their insults.
</P>
<P>
   To promote the program this season, Fox has transformed the
foursome into animated Claymation characters through the work of
Will Vinton Studios in Portland, Ore. Animating Bradshaw, Long,
Brown and Collinsworth makes sense: the Fox television network is
replete with cartoon series like ``The Simpsons,'' ``King of the
Hill,'' ``Futurama'' and ``The P.J.'s.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal was to appeal to younger viewers who have abandoned
the pre-game shows to watch other things and to break through the
clutter in a unique way,'' said Neal Tiles, the senior vice
president for marketing at Fox Sports. ``This was an easy way to
take the guys into a fantastical realm.''
</P>
<P>
   One spot is set in the Fox Television Network studio commissary.
Bradshaw uses a ketchup bottle and table utensils to diagram a play
when a stream of ketchup goes awry and lands on Ally McBeal, a
prime-time Fox star. She initiates a food fight by hurling a
drumstick at Bradshaw that is swallowed by John Madden (``Tastes
like chicken!'' he says), Fox's top game analyst.
</P>
<P>
   In a second spot, Collinsworth asks Long to switch seats on the
studio set with him. Bradshaw suggests they arm-wrestle. ``Cris,
are you sure?'' Brown asks. Within seconds, Long tears off
Collinsworth's arm, then uses it to gesture at viewers to watch the
day's games. ``Don't miss it,'' says Long, a former defensive end
for the Oakland Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't view CBS and ESPN and ABC as our competition,'' Tiles
said. ``We compete in a larger world of advertising with Nike and
Anheuser-Busch.''
</P>
<P>
   The spots were created by Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding San Francisco,
part of the FCB Worldwide unit of True North Communications. They
will run through December and include other Fox prime-time stars.
Fox is also buying time for the spots on wrestling programs on the
TNT and USA networks, ``South Park'' and ``The Man Show'' on Comedy
Central and the ``Howard Stern'' show on E! To reinforce the
marketing, Fox has licensed the four characters to Equity Marketing
to produce figurines for sale at mass merchandisers like Wal-Mart
Stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a novelty, we think our guys, in Claymation form, will
sell,'' Tiles said, adding that Fox is considering turning the
announcing quartet into Saturday morning cartoon crime fighters in
the mold of ``Scooby Doo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a great extension to talk to the next
generation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunday NFL Countdown,'' the football preview show on ESPN, a
unit of Walt Disney, is promoting itself by casting its announcers,
including Chris Berman, Tom Jackson, Sterling Sharpe and Stuart
Scott, as professors of football at Bristol University in
recognition of the cable network's headquarters in Bristol, Conn.
The spots, now in their third year, were originally created by
Wieden &AMP; Kennedy in Portland but are now produced by Lowe &AMP;
Partners/SMS in San Francisco, part of the Lowe Group unit of
Interpublic Group of Cos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want viewers to feel that if you go anywhere before the
game for insight, you should go to Bristol U.,'' said Lee Ann Daly,
ESPN's senior vice president for marketing and advertising. ``We
believe it reinforces our positioning that our pre-game show serves
the fan better than anyone else's.''
</P>
<P>
   In one spot, Berman and Jackson entice students to register for
classes like ``No-Huddle Offense 101'' and ``History of the Central
Division.''
</P>
<P>
   In a second, Jackson, a former Denver Broncos linebacker,
randomly tackles male and female students on campus in an attempt
to integrate real-life experiences into his teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that sports is entertainment and we have to
entertain and inform audiences,'' Ms. Daly said. `It's incumbent
upon us to serve things up in a way that differentiates us. The
programming differentiates us, but the spots differentiate us even
more.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN is using a second set of promotional ads, created by Wieden
&AMP; Kennedy, to drive viewers to its games. The network has brought
back a group of dogs, that, through the use of animation and
prosthetic limbs, speak and play poker. Rather than chatting only
to one another, as they did last season, the dogs converse with
people, including John (Big Dawg) Thompson, a rotund Cleveland
Browns fan who wears a hound dog mask, and players like Wayne
Chrebet of the Jets and Jason Sehorn of the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Performing the voice-overs are the actors Art Carney and Jeffrey
Tambor, the comedian Gilbert Gottfried and the retired basketball
star George Gervin. Carney's son came for an audition and said his
father wanted to try out. ``He said his father wanted him to tell
us, `I'm not dead yet!''' Ms. Daly said.
</P>
<P>
   CBS Sports was confronted with a different challenge, more
modest than reinforcing a successful program with familiar
personalities. Last season, when CBS returned to broadcasting pro
football after a four-year hiatus, its ``NFL Today'' studio program
was a creative failure. The sports division overhauled the show by
jettisoning three rookie analysts in favor of the more experienced
Randy Cross, Craig James and Jerry Glanville, but kept the host,
Jim Nantz.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Towey, the creative director of CBS Sports, said the goal
of a light-hearted series of promos, created in-house, was to
illustrate the group's interaction. ``I want the faces and
personalities to be upfront,'' Towey said. ``People have to know
our guys and that their interaction is different than it was last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   For one spot, set in a Brooklyn diner, a nosy waiter intrudes
into the announcers' fast-paced conversation about the forthcoming
season. Who is this guy? they ask. ```A big fan,'' Nantz says,
reintroducing a character played by actor Tony Hoty in spots for
the program from 1992 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Towey described the more lavish campaigns by Fox and ESPN as
``very extreme stuff with terrific execution,'' but added, ``We're
more focused on football. Our guys have fun but it's all about the
football.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC Sports no longer has a ``Monday Night Football'' pre-game
show _ a one-season experiment last year was an awkward muddle _
but is marketing the highly rated games by comparing the brawny
excitement of pro football with snatches of Monday night
entertainment in foreign countries, such as Irish clog dancing and
a Japanese variety show. ``Ain't America Great?'' the ads ask.

 &HT;    Shoe facts, gifts the right fit
 &HT;    EMBARGOED for Sunday, Sept. 19
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The Bata Shoe Museum has a great gift shop filled
with all kinds of shoe-related products. There are books _
including many versions of the Cinderella story _ as well as
stationery, jewelry, umbrellas and scarves.
</P>
<P>
   But if you can't get to Canada, some of those same products can
be found at The Museum Co. at the Mall at Fairfield Commons.
</P>
<P>
   A cute nightshirt sprinkled with images of shoes proclaims: ``If
the shoe fits, buy it in every color!'' It's $25 and one size fits
all. The store also carries ruby red slipper pins for $25 and $60
and guest soaps shaped like shoes for $8.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all started with the shoe book we carry,'' says Brad
Wiseman, store manager. ``People loved seeing the different shoes
throughout the ages.''
</P>
<P>
   The book he's referring to is ``Shoes: A Celebration of Pumps,
Sandals, Slippers &AMP; More'' by Linda O'Keeffe (Workman, $11.95),
with more than 1,000 photos.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum Co. also sells a line of miniature shoes called Just
the Right Size. Made by Willitts Designs, they range from a 1880
opera boot to a 1950 golden stiletto. There's also a ballet
slipper, a golf shoe and a cowboy boot. The little shoes (31 now in
the collection) are $15 to $25 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women of all ages are buying them,'' says Wiseman, ``and we've
had lots of mothers and daughters come in that collect them.''
Customers can register and receive notification as shoes are added
to the collection.
</P>
<P>
   Check bookstores for other shoe books, including these two
lavish art books:
</P>
<P>
   _ Valerie Steele's ``Shoes: A Lexicon of Style'' ( Rizzoli,
$40): Steele, chief curator of the museum at the Fashion Institute
of Technology in New York, insists, ``there is a bit of Imelda
Marcos in many women.'' Chapters are arranged by type of shoe:
court shoes and pumps, slippers and mules, stilettos, sandles, etc.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Shoes: Objects of Art and Seduction'' by Paola Buratto
Caovilla (Skira, $60)
</P>
<P>
   is creatively put together and covers topics ranging from the
history of shoes to shoemaking. Writes the author, wife of designer
Rene Fernando Caovilla, ``Not all shoes are made for walking, but
all can seduce.''
</P>
<P>
   FASCINATING FOOTNOTES
</P>
<P>
   _ Napoleon Bonaparte had servants walk around in his new boots
to break them in before he wore them.
</P>
<P>
   _ The average person walks the equivalent of 3 1/2 times around
the Earth in a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   _ People who are left-handed are also left-footed, having the
tendency to put their left foot forward first.
</P>
<P>
   _ The average person takes 9,000 steps a day.
</P>
<P>
   _ Women are four times more likely to develop foot trouble than
men.
</P>
<P>
   _ North Americans spend almost $18 billion a year on footwear.
</P>
<P>
   _ The average North American buys five pairs of shoes a year, as
do the English and Germans. The French tend to buy slightly more.
Italians, Spanish, Russian and Swedes manage with about 3 1/2 new
pairs each year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eight pairs of ruby slippers were made for Judy Garland to
wear in The Wizard of Oz; the last pair to be auctioned sold for
$165,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ The boots worn by Neil Armstrong for his walk on the moon in
1969 were jettisoned before returning to Earth to prevent
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   _ The original French version of the Cinderella story features a
fur slipper instead of a glass one. The confusion arose in the
similarity of a French word for white fur (vair), which resembled
the word for glass (verre).

 &HT;    Museum steps into world of shoes
 &HT;    EMBARGOED for Sunday, Sept. 19
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ I must admit I was expecting someone _ and something _
totally different.
</P>
<P>
   When I read that Sonja Bata's personal shoe collection was the
cornerstone for a new Toronto museum, I envisioned a fashionable
socialite with a shoe addiction and a couple of rooms in an old
house filled with shelves of her designer shoes.
</P>
<P>
   I figured I'd be there for about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine my surprise when I arrived at the busy corner of St.
George and Bloor streets and gazed at the contemporary five-story
limestone building designed to suggest a giant shoe box and lid.
Clever and enticing window displays ranged from giant feet with
appropriate quotes (''shoestring budget,'' ``fancy footwork''
``head over heels'') to a list of celebrity shoe sizes: Marilyn
Monroe (7AA), Fred Astaire (10 1/2), Robert Redford (9D) and
Shaquille O'Neal (22EEE).
</P>
<P>
   Inside North America's first shoe museum is the world's largest,
most comprehensive collection of shoes and shoe-related objects and
_ if you're lucky _ the woman who started it all.
</P>
<P>
   My one-hour visit turned into four hours.
</P>
<P>
   Sonja Bata believes that we obtain a glimpse of history by
looking at what people wear on their feet and that our footwear
tells a lot about each of us. She knows that shoes have been
adapted to suit the needs of different peoples _ and that through
them we are given clues to their environment, activities, social
position and traditions. And she is fascinated by all of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone steps out of their shoe, it doesn't become
lifeless, there's an imprint left of that person,'' insists Mrs.
Bata, ushering us to the office where she continues to work every
day as chairman of the Bata Shoe Museum Foundation. ``Shoes tell
you more than any other artifact.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the museum's 10,000 artifacts spanning 4,500 years are
Chinese silk shoes for binding women's feet, pre-Columbian
sacrificial boots, bear fur shoes for Japanese Samurai and human
hair slippers for Australian Aboriginal executioners.
</P>
<P>
   There are shoe-shaped ornamental artifacts (Majolica hand
warmers and inlaid fruitwood snuffboxes) and graphic materials
illustrating the history of footwear. There's also a display on the
age-old craft of shoemaking.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity footwear ranges from Queen Victoria's ballroom
slippers and Robert Redford's cowboy boots to Elton John's
monogrammed silver platform boots and Elvis Presley's blue patent
loafers. In a mini-theater, viewers watch news and film clips of
celebrities, at the end of each segment the spotlight shines on the
real shoe once worn by that celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors learn fascinating tidbits: evidence of shoemaking
exists as early as 10,000 B.C., one-quarter of all the bones in the
human body are found in the feet, the wedding custom of throwing
rice actually began with throwing shoes.
</P>
<P>
   I learned that Queen Elizabeth I popularized high heels and wore
them to make her diminutive stature more imposing and that
Salvatore Ferragamo and Vivienne Westwood weren't the first
designers to think of platforms: The museum has a velvet-covered
platform mule from 16th century Venice.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked if I could peek behind the scenes, I was taken on a
fascinating tour of storage rooms by conservator Ada Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until the 1800s there was no differentiation between the
left and right shoes,'' she told me, picking up a pair of shoes
from the 1620s to illustrate.
</P>
<P>
   An artifact sheet on every shoe in the collection includes
information ranging from a description of the shoe to its material,
measurements, date, owner, etc.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can also tell when someone had problems with their feet,''
she says. ``These Nikes were John McEnroe's. He had a bunion and
would slice the side of the shoes to relieve the pressure. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``And this is a horseshoe from Rising Star, who won the
Preakness.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the permanent exhibits, the museum hosts special
exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   A current retrospective features beautiful designer footwear
produced by Herbert Levine Inc. between 1948 and 1975. The Levines
_ Beth, the designer and Herbert, the marketing expert _ were known
for breaking the rules in their use of materials, fabric and
technology. For her wedding, Liza Minnelli requested red silk
wedding shoes reminiscent of those worn by her mother in The Wizard
of Oz. The Levines' kabuki shoe, a variation of the platforms worn
by Japanese stage actors, was an inspiration for the late Gianni
Versace. The company also has created paper shoes, pumps shaped
like racing cars and sandals with Astroturf insoles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japanese Footgear: Walking the Path of Innovation'' will be on
exhibit until January, showcasing traditional and occupational
footwear of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Bata's passion for shoes began many years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born in Switzerland, studied architecture and in 1946
got married to a shoe man,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   That ``shoe man'' wasn't exactly a cobbler; he was Thomas J.
Bata, son of a well-known Czech shoe manufacturer who had emigrated
to Canada at the beginning of World War II. Today, Bata is the
biggest shoe company in the world.
</P>
<P>
   When the company began introducing shoes to developing countries
around the world, Sonja Bata became involved, fascinated by the
various cultures and the shoes that reflected them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fascinated how different shoe shapes developed when feet
are all the same,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   Sonja Bata believes that shoes not only trace a path through
technological development but also mark even the subtlest shifts in
a society's attitudes and values. They illustrate social status,
climate, religion, sex, profession.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, when the collection had outgrown available private
storage space, the Bata family established its foundation to manage
the collection more professionally and to create a center of
knowledge about the role of footwear in social and cultural life.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation also publishes books and funds field trips to
collect and research footwear in areas where traditions are
changing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Bata is an advocate of specialized museums.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that museums were big state museums like the
Metropolitan in New York that have everything from armor to Fabrege
eggs,'' she says. ``Today we are more sophisticated, we want more
specialized information. And we want education and entertainment as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   She's convinced her museum will become a destination point for
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to leave our museum saying it was fun, that
they never realized shoes were so exciting and that this is the
whole world expressed in shoes!''
</P>

YATES GOES WITH A PROVEN WINNER

<TEXT>
<P>
   The last time Robert Yates made a driver change in one of his
cars, he went with a guy he figured he could teach how to win.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he's going with a guy who already knows.
</P>
<P>
   Without doubt, the combination of Yates and Ricky Rudd, a steady
veteran who has won at least one race for 16 straight seasons, will
be one of the most interesting combinations to watch in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd has agreed to a three-year deal with Yates, replacing Kenny
Irwin in Yates' primary car.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, who grew up in open-wheel competition, couldn't make the
transition from NASCAR's truck series to Winston Cup as quickly as
he needed to do with the high profile Yates car. With no real
background in stock cars, and no knowledge of what he needed to do
or what the car needed to do to win, Irwin, who is 30, struggled
with Yates for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as having a driver who knows his way around each and
every race track, it's so important, and it's something you don't
do overnight,'' Yates said. ``We knew that two years ago when we
hired Kenny. I think we've given a lot back to the sport for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've brought a guy to this arena that's going to be here for
a long time and do a good job,'' Yates said of Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   At 43, Rudd is at the opposite end of the pole. Rudd grew up in
stock cars.
</P>
<P>
   He has been running Winston Cup since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   He has experience in pressure situations, having driven for Rick
Hendrick and others in cars that were expected to do well.
</P>
<P>
   He has been on his own, running a team since 1994, and he has
experience in multi-car operations, having driven for Hendrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows how to win, and he knows how to win at every single
race track,'' Yates said. ``That's hard to come by these days, and
we're happy to have that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudd has high expectations for his first year with Yates. ``I
feel like a top five in the points is realistic for year one,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Kenny Irwin did a great job,'' Rudd said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can almost see myself ... in 1981 I drove for DiGard,
Gatorade. I wasn't ready for that ride,'' Rudd said. ``I was a
rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``They changed the size of the cars, they changed the wheel
base. I knew I wasn't ready for that ride, but I knew if I didn't
take it, that might be my last good opportunity,'' Rudd said. ``I
came out of there, and it helped me a lot. It prepared me for years
down the road, and I started winning shortly after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny Irwin is a great race car driver, and I think he'll be
great for some time,'' Rudd said. ``I think he's got a good future.
I think he'll do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudd and Yates will combine their operations, with the Yates car
operating out of the shop Rudd owns.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet certain how the two teams will merge, in terms of
personnel, and what will happen to the two crew chiefs, Doug
Richert with Yates and Michael McSwain with Rudd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, the toughest thing when you merge something, you've
got 100 people. I don't know how that's going to shake out,'' Yates
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yates could have a potent combination with Rudd in No. 28 teamed
with another veteran driver _ Dale Jarrett _ in Yates' second car,
No. 88.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there needs to be a bounce off of knowledge between
the two teams, and I would say the 88 has probably been feeding the
28 a lot of information. I think it's probably been a one-way flow,
maybe,'' Rudd said.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd noted that both he and Jarrett like the same kind of
chassis.

WITH GUNS, NO SAFE HAVEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 Editorial  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Something is terribly wrong with America when teen-agers being
fired upon at a Texas church thought that their pastor was ``trying
to play a joke on us'' in a scene ``out of a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Images of violence in the media are so pervasive that young
Americans have come to accept gun play as our cultural norm, even
in houses of worship.
</P>
<P>
   What happened Wednesday at Wedgwood Baptist Church in Fort Worth
was no joke, as victims and survivors now know. It was real. It was
horrible. And worse, it was familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Once again an armed gunman appeared calm as he mowed down
screaming children. There are frightening echoes of last April's
Columbine High School massacre in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, in August, gunman Buford O. Furrow's motive in a
killing at a Los Angeles area Jewish community center was hatred
against Jews and non-whites.
</P>
<P>
   The motive of the Fort Worth gunman, identified as Larry Gene
Ashbrook, was not known immediately. Seven people initially were
dead and others were wounded. Ashbrook fatally shot himself after a
spree in which he used a pipe bomb and 9mm semiautomatic and
.380-caliber handguns.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Worth, as in other cities known for their mass shootings
at schools, motive takes a back seat to means.
</P>
<P>
   The means in these cases were deadly firearms that were used
against unarmed people, including children.
</P>
<P>
   Too many guns are in too many hands.
</P>
<P>
   There will always be people who believe that they have a reason,
however irrational, to kill. But it is the access to firearms that
takes people beyond motive to criminality that can result in
multiple victims.
</P>
<P>
   The issue in Fort Worth, as elsewhere, is the proliferation of
firearms. This proliferation is what makes no place safe, not
child-care centers, not movie theaters, not schools, not workplaces
and not even places of worship.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is sacred so long as there are too many guns in too many
hands and too many lawmakers in Congress and the state legislatures
who want to keep things that way.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional lawmakers should look to Fort Worth as they keep
chipping at gun-reform measures _ such as those pertaining to
trigger locks and gun shows _ as part of the juvenile crime
package.
</P>
<P>
   So far all Congress has to show for gun control this session is
passage of a measure allowing schools to post the Ten Commandments.
This idea looks even more ludicrous in considering the shootings at
a church. The gunman was not stopped by Christian symbols.
</P>
<P>
   Too many guns in too many hands is the issue that the Texas
Legislature, which this year passed a bill protecting gun
manufacturers from lawsuits filed by local governments, needs to
consider. It was in Texas, by the way, that legislators this year
also did away with the prohibition of guns in churches.
</P>
<P>
   Only in America.

 &HT;    THORNY INTERNET POLITICS ISSUES DEBATED IN REAL TIME
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``This is the future,'' Sen. Bob Bennett, R-Utah,
proclaimed Thursday as an Internet site devoted to political issues
fed a blurry image the size of a postage stamp to computer
monitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``First,'' Bennett said, his nearly bald head bobbing slowly in
the video frame, ``we had door-to-door campaigning. Then we had
newspapers, followed by television and by cable. And now we have
the Internet. This is where political campaigns are going.''
</P>
<P>
   The unique four-hour webcast, titled ``the Frontier of Internet
Politics,'' brought together political leaders and cyberspace gurus
to ponder such issues as ``the 2000 Campaign and the Future of
E-Politics.''
</P>
<P>
   But the technical limits posed by the streaming video were
hardly as daunting as public policy challenges posed by the
increasingly popular online medium.
</P>
<P>
   The political panelists who followed Bennett's upbeat
introductory remarks gave equally glowing reports on the coming
promise of grass-roots democracy, reduced dependence on traditional
media, lower campaign costs and even widespread Internet voting.
</P>
<P>
   However, the moderator of the ``2000 campaign'' forum, Albert
Gidari, warned that the Internet ``poses a clear threat to
traditional political party structures.'' Gidari heads Savvy.com, a
high-tech consulting firm to online firms.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the forum left the most vital issue of all _ how to
regulate, if at all, political activity on the Internet _
unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the issue briefly took center stage in
Congress when Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the third-ranking Republican
in the House and an ardent foe of tighter campaign finance laws,
proposed that the Internet be preserved as a political free-fire
zone. DeLay's proposal was promptly branded as a ``poison pill''
aimed at splintering support for reform.
</P>
<P>
   At least for the moment, DeLay's gambit put him in the same camp
as James Dempsey of the Center for Democracy and Technology, a
liberal-leaning Washington-based advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is uniquely decentralized, global, abundant,
inexpensive, interactive and user-controlled. The campaign finance
laws were developed for the centralized, scarce, and expensive
media of radio, television and print,'' Dempsey said in the
webcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initial efforts to apply the Federal Election Campaign Act to
these new and varied Internet communications have yielded troubling
results, threatening to burden _ even silence _ the voice of
average citizens in American political life.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Dempsey spoke, his center was issuing a fresh report on
the issue which concluded: ``It would be worse than ironic if rules
designed to de-emphasize the unfair advantage of money, to broaden
the diversity of groups that can have an impact on the election
process and to 'return our electoral process to the people' were
applied to deter individuals from using the 'electronic soapbox' of
the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, warned David Mason, a Republican who was nominated
to the Federal Election Commission by President Clinton last year.
While agreeing with much of the thrust of Dempsey's argument, Mason
noted that ``as an enforcement agency, we have a problem. We have
the law (to uphold) out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Mason: ``If your proposals are adopted, we're going to
handicap political parties on the very media that you're saying we
ought to be promoting as a grass-roots force in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``That raises some real questions about equity and about equal
protection under the laws. So my view is that you're either going
to be stuck with a completely deregulatory approach or you're going
to be stuck with a regulatory agency making some very difficult
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more skeptical comments came from Fred Wertheimer,
president of Democracy 21 and former head of Common Cause, a
government watchdog group aligned with liberal causes.
</P>
<P>
   Wertheimer raised the possibility that Internet exemptions could
allow a president to blithely take bribes so long as all of the
transactions were confined to cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would caution very strongly that the simple way out is to
say, why don't we just exempt the Internet from campaign finance
laws,'' he said. ``But the purpose of existing laws is to protect
the public from corruption. I don't think we can simply accept the
idea that since regulation sounds like a bad idea on the Internet
we will give up on the notion of protecting citizens against
corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   The live political webcast was sponsored by D.C. Orbit Network
(www.dcorbit.com). The Washington-based group serves as a
clearinghouse for 16 non-partisan political and public affairs web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   The report released Thursday by the Center for Democracy and
Technology, titled ``Square Pegs and Round Holes,'' may be found on
the group's web site, www.cdt.org.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The biggest domino has been knocked down, and the rest of the
line will fall, too.
</P>
<P>
   When Robert Yates signed Ricky Rudd to a three-year contract as
the replacement for Kenny Irwin, the best available ride for next
year on the Winston Cup circuit was gone.
</P>
<P>
   And that means other drivers searching for jobs _ but perhaps
hesitant to commit elsewhere while the Yates car was still open _
will now take what they can get.
</P>
<P>
   The best seat open now is the Chevy unexpectedly vacated by Ken
Schrader, who left to replace Ernie Irvan in Read Morton's Pontiac.
Morton's car is popularly regarded as Hendrick Motorsports' test
Pontiac. It gets its engines from Hendrick and has other ties to
that team as well.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader's former car, owned by Andy Petree, has potential.
Petree, Richard Childress and Dale Earnhardt are all tied together
through a research and development group jointly funded by all
three teams. Petree's car would seem to be the new prize, but there
might be problems here.
</P>
<P>
   Some wonder if the loss of Schrader will also mean the loss of
Petree's new sponsor, Oakwood Homes. Schrader is the one who
brought Oakwood Homes to Petree and some think with Schrader now
gone, Oakwood Hhomes might be, too.
</P>
<P>
   Petree denies this.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're firmly committed,'' Petree said, ``but we've got to
put a good driver in the car. Their expectations are of having
Schrader or someone equal to him. They're doing their part and
we've got to do ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Petree was furious when Schrader told him he was leaving,
because the two had just agreed on an extension of Schrader's
contract, although Schrader hadn't signed it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Petree needs to get a driver acceptable to Oakwood Homes.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nemechek could figure here. Nemechek was Yates' alternate
choice to replace Irwin if Rudd was unavailable. He has qualities
Petree is looking for.
</P>
<P>
   First, he represents a sponsor well. And second, he has a strong
knowledge of cars and what has to be done to make them go fast.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other candidates out there are Irwin and Wally
Dallenbach, but word is that Irwin has already signed with Sabco to
replace Nemechek, although that won't be announced until the final
race in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Dallenbach, meanwhile, may be headed to Cal Wells' new team,
which took Rudd's sponsor, Tide, to start the ball rolling.

   The New York Times News Service plans a lead story and two pages
of inside coverage on Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   HURRICANE-RDP (Wilmington, N.C.) _ Hurricane Floyd comes ashore
near Cape Fear, N.C., with 110 mph winds, flooding the Carolina
coasts with more than a foot of rain as tens of thousands of people
huddled in shelters. At least seven deaths are blamed on the storm.
More than 480,000 people in the Carolinas and Virginia have lost
power. In Portsmouth, Va., flooding and power failures combined to
shut down the water supply system, which serves 110,000 customers.
By Francis X. Clines.

</P>
<P>
   HURRICANE-NY (New York) _ Hurricane Floyd brought its fierce
winds and torrents of rain to a New York region that was waiting
and well prepared, flooding roads and knocking out some power but
failing to inflict any devastating damage. By David W. Chen.
</P>
<P>
   HURRICANE-NY-SCENE (New York) _ To a large extent, the city hid.
It wasn't always clear from what. Sure, Hurricane Floyd was
supposed to roar into town Thursday and topple buildings and
catapult buses over the World Trade Center _ but where was it? The
day the hurricane was due was very much a day of pointed contrasts
in the metropolitan area, with portions of the area being pounded,
while the city itself was tricked by a non-event. By N.R.
Kleinfeld.
</P>
<P>
   HURRICANE-OBSESS (Undated) _ From North Dakota to London, and
certainly from New Jersey through the five boroughs and around to
New England, Floyd fixated millions of people Thursday, staring at
some from television screens with its Cyclopian eye etched in
synthetic orange swirls and blasting others right in the face with
potent rainy gusts. By Andrew C. Revkin.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; FEATURE story &LR;
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN-POP-MUSIC (Undated) _ During ``Not Lookin,''' a new duet
with her former beau, the urban love man K-Ci Hailey, Mary J. Blige
demonstrates how to stop a man cold. The song, from Ms. Blige's new
album, ``Mary,'' pits a woman seeking true affection against a man
out for pure pleasure. Throughout the 1990s, most discussions of
women's increased power in pop have focused on alternative-rock
transgressors like Tori Amos and Courtney Love or the songbirds of
Sarah McLachlan's Lilith Fair. Rhythm-and-blues artists sold albums
but were rarely viewed as culture shapers. Now, though, with
mainstream rock again becoming a male bastion, it is clear whose
music matters within the continuing emergence of women as equal
players in contemporary music. By Ann Powers. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   SATURDAY-NIGHT-LIVE (Undated) _ Nothing in popular culture can
be hip for 25 years. The culture turns over far too many times.
Icons become relics; objects of obsession become objects of
nostalgia. So what are we to make of ``Saturday Night Live''? The
one-time groundbreaking, precedent-setting, establishment-tweaking
comedy sketch show begins a decidedly well-established 25th season
on NBC next week, to be celebrated by a two-and-a-half-hour
prime-time special next Sunday night. Longevity is certainly not in
itself a claim on pop cultural relevance. Other shows have been on
longer but are in no danger of being labeled hip (e.g., ``The Price
Is Right''). But, apparently in defiance of both time and show
business convention, ``SNL'' begins a 25th year still the most
pervasive influence on the art of comedy in contemporary culture.
By Bill Carter. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CALIGULA-FILM (Undated) _ This month, the re-release of a movie
that became infamous in 1980 for going too far will go even further
_ about 12 minutes further, according to its producer, Bob Guccione
of Penthouse magazine. ``Caligula,'' called by Newsweek ``a
two-and-one-half hour cavalcade of depravity,'' will now run nearly
two-and-three-quarters hours. The movie opened Friday in New York.
By Ted Loos. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   JAKOB-THE-LIAR-FILM (Paris) _ ``Jakob the Liar,'' directed by
Peter Kassovitz and starring Robin Williams as the reluctant hero
Jakob Heym, opens in New York on Friday. The film, based on a 1969
novel by Jurek Becker, tells of a Jewish cafe owner who uses lies
to bring hope to a Polish wartime ghetto. By Alan Riding. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SHABBY-BLACK-DANCE (New York) _ ``I'm supposed to look like a
disheveled, disgruntled old geisha,'' Beverly Blossom said
cheerfully, dressed in a long golden kimono and top hat and
sprawled in a convenient folding chair in a midtown rehearsal
studio. Next she swept across the floor in a bargain-basement black
satin Balenciaga cloak and thrift-shop gold dress, a toy monkey
drooping from her hand. Then, with the donning of another, slightly
shredded costume, she became both an aging beauty and a
bottom-patting old gigolo drawn together in a bittersweet tango.
``Who (italics)is(end italics) she?'' a visitor to the studio
whispered, eyes wide, as Ms. Blossom glided through the dizzying
array of characters she will portray in ``Dances in Shabby Black,''
a retrospective program on Friday and Saturday at the Context
Studio, a small black-box theater on the Lower East Side. By
Jennifer Dunning. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   DOWNSIZING-MUSICALS (subslug) (New York) _ The dancing corkscrew
will still be there, as will the singing whisk and the graceful
cheese grater. But there may be slightly fewer spinning plates and
spatulas when ``Beauty and the Beast'' reopens at the Lunt-Fontanne
Theater on Nov. 12. By Robin Pogrebin. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   OHNESORG-MUSIC (Cologne, Germany) _ Franz Xaver Ohnesorg, 51, a
Bavarian, who has held various administrative position in Munich,
will become the executive and artistic director of Carnegie Hall.
By James R. Oestreich. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NINE-INCH-NAILS-ALBUM (New York) _ Trent Reznor can smile now.
``Everyone has this impression of me that I'm morose,'' he
complained. An interviewer pointed out that the albums he had made
as Nine Inch Nails were saturated in despair. ``Point taken,'' he
said. Reznor was caffeinated and voluble as he sat in a midtown
hotel room where he was doing interviews, sipping what was clearly
not his first cup of coffee and explaining how five years went by
between ``The Downward Spiral'' and Nine Inch Nails' new album,
``The Fragile.'' By Jon Pareles. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   REZNOR-ROCK-MUSIC (Undated) _ Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails
has lost interest in easy sensationalism and standard taboos in his
music, and he's no longer fighting psychological battles with
authority figures. Instead, he has decided to stare down his most
relentless tormentor: himself. By Jon Pareles. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   UN-PRIVATE-HOUSE-ART (New York) _ Modern life is long, modern
art is short. That's why art keeps getting better all the time. If
you don't like it now, just stick around for a while. Eventually,
something likable is bound to turn up. It's a pleasure to report,
for example, that the Museum of Modern Art's architecture and
design department is back on track after several lackluster
seasons. ``The Un-Private House,'' a current show has been a
popular as well as a critical success. The exhibition of 26 recent
residential designs will run through Oct. By Herbert Muschamp.

JAPANESE REGULATORS GET A SECOND `SCALP' UNDER THEIR BELTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ It was a signature that caught the eye of an
investigator sifting through documents in the Tokyo office of
Cresvale International, the Hong Kong-based brokerage firm that
sold what were apparently fraudulent investments to a wide range of
Japanese corporate investors.
</P>
<P>
   Why, he wondered, was the head of futures trading at Republic
New York Securities, a unit of the Republic New York Corp., signing
a routine letter from the back office confirming the status of a
client's account? ``It didn't make sense,'' said Kiyotaka Sasaki,
who is in charge of inspections of international financial
institutions at the Financial Supervisory Agency, Japan's financial
watchdog. ``It showed a lack of controls.''
</P>
<P>
   That question ultimately led to the arrest in the United States
on Monday of Martin A. Armstrong, a show-boating investment manager
who was well known among Japanese corporate investors for his
persuasive sales pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, 49, has been accused by U.S. prosecutors of
defrauding Japanese investors of hundreds of millions of dollars.
Two Republic New York Securities officials, William H. Rogers, the
futures trading head, and James Sweeney, the unit's chief
executive, have been suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Through his lawyer, Armstrong has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   But the sleuthing that uncovered the purported fraud is likely
to help burnish the reputation of Japan's fledgling financial
regulators, who began operations a little more than a year ago and
have struggled under severe financial and personnel constraints,
considering the size and complexity of the markets and institutions
they are charged with policing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some concern about morale here,'' Sasaki said. ``We
have few resources and lots of challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's arrest is the second ``scalp'' the inspection
department has collected this summer, coming roughly two months
after regulators revoked the license of Credit Suisse First
Boston's derivatives unit and imposed sanctions on the Swiss firm's
other operations here for their role in helping Japanese
corporations and financial institutions mask their huge losses.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, what many have assumed was dumb luck on the part of the
investigators from the Financial Supervisory Agency was at least in
part a matter of weaving together bits of information gleaned in
previous forays into the operations of other financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators used information they uncovered during their
audit of Credit Suisse First Boston and decided to take a look at
Cresvale. They suspected that the brokerage firm, which was owned
by Armstrong's Princeton Economics International Ltd., had sold
similar financial instruments.
</P>
<P>
   What they found were a group of notes, known collectively as the
Princeton notes, issued by an offshore investment company based in
the Turks and Caicos Islands that did not fall under the purview of
any financial regulator. The proceeds from the sale of those notes
and the interest they generated were supposedly held in segregated
accounts at Republic New York Securities, but the Japanese
regulators suspected that accounts were in fact commingled to mask
losses.
</P>
<P>
   Their suspicions no doubt were a result of the environment in
which most of them grew up: the old, vague, opaque regulatory
system administered by bureaucrats at the Ministry of Finance who
were particularly sensitive to the strict maintenance of
``firewalls'' and boundaries between financial businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the companies that were purportedly defrauded by
Armstrong largely seemed to be in the dark until last week, when
newspapers here began reporting that the agency had contacted U.S.
regulators with questions about Princeton that ultimately led to
Armstrong's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Junsei Atarashi, a spokesman for the Yakult Honsha Co., which
stands to lose several billion yen from its investment in Princeton
notes, said Yakult started scrambling to collect information in
May, after news broke of the investigation into Cresvale. ``The
people in charge of investments here bought these notes because
they earned a good interest rate,'' he said. ``We never imagined
they were going to become trash.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Amada Co. and two of its affiliates could lose a total of 13
billion yen, or $125 million at current exchange rates. ``We
received an explanation at the time we bought these notes that the
principal was secured and the accounts were separately maintained
by Republic,'' said Koshichi Kikuchi, Amada's head of accounting.
``Now we are finding out that the accounts were not separately
maintained and the principal was not secured, so I can't avoid
saying that we were cheated.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the 10 percent return that Amada had made on a previous
investment in Princeton notes that enticed it into buying another
set of notes this spring, Kikuchi said. Kikuchi and other company
officials denied that notes were purchased to hide losses, but
regulators suspect otherwise and the Japanese Securities and
Exchange Commission is conducting a separate investigation into
corporations that have purchased Princeton notes.
</P>
<P>
   Far from feeling sorry for the investors, many Japanese regard
them as foolish, and in fact, Armstrong apparently did not try to
sell Princeton notes to investors in any other country. ``This
shows a weakness in risk management on the part of Japanese
investors,'' one regulator said.

SURGEON GENERAL ASSAILS `EASY ASSESS TO FIREARMS'

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ As one would expect of America's family doctor, U.S.
Surgeon General David Satcher encouraged everyone to exercise 30
minutes a day and eat more fruits and veggies.
</P>
<P>
   But Satcher took on tougher topics as well during his Thursday
morning address to more than 1,000 health care professionals in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   He assailed the country's ``easy access to firearms'' and
``glamorization of violence'' which ``certainly played a part'' in
Wednesday's Fort Worth shooting spree and suicide that left eight
people dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1996, in Japan, there were 15 children who died from
firearms. In England, there were 30. In Canada, there were 105. In
the United States, there were 5,000,'' he said. ``There's something
wrong with that picture.''
</P>
<P>
   He criticized complacency regarding AIDS. ``We have made some
progress, (but) it's not real progress in my opinion,'' he said,
because the rate of new infections in the United States has not
decreased.
</P>
<P>
   He called for universal access to health care and the
elimination of disparities in overall health across ethnic lines,
citing dramatic differences in American life expectancies. Average
life expectancy in the U.S. is now 76.5 years, he said. For white
women, it's 80. For black women, it's about 74. For white men, 73.
For black men, 67.2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the uninsured, the underserved, the underrepresented _
but let me tell you, that's not the whole story. We also have the
uninspired,'' he said. ``Three thousand teen-agers become smokers
every day. Explain that to me. Why do people use drugs and inject
dirty needles and get the AIDS virus? What is it going to take to
turn that around? We've got to find a way to reach the uninspired
and uninformed.''
</P>
<P>
   Satcher's appearance at the Edwin Hornberger Conference Center
in the Texas Medical Center kicked off a planned series of
educational seminars put on by the City of Houston Health and Human
Services Department for employees and other medical and public
health professionals.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Afterward, he toured the new Houston Community College System
Health Science Center, the city's La Nueva Casa health clinic and a
mobile HIV testing unit.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Satcher, a highly respected doctor and educator, who until
recently headed the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, was appointed surgeon general and assistant secretary
of health last year. The position was vacant for three years after
the controversial Dr. Joycelyn Elders was fired in 1994 for making
what many considered inappropriate public remarks about
masturbation
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office, Satcher's causes have included suicide
prevention, placing health warnings on cigars and reducing the
waistlines of America's overweight population.
</P>
<P>
   The physician's remarks were preceded by a presentation from
Stephen Klineberg, a Rice University sociologist who has conducted
an annual survey of Houston's attitudes and concerns for 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   Klineberg provided the backdrop to the health care discussion by
outlining Houston's shifting economy and racial makeup. Houston now
has a majority-minority population with a composition that is
roughly one-third white, one-third Hispanic and one-third blacks
and Asians combined.
</P>
<P>
   He said Houstonians are embracing the city's diversity to a
greater degree than ever before. But within that diversity are
gaping differences in education levels among immigrants: 57 percent
of Asian immigrants have college degrees; 54 percent of Mexican
immigrants do not have high school diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   Without a college degree ``you are condemned to poverty. You
will make minimum wage the rest of your life,'' Klineberg said.
``This is not a vigorous blue-collar economy. Education is the
critical determinant.''
</P>
<P>
   Satcher called for a closing of gaps between the races in terms
of good health and emphasized that quality of life is as important
as longevity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not just concerned about when they're going to die.
They're concerned about how they're going to live,'' he said.
``They are concerned about how they feel when they get up in the
morning, how they feel when they go to bed at night. Whether or not
they're enjoying sex. Quality of life is a major goal... Not just,
can we get people to live longer (but) can we get them to live
better.''

RUSSIANS BEGIN TO DOUBT GOVERNMENT AS BLASTS CONTINUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As the death toll rose in Thursday's apartment bombing
in southern Russia, President Boris N. Yeltsin sought to dispel
fears that his government is powerless to halt the deadly
explosions sweeping the country,
</P>
<P>
   But with each passing day, Russians have less faith that the
state can protect them. The blast that ripped through a large
apartment building in the southern city of Volgodonsk early
Thursday killed at least 17 residents and wounded 180, 20 of them
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion, which investigators called a terrorist act, was
the fourth deadly apartment blast this month, a wave of violence
that has claimed close to 300 lives and further eroded what little
credibility Russian authorities still enjoy among their citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The authorities have enough will and enough resources for the
struggle against terrorism,'' Yeltsin said in a telegram to the
governor of Rostov region, where Volgodonsk is located.
</P>
<P>
   But as the country once again tuned into to the grosteque
footage of rescue workers searching the ruins for survivors, few
here shared in their president's confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians lashed out at law enforcement agencies' lack of
preparedness. Analysts predicted more violence. Yeltsin, his
presidency already reeling from an international money laundering
scandal, charges of Kremlin corruption and a bloody insurgency in
the Caucasus, seemed weaker and more isolated than he has ever been
during his 8-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important for the residents of tens of thousands of
apartment buildings across Russia is that they have seen the
weakness of a state that only a decade ago ran one of the most
tightly monitored and oppressive societies in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now know that we are alone, that no one can protect us,''
said Tamara Chernyshova, a television producer who lives in a
Moscow high-rise with her husband and two small children.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's blast was the fifth deadly explosion in Russia since
Aug. 31, when a bomb detonated in a central Moscow mall, killing
one person and injuring 40. Early this month, an apartment building
in the southern Russian region of Dagestan that housed military
officers and their families was rocked by a blast that killed 64.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a blast ripped through an apartment building in the
southeast Moscow residential neighborhood of Pechatniki, killing
93, and on Monday a bomb levelled a similar apartment complex on
Kashirskoye Highway in southern Moscow, killing 118.
</P>
<P>
   Police have responded with a massive citywide operation called
``Whirlwind,'' which they say has uncovered several tons of
explosives and possibly prevented as many as six more blasts.
</P>
<P>
   Russian investigators say they also have figured out how the
perpetrators had managed to sneak tons of explosives into Moscow
without being detected by disguising it as bags of sugar.
</P>
<P>
   But Moscow police spokesman Kirill Mazurin also said he could
not rule out a new attack in the Russian capital.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the death toll in Thursday's explosion in Volgodonsk
might have been much worse if not for their efforts to clear out
basements and attics. The explosives this time were hidden in a
truck or in an underground pipe outside the nine-story building.
The powerful blast, the equivalent of 600 to 1,000 pounds of
dynamite, demolished the front of the complex and damaged 20
surrounding buildings and formed a crater 12 feet deep and 40 feet
wide. As with all the apartment blasts, the explosion went off at a
time when people were asleep at home, meaning that the as yet
unknown attackers were trying to cause maximum casualities.
</P>
<P>
   No one immediately claimed responsbility, but officials
immediately fingered the people they blame for the other blasts,
insurgents from the breakaway Caucasus region of Chechnya who have
been fighting the Russian army in the neighboring southern Russian
region of Dagestan. The Chechens deny responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, speaking on Russian TV after a
meeting in which he ordered his cabinet to improve security across
the nation, appealed to citizens to look after themselves. ``I want
to turn to military veterans, police veterans. Take the initiative
on yourselves,'' Putin said.
</P>
<P>
   Many people across Moscow are way ahead of him. Frightened
residents have been organizing patrols and other actions to protect
themselves and their homes since Monday's blast.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition politicians, meanwhile, derided the Kremlin's
security drive as too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said that Thursday's
blast demonstrated ``the paralysis of the entire law enforcement
system in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts place the blame on the lack of funding for the
post-Soviet security agencies, resulting in huge cuts in
intelligence and counter-terrorism forces. That is part of the
problem, but it is also true that the successors of the Soviet KGB,
which concentrated on protecting Communist rule and fighting the
Cold War with the West, never truly developed a force effective at
battling terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Russian counter-terrorism techniques place a priority on shows
of force, such as paratroopers on bridges and tanks on roads
leading into the city, rather than the development of intelligence
that can help head off attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians charge that Yeltsin has stood pat even after
rebel commandos staged successful surprise raids on Russian cities
during the 1994-1996 civil war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all these terrorist acts, the state has not take any
action,'' said , Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov leader of an
anti-Kremlin coalition and a likely candidate in presidential
elections scheduled for next year.
</P>
<P>
   The elections, plus a parliamentary vote set for December, have
been the subject of numerous rumors. One popular Moscow newspaper
with close ties to Luzhkov, Moskovsky Komsomolets, has been
alleging for days that the Kremlin, or someone behind those in
power, has been setting off the bombs themselves to create an
excuse for declaring a state of emergency and cancelling elections.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Kremlin and Russia's Federal Security Service, the main
successor to the former KGB, Thursday angrily denied the
allegations. Other rumors swirling in the capital have predicted
that Yeltsin would soon replace Putin, or that the embattled
president himself was preparing to step down.
</P>
<P>
   Such a rumor, which would have gripped the country just a few
years ago, is now a side-issue for Russians worried about whether
or not they will wake up the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can Russia, shaken by a vicious attack, find normal,
forward-looking leaders and strategists for itself? For the time
being, this is not certain,'' asked the Noviye Ivestiya newspaper
this week. ``But what is clear is that the existence of each one of
us depends on this.''

   HURRICANE-RDP (Wilmington, N.C.) _ Hurricane Floyd comes ashore
near Cape Fear, N.C., with 110 mph winds, flooding the Carolina
coasts with more than a foot of rain as tens of thousands of people
huddled in shelters. At least seven deaths are blamed on the storm.
More than 480,000 people in the Carolinas and Virginia have lost

   CONTAMINATED-FOOD (Washington) _ While the United States has one
of the safest food supplies in the world, about 76 million
Americans suffer food-poisoning each year and about 5,000 die from
it, the federal government said Thursday. The Centers for Disease

QUAYLE BEGINS GO-FOR-BROKE N.H. EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ Frustrated, but resolved to remain in the
Republican presidential primary, Dan Quayle is pinning all of his
hopes on New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   His not-so-secret strategy: ``Camp out here.'' Quayle has even
begun leaving clothes at former Governor John H. Sununu's home in
Salem, where he has practically taken up residence.
</P>
<P>
   With his disappointing eighth place showing in August's Iowa
straw poll and recent surveys putting his support at just 4 percent
here, the former vice president has been running short on money and
battling rapidly diminishing expectations. His best hope, he
believes, is to concentrate his campaign on the first-primary
state, at the expense of Iowa and other areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to pick the state where you have the best opportunity
to get some momentum and have the media recognize it,'' Quayle said
Thursday. ``The media's still concentrated on the East Coast. It's
easy to get to New Hampshire, they pay a lot more attention to the
New Hampshire primary than the Iowa caucuses.''
</P>
<P>
   If he can get that media attention, Quayle is hoping voters will
come to see him as the conservative alternative to George W. Bush,
the Texas governor with the Texas-size warchest.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle has plenty of company on the conservative side of the GOP
field. But he sees himself as the only one among them with a claim
to electability. Religious conservative Gary Bauer, he believes, is
not going to make the cut, and neither is billionaire publisher
Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can write the biggest check he wants,'' Quayle said of
Forbes. ``But the Republican nominee is going to be somebody that's
been elected to office before. It's going to be a governor, it's
going to be a former vice president or it's going to be a senator.
That's the way it works. This is not an entry level job, it's a job
that requires some experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his years as a congressman, senator and vice president,
Quayle confesses to feeling discouraged by the amount of money Bush
has raised -- calling it ``staggering and unprecedented'' -- and by
the inordinate amount of attention Bush receives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I confess readily that I am frustrated with this whole
inevitability coronation factor,'' Quayle said, in a message he
repeated in a talk to Bedford business leaders and in appearances
on two radio talk shows. ``I think it's wrong, I think it's a
mistake. I think it's a miscalculation.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bedford, at the New England Council's Politics and Eggs
breakfast, Quayle vented his frustration at the Republican Party
establishment and its willingness to embrace Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``A campaign without ideas is no campaign at all,'' Quayle said.
``It seems the hierarchy in the party is interested in just winning
rather than discussing ideas that provide for winning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican party, he said, needs a wake-up call. Quayle said
he identifies with the unhappiness expressed by New Hampshire
Senator Bob Smith, who recently left the Republican party to become
an independent, and the commentator Patrick J. Buchanan, who's
thinking about leaving the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something very fundamental going on in our party and
in America,'' Quayle said. ``If there are no real differences
(between the parties), then people say, `What difference does it
make?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle described himself as a reformer, touting term limits and
the simplification of the tax code. He would also require losing
litigants to pay legal fees when a judge deems a lawsuit to be
frivolous. Quayle also said the health care system must be changed
in order to put doctors back in charge of patients' medical care,
rather than ``health insurance bureaucrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he is frequently identified as a social conservative, and
he often speaks to anti-abortion activists at pregnancy crisis
centers, Quayle did not discuss abortion or prayer in schools
during his appearances Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   And despite his aggravation at the Bush money and momentum, he
appeared to be having fun as he signed autographs throughout the
day and answered scores of questions.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters, who were passing out Quayle stickers in Bedford,
were enthusiastic, too.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Griffin, a state representative from Windham, was adamant:
``Is there anybody else? I like everything he stands for and he's
morally strong,'' she said.

NBC TO BUY ONE-THIRD OF PAXSON COMMUNICATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NBC, left on the sidelines while CBS merged with Viacom last
week, has moved to extend its own reach and enlarge its audience by
announcing plans to buy a one-third stake in Paxson Communications
Corp., owner of Pax TV.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by the Federal Communications Commission, the
agreement will broaden NBC's national distribution system to
include more than 120 stations either owned by Paxson
Communications or affiliated with Pax TV.
</P>
<P>
   The deal rekindled concerns about media consolidation in fewer
and fewer hands _ a trend US Representative Edward Markey (D-Mass.)
has called ``communications cannibalism.'' Mark Crispin Miller, a
media professor at New York University, said the NBC/Pax agreement
is another step toward making ``independent voices on TV a thing of
the past.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As with Viacom, so here,'' he said. ``It reinforces the
control of a few over a range of outlets that should belong to the
many.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 Telecommunications Act prohibits a major broadcast
network from owning another. However, analysts said the NBC/Pax
deal may pass muster with the FCC because the commission may
consider Pax a station group rather than a network under its
guidelines. An FCC spokesman did not return calls. Under the terms
of the $415 million deal, NBC can take full operating control of
Paxson Communications in three years, also subject to FCC approval.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger-is-better mania has overtaken the television industry
as networks scramble to develop multiple revenue streams to compete
with cable. That scramble has intensified since the FCC last month
lifted the prohibition against companies' owning more than one
station in the same TV market.
</P>
<P>
   A key question left unanswered by the NBC/Pax deal was its
impact on NBC's 220 local affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   During a news conference, NBC president Bob Wright made clear
that he sees only an upside for the network itself as he proclaimed
that the deal will give NBC a ``long-sought second outlet for our
entertainment programming.'' In Boston, that could mean viewers
will eventually be able to watch NBC programs not just on Channel 7
but also on local Pax station Channel 68.
</P>
<P>
   It is extremely unlikely that NBC would ever air first-run
programs on Channel 68 rather than Channel 7. A more plausible
scenario is that the network would use the smaller station to
broadcast reruns of miniseries, made-for-TV movies, entertainment
specials, sports events, and perhaps sitcoms and dramas _ all of
which could cut into Channel 7's audience.
</P>
<P>
   NBC, the network that coined the slogan ``Must-See TV,'' might
reduce the sense of urgency viewers feel about exactly when they
``must see'' an NBC program if there is a second channel on which
to watch the same program a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't hurt NBC, but it potentially hurts the
affiliates,'' said Michael Goodman, senior analyst at the Yankee
Group. Paul R. Krumins, a TV industry consultant who heads Copley
Entertainment, disagreed that it will cut into affiliates' audience
share but said it does increase NBC's leverage in dealing with its
affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that NBC will use Pax stations as another outlet
for news programs produced by MSNBC or CNBC, the cable channels
already eating into the audience of NBC affiliates. That could also
spell trouble for affiliates, for whom every viewer counts because
revenues are directly tied to audience levels.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Carson, general manager of Channel 7, said the
Boston station doesn't ``feel threatened'' by the NBC/Pax deal,
though he acknowledged that the audience for affiliates is
``diluted'' when viewers ``can see the same things more than once''
on other channels.
</P>
<P>
   NBC affiliates are currently in talks with the network over
``exclusivity'' arrangements that address that issue. During a
conference call among affiliate executives Thursday afternoon,
Wright joined in to discuss the Pax deal.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between NBC and its affiliates have grown testy over
issues of compensation, but Carson dismissed any speculation that
the network would ever turn to the Pax stations as its primary
delivery system. ``The reality is that the Pax stations are a bunch
of second- and third-tier UHF stations,'' he said. ``As an outlet
for programming, it would be a disaster for NBC to switch their
whole signal to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBC/Pax deal represents a triumph for Lowell W. ``Bud''
Paxson, chairman of Paxson Communications, who founded Pax TV just
one year ago as a ``family entertainment network.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Globe, Paxson
</P>
<P>
   conceded that NBC ``can do whatever they like when they own
it.''

NBC TO BUY ONE-THIRD OF PAXSON COMMUNICATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NBC, left on the sidelines while CBS merged with Viacom last
week, has moved to extend its own reach and enlarge its audience by
announcing plans to buy a one-third stake in Paxson Communications
Corp., owner of Pax TV.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by the Federal Communications Commission, the
agreement will broaden NBC's national distribution system to
include more than 120 stations either owned by Paxson
Communications or affiliated with Pax TV.
</P>
<P>
   The deal rekindled concerns about media consolidation in fewer
and fewer hands _ a trend US Representative Edward Markey (D-Mass.)
has called ``communications cannibalism.'' Mark Crispin Miller, a
media professor at New York University, said the NBC/Pax agreement
is another step toward making ``independent voices on TV a thing of
the past.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As with Viacom, so here,'' he said. ``It reinforces the
control of a few over a range of outlets that should belong to the
many.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 Telecommunications Act prohibits a major broadcast
network from owning another. However, analysts said the NBC/Pax
deal may pass muster with the FCC because the commission may
consider Pax a station group rather than a network under its
guidelines. An FCC spokesman did not return calls. Under the terms
of the $415 million deal, NBC can take full operating control of
Paxson Communications in three years, also subject to FCC approval.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger-is-better mania has overtaken the television industry
as networks scramble to develop multiple revenue streams to compete
with cable. That scramble has intensified since the FCC last month
lifted the prohibition against companies' owning more than one
station in the same TV market.
</P>
<P>
   A key question left unanswered by the NBC/Pax deal was its
impact on NBC's 220 local affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   During a news conference, NBC president Bob Wright made clear
that he sees only an upside for the network itself as he proclaimed
that the deal will give NBC a ``long-sought second outlet for our
entertainment programming.'' In Boston, that could mean viewers
will eventually be able to watch NBC programs not just on Channel 7
but also on local Pax station Channel 68.
</P>
<P>
   It is extremely unlikely that NBC would ever air first-run
programs on Channel 68 rather than Channel 7. A more plausible
scenario is that the network would use the smaller station to
broadcast reruns of miniseries, made-for-TV movies, entertainment
specials, sports events, and perhaps sitcoms and dramas _ all of
which could cut into Channel 7's audience.
</P>
<P>
   NBC, the network that coined the slogan ``Must-See TV,'' might
reduce the sense of urgency viewers feel about exactly when they
``must see'' an NBC program if there is a second channel on which
to watch the same program a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't hurt NBC, but it potentially hurts the
affiliates,'' said Michael Goodman, senior analyst at the Yankee
Group. Paul R. Krumins, a TV industry consultant who heads Copley
Entertainment, disagreed that it will cut into affiliates' audience
share but said it does increase NBC's leverage in dealing with its
affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that NBC will use Pax stations as another outlet
for news programs produced by MSNBC or CNBC, the cable channels
already eating into the audience of NBC affiliates. That could also
spell trouble for affiliates, for whom every viewer counts because
revenues are directly tied to audience levels.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Carson, general manager of Channel 7, said the
Boston station doesn't ``feel threatened'' by the NBC/Pax deal,
though he acknowledged that the audience for affiliates is
``diluted'' when viewers ``can see the same things more than once''
on other channels.
</P>
<P>
   NBC affiliates are currently in talks with the network over
``exclusivity'' arrangements that address that issue. During a
conference call among affiliate executives Thursday afternoon,
Wright joined in to discuss the Pax deal.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between NBC and its affiliates have grown testy over
issues of compensation, but Carson dismissed any speculation that
the network would ever turn to the Pax stations as its primary
delivery system. ``The reality is that the Pax stations are a bunch
of second- and third-tier UHF stations,'' he said. ``As an outlet
for programming, it would be a disaster for NBC to switch their
whole signal to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBC/Pax deal represents a triumph for Lowell W. ``Bud''
Paxson, chairman of Paxson Communications, who founded Pax TV just
one year ago as a ``family entertainment network.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Globe, Paxson
</P>
<P>
   conceded that NBC ``can do whatever they like when they own
it.''

ALTERED DRUG SHOWN TO PRODUCE CANCER-FIGHTING PROTEIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- A potent new cancer-fighting protein discovered in the
Boston lab of Dr. Judah Folkman can be made by slightly altering a
drug that's already on the market, and therefore could enter human
trials as early as next year, say officials of a Framingham biotech
firm.
</P>
<P>
   The new protein seems to be at least as powerful as endostatin,
the widely publicized tumor-starving drug also discovered in
Folkman's lab. Endostatin is about to enter its first, long-awaited
human tests in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Called antiangiogenic antithrombin, or aaAT, the new protein is
being described publicly for the first time Friday, in the current
issue of the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   Genzyme Molecular Oncology in Framingham, which has licensed the
rights to develop aaAT, announced the protein's discovery last
February but neither it nor Folkman would identify it or divulge
any details until Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Another Genzyme unit, Genyme Transgenics Corp. in Framingham, is
already producing the mother protein, called antithrombin III, that
can be chemically converted into the new tumor-shrinking drug.
Genzyme Transgenics produces antithrombin III in the milk of
genetically modified goats at its farm in Charlton. This shortcut
should make aaAT easier to make than endostatin and perhaps
cheaper, but no pricing information on either drug has been
released.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, a newly discovered substance must go through years of
development and animal testing before it can move to human clinical
trials.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, ``there should be no hindrance to human
therapeutic trials'' of aaATT, which, because it is really the same
molecule as antithrombin III, ``has been used unwittingly in
transfusion medicine for more than 10 years,'' wrote Robin W.
Carrell, a researcher at the University of Cambridge in England.
Carrell wrote a commentary on the discovery in Friday's Science. He
meant that the new protein is so similar to antithrombin III that
people who received the latter drug were getting aaAT as well, with
no additional risks.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman, the director of the surgical laboratories at Children's
and a pioneer in the study of how the body grows new blood vessels,
said the finding of the new anti-tumor protein suggests there may
still be more to be found in the body's clotting system
</P>
<P>
   ``What surprised us is that the body has such a storehouse of
proteins hidden inside other proteins that turn off blood vessel
growth and do only that,'' Folkman said.
</P>
<P>
   The substances are called angiogenesis inhibitors, because they
block the growth of new blood vessels _ a process called
angiogenesis _ that is used both in normal body functions, such as
wound healing, and is exploited by tumors so that they can grow and
spread.
</P>
<P>
   Like endostatin, angiostatin and a number of other proteins
currently offering hope of a new weapon against cancer, the new
protein attacks the linings of blood vessels that grow into tumors
to nourish them. The vessels then die off and the tumor is left
without a life support system.
</P>
<P>
   In Folkman's view, there are perhaps 8 or 10 anti-angiogenic
substances naturally in the body, and most of the time they appear
to keep any cancers that form from spreading. Therefore, giving
large doses of anti-angiogenic drugs when someone has cancer is
like enhancing the body's natural defenses. The anti-angiogenic
drugs will probably work best used in combinations with each other
and with other cancer therapies, says Folkman.
</P>
<P>
   In mouse experiments, aaAT dramatically shrank lung tumors that
had been implanted on the backs of mice, and caused no apparent ill
effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite potent,'' said Dr. Michael O'Reilly, a researcher
in the Folkman lab at Children's Hospital who discovered aaAT in
1997, shortly after also discovering endostatin. ``It's hard to say
how potent it is'' in comparison with endostatin, said O'Reilly,
because equivalent forms of aaAT and endostatin haven't yet been
tested.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful protein was discovered hiding inside antithrombin
III, which helps regulate the body's blood clotting system.
O'Reilly found that the new substance, aaAT, is made when certain
enzymes produced by tumors act on antithrombin III and change its
structure slightly. As a result of this change of shape, it no
longer affects blood clotting but instead attacks newly formed
blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly discovered aaAT when he implanted human lung tumor
cells under the skins of laboratory mice. The idea was to mimic
what sometimes happens in humans when someone has an established
tumor that has spread, creating little colonies, or metastases, at
distant sites. If surgeons remove the primary tumor, in some cases
the metastases grow more aggressively. Folkman has shown that
primary tumors can secrete antiangiogenic substances that keep
secondary cancer growths from spreading.
</P>
<P>
   In his mouse experiments, O'Reilly found that if a second tumor
was implanted on the other side of the mouse, it often was kept
small and harmless by the primary tumor's production of some
antiangiogenic substance. When he purified the material, it turned
out to be aaAT.

FORMER TREASURY CHIEF TO HEAD INITIATIVES SUPPORT CORP. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, the private-sector
financier who is widely credited with helping balance the federal
budget and managing the Asian and Mexican financial crises, has
accepted the chairmanship of the Local Initiatives Support Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Rubin, who resigned as Treasury
secretary in May, said Thursday he was making the LISC job the
first undertaking of his post-governmental life because the
problems of inner cities and distressed rural areas ``are a
critical economic issue for all of us, no matter what our economic
circumstances or where we may live.''
</P>
<P>
   LISC, a New York-based organization started in 1979 by the Ford
Foundation, manages and channels investment of billions of dollars
in private-sector funds in distressed urban and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, 61, who amassed a fortune as a top executive of the
investment house of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. before he entered
government, said: ``I will most likely re-engage in the financial
world in some serious fashion, but I have not made any judgment yet
as to how or with whom.''
</P>
<P>
   While Rubin is best known for adroit, occassionally daring
management of global economic issues, the native New Yorker was
associated with the traditional Democratic Party policies of former
New York Governor Mario Cuomo before the Clinton presidency, and he
signaled Thursday that he now will focus again on those domestic
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems are not intractable,'' he said. ``An awful lot
has been accomplished. As Treasury secretary I was struck by how
effective community leadership has been around the country at
making real progress.'' He said he was particularly interested in
helping secure access to capital for urban entrepreneurs who are
capable of large-scale undertakings, and in attracting a broader
spectrum of private-sector interests to community development
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Paul S. Grogan, who became a vice president of Harvard
University last year after 12 years as LISC's executive director,
said an initial, important function of LISC was ``raising the
comfort level for private-sector participation in affordable
housing'' development, and that Rubin would be able to lead the
organization's efforts to perform a similar function in commercial,
retail development in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin ``is a capitalist, a believer in the system, who believes
what's wrong is that not everyone is participating in the system,''
said Grogan. ``He believes you can't fix that with solely
government money, that you have to recruit private interests and
private capital. What attracted him to LISC is... it is an
organization that has done that.''

AUSTRALIANS WARNED OF PEACE-KEEPING DANGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARWIN, Australia _ Australia's leaders Thursday steeled their
nation for the grim possibility that some soldiers deployed in the
coming days to restore peace to the violence-torn territory of East
Timor may come home in bodybags.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton also pointed to the risks in deploying the
peacekeeping force, which will include 200 American support troops,
but said the mission was needed and worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us be under no misconceptions: It's going to be a
difficult and demanding task. ... I can't say there is no chance of
casualties,'' Admiral Chris Barrie, chief of the Australian Defense
Forces, told reporters here, where 4,500 Australian troops are
expected to deploy by early next week in response to a wave of
killing and destruction following a landslide vote for independence
in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Leading a multinational force to restore security and relieve
suffering there is Australia's ``most significant military
undertaking. . . . since the Second World War,'' Barrie said.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations estimates 7,000 East Timorese have been slain
since election results on Sept. 4, and at least 200,000 of the
territory's 870,000 people have fled their homes or been forcibly
relocated _ and many are in danger of starvation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a dangerous operation and I've never pretended
otherwise,'' Prime Minister John Howard said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Two newspaper polls this week show that more than 70 percent of
Australians favor sending troops to East Timor, a former Portuguese
colony just 430 miles north of here.
</P>
<P>
   But as protesters and politicians in Indonesia bluntly warned of
violence against peacekeepers, it remains to be seen how long the
Australian public will stay committed to the mission.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Thursday authorized about 200 US troops for logistics,
intelligence and transport, as well as elements of the US Pacific
Fleet for support. ``Of course, on any mission like this there are
dangers and risks of casualties,'' Clinton said. ``But this force
is well-equipped for the job and it is a job that is in the
interest of peace and stability.''
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen other nations, including Thailand, Canada,
Britain, New Zealand and South Korea, have offered soldiers to the
mission. Unlike the UN peacekeeping operation in Bosnia, where
blue-helmet forces were hamstrung by limited rules of engagement,
the force planned for East Timor has the mandate to use deadly
force to stop violence.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia has had as many as 26,000 troops in East Timor in the
last week, and a condition of Jakarta's decision last Sunday to
invite foreign peacekeepers was that they would serve alongside
Indonesian troops. Western officials have voiced concerns that
Indonesian soldiers _ who stood by or even aided rampaging militias
_ might sabotage the peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You read about special forces doing things in a clandestine
and a covert way,'' Barrie said. ``My biggest apprehension is that
things don't go the way I've outlined them and we don't get the
cooperation we need.''
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975, sparking a war of
resistance. By 1980, 200,000 people had died from battle, famine
and disease. Indonesia's military is blamed for gross human rights
abuses in East Timor over the years, and for aiding pro-Jakarta
militias. Australia was the only major nation to recognize
Indonesian rule in East Timor, but it also became Jakarta's loudest
critic during the latest crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia Thursday scrapped a 4-year-old security treaty with
Australia to protest perceived meddling and support for Timorese
independence. It was largely symbolic, but it exposes growing
tensions in what is arguably the most important strategic
relationship in the south Pacific.

   Australia spends nearly $5 billion a year training Indonesian
military officers at Australian colleges and in joint exercises
here and in Indonesia. Australia even trained Indonesia's special
forces branch _ which is blamed for orchestrating militia violence
in East Timor _ until last October, when strong evidence of human
rights abuses elsewhere by the unit emerged.
</P>
<P>
   At a protest in Jakarta Thursday, one demonstrator held a banner
reading: ``Australian soldiers welcome to East Timor. Graves have
been prepared for you. Rest in hell.''
</P>
<P>
   The Australian embassy in Jakarta, the consulate in Bali and
several Australian businesses received threatening telephone calls
Thursday, and two Australian mining companies pulled staff out to
Singapore as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   An advance team of 25 Australian and 25 Thai military officers
will visit East Timor Saturday and the first wave of 2,000 foreign
troops is expected to deploy by Monday, Indonesian military
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise announcement, Indonesia's commander in East Timor,
Maj. Gen. Kiki Syahnakri, said his troops would pull out once UN
forces arrive. ``Once they get in, I will pull out. I hope the
process will take not more than one week,'' he told Reuters news
service. It was unclear, however, whether he was referring to the
multinational force or to a UN-organized force expected to replace
this mission later this year.

COMMENTARY: PARTYING IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Riding with the waves, Fortune magazine in New
York has come up with a terrific, with-it, win-win idea.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese Communist Politburo has organized for Oct. 1 a
national celebration of the 50th anniversary of the People's
Republic following the military triumph of Mao Tse-tung. Everybody
knows where office and factory workers will stand, precisely what
slogans to shout, and which Chinese with a dissident political or
religious record the police will take off the streets during the
celebration.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But every big party needs celebrities. Not very many would have
shown up on their own just for the Communist Party's victory
banquets. So Fortune invited the kind of celebrities the Politburo
loves most _ top foreign business executives from America and other
countries to go to Shanghai from Sept. 27 to 29 for an economic
forum and then to Beijing, where their private planes are
guaranteed red-runway treatment. Only multinational business,
please, and only chairmen, presidents and CEOs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The enticement was knowing they would get the chance to meet
Chinese who interest them most, those who approve business
contracts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fortune said President Jiang Zemin had ``graciously'' agreed to
give the keynote speech in Shanghai. You learn to talk real humble
if you do business with the Chinese Communists. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 CEOs have signed up already; a real A-list. About
a dozen of the world's communication chiefs whose employees are
supposed to report on China are listed _ including Time Warner,
Fortune's owner; CNN, and NBC. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Top folk from American industry, finance and commerce will be
there, from Boeing to Calvin Klein. The Boeing man will be chairman
Philip Condit, forever a historical footnote for saying that his
attitude toward human rights violations in China was the same as
his attitude toward them in America _ after all, people have been
beaten and shot in the U.S. civil rights struggle, haven't they? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I think that for any member of the press to organize a party for
a government dictatorship is damaging to the publication and the
rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   But the basic problem is what goes on in the minds of the
Condits: The pretense of American business, and the legislators its
money helps elect, that it cannot see the obligation of American
corporations to use their economic power to help the viciously
oppressed; the sardonic stand that American faults can be equated
with Beijing's use of terror as the instrument of government; the
philosophy that money comes uber alles, even uber American
principles, and what their own religions teach.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, of course, uber God.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Everything having to do with business and profits and how to get
more of both is on the Shanghai agenda _ everything except the
human rights of the Chinese who are buying our products and
providing our cheap labor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch in China is not questioning, as I am, the
very idea of businessmen getting together to worship the money idol
in China. But it pleads with business people to read the accounts
of the independent-minded Chinese sentenced to labor camps and how
they were tortured, sometimes forced to exist in their own feces.
And then please _ stand up in China, and use the safety of foreign
passports to dare to speak up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People often ask me: Don't you get a feeling of defeat, writing
so much about human rights in China and other dictatorships, all
the while knowing that leaders of America, particularly the
president and the business community, grovel to the Chinese?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Often. But then I think of the former Chinese prisoner Harry Wu,
who secretly went back to the labor camps to track the fate of
those still there. And I think of Rep. Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat who
has not weakened on Chinese human rights for a moment. She
represents San Francisco, so I asked her what she would say this
time. She thinks about it and then sends me this message: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The spectacle of the U.S. CEOs kowtowing to the Chinese
Communist leaders is grotesque but not new. This time, however,
when the CEOs stand in Tiananmen Square with the Beijing regime to
``celebrate'' 50 years of killing and repression, they will have
blood on the soles of their shoes.''

``President-of-the-USA.com.'' For another $30,000, buyers also can
have ``President-USA.net.'' But Jeff Tinsley, chief executive of a
domain name broker GreatDomains, which recently auctioned Drugs.Com
for more than $800,000, said Sterling is shooting a bit high for
the domain name she owns. His advice: Ask for $30,000. By Jason
Cohen. (Will move in the ``f'' financial news file.)

TEXT OF LETTERS SENT BY THE FORT WORTH CHURCH GUNMAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas: visit a bar. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in late June I went to his house to pick him up and
take him to the bar he wanted to go to. We started out with him
directing me to go toward west Fort Worth on Loop 820. When we got
all the way around to the west side of ``820'' he began discussing
with his brother which bar to go to. Evenutally they settled on a
bar on Highway 180 even though we already exited on to Route 199.
After turning around and getting to ``80'' my passengers decided
they didn't want to go there either. I then took them home. To make
a long story short: in the foolowing year up to April of ``89'' I
continued to go over to this persons house after he would call me.
There were two recurrent phrases that continued to come up in
various conversations with him. The first was that he ``was going
to do a cemetary job.'' Initially when I asked what he meant he
said that he did lawn maintenance at a cemetary. Then he would cite
this quote which he said went back to someone else: ``Live by
cancer, die by cancer.'' All he meant by this, he would say, ws
that he was of the zodiac sign of the cancer and that so was I.
This relationship continued until the day of Rick Green's arrest
for the murders of several people in west Fort Worth. When I called
him up several times after Green's arrest I was told by someone
else that he was at ``another location.'' He did not contact me
again. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The possible connection is this: Ricky Green abducted two women
from a bar on ``199.'' Wendy Robinson was abducted from Lake
Weatherford which is near ``180.'' Was the drive my acquiantances
took me on supposed to be a test of some sort? I believe it was. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After Ricky Greens arrest I realized the reasons for my
troubles. There was no doubt. However; I could not forsee, at that
time, that there was another serial murderer, Faryion Waldrip, who
fit the same physical description of both Green and myself. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What could I have done about it? I tried for months to find a
lawyer who might make a case for me. After a year or so it was
evident no lawyers were going to be interested. Then I began making
contact with the media. I contacted three newspapers: The Dallas
Morning News, The Dallas Times Herald and The Fort Worth
Star-Telegram. All with no result. I contacted each of the network
TV station affiliate news rooms. None were interested. During one
conversation with a TV news anchor he asked me an odd question:
``Didn't you recently get out of the military.'' Certainly that
struck me as a very strange or evne suspicious question for him to
ask. Why would he possibly think that I had been in the military? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I have sought the assistance of many different people. I could
relate many more events that indicate that I was targeted as a
suspected serial murderer. There are many names of people whom I
could identify as being a party to the events. If just one
individual admitted, for there part what I allege, then I believe
the others would begin to be proven. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What I am asking is for you to investigate and tell my story. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sincerely,
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Sir
</P>
<P>
   This communication is an addendum to the July 31 letter. It is
obvious that you are uninterested in my story. Therefore, I find it
necessary to amplify certain aspects of it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Consider one of three situations I experienced where people I
had never met volunteered that they were either former Central
Intelligence Agency employees or were laision with the CIA while
they were in the military. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, after being fired from the company I worked for in
July, as I related earlier, I got a job with a forging company in
Fort Worth. On the morning I reported to that company I aws to be
indoctrinated into the opearations of the machine shop by the shop
foreman. Unfortunately, it was not so much an indocrination as it
was a recounting of the mans exploits in Viet Nam. Particularly his
story was about how he worked laision with the CIA and his exploits
included special forces operations which entailed assissination of
enemy political units. This lecture lasted the entire morning. From
eight until lunchtime. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If this were the only time I had ever encountered someone who
voluntered such a story I would think nothing of it. However, since
it is one of three encounters and since it falls within the time
period that I am certain that I was being targeted as a suspected
serial murderer, then I must consider it a relevant part of my
situation. My employment at this company eventually became
impossible and I quit. Not because I could not work with them but
because they did not want to work with me. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Without belaboring the point with my experiences, I will call to
your attention two stories that have come out of the news in the
last decade. The first involved the Tarrant County Sheriffs
Department. I believe the year was 1991; and in that year there was
a situation which came to light in which it was found that reserve
deputies with the sheriffs department, who were full time U.S.
Airforce personel, were also discovered to be affiliated with the
Ku Klux Klan. What I particularly recall is that when one of those
involved personel was interviewed on TV (KXAS Channel 5, NBC
affiliate) he directly stated that they were involved in ``going
after child abductors.'' Amy Robinson's abductor perhaps? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The second also involved the sheriff's department. The year was,
I believe, ``95'' or ``96.'' The story that came out disclosed that
an individual or individuals within the department had had, for
some time, a web site that contained the dossier's of suspects in a
criminal investigation. These files were being made available to
civilians so as to enable them to aid in the ``criminal''
investigations. The implication of this should be obvious with
regard to my allegations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What I must wonder about is the reason that no news reporting
agency, particularly yours, is interested in this story. Is it
because you think it implausible or unimportant? Is it because the
general political climate in Fort Worth is not conducive to such a
story? Or is there a clue in the words of John Chriswell, then news
anchor for the CBS affiliate, when he asked me, as I was attempting
to explain my situation: ``Didn't you just get out of the
military?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is apparent to me that the suspicions against me have been
widely disseminated. I believe that there are a few individuals who
would realize no damage to themselves if they admitted to the truth
regarding my allegations.
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect,
</P>
<P>

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Larry Gene Ashbrook, who killed seven people
and wounded seven others at a Fort Worth church before committing
suicide Wednesday night, wrote to the Star-Telegram this year with
bizarre tales of persecution. The text of the letters is provided
here, exactly as received. The grammatical and spelling mistakes

</P>
<P>
   July 31, 1999
</P>
<P>
   Sir:
</P>
<P>
   I am interested in relating to you some events I have
experienced. If these events are true, then they would indicate a
serious injustice against me. Specifically: the denial of due
process for me in the investigation of me as a suspected serial
murderer. I use the term ``investigation'' loosely. It was not so
much an investigation as it was a continuous intereference in my
life and employment for a period of possibly twenty years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Three operative terms apply to this situation: First; rumor
control, this was one method by which those investigating me used
to create problems for me: Second: Psychological warfare, this was
the general mode of of operation: Third: Plausible deniability, the
ideas those involved would proffer in order to divert blame from
themselves. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first experience I had which became a clue to my future
problems occured in July of ``79.'' Soon after reporting to a
deployment site with the U.S. Navy squadron, I attended a social
event. While there I was pulled aside by a young man who was in
that squadron and he asked me some odd questions. The questions
involved the murder of someone I had no knowledge of. The tone of
his questions became almost accusatory. This was the first of three
similar events which occured during my active duty with the Navy
from ``79'' to ``83.'' What I eventually began to wonder was if
there were any reason for me to be a suspect in any murder. As I
now know, there were several abductions or murders of young women
in Fort Worth and Arlington during the ``70s'' when I lived in the
area. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After I moved back to Fort Worth in ``84'' the odd events became
a major problem in my life and occurred both on and off the job.
The seriousness of the events and the humiliation I sufered made it
impossible for me to keep a job. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most pronounced situation began soon after I began work at
the Photo-Etch Company in 1986. Shortly after I was hired as a
machinist I was put on the evening shift with another employee who
was hired about a week after me. We were the only workers at the
company during that shift. At some point around September of that
year in the evening I was taking a break when the other employee
walked up to me and made a somewhat veiled indirect threat. It went
like this: ``I have a lot of friends on the police force, in fact I
know a woman police officer who can kick your (deleted) all over
the place.'' This was the beginning of continuous troubles on the
job at that company. When I attempted to remedy the problems
through the proper channels I got no where. The troubles included
minor physical abuse and general disrespect by another employee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eventually after about six months of the situation I was visited
by the owners son. He identified himself as the one who oversees
the machine shop (even though I had never met him) and he called me
a liar concerning what was happening on the job. It was obvious
then that there was nothing I could do to remedy the situation and
I quit to look for another job. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During the period of unemployment that ensued the most blatant
event occurred. At that time in my life I was not dating,
socializing or spending much time with others. One evening I
decided to go out for a beer and I ended up at a nightclub on East
Lancaster. After I had been there for a few minutes a man came and
sat next to me at the bar. All that I recall of him is that he
talked about he had been in the U.S. Army special forces. During
the time we talked I began to feel slightly sick so I went to the
restroom. After a short time I felt better; however as I returned
to my seat I became very dizzy and passed out. Never before had I
experienced such an event. I was partically concious and was aware
that I as dragged out to the back of the bar by several men.
Eventually I told them that I believed that I had been durgged and
would they call the police. ``We are the police'' was one man's
reply. I was held against the wall with one mans hand around my
throat for several minutes. During that time I described for them
the man who had been sitting next to me. If they did search for him
they didn't find him. After a while I felt better and left. Had I
been at the east Fort Worth bar that Linda Taylor was abducted from
by Farryion Wardrip two years earlier? I have other reasons for
suspecting this. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next job I had I was fired from, for no valid reason, one
week after the abduction of Wendy Robinson from Lake Weatherford. I
believe there was a connection. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, around the late summer, I began to seek the audience of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I certainly had reason to
believe I was being targeted by some investigative group. I was
unable to get an agent over the phone as the young woman who was
answering the phones would not connect me with one for reasons I've
never understood. By June ``88'' I decide to pay a visit to the FBI
office in person. I went to the down town Fort Worth Federal Court
House third floor office of the FBI and asked to speak with an
agent. An agent, I will not list his name here, invited me to sit
in his office and he would hear what I had to say. The problem,
though, is that he listened for about one minute then stood-up and
told me that I would be ``contacted.'' I did not believe him
though. I shook his hand and left. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Within about ten days I began to be visited by a person from the
neighborhood whom I had only been slightly acquainted with years
earlier. During the course of our initial, short, conversations he
asked me if I would be a ``designated'' driver for him and his
brother some time. I told him that I was uninterested. He continued
to come around for several weeks with the same request until my
interest was piqued and I consented to be his designated driver so
that he and his brother could visit a bar. &QL;

CHURCH SHOOTER SENT STRANGE LETTERS TO PAPER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN ROUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Larry Gene Ashbrook sent at least two
letters to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram over the summer describing
bizarre tales of encounters with the Central Intelligence Agency,
psychological warfare, assaults by co-workers and druggings by
police.
</P>
<P>
   In the letters, dated July 31 and Aug. 10, Ashbrook said some
people mistakenly believed that he was a serial killer or child
abductor or linked to several high-profile crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were outlandish things in these letters,'' City Editor
Stephen Kaye.MDNM/ said. The first letter ``rambled. It was hard to
follow. It didn't seem very plausible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My immediate reaction was that there was not much we could do
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Ashbrook paid a visit to Kaye at the Star-Telegram's
downtown office.
</P>
<P>
   But the man Kaye recalls meeting was unlike the man the nation
has come to know as the man who shot seven people to death and
wounded seven others Wednesday night. Ashbrook also killed himself
after the slaughter at Wedgwood Baptist Church in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, he was just the opposite of someone you'd be
concerned about,'' said Kaye, describing Ashbrook as a tall, thin
man with somewhat long hair. ``He was very cordial. He was very
apologetic for bothering me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept saying, `You're not a bother, I just can't do anything
for you. These are hard things to prove that are in your letter.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Kaye, who made one unsuccessful attempt to contact Ashbrook by
phone after receiving the letters, invited him to send a letter to
the editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I'm sorry to take your time up,' '' Kaye said. ``He
couldn't have been any nicer.''
</P>
<P>
   Managing Editor Kathy Vetter.MDNM/ also received copies of the
letters from Ashbrook, and wrote him a short reply saying that the
paper could offer no remedy for his problems and suggesting that he
seek an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in the letters appeared threatening, Vetter and Kaye
said. Had they been, police would have been contacted, Vetter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see letters like that two and three times a week,'' Vetter
said. They are often from people who feel they're being persecuted,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, you just can't look at these things and see
danger. I wish I could do that, because if I had that ability,
those things would go to the cops every time. But 99.99 percent of
them are just people who want to vent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never before in my career have they turned out to be anything,
and it's hard to believe that they ever will again,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The letters were given to Fort Worth police Thursday, after Kaye
heard a radio program about Ashbrook and realized his connection to
the letters.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives said Thursday that they had not had time to read the
letters.
</P>
<P>
   Having met Ashbrook left an impression on Kaye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can go through a situation like this, where
you've had a contact with someone and then this has happened, and
not feel something,'' said Kaye, who is part of the team of editors
coordinating news coverage of the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a little eerie that he was here and that he was
reaching out to the newspaper,'' Kaye said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators interviewed a man Thursday who had been
circulating letters in the community warning about germ warfare
after residents became concerned that the letters might have come
from Ashbrook.
</P>
<P>
   That man said he stopped distribution a couple of days ago after
a police officer told him that residents were complaining and
warned him to stop.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokesman Bob Garrity Jr..MDNM/ said there appears to be no
connection between Ashbrook and the germ-warfare letters.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ The threat of terrorism spread to Russia's heartland
Thursday as a huge explosion tore apart an apartment complex in the
southern city of Volgodonsk, killing at least 18 people and leaving
more than 200 injured.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing, at 5:57 a.m., was the fifth in Russia in less than
three weeks and underscored how vulnerable Russia remains to
terrorist attacks, even with heightened security. Almost 280 people
have died in the mysterious series of explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's blast bore the hallmarks of the earlier detonations
that have frightened and bewildered the public. The target was an
apartment house for ordinary citizens. The bomb went off as they
were sleeping. And no one claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The blast went off just nine miles from a nuclear power plant.
Russian authorities said the plant was unfinished and had not been
supplied with nuclear fuel. But the episode has generated concern
that terrorists may turn to their attention to Russia's vast
nuclear infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Vladimir Putin signed a decree calling on law
enforcement and other government agencies to develop plans within
three days to protect industry, transportation, communications,
food processing centers and nuclear complexes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to grit our teeth,'' Putin told a meeting of Russia's
cabinet. ``I'm calling on you to be more disciplined and vigilant,
in deeds not words.''
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin said security forces would try to seal
off the breakaway republic of Chechnya. There should be ``no
transport links'' to Chechnya, Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
   For all the tough talk, the images on the television news
Thursday night seemed to underscore the nation's defenselessness.
The bomb in Volgodonsk was hidden inside a truck or in a manhole.
It left a 50-foot-wide crater. The facade of the apartment house
was peeled away and the ground littered with mutilated bodies.
</P>
<P>
   One woman featured in Thursday night's news broadcast regained
consciousness in the hospital only to find out that her husband was
dead and her children missing. The death toll is likely to rise as
rescuers pick through the debris. About 25 of those hospitalized
are in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's bombing is the first outside Moscow since the string
of explosions began Aug. 31 at the upscale Manezh shopping center
near the Kremlin. The blast Thursday suggested that terrorists were
responding to the stepped-up security in the capital by taking
their campaign to less protected towns and cities.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Volgodonsk, about 700 miles south of Moscow, was established in
1956 when workers came to the area to build a dam and hydroelectric
plant. A factory, formerly named after Soviet leader Leonid
Brezhnev, was built there to produce equipment for nuclear power
stations.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion also gave some credence to ominous reports that a
band of Islamic militants was planning a nationwide campaign of
violence. Vyacheslav Izmailov, who is a specialist on the Caucasus
for the newspaper Novaya Gazeta and is also a retired military
officer, said he had been tipped off by an informant that 10
attacks were planned in Moscow and that other bombings would take
place in St. Petersburg and in the Rostov area, where Volgodonsk is
located.
</P>
<P>
   Izmailov said the informant indicated the explosions were
organized by two leaders of the Islamic insurgency in Dagestan,
Shamil Basayev and Khattab. But he said the attacks are being
carried out by Slavic mercenaries, as well as Chechens, making it
difficult for the authorities to identify the terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Basayev and Khattab have denied any involvement. But Izmailov's
account has been widely accepted by many Russians, adding to the
climate of fear.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The bombing has unnerved residents of Rostov-on-Don, a large
city about 120 miles to the west, where a festival has been planned
for Saturday to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Moscow explosions, we canceled the evening festival
events,'' a Rostov resident named Tatyana, who declined to give her
last name, said in a telephone interview. ``After Volgodonsk, we
canceled the entire festival. People are really scared.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Tatyana, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and other
dignitaries from the capital were expected at the celebration, but
now only Patriarch Aleksy II of the Russian Orthodox Church is
planning to attend a religious service.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As rescuers combed through the rubble at Volgodonsk, police in
Moscow continued their efforts to safeguard the capital. A police
spokesman said that a new cache of explosives _ more than three
tons disguised as 76 sacks of sugar _ was found in a garage.
</P>
<P>
   The garage was rented by the same man who leased space in the
two apartment houses demolished in bombing attacks here. He used
the stolen passport of a dead man named Mukhit Laipanov.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Moscow police said they had uncovered another large
cache of explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Berezovsky, a tycoon and former executive secretary of the
Commonwealth of Independent States, an organization of former
Soviet republics, said he believed the blasts had been organized by
Chechen militants.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that Russia's leading politicians were to blame
because they failed to come up with a political plan for restoring
Chechnya or develop a military plan to contain the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrorist acts won't be halted,'' he said. ``It will go on for
a long time.''

 &HT;    WITH SUICIDE NOTE, FORMER DRUG PROSECUTOR TRIES TO IMPLICATE
MEXICAN PRESIDENT IN KILLINGS
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ With a fatal overdose of anti-depressants, Mario
Ruiz Massieu beat the rap the U.S. government was about to mount
against him alleging drug trafficking at some of the highest levels
in the Mexican government.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday _ the day after his reported suicide _ it became
clear that the former Mexican anti-drug prosecutor was still trying
to strike back from the grave.
</P>
<P>
   In a suicide note revealed by his lawyer Thursday in New Jersey,
Ruiz Massieu accused Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo of being
involved in the 1994 assassination of presidential candidate Luis
Donaldo Colosio, who represented Mexico's ruling Revolutionary
Institutional Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   He also implicated Zedillo in the 1994 killing of Ruiz Massieu's
brother, Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, who was also a high-ranking
PRI official.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations in Mario Ruiz Massieu's note were immediately
dismissed by members of the Zedillo administration, who were busy
with activities on Thursday celebrating Mexico's Independence Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mario Ruiz Massieu lived lying and died lying,'' said Mexican
Attorney General Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, interviewed by reporters at
an Independence Day parade. ``Mr. Mario Ruiz Massieu on various
occasions tried to deflect blame by tossing smoke bombs to confuse
public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   The assassinations of Colosio and Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu
are woven into a tangled web of scandal and political and
drug-related violence that has disgusted Mexicans, tainted the PRI
and obliterated the reputation of Mexico's last president, Carlos
Salinas de Gortari, who served between 1988 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   And now, Mario Ruiz Massieu's suicide ``is another death along a
dark road in Mexico that leads nowhere and everywhere at the same
time,'' said Milenio magazine editor Ignacio Rodriguez Reyna.
</P>
<P>
   The 48-year-old Ruiz Massieu reportedly took his own life at his
home in New Jersey just two days before he was to be arraigned in
Houston on charges that he laundered $9.9 million in alleged drug
bribes. Last month Ruiz Massieu was indicted for illegally moving
the illicit millions into Texas banks from Mexico. He was under
house arrest in New Jersey, where he fled from Mexico four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The trial in Houston, Rodriguez Reyna said, could have revealed
potentially explosive allegations about drug traffickers' influence
in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there are politicians in Mexico who are breathing
easier today,'' Rodriguez Reyna said after hearing about the
suicide Wednesday. ``Massieu must have known who else in government
had ties to narcotics trafficking. There was always quiet talk in
government that prosecutors here were too afraid to look too deeply
into his drug connections.''
</P>
<P>
   During Salinas' administration, Ruiz Massieu was a deputy
federal prosecutor in charge of hunting down and jailing the same
narcotics traffickers he was accused of assisting.
</P>
<P>
   In March of 1995, Ruiz Massieu was traveling en route to Spain
when he was arrested at the Newark International Airport in New
Jersey for failing to declare all of $46,000 in cash he was
carrying.
</P>
<P>
   After Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu was murdered in 1994, Mario
Ruiz Massieu was the prosecutor put in charge of investigating the
killing.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, before his death, Mexican officials wanted to bring
Mario back to Mexico and have him stand trial on corruption charges
and for allegedly covering up the real story behind his brother's
death.
</P>
<P>
   For four years, Mexican authorities tried to have Ruiz Massieu
extradited to Mexico to face charges related to his brother's
murder and abuse of his authority. Authorities here say Ruiz
Massieu conducted a sham investigation designed to protect his
brother's real killer _ Raul Salinas, Carlos Salinas' brother, who
has been convicted in the murder.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Salinas is also believed to have accepted millions of
dollars in bribes from drug traffickers. Swiss authorities believe
he stashed the drug money in Swiss and British bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz Massieu's lawyers say he was suffering from extreme
depression and apparently could not face the possibility of a
conviction and life in prison in connection with the charges in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Ruiz Massieu claimed he was innocent and the
victim of a conspiracy built on fabricated evidence and paid
witnesses. He apparently did not try to link Zedillo to drug
trafficking in his final message to the public, but he didn't mince
words about the assassinations of Colosio and his brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``To find my brother's murderers an investigation should be
initiated beginning with Zedillo,'' Ruiz Massieu wrote in the
letter.
</P>
<P>
   In a reference to Colosio and his brother, Ruiz Massieu also
wrote, ``(Zedillo) and I know that he was not detached from both
political crimes of 1994.''
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Zedillo administration predicted that Ruiz
Massieu's accusations would not take root in Mexico and would fade
after several days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not dealing with a martyr here,'' the official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, added. He said Ruiz Massieu's
reputation was so poor that few would take him seriously for long.
</P>
<P>
   But Mexico is a country where conspiracy theories thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Some here met the news of Ruiz Massieu's reported death by
suicide with skepticism. A few people interviewed on streets in
Mexico City by television stations said they thought it was
possible Ruiz Massieu was killed to keep him from spilling too many
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in New Jersey said Ruiz Massieu appeared to have died
by taking an overdose of Zoloft, a drug used to treat depression.
An autopsy is being performed.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman John Russell at the U.S. Justice Department in
Washington, said that the case against Ruiz Massieu will probably
be dismissed after an official cause of death is confirmed.

 &HT;    Y2K concerns cause Ohio schools to delay winter term
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The Y2K bug _ or at least the fear of it _ is
stinging some of the region's colleges.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Dayton will postpone the start of its winter
term two days and Cedarville College one day as a precautionary
measure against potential year-2000 computer glitches. Other
schools will closely watch events to determine whether they'll need
to cancel classes for a ``calamity day.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayton and Cedarville join Ohio State University, which had
already announced it would delay the start of classes from Jan. 3
to Jan. 5.
</P>
<P>
   School officials insist their own computer systems are _ or soon
will be _ Y2K compliant, and they foresee no major problems on
their technology-dependent campuses. But some out-of-state students
and their families had let school folks know they didn't
particularly want to fly cross-country the day after the witching
hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're being extra-cautious, which is fine'' for this
unique circumstance, said Tom Westendorf, UD's registrar. UD will
start winter classes Jan. 5 instead of Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   UD's computer and telecommunications specialists told university
officials they were concerned about Y2K-related problems in the
newly expanded student network and recommended the delay to ensure
the system was healthy and ready for students when they return,
Westendorf said.
</P>
<P>
   Cedarville College spokesman Roger Overturf said the college's
decision to push back winter term one day was made ``to allay the
fears of those who have Y2K concerns,'' especially those who must
travel to return to school. Cedarville will now start classes Jan.
4.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State University officials don't expect any serious Y2K
problems on campus, but OSU Interim Chief Information Officer James
Davis said it's ``impossible to anticipate all Y2K-related problems
or to predict all Y2K-related behaviors with 100 percent certainty.
While the probability of major problems is now very low, there will
continue to be a risk of glitches that will need to be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Miami Valley schools _ including Edison Community College,
Central State University and Antioch College _ already are
scheduled to start later in January and do not face a decision on
whether to postpone the startup of winter term. Wright State
University, Sinclair Community College and the University of
Cincinnati are among schools deciding to make no change in their
Jan. 3 resumption of classes.
</P>
<P>
   A special Wright State task force examined the potential impact
of Y2K, gathering information from hundreds of suppliers and
vendors that provide the university's power, transportation,
financial and other services, and came away assured that there
would be no significant problems, said Paul Hernandez, WSU's
director of computing and telecommunications services.
</P>
<P>
   If major problems do occur, WSU will follow the same delay and
cancellation procedures it would for a weather emergency, Hernandez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sinclair will approach the challenge the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come Jan. 2, if we find the world is caving in around us, we
may announce we won't have classes the next day,'' Sinclair
spokesman Gary Honnert said.

ART REVIEW: A VERY BIG DIG _ CHINA'S TROPHIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: D.C. area, Houston, San Francisco)   (bl)  
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Golden Age of Chinese Archaeology: Celebrated Discoveries
from the People's Republic of China,'' which opens Sunday at the
National Gallery of Art in Washington, makes every possible effort
to knock your socks off. And through a sheer bigger-than-life,
Turandot-in-Beijing style spectacle it succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   The show is a compilation of more than 200 objects, many of
which have been brought to light in China during the past 25 years
or so. The National Gallery did a similar show in 1974 in
cooperation with the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City;
the current one, put together by the same museums, is being billed
as a kind of update.
</P>
<P>
   The time frame covered is broad, to put it mildly. It begins in
the late prehistoric period, circa 5000 to 2000 B.C., and ends
semi-late, in the 10th century A.D. The media represented are many:
bronze, lacquerware, jade and silk head an eclectic list. The
objects selected run from exemplary to awesome, and they are served
up in a theatrical, charisma-enhancing installation.
</P>
<P>
   You don't just look at this show. You are encouraged to gasp at
the sight of colossal bronze cauldrons, sigh over long-buried
silks, get the shivers in a simulated crypt and enjoy an interlude
of comic relief at the sight of snooty court ladies with figures as
round as pots.
</P>
<P>
   The total spectacle is riveting and rewards any time spent with
it. But, that said, there are some caveats. The material isn't all
that fresh. Several of the big-gun attractions _ the jade shroud
from the tomb of Liu Sheng, terra-cotta warriors from Shaanxi _
have been textbook staples for years. And certain pieces, or types
of pieces, are repeats from the Guggenheim Museum's popular
``China: 5000 Years,'' which played New York last year.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the National Gallery exhibition, like the
Guggenheim's, is conceived on a badly outmoded, trophy-show model,
one that both creates and reinforces an appetite for more of the
same. There are differences though in the approaches the two
institutions have taken.
</P>
<P>
   The Guggenheim presented its Chinese art Bloomingdales-style, by
medium. Walking up the Frank Lloyd Wright ramp, you had your bronze
department; you had your jade department. Everything looked
expensive and beautiful, which, of course, it was. But any sense of
historical or social complexity, or of diverse cultures _ elite and
nonelite, urban and regional _ bubbling up in China, has been
glamorized out of existence, and just at the time when with-it art
historical research is pointing in exactly the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington show, organized by Xiaoneng Yang, curator of
Chinese art at the Nelson-Atkins, at least complicates that
picture. The title declares right up front that, yes, this is a
buffet event, heavier on snacks than food (there is a distinction),
though some of the snacks will be pretty sensational. And the show
makes an effort to suggest the myriad, often interactive cultures
at work in a huge chunk of geography over a long history.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition starts with Neolithic vessels and jades unearthed
at various sites, mostly in the 1970s and '80s. Taken together they
might be seen as a kind of esthetic starter kit; the seeds of
Chinese writing, figurative art and the near-mystical reverence for
jade are all here.
</P>
<P>
   So is a wealth of eye-catching beauty. From the Majiyayao
culture comes a clay pot covered with whorls of calligraphic black
lines. And from the Taosi Longshan culture is a basin painted with
suavely moderne patterns of tilting pink and white rectangles on a
black ground. This vessel turned up in 1982; its design is, so far,
unique, and it is making its publication debut in the show's
catalog.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronze Age, circa 2000 to 771 B.C., brings onto the stage
metal objects, the ritual beakers and cups and wine jars that have
for centuries been regarded as spiritual embodiments of ancient
China. Whether petite or ponderous (one cooking pot in the show
creaks in at 500 pounds), they are utensils rather than sculptures,
with specific uses in life and beyond the grave.
</P>
<P>
   No art made anywhere else really resembles them. With their
dark, amphibious-looking, gravity-soaked forms, they suggest living
things, silently absorbing and radiating energy. Yet for all their
heft they can be lyrical, even buoyant, with rhythmic lines coiling
across their surfaces, and arpeggios of tacklike knobs standing out
in relief.
</P>
<P>
   The show offers stellar examples of the early dynastic vessel
types familiar in many Western museums. But it also includes a
group of startlingly expressive figurative sculptures that were
produced in southern China during the same period and occupy a
different universe from the northern classical norm.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are three hollow bronze heads, two still partly
covered with gold leaf. Most impressive, though, is a life-size
figure, the only one yet recovered from Bronze Age China, perched
on a high base. Possibly a deity or a priest, his body tapers
gently upward (think of the shape of a wooden clothespin) from the
hem of his flared robe to his cylindrical head. He holds his
enormous hands, the fingers curled into circles, out in front of
him.
</P>
<P>
   This enigmatic being is among the more remarkable discoveries of
the 1980s. And though he is no longer hot archaeological news, his
presence here is important as a dramatic example of parallel
traditions flowing through Chinese art.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if the Washington show has anything substantially novel
to offer, it is its concentration of work from southern and
southwestern China. This is particularly true of a trove of
material from the state of Chu. Installed for maximum impact at the
top of the stairs in the second-floor galleries, it constitutes a
mini-show in itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Chu state flourished between the eighth and third centuries
B.C., far from the imperial capitals, and was once regarded by
historians as a semibarbaric backwater. But this view has been
revised. The sprawling state had an ambitious, sophisticated
aristocracy, a religion with shamanistic overtones and an
innovative art that is only beginning to be understood.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Chu sculpture can be persuasively naturalistic, as in the case
of a painted lacquer deer with a teardrop-patterned coat and real
antlers. But it can also be outlandish beyond belief. An attenuated
bronze figure, with a plump bird's body, a serpentine neck and
horns bristling from its head is as surreal an image as China has
ever produced.
</P>
<P>
   This creature was discovered in the tomb of a nobleman, Marquis
Yi of Zeng, excavated in 1978, and is one of the revelatory finds
of the past quarter century. Snugly built, nearly airtight, the
tomb was essentially a below-ground version of a four-room palace.
</P>
<P>
   There was an armory and a bedroom, where the marquis was
interred with his eight concubines. The ``kitchen'' held the
coffins of 13 young women, presumably servants or musicians. And
the living room or reception hall was equipped with a full court
orchestra of chimes, woodwinds, drums and 65 bronze bells. These
bells are not in the show, but a set of 26 from another site is.
</P>
<P>
   The site yielded the single largest cache, pound for pound, of
bronze objects ever discovered in one place, and examples of this
hoard are on view. One is a bronze drum stand in the form of a
seething tangle of snakelike dragons that could come straight from
Rodin's ``Gates of Hell.'' Another is a wine vessel set in a low,
wide bowl, both covered with a filigree encrustation that looks
exquisite and pathological, as if it were eating away the solid
form beneath.
</P>
<P>
   Chu art has been described as flamboyant, but it goes way, way
beyond that into some wild, demonic rococo realm. Yet it also has
its stately side, evident in the stolid set of bells in the show.
</P>
<P>
   Such instruments were not casual accessories, the Chu equivalent
of a piano in the parlor; they were emblems of social and political
power as well as a source of pleasure. The central, symbolic role
of music in ancient Chinese culture is a rich field for
cross-disciplinary research, and it is the subject of at least two
other exhibitions this season: one opens Friday at China Institute
in New York; the other is scheduled to open April 30 at the Arthur
M. Sackler Gallery in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   When the National Gallery show arrives at imperial China, it is
on well-trod ground. Here, as at the Guggenheim, one finds a suite
of life-size terra-cotta warriors and horses from the tomb of the
first emperor at Shaanxi. Also on hand is the body-fitting jade
shroud from the tomb of Liu Sheng. From the top of its helmet to
the soles of its booties, it is made of hundreds of small cut
plaques sewn together with gold thread. In the same room is a less
finely made shroud, which has recently been rebound with red silk.
</P>
<P>
   The show ends with the Tang dynasty, 618 to 906 A.D., an
effervescent, expansive era. Its cosmopolitan spirit is evident in
examples of Buddhist art, a foreign import, and in painted clay
statuettes of mounted riders, male and female. Each is a
near-caricatural sketch of the non-native people who filled the
Tang cities, adding to the multicultural dynamo that China has
always been.
</P>
<P>
   Taken from start to finish, ``The Golden Age of Chinese
Archaeology'' is an eventful trip. But with so many aspects of
Chinese art crying out for elucidation (it's amazing how much we
don't know about the function and meaning of ancient material), how
helpful is such a show?
</P>
<P>
   International exhibitions on this scale are geared to be many
things: crowd-pleasers and good-will advertisements for nations,
corporate sponsors and institutions. But they should also be major
opportunities for advancing knowledge, bringing scholarly minds,
far-flung materials and challenging ideas together in ways that can
radically alter how a culture is seen.
</P>
<P>
   The pocket-survey of Chu material embedded within the National
Gallery show, and last season's ``Edo: Art in Japan, 1615-1868'' at
the same museum, prove that focused exhibitions of unfamiliar
material can be visually smashing, intellectually stimulating and
enormous fun. Our major museums are the only ones in a position to
bankroll such enterprises. The Washington showcase of Chinese work,
which must have cost a bundle, is highly diverting, and often more
than that. But now it's time for some grown-up exhibitions of this
very grown-up art.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Golden Age of Chinese Archaeology: Celebrated Discoveries
from the People's Republic of China'' opens on Sunday and remains
at the National Gallery of Art, Fourth Street at Constitution
Avenue, NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, through Jan. 2. The
exhibition, sponsored by Eastman Kodak Co., travels to the Museum
of Fine Arts in Houston (Feb. 13-May 7) and the Asian Art Museum in
San Francisco (June 17-Sept. 11).

CLARK STILL MAKING THE CASE FOR EFFECTIVENESS OF NATO BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Gen. Wesley K. Clark, NATO's supreme allied
commander, ended the bombing of Yugoslavia more than three months
ago. But this week he was still waging a high-intensity battle to
convince allied public opinion that the bombing had been as
effective in Kosovo as he said it was in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by almost a squadron of allied military pilots and about
20 linear feet of secret bound folders of bomb-damage assessment
reports, he took his campaign to the stage of a NATO news-briefing
auditorium here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In his presentation, Clark produced evidence to counter
suggestions from several sources that the allied command had
exaggerated or deliberately distorted claims of damage to Serbian
military and police forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We destroyed enough'' he summed up. ``The conflict ended on
NATO's terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. John Corley of the U.S. Air Force, chief of an allied
assessment team that went to Kosovo after the Serbian forces had
pulled out, said exhaustive investigations had led to the
conclusion that actual damage was almost what pilot reports had
thought it had been in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Corley said that allied planes from the United States, France,
Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and other countries had hit 93
Serbian tanks and that 26 of those strikes were considered
``catastrophic kills,'' with wreckage found on the ground by his
team.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs had asserted, and some western news organizations had
reported, that just 13 tanks had been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Corley said the assessment team had concluded that 153 armored
combat vehicles, 339 other military trucks and transports and 389
artillery pieces and mortars had been hit and badly damaged, if not
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The figures were not that far off those given by Clark when the
bombs stopped falling in June. He estimated then that 110 tanks,
210 armored fighting vehicles and 449 artillery pieces had been
struck. Thursday, his assessment was that the bombing had put out
of action more than a quarter of the 350 tanks, a third of the 430
armored combat vehicles and more than half the 600 to 750 heavy and
light cannon, anti-aircraft guns and other heavy weapons that the
allies believed Serbian forces had in Kosovo during the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   As he and the pilots did earlier this week here for NATO
ambassadors and senior military officials, Clark and his briefers
produced pictures and videos to show that the withdrawing Serbian
forces had dragged off many damaged tanks and other heavy equipment
for possible salvage.
</P>
<P>
   And despite earlier reports that the Serbs had flummoxed allied
pilots who were flying at 15,000 feet with scores of clever
cardboard and plastic tank and artillery decoys on the ground, the
generals said NATO fliers were well aware of Serbian deception
tactics and had hit nine tank decoys and 16 other mock-ups of other
heavy weapons.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But for a military commander who presided over a 78-day mission
that produced not a single allied casualty in combat and achieved
the aim of allowing hundreds of thousands of Kosovo Albanian
refugees to return home after the Serbian forces had been driven
out of the province, Clark seemed surprisingly on the defensive,
perhaps because political leaders in allied capitals have been
asking how effective the bombing really was since it ended.
</P>
<P>
   Early this summer, he got an unpleasant surprise when the
Pentagon and the White House announced that he would be moved aside
two months early, next April, to make room for his successor, Gen.
Joseph W. Ralston of the Air Force, vice chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs,
confirmed that the British general in charge of NATO forces in
Kosovo had rejected an order from Clark to send in tanks and
armored personnel carriers to seize the Pristina airfield from
Russian troops who occupied it in June. The Russians were staking
out a claim there to participate in operations .
</P>
<P>
   Clark would not comment Thursday on that incident. Instead, he
confined most of his answers to questions about the effectiveness
of the bombing of Serbian forces in Kosovo, even while dismissing
``bean counting'' of targets destroyed as a flawed indicator of
success in the bombing campaign. The ultimate measure of that, he
said, was the Serbian pullout.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the bombing have often pointed out, however, that
before that occurred, allied air power had been unable to prevent
Serbian paramilitary forces and the police from systematically
laying waste to scores of villages in Kosovo, killing thousands of
civilians and driving out hundreds of thousands of others.
</P>
<P>
   A planner of the bombing campaign, Col. Edward Boyle, said
Thursday: ``Only 50 percent of the flying days were good weather.
It was not a perfect world out there.''
</P>
<P>
   And allied concern about inadvertently causing civilian
casualties by high-altitude bombing led commanders to call off many
attacks after Albanian refugees died in an air attack on Serbian
forces who had mixed in with them in a road convoy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Phil Haun, an Air Force A-10 pilot based in Germany who
flew 25 missions in Kosovo, said, ``The Serbs reacted to everything
we did. There were peaks and valleys. Our actual tactics evolved
over the period, but the Serbs were very smart on the ground and on
how we engaged them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark declined to say whether he thought that targeting Serbian
forces in Kosovo was as important or more important than the
strategic bombing of power plants, radio stations, military
headquarters and other key installations inside Serbia itself in

NATO's demands.

   ``Every single mission is documented,'' Clark said. ``All the
lessons learned in this campaign have to be approached from the
point of view that NATO achieved what it set out to do.''

`SUGAR TOWN': A LOS ANGELES SNAPSHOT OF ASHRAMS AND AMBITION 
</HEADLINE>
 ( Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af) 
By JANET MASLIN  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One night, not long after having had her chakra unblocked by a
good-looking therapist, a hilariously Type A film production
designer named Liz (Ally Sheedy) meets the guy fixing the wheat
grass machine at the health food store. When they go out on a date,
she tries to figure out whether his career prospects are any better
than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this like a resting place for you?'' Liz asks sweetly.
``That's not a judgmental question.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, when it's time for the good night clinch, he says ``I'm
not sure it's appropriate for the first date, but ...'' Liz closes
her eyes and puckers her lips. But instead of a kiss she gets an
envelope full of head shots of her companion, who turns out to be
an aspiring actor. ``Seeing as you meet so many directors and
all,'' he explains, and that is hardly the end of it. Not much
later in ``Sugar Town,'' the same user wants Liz to provide a
reference for him when he rents a condo.
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy to pick a favorite character in this knowing,
warmly funny Los Angeles ensemble film, although Ms. Sheedy's
performance as the high-strung embodiment of every known self-help
fad is hard to beat. But all the actors in this nimble comedy
directed by Allison Anders (``Gas Food Lodging'') and Kurt Voss
share the same amusingly jaundiced view of show business, and of
its own special brands of back-stabbing and striving.
</P>
<P>
   Creating a lovingly etched set of characters who are variously
on the ways up or down, and who can never stop obsessing about the
difference, Ms. Anders and Voss shot their film in only three weeks
and successfully caught lightning in a bottle. The use of friends'
houses and clothes contributes to the gratifying indie spirit here,
but best of all is the spontaneity.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The actors in this Altmanish weaving of stories play their
roles with obvious zeal. And many of them happen to be very
familiar with this comic terrain.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of ``Sugar Town'' centers on a group of aging rock stars
who look like the real thing. (And they should: the group is played
most amusingly by John Taylor of Duran Duran, Martin Kemp of
Spandau Ballet and Michael Des Barres, whose ex-wife Pamela wrote
the book on California groupiedom.) Clive (Taylor) still has
die-hard groupies at the doorstep he shares with Eva (Rosanna
Arquette), a once-hot tamale of an actress who has just auditioned
for the role of Christina Ricci's mother.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Perfectly in keeping with the spirit of the film is the scene
in which a woman from an ashram arrives with a son she claims is
Clive's. Even though she and Clive have matching tattoos, he claims
not to remember her. Then she abandons the boy, who wears ghoul
makeup, thinks he's a lot cooler than his father and hates being
called Nirvana. He prefers Nerve.
</P>
<P>
   Only in Los Angeles would this happy family coexist with a
Topanga Canyon guitarist and pig farmer (John Doe), who has a
pregnant wife and a brother known as ``Uncle Rick the Junkie,'' or
with Gwen (Jade Gordon), the new housekeeper who's busy doing an
``All About Eve'' job on Liz.
</P>
<P>
   As played by the attention-getting Ms. Gordon with wonderful
guile, Gwen starts her climb by persuading Liz to wear a smock on a
date with a record producer (Larry Klein, a real producer), then
snagging the man herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're just too funny,'' she coos at him. ``Just a guy who
hates pretense,'' he replies. That's the kind of sweet talk that
gives this wise little comedy its name.

COULD PSYCHIATRIC HELP HAVE AVOIDED THE CHURCH SHOOTINGS?

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Should anyone have been concerned about mass killer Larry Gene
Ashbrook, whom neighbors described as a social outcast and who
wrote letters filled with unusual claims and references to serial
killings?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, mental health professionals say, is yes, no and
maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at what happened, everybody's light goes on and
says, `We missed that; we really didn't even think of it,' '' said
Dr. Saundra Gilfillan, assistant professor of psychiatry at the
University of Texas-Southwestern Medical School in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do think of it more with kids now because of all the school
shootings,'' said Gilfillan, medical director of the Parkland
Health System's psychiatric services. ``But neighbors or
acquaintances don't usually think of it with adults. In hindsight,
it probably wouldn't have been unreasonable to think someone should
have helped him find a psychiatric evaluation.''
</P>
<P>
   But how?
</P>
<P>
   Lauralee Harris, executive director of the Mental Health
Association of Tarrant County, which serves Fort Worth, said it is
often hard to tell when people need help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most mentally ill people are not problematic,'' said Harris.
``They say things that don't make a great deal of sense or do
things we wouldn't do. However, sometimes people are so obviously
over that line that they clearly need help from neighbors and
friends and family.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris said that, if someone is extremely depressed, talking
about suicide or hurting others, police should be called and the
person's statements should not be challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe a person is suicidal or dangerous, absolutely
call the police,'' Harris said. ``A 911 call is very appropriate.
We suggest if it's someone you don't know well, don't try to
challenge their beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Tarrant County, Mental Health-Mental Retardation can do a
crisis response, but a person's got to be very, very ill,'' she
said. ``From what I'm hearing, I don't know if a crisis team would
have responded (to Ashbrook's behavior.) It seemed like he was
functioning and getting out.''
</P>
<P>
   Churches sometimes attract those with mental illness, who may be
reaching out for help, the professionals said. Ministers said that
is a concern for churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We greet everyone who comes to our church with a warm
welcome,'' First Baptist Church pastor Charles Wade said. ``If our
ushers and greeters detect some anxiety or frustration on the part
of the visitor who comes, we seek to minister to them gently and
firmly as needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A church cannot allow itself to take on a siege mentality,''
he said. ``We will not fence people out and thereby fence ourselves
in. God's people must always be vulnerable, but they must also be
careful. We try to do both.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Hearon, associate director of programs of the Mental Health
Association of Greater Dallas, said that as a licensed professional
therapist she is required to call police if she believes someone is
suicidal or homicidal.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for John Q. Public, that's a hard call in today's world,''
she said. ``We can't predict behavior, especially if mental illness
is involved.''
</P>
<P>
   .MDNM/ As development director of Mental Health Association of
Colorado, Michelle Hoffer dealt with the aftermath of the shootings
at Columbine High School. She said that her agency has tried to
focus on prevention and intervention for those with mental illness
and at risk of suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to do because there was so much emotion,'' Hoffer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Several education programs were developed, many geared towards
suicide and depression, including a speakers bureau and brown-bag
talks for corporations on conflict management, suicide and grief. A
separate program was developed for middle- and high-school
students, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a huge response,'' Hoffer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But every time we hear about these shootings, we cringe
because we wonder whether it will reduce or add to the stigma of
mental illness,'' she said. ``We hope it's an opportunity for us to
get the word out that mental illness is treatable.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilfillan said that the Wedgwood shootings should serve to
heighten awareness about mental illness, and suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best we can hope for is to teach people about suicide, and
suicide potential, and maybe we should be looking and listening in
a different way,'' she said. ``This will make us keenly aware of it
for right now. It will go away, but it will rear its head again.
It's a societal dilemma that probably has not run its course yet.''

 &HT;    During the storm season, it helps to think low-tech
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sometimes it takes a hurricane to remind us of who we
can trust when the lights go out.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine for a moment that your telephone and electrical service
are out.
</P>
<P>
   Want to know what the Weather Channel is saying about the
hurricane? Unless you have a laptop computer and a wireless modem,
you're out of luck.
</P>
<P>
   You can type www.weather.com until the moon is blue and nothing
will happen.
</P>
<P>
   And that cable modem of yours? It's a rather ugly little box
sitting by that equally worthless big screen TV. The power of
technology _ for most of us _ is literally gone with the wind at
times like that.
</P>
<P>
   Even battery-powered cell phones and pagers depend on being in
range of a transmitting cell (and if you own either, you've almost
certainly found a ``dead zone'' or two, storm or no storm). And if
the wind gets strong enough and knocks down a few cell sites, then
things will be even worse.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, that transistor radio _ the one you bought
for $11.95 down at Target _ cranks right up. Spin the dial and
you'll find some of the best weather information available.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of fancy radar maps and streaming video images of guys
with good haircuts standing in the rain, you'll hear calm, deep
voices from local radio stations telling you where to go if the
roof just blew off your house, what roads are closed, how to
contact your insurance agent and when to pack up the family and
start running for safety.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, once you have the weather information you need, there's
something soothing about listening to a little music while the wind
blows.
</P>
<P>
   If you set great stock in those MP3 music clips you've been
downloading from the Internet, then you're in for a real surprise.
You just tune in to an oldies station and listen.
</P>
<P>
   I know this seems pretty obvious to you now. But how ready are
you for the next time the lights go out at your house?
</P>
<P>
   At times like that, most of us find that our logical skills and
memory are on par with that of a river otter. So now _ while you
are thinking clearly and the sky is a friendly blue _ take a moment
to assemble a home survival kit.
</P>
<P>
   First on our list are flashlights. Get several good ones and
make sure that you keep them supplied with fresh batteries. Now
stash them in several easy-to-find locations around the house.
After all, the rest of the kit that we assemble will be worthless
if you can't find it in the dark. (Keeping batteries tightly sealed
in a Ziploc bag placed in the refrigerator slightly extends their
life, by the way).
</P>
<P>
   Make one of the flashlights you buy a rechargeable one and keep
it plugged in to the AC power.
</P>
<P>
   Now add a transistor radio. If you can afford it, get one that
receives audio from television stations as well as the regular AM
and FM broadcast bands. You won't have any trouble finding a good
one for $40 or $50.
</P>
<P>
   While you are at the store, buy some candles. That way, even if
a storm never takes away your electrical power, you can turn down
the lights on purpose and have a romantic dinner with someone you
care about. If your companion is smart, they'll be impressed to be
around someone who knows enough about technology to use candles.

SCHROEDER LAYS FISCAL BLAME AT THE FEET OF HIS FOES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Bitterly blaming his Christian Democratic opponents for
driving the country into debt, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said
Thursday that Germany could no longer ``devour the resources that
should nourish our children.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the Reichstag that amounted to an impassioned
attempt to shore up his political position after crushing defeats
for his party in three state elections, Schroeder said there was no
alternative to proposed budget cuts of $16 billion that are meant
to reshape Europe's largest economy.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing an accusing finger at Christian Democrats, who governed
Germany from 1982 to 1998, Schroeder, a Social Democrat, said:
``You brought the country to the brink of ruin with your fiscal
policies. You are responsible for the fact that we are paying an
annual interest burden of 82 billion marks'' _ $45 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It was a speech full of theatrical gestures and crescendos, a
far cry from the normally inhibited style of the chancellor, and it
brought thunderous applause from most of the Social Democrats in
the Reichstag. But whether the speech could reverse the plunge in
Schroeder's support in the country was far from clear.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As the chancellor spoke, tensions that surfaced from the
electoral defeats were underscored when Rudolf Scharping, the
defense minister, said reports that he had an eye on Schroeder's
job were baseless.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative daily Die Welt ran a front-page article
Thursday saying Schroeder had been angered by Scharping's clear
ambitions and by his support of soldiers who have been
demonstrating against the military cuts that form part of the
proposed austerity program.
</P>
<P>
   The report, not the first to suggest that the defense minister
sees himself as a possible replacement for Schroeder, said the
chancellor had decided to ``get rid'' of Scharping, as he disposed
of Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Scharping responded in a statement saying: ``My position is
clear and dependable. Part of this clarity and dependability is
that I support the chancellor.'' But the minister is known to have
rejected an offer earlier this year to become NATO secretary
general, in part because he sees opportunities at home.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder has been attacked by the Christian Democrats, unions
and members of his own party for proposing to slash ministerial
budgets by an average of 7 percent, to freeze pensions in real
terms until 2001 and to hold down welfare payments. But he now
seems determined to push for a less state-dependent economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, it pains me when friends from labor unions
criticize me harshly,'' Schroeder said. ``But even with close
friends, the public good must sometimes take precedence over
individual interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The words reflected the chancellor's clear decision that he must
project the image of the responsible statesman after a year of
policy zig-zags. He described the recent electoral defeats as
``very painful,'' but said they would not deter him.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the country's vast debt, as most Germans are aware,
stems from the enormous cost of unification, which any German
government would have been obliged to pay, at least in some
measure.
</P>
<P>
   But the budget crisis has also been fueled by Germany's failure
to follow countries like the Netherlands and Sweden in reforming
its social security system and rigid labor market. High
unemployment _ still affecting over 4 million people and over 10
percent of the workforce _ has become a chronic scourge.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wolfgang Schaeuble, the leader of the Christian Democrats,
rejected suggestions that his party should be blamed for the
economic difficulties, describing Schroeder's first year in office
as ``a lost year, and not only for the unemployed in Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on: ``You reduce allocations for research, education and
investment and you call that a program for the future? Savings are
necessary _ that is unquestionable. But you have chosen the wrong
way. You divide and destabilize, and the result is stagnation and
resignation, instead of courage to face the future.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, both politicians appeared to have a point: Helmut Kohl
was no prince of fiscal rectitude, and Schroeder's first year in
office seems to have been largely squandered. As a result, the
long-debated shift toward a more entrepreneurial, nimbler German
economy has never occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Schroeder has the personal strength and party support to
make such changes is unclear. What seems certain is that he will
face more election pain in Saxony and Berlin in the next few weeks
_ as well as criticisms from Lafontaine in a potentially explosive
book to be published next month _ before any eventual revival of
his fortunes.

A ROCKER PRACTICING THE POWER OF NEGATIVE THINKING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 19) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the novel ``Great Jones Street,'' Don DeLillo defined a rock
star as ``one man imparting an erotic terror to the dreams of the
republic.'' The only 1990s rocker to live up to that billing has
been Trent Reznor, who records as Nine Inch Nails.
</P>
<P>
   On the albums and EP ``Pretty Hate Machine'' (1989), ``Broken''
(1992) and ``The Downward Spiral'' (1994), Reznor crawled inside
the mind-set of a psychotic loner who could calmly intone:
``Nothing can stop me now/I don't care anymore.'' In ``Head Like a
Hole,'' he vowed, ``I'd rather die than give you control''; he
probed the sacred and profane sexual impulse in ``Closer.''
</P>
<P>
   Blurting out alienation and thwarted rage, Nine Inch Nails songs
provided defiant sing-alongs for fans and obvious targets for the
censorious.
</P>
<P>
   With Reznor playing nearly every instrument, the music throbbed
and blared and insinuated. It merged the pitiless beat of
industrial rock with the guitar attack of heavy metal, sometimes
dropping to a dire murmur, often adding enough melody to make the
songs reach beyond the rock audience's head-banging fringe.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't rule anything out: Beatles harmonies, a disco beat,
punk-rock tremolos, a primal howl. With the psychological expertise
of a horror-film soundtracker and a willingness to wield ugly
sounds in precise doses, Reznor became the auteur of the foreboding
and the grotesque.
</P>
<P>
   The ominous tone still dominates ``The Fragile.'' But on the new
album, it's bye-bye, blasphemy and so long, sex and drugs and S&AMP;M.
Reznor's adolescent concerns, the ones that put black NIN stickers
on the lockers of high school students both sensitive and
belligerent, are receding; maybe he has bequeathed them to his
onetime (and now estranged) protege Marilyn Manson, who's still
eager to court notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   Reznor has lost interest in easy sensationalism and standard
taboos, and he's no longer fighting psychological battles with
authority figures. Instead, he has decided to stare down his most
relentless tormentor: himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fragile'' (Nothing/Interscope 0694904732), the first Nine
Inch Nails album in five years, is a desperate identity crisis
rendered in symphonic scale: two CDs lasting 104 minutes, with 17
songs and six instrumentals. It's an immersion in negative
expectations, a passage toward an ever more encompassing solitude.
</P>
<P>
   Over the length of the album, every possible support _ friends,
faith, love, his own stubborn persistence _ shatters when the
singer needs it most. ``Thought he lost everything/Then he lost a
whole lot more,'' Reznor whispers over clatters and thumps and a
subdued bass undertow in ``I'm Looking Forward to Joining You,
Finally.''
</P>
<P>
   Although its lyrics never offer specifics, ``The Fragile'' could
be decoded as an album about the struggle to make the album itself.
It can also, however, stand as a cycle of songs about one man's
reaction to betrayal, loneliness and insurmountable depression.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in its music, the album's sense of isolation mirrors the
situation of a one-man studio band, like Reznor, trying to stave
off his self-doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fragile'' is clearly an artifact of obsessive studio toil.
Every nanosecond of sound has been painstakingly sharpened and
barbed. Nine Inch Nails has always used jolting dynamics, corrosive
vocals and serrated timbres.
</P>
<P>
   But on ``The Fragile,'' Reznor and his co-producer, Alan
Moulder, don't simply bludgeon the songs. They open up the music
the way Damien Hirst's sculptures _ like his full-size slices of
cows in transparent cases _ open up anatomy. Reznor is less and
less inclined to imitate the sound of a live band with guitars,
keyboards, bass and drums playing their usual roles.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangements on ``The Fragile'' are more erratic; they slip
rhythmic gears, they wrangle from within, they suddenly shift
volume and perspective.
</P>
<P>
   The first song on the album, ``Somewhat Damaged,'' is a
typically unstable contraption. It starts with a repeating
four-note line on acoustic guitar, answered by an insistently
dissonant note from the other speaker; stop-start drums turn the
beat around; a fast electronic pulse chatters in the midrange; a
simple vocal line sits across the four-note line, which moves to
nastier electric guitar.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are volleys of staggered percussion sounds; the pulse
leaps from instrument to instrument; Reznor's voice grows frazzled
and furious as he pronounces himself ``poison to my rotten core.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of pointillism is only one of Nine Inch Nails'
strategies on ``The Fragile.'' There are straightforward hard-rock
thrashers and sustained processionals, beats like slow hip-hop and
zinging techno riffs. Reznor chants simple, repeating lines while
the music ricochets all around him, or he gathers voices and
instruments for big, old-fashioned rock choruses, then goes on to
vandalize them.
</P>
<P>
   All over the album, acoustic and electronic sounds are processed
beyond recognition. Instruments writhe in and out of tune; static
and distortion are calibrated and layered until they become rhythm
as well as noise. The arrangements change restlessly through every
song, rising and collapsing, taking on heft and then fracturing
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Riffs slip quietly into the mix, then detonate, and power chords
slam into the foreground, then drop away like trapdoors. The music
never finds secure ground. But it rarely stumbles, either. Reznor's
worst misstep is to let the pianist Mike Garson fling too many of
the clusters he has been adding to rock records since he appeared
on David Bowie's 1973 ``Aladdin Sane.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, ``The Fragile'' finds glimmers of human connection.
Early on the first disk, ``We're in This Together'' gives the
singer an inseparable lover as he insists, ``We will make it
through somehow,'' although frenzied, distortion-laced guitars
snarl of impending disaster.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Please,'' he begs, ``Will you please complete me?'' only to
realize that his partner will never be enough. The album's title
song, a stately, slow-building ballad, praises a fragile woman who
``shines in a world full of ugliness,'' and the singer promises,
``I won't let you fall apart.'' But as they seek ``the perfect
place,'' over burbling ``Strawberry Fields'' keyboards, the
accompaniment turns sour, dissonant, paranoid. The idyll can't
last.
</P>
<P>
   More conventionally, a few songs lash out at show business
bloodsuckers and sycophants, including one that's obviously a
parting shot at Marilyn Manson. But the old Nine Inch Nails spite
and irritability no longer ring as true as the songs that own up to
frailty, self-loathing and perseverance despite it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no place I can hide/It feel like it keeps coming from
the inside,'' Reznor rasps as he's buffeted by discordant bass
double-stops and synthetic buzzes and zaps in ``The Big Come
Down.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``The Fragile,'' the singer never finds a way out of his
misery. Then again, he doesn't approach suicide as he did on ``The
Downward Spiral.'' All he can do is endure and observe, fighting
his own fears to a stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   While he does that, luckily, Reznor can hide in the studio and
piece together music that's as cunning, and disquieting, as his raw
anger used to be.

IN SUICIDE NOTE, FORMER OFFICIAL BLAMES PRESIDENT FOR DEATH OF HIS
BROTHER
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: This was added to A1 as a boxed reefer.) 
(sw) 
 By TIM GOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a last, bitter attack on the political system he
once served, a former Mexican justice official who apparently
killed himself on Wednesday rather than face money laundering
charges in the United States blamed President Ernesto Zedillo for
both his own death and the assassination of his brother.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Ruiz Massieu asserted in a suicide note that was made
public on Thursday by his widow that Zedillo never forgave his
criticism of governing party officials after his brother,
JoseFrancisco, a party leader, was shot to death in Mexico City in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took revenge for that,'' Ruiz Massieu, a former deputy
attorney general, wrote of the Mexican president. ``To find the
killers of my brother, an investigation must be undertaken that
starts with Zedillo.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz Massieu offered no evidence to support his assertions. One
of his American lawyers, Cathy Fleming, suggested that some
information that Ruiz Massieu had never disclosed would be made
public ``at an appropriate time.'' But the Mexican attorney general
quickly dismissed the letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the voice of a psychopath who is about to take
his own life,'' the attorney general, Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, said
in Mexico City. ``Mario Ruiz Massieu lived telling lies and he died
telling lies.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in her Manhattan offices less than 24 hours
after Ruiz Massieu was found unconscious in the New Jersey
apartment where he had been under house arrest, Ms. Fleming denied
earlier reports that he had feared being jailed in Houston, where
he was to have appeared in federal district court on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he just got tired,'' she said. ``He didn't have the
fight anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   In the long, legal struggle that began when he fled Mexico in
March 1994, Ruiz Massieu had overcome four different attempts by
the United States to extradite him to Mexico to face charges there
that included graft, money laundering and the abuse of his
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials said he had acted to undermine the
investigation he led into the murder of his brother, so as to hide
the role of Raul Salinas de Gortari, a brother of Mexico's former
president, in ordering the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz Massieu had also survived a civil money laundering trial in
1997, after which the authorities seized nearly all of a $9 million
fortune he had secreted in Texas banks. Federal prosecutors
asserted that Ruiz Massieu, who led Mexico's anti-drug efforts at
the end of the administration of former President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari, had taken bribes from some of the country's biggest drug
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ruiz Massieu had long been treated for depression and
was facing the most serious case yet made against him, his widow,
Maria Eugenia, said she had had no inkling that he had grown
desperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never knew anything,'' she said, standing stoically before a
line of television cameras in Ms. Fleming's Manhattan offices.
``Our life was always normal and happy. He never showed anything.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Ruiz Massieu never much resembled the man that
court files finally described.
</P>
<P>
   An ambitious, tightly wound lawyer, he had served in a long
series of government posts, including two stints as a deputy
attorney general and one as Mexico's ambassador to Denmark. He also
wrote a series of books, including one entitled, ``The Legal
Framework for the Combat of Drug Trafficking.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said an autopsy would be performed on Ruiz Massieu on
Friday, but that a toxicological report on the medication on which
he apparently overdosed could take days to complete. Ruiz Massieu,
however, left little doubt that he had decided to end his own life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is I and only I who decides when to end my life in order to
recover freedom,'' he wrote. ``The killers are they who have taken
it away from me.''

 &HT;    From runways to runaways: Fashion Week rained out
 &HT;    By Scott Walton
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Manhattan was at its calmest and craziest Thursday as
it cowered under the eye of the storm.
</P>
<P>
   When Mayor Rudolph Giuliani issued the order for schools and
businesses to close and people to go home no later than 3 p.m., it
was heeded. But New Yorkers did not go easily into the night.
</P>
<P>
   There were intervals when the din of police and fire sirens
pierced the soggy air. And then there were stretches of time when
the usual honking of horns in stalled traffic ceased, leaving
nothing but the hiss of drizzle.
</P>
<P>
   One minute, you saw cabbies and motorists jockeying for position
and exchanging profane gestures in Times Square. The next, you saw
people with resigned looks of hopelessness trying to hail taxis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's typical New York,'' said a stranded Bill Lasche, vice
president of product and trend direction of the Birmingham,
Ala.-based Saks Inc. ``I don't mean that in a negative way. But
wouldn't you know this would happen during Fashion Week, when all
these designers had put so much effort into producing their
shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Saks Inc. fashion director Arlene Goldstein had checked out of
her Manhattan hotel as well only to find her flight back to
Birmingham had been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those poor designers will never get back the momentum they had
going this week,'' Goldstein sighed.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Fashion Week's governing body, 7th on Sixth, was forced
to announce the cancellation of the bulk of its runway show
schedule Thursday due to the mayor's weather emergency
pronouncement. The hope was to reschedule those pre-empted shows on
Saturday, when most of the editors from out of town had planned to
depart.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation swirled around Fashion Week's headquarters, The Tent
at Bryant Park, as to whether the maverick British designer
Alexander McQueen would go ahead and stage his spring/summer 2000
show on the Hudson River's Chelsea Pier late Thursday night,
regardless of the weather. (At 3 p.m., an hour before the brunt of
the storm was expected to hit Manhattan, a publicist for McQueen
answered the phone and said he would.)
</P>
<P>
   Though New York's news outlets had taken great pains all week to
track Hurricane Floyd's path up the Eastern seaboard, the storm
still caught the clothing industry by surprise. Those attending
Bill Blass' farewell collection preview had to contend with The
Tent's leaking roof and two inches of standing water. And, horror
of all horrors, Vogue editor Anna Wintour showed up IN THE SAME
PLAID PLASTIC PONCHO four or five others had also received as
welcome-to-town gifts from Burberry's.
</P>
<P>
   All day long, the news station New York One cautioned viewers
against driving and forecast flood warnings and wind gusts of up to
50 mph. A polo-shirted Giuliani, who said 911 calls had doubled in
volume, was shown cautioning city residents. ``We're dealing with a
very serious storm,'' he said. ``You can hopefully avoid any fatal
danger. But you cannot avoid any inconvenience.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Millennium Hotel on Times Square, doorman Adrian
Green kept order among those waiting for cabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen it all today,'' Green said in a deep Carribean
accent. ``You've just got to roll with the punches. I'm standing
here with my feet all wet, but I don't want to let the guests know
it bothers me.''
</P>
<P>
   And were guests tipping any better than usual given the
circumstances?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we do not discuss,'' Green said cordially.
``For all I know, you're with the IRS.''
</P>
<P>
   When Amoc Dixit's turn at the cabstand finally came, the
Minnesotan ran for it like it was the last lifeboat off the
Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wanna know what this is like?'' Dixit asked over his
shoulder. ``It's so bad I have to take a train down to Philadelphia
just to catch a plane back home.

AT&AMP;T AND BRITISH TELECOM PLAN GLOBAL WIRELESS LINK
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Corp. and British Telecommunications PLC Thursday said they
would expand their global communications alliance by linking their
wireless telephone operations around the world.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, the biggest communications company in the United States,
and British Telecom, the biggest phone company in Britain, are
already trying to create a $10 billion joint venture to serve the
international communications needs of multinational corporations.
</P>
<P>
   While the new wireless alliance would not technically be part of
that venture, its formation underscores the growing importance of
wireless as part of the comprehensive communications package that
carriers around the globe are trying to build.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mobile market has been a country-by-country market,''
Sohail Qadri, British Telecom's director for wireless services,
said. ``We have been trying to grow our mobile capability around
the world. What's happening now is that there are some global
drivers beginning to emerge in a significant way that make this
sort of deal make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   New wireless alliances appear to make sense to others as well.
Bell Atlantic Corp., one of the regional Bell telephone giants, is
trying to negotiate a deal to combine its U.S. wireless operations
with those of Vodafone Airtouch PLC of Britain, the world's biggest
wireless carrier.
</P>
<P>
   The two deals, however, seem quite different. While Vodafone and
Bell Atlantic appear to be negotiating to create a new
joint-venture company, AT&AMP;T and British Telecom's pact appears
significantly less extensive, representing a cooperation agreement
between the two companies rather than the creation of a new one. No
money will change hands and Qadri said that AT&AMP;T and British
Telecom would not unify the core brands of their wireless services.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the new AT&AMP;T-British Telecom alliance, to be called
Advance, would be a wireless behemoth, with 41 million customers in
17 countries. Together, the two companies' wireless operations
generate about $12 billion in annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the money they take in, AT&AMP;T's and British Telecom's
wireless operations generally use different technologies, as do
many wireless carriers from different parts of the world. That
diversity of wireless technology has generally prevented most U.S.
wireless customers from ``roaming'' to and using their phones in
other countries. As part of their new pact, AT&AMP;T and British
Telecom will attempt to develop trans-Atlantic roaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you travel, you expect your B.T. or AT&AMP;T digital phone to
work anywhere and everywhere with all of the advanced features you
have, just as if you were at home,'' John D. Zeglis, AT&AMP;T's
president, said in a statement. ``This is not possible in many
cases today for a whole host of reasons, including incompatible
technology and government regulation. By pairing two of the leading
telecommunications companies in the world, AT&AMP;T and B.T., we think
we can make some things happen that will eventually give customers
those `anytime, anywhere' capabilities from their mobile phones.''
</P>
<P>
   Qadri said that next year the two companies intended to
introduce trans-Atlantic roaming in a way that would let users keep
their phone numbers even when traveling to different countries.
Those users, however, would have to use two phones because of the
different technologies used in different countries.
</P>
<P>
   By 2001, though, the companies intend to offer international
roaming using a single handset, Qadri said, using technology AT&AMP;T
and British Telecom are developing with Motorola Inc. and Siemens
AG of Germany. Such capabilities are already offered by many
smaller U.S. wireless operators that employ the wireless technology
used in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Such services would be useful for tourists, but the main
objective of the new pact, as in most areas of international
telecommunications, is the multinational corporate client. AT&AMP;T and
British Telecom want to offer big companies with wireless users in
many countries unified billing and perhaps cross-border discounts,
and it could be cheaper for the two carriers to develop those
services together rather than separately.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a need to develop products and services and share
risks across more than one market,'' Qadri said. ``The cost of
developing billing systems, customer service systems and so on is
becoming more and more expensive and you need to be able to share
those costs across a bigger customer base.''
</P>
<P>
   John Bensche, a wireless analyst at Lehman Brothers, said: ``I
think what they're trying to do here is to put together a
compelling selling proposition when they go selling to
multinational companies. They want to offer a wireless check-off
box in addition to their other services.''

CHURCH SHOOTINGS REKINDLE GUN-LAW DEBATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
and JAY ROOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The shootings at Wedgwood Baptist Church reignited a national
debate over gun control Thursday, but the usual passions were
cooled by the numbing realization that the unthinkable had happened
again.
</P>
<P>
   After a season of carnage that began with the April 20 shootings
at Columbine High School, the latest explosion of violence left
partisans on both sides searching for words to match their
emotions. A high school in Colorado. An office building in Atlanta.
A day-care center in Los Angles. Now a church in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet, again, we have seen a sanctuary violated by gun violence,
taking children brimming with faith and promise and hope before
their time,'' a somber President Clinton said. ``Our nation's
support and prayers are with the families of the victims, those
still suffering in the hospital, and the entire Fort Worth
community.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's stunned disbelief echoed across the country as
Americans grappled with yet another bloody tragedy involving a
troubled person with a gun. Seven people were fatally shot and
seven were wounded Wednesday when Larry Ashbrook, an emotionally
disturbed loner, opened fire during a youth prayer rally.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook, 47, ended the shooting spree by killing himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we go again _ more images of kids who have been
completely traumatized because their friends have been killed in
front of them,'' said Joe Sudbay of Handgun Control Inc. ``These
are not isolated instances anymore. They are becoming almost
commonplace, and that's very scary.''
</P>
<P>
   For North Texas lawmakers, the shootings underscored the
oft-stated truism that violence can occur anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really struck home when I heard the news. I grew up a
couple of miles from there,'' said Rep. Martin Frost, D-Dallas.
``You know it could happen anywhere, and yet you always hope that
it won't happen in your own community.''
</P>
<P>
   Others focused on the fact that the shootings occurred in a
church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence struck in that one place where we should feel most
secure,'' said House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Irving, Texas.
``So long as there are people who have no regard for the sanctity
of life, we will never be safe. Not even in God's house.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in a ritual that has played out all too often this year,
both sides in the gun debate drew sharply different lessons from
the latest tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened because there are far too many guns and there is
far too much access to them in America,'' said Sudbay, a gun
control activist. ``The American people want stricter gun control.
They see the connection.''
</P>
<P>
   But GOP Rep. Joe Barton of Ennis, Texas, a gun rights advocate,
said more laws would not have changed anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who want to do bad things will be able to get
weapons,'' he said. ``If people are going to call for gun control,
why not call for the incarceration of 47-year-old men that are
depressed or call for closing down churches that want to have
public meetings on prayer?''
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth shootings also focused attention on Texas gun
laws. At a time when other states have responded to gun violence by
restricting sales and ownership, the Texas Legislature has
generally gone in the other direction.
</P>
<P>
   After approving a right-to-carry law in 1995, state lawmakers
passed legislation this year protecting gun manufacturers from some
lawsuits seeking damages for gun violence. In 1997, they removed
churches from the list of locations where concealed weapons are
automatically banned.
</P>
<P>
   Texas state Rep. Ray Allen, R-Grand Prairie, co-author of the
right-to-carry law, said the legislation might have helped prevent
Wednesday's tragedy if someone in the church had been armed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A licensed holder might have been able to stop that attack or
at least divert attention until the police officer arrived,'' Allen
said. ``One deranged person with a gun can kill and reload again as
long as he faces no effective opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Suzanna Hupp, R-Lampasas, who survived the 1991
massacre that killed her parents at a Luby's cafeteria in Killeen,
said she sees no connection between the recent gun violence and gun
laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guns are not allowed in public schools, but there have been
shootings at schools. Look at where they are not occurring. There
have been no mass shootings at gun shows or at NRA conventions, yet
these are where the so-called gun nuts congregate,'' she said,
referring to the National Rifle Association. ``Let's get a clue,
folks, and use some brains and common sense on this issue. Let's
get past the emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Attorney General Janet Reno said the Fort Worth
shootings should lead to a re-examination of the national approach
to gun laws, mental health and hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1999 alone, we have watched as innocent people were gunned
down while attending school, while walking home from a church or
synagogue, while playing at a summer camp, while working in their
offices, while delivering mail, and now while worshipping in their
church,'' she said. ``All of these events cry out for America to
come together and to address them in an effective, permanent
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   While cautioning against a rush to judgment about the cause of
the Fort Worth violence, Vice President Al Gore urged Congress to
approve gun control legislation. A House-Senate conference
committee is considering a package of proposals that would require
background checks for all gun show sales, ban high-capacity
ammunition clips and require safety devices for all new guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Families across the country are having a discussion about guns
this morning, and almost every morning, because there are too many
of these tragedies. They didn't occur to this extent before there
was a flood of guns easily available to people,'' Gore said on
ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   But even some of the most ardent gun control advocates
questioned whether the latest violence will change any minds in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress wasn't moved by Columbine. Congress wasn't moved by
what happened in Atlanta. Congress wasn't moved by the shootings in
Los Angeles,'' Sudbay said. ``Is anything going to move Congress to
do something to protect America's kids from firearms?''
</P>
<P>
   NRA lobbyist Gib Lewis, a former Texas House speaker from Fort
Worth, said he will be ready if the shootings prompt efforts to
tighten state gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure if somebody tries to pass some restrictions on
guns,'' Lewis said, ``we will spring into action.'' &QL;

SHOOTINGS DEVASTATE A PICTURE-PERFECT NEIGHBORHOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN AUSTIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Nancy Dragoo was quietly paying bills in her
home office Wednesday evening when she heard hammering on the front
door and opened it to find a frantic woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``She pounded on my door and said, `Call 911, somebody's
shooting up the church,' '' said Dragoo, who lives across the
street from Wedgwood Baptist Church on Wales Avenue. ``I don't know
what I thought, 'cause I couldn't even believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Disbelief was the prevailing sentiment Thursday among residents
on the quiet, shaded street that borders the church where gunfire
left eight dead.
</P>
<P>
   Wales Avenue is the kind of place where people know their
neighbors, mothers hug little kids who live down the street, and
folks invite strangers into their neat, brick, ranch-style houses
for ice water on a hot day.
</P>
<P>
   In short, it's a street that seems better suited to an episode
of ``Leave it to Beaver'' than one where TV satellite trucks cover
a mass killing and CNN crews offer to rent a resident's laundry
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shouldn't have happened here,'' said Cristina Robertson,
17, who has lived on Wales Avenue, a few hundred feet from the
church, most of her life. ``Nothing ever happens here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very close-knit neighborhood,'' she said. ``It's like
something out of a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of her neighbors, Robertson was outside Thursday
morning, surrounded by parents, younger children and teen-age
friends who stayed home from work and school to console one another
and come to grips with their feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's voice shook as she looked toward the church that
looms so large in the neighborhood, and now in the national news.
Robertson was a longtime friend of Justin Ray , who died in the
church.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson was visiting Damon Barnard, another neighbor, on
Thursday. Barnard was standing next to Ray when he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the one who carried him out,'' Robertson said of
Barnard. ``They were ... best friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnard declined to discuss the killings. He stayed in the house
and plugged in the electric bass guitar that he frequently picked
with his Christian-rock band down the street at Wedgwood Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He saw it all,'' said his mother, Anita Barnard. As she spoke,
she put her hand to her mouth and clenched her eyes.
</P>

three police cars raced by the house with their lights on Wednesday

   She jumped into her car and drove half a block, parked, jumped

 &HT;    No mystery: Friedman takes non-P.C. stance
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Politically correct is not a term in Kinky Friedman's
vocabulary. The man who formed a band called the Texas Jewboys and
gained notoriety with such songs as ``Get Your Biscuits in the Oven
and Your Buns in the Bed'' has brought his same irreverent tone to
his series of mystery novels.
</P>
<P>
   His latest, ``Spanking Watson'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $23), is not
likely to win any converts among critics who think the Texan
frequently weaves back and forth across the line of good taste.
</P>
<P>
   Set in New York, the novel revolves around detective Friedman's
(yes, his protagonist is named Kinky Friedman) search for a Dr.
Watson to his Sherlock Holmes. Throw in a lesbian dance class, mock
death threats and real murders, and you have another wacko
whodunit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect everybody to like it,'' Friedman said in a
telephone interview from Houston. ``Americans are the most hung-up
people on the planet _ racially, sexually and politically. We don't
grasp satire and irony very easily. Europeans are much more attuned
to satire. Why is it that Americans don't get it? Maybe we get what
we deserve, and we deserve Dr. Laura and Rush Limbaugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman's books sell well in the United States, but they do
even better in other countries. His novels have been translated
into 16 languages, and young German readers tell him they read his
books in both German and English to teach themselves English.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this shows is there is universal appeal and that the
books are clearly divinely inspired,'' Friedman quipped. ``The Lord
must be writing these books using me as a vessel.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman will sign books at 7 p.m. Sept. 24 at Chapter 11
Discount Books, 1544 Piedmont Ave. 404-872-7986.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Southern accent: The University of Alabama is launching a new
paperback reprint series, Deep South Books, that will spotlight
some of the best writers of the region. Among the first works to be
published are Vicki Covington's ``Gathering Home'' and ``The Last
Hotel for Women'' and Nanci Kincaid's ``Crossing Blood.''
Covington's books are set in the turbulent Civil Rights era in
Alabama, and Kincaid's novel deals with racial and political issues
in 1980s Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ghost writers: The output of dead authors continues to grow.
Following the release of ``McNally's Dilemma,'' written by Vincent
Lardo but with Lawrence Sanders' name prominently displayed on the
cover, Dutton is publishing ``Chain of Command,'' a new cop
thriller by William Caunitz (``One Police Plaza''). The only
problem: Caunitz died in 1996, and nowhere in Dutton's fall catalog
does it mention ``co-author'' Chris Newman.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Literature abroad: Apparently reading tastes in other
countries mirror those of the United States. According to the
newsletter Publishing Trends, Danielle Steel's ``Granny Dan'' is
No. 1 in the United Kingdom, while Mary Higgins Clark's ``We'll
Meet Again'' occupies the top spot in France. Tom Wolfe's ``A Man
in Full'' is No. 4 in India.

 &HT;    It's been a Blass: The dean of U.S. designers says goodbye
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bill Blass said bye-bye to the clothing business
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The 79-year-old designer, who rose from humble beginnings in
Evansville, Ind., to become the darling of women with serious dough
presented his final collection to a crowd so appreciative of his
accomplishments that even hurricane warnings couldn't keep them
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of my swan song, this is more like `Swan Lake',''
Blass said as rain-soaked admirers lined up to offer post-show
congratulations.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably the most influential American designer (he was the
first to market his name in a big way and forever changed the
status of designers), Blass bid his adieu with a bang, not a
whimper. The runway preview of his decidedly dignified
spring/summer 2000 designs was spiced with Lenny Kravitz's raucous
rendition of ``American Woman,'' Stevie Ray Vaughn's ``Pride and
Joy'' and Elvis Presley's ``Jailhouse Rock.'' (The latter
accompanied models strutting in horizontally striped sequined
pants.)
</P>
<P>
   Proving he hasn't lost touch with what's trendy, Blass showed:
pants that rolled seductively around the hips, caressed the thighs
and flared gracefully from the ankle down; an abundance of floral
embroidery up the sides of skirts and dresses and all over his
evening gowns; jackets hemmed at the hip; and outfits awash in
tropical colors (coral, lime green, lemon yellow and sea blue).
</P>
<P>
   He even offered up a few innovations not seen this week: floral
overskirts worn with matching pants, and slit skirts in doubled
layers of contrasting colors.
</P>
<P>
   It was a collection full of the kind of clothes mature women
covet and younger women admire. The suits (embroidered or trimmed
with raffia) were sleek, the frocks (knee- to floor-length)
feminine and the tube tops added a racy twist.
</P>
<P>
   The fastidious designer's farewell was a fond one, however
one-sided.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one Bill Blass,'' said philanthropist Judy
Peabody, one of the many gathered backstage to say their last
good-byes. ``I feel sad about this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the official farewell,'' Blass declared. ``And it's a
great sigh of relief. I'm delighted to be out of this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly won't be traveling in my retirment, because I hate
to travel,'' he added. ``But I will be writing a book. I just need
some time off... I've been doing this for 50 or 60 years and I'm
not going to miss it one bit. I was actually relieved when there
was talk of canceling (the show) due to the weather.''

MEASURE PASSES THAT WOULD GIVE RAISE TO CONGRESS, PRESIDENT

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress Thursday passed and sent to President
Clinton a spending bill that will increase its members' salaries,
as well as those of federal workers and the next president.
</P>
<P>
   The measure contains a $4,600 raise for members of Congress,
increasing their annual incomes to $141,300 a year, a 3.4 percent
raise. The sum is about twice the average lawyer's income and
roughly five times what the average American wage earner makes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to sign the measure, which would increase
congressional salaries in January. It would be the third increase
Congress has given itself in seven years. Lawmakers voted
themselves a raise in January 1998 and in January 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Though conservative lawmakers have opposed raises, federal law
grants members of Congress an annual salary increase unless the
members vote to block it, which they chose to do from 1994 until
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Government workers would receive pay increases next year
averaging 4.8 percent, which would be their biggest increase in pay
in 18 years. The bill would also double the salary paid the
president to $400,000 in January 2001, when Clinton's successor
will be sworn in. That would be the first pay increase for a
president in 32 years.
</P>
<P>
   If the $200,000 salary paid back then to President Richard Nixon
had been adjusted for inflation, it would now be nearly $900,000.
That salary would be about average for a chief executive of one of
the nation's 200 largest corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The salaries of federal judges are usually linked to those paid
to lawmakers. But a House-Senate conference will have to add an
increase if judges are to keep pace with Congress next year.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, the Senate voted 95-0 for a $49.5 billion
transportation bill that increases spending for roads, mass transit
and airports. The House has passed a $50.7 billion measure, and the
two versions must now be reconciled in a House-Senate conference.
</P>
<P>
   The spending bill Congress completed and sent to Clinton
Thursday, a measure financing the Treasury Department and several
smaller agencies, is only the third of 13 annual spending bills
Congress has completed this year. A fourth, financing the District
of Columbia, was finished late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Hope is evaporating that Congress will finish its only required
task _ spending the government's money _ on time. Eight working
days remain for Congress until the 2000 fiscal year begins on Oct.
1.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of obstacles ahead,'' said Rep. C.W. Bill
Young, R-Fla, who heads the House Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Those obstacles include the Republican leadership in Congress,
which has been unable to agree on a strategy to pass this year's
spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   Spending caps imposed by Congress have left the bills about $30
billion shy of what many members think will be needed to finance
favorite programs, win passage and send the bills to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders are considering measures like charging
billions of dollars in emergency agriculture aid that would be
spent in the fiscal year 2000 against the previous year's books,
and delaying billions of dollars in Medicaid payments due to the
states in September 2000, thus charging them against the 2001
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, no money would be saved, but the spending would
not be counted in the coming fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   If the new fiscal year begins on Oct. 1 without spending bills
signed into law, the government must operate on stop-gap bills
called continuing resolutions. That is a fragile architecture, and
if it breaks down in political disarray, a repeat of the government
shutdown of 1995 is possible.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest and most complicated spending bills are in limbo.
The measure financing labor, health and human services has been
drained of billions of dollars to finance other spending bills, and
it has not even been written, much less debated. Congressional
aides said it was increasingly likely that the measure would never
be completed, but instead rolled into an omnibus spending bill that
could be passed in October or November.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Congress passed an omnibus spending bill that
became a 4,000-page behemoth containing $21 billion in additional
spending that violated the caps, or spending limits, that Congress
solemnly imposed on itself in 1997. Unless some magical solution
conceived through creative accounting appears, the same could
happen this year, senior congressional aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in Congress have vowed to keep their hands
off the billions of dollars in surplus Social Security money. But
in an emergency, like an immediate need for disaster relief in the
wake of Hurricane Floyd, they might have to tap that money, said a
senior aide to Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader.

 &HT;    Quiet, please: Theaters get tough on noisy patrons
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Lee
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Faced with increasing complaints about noise during movies, AMC
Theatres is starting to crack down on the offenders.
</P>
<P>
   The chain has begun asking adults not to bring children younger
than 6 into R-rated movies after 6 p.m., and warning that if they
do so, and the child becomes disruptive, they'll be asked to leave.
To sweeten the blow, though, they'll give parents a pass to come
back another time.
</P>
<P>
   In a couple of weeks, AMC will begin attacking another big
irritant by asking patrons to turn off cell phones and beepers
before entering auditoriums. AMC, with nine theaters, is one of the
largest theater operators in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   To spread the word, the Kansas City, Mo.-based company is
posting signs and getting ushers to speak to audiences about the
noise policies before a movie begins. Ushers will also speak
one-on-one with parents bringing in young children.
</P>
<P>
   AMC is testing the increased emphasis on etiquette in its
Atlanta and Dallas theaters, and may extend it to other theaters in
its Southeast region. Its Eastern region already has such a
program.
</P>
<P>
   The R-rated movie policy, which the company considered extending
to PG-13 movies, is based on noise-reduction rather than judgments
about the appropriateness of those movies for young children, said
AMC regional operations manager Gary Suter. In the evening, most
watching R-rated movies are couples on dates who expect an
atmosphere free of noise distractions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to make it so everybody can have a good
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has gotten some questions from parents about the
policy, but most seem to understand, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Could all this mean a return to common courtesy? Don't count on
it, especially if you're hoping the new policies will stop the
couple behind you from talking back to the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to deal with it,'' Suter said. ``But that's a
totally different issue.''

 &HT;    It's `Murder' trying to cover up accident
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nobody does weaselly better than William H. Macy, who reached
his acting apex as the flop-sweating car salesman and would-be
criminal mastermind Jerry Lundegaard in ``Fargo.''
</P>
<P>
   Macy goes to the weasel-well again in ``A Slight Case of
Murder,'' a clever little spin on film noir he co-wrote, from a
novella by Donald Westlake. It's so different from the earnest,
paint-by-numbers style of most TV movies that it's easy to forgive
its minor flaws, and just enjoy watching Macy stammer and stumble
his way through another delicious role.
</P>
<P>
   This time out, Macy is Terry Thorpe, a movie critic on a
cable-TV show who accidentally kills his girlfriend during an
argument. He tries to cover up the crime, with disastrous results.
</P>
<P>
   The first disaster is a visit from a bottom-feeding private
detective (James Cromwell of ``Babe'' in a toupee so hideous it has
to be deliberate), who uncovers what happened and blackmails Terry.
He's only just getting that situation under control when he becomes
a suspect for the cops, led by Adam Arkin as a detective who may or
may not be pretending to be a dumb bungler (a la Columbo).
Meanwhile, he's dealing _ barely _ with both of those, when his
other girlfriend (Felicity Huffman of ``Sports Night,'' Macy's
real-life wife) begins to question his erratic behavior and
increasingly dubious yarns about what's going on. The last thing he
needs is for the detective's over-sexed wife (a hilarious Julia
Campbell) to fall in lust with him, which is of course what
happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murder'' toys with viewers, just as the fates toy with Terry
Thorpe. He teaches a college course in film noir and lectures about
characters he can now identify with: ``a good man trapped by fate
... (in) claustrophobic desperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe isn't really a good man, although he thinks he is, which
is key. He's certainly more likable, though, than Jerry was in
``Fargo,'' and since ``Murder'' is told completely from his point
of view (including irritating talking to the camera breaks), we end
up rooting for him. He's one weasel we hope will somehow pop out of
this trap.

<P>
   An analysis of striking scalloped fracture lines in the frozen
surface of Jupiter's moon Europa has yielded the strongest evidence
yet that a global ocean of liquid water once lay beneath the thick
crust of ice, and may still be there.
</P>
<P>
   The research, based on detailed photographs from the Galileo
spacecraft, shows how the extreme ebb and flow of tides in a
subsurface ocean may have flexed the ice surface and created the
elaborate patterns of curving cracks and ridges on Europa that are
unlike anything else seen in the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   Planetary scientists from the University of Arizona concluded in
a report being published Friday in the journal Science that the
findings make Europa a prime target in the search for life beyond
Earth. Where there is so much liquid water, scientists speculate,
there just might be some elemental forms of life.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since a Voyager spacecraft flew by Europa in 1979,
scientists have entertained the intriguing possibility of a global
ocean below its surface. The ocean, warmed by Europa's interior
heat, could extend as deep as 100 miles, 20 times greater than
Earth's oceans. Its ice crust could be up to eight or 10 miles
thick. Europa is about the size of Earth's moon.
</P>
<P>
   The Galileo spacecraft, which has been orbiting Jupiter and its
four largest satellites since 1995, has produced pictures at closer
range that strengthened the global-ocean hypothesis. But scientists
were puzzled by the chains of scalloped, or cycloidal, fracture
lines that ran for hundreds of miles across the frozen surface of
Europa. Scientists think the distinctive patterns of the fracture
lines reveal their origins and confirm the notion of a Europan
ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona planetary scientists, led by Dr. Gregory Hoppa,
theorized that Jupiter's huge size _ it is 300 times as massive as
Earth _ causes tremendous tidal stresses on Europa. The tidal ebb
and flow would be especially pronounced on a body of liquid water.
According to their model, Europa's ocean tides must rise and fall
some 100 feet, compared with Earth tides of about 4 to 6 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Europa's slightly eccentric orbit, the scientists said,
contribute to the tidal forces that created the cycloid shapes of
the fracture lines. When Europa is closer to Jupiter, the tides are
higher because the planet's gravitational tug is greater. When
Europa is farther away, the tides fall. This causes Europa's ice
shell to flex and crack. The crack would propagate slowly across
the ever-changing stress field, describing an arc.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists using the model say each arc segment in the
scalloped lines forms in 3.5 days, which happens to be the time it
takes Europa to make one complete orbit around Jupiter. Each arc
ranges from 45 miles to 120 miles in length.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Hoppa, of the university's Lunar and
Planetary Laboratory in Tucson, said, ``The only way this model
works is if there is a significant water layer below the ice. Only
if there is a liquid water ocean could there be tides that would
account for the surface features we see.''
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the Arizona team are Dr. B. Randall Tufts, Dr.
Richard Greenberg and Dr. Paul Geissler.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists caution that the findings do not necessarily mean
there is still a liquid ocean under Europa's ice, only that there
was one there when the surface markings were formed. Other
planetary scientists agreed, but noted that the relative absence of
cratering on Europa indicated that the strong ocean tidal forces
must have existed in the recent past. They could not think of any
obvious reason why the liquid ocean would have disappeared in
recent times.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ronald Greeley of Arizona State University in Tempe, a
member of the Galileo science team, said, ``The likelihood is that,
yes, there are liquid oceans on Europa, but we can't say that
definitively with the information available now.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of increasing interest in Europa's watery past or
present, NASA is making plans for a spacecraft to be launched in
2003 and go into an orbit of the Jovian moon in 2008. Its
remote-sensing instruments are to include ice-penetrating radar to
establish once and for all if there are still oceans on Europa.

   There are few things more enjoyable than spending more than you
earn. Especially if you are convinced you can keep doing so
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is now in that position. As a nation, it is
outspending its income by more than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   That fact does not prove that the party is about to end. Many of
the trends that have enabled Americans to spend so much remain in
place. But the recent weakness of the dollar against the Japanese
yen may be the first sign that this party's liquor supply may be
running low.
</P>
<P>
   The measure of such overspending is known as the current account
deficit _ the broadest measure of what we pay to foreigners for
goods, services and other miscellaneous things, less what we
collect from them. It's been big for some time, but now it is
ballooning out of control.
</P>
<P>
   This week the Commerce Department reported that the deficit
reached $80.7 billion in the last quarter, or nearly a billion
dollars a day. That was up 18 percent from the previous quarter _
which itself had been a record.
</P>
<P>
   The proper way to look at such figures is relative to the size
of the economy. There, too, it's a record, equaling 3.63 percent of
gross domestic product, more than twice what it was a couple of
years ago. The previous peak, set in the final three months of
1986, was 3.53 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The growing deficit has not been a problem so far because the
rest of the world has been happy to take all those dollars we pay
for things and invest them in dollar-denominated assets. They give
us cars and barrels of oil, and we give them pieces of paper called
securities. The United States was attractive because it has been
growing while Japan was in a prolonged recession, Europe was
plagued by low growth and high unemployment, and much of the
developing world was in crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, things are starting to change for the better
overseas. Japan is growing, albeit in a stuttering manner, and
attracting investment. The yen has risen sharply against the
dollar, as the Japanese central bank has intervened only
half-heartedly. The recovery in most of developing Asia is well
under way. Europe is also looking healthier, although the German
government's weakness and indecision has hurt the euro.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, alternatives to investing in the United States
are starting to look more attractive. As less money comes into this
country, the pressure on the dollar will increase.
</P>
<P>
   That pressure probably is not going to be too intense for a
while. The Japanese probably will do a better job of holding the
yen down, and speculators who have lately been betting against the
dollar will move on to other markets. But at some point the huge
current account deficit will begin to seem important to investors
and currency traders. Then the dollar will really begin to slide.
``The trade deficit can get bigger and bigger, and no one will care
_ until they do,'' said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of
Hoenig &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Then the U.S. government will face difficult choices.
Protectionist pressures will grow in Washington, and the Federal
Reserve will be forced to raise interest rates _ already higher
than in Europe or Japan _ to attract investment. But those higher
rates could depress inflated stock prices and cause foreigners to
flee America rather than invest more. The higher interest rates
rose, the more pressure the dollar would face.
</P>
<P>
   You may remember that that is exactly what happened to Mexico in
1994, when the world suddenly stopped sending the capital needed to
finance a growing current account deficit. In the aftermath of
that, the United States has lectured that countries must live
within their means. Physician, heal thyself.

SONY, FOR FIRST TIME, TO SELL SET-TOP BOXES TO CABLEVISION

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sony Corp. of Japan Thursday made its first big move
into the U.S. cable television market, with the announcement that
the Cablevision Systems Corp. would buy more than $1 billion worth
of Sony equipment to deliver advanced digital television services
in the New York City area.
</P>
<P>
   Sony makes cameras, studio monitors and other video equipment
used by television production operations around the world, and many
U.S. consumers who subscribe to direct-broadcast satellite services
use Sony decoders to view programs on their televisions. But until
Thursday Sony had not broken into the market for the set-top boxes
that are in almost every one of the roughly 67 million U.S. homes
that use cable television.
</P>
<P>
   Cablevision, one of the nation's largest cable television
carriers, serves about 2.7 million customers in the New York area.
With systems in New Jersey, Long Island, Westchester County and
many areas of New York City, Cablevision is the largest cable
provider in the metropolitan area. (Manhattan is served by Time
Warner Inc.)
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Cablevision said that the new Sony gear would allow
consumers to view movies on demand, play interactive games on their
televisions and enjoy crisper video.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like moving from buggies and carriages to supersonic
transports,'' said James L. Dolan, Cablevision's chief executive.
``The easiest way to characterize it is that this technology puts
the consumer in control of the services on their television set.''
</P>
<P>
   Cablevision says it intends to begin deploying the new services
in the New York area next year, but Cablevision executives would
not say just how many customers in which communities would be
offered the new services by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Cablevision executives said the company intended to spend more
than $1 billion on Sony set-top boxes and an unspecified additional
amount on advanced Sony gear that would work in the core of
Cablevision's network.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Thursday, Howard Stringer, chairman of Sony's
U.S. operation, described the deal as ``another critical step in
our strategy to marry the power of our electronics and technology
assets with our vast entertainment holdings to create a compelling
21st century lifestyle experience.''
</P>
<P>
   An additional aspect of that experience will be the ability to
receive and send electronic mail on the television. But it will not
include high-speed Internet access. Cablevision said it would
maintain its involvement in the high-speed cable modem service
Excite(AT)home, which would remain separate from the advanced
television services covered by the Sony deal.
</P>
<P>
   If there were losers in Thursday's announcements, they appeared
to be General Instrument Corp. and Scientific-Atlanta Inc., which
currently dominate the market for cable television equipment.
Cablevision uses both companies' systems but seemed to show no
hesitation in moving to Sony.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a replication of anything we're doing with GI,''
said Wilt Hildenbrand, Cablevision's senior vice president for
engineering and technology. ``This is a new way of bringing
services to the market.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sony uniquely has that capability,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, General Instrument said it had agreed to be
acquired by Motorola Inc. Sender Cohen, an analyst at Lehman
Brothers, said that the Sony deal highlighted the rationale behind
the General Instrument acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The set-top box market has been a duopoly between GI and SA,
so this is obviously a negative for them,'' he said. ``But this
clearly makes the Motorola deal that much smarter, because General
Instrument can use Motorola's brand.''

WHITE HOUSE ENDS CONTROLS ON EXPORT OF DATA-SCRAMBLING TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Calif.)  (mk) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bucking pressure from the Justice Department, the FBI and
intelligence agencies, the White House on Thursday essentially
eliminated its complex controls on the export of data-scrambling
hardware and software, handing a surprise victory to congressional,
high-technology and privacy groups that have spent years fighting
for the change.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders, who had been planning to vote later this month on
a bill to overturn the Clinton administration's policy, said they
were elated by the change and would pull their bill back until the
administration could draft final regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is huge,'' said Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., who, along
with Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., whose district includes Silicon
Valley, has been championing legislation to eliminate the
encryption export controls.
</P>
<P>
   The technology is used to scramble data and computer
communications in general, and especially to keep them private on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Goodlatte called the administration's
new position ``very close'' to the intentions of his bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tremendous victory for everybody who has been
proposing that the administration change its export policy on
encryption so that we can make it more widely available and U.S.
companies can compete overseas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The change would significantly simplify the Commerce
Department's complex and inconsistent licensing requirements for
the export of strong data-scrambling technology, and essentially
allow U.S. companies to sell their products abroad after a one-time
review. The exceptions would be for products being sold to foreign
governments or military establishments. And a prohibition would
remain on the export of computer security technology to nations the
Unites States labels as terrorist: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Sudan,
North Korea and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Despite increasing pressure over the last few years from
industry, Congress and privacy groups to lift the controls, the
administration, at the urging of the FBI and intelligence
officials, has resisted calls for change. Law enforcement officials
have insisted that the widespread availability of strong encryption
products would make it harder for them to fight terrorists and drug
cartels in the Digital Age.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Freeh, the FBI director, had been pushing to tie any
easing of the export controls to requirements that software and
equipment manufacturers develop technology that would give police
agencies a backdoor key to unscramble encrypted communications when
they suspect a crime has been committed.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials finally lost that argument to the
industry and privacy groups, which noted that strong encryption
products made in other countries were already widely available.
High-technology companies said export controls were simply giving
their competitors overseas an unfair advantage in the global
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates also said that the export rules deprived
Internet users of the most advanced technologies for keeping their
data and communications safe.
</P>
<P>
   As a concession to police agencies, the administration said it
would push for additional money to help law enforcement and
national security experts develop new ways to detect and fight
crimes in electronic settings.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also said it would propose legislation to set
the standards under which investigators would be able to seek
``spare keys'' held by third parties.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Davidson, a lawyer for the Center of Democracy and
Technology, an online civil liberties group based in Washington,
said that proposal would ``open a whole new, complex debate _ under
what circumstances the government should have access to our most
private data.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes were proposed as the House was preparing to vote
this month on the so-called Safety and Freedom Through Encryption
Act proposed by Goodlatte and Lofgren. They followed a report from
a presidential advisory panel in June recommending that the
administration eliminate most of the export controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am surprised that they moved this much this quickly,''
Goodlatte said. ``But we are very pleased that they have done so
and that they have come this close. There is no doubt that this
announcement is a direct result of the fact that we had 258
co-sponsors.''

FRANTIC 911 CALLS BEGIN A NIGHT OF HORROR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The first of almost two dozen 911 calls
arrived at 6:55 p.m. Wednesday night, as a man called to say he
thought shots were being fired in the Wedgwood Baptist Church
sanctuary. The tape begins with the caller's tense news that
someone is shooting amid a youth rally in the church.
</P>
<P>
   The 911 operator picks up the call with a routine greeting:
</P>
<P>
   ``Fort Worth 911, operator K 684.''
</P>
<P>
   Caller: ``Shots fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Operator: ``How many shots were fired?''
</P>
<P>
   Caller: ``Whitman Baptist Church, Whitman and Walton. Southwest
Fort Worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Operator: ``OK, is there anybody hurt?''
</P>
<P>
   Caller: ``I don't know. There's a big rally going on here; I
don't know what else is going on. It may be a, well, if it's a skit
or something I don't know about it, but I'd rather have you on your
way than ...''
</P>
<P>
   Operator: OK, what's your name?
</P>
<P>
   Caller: name deleted.
</P>
<P>
   The caller tells the operator that the assailant pointed a gun
at him and fired several shots.
</P>
<P>
   The operator asks for a description of the shooter. The caller
says he recalls little in his attempt to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had on glasses. He was clear down the hallway. All I saw
was the flash of the muzzle and man, I headed out the other
direction,'' the caller says.
</P>
<P>
   The second call revealed the horror taking place in the church.
The woman caller, who says she is the church nursery coordinator,
says that she was not in the sanctuary but that people are wounded
at the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in the A building. There's a lady who looks like she is
bleeding from the head,'' the woman says.
</P>
<P>
   She describes what she saw: ``A bunch of teen-agers came running
out (of the church) crying,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Operator: ``Tell me what you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Caller: ``OK. There's a lady bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Operator: ``Has she been shot?
</P>
<P>
   Caller (talking to wounded person): ``Have you been shot? She
said, `Yes.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The caller says people are ``Jumping in their cars and taking
off.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman then sees a victim who is dead or severely injured.
.MDNM/ Other calls came from outside the church. One caller says
she was about to drop off her child when she was warned away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was driving my son up there and people came running out and
saying, `Get out, get out, get out.' '' the woman says. ``I know
that man that was yelling at me. It's not fake. He said someone was
in there killing everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Another caller from inside the church tried frantically to get
across to emergency workers just how serious the situation was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have shots being fired, shots being fired at Wedgwood
Baptist Church, 5522 Whitman Ave. Many people are hurt, OK?,'' the
woman says. ``We've got a Columbine incident going on in the place.
I have no idea what is going on.'' The woman is transferred to a
MedStar dispatcher who asks for more information about how many
people are injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea. I was upstairs. I heard guns being fired.
Shots are still being fired. I'm upstairs trying to call 911,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   The dispatcher asks whether people are still in the sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Caller: ``I don't know. I don't hear gunfire anymore. I need to
go check.''
</P>
<P>
   Operator: ``No. You need to stay where you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Caller: ``OK, there's teen-agers here. I just heard gunfire
again. I don't know what's going on in there, but please hurry.''

<P>
   Should anyone have been concerned about mass killer Larry Gene
Ashbrook, whom neighbors described as a social outcast and who
wrote letters filled with unusual claims and references to serial
killings?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, mental health professionals say, is yes, no and
maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at what happened, everybody's light goes on and
says, `We missed that; we really didn't even think of it,' '' said
Dr. Saundra Gilfillan, assistant professor of psychiatry at the
University of Texas-Southwestern Medical School in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do think of it more with kids now because of all the school
shootings,'' said Gilfillan, medical director of the Parkland
Health System's psychiatric services. ``But neighbors or
acquaintances don't usually think of it with adults. In hindsight,
it probably wouldn't have been unreasonable to think someone should
have helped him find a psychiatric evaluation.''
</P>
<P>
   But how?
</P>
<P>
   Lauralee Harris, executive director of the Mental Health
Association of Tarrant County, which serves Fort Worth, said it is
often hard to tell when people need help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most mentally ill people are not problematic,'' said Harris.
``They say things that don't make a great deal of sense or do
things we wouldn't do. However, sometimes people are so obviously
over that line that they clearly need help from neighbors and
friends and family.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris said that, if someone is extremely depressed, talking
about suicide or hurting others, police should be called and the
person's statements should not be challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe a person is suicidal or dangerous, absolutely
call the police,'' Harris said. ``A 911 call is very appropriate.
We suggest if it's someone you don't know well, don't try to
challenge their beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Tarrant County, Mental Health-Mental Retardation can do a
crisis response, but a person's got to be very, very ill,'' she
said. ``From what I'm hearing, I don't know if a crisis team would
have responded (to Ashbrook's behavior.) It seemed like he was
functioning and getting out.''
</P>
<P>
   Churches sometimes attract those with mental illness, who may be
reaching out for help, the professionals said. Ministers said that
is a concern for churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We greet everyone who comes to our church with a warm
welcome,'' First Baptist Church pastor Charles Wade said. ``If our
ushers and greeters detect some anxiety or frustration on the part
of the visitor who comes, we seek to minister to them gently and
firmly as needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A church cannot allow itself to take on a siege mentality,''
he said. ``We will not fence people out and thereby fence ourselves
in. God's people must always be vulnerable, but they must also be
careful. We try to do both.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Hearon, associate director of programs of the Mental Health
Association of Greater Dallas, said that as a licensed professional
therapist she is required to call police if she believes someone is
suicidal or homicidal.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for John Q. Public, that's a hard call in today's world,''
she said. ``We can't predict behavior, especially if mental illness
is involved.''
</P>
<P>
   .MDNM/ As development director of Mental Health Association of
Colorado, Michelle Hoffer dealt with the aftermath of the shootings
at Columbine High School. She said that her agency has tried to
focus on prevention and intervention for those with mental illness
and at risk of suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to do because there was so much emotion,'' Hoffer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Several education programs were developed, many geared towards
suicide and depression, including a speakers bureau and brown-bag
talks for corporations on conflict management, suicide and grief. A
separate program was developed for middle- and high-school
students, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a huge response,'' Hoffer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But every time we hear about these shootings, we cringe
because we wonder whether it will reduce or add to the stigma of
mental illness,'' she said. ``We hope it's an opportunity for us to
get the word out that mental illness is treatable.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilfillan said that the Wedgwood shootings should serve to
heighten awareness about mental illness, and suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best we can hope for is to teach people about suicide, and
suicide potential, and maybe we should be looking and listening in
a different way,'' she said. ``This will make us keenly aware of it
for right now. It will go away, but it will rear its head again.
It's a societal dilemma that probably has not run its course
yet.'' &QL;

COMMENTARY: REFORM PARTY 101 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Text shown in bold should be set in italics.)  
 (bl)  
 By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura has come up with the exciting idea
of recruiting Donald Trump to run as the Reform Party presidential
candidate. This is the sort of creative coupling that could come
only from a chief executive who moonlights as a professional
wrestler. Who better for the balanced-budget party than a man whose
fundamental business philosophy has always been that if you borrow
enough, the banks can't afford to foreclose on you.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party's search for a presidential candidate has left
many people puzzled, wondering how any organization's leadership
could apparently regard Trump, Pat Buchanan, Lowell Weicker and
Ross Perot as equally suitable standard-bearers. I have been
looking into this matter, and I am prepared to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Who is eligible to become the Reform Party candidate for
president of the United States? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   According to party leaders, any U.S. citizen who agrees with the
Reform platform and is prepared to spend the money necessary to get
on the ballot. All it takes is several million dollars and a dream.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; What's in the Reform Party platform? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A whole lot of stuff, actually, down to abolishing the
Appalachian Regional Commission. But the three biggest points seem
to be government reform, trade protectionism and balanced budgets.
The platform specifically says the party opposes tax cuts until the
national debt is paid down.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Does Pat Buchanan oppose tax cuts until the national debt is
paid down? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   According to his spokesman, Buchanan's only problem with the
Republicans' proposed $792 billion tax cut is that it is not large
enough.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; What does the Reform leadership say about that? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The chairman, Russell Verney, says he ``can envision Pat
Buchanan with a straight face saying he supports the party
platform.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Does Gov. Jesse Ventura, the only Reform Party member ever to
actually get elected to anything, support Pat Buchanan? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, who calls Pat Buchanan a ``retread,'' has been floating
the names of Donald Trump and former Connecticut Gov. Lowell
Weicker.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Is Lowell Weicker a protectionist? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Weicker says, ``Hell, no.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Does Donald Trump support the Reform Party platform? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Trump could probably work it into his current political
ideology, which seems firm only in regard to the virtues of tax
incentives for real estate development and the evils of alimony.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; What is the current makeup of the Reform Party membership? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party members seem united mainly on the goal of
opening up the political process until it is finally yawning so
wide that they can step into elective office themselves.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; What ever happened to Ross Perot? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When last seen, Perot was still promising to assemble a panel of
first-class experts to come up with a new plan to look under the
national hood and retool the governmental engine, as soon as he
gets the crazy aunt out of the attic.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; What are the chances that Perot will change his mind and run
for president again himself? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Very slim, since Perot dislikes the limelight and never swerves
unexpectedly from one course to another on the basis of an
inexplicable, lunatic whim.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Will the Reform Party survive into the next millennium? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The 16th-century prophet Nostradamus had a great deal to say
about this topic in a passage translated from Latin only minutes
ago:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The money-mantled minion leaps into the abyss,
</P>
<P>
   Then rises up.
</P>
<P>
   His second, shouting, leans upon the rope. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The seer is unusually forthright here. The rope-leaner is
obviously Ventura in his wrestling persona, whose promotion of
Trump will bear fruit in the year 2000. The first stanza depicts
the luxury-apartment and casino developer accepting the
presidential nomination, in a ceremony followed by a final
cataclysm and the Rapture. A slightly different interpretation
argues that the text foresees President Clinton's recent trip to
New Zealand, during which economic adviser Gene Sperling was
photographed bungee-jumping off a 150-foot bridge.

ERRONEOUS REPORT OF TEEN'S SHOOTING SHAKES FAMILY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Matt Parr's family spent most of Thursday
giving friends the good news that he was fine after the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram erroneously reported that the teen had been hurt in
Wednesday's church shooting rampage.
</P>
<P>
   The phone started ringing about 5 a.m. as friends read the
newspaper and saw Matt Parr's name and picture in a partial list of
seven slain victims and seven wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Parr said his wife assured the first caller that her
16-year-old son was safely in bed. But when she hung up the phone,
she went to check on the teen just to make sure, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the calls began, ``there was just a constant stream,'' Parr
said.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-year-old had little reaction, his dad said, because he
was far more troubled by the tragedy that hurt so many people he
knew, including his aunt, who was wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Parr said he is astounded that his son's name, and
particularly his picture, could appear in the newspaper without the
information being verified.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, neither law enforcement nor hospital officials
were releasing names, so verifying identies became an arduous task.
Parr's name was added to a list of victims, all of which were to be
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   However, in the chaos of trying to sift through dozens of
reports _ some true, some not _ Parr's name was overlooked and not
verified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's this story or any other, accuracy is always the
most important aspect of our work,'' Fort Worth Star-Telegram
Managing Editor Kathy Vetter said. ``In this case, the scene at the
church was chaotic and the pace in the newsroom hectic. That does
not excuse the unneccesary trouble, and the needless worry, we
caused Matt Parr's friends and family.''

FOR MANY NEW YORKERS, STORM WAS MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By N.R. KLEINFIELD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To a large extent, the city hid. It wasn't always
clear from what.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Hurricane Floyd was supposed to roar into town on Thursday
and topple buildings and catapult buses over the Empire State
Building. But where was it?
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, it rained hard. Then it rained less hard. By
early afternoon, it didn't rain at all. Then it rained pretty hard,
and then it didn't. Rain, of course, is something New Yorkers can
usually handle adeptly. A city that prides itself on preparing for
almost anything hates to get apprehensive for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why, in keeping with the urgings of the mayor, when
Conde Nast told its employees they could go home at noon, Joe
Tobin, 30, who works in marketing, kept slogging away, not at all
worried that if he left later he'd be blown to Michigan. Finally,
when the place was almost vacant, he left around 2:30 to go home to
Hoboken, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over-rated,'' was his summation of Floyd. ``I'm not
surprised,'' he said. ``This is just weather. What's the biggest
thing that's going to happen _ my bus is going to get delayed a
little?''
</P>
<P>
   It was a particularly great day to be a kid. No school and yet
your apartment didn't collapse.
</P>
<P>
   It was bizarre waiting for refugees at the array of emergency
shelters set up in the city. The school safety officers assigned to
Benjamin N. Cardozo High School in Queens, one of the designated
shelters, lit up when a reporter wandered in. She was the first
person they had seen all day. All these cots and blankets from the
Red Cross, and zero people. ``It's a slow day,'' acknowledged Jean
Louis, one of the officers.
</P>
<P>
   But tell all this to some of the people in New Jersey. There,
especially in the central and southern parts of the state, it was
like another world, and a very soggy one. Roads were rivers. Power
lines were down. In Hackensack, scuba divers had to rescue
motorists trapped in flooded cars. There was similar flooding in
Connecticut and on Long Island, and people were evacuated along the
tip of the island. Metro-North was forced to suspend service for
part of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   The day the hurricane came was very much one of pointed
contrasts in the metropolitan area, with portions of the region
being overwhelmed, while parts of the city found itself largely
tricked by a rather ephemeral event.
</P>
<P>
   There were certainly instances of hardship even in New York.
Highways were closed part of the day. In the Rosedale section of
Queens, the rainfall was persistent enough to flood basements and
make streets difficult to navigate. Horace and Venetia Ferguson had
two feet of water in their basement. They had bought the brick town
house new only five months ago. &UR;  &LR;  ``Everything is floating down
there,'' Ferguson said. The water had ruined his computer, his
exercise equipment, a number of unpacked boxes of clothing and
thousands of dollars worth of cloth and sewing notions that his
wife needed in her work as a clothing designer and seamstress.
</P>
<P>
   One of the oddities of the day was the parade of sightseers who
reported to the beaches in some of the more precarious areas to
gawk at the weather. A group of hardy ones walked along the beach
in Spring Lake, N.J., 10-foot waves crashing mere yards from them
as red, no-swimming flags flapped on crooked poles. During the
afternoon, dozens of others strolled along the boardwalk at Point
Pleasant Beach _ middle-aged couples, toddlers, teen-agers in their
bare feet.
</P>
<P>
   Sandi and Herb Gomberg drove the 40 minutes from their home in
Freehold, N.J., with their neighbors, Harold and Marie Berg. ``It's
just awesome,'' Mrs. Gomberg said. ``The angriness of the sea is
something awesome you'll never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, there were a lot of pre-emptive strikes against the
storm that did not always seem like a storm. The mayor sent home
early nonessential city workers, and recommended that private
businesses close down well before normal hours. Many did, making
for an unusual mid-day rush. Many businesses, though, would have
none of this. Paying no heed to winds and rain, the Four Seasons
stayed open for dinner like it was just another night. ``Look,
these are New York people,'' said Julian Niccolini, one of the
restaurant's partners. ``This is just a little water.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools didn't open across the region. It was the first time in
memory that the city's school were closed for a hurricane scare,
and by the time the normal dismissal hour rolled along, many
children must have been wondering whether they had gotten away with
some sort of collective prank.
</P>
<P>
   Parents found themselves lugging children to work, often only to
turn around after a few hours and be sent home. Caregivers on Call,
a provider of emergency home care for children and the elderly on
Long Island, said it had dispatched a number of caregivers to homes
to look after a child only to be beaten there by the parents after
their offices closed.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the liberated children found many useful ways to
occupy themselves. Dakota Eisenberg, 10, who lives in Brooklyn,
spent the day chewing on taffy bars and seeing the movie, ``The
Muse,'' with her best friend, Aminah Shor. Albert Watkins, 11, also
of Brooklyn, actually wanted to go to school. ``I just stayed home
and occupied the dog,'' he said.

TNT'S `MURDER' MAKES US PARTY TO A KILLING 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Fargo,'' William H. Macy was Jerry Lundegaard, a car dealer
and world-class schlemiel who tried wiggling free of the law's
vise.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few pints of Lundegaard in Terry Thorpe, the
character Macy co-wrote (with Steven Schachter) and plays in
Sunday's frothy movie ``A Slight Case of Murder'' on TNT cable.
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe is a New York film critic with the sophistication and
some of the confidence that Lundegaard lacked. But like Lundegaard,
he unravels and makes bad decisions as the police close in on him.
</P>
<P>
   His crime is murder. But not the cold-blooded variety. Or even
deliberate _ which means that, technically, it's more like
manslaughter than murder. Try telling that to the cops.
</P>
<P>
   He shoves a girlfriend during a quarrel in her apartment, her
head hits a table, she dies and slam, bam, Thorpe's in a jam.
</P>
<P>
   We first meet him at the scene of the crime. He's arguing with
himself. Call the cops and say it was an accident, thus exposing
his little affair to his other girlfriend (Felicity Huffman)? Or
wipe out his fingerprints, hoof it and hope for the best?
</P>
<P>
   Soon Thorpe stops talking to himself and starts talking to us.
Right at the camera. He's making us his accomplice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is hard,'' he confides to us, in the midst of lying to
police investigators. ``I have a newfound respect for actors.''
</P>
<P>
   The lead police investigator is an aspiring screenwriter played
by Adam Arkin. And the movie's other complication is a tough
blackmailer played by James Cromwell (``Babe,'' ``L.A.
Confidential'').
</P>
<P>
   Part of the fun is that ``A Slight Case of Murder,'' which is
based on a Donald Westlake novella, finds and sustains a seriocomic
tone that keeps anyone from taking it too seriously.
</P>
<P>
   And part of the enjoyment is in the technique. It's a bit like
watching a ``Columbo'' episode from the viewpoint of the killer _
experiencing his cycles of tension and relief as the hunt goes hot
and cold.
</P>
<P>
   Then too, the killer is a film expert, and his banter with
viewers reflects it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry,'' he says to viewers at one point. ``I know this
looks like a scene out of `Notorious.' I'm not Claude Rains. I'm
more like John Cassavetes in `Rosemary's Baby.'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the networks' fall season continues to grind along. I
know it looks like ``The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.'' But it's more
like Dustin Hoffman in ``Ishtar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Judging Amy'' gets a sneak preview _ well, OK, a preview _
Sunday on CBS. It stars Amy Brenneman (``NYPD Blue'') as a single
mom who comes home to Connecticut and becomes a juvenile court
judge.
</P>
<P>
   Tyne Daly plays her mother, a retired social worker, and Dan
Futterman is cast as Brenneman's brother. The series is loosely
based on the life of Brenneman's own mother.
</P>
<P>
   Tune in and you can see Brenneman trying to cut through
courtroom bureaucratese by saying, ``I'd like to talk to the DCF
about the OTC. And I'd like to talk to the DAD. The dad.''
</P>
<P>
   That's as good as it gets. The show is predictable, inexcusably
pokey and, when Daly and Brenneman bump against each other in the
heavier mother-daughter slogs, dangerously close to smarmy.
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday, ``Judging Amy'' moves to 10 p.m. Tuesdays.

BIDI CIGARETTES, SWEET-FLAVORED AND POTENT, REPORTED POPULAR AMONG
YOUTHS

   BOSTON _ Warning of a worrisome new trend in youth smoking,
Massachusetts health officials Thursday released the country's
first official study on the prevalence among teen-agers of smoking
skinny, sweet-flavored and highly potent cigarettes called bidis
that are hand-rolled in India and faddishly popular among young
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The study, whose results are highly approximate because they
were not based on a rigorously random sample, found that among 642
teen-agers in the Boston inner city surveyed this spring, 40
percent had tried a bidi (pronounced beedee), nearly 16 percent
smoked bidis currently and nearly 8 percent were ``heavy users''
who had smoked more than 100.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very disturbing findings that I believe have
national importance,'' said Massachusetts Public Health
Commissioner Howard Koh.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Public Health also announced that a
separate study it undertook on the content of bidis found that,
contrary to the seeming natural innocence of their leaf-wrapped
looks, the cigarettes could contain five times the tar and three
times the nicotine of conventional cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The bidi fad particularly concerns health officials and
opponents of smoking because they say the Indian cigarettes seem
tailor-made to attract young smokers. At about $2 a pack, bidis are
often cheaper than conventional cigarettes, and they are available
in more than a dozen flavors, including mint and strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flavors are obviously meant for children,'' said Alyonik
Hrushow, director of the Tobacco Free Project of the San Francisco
Public Health Department. ``Adults don't usually want to smoke
mango-flavored cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is not only the appeal of the flavors, Ms. Hrushow
said, but also the misapprehensions of many young people about the
cigarettes themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of youth are not aware that they actually contain more
nicotine than regular cigarettes,'' she said. ``Because they're
wrapped in a leaf and sort of sold as being natural, they think
that it's somehow safer, and it's almost like a little underground
sort of behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Because bidis resemble marijuana joints, some young smokers
enjoy an extra air of rebellion when they puff them in public;
bidis also tend to go out frequently because the leaf they are
rolled in does not burn well, requiring frequent re-lighting and
deep inhaling that add to what some see as an impressive ritual.
</P>
<P>
   In India, bidis are considered cigarettes for the poor, and can
be bought for a few cents per pack; they are not flavored there,
and are generally hand-rolled by indigent women and, according to
some reports, children.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In some of the earliest work done on bidi sales in the United
States, teen-agers at the Tobacco Free Project performed a survey
of stores last year that found that bidis were significantly easier
for under-age smokers to buy than conventional cigarettes and that
most packs failed to carry the usual warning label of the dangers
of tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers have complained to the Federal Trade Commission
and the U.S. Customs Service, Ms. Hrushow said.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts health officials will push for tougher checks on
whether stores are selling bidis to under-age smokers and for
tougher labeling practices, said Koh, the public health
commissioner. The state will also ask the Treasury Department to
determine whether child labor is being used to produce bidis, which
would make it illegal to import them.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials said the Boston survey was only a beginning,
statistically, because it was carried out on a ``convenient''
sample of youth _ teen-agers who were willing to speak when
approached in inner-city Boston neighborhoods _ rather than a
carefully random sample. The survey was released Thursday in the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's weekly report.
</P>
<P>
   ``These results will have to be supported in follow-up
studies,'' Koh said, ``but I think this is a warning shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The bidi trend among youth appears to have begun in California
several years ago and headed eastward, showing up especially in
areas known as heights of hipdom, like New York City's East
Village.
</P>
<P>
   Two young anti-smoking advocates who helped perform the Boston
survey, Jwuanita Core and Jennifer Veerasammy, said that when they
asked teens why they smoked bidis, the answers often included a
fondness for the head-rush the potent cigarettes produced.
</P>
<P>
   The replies, Ms. Core said, also included ``they taste better'';
``they were cheaper''; ``they were safer and easier to buy than
cigarettes.'' And some said, ``I like the flavor.''

 &HT;    N.C. beachfront residents reassess risk
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt and Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WRIGHTSVILLE BEACH, N.C. _ When Sandy McCaughey moved here two
months ago, her mother warned her she was headed for ``hurricane
alley.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaughey, 35, laughed off the warning then, but not now. Her
shifting sentiment reflects how some hurricane-battered residents _
joining the ranks of coastal planners and environmentalists _ are
having second thoughts about life at the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go back today and the house is gone,'' the Philadelphia
transplant said Thursday, ``I'm out of here. I can't handle the
stress.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with 2.6 million coastal dwellers from Florida to North
Carolina, in the nation's biggest peacetime evacuation, McCaughey
fled this week in advance of Hurricane Floyd. Two weeks ago, tens
of thousands of North Carolinians evacuated because of Hurricane
Dennis.
</P>
<P>
   In three years, five of the Atlantic's most powerful hurricanes
have wrecked coastal North Carolina. In 1996, Bertha and Fran made
landfall at Cape Fear, as Floyd did early Thursday, leaving behind
extensive flooding and beach erosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the context of five hurricanes in three years, it makes
beachfront development seem like madness,'' said Orrin Pilkey, a
coastal geologist and professor at Duke University. ``We're
thumbing our nose at nature, and nature always bats last on the
coast.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, hundreds of thousands of motorists were trapped on
gridlocked interstate highways in Georgia and the Carolinas. The
experience illustrates how rapid development is increasingly
inconvenient, even risky, during disasters.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Interstate 40 flooding blocked the main highway
from Wilmington to Raleigh. It slowed the return of Floyd evacuees
who had spent the past day or two on the road, some searching
futilely for hotel rooms hundreds of miles from home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those things that I didn't think any of us
totally anticipated,'' said John Copenhaver, Southeast regional
director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. ``Some of the
traffic problems were worse than we expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an emergency management standpoint, including state and
local, that's something we need to take a look at _ how do you
evacuate such a huge number of people from the coast without
putting them into such terrible traffic?''
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina's Pender County _ including part of Topsail
Island passed over by Floyd's eye _ the tidal surge piled 4 feet of
sand atop N.C. 50. It's the only road to the west end of the
island, a narrow spit battered by recent hurricanes, especially
Fran.
</P>
<P>
   The county's emergency management spokeswoman, Mary Anne George,
said she doubts Floyd's wrath would cause people to abandon the
island.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get sand in your toes, you just have to hang
around,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Bush, a coastal geologist at the State University of West
Georgia, said rebuilding beaches is expensive for property owners,
as well as state and local taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, North Carolina generally has been viewed as a
leader in coastal management, Bush said. But as development
increases, state regulators have been pressured to bend the rules.
</P>
<P>
   At the northern tip of Wrightsville Beach, owners of the Shell
Island resort fought to build a seawall to guard the high-rise
building from an encroaching inlet. State law prohibits seawalls.
</P>
<P>
   Seawall disputes have erupted on North Carolina's Outer Banks as
well, including the fight over whether the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse
should be moved inland or bolstered at its perilous Atlantic perch;
the lighthouse was relocated in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where there are sandbags, the beach can't rebuild itself,''
said Bush, who on Thursday was surveying erosion on Oak Island,
N.C., near Cape River.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're holding the beach back in a place where it doesn't want
to be,'' he said. ``The beach wants to be where the road is. But
there are houses between the road and the beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Few places offer a better glimpse at how residents and officials
battle hurricanes to enjoy life on the shore than Wrightsville
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   New Hanover County is North Carolina's second-smallest county in
square miles, but one of the most densely populated, with roughly
150,00 people. It trails only booming Charlotte and Raleigh in
projected growth through 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Just east of Wilmington, Wrightsville Beach has a year-round
population of 3,200. During summer, it swells to 40,000, including
25,000 day trippers to the beach, long known for Johnnie Mercers
Pier.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Bonnie knocked off the end of the pier. Since then
it's been demolished and is now being rebuilt. The pier symbolizes
the storm-weary sentiment along this narrow barrier island.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of property for sale on Wrightsville Beach,
more so than a year ago,'' said town alderman Barry Mowbray. ``The
most significant thing is the stress of leaving your home five
times in 38 months.''
</P>
<P>
   The increasing turnover of property isn't foreboding, said Mayor
Avery Roberts, a 10-year island resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The property values keep going up, even though we have those
hurricanes,'' the 73-year-old mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 reappraisal valued his 3,500-square-foot home on Lollipop
Sound at $1.1 million. Its 1991 appraisal was $459,000.
</P>
<P>
   During Thursday's emergency meeting of aldermen to discuss storm
damage, Roberts was eager for the island to be reopened to property
owners. He got his wish by midafternoon, when the decision was made
to allow them to return at 6 p.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It was possible only after a restoration of sewer services, one
of numerous problems spawned by Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that can go wrong today is going wrong,'' town
manager Tony Caudle told aldermen during an emergency meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The county's landfill was closed, so Wrightsville Beach dump
trucks couldn't empty their loads. That bogged down the removal of
storm debris.
</P>
<P>
   Flooding clogged sewer drains with 10 million gallons of water.
It couldn't be pumped out until electricity was restored to the
island's main pumping station during the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The high storm surge washed away soil under a portion of the
four-lane drawbridge road leading from the mainland to Wrightsville
Beach. State highway workers hurriedly put in fill dirt at the
urging of town officials who wanted all lanes to reopen for
islanders' return.
</P>
<P>
   The surge also buckled wooden docks in Banks Channel and turned
a large sailboat on its side.
</P>
<P>
   Patrolling the debris-littered island, police officer Trey
Jordan pointed out problems not easily detected. While damage to
homes and businesses was light, the storm surge caused widespread
flooding of buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere you see had 3 feet of water in it,'' Jordan said,
driving along the back side of the island near the Intracoastal
Waterway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Downstairs anywhere on this island is a major risk,'' said
26-year-old Dawn Allison, who has moved several times on
Wrightsville Beach. She's not interested in moving to higher ground
off the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are lucky enough to live on the beach,'' she said,
sipping a beer as she waited to return home, ``you are lucky.

<P>
   SANA, Yemen _ Failing last-minute intervention by Yemen's
president, the people of this ancient city may be summoned to a
city-center square sometime in the next few weeks to watch a firing
squad execute the leader of an extremist Islamic group that
abducted 16 Western tourists on a desert road near Aden in
December.
</P>
<P>
   The abductions led to a gun battle between the self-styled
Islamic Army and Yemeni troops in which three Britons and an
Australian were killed, two of them by close-range gunshots to the
head. According to evidence at the trial, the fatal shots were
fired by the Islamic rebels on the orders of Zain Abu Bakr
al-Mehdar, a shock-haired, 28-year-old Yemeni whose first
experience of a ``jihad,'' or Muslim holy war, was as a guerrilla
fighter against Soviet troops in Afghanistan in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Mehdar, who returned to Yemen in the early 1990s using the nom
de guerre Abu Hassan, did not help his chances with an unrepentant
performance at his trial. He told the court that the tourists were
``grandchildren of pigs and monkeys,'' and that his only regret was
that if his pistol had not jammed, he could have killed others.
``God sent them to us, so we took them,'' he said. ``If I live, I
will kill some more.''
</P>
<P>
   From afar, the tourist killings looked like confirmation of the
worst fears for Yemen, which for much of the decade has been
depicted in Western intelligence reports as fertile ground for the
kind of radical Islamic movement that has erupted into violence in
other parts of the Muslim world. One of the 20 poorest countries in
the world, with more than half its 16 million people illiterate, an
unemployment rate of at least 35 percent and an Islamic tradition
that took root in the seventh century while the Prophet Mohammed
was alive, Yemen also has one other prime qualification as a
possible base for an Islamic uprising.
</P>
<P>
   After Soviet troops withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989,
intelligence reports indicated that hundreds, and possibly
thousands, of the Muslim guerrillas had taken refuge among tribal
groups in Yemen's rugged mountains. Some, like Mehdar, the man
convicted of the tourist killings, were Yemenis. Others included a
cross-section of the mujahedeen, or holy warriors, who had fought
the Russians _ Algerians, Egyptians, Iraqis, Sudanese, Somalis and
others, many of whom feared arrest as subversives if they returned
home.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the fighters never mounted a serious political
challenge here, and never did much damage until the tourist
killings. Those killings virtually snuffed out Yemen's budding
tourist industry and deterred tens of millions of dollars in
possible foreign investment in the country's oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the former guerrillas eventually tired of primitive
lives in the mountains and went home or melted into ordinary
civilian lives in Yemen, while others, including Mehdar, lent their
fighting skills to Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh in the 1994
civil war here.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Saleh ponders Mehdar's fate _ a Supreme Court ruling
late in September is expected to reject his family's clemency
pleas, leaving a decision on his execution to the president _ many
Yemenis believe the lesson of the tourist killings is not that
Islamic radicalism is the unavoidable fate of poor Arab countries
like Yemen. Rather, they say, even here armed Islamic groups,
especially those that make victims of tourists and other civilians,
are proving to have scant appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people represent nothing, absolutely nothing, in the
psychology of the Yemeni people, and nothing that has anything to
do with the gospel of Islam,'' said Faris Sarabani, the
American-educated editor of The Yemen Observer, an English-language
newspaper in Sana. ``Attacking Westerners is not a matter of faith;
it's a matter of tortured psychology, and it's seen as such by the
vast majority of Yemenis. In fact, they're not seen as Muslims at
all, they're seen as apostates.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar views can be heard just about everywhere a visitor goes
in Yemen _ among the spice merchants and the craftsmen in the
bazaars, among students in schools and colleges, even among
political groups that are themselves steeped in the most
conservative forms of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One of the harshest denunciations of Mehdar came from the leader
of a political party, Islah, with strong links to the country's
most powerful Muslim clerics and a wide following among the
mountain tribes that are among the most conservative of all
Yemenis.
</P>
<P>
   The Islah leader, Sheik Abdullah Hussein al-Akhmar, said he
hoped that Saleh would authorize Mehdar's execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Koran teaches us that executing criminals ensures life to
others, and so it will be with Abu Hassan,'' he said. ``Just
because some crazed individual commits an act of terrorism, it
doesn't mean it has anything to do with Islam. When some lunatic
shoots children in an American school, has that got anything to do
with ordinary Americans? If you ask whether people like Abu Hassan
have any future in Yemen, my answer is no, no, 1,000 times no.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Such views were common among younger Yemenis, many of whom share
the passions of their counterparts elsewhere _ passing time surfing
the Internet at one of Sana's cybercafes, watching MTV on satellite
television, or cruising the streets on Japanese motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed Yunis, 20, a college student, shook his head, then
pointed a finger at his temple in an imaginary gunshot, at the
mention of Mehdar. ``We want foreigners to come here and create
jobs,'' he said. ``How is killing them going to help with that?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many Yemenis take a more favorable view of Osama bin Laden, the
Saudi-born, Afghan-based Islamic radical accused by the United
States of being the mastermind and financier of the bombings of the
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998, which killed
224 people.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, for whom Washington has posted a $5 million reward,
has been something of a poster-boy in popular magazines in Yemen,
partly because his father was born in Yemen and partly because he
is identified among Yemenis as an uncompromising opponent of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot compare Osama bin Laden with Abu Hassan,'' said
Akhmar, the Islah party chief. ``By fighting the Russians in
Afghanistan, and striking out against the Americans for their
support of Israel, bin Laden has shown that he is a true Muslim.
And don't forget that when bin Laden was fighting against the
Russians, the United States regarded him as an ally. It was only
later, when he attacked American interests, that the United States
changed its position and called him a terrorist.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After the tourist killings in December, Western intelligence
agencies investigated reports of a possible link between Mehdar's
group and bin Laden. Among other things, the agencies wanted to
establish who had financed the Mehdar group, whose captured members
were found to have had an extensive arsenal and a satellite
telephone, suggesting wealthy backers. But senior Western diplomats
said the inquiries had shown ``no operational links'' between the
Yemeni group and bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Yemeni official suggested that financing for the Yemeni
rebels might have come from Saudi Arabia, which has tense relations
with Yemen that are linked to a long-running border dispute. But
the only indisputable foreign backer of Mehdar's Islamic Army to
have emerged from testimony at the Yemeni's trial was a
London-based, Egyptian-born Muslim cleric, Abu Hamza al-Masri.
</P>
<P>
   When he abducted the tourists, Mehdar was seeking to trade their
freedom for that of 10 foreign Muslims jailed on conviction of
terrorism in Aden, Yemen's second-largest city. The 10, including
eight Britons, claimed to have come to Yemen to study Arabic or for
vacations, but evidence at their trial showed that several had
visited a ``training camp'' run by Mehdar in the Abyan mountains of
southern Yemen. After a car chase in Aden, a vehicle rented by one
of the men was found to be carrying bomb-making materials, rockets
and other weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In London, Masri, the cleric, whose son and son-in-law were
among those arrested by the Yemenis, had a brief run of notoriety
in the British press, to which he gave a raft of interviews in
which he hinted at links to bin Laden. But after holding Masri for
several days under anti-terrorism laws, British police released the
one-eyed cleric, telling reporters privately that he was more of a
``windbag'' than an active terrorist threat. ``He's not so much a
mujahedeen as a media-hedeen,'' a British investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Mehdar remains in an underground cell at the
``House of Happiness,'' a lock-up in Sana that owes its name to the
bitter irony of Yemenis who have been held, and sometimes tortured,
there. Through his lawyers, he has let it be known that his
attitude remains unchanged from his trial, when he said he would
welcome execution, since it would prompt young Yemenis to fight for
an Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to finish this quickly, go ahead _ take me outside
and shoot me,'' he said. ``I don't care.''

IT'S SUNDAY, AND VENEZUELANS HAVE THE PRESIDENT'S EAR

   CARACAS, Venezuela _ On line 2, Yamile was calling from Puerto
Ordaz to ask how she could help her father collect the pension due
him. On line 1, Zuly from Guarenas was waiting for her turn on the
air, hoping to get in a word about AIDS prevention campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Live from the studios of Radio Nacional de Venezuela here, it's
``Hello, President,'' the country's most unusual radio show. It
features President Hugo Chavez taking calls every Sunday morning
for two hours from any Venezuelan with a problem, a complaint or a
suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   So when Pedro Marrero, 72, a resident of the same neighborhood
where Radio Nacional is based, called recently to complain about
his minuscule $150-a-month pension, Chavez expressed sympathy, just
as many talk show hosts would do. It is not fair, he said, that top
executives of the state oil company can retire with as much as
$25,000 a month in benefits while a bus driver like Marrero has to
struggle to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do away with this,'' he said earnestly before
suddenly changing the subject and asking Marrero if his wife made
good coffee. When Marrero said she did, Chavez, who took office in
February promising to lead a peaceful social revolution, urged him
to ``send a cup over here for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the calls, which average about 14 a program, come from
ordinary Venezuelans who have run into problems with the state
bureaucracy and want the president to help them resolve problems
involving housing, education, health, schooling or sewage.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Eduardo Plaza, for instance, called in from Trujillo to
complain that a corrupt Health Ministry functionary was holding
back a permit that would allow him to move his pharmacy to a new
location.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to check it out,'' promised Chavez, who in 1992
led an unsuccessful coup attempt. A presidential aide, Capt.
Orlando Pina, said that a follow-up dossier was prepared both for
each case discussed on the air and the 700 or so additional letters
sent to the station each week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president himself reads a lot of them,'' he said, ``and
attends personally to the ones that are most affecting.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Between calls on one recent program, Chavez found time to
ruminate about topics ranging from the health of Atlanta Braves
slugger Andres Galarraga, who is Venezuelan, to the geography of
the Amazon. At one point he even broke into an Andean folk song,
stopping after the first verse and apologizing for his imperfect
rendition by saying, ``I'm a little hoarse today, brother.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Chavez also makes a point of discussing his official agenda for
the coming week, mentioning people and groups he is to meet and
why. He often announces major policy initiatives on the show,
sometimes even to the surprise of Cabinet ministers, regularly
blasts his critics and set off a diplomatic dispute with
neighboring Colombia by declaring on the air that he was recalling
his ambassador to Bogota in response to a perceived insult in a
speech by an official there.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez also has both a regular television show, ``Face to Face
With the President,'' and a weekly newspaper, The President's Post,
and rarely passes up a chance to express an opinion on any subject
that interests him. On a trip to New York in June, he threw out the
first ball at a Mets game and eventually wandered up to the
broadcast booth, where he delivered the Spanish-language color
commentary during what turned out to be an extra-inning game.
</P>
<P>
   But he has shown a particular affinity for radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was in prison following the events of 1992, he studied
the news media very closely,'' said Teresa Maniglia, director of
Radio Nacional. ``He came to understand that even when television
is unavailable, radio gets you everywhere and anywhere, and not
long after he became president, he hatched the idea for this
program and even came up with the name for it.''
</P>
<P>
   When ``Hello, President'' first went on the air in May, only a
handful of state-run stations carried it. Now the program's
popularity is such that more than 60 stations broadcast it,
including many that are privately owned and one each in Mexico and
Spain, and it has become the highest-rated program in its time
slot.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've ever met Hugo Chavez, you sense right away that he
is a simple person who has a tendency to break protocol,'' Ms.
Maniglia said when asked to explain the show's rapidly growing
following. ``That is innate in him, and people like it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, so many people were going to the Radio Nacional studios
in hopes of speaking with the president after the program,
generating traffic congestion and neighbors' complaints, that
Chavez has had to expand the idea. He now goes directly from the
studio to the presidential palace every Sunday to meet with
constituents who wait for him there with petitions and requests for
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't attend to all of them, and that was bothering me,''
Chavez said on the air in explaining the decision. ``So now they
can wait comfortably in the shade, sitting on chairs, drink some
juice and have access to toilets. Last week I spent an hour with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In a broader sense, the program also exemplifies Chavez's
notions of what constitutes democracy. He has repeatedly attacked
Venezuela's National Congress and its state legislatures as
unrepresentative bodies that are out of touch with the citizenry,
and has sought their dissolution on the ground that they respond
not to the people's wishes but only to what he calls ``a corrupt
and discredited party elite.''
</P>
<P>
   To complement traditional republican institutions, Chavez has
made it clear that he favors as much direct personal contact as
possible between national leaders and the masses, without
intermediaries, whether they be elected officials or the press,
getting in the way. Those views are likely to be reflected in the
new constitution that a National Constituent Assembly loyal to
Chavez is now drawing up.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the show also provides political benefits, allowing Chavez
to demonstrate his common touch and solidify his popularity, which
is at a record 75 percent favorable level. Sept. 5, for example,
was the day before the 21st birthday of his eldest daughter, and he
closed the program by reminiscing about her birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even have the money to pay the clinic,'' he recalled,
explaining that he was an army lieutenant in a provincial town at
the time and had to make a trip to Caracas to ``ask for a loan so
that I could pay the bill.'' At that point, his voice choked and he
fell uncharacteristically silent, overcome by emotion as an
associate gently patted him on the back.

STUDY PUTS U.S. FOOD-POISONING TOLL AT 76 MILLION YEARLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although the United States has one of the safest
food supplies in the world, about 76 million Americans suffer food
poisoning each year and about 5,000 die from it, the federal
government said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta said
the estimates in a study it released Thursday were the most
complete ever compiled on food-borne illnesses (the agency avoided
the everyday term ``food poisoning'') and were based on many
sources, including death certificates, hospital surveys and
academic studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``These new estimates provide a snapshot of the problem and do
not measure trends and do not indicate that the problem is getting
better or worse,'' said CDC Director Jeffrey Koplan in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Mead, a bacteria specialist at the CDC, who is an
author of the study, said it contained no startling revelations
from a scientific standpoint. But there are two conclusions that
challenge earlier findings by the CDC. The agency's estimate of
annual illnesses caused by food poisoning is more than twice as
high as that suggested in earlier studies, which put the figure at
30 million. Its estimate of deaths, on the other hands, is much
lower than the old figure of 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   The study does not address the safety of imported foods. And it
does not lay blame on farmers or poultry producers or beef
processors or supermarkets or restaurants, or any other link in the
American food chain, although Mead said in a telephone interview
that updates of the study might do so in future years.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that people not be alarmed by these
statistics,'' Mead said, ``but it's also important they take steps
to avoid becoming one of the statistics.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many food-related illnesses can be avoided by cooking hamburger
thoroughly, washing kitchen cutting boards well _ especially after
they are exposed to raw meat _ and drinking only pasteurized milk,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said the
findings released Thursday should persuade Congress to enact
food-safety measures proposed by President Clinton. They include
legislation to give federal agencies greater authority over the
food industry and expand inspections and research.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The public-health burden of food-borne disease is
substantial,'' Shalala said, although she did not differ with the
study's conclusion that American food, over all, is safe.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington
consumer group, said the report showed that more than common-sense
kitchen hygiene is needed. ``The odds are 1 in 4 that you'll get
sick this year from contaminated foods,'' said Caroline Smith
DeWaal, the center's food-safety director, using the federal
government's estimate of 76 million illnesses a year. ``In today's
food-safety lottery, odds are 1 in 840 that you'll be hospitalized
and 1 in 55,000 that you'll die. Those aren't good odds for the
American public.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeWaal urged Congress to approve all the money Clinton has
requested for his program (more than $100 million) and said the
White House and Congress should go further by creating a single
powerful agency with ``farm-to-table'' authority to regulate food.
</P>
<P>
   The Grocery Manufacturers of America, a trade group representing
many big food and beverage companies, said today that it welcomed
the findings of the CDC study.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is long overdue,'' said Brian Sansoni, a
spokesman for the group. But he said the group opposed creation of
a ``super agency'' as cumbersome and unneeded.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The federal study said food-borne diseases had been grossly
underreported, in part because milder cases might be mistaken for
other illness, or because the sufferer simply did not bother to
consult a doctor once the symptoms had gone away. Even if a
sufferer does seek treatment and the illness is diagnosed as
food-borne in nature, the doctor or laboratory do not always relay
the information to public health agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Deaths from food-related diseases _ if overestimated in the past
_ have, paradoxically, also been underreported officially, the
study found.
</P>
<P>
   Mead said the study contained no striking findings about
particular kinds of foods or specific bacteria, viruses or
parasites. Not surprisingly, the study linked various strains of
salmonella to a high percentage of food-related illness.
</P>
<P>
   But Koplan said reliable information _ surprising or not _ had
never been more important. New bacteria and viruses evolve, and old
ones grow more resistant to treatment. Americans dine out more,
thus entrusting their health to strangers.
</P>
<P>
   And the baby-boomers are aging. The elderly, along with
children, are the most vulnerable to food illness.

BUSH, AT SCENE OF SHOOTINGS, DEFLECTS QUESTIONS ABOUT GUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ It was an all too familiar tableau of modern
American tragedy. A gunman inexplicably kills children, this time
at a Baptist Church, and a politician shows up to offer comfort and
promise action.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, the politician was Texas Governor George W. Bush,
the Republican presidential front-runner, and his two jobs had
suddenly come together in the aftermath of the gunfire. An ardent
opponent of gun control, and an outspoken advocate of the right to
carry concealed weapons, Bush interrupted a campaign trip and
arrived on the scene facing questions about his pro-gun stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know a governmental law that will put love in people's
hearts,'' Bush said, decrying what he called a ``wave of evil.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a moment in the midst of a campaign that has gone almost
entirely his way, that may provide an opening for Bush's rivals who
back some greater gun control _ Elizabeth Dole among the
Republicans and the two Democratic contenders _ to argue that Bush
is too closely allied with the gun lobby. Moreover, it might
undercut, on this score at least, Bush's argument on the stump that
his achievements in Texas provide a model for the rest of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the shooting, some Republicans who expect Bush to be
the nominee figured that Democrats would run ``attack'' ads next
fall that highlight Bush's position in favor of carrying concealed
weapons. If such ads run, the killing in Bush's backyard might
provide ample, if controversial, footage.
</P>
<P>
   After a night of indecision about whether to leave the campaign
trail, Bush thrust himself into the tragedy, canceling two Michigan
fund-raisers in order to fly back to Texas and visit the victims.
He had been informed late Wednesday night that the gunman, Larry
Gene Ashbrook, 47, had burst into a prayer service with two
handguns, killing seven people, injuring others and then committing
suicide. The two guns reportedly were bought legally, one at a flea
market, the other at a gun store.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-afternoon, Bush had arrived at the Southwest High School,
which was attended by some of the victims and is near the church.
Awaiting him were students, politicians and a horde of reporters,
many of them asking about Bush's campaign and his position on guns.
</P>
<P>
   Bush calmly deflected the questions, seeking to turn the focus
away from guns and toward his belief that students were uniting in
prayer against hatred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hundreds of students poured out to the flagpole to pray, not
once but twice,'' Bush said. ``That is an outpouring of love and
concern that happpened in a spontaneous way...there is some
goodness that can come out of tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what government can do to prevent such tragedies, Bush
said that the government ``can send clear signals that there will
be consequences for bad behavior.'' Pressed on what kind of signal
was sent by his approval of a 1995 bill that allows Texans to carry
concealed weapons with a permit, Bush responded that, ``I believe
the law we passed in Texas has made Texas a safer place.''
</P>
<P>
   While most of the Republican candidates are roughly in line with
Bush on guns, Dole has advocated some controls, such as child
safety locks on guns. The big difference is with the Democratic
candidates. Former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley has called for
registration of all handguns and Vice President Al Gore has
suggested a series of tough gun control measures.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, speaking at the White House, acknowledged
that there was nothing the government could do to prevent every
such tragedy, but he added: ``There is a lot more we can.'' Clinton
has called for the passage of numerous gun control measures, but a
coalition of Republicans and Democrats so far have prevented them
from becoming law.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Southwest High School, the principal, Susan Gregory,
and the Democratic mayor of Fort Worth, Kenneth Barr, both agreed
with Bush that there was little reason to thing another gun law
would have made a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really a tough issue in Texas,'' Barr said. ``We need to
really tighten up the laws we have.'' But Barr also said that
handguns and assault weapons ``are tearing our cities up.'' By
day's end, Bush had visited some shooting victims at local
hospital, comforted relatives and students and visited the church
where the shooting occurred. Thursday night he headed home to
Austin, where he planned to have a long talk with his 17-year-old
twin daughters about why some people have ``evil in the heart.''

RAYTHEON TO CLOSE SOME FACILITIES, FIRE WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raytheon Co. will take an unexpected charge against earnings of
up to $450 million to close some facilities and lay off workers.
</P>
<P>
   The cutbacks will help make up for a shortfall in revenues in
Raytheon's core defense business _ a shortfall that will cause the
nation's third-largest defense contractor to miss earnings
estimates of 95 cents per share for the third quarter and $4 per
share for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon executives didn't reveal Thursday whether there would
be any cuts in Massachusetts. Raytheon chairman and chief executive
Dan Burnham did say the restructuring would focus on the company's
electronics and construction business units, with many of the cuts
to involve administrative and support workers. Chief financial
officer Frank Caine specifically cited Raytheon's Lexington
headquarters as a likely target. Plans for the cuts will be
finalized over the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actions that we're talking about are necessary to ensure
that we can continue to meet our long-term revenue growth and
profitability goals,'' said Burnham.
</P>
<P>
   Confirmation of the cutbacks came Thursday in order to stanch
Wall Street whisperings that have pummeled Raytheon stock this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were rumors that the company was going to miss their
earnings,'' said Joseph San Pietro, a senior aerospace analyst
</P>
<P>
   for Wasserstein Perella Securities in New York. Matters weren't
helped when Burnham suffered a broken wrist and some broken ribs in
a fall from a horse last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Worries about the health of Burnham and his company knocked
Raytheon's Class A shares from 65 5/16 on Monday to 60 3/4
Wednesday, while Raytheon Class B shares went from 66 to 60 15/16
in the same period. So Burnham and his chief financial officer
Frank Caine decided to end the speculation by revealing the bad
news _ or as much of it as they were certain of.
</P>
<P>
   Investors rewarded Raytheon's candor by sending its stock to a
52-week low _ 53 1/2 for Class A and 53 5/8 on Class B shares, both
traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham said while defense-contract revenue was growing, the
rate of growth was lower than had been expected because of delays
in government decisions to issue contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with underlying defense spending up,'' he said, ``the big
programs tend to get awarded months later than what I think were
reasonable presumptions beforehand.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the ongoing restructuring of Raytheon, which
began when Burnham took the helm last October, has revealed still
more ways to trim costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``As all of the operations have come together, we're finding
that we have more opportunity on support costs,'' Caine said. That
means a close look at administrative jobs in all of Raytheon's
business units, as well as its headquarters, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst San Pietro believes the moves by Raytheon reflect a
decision to continue strengthening its position in the tough market
for defense and aerospace companies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, San Pietro noted the revenue slowdown is largely
due to delays in receiving income for defense contracts that are
already signed. That means the missing revenue is merely delayed
and will flow into the company in future quarters.

INTERNATIONAL FORCE SET TO DEPART FOR EAST TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TIMOR-U.S.) 
(mk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARWIN, Australia _ Foreign troops, ships and planes converged
here as an international peacekeeping mission prepared to depart
within days for strife-torn East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers from Britain, Thailand and nine other countries,
including a small contingent of Americans, will join 4,500
Australian troops.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is expected to provide transportation
services, including the airlifting of trucks and other heavy
equipment, according to Adm. Chris Barrie, chief of the Australian
defense forces.
</P>
<P>
   The United States may also help with logistics and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Barrie expressed confidence that the force, expected to number
7,000 troops, would be successful. But he acknowledged that there
could be casualties, and suggested that a hostile response from
Indonesia's army posed the greatest threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest fear is that things don't go as I've outlined, and
we don't get the cooperation we need,'' Barrie said.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia has promised to allow the international force to
restore order in East Timor, which has been convulsed by violence
since its people voted for independence in a U.N.-organized
referendum last month.
</P>
<P>
   But with reports that Indonesian troops have supported and even
joined with anti-independence militias in acts of terror, there is
no guarantee that the militias will simply step aside.
</P>
<P>
   Barrie said the rules of engagement under which the troops would
operate had not been determined. But he added, ``We will not put
the force in there with its hands tied behind its back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will get a very good outcome, and we can do this
quickly with their support,'' he said. ``But don't let me shy away
from the tough question. We will deliver on this mission. Let that
not be in doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   The first foreign troops, 250 Gurkha soldiers dispatched by
Britain, landed here Thursday. The Gurkhas, who are Nepalese, were
selected because of their ability to operate in the tropical
climate of East Timor, according to their commander, Brig. David
Richards.
</P>
<P>
   As the military mobilization here picked up pace, so too did
efforts to provide food and other relief to the thousands of East
Timorese who have been forced to flee their homes. U.N. officials
said Thursday that food drops organized by the World Food Program
would begin imminently.

TYSON RETURN SET, BUT FOR WHOM IS HE FIGHTING? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Mike Tyson sat at a podium in the Hollywood Theatre
of the MGM Grand Casino Thursday looking like a well-used up 1970s
lounge act.
</P>
<P>
   His hair was back to the thicker cut he wore in his earliest
days as a boxer and didn't quite look right after years of seeing
him with a closely shaved cut and a trademark gash along one side.
</P>
<P>
   His shirt bore a strong resemblance to the disco style of 20
years ago with a wide collar and wild swirling designs all around,
a shirt from back when he was a kid who believed boxing could save
him from a life of poverty, crime, and self-doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two decades later, here sat Tyson, broke again and forced
to train relentlessly for fights that will earn big money for the
IRS, Showtime, the MGM, his lawyers, his accountants, his doctors,
his seldom-seen wife, his new promoter Dan Goossen, his new manager
Shelly Finkel, his new trainers Tommy Brooks and Jay Bright, and
even his long-fired trainer Kevin Rooney, who holds a judgment
against Tyson that pays him $250,000 a fight until Rooney gets $4
million out of him.
</P>
<P>
   But what is in it for Mike Tyson?
</P>
<P>
   That question seemed to hang in the air unanswered Thursday as a
33-year-old man trapped in a personal twilight zone spoke of
preparing for an Oct. 23 return to the ring against Orlin Norris,
Tyson's first fight since serving a six-month jail sentence in
Maryland on an assault charge that stemmed from a fender-bender
highway accident. Fittingly, it is a fight unlike any since the
disco days of his career, a match that is sure to be fought before
a less-than-sellout crowd and will be shown on cable television
rather than pay-per-view, the outlet for nearly all of Tyson's
fights over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   As always, Tyson seemed aware of his fate and resigned to it, a
man more acted upon than acting. At one point it was suggested that
Tyson failed to show the fire he used to have when he barely
escaped a January match with Frans Botha. It was a fight in which a
tentative Tyson lost every round until he dropped a one-punch
concussion on Botha.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike so many of his predecessors, Botha had not been
intimidated by Tyson's glowering presence, a fact that actually
cost him the victory when he grew overconfident and carelessly ran
into a shot to the chin.
</P>
<P>
   Of that night Tyson recalled two things _ his fear and one
fierce punch that, as so many others had in a life of tumult, saved
him from himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my first fight in 2 1/2 years and I was pretty much
nervous and scared to death at the same time,'' Tyson said. ``I was
feeling myself out. I was somewhat lethargic. I needed to get one
under the wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been off four years,'' after a rape conviction sent him to
an Indiana prison, ``then I was suspended a year'' for biting
Evander Holyfield's ears during a match. ``Then I came back and
beat Botha and I've been off nine months. That's a lot of
inactivity. They did a pretty good number on me but I'm still going
to win the title again. If anybody makes a mistake, they're going
to take a dirt nap. That's what I get paid to do. Win and win
spectacularly.''
</P>
<P>
   And win he is likely to do against the undersized Norris, a
former cruiserweight champion who holds victories over four former
heavyweight champions but none of note. Tony Tubbs, Tony Tucker,
Greg Page, and Oliver McCall are no preparation for even a Tyson
who is a shadow of the fighter he once was. But this fight is not
about Norris.
</P>
<P>
   Few Tyson fights are about anyone but Tyson and so it is again.
But his latest return is about more than boxing. It is about the
dissolution of what might have been, a fact Tyson seems to
understand but has problems facing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave the fans what I am,'' he said when asked if he felt
he'd let his followers down in recent years. ``I am a human being.
Being a human being, you make mistakes in life. The difference with
me is I'm under a microscope.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have issues we're dealing with. Why are some reporters
dysfunctional alcholics? Why are some people pedophiles? I'm not as
bad as some. But this is not about rewriting the book.''
</P>
<P>
   What it is about, frankly, is writing a few checks, which is
what it's always been about for Tyson and everyone around him. His
purses have been well in excess of $200 million in his career and
he will earn $10 million more when he faces Norris. Yet in the end
they have left him deeply in debt and forced to continue fighting
at a time when he seems to be spent from his prior battles.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, I owe Showtime my life,'' Tyson said of the cable channel
that has fronted him millions. ``I got kids, man. I gotta keep
fighting just to pay my bills. I'm just trying to get out of this
debt Don King got me involved with. I still love to fight, but
there comes a time when the monotonousness is very difficult.
There's people telling you what to do when you're a grown man.''
</P>
<P>
   So here he was Thursday, a broke millionaire of 33 who has twice
been to state prison being asked to explain how he got into this
mess. His answer said more about him than his fists ever did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's politically correct to put me in prison,'' Tyson said.
``If Mike Tyson comes to your courtroom and you don't put him away,
you have a judicial malfunction in your courtroom. But listen, man,
I have no one to blame but myself. Others contributed to it, but I
gotta carry the weight for a fool alone.''

   People magazine says  &UR; Annette Bening &LR;  could be nominated for an
Oscar for ``American Beauty,'' and applause broke out at a San
Francisco screening the other night, but a few feminists in the
audience weren't giving thumbs up.
</P>
<P>
   They said they were appalled at the character played by Bening,
a vindictive and frigid suburban real estate saleswoman who's
horrid to her daughter, mean to her husband and fawning to her
competitor. The role, they said, is a woman-hating stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   Bening had been scheduled to be at the screening but canceled
all publicity appearances because of her pregnancy. She told People
magazine, ``When I read this character, I felt that I had met her.
I grew up in the suburbs in those houses where it looks one way and
it's another.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the naysayers was equally bothered by the movie's
portrayal of the suburbs. ``This is supposed to be a hip,
avant-garde film, but in a way, it's a very retro film,'' she said.
``It's asking, `Aren't we superior to these weird dysfunctional
people in the suburbs?' And I thought, `Who are we to be so
arrogant about it?' ''

girls, more drugs and a 30th birthday. At the very least we were
going to be the mook running for president of the United States
using the disappointments, failures and vexations of loser
suburbanites as the main plank in our campaign platform. And what's
really infuriating is who's to blame. We bought these FedEx
Federalist and Boomer Tudor houses, these Phony Colonials and Taras

IN JAKARTA, NEWS OF TIMOR IS BARELY A BLIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TIMOR-AUSTRALIA, TIMOR-U.S.) 
(bl) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ East Timor was on the news, but the
passengers in an airport departure lounge the other day paid little
attention. Then came a report on a major corruption scandal and the
room fell silent; this was the news they cared about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard about East Timor, I listen, but it doesn't really
mean that much to me,'' said Bagus Adikusumo, 30, a real estate
consultant who was one of the passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I want to see the people in Baligate go to prison,'' he
said, referring to revelations that hundreds of millions of dollars
of international financial aid may have been siphoned off by
President B.J. Habibie or his friends through a major bank, Bank
Bali.
</P>
<P>
   This scandal, which touches the core of Indonesians' fury at
their government's many years of abuses, strikes much closer to
home than the echoes of a distant, poorly understood conflict.
</P>
<P>
   As an international peacekeeping force prepares to enter East
Timor, there are stirrings of nationalist anger here over what many
Indonesians see as foreign meddling in their sovereign affairs. But
the former Portuguese colony, 1,000 miles away, has never been at
the center of public concern.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor, a tiny territory of only 800,000 people, has been
important primarily to the military, which has fought
unsuccessfully for 24 years to subdue it, and to diplomats who for
24 years have faced condemnation from abroad for human rights
abuses there.
</P>
<P>
   But most people have little understanding of the history or of
current events in East Timor, which was invaded by Indonesia in
1975 and which has been swept by violence since it voted for
independence two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who cares?'' said Yohannes Gunawan, 51, a ribbon manufacturer.
``Let them kill each other.''
</P>
<P>
   But indeed, a growing number of Indonesians are beginning to
care about East Timor, affronted not by the killings or the failure
of their military but by what they see as meddling and arrogance by
foreign countries _ particularly Indonesia's neighbor, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Some people here are feeling pushed around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, my colleagues here, my family, we are so angry,'' said
Becky Hendardi, a travel agent. ``We are so disgusted with the
foreigners. They are saying so many bad things about my country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, yeah, maybe that's true,'' she said about the reports of
killings and atrocities there. But she said that this was the
normal cost of war and that it was difficult to apportion blame.
</P>
<P>
   Puri Sri Purwati, an editorial researcher, said Indonesians were
taking the reports of atrocities in stride because ``we have known
for a long time that this is how the military behaves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When something has been going on for a long time, you get used
to it and take it for granted,'' she said. ``That's not very nice,
but that's what is happening right now.''
</P>
<P>
   An unsubstantiated notion that the United Nations, which
conducted the referendum, manipulated the vote has quickly taken
root here in the fertile soil of ignorance and defensiveness. The
main evidence people give is the surprisingly lopsided outcome.
``Seventy-eight point five percent?'' said Ms. Hendardi, the travel
agent. ``We don't believe that. Maybe 50-50. But this we do not
believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, she, too was far more concerned about the bank
scandal. ``It makes me so embarrassed, Bank Bali,'' she said. ``It
shows that they changed the Suharto regime but they did not change
the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Most political analysts believe that widely held sentiments like
this have doomed Habibie's hopes to win a new term in an electoral
assembly scheduled to begin in October.
</P>
<P>
   The mess in East Timor, which grew out of his offer of an
immediate referendum and which has turned much of the military
against him, seems to be another blow to his prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Beleaguered as it is, though, the government has not for the
most part been playing to nationalist emotions over East Timor, and
most newspapers have been measured in their editorials.
</P>
<P>
   For four days, small, rowdy demonstrations have been held at the
U.N. building and at the embassies of Australia and the United
States. But these crowds have clearly been recruited and organized
by factions opposed to East Timorese independence.
</P>
<P>
   More heated and spontaneous have been a series of student
protests in recent days outside Parliament, where deputies are
debating a bill that would expand the emergency powers of the
military. Like the Bank Bali scandal, this is an issue that arouses
real passions.
</P>
<P>
   For just this one moment in history, it seems that East Timor,
an obscure territory at the far corner of the Indian Ocean, is of
more concern to the distant outside world than to many of
Indonesia's citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia has more than enough to be concerned about these days,
with a foundering economy and a democratic transition that could
degenerate at any moment into violence and chaos.
</P>
<P>
   For many who keep up with the news, those are the issues that
matter. For the great mass of the population, a thousand local
concerns take precedence. ``East Timor is not the big news today in
Ujungpandang,'' said a foreign aid worker who was visiting that
city on the island of Sulawesi on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Ujungpandang,'' he said, ``people are talking about
Ujungpandang, for the most part.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Chip Gillette found his worlds colliding
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette rushed to a church that would become the site of the
worst mass shooting in Fort Worth history as a police officer, a
family man, a deacon and minister. They all came together in
several horrifying minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the church were a gunman, Gillette's wife and 15-year-old
daughter and a congregation of friends he had worshipped with since
moving to Fort Worth 16 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I saw it all, until I saw people in my church dying
and I was walking over corpses,'' said Gillette, 45. ``It was just
gruesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 7 p.m., Gillette settled on the couch for a quick
nap before leaving for his midnight shift as a police Weed and Seed
officer in east Fort Worth. Then, his dog began to bark.
</P>
<P>
   Believing that someone was at the door, Gillette said, he walked
to the front room and found the family's 4-year-old yellow
Labrador, Jake, staring out the window and ``barking like crazy''
atop a hope chest. The dog's gaze focused on Wedgwood Baptist
Church across the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every hair from the tip of his nose down his back was sticking
straight up like a razorback hog,'' Gillette said.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette looked out to see dazed adults walking out from the
west door of the church. He would later learn that the adults had
mistakenly believed that the shots were coming from outside.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette said he headed to the church to investigate wearing a
shirt, shorts and no shoes. He spotted a friend who yelled at
Gillette to get the department's SWAT team because ``someone was
inside shooting and killing people.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone opened the church's glass door to flee, and popping
sounds became audible to Gillette. He turned to see a person down
just inside the church's glass door and immediately ran home for
his bulletproof vest, gun and uniform shirt. He radioed for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I could think about was I had my family over there and
other kids I know,'' Gillette said.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Gillette had just ducked into the church office to inform
a youth pastor that his wife had been involved in a car wreck when
the shooting started. Daughter Kimberly was inside the sanctuary
attending the youth rally. Debbie Gillette helped rush teens out of
the sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, her husband had returned to the church. He and
another officer arrived and entered the church's south side.
Gillette said he heard one last gunshot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last pop was him shooting himself,'' Gillette said. ``I
made entry immediately afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillette, a 13-year veteran of the Police Department, declined
to discuss what he saw inside the church, pending the
investigation. He said he did not recognize the gunman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's never been here before. He's never been to a worship
service. His tie to the church is completely arbitrary at this
point,'' Gillette said.
</P>
<P>
   After things had calmed down, Gillette searched under the pews
and around the sanctuary for his daughter and wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know who was up or down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He later found them safe. Other friends weren't so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unreal. People I love and worship and pray with are going
to be affected forever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the shooting, Gillette said, he has been inside the church
two or three times with investigators sharing his recollections.
Despite the traumatic experience, Gillette said, he planned to work
Thursday night unless his supervisors objected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fine,'' Gillette said. ``There are other friends we know
who have lost lives and lost family members. They're the ones I'm
concerned about.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillette, a church deacon and minister who occasionally performs
weddings, said he worries that Wedgwood Baptist Church will be
remembered only as one of many mass shooting sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like that stigma: Wedgwood just being a blip in
history, one in many,'' Gillette said. ``That's not what Wedgwood
is all about. This one incident doesn't make Wedgwood, it doesn't
destroy Wedgwood, and it doesn't change anything.'' &QL;

SHOOTINGS ROCK FORT WORTH BAPTIST SEMINARY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ ``Precious people, precious people _ they
all were precious people,'' the Rev. Al Meredith said through his
tears Thursday, grieving with a shocked Baptist seminary after
several current and former students were gunned down in his church
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   During an emotional chapel service at Southwestern Baptist
Theological Seminary, Meredith joined about 2,000 students and
faculty members in prayers for the victims of the Wednesday night
shootings at Wedgwood Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Two seminary students, Shawn Brown and Susan Kimberly Jones,
both 23, were among the dead. So was Sydney Browning, 36, who
graduated from the Fort Worth seminary two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Two other seminarians _ Jeff Laster, and Kevin Galey, who was a
teaching fellow at the graduate training institution, were wounded
when a gunman burst into the church during a ``See You at the
Pole'' youth rally. Larry Gene Ashbrook, 47, fatally shot seven
people and wounded seven others before committing suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Seminary President Ken Hemphill, his voice breaking with
emotion, said the seminary is offering all the help it can to the
church.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things we don't understand,'' Hemphill said.
``But we do know that God is still on his throne and is our
strength and a very present help in time of trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Meredith knelt on stage and several seminary students and
professors knelt with him, the closest putting their arms around
his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Groggy from lack of sleep, Meredith paused for a moment to gain
his composure when he first started to speak. But the students
encouraged him with their applause.
</P>
<P>
   Many seminary faculty members and students had been up all
night, counseling and helping victims' families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Dickens, associate professor of pastoral ministries, stayed
up all night counseling his family and others after being
personally touched by the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Kristin, 15, was at the rally and saw one of her
best friends killed.
</P>
<P>
   Seminary student Vickie Stewart, who lives in the same campus
dormitory as Jones, said many dorm residents were up late Wednesday
night crying and praying when they learned that Jones was among the
dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a shock,'' said Stewart, 36. She said many students
knew that Jones and about four other students had gone to the
Wedgwood church for the Wednesday night prayer service and began to
worry as they watched the news on television.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Jones' room was a Bible verse she had copied on a small
message board: ``Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil. Cling to
what is good. Be devoted to one another in brotherly love. Romans
12:9-10.''
</P>
<P>
   After the prayer service, Meredith said grief-stricken members
of his church will recover from the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Satan means for evil, God means for good,'' he said. ``It
will grieve us and sadden us, but it is not going to stop us. Out
of all this misery of darkness, we will come out stronger.'' &QL;

RECRUITING A REFERENCE  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 19)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By MICHELLE COTTLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What can a job seeker do when a past employers won't give any
information to a potential new one _ beyond, of course, your job
title and dates of employment? I have run into this problem with
the preschool where I previously worked. The board decided to no
longer let the director give references, which would be valuable to
me in applying to a school system. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: Take heart. Your job-hunting problem has become so common
that it almost fails to qualify as a handicap any more. Fearing
lawsuits, many companies are now reluctant to give an official
reference beyond name, rank and serial number, said Sheila Pianin,
a job search consultant in New York.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean you can slide by without having someone vouch
for your abilities. ``You just have to get a little more
resourceful about who you ask,'' said Robin Ryan, a career
counselor in Seattle and the author of ``24 Hours to Your Next Job,
Raise, or Promotion'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   Company policy notwithstanding, a peer or supervisor may be
willing to provide an unofficial reference, the experts said. Ms.
Ryan suggested one path: ``Go to a boss or former boss who's
sympathetic to the fact that you're trying to move on and say, `I
know the company's not supposed to do anything formally, but would
you be a reference if someone called you at home?'''
</P>
<P>
   Or you could ask someone to write you a letter of
recommendation, Ms. Pianin said. Individual letters noting your
qualifications for specific jobs are best, but even a generic
letter is better than nothing. At the very least, you may be able
to find copies of old job evaluations or letters of praise from a
supervisor, Ms. Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   If colleagues fear that giving even an informal reference will
get them in trouble, look outside. At a school, you may find ``a
parent who worked on a committee or who was a volunteer there and
saw you in action on a daily basis,'' Ms. Ryan said. People in the
corporate world can recruit clients, vendors and consultants to
sing their praises. Former co-workers who have moved on to other
companies can also prove invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   Don't bother with personal references, Ms. Ryan said. Unless you
are asked specifically for character references unrelated to a job,
having a potential employer call your friends (even important,
successful ones) is essentially worthless. ``The person must be
familiar with your work and your ability to do the job,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Keep searching until you have a list of at least three people
willing to testify to your professional greatness, Ms. Ryan said.
When references become an issue in the interview process, offer the
hiring manager the list. Explain to her that, when calling your
most recent employer for an official reference, she can expect to
be shuffled off to the human resources department and given only
basic information.

CLINTON ANGERS GOP LAWMAKERS BY INVOKING EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Asserting executive privilege, President Clinton on
Thursday rebuffed a congressional request for information about his
controversial decision to grant clemency to members of a violent
Puerto Rican nationalist group.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's refusal to fully cooperate angered Republican
lawmakers who are pushing investigations into whether the clemency
offer was designed to help first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's
anticipated bid for the Senate in New York, home to about 1.3
million Puerto Rican expatriates.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to invoke executive privilege was the fourth time
since early 1996 that Clinton has refused to provide information to
a congressional committee. He also used the privilege during two
grand jury investigations of the Monica Lewinsky affair and former
Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's authority to grant clemency is not subject to
legislative oversight,'' White House deputy counsel Cheryl Mills
said in a letter to Rep. Dan Burton. The House Government Reform
Committee, chaired by Burton, last week subpoenaed administration
records and White House Counsel Beth Nolan.
</P>
<P>
   Mills pointed out in her letter that some documents were being
provided, but they ``are not directly related'' to the president's
clemency power or to communication with aides and other
administration officials who provided advice before Clinton made
the clemency offer.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said Nolan would not be appearing before Burton's
committee.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said more than 10,000 pages of documents
related to the decision were being forwarded to Burton's committee.
Included are thousands of letters urging Clinton to show leniency
toward the prisoners, most of whom are members of FLAN, a Puerto
Rican separatist group.
</P>
<P>
   The group, formally known as the Armed Forces of National
Liberation, is blamed for 130 bombings in the Chicago and New York
areas from 1974 to 1983. Six people were killed in the attacks and
dozens were injured. None of the 16 offered clemency were convicted
of killing or wounding anyone, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Burton and other Republicans, sidestepping the constitutional
issues raised by Mills, instead accused Clinton of misusing
executive privilege to hide information from Congress and the
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``By claiming executive privilege he is, in essence, telling the
American people that it's none of their business,'' Burton said.
``The president has a moral obligation ... to explain why he let
terrorists out of prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Vito Fossella, a New York Republican, said, ``If the
president genuinely believes his clemency deal was justified, I
find it curious that he would choose to stonewall Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Fossella last week steered through the House a resolution,
adopted 311-41, condemning Clinton's decision to release the Puerto
Ricans after they renounced violence. A similar resolution critical
of the president's action was approved Tuesday by the Senate, 95-2.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Mills' letter arrived on Capitol Hill, the Senate
Judiciary Committee, chaired by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, postponed
until next week a vote on whether to subpoena documents and
testimony from the White House officials regarding Clinton's
clemency offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is whether or not we're going to let the committee
be stiffed,'' said Hatch.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the call for Clinton to drop his executive privilege
claim was Sen. Robert Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat and member
of the Judiciary Committee who has criticized the president's
clemency decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the committee will learn more about his motivations and
the process so that it's never repeated,'' Torricelli said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno argued that Clinton was on strong
legal ground, citing Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution. It
lists pardoning prisoners as one of the few specific powers granted
exclusively to the president. In addition, Reno said, the courts
have consistently said within certain limits the president is
entitled to confidential communication with aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House staff and the Department of Justice act as
confidential advisers to the president as part of the clemency
review process,'' Reno said in a six-page letter to Clinton.
``Executive privilege has long been understood to protect
confidential advice generated during that process.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's clemency decision, which relied heavily on research
and advice by former White House Counsel Charles Ruff, has drawn
criticism since it was announced last month. Republicans and
several law enforcement officers, including some who were
disfigured and disabled by the FLAN bombings, accused the president
of trying to help Hillary Clinton's impending Senate bid.
</P>
<P>
   As the firestorm grew, Hillary Clinton joined in criticizing the
clemency offer, which angered Puerto Rican leaders in New York.
Last week, she explained that she should have consulted Latino
leaders before taking a side on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart on Thursday repeated earlier
White House denials that the New York Senate race was considered
when Clinton decided to offer clemency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say it absolutely and unequivocally that this case was
based on the merits as presented by the former (White House)
counsel Chuck Ruff, and the politics of New York or anywhere did
not come into play,'' Lockhart said.

TO BLOW THE WHISTLE, DROP THE MASK  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 19)
</HEADLINE>
  
(Attn: Conn., Nev.) (Eds: Please note subslug for ETHICS-COLUMN) 
(af) 
 By JEFFREY L. SEGLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Insiders who see something rotten occurring in a company or
organization have a clear ethical obligation to speak up. But does
that obligation include disclosing your identity?
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to find reasons for wanting to remain anonymous.
Consider what happened in the case of Jeffrey Wigand, who repaid
Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco, for firing him as head of research in
1993 by spilling some very embarrassing beans, including evidence
that the company's chief executive, Thomas E. Sandefur Jr., who
died in 1996, lied to Congress about what the company knew about
tobacco's addictive properties. Wigand said a firestorm of
invective and threats _ both legal and physical _ descended on him
and his family.
</P>
<P>
   By coming forward in a very public way, Wigand paved the way for
the first successful litigation against the tobacco companies over
the dangers of smoking. But he did so at a steep personal price.
Other potential whistle-blowers might look at his experience and
say, ``I'll talk only if I can keep my name out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   That may seem expedient, but it's the wrong way, for both
practical and ethical reasons. In most cases, violent crimes being
an obvious exception, the encouragement of anonymous tipsterism is
misguided.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the ethics: If you believe something is wrong and
must change, anonymity should not be a prerequisite for coming
forward. ``If the fear of retaliation causes us not to stand up for
our principles,'' said Stephen L. Carter, a Yale law professor and
author of ``Integrity'' (Basic Books, 1996), ``then what kind of
principles are they?''
</P>
<P>
   They certainly won't be upheld by a complaint that goes ignored.
And anonymous allegations are easily brushed aside as the work of
someone with ignoble motives, like a disgruntled employee or a
competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Wigand's whistle-blowing had the effect it did because people
could see that it came from someone in a position to know, said
Terance D. Miethe, a professor of criminal justice at the
University of Nevada at Las Vegas and the author of
``Whistle-Blowing at Work'' (Westview, 1999). ``The problem with
anonymous reporting,'' he said, ``is that usually no action is
taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Even advocacy groups set up to protect whistle-blowers, like the
Government Accountability Project in Washington, recognize that the
efficacy of complaints is tied to an identified source. Tom Devine,
the project's legal director, said that he advises whistle-blowers
to ``stay anonymous as long as possible'' but that, sooner or
later, ``if you truly want to make a difference, you're going to
have to publicly bear witness and testify.''
</P>
<P>
   Groups like Devine's exist because retaliation does occur. The
Merit System Protection Board, a civil service panel, conducted a
1992 survey of nearly 1,500 federal employees who had reported what
they saw as misconduct. Twenty-three percent said they had
experienced verbal harassment or intimidation; 1 percent said they
had been dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   There is some legal protection for whistle-blowers under federal
and state laws, but it generally applies only to those who report
possible violations of laws to the authorities. If you report to
top executives, say, that your boss is falsely claiming credit for
another's work, you're on your own.
</P>
<P>
   Even with statutory protection against official retaliation,
there is nothing to stop co-workers from making a whistle-blower's
life less than comfortable. After all, no law can make people
befriend those who take a righteous stand.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some experts, including Miethe, believe that the laws
themselves are a dismal failure. Unlike most lone employees,
companies can afford to pay lawyers to tie up cases for years.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick J. Gnazzo vice president for business practices at
United Technologies in Hartford, said he believes that companies
can benefit from encouraging, not squashing, whistle-blowers. ``In
a perfect world, an employee works for a company that wants to do
the right thing, and the employee is not going to feel
uncomfortable bringing things forward,'' he said. ``The problem is,
this isn't a perfect world.''
</P>
<P>
   Though some companies try to create an atmosphere in which
people feel comfortable and supported in identifying wrongdoing,
the reality is that behaving ethically can wreak havoc on a life
without any guarantee that wrongs will be righted. That is why
those who speak up, despite the risks, are seen as courageous _ and
are believed. And it is why those who cloak themselves in what
Carter calls ``a culture of anonymous complaining'' often are not. &QL;

STUDY PUTS U.S. FOOD-POISONING TOLL AT 76 MILLION YEARLY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 4th graf to change 5,000 to 9,000)  (bl) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although the United States has one of the safest
food supplies in the world, about 76 million Americans suffer food
poisoning each year and about 5,000 die from it, the federal
government said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta said
the estimates in a study it released Thursday were the most
complete ever compiled on food-borne illnesses (the agency avoided
the everyday term ``food poisoning'') and were based on many
sources, including death certificates, hospital surveys and
academic studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``These new estimates provide a snapshot of the problem and do
not measure trends and do not indicate that the problem is getting
better or worse,'' said CDC Director Jeffrey Koplan in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Mead, a bacteria specialist at the CDC, who is an
author of the study, said it contained no startling revelations
from a scientific standpoint. But there are two conclusions that
challenge earlier findings by the CDC. The agency's estimate of
annual illnesses caused by food poisoning is more than twice as
high as that suggested in earlier studies, which put the figure at
30 million. Its estimate of deaths, on the other hand, is much
lower than the old figure of 9,000.
</P>
<P>
   The study does not address the safety of imported foods. And it
does not lay blame on farmers or poultry producers or beef
processors or supermarkets or restaurants, or any other link in the
American food chain, although Mead said in a telephone interview
that updates of the study might do so in future years.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that people not be alarmed by these
statistics,'' Mead said, ``but it's also important they take steps
to avoid becoming one of the statistics.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many food-related illnesses can be avoided by cooking hamburger
thoroughly, washing kitchen cutting boards well _ especially after
they are exposed to raw meat _ and drinking only pasteurized milk,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said the
findings released Thursday should persuade Congress to enact
food-safety measures proposed by President Clinton. They include
legislation to give federal agencies greater authority over the
food industry and expand inspections and research.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The public-health burden of food-borne disease is
substantial,'' Shalala said, although she did not differ with the
study's conclusion that American food, over all, is safe.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington
consumer group, said the report showed that more than common-sense
kitchen hygiene is needed. ``The odds are 1 in 4 that you'll get
sick this year from contaminated foods,'' said Caroline Smith
DeWaal, the center's food-safety director, using the federal
government's estimate of 76 million illnesses a year. ``In today's
food-safety lottery, odds are 1 in 840 that you'll be hospitalized
and 1 in 55,000 that you'll die. Those aren't good odds for the
American public.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeWaal urged Congress to approve all the money Clinton has
requested for his program (more than $100 million) and said the
White House and Congress should go further by creating a single
powerful agency with ``farm-to-table'' authority to regulate food.
</P>
<P>
   The Grocery Manufacturers of America, a trade group representing
many big food and beverage companies, said today that it welcomed
the findings of the CDC study.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is long overdue,'' said Brian Sansoni, a
spokesman for the group. But he said the group opposed creation of
a ``super agency'' as cumbersome and unneeded.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The federal study said food-borne diseases had been grossly
underreported, in part because milder cases might be mistaken for
other illness, or because the sufferer simply did not bother to
consult a doctor once the symptoms had gone away. Even if a
sufferer does seek treatment and the illness is diagnosed as
food-borne in nature, the doctor or laboratory do not always relay
the information to public health agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Deaths from food-related diseases _ if overestimated in the past
_ have, paradoxically, also been underreported officially, the
study found.
</P>
<P>
   Mead said the study contained no striking findings about
particular kinds of foods or specific bacteria, viruses or
parasites. Not surprisingly, the study linked various strains of
salmonella to a high percentage of food-related illness.
</P>
<P>
   But Koplan said reliable information _ surprising or not _ had
never been more important. New bacteria and viruses evolve, and old
ones grow more resistant to treatment. Americans dine out more,
thus entrusting their health to strangers.
</P>
<P>
   And the baby-boomers are aging. The elderly, along with
children, are the most vulnerable to food illness.

CLINTON INVOKES EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE IN CLEMENCY PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Citing executive privilege, President Clinton on
Thursday rejected subpoenas from congressional Republicans to turn
over records of private deliberations that led him to offer
clemency last month to 16 members of a violent Puerto Rican
nationalist group.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, bolstered by an opinion from Attorney General
Janet Reno, asserted flatly that Congress had no authority over the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pursuant to the Constitution and the separation of powers
doctrine, the President's authority to grant clemency is not
subject to legislative oversight,'' Cheryl Mills, the White House
deputy counsel, wrote to Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who is chairman
of the Committee on Government Reform, which subpoenaed the
records.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ms. Mills said, the White House is spurning the
committee's subpoena for Beth Nolan, the president's new chief
counsel, to testify on the matter. But administration officials
said on Thursday night that three other officials will appear next
week at hearings by the panel although they will not testify to
matters considered confidential.
</P>
<P>
   The White House will release some documents not covered by
executive privilege, but administration officials did not give a
detailed description of them.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans reacted angrily to the rebuff. Burton
accused the president of hiding behind the shield of executive
privilege to avoid giving the public a full explanation of why he
granted clemency to the militants _ a move that Burton said runs
counter to the interests of the United States and its security.
</P>
<P>
   This was the fourth time the Clinton administration has asserted
executive privilege in response to demands from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said in an interview that while the president has a right
to claim executive privilege, he also has a moral obligation to
tell the public why he freed people who were members of a terrorist
organization that killed or maimed nearly 90 people in bombings in
the 1970s and 1980s. None of the 16 prisoners was convicted of
violent acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people deserve an explanation, and he's thumbing
his nose at them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have privately delighted in the political chaos that
the matter has caused for Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is almost
certainly running for the U.S. Senate from New York. Mrs. Clinton
at first supported the clemency offer then opposed it, incensing
many Puerto Rican members of Congress. Two new polls show that
large majorities of voters, both nationally and in New York,
disapproved of the clemency offer. And more view Mrs. Clinton's
handling of the episode unfavorably than favorably.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said that even if administration officials refused to
discuss the decision-making process, he would issue subpoenas on
Friday for representatives of the Justice Department, the FBI and
the Bureau of Prisons to appear on Tuesday to provide as much
documentation as they could about the prisoners' backgrounds and
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Several top law-enforcement officials recommended against the
clemency, and Burton wants to get that on the record. He also said
his committee had video tape of two of the prisoners making bombs
in 1983 and that he intended for the public to see that tape.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Judiciary Committee also plans to issue subpoenas for
documents and testimony regarding the clemency case, according to
its chairman, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Myron Marlin, a Justice Department spokesman, said that the
department officials would appear but would not testify regarding
advice given to the president or deliberative communications. Those
to be subpoenaed are Jon Jennings, acting assistant attorney
general; Neil Gallagher, the FBI's assistant director for
terrorism, and Michael Cooksey, an assistant director at the Bureau
of Prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, dismissed Burton's
action as politically motivated. ``I don't really know what
legislative accomplishments he's had in his tenure as chairman,''
Lockhart said. ``But I can tell you that we've gotten something
like 700 subpoenas from him. He has publicly stated that his
mission is to get the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans concede that the clemency matter is
more or less moot now, since 11 of the 16 prisoners have been
released. Still, they have sought to keep the matter alive as a
rare instance of a political miscalculation by a president who,
some suggest, seemed unaware of the kind of backlash that such a
move would create in the minefield of New York politics and among
law-and-order advocates.
</P>
<P>
   The president said last week that he was responding to
humanitarian calls for the prisoners' release, that they had served
long enough, that none of them had done anyone ``bodily harm'' and
that they were being punished excessively for ``guilt by
association'' with terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   But his response seems to have satisfied few and only fueled his
critics.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's likely Senate opponent, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
the Republican mayor of New York City, excoriated the president on
Thursday for trying to ``conceal'' the basis of his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's taking a very, very questionable and bizarre situation
and making it appear even more questionable and bizarre,'' the
mayor said. ``He has never granted clemency before in any serious
case. All of a sudden he does, and now he wants to not release the
documents from which he made the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said that Clinton's invocation of executive privilege
should not suggest anything untoward in his decision-making
process, rejecting any suggestions that the president offered the
clemency to help his wife win the support of Puerto Rican voters.
He said the president had every right to receive advice
confidentially.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As he has in the past, Lockhart noted that the president's
decision was based on a recommendation from Charles F.C. Ruff, who
was his counsel until a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say absolutely and unequivocally that this case was
based on the merits as presented by the former counsel, Chuck Ruff,
and the politics of New York or anywhere did not come into play,''
Lockhart asserted. Ruff has not returned phone calls on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's three previous claims of privilege were all in 1996
and pertained to the White House travel office firings, a
memorandum to the president on drug enforcement, and policy
regarding Haiti.

`RETURN WITH HONOR' IS AN EXTRAORDINARY EPIC SAGA OF PRISON
SURVIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   No single issue or event of the Vietnam War was more emotional,
more politicized or more quickly turned into the fodder of bad
Hollywood action movies than the long ordeal of the American POWs
in Hanoi. Their real and human story has never been told, at least
on film.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Return With Honor,'' an absorbing, sobering documentary
that begins a theatrical engagement on Friday, does just that. It
allows the POWs to calmly tell their own story in their own words.
</P>
<P>
   And no matter where you may stand on the still-controversial
war, the results make an extraordinary epic saga of prison
survival, in its own way as gripping, horrifying and inspiring as
such classics of the genre as ``Papillon'' and ``Birdman of
Alcatraz.''
</P>
<P>
   It also has an eerie veracity made possible by the Vietnamese
government's decision to release, after all these years, its own
film of the POW experience, including some dramatic footage of the
actual capture of downed pilots, initial debriefings and the
day-to-day routine at the Hanoi Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   So, as the middle-aged ex-prisoners _ some two dozen in all,
some imprisoned as long as eight and a half years _ sit before a
black background and give their personal reminiscences, the
testimony is frequently intercut with the actual Vietnam prison
footage.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these faces are famous, and some of the scenes are
emotional and intimate. For instance, there's Arizona senator and
presidential hopeful John McCain being paraded through the streets,
lying wounded on a cot, wincing with pain, and telling his captors'
camera he loves his wife.
</P>
<P>
   And Commander James Stockdale, who retired an admiral and ran as
Ross Perot's running mate in 1992, driven to such despair by the
isolation and torture that he admits to attempting suicide.
(Stockdale has reportedly since criticized the film for being
``superficial.'')
</P>
<P>
   The stories themselves are amazingly free of self-serving
bluster, and deal less with chest-beating heroism in the face of
torture as with the innovative ways the prisoners found to stay in
communication with each other, developing complicated systems of
code their captors never did crack.
</P>
<P>
   As directed and written by the husband-wife team of Freida Lee
Mock and Terry Sanders (who won an Oscar for ``Maya Lin: A Strong
Clear Vision''), the film honors the ex-prisoners and subtly
celebrates their steadfastness, but never tries to paint them as
heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Emotionally, the film forces us to step inside the POWs' shoes
and see the war and the homefront tumult from their point of view,
and understand how they came to feel that the best they could hope
to get out of their impossible situation was survival with some
semblance of their honor intact.
</P>
<P>
   Return With Honor. Directed and produced by Freida Lee Mock and
Terry Sanders. Screenplay by Freida Lee Mock, Terry Sanders and
Christine Z. Wiser. Documentary. Banner Entertainment. 102 minutes.
Unrated.

 &HT;    Traffic nightmare greets evacuees returning to Georgia homes
 &HT;    By Brad Schrade, Steve Visser and Jingle Davis
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ga. _ In a few weeks, the tales of the great Hurricane
Floyd evacuation will become chatter at cocktail parties, on golf
course tees and between halves of high school football games.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Thursday's bright sun and cloudless blue sky over
Middle and east Georgia was changing dispositions _ and perhaps,
recollections _ of how more than 2 million people fled coastal
Georgia earlier this week as Floyd threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Interstate 16 _ which became the main evacuation route from
Savannah on Tuesday when all lanes were made westbound _ was moving
eastbound slowly but consistently on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy traffic was on I-75 south. Starting about 20 miles
south of Atlanta, I-75 was clogged with evacuees driving home.
</P>
<P>
   State Department of Transportation spokeswoman Karen Mashburn
said southeast Georgia highways were ``saturated'' by 10 a.m., two
hours after the state officially reopened major highways. Even amid
the rush to get to their coastal homes, Georgians were showing
their senses of humor.
</P>
<P>
   In gridlocked traffic on U.S. 82 between Brunswick and Nahunta,
car radios blasted as drivers got out on the roadside and boogied
down. Some opened well-stocked coolers, prompting other thirsty
refugees to hold up hand-lettered signs saying, ``Will work for
beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Moochie Nicholson, who stopped briefly in this Middle Georgia
town during her trip from her relatives' home in Snellville to
Ellabell, was returning with a bounty: a couch and chair
Nicholson's sister had given her during the two-day stay. ``Well,
it was worth my trip,'' said Nicholson, during a coffee stop at
Burger King in this Middle Georgia town. ``We got something out of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson, 52, her husband and her daughter's family were
traveling in a two-truck, one car caravan. Given that Nicholson had
fled her Savannah area home with a gun, a pet bird, a pull golf
cart and pictures of her grandchildren, she needed the extra
vehicles for the furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Howard traveled from Atlanta to Savannah in a three-car
caravan with her family. The 49-year-old Savannah native has been
through other storms, but never evacuated before.
</P>
<P>
   She said you find out what's important to people by what they
place in the back of their car or truck when doom is near. ``We've
seen people haul boats, motorcycles, tractors,'' Howard said.
``It's amazing to see how important pets are to people. I saw one
lady with a snake, bird, dogs, even kittens.''
</P>
<P>
   Near here, along I-16, which was a virtual parking lot when the
evacuation hit full stride Tuesday, there were remnants of that
frustrating, crawling exodus. Broken-down cars pointed east sat on
the interstate shoulders in both directions _ a reminder of the
road's part in the largest peacetime movement of people in U.S.
history.
</P>
<P>
   Despite stalled cars, hungry children, sick babies and
complaints about unscrupulous innkeepers who overcharged or sold
rooms more than once, many who fled Floyd said they would do it all
over again.
</P>
<P>
   They would just plan better by making sure they had food,
blankets and motel reservations closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Hiers and her daughter, 21-year-old Laura Cowart, said
they have no desire to test whether the government is right when it
orders a mandatory evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was a Category 3 hurricane and it was a voluntary
evacuation, we wouldn't leave,'' said the 44-year-old Hiers. ``But
if it was a storm like this, we'd leave again. We live on Tybee
Island, and we'd have been wiped out if it had hit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our house would have been under water,'' Cowart said. ``But I
wouldn't go as far as I did. I would go to Statesboro, not
Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen-year-old Lauren Lattany of Brunswick said her family had
to drive all the way to Athens, Tenn., to find a hotel room because
none were available as far north as Rome and Dalton. They returned
home late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything in Brunswick was the same except nobody was
there,'' she said. ``The power was on and everything. It was an
extreme relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Emergency management directors in the coastal counties echoed
that sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Abel, director of the Brunswick-Glynn County Emergency
Management Agency, said Floyd left behind only a few power outages
and minor beach erosion. He said he heard of only one tree crashing
into a home.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people coming back today don't even think anything
happened here,'' Abel said.
</P>
<P>
   But emergency management officials were careful not to suggest
that future evacuation orders should be delayed.
</P>
<P>
   An eight-member family from Brunswick who traveled to Atlanta in
two cars said it was crazy to stay and risk the destruction
threatened by Floyd. They were worried more about the possibility
their homes and trailers had been looted _ figuring folks who
ignored a mandatory evacuation might be the type to break the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``They capitalize on your misery,'' said Phyllis Sams, 33.
``They wait back and steal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricane skipped Savannah. And that put some of the
returnees in a sour mood.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Williamson, 26, of Savannah spent 12 hours Tuesday on the
road to Charlotte, N.C., normally a four-hour trip for her. If
another hurricane threatens, count Williamson out of the traffic
mess on I-16. ``Putting 3 million people on the same road at the
same time is ridiculous,'' said Williamson.
</P>
<P>
   Many were simply happy to be going home. And already, the
evacuation stories were getting grander with each telling.
</P>
<P>
   The Savannah-to-Atlanta trip in gridlocked traffic took 12
hours, 14, or 18 hours, depending on the telling. But why try to
quantify the trip when a succinct description was available?
</P>
<P>
   ``I got one word to sum it up: hell,'' said Jameela Lewis, who
was getting take-out from the Huddle House at Exit 26. ``I hate to
say it like that. But that's the way it was.''
</P>
<P>
   There also were tales about the kindness of strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Bukowski, his wife and her parents were stuck in traffic
on the way to Macon on Tuesday when 7-month-old Donovan began
crying and their doubts about getting to Macon got stronger.
Bukowski looked up to see the minister of Irwinton Baptist Church
putting up a shelter sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people were the nicest people I've ever met,'' Bukowski
said of the congregation. ``If I could send them a Medal of Honor,
I would.''
</P>
<P>
   At Clary's, a cafe near Savannah's historic district, Mayor
Floyd Adams Jr. consoled constituents during Thursday's lunch hour.
Adams pledged that the city would find more sensible hurricane
escape methods next time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a few glitches,'' said Adams. ``But we learned a
great deal. We just have to apply that knowledge to future
endeavors.''
</P>
<P>
   Miriam Center, sitting nearby, said government officials and the
news media alarmed the public without much justification.
</P>
<P>
   Back at a Subway restaurant here, where Shelia Wisener, her
three kids and mother in-law had stopped for lunch, Wisener's Chevy
Suburban was packed to the roof with blankets, her china, photos,
important papers and snacks.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she would unpack when she got home to Savannah,
she paused, perhaps thinking about Hurricane Gert, which is far out
to sea and expected to curve east of Bermuda and stay away from the
East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think until the season's over, I'll leave some of it
packed,'' Wisener said. ``I don't want to pack it all again.''

TEXAS SHOOTER WAS ANGRY LONER, NEIGHBORS SAY  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The man who walked into the Wedgwood Baptist
Church here on Wednesday did not look like he belonged to the
congregation. No one apparently knew Larry Gene Ashbrook or what
this man in blue jeans and a black leather jacket might want.
People would later learn that he was a jobless loner, an ex-sailor
prone to foul moods and feared by several of his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   But at that moment, the only thing that seemed strange was that
he was smoking a cigarette in church. A janitor approached him
about the cigarette, and the authorities say Ashbrook shot him. He
shot a woman sitting nearby in the head. And then he followed the
sounds of music and voices into the main sanctuary where hundreds
of teen-agers had gathered for a contemporary Christian music
concert. He walked inside and began firing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were crying,'' said Bob Bollinger, a Sunday school
director. ``They didn't understand it. They were in shock.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the night was over, seven people were killed, three
of them teen-agers, and Ashbrook became the eighth fatality when he
turned the gun on himself. Seven other people were wounded, two of
whom remained in critical condition Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators gathered evidence about Ashbrook's rampage and
as local officials sought to comfort a grieving city, the suspect
emerged as an angry, desperate man who apparently had called two
local newspapers in recent months to say he fantasized about serial
killers.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton decried the attack and offered
the nation's sympathy to the victims, their families and the people
of Fort Worth. ``Yet again, we have seen a sanctuary violated by
gun violence, taking children brimming with faith and promise and
hope, before their time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential front runner,
canceled campaign appearances in Michigan and went to Wedgwood
Baptist Thursday afternoon to comfort the families of the victims.
Even as people expressed horror that such a brutal attack could
happen in a house of worship, Fort Worth Mayor Kenneth Barr alluded
to the recent string of mass shootings across the country, notably
the school attack at Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fort Worth isn't the first place to have this kind of
tragedy,'' Barr said. ``My great fear is it won't be the last.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Mendoza, the Fort Worth acting police chief, said
Ashbrook, 47, apparently screamed insults about ``the Baptist
religion'' during the shooting, but investigators had not yet
discerned his motives. Ashbrook did not leave a suicide note or any
written evidence of his intentions, the police chief said. He lived
several miles from Wedgwood Baptist, and members of the church had
no idea why he chose them as a target.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was saying, `Your religion is nothing, it's not worth
anything, it means nothing,''' said Mary Beth Talley, 17, who was
wounded in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Local police and federal agents with the FBI and the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Thursday morning searched the home
Ashbrook had shared with his late parents and uncovered the raw
materials for a pipe bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said Ashbrook threw a pipe bomb into the front of the
sanctuary during his attack. As details from the shootings emerged,
church members told of acts of heroism. As Ashbrook sprayed bullets
from two handguns, teenagers ducked for cover in the pews. But
Heather McDonald, a young woman with Down's Syndrome, remained
sitting upright, apparently confused. Ms. Talley shielded the girl
with her body as the suspect fired and hit her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just kept saying to Heather, `You've got to be quiet and
stay down with me,''' Ms. Talley said Thursday. Even after she was
shot, Ms. Talley kept comforting her friend. ``I just wanted to
make sure she was calm.''
</P>
<P>
   Another church member, S.M. ``Chip'' Gillette, was watching
television in his nearby home when he noticed his dog, Jake,
standing atop a chest and barking furiously at the window. An off
duty Fort Worth police officer, Gillette saw people streaming out
of the church. He radioed for police help, grabbed his service
revolver and rushed inside the front door with a uniformed officer
who had just arrived at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette said he ran toward the gunshots and arrived just after
Ashbrook shot himself as he sat in a back pew of the church.
Investigators said Ashbrook used semi-automatic handguns, a 9 mm
Ruger and a .380-caliber AMT. He fired at least 30 shots, and
officers found 10 Ruger ammunition clips in his pockets and near
his body. He bought both guns in February 1992 at licensed firearms
dealers in a flea market-type operation called Trader's Village,
just outside Forth Worth, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that Ashbrook may have brought more than one pipe bomb
into the church, investigators had sent in robotic bomb-sweeping
equipment in the hours after the attack. No other explosives were
found, and the bodies of the victims were removed from the
sanctuary early Thursday morning, about five hours after the
attack.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; (MORE)
</P>
<P>
   To a large degree, Ashbrook remains a puzzle to investigators.
At least publicly, Mendoza and other officials said they weren't
certain of his motives. However, he had apparently called the local
Fort Worth Star-Telegram and an alternative newspaper, FW Weekly in
recent months. In an angry, rambling discourse, Ashbrook told a
reporter at FW Weekly that he fantasized about serial killers,
particularly Ricky Lee Green, a mass murderer who was from Fort
Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook lived in modest brick ranch house in Forest Hill, a
lower middle class incorporated bedroom community in southeast Fort
Worth, about seven miles from the church. At age 47, Ashbrook was
the youngest of five siblings, and he lived at home with his
elderly father, Jack, until he died two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   His father had retired after 35 years as a switchman for the
Missouri-Kansas-Texas railroad, and had been a fixture at the
Pleasant Ridge Church of Christ for 40 years. Neighbors said the
suspect had been close to his mother, Ethel Muriel Ashbrook, who
died in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could never tell what kind of mood swing he was in, so I
kept away from him,'' said Venita Hord, 50, who lived directly
across the street. ``I never did trust him.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, as Mrs. Hord and another neighbor sat in her
yard, Ashbrook pulled up and saw them laughing. Apparently thinking
he was laughing at him, he slammed shut his car door and unzipped
his pants, exposing himself. Mrs. Hord said she had not spoken to
him since, even though she saw him almost every day.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said Ashbrook had apparently never been treated for any
mental illness nor sought any such help. His police record shows
only one arrest, a 1971 conviction for marijuana possession.
</P>
<P>
   Records show that Ashbrook had a spotty education record and was
in and out of the U.S. Navy. He enrolled in Tarrant County College
in 1971, when he was 19, taking classes in remedial English,
creative design, math, guitar and physical education. He served at
least two stints in the Navy, the second from 1977 to 1983,
according to a spokesman for the Department of Veterans Affairs in
Dallas. In the Navy, he was a sonar operator on a P-3 Orion plane.
That type of plane tracks and destroys enemy submarines.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said he rarely spoke to anyone. Mrs. Horde said she
knew when he was home because he always slammed the door shut and
often kicked it open. She said she could hear the noise across the
street. Other neighbors often heard him arguing with his father,
sometimes over borrowing his car. And everyone noticed one strange
habit: he always carried a blue canvas bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never knew what his attitude would be,'' said Janet
Gabhardt, 28, another neighbor. Asked if she was shocked that
Ashbrook had become violent, she said, ``I wasn't shocked, I wasn't
shocked at all.'' Childhood friends remembered him as a loner and
an oddball who mumbled and talked to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry had turned weird,'' said James Branum, who grew up a
block away and last saw Ashbrook six months ago. ``He was always
strange to me a little bit.'' Branum and others said he never held
a steady job. ``He wouldn't work,'' Branum said. ``When his daddy
died he got the house because nobody was left, but he couldn't pay
for it. I guess he figured everything was so bad he took his own
life. It's so sad with all these kids.''

   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ The heart of Hurricane Floyd raked across the
mainland here at Cape Fear Thursday morning, uprooting beach houses
and leaving widespread floods as it set a rapid but steadily
weakening course up the Atlantic coast.
</P>
<P>
   The vast storm, whose advent alarmed much of the Eastern
seaboard and widely disrupted air, rail and highway travel, was
clearly losing its power with the dawn Thursday as the hurricane's
eye danced across the coastline following a two-week buildup of the
forces of nature and the precautions of government.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday evening, as Floyd reached northeastward along the
New Jersey coast to New York City, its strength had further waned.
It was downgraded to a tropical storm that still delivered lashing
rain but that officials said presented no major threat to New York
or other population centers.
</P>
<P>
   In the howling predawn of this coastal city, Floyd's power was
measured to be dropping from a Category 4 to a Category 2 hurricane
before dropping further to a tropical storm. While storm-drenched
hurricane veterans were delighted after all the ominous evacuation
warnings that it delivered far less physical injury and property
destruction than originally feared, Floyd nevertheless proved
relentlessly drenching, dropping as much as 19 inches of rain in
some areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were blessed this time,'' Fire Chief Keith Studt said as he
roamed flooded streets and hacked away at fallen trees cluttering
the streets of nearby Winter Park. ``We were lucky this thing
suddenly ratcheted down before it hit town.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the flooding and house damage out on Oak Island and
other coastal barrier islands was considerable as the storm headed
unpredictably northward, causing further disruption across a wide
swath of the seaboard. Residents emerged uncertainly here from
emergency centers to blink at piles of suddenly sun-dappled debris.
By then Floyd was speeding up along the coast by Virginia,
Chesapeake Bay and the New Jersey shore.
</P>
<P>
   It lost further power but still spewed fresh damage along its
western flank as the storm was described as fading into a rough
course aimed toward eastern Long Island. But travel turmoil was
widespread during the day and quickly became bumper to bumper
around Washington, as a truck overturned on the storm-lashed
Chesapeake Bay Bridge and blocked one of the major regional
arteries.
</P>
<P>
   At least five fatalities across Floyd's path were listed
tentatively as storm-related, but local residents here waited
through a long night in fear of even worse things.
</P>
<P>
   The storm's eye loomed out of the Atlantic's 30-foot seas as a
somewhat tentative invader, avoiding a deep inland attack and
cutting across Cape Fear at 3:20 a.m. to begin a rapid ride up the
coastline. Open relief at the turning was the reaction from this
storm-hardened city, which has had to batten down for five
hurricanes in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was merciful that it didn't come through at the 155 mph
they were first talking about,'' said James Blanton, hitching his
pickup truck's chain to a tree fallen across the road to his
granddaughter's house. ``That's what saved us, even with all this
flooding.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, the storm registered sustained winds of 98 mph that
gusted up to 130, tearing up the roof of the Brunswick County
Hospital to the south. There was some roof damage as well to
Wilmington's historic Cotton Exchange building, which is now a
shopping mall centerpiece.
</P>
<P>
   One unnerving accident was the draining of 2 million gallons
from a hog waste lagoon into the Northeast Cape Fear River, about
40 miles to the north.
</P>
<P>
   But otherwise the storm caused minimal structural damage here,
as in South Carolina.

 By NEIL HOHLFELD  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The upsizing of America is a fact of the 1990s. We like to wash
down double cheeseburgers and super-size french fries with a
64-ounce soda while driving a sport utility vehicle.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Size matters.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly does on the football field, where offensive linemen
continue to grow bigger, heavier and stronger. Thirty years ago,
the 1969 Texas Longhorns team that won the national championship
had an offensive line that averaged 213 pounds. This year, the
Texas line averages 317 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two-thirteen?'' said Texas A&AMP;M guard Chris Valletta, a
relative lightweight at 295 pounds. ``That's what defensive backs
weigh now. Amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   At big-time college programs, 300 pounds has become the norm for
offensive linemen. In the Big 12 Conference, only Kansas State does
not have at least one lineman who weighs 300 or more. At Colorado
and Texas, all five starting linemen come in at more than three
bills.
</P>
<P>
   When Colorado opened the season against Colorado State, the
offensive lines on both teams were heavier than the line for the
Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos. (Colorado averaged 311,
Colorado State 300 and Denver 287.) Granted, the Broncos' line is
one of the smallest in the NFL, but the size of collegiate linemen
is increasing with no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Intense weight training, supplements such as creatine that add
bulk, and a larger average size in general are the main reasons for
the explosion of size in linemen. (The NCAA does not allow the use
of anabolic steroids or androstenedione, the substance used last
season by St. Louis Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire. According to
NCAA literature, the organization conducts drug tests before bowls
and administers spot drug testing year-round.)
</P>
<P>
   Using the Longhorns as an example, the growth has been
eye-popping. From 213 pounds in 1969, the average weight of linemen
jumped to 248 in 1979 to 274 in 1989 to this year's 317.
</P>
<P>
   How large can you go? Texas left tackle Leonard Davis is 6-6,
360 pounds, and he sees bigger, stronger, younger players coming
along behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys like (6-6, 339-pound sophomore) Mike Williams and (6-6,
335-pound freshman) Derrick Dockery, those are big guys,'' Davis
said. ``I always thought I would be the biggest guy here, but I'm
not so sure now. I'm a little leery of the big new guys coming in
every year. I have to stay on top of my game and work hard to keep
a spot. You can't earn a spot on size.''
</P>
<P>
   But as 6-5, 315-pound Texas guard Roger Roesler says, the bigger
the better _ as long as the bulk doesn't get in the way of a
player's quickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get a 300-pounder, but you have to make sure you get
speed and agility with it,'' Roesler said. ``Coaches look for
somebody who has speed and agility, so they'll take a 280-pounder
if he is better than a 300-pounder. But if they have the same speed
and agility, then without a doubt I would favor the heavier guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I would lean toward the heavier guys because I'm
right up there with them.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are cases where a player is too big _ even to play the
offensive line. Texas Tech left tackle Jonathan Gray, considered
one of the top players at his position in the nation, once weighed
nearly 400 pounds during his redshirt 1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   Gray has lost weight each year and is down to 357 in his junior
season. He is still called ``The House,'' the nickname hung on him
when he was flirting with 400 pounds, but he's no longer an
apartment complex, merely a nice, four-bedroom split-level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just a practice dummy then,'' Gray said of his redshirt
season. ``That was when I was able to assess myself and realize I
needed to change a lot of the things I was doing to be able to move
to the next level. I had to make some alterations in my physique.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the smaller guys that have the speed to work against me,
I knew I needed to get a little bit faster to be able to pass-block
against them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray's role model is St. Louis Rams tackle Orlando Pace, who was
one of the first megasized college linemen while at Ohio State in
the mid-1990s. What set Pace apart was the speed he possessed
despite weighing more than 325 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He paved the way for really big offensive linemen,'' Gray
said. ``But you have to be fast and big like he is, not just big
like he is. I don't see bigger automatically being better. It
really doesn't pay to be big and not be able to play.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the biggest difference in the last decade. Nearly every
one of the 300-pound-plus linemen has the quickness and agility to
handle the defensive player across from him. In the past, huge
linemen merely leaned on their opponent, making them strong run
blockers put suspect pass blockers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be you'd get a 260-pound guy and people would say
he's kind of on the light side but he's super-fast,'' Valletta
said. ``Now it's like, well, he's 315 pounds but he's super-fast.
It's just getting bigger and quicker, so you have to do the same
thing in order to survive. As long as you can stay quick and get
your pads under theirs, the more size you have, the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have size, but you have to be able to move and be
athletic and get under people. Leverage is the key. If you're lower
than the other guy, you're going to win; it doesn't matter if
you're 260 or 360. And that's what you're seeing, guys who are
300-plus who can really move and really play.''
</P>
<P>
   Valletta, a junior from Plano, gained 10 pounds during the
summer, taking him from 285 to 295. He spent two hours a day, five
days a week, in the weight room, pushing hard when it might have
been easier to bulk up by having a couple of extra helpings of
mashed potatoes or another chocolate malt. It doesn't work that
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you're so tired, you don't want to finish,''
Valletta said. ``What makes you want to finish is that you know the
guys at Texas are doing the same thing, and they're going to
finish. So we might as well finish and finish harder. That's the
attitude you have to have. That's what gets you through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at 295, Valletta is one of the smaller offensive linemen at
A&AMP;M. The Aggies have Andy Vincent (304) and Shea Holder (304) at
tackles, Valletta and Semisi Heimuli (309) at guards and center
Seth McKinney (293) on the offensive line, which averages 301
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Valletta wonders what linemen will look like in the future. Will
400 pounds be the norm 30 years from now? That might seem
incomprehensible, but certainly no one in 1969 thought so many
300-pound linemen would be stomping around football fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like 300 pounds does seem to be the norm now,''
Valletta said. ``It makes you think what they're going to look like
20 years from now. It's crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think there has to be a limit. There has to be a
point down the road where guys just get too big to be agile. But
that's what everyone thought before. I've seen guys who are 6-3 and
weigh 340, 350 and can really move. I'm 6-3, and I don't think I'd
be able to walk across the street if I was 340.''
</P>
<P>
   The upside to the upsizing of lines is by the fourth quarter,
defenses are worn down. Davis and Texas Tech's Curtis Lowery, a
6-5, 327-pound guard, say they've noticed opponents shrinking away
as the game progresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to describe,'' Davis said. ``You've worked hard to
get to this point, then you have this guy who is literally ready to
walk off the field. You feel good about yourself. That's the goal _
to make a guy not want any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Lowery: ``In the fourth quarter, when we've been pushing on
them the whole game, they just can't fight against how big we are.
They try and try, but eventually we're going to wear them down.''
</P>
<P>
   The dream of every starting lineman who has worked to bulk up to
the 300-pound-plus range is to advance to the NFL. Davis, a junior
from Wortham, says he believes he is at his ideal weight and
doesn't anticipate having to get any bigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be none of that 380 or 390 stuff,'' Davis said.
``My back would start hurting. I can only carry so much.''

REPORT KNOCKS HOLE IN PROPOSED TRIANA PROJECT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore's plan to have NASA provide
continuous, satellite-generated images of the Earth for posting on
the Internet is not worth its $220 million cost, the space agency's
internal auditor says.
</P>
<P>
   In a new report, inspector general Roberta Gross said it would
be ill-advised for the financially strapped agency to fund a new
system to collect pictures of Earth when many images already are
available. In addition, Gross said Gore's proposed Triana project
would cost more than four times the vice president's $50 million
estimate.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, speaking through his spokesman Chris Lehane, defended
his proposed round-the-clock Earth pictures Thursday as a ``good
idea and good science.''
</P>
<P>
   The planetary views would increase scientific understanding of
environmental changes affecting the ozone layer and wind patterns,
Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Triana project would help us get important information
regarding weather patterns,'' he added, citing the havoc Tropical
Storm Floyd was wreaking Thursday on the East Coast. ``Weather
patterns have a dramatic impact on our nation's safety and
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA has spent nearly $41 million on the controversial project,
which has not received congressional endorsement. Republican
lawmakers in the House have voiced objections to Gore's initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Gross, in a letter to NASA Administrator Dan Goldin last week,
was critical of the agency's plan to spend much of its scarce
federal funds on the project.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has yet to set NASA's budget for next year, but Texas
lawmakers on Capitol Hill expect the final figure to be about $13.6
billion, roughly the same as this year's budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the context of NASA's constrained budget and the widespread
availability of satellite pictures of the Earth, we are concerned
about the cost and changing goals of the Triana mission,'' Gross
wrote on behalf of the inspector general's office. ``We are
concerned that Triana's added science may not represent the best
expenditures of NASA's limited funding.''
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, Triana critic Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr.,
R-Wis. and chairman of the House panel that oversees NASA, seized
on Gross' comments to reiterate his call for Gore to abandon the
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope NASA will take the IG's reassessment recommendation to
heart and let science _ not politics _ decide how to spend NASA's
scarce budget dollars,'' said Sensenbrenner. ``By terminating the
Triana mission sooner, rather than later, we will free up well over
$100 million for higher NASA priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   As envisioned by Gore, the satellite would be stationed halfway
to the sun and beam high-resolution images of Earth to anyone with
access to the Internet. The project is named for Rodrigo de Triana,
the sailor who first spotted North America on Christopher Columbus'
voyage in 1492.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite is scheduled for launch aboard a space shuttle in
December 2000. By next month, NASA will have spent $41 million
developing the satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Gross, in her Sept. 10 inspector-general report, criticized the
space agency for pressing forward with the Triana project without
fully assessing the scientific value of photographing the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASA has described the Triana mission as the product of a
rigorous peer-review process,'' Gross wrote. ``(But) neither
internal nor external advisory groups reviewed whether a spacecraft
beaming back pictures of the Earth on the Internet was the most
effective way to educate and inspire the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Gross added that NASA could keep down costs and still provide
live pictures of Earth by conducting a ``virtual Triana'' a project
that would rely on U.S. spacecraft already transmitting images of
the planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtual Triana is the least costly option, and the one most
likely to meet the program's educational and inspiration goals
faster, better and cheaper, but it would gather no new scientific
data,'' the inspector general wrote.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's Ghassem Asrar, associate administrator for Earth science,
assailed Gross' report for mischaracterizing the extent of
scientific discussion and work that went into the agency's
consideration into launching Triana.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report's recommendation would have us revisit the
fundamental design of a project that is far along in its
development and is meeting the objectives set for it within the
cost and schedule constraints,'' Asrar said.
</P>
<P>
   Gross voiced her concerns about the Triana project as Senate and
House members prepare to debate how much money NASA should receive
next year.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate Appropriations subcommittee this month voted to fund
the space agency at $13.6 billion next year, about $900 million
more than the House has approved for the agency. Texas Sen. Kay
Bailey Hutchison, a Republican, and House Majority Whip Tom DeLay,
R-Texas, said they expect the higher Senate figure to clear
Congress and be signed into law by President Clinton within the
next few weeks.

 &HT;    Respect for ocean means strong houses, less damage in Bahamas
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOPE TOWN, Bahamas _ Sixty-year-old Peggy Gates has lived on
rocky Elbow Key all her life and has never seen a storm with the
awesome power of Hurricane Floyd. With reported winds off 155 mph
and waves surging to 20 feet, Floyd chewed away towering sand
dunes, toppled some houses and even cut this narrow island clean in
half for a short time.
</P>
<P>
   But as badly as Floyd roughed up Hope Town, Cherokee, Sandy
Point, Marsh Harbour and the other towns of Great Abaco, the
destruction in most places didn't appear catastrophic, at least
compared to the utter devastation that Hurricane Andrew _ a
smaller, less-powerful storm _ left in South Florida in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   While there was serious destruction on Abaco and there will be
weeks of misery with no power or telephones, residents think they
know why so many homes survived largely intact. Born and raised
with the ocean as an ever-present neighbor, they have a healthy
respect for its power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We build our houses strong and we build them where they should
be,'' said Gates, whose home survived Floyd's fury with hardly a
scratch.
</P>
<P>
   As proof, she pointed to a stretch of beach where foreign
residents recently built vacation homes atop a sand dune. Floyd
leveled seven of the homes, swatting them into heaps of splintered
lumber now floating in the nearby bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tourists want to be on the water, and that's fine when the
weather is good,'' she said, shaking her head at the piles of
debris. ``But there is nothing like the power of the ocean. Some of
the locals' houses overlook the ocean, but they build on rock, not
on a sand dune.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say the destruction left by Floyd isn't serious.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of homes and businesses have ripped-up roofs, and
hundreds more are missing shingles, but there are still roofs in
place on most buildings. There are twisted signs and torn awnings,
snapped trees and power lines dangling from some poles, but within
24 hours after Floyd had passed, residents had cleared most
streets, traffic was moving and life was slowly headed back to a
semblance of normal.
</P>
<P>
   After Andrew, large swaths of south Dade County looked as if
they had been bombed. Visitors driving across elevated freeway
bridges saw a vast panorama of destruction, with thousands of homes
completely roofless or with caved-in walls, and thousands more
roofs stripped bare of every single shingle.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew, of course, devastated a much more densely-populated
area. It took south Dade weeks to clear the roads of downed trees,
and months to restore basic services such as power and telephones.
</P>
<P>
   And Abaco will take months to recover completely.
</P>
<P>
   But while the island's sparse population means fewer homes and
buildings are in harm's way, it is clear even to a casual eye that
most of the buildings in the Bahamas fared far better in Floyd's
winds than many south Dade structures fared during Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   There was an outcry after Andrew about shoddy building practices
and inspections, and the county adopted what is considered one of
the toughest building codes in the country. The standard is to make
most buildings withstand hurricanes with winds up to 125 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Gate's son, Bill, who has built houses in Florida and on Elbow
Key, feels builders here face a much tougher _ if unofficial _ code
than in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody here knows everybody and they know which carpenter
built which house,'' he said. ``A code to 125 mph is nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, Gates was familiar with crews that might build homes
in six weeks or less, throwing up one after another in sprawling
suburban developments where the emphasis is on speed and sales.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bahamas, he takes six months to build a house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't use press-board or nail guns,'' he said, referring to
labor-saving devices and materials popular with American
construction crews. ``Every individual stud is strapped at the top
and bottom and every rafter is bolted through the double top plate
with a half-inch bolt. You do that and you know that house will be
standing after the hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   Marty Cash, another Hope Town resident who manages dozens of
rental vacation homes, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always got in mind what we're building for, and that's
hurricanes,'' he said. ``All our hardware is stainless steel, all
our concrete is hand-mixed. Here, reputation is everything. We
don't have inspectors, but the community is so small that you can't
get away with cutting any corners.''
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Gates says Bahamians simply don't know any other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can have an ordinary hurricane here and it hardly does any
damage, but when it hits the States, everything is flattened,'' she
said. ``People here respect the ocean.''

DAIMLERCHRYSLER AND UAW REACH TENTATIVE PACT 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ Paving the way for contracts covering the
nation's 400,000 unionized auto workers, the United Automobile
Workers union and DaimlerChrysler AG on Thursday morning reached
tentative agreement on a four-year pact calling for a $1,350
signing bonus and pay increases of 3 percent a year on top of
adjustments for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   If workers ratify the deal later this month, as expected, they
will also get heftier pension benefits and additional job security,
even as the company is allowed to continue downsizing through
attrition, according to local union officials. Under the current
contract, auto workers have earned between $50,000 and $100,000 a
year, depending on the amount of overtime they work and the level
of corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   The four-year agreement is unusual because no auto labor
contracts have lasted longer than three years since the 1950s. This
contract would provide raises of 3 percent for the first three
years, plus a lump-sum payment in the fourth year of 3 percent of
annual wages, according to union and company officials.
</P>
<P>
   The raises come in addition to the inflation adjustments that
have been a mainstay of the union's contracts with automakers since
1948. In the current contract, that adjustment amounted to 90
percent of increases in the Consumer Price Index. So far this year,
inflation is running at a 2.6 percent annual rate, which would
trigger a 2.3 percent increase for auto workers. Workers would also
get a share of corporate profits, as they have in past years.
</P>
<P>
   The new agreement includes language prohibiting spinoffs of auto
companies' parts units, local union officials said, and that could
cause headaches for Ford Motor Co., which plans to sell its Visteon
auto parts unit, a move that would affect 23,500 union members.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   UAW national officials and company executives refused to
disclose the details of the deal Thursday, saying they wanted to
first inform workers nationwide. Bargainers reached the deal after
48 hours of round-the-clock talks. ``We have a lead company
agreement,'' UAW spokesman Frank Joyce announced about 8 a.m.
DaimlerChrysler spokesman David Barnas declined to discuss the
terms of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Because the union typically reaches a deal with one of the Big
Three automakers, then insists the others accept similar terms, the
DaimlerChrysler pact is expected to lay out a pattern for General
Motors Corp. and Ford Motor to follow in their contracts, which are
being negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies early on realized that with car sales at record
levels and profits at record levels, they couldn't plead poverty,''
said David Healy, an analyst at Burnham Securities. ``It is a
generous contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Some local labor officials agreed. ``We're pretty certain that
it will be a pretty good deal for us,'' said Roger Brown, president
of Local 550 in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a great package,'' said H. Scott Stanton, vice president
of a Local 624 in Syracuse, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The language in the DaimlerChrysler contract covering spinoffs
is a big concern for Ford, which is in the process of selling off
Visteon, just as GM spun off its Delphi auto parts division to
investors earlier this year. Relations between Ford and the union,
which for a decade have been the best in the industry, soured this
year because of the company's plans to sell Visteon. That is one
reason why Ford is expected to be the last company to reach a deal
on a new contract.
</P>
<P>
   Ford executives said they did not know whether the agreement
reached with DaimlerChrysler would make it more difficult for the
company to divest the auto parts business. ``We need to see the
contract language before we can draw any conclusions,'' said Ed
Miller, a Ford spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's deal may result in similar pay raises for the
nation's nonunion auto workers. Toyota Motor, Honda Motor, Nissan
Motor and Mitsubishi Motors have in the past matched the Big
Three's hourly pay rates.
</P>
<P>
   And because of the auto industry's sheer size, the deal also has
significance for many American workers, said labor experts, who
noted the strength of the wage gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sends a strong message that if the economy is so good,
workers should be sharing it a bit more,'' said Harley Shaiken, a
labor professor at the University of California at Berkeley. ``The
high wages and the job security provisions promise a more motivated
work force and a better relation with the union.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaiken, industry analysts and economists cautioned that their
comments were based on an incomplete knowledge of the contract's
contents.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists said that the pay raises and heftier pension
benefits might signal a trade with the union. The UAW has been
pressing the companies to replace retiring workers, but this
contract allows faster downsizing by allowing the company to
replace just one worker for every two who retire, according to
local union officials. The current contracts require the companies
to preserve 95 percent of existing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half the UAW workers at the Big Three auto companies are
eligible to retire within the next five years, the union says.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the nation's auto workers, it is a windfall,'' said Diane
Swonk, chief economist at Bank One Corp. in Chicago. ``This is like
the big buyouts that we've seen in the Fortune 500 for the past 20
years for white-collar workers.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The contract will allow the companies to build more cars with
fewer workers, she said. ``The UAW got lucky that the automakers
are doing well enough to offer an olive branch of wage increases,
but I'd be surprised if they stop the downsizing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street is counting on continued downsizing. ``The Street is
right now presuming that GM will continue to ride the attrition
wave,'' said Stephen Girsky, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter. The matter is most important for GM because it has been
cutting its labor force while DaimlerChrysler's American factories
have been hiring, and Ford's employment levels have been slowly
falling since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Girsky called the deal ``one of the richest contracts ever.'' He
calculated that at 3 percent, three years of wage increases would
cost G.M. another $2.26 billion in those years, or between $1.10
and $1.15 a share, assuming volume and productivity stayed the
same. The lump-sum payment would cost GM approximately $375
million. Costs would be lower for Ford and DaimlerChrysler, perhaps
30 to 35 cents a share, Girsky estimated, because they have fewer
workers. These numbers do not include adjustments for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 contract, which was extended Tuesday, featured a $2,000
lump-sum payment in the first year and 3 percent raises in the next
two years in addition to cost-of-living adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   One sticking point in negotiations with DaimlerChrysler was a
dispute over union organizing drives at a Mercedes sport utility
factory in Vance, Ala., and at four factories building Freightliner
trucks and components in North Carolina, South Carolina and
Ontario, Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The five nonunion factories were owned by Daimler before it
bought Chrysler. The union received some reassurances that the
company would stay neutral in the bargaining process, but details
were unavailable Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Around 8 a.m., a weary-looking UAW president Stephen Yokich
gathered with his negotiators in DaimlerChrysler's parking lot in
Auburn Hills and called them ``a great team.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether they had popped champagne corks to celebrate
reaching an agreement, Yokich shook his head. ``Champagne? No. Some
of us drank beer, some drank tea and some drank Diet Coke,'' Yokich
said, as an empty Miller beer can clattered to the concrete of the
parking lot, having been dropped by one of his colleagues. One by
one, members of his bargaining team gave him bear hugs and clapped
him on the back, then got in their cars and drove away.
</P>
<P>
   Yokich refused to characterize the talks, which seemed at
several points over the last 20 hours to be nearly concluded. But
he pooh-poohed the idea that the agreement had been close to final
several times, but had been derailed by last-minute sticking
points. ``Close only counts in horseshoes, hand grenades and bocci
balls,'' Yokich said.

TEEN WARNED OTHERS AS GUNMAN BEGAN HIS RAMPAGE
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ If instinct told Mary Beth Talley to run
away from a man mumbling and firing his way through a church foyer
Wednesday night, she didn't heed it.
</P>
<P>
   Talley, 17, dropped the programs she was handing out and ran
into the sanctuary of Wedgwood Baptist Church, yelling over the
sounds of a Christian rock band, ``There's a man shooting
outside!''
</P>
<P>
   She ran to the mother of a lifelong friend. The woman was
struggling to force her disabled daughter out of the pew and onto
the floor. Shielding part of Heather MacDonald with her body as
gunman Larry Gene Ashbrook walked back and forth shooting, Talley
knew she provided an easy target.
</P>
<P>
   ``My full body was in view of him. I heard a shot, and then I
felt it,'' she said Thursday from a recliner in her far southwest
Fort Worth home. ``I thought, was I just shot? I felt a sting. I
thought it would hurt a lot, but it really didn't. I guess I was
numb. I was just thinking, `Don't freak out' or Heather would start
freaking out and he would notice her, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The last shot rang out and people started yelling: ``He's dead.
He's dead,'' she said. Talley half-ran, half-staggered outside to
the church lawn and laid down. She tried to use programs to stanch
the blood soaking one of her favorite shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking, `God, please don't let me die. I'm ready if
you want to take me, but I'm not ready,' '' she recalled. ``I
haven't seen my mom all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura MacDonald described Talley as a ``precious girl. But I
thought that before that night'' when Talley held on to MacDonald's
daughter even after Talley was shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had her hand on one side of her neck and I had the other
side, and we were trying to keep Heather down,'' MacDonald said.
``She had her body up over my daughter's shoulder. We felt so
exposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Talley, who has taken her daughter to Wedgwood Baptist
Church since she was a toddler, tried all day Thursday to get her
daughter to rest, to calm down and eat something. But her
daughter's actions Wednesday night hardly came as a surprise, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I raised her not to just think about herself, but to think
about other people first,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Beth Talley, an honor student at Southwest High School,
knew by the time she got to the hospital that she would be all
right. The paramedics and doctors were being so rough with her, she
figured that it must be a good sign, she said. By 3 a.m., she was
headed home.
</P>
<P>
   The bullet penetrated her right shoulder, creating a
quarter-size hole, and traveled into her lower back, where it
remains embedded in muscle and tissue. Doctors will remove the
bullet in a few weeks, she said.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday afternoon, Talley seemed more concerned about papers
and schoolwork, her flute practice with the marching band and all
the other pursuits of a teen-age girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't luck,'' she said. ``It was an act of God.''

CASH-BALANCE PENSION PLANS UNDER SCRUTINY BY IRS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Facing mounting pressure from Congress, the Internal Revenue
Service has effectively put off approval of so-called cash-balance
pension plans, which critics say discriminate against older workers
while saving many employers millions of dollars every year.
</P>
<P>
   The about-face by the agency comes as its chief counsel prepares
to testify before a Senate committee on Tuesday, and some lawmakers
seek to rein in what they now call an abusive practice that can
reduce middle-age employees' pensions by as much as a third to a
half.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of companies have already converted from traditional
pension plans to cash-balance pensions. Unlike old-fashioned plans,
in which employees earn most of their retirement benefits toward
the end of their careers, under cash-balance plans, employers set
aside the same percentage of an employee's pay every year. As a
result, pensions of younger workers grow faster, but older workers
can, and in some cases do, lose hundreds of thousands of dollars in
retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Conversions at some companies have prompted protests from both
blue-collar and white-collar employees, most notably those at IBM,
where a number of workers have sought to unionize over the issue.
The chairwoman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Ida
L. Castro, has also said that her agency is investigating whether
the plans unlawfully discriminate against older workers.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo on Wednesday, Carol Gold, the IRS director of employee
plans, told regional IRS officials that ``a number of important
issues may be raised'' when a company converts to a cash-balance
plan, and she ordered them to obtain technical advice from
officials in Washington before taking action on conversions.
Previously, regional IRS offices had the authority to approve
conversions without a go-ahead from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The memo does not affect any pension plans that have already
obtained approval to convert to cash-balance plans. But critics of
cash-balance plans said the memo from Ms. Gold was certain to halt,
at least for some time, approvals of new plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, this is a freeze,'' said William
Carr, a Denver lawyer who represents employees in litigation
involving cash-balance plans.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Karen Ferguson, director of the Pension Rights Center in
Washington, said: ``This suggests that, finally, the IRS is taking
a hard look at this.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to characterize the effect of the memo, Don Roberts, an
IRS spokesman, declined, saying the document spoke for itself.
Roberts said he did not know how many companies had already
received or were awaiting approval. Since the IRS has so far not
raised major objections to cash-balance conversions, a number of
employers have converted their pensions without first receiving
approval.
</P>
<P>
   But companies that fail to eventually obtain approval are at
risk of having their plans' tax-exempt status stripped. In fact, in
a case involving Onan Corp., a division of Cummins Engine Co., the
IRS took the position in a lawsuit last month that Onan's plan
should be stripped of its tax-exempt status because of the way it
converted to a cash-balance plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly hope any slowdown or any stalling is not the
result of any political pressure'' applied to the IRS, said James
Delaplane, vice president for retirement policy at the Association
of Private Pension and Welfare Plans, which represents large
employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would certainly not be reasonable for the service to shift
course from their existing guidance'' that cash-balance plans are
``appropriate and legal,'' Delaplane said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Charles O. Rossotti, the commissioner of the IRS, said in an
interview on Wednesday that the service was reviewing its policy to
determine whether conversions to cash-balance plans may unlawfully
discriminate against some workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very complex issue, and very fact-specific to each
plan and how the conversion is done. Some conversions may be very,
very reasonable, and others may not be,'' Rossotti said.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to comment on what direction IRS policy might take.
``We are working on it. It has to be worked through,'' he said,
referring other questions to Stuart Brown, the IRS chief counsel,
who is expected to testify on Tuesday before the Senate Committee
on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. Brown declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bernard Sanders, I-Vt., a critic of cash-balance plans,
said the IRS action might ``provide breathing space for the IRS,
giving them the opportunity to thoroughly review whether these
plans violate federal age-discrimination laws.''

DOW REBOUNDS FROM EARLY SLIDE BUT STILL CLOSES 63.96 LOWER 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices pulled out of an early sinking spell
Thursday to close with modest losses for two of the major gauges,
while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index eked out a slender
gain.
</P>
<P>
   Among the forces buffeting the market were warnings of corporate
profit shortfalls, a rebound by the dollar from a 44-month low
against the yen, a stronger-than-expected report on industrial
output in August, a rise in a barometer of Philadelphia-area
manufacturing and the approach of Friday's triple-witching session
when options and futures contracts expire.
</P>
<P>
   Many traders heeded official advice to leave early to beat the
full effects of Hurricane Floyd, in some cases covering short
positions _ that is, buying securities to repay borrowed securities
they have already sold _ and that helped fuel the comeback that
began about mid-day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that traders closed out positions they'd normally
close out tomorrow,'' said Warren Epstein, head trader at Richard
A. Rosenblatt &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Stock Exchange kept normal hours and said it would
do so again Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which at one stage was down
nearly 175 points, finished with a loss of 63.96 points, or 0.6
percent. At 10,737.46, the Dow is 5.2 percent off its Aug. 25 peak
but is still 17 percent higher for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The NASDAQ market fell 7.45 points, or a quarter of 1 percent,
to close at 2,806.72. The S&AMP;P 500 edged up 0.51 of a point, to
1,318.48.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates eased, apparently reflecting diminished concern
about the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard fell 4 9/16 to 103 15/16 to account for more
than a third of the decline in the blue-chip Dow, where 21 stocks
fell and only eight gained.
</P>
<P>
   The session's most active issue was Quintiles Transnational, a
North Carolina company that is the biggest conductor of clinical
trials for drug makers. Quintiles skidded 14} a share, to 20, after
it said profits would be shy of expectations this year and next.
More than 39.5 million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   FDX, parent of Federal Express, and Eastman Chemical also warned
of lower profits; FDX fell 5 7/16 a share, to 38\, while Eastman
lost 2], to 43 15/16. Xerox, which shuffled its sales force again,
slumped 4 5/16, to 42}.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products gained 3{, to 46}, on word that it may be
near settling injury claims by users of its diet drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the NASDAQ set a closing high in September, the Dow
industrials in August and the S&AMP;P 500 in July, the general market
has lagged well behind. According to an analysis by Alfred Goldman
of A.G. Edwards, 51 percent of S&AMP;P companies closed Tuesday 20
percent or more below their 52-week highs prior to mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   Leah Modigliani, an equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, called
the market ``overvalued,'' but said it still offered values in
basic materials, energy and some cyclical stocks. ``We think a
global recovery is under way,'' she said, predicting that the
Federal Reserve would avoid raising short-term interest rates at
its Oct. 5 policy meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones 2,063 to 916 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 220 making new lows and only 18 new
highs.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks fell overseas, the biggest losses being 2.7 percent in
Tokyo, 1.5 percent in Germany and 1.5 percent in Sao Paulo.

CLINTON, RENO PUSH EFFORTS TO REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE IN WAKE OF TEXAS
TRAGEDY  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ANDREW BROMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Spurred by the shooting deaths of seven people in a
Texas church, President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno
urged the country Thursday to redouble efforts to reduce
gun-related violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we have to act as if it were our own children being
targeted by gun violence,'' Clinton said at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that there is nothing we can do to assure that this
will never happen,'' the president said. ``But there is a lot we
can do to assure that it will happen more rarely. And I can only
hope that the shock of this event will spur that kind of action.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the Fort Worth tragedy served as yet another wake-up
call to America to better understand why such violent acts occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to require the commitment of all Americans to look
at the issue of how we handle guns, of how we deal with mental
illness, of how we deal with hate,'' Reno said during her weekly
press briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to several recent high profile shootings, she said,
``...these events cry out for America to come together and to
address them in an effective, permanent manner.''
</P>
<P>
   A gunman identified as Larry Gene Ashbrook opened fire at the
Fort Worth church during a prayer rally Wednesday, then fatally
shot himself. He killed seven people and wounded seven.
</P>
<P>
   The attack, like the Columbine High School slayings in Colorado
or the shootings at the Jewish Community Center shootings in
California, is expected to renew calls to strengthen federal
gun-control laws.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Senate passed a bill that would impose
background checks on gun show sales, outlaw importation of
large-capacity ammunition clips and require the sale of safety
locks with firearms. But the House removed some restrictions
approved by the Senate and voted to roll back restrictions on gun
show sales. The bill is now in conference committee.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said Wednesday's
shooting should pressure the conference committee members to
reconcile their differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to act on protecting children; it's time to act on
passing sensible gun control, and the time to wait and to posture
is over,'' he said. ``I think that given enough time, the
leadership will send the conferees (word to), tell them to get to
work, and this legislation will pass.''
</P>
<P>
   House members from Texas sought to avoid tying the ongoing gun
control debate with the incident in Fort Worth, instead urging
Americans not to jump to conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Words cannot express my sense of shock and sadness at the
tragedy that took place at the Wedgwood Baptist Church. For a few
brief yet interminable moments, this house of worship became a
place of fear and terror,'' said Rep. Kay Granger, a Texas
Republican whose district includes the church. ``At this moment,
there are more questions than answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Frost, D-Dallas, called the shooting a ``tragedy for
our entire community.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This horrible act again makes clear that violent tragedies can
happen everywhere, even though we all hoped it wouldn't in our
community,'' said Frost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our children deserve, at a minimum, a sense of security in a
house of worship or when attending school,'' Frost said. ``We
should not let the act of a deranged man further chip away at our
children's dwindling sense of security.''
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said, ``Clearly the
man responsible for this tragedy hated life. He hated all that was
good. And so long as there are people who have no regard for the
sanctity of life, we will never be safe. Not even in God's house.''

TEEN IS LEFT PARALYZED AS HIS BIRTHDAY TURNS FROM JOY TO TERROR
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ First came the simple pleasures of being a
kid:
</P>
<P>
   The revelry of a 16th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Ownership, finally, of a driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   And the anticipation of suiting up for another high school
football game.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when the shooting erupted Wednesday night at Wedgwood
Baptist Church, the simple pleasures vanished: Justin Laird was
paralyzed from a bullet fired by a stranger.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, it has been a roller coaster of optimism and despair
for Justin: first, being told he was getting better, inspiring hope
that he might soon play football again; then, the sobering report
from a doctor that he may never
</P>
<P>
   walk again.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, friends and relatives said, Justin's will to
recover has been unwavering, giving strength to the people around
him.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours after the church massacre Wednesday night,
Justin's friends, relatives and teammates at Brewer High School
began to breath a sigh of relief.
</P>
<P>
   The 200-pound offensive lineman for the Brewer Bears would live,
doctors told them.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of the lucky ones at the church where Larry Gene
Ashbrook, 47, casually walked into a prayer meeting and concert
with a cigarette in his mouth and a gun in his hand. Ashbrook
fatally shot seven people and wounded Laird and six others before
killing himself.
</P>
<P>
   It was Justin's birthday _ a good day early on, when he got his
driver's license. ``He was very excited about that,'' a family
member said.
</P>
<P>
   The church had planned a surprise party for Justin after the
prayer meeting. Instead, Ashbrook walked in.
</P>
<P>
   Justin was sitting near his mother and father. They rushed to
his side when the gunfire began.
</P>
<P>
   ``His father discovered that he had been shot, and he was the
one who dragged him out of the building,'' said Jim Gatliff, the
family pastor.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, in the intensive care unit at John Peter Smith
Hospital in Fort Worth, Justin was not talking about the shooting.
His mind was on football.
</P>
<P>
   He dispatched a message to Coby Kirkpatrick, athletic trainer
for the Brewer Bears, saying he wanted his play book for the game
scheduled for last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told his grandpa that I had to tape him up so he could play
tonight,'' Kirkpatrick said. ``So I brought a roll of tape and left
it in his room,'' the trainer said as he waited with dozens of
others to give blood for those wounded at Wedgwood Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, Justin's doctor walked into his hospital
room. Once again, optimism and relief turned to gloom.
</P>
<P>
   The news was not good.
</P>
<P>
   Justin was told that the large-caliber bullet had damaged his
spinal cord and was still in his body, causing paralysis from the
chest down, said his grandfather, Don Laird. A neurosurgeon had
been summoned to determine the risks of trying to remove the
bullet.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, there will be no more football, and ``it would
take a miracle'' for Justin to walk again, Don Laird said the
doctor told them.
</P>
<P>
   If the prognosis frightened Justin, he did not show it, his
grandfather said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Don Laird said, the teen attempted to prop up his
shaken family. ``He's taking it really good. He took it better than
I would.''
</P>
<P>
   Gatliff added: ``He wasn't even angry or upset. He was humbled
by the support from his family and friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the hospital waiting room, Justin's friends, classmates
and teammates cried and hugged as they received word of the
paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   The grandfather went into a small office to make telephone
calls. He clutched in his hand a message from Dennis Franchione,
head football coach for Texas Christian University.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs want to join the Brewer Bears at the hospital to show
their support for Justin. It will mean a lot for the wounded boy,
Don Laird said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's lived and breathed football since he was 3 years old,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears' game was canceled last night. Several players said
that if Justin could not play, neither would they.
</P>
<P>
   Justin and his parents, John and Lori Laird, will rebound from
the tragedy, said an aunt, Judy Sloan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very devoted to family; they are always there for
each other,'' Sloan said.
</P>
<P>
   She said of John and Lori Laird: ``They both worship that kid.''

NBC COMPLETES ACQUISITION OF 32 PERCENT STAKE IN PAXSON

<TEXT>
<P>
   NBC completed its acquisition of a 32 percent stake in Paxson
Communications Corp. on Thursday, enabling NBC to achieve a
long-sought goal: a second national television channel for
entertainment programs.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, for $415 million in new Paxson convertible stock,
includes the right for NBC to acquire 49 percent in Paxson in
February 2002 for another $800 million should changes in federal
regulations make it possible for NBC to expand its ownership of
television stations.
</P>
<P>
   NBC president Robert Wright called the deal ``a very good
investment for us,'' adding that in what has become an intensely
crowded media environment, ``you need as much voice as you can
get.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that recent deals involving ``highly integrated
competitors'' _ the planned acquisition of CBS Corp. by Viacom Inc.
_ ``pushed us to put ourselves in a position to expand our
services.''
</P>
<P>
   If NBC, a unit of General Electric Co., were to convert its new
securities, its holdings would translate into $13.01 a common
share. Shares of Paxson fell $1.0625 Thursday, to $14; those of GE
rose $1.25, to $117.25.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Dixon, an analyst with Paine Webber, said that the
deal was positive for both companies because it gave Paxson the
revenue needed to finish buying stations and to cover program
costs. It also ``gives NBC very real flexibility as they go
forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Paxson Communications chairman W. Lowell Paxson said he had
negotiated with several potential investors but that ``NBC stood
out as the best partner.'' Paxson assembled a lineup of 72
television stations covering about 76 percent of the country for
his Pax TV network, which he built around what he called ``family
friendly'' programming, which consisted mostly of repeats of
programs like ``Touched By an Angel,'' ``Highway to Heaven'' and
``Bonanza.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright noted that NBC's affiliates, which have opposed many of
NBC's investments in cable, had reason to embrace this move because
it allows them to form partnerships with Paxson stations that could
result in programs like newscasts receiving additional coverage on
the Paxson stations, thus generating more revenue for the
affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   Wright also cited the additional opportunity NBC will have to
expand its channel capacity when broadcasters go to a digital
system that will make it possible to turn a single broadcast
channel into four or five.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasters have wrestled with the decision of whether to use
the digital spectrum to create a single high-definition channel or
multiple channels. NBC Cable president Thomas Rogers, one of the
architects of the Paxson investment, said this deal would enable
NBC to do both.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we acquire controlling interest in Paxson,'' he said, ``we
may be able to use one channel in a market for high definition and
the other for multiplex channel options.''
</P>
<P>
   As for what specific NBC programming may turn up on the Paxson
channels, Pax TV president and chief programmer Jeff Sagansky said
he would work closely with the two executives in charge of NBC
entertainment, Scott Sassa and Garth Ancier, to decide which NBC
programs receive additional exposure on the Paxson stations.  &QL;

BELGRADE A CITY IN NEED OF MILK, AND A LITTLE PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ At 6:30 a.m., the lines have already
formed outside two food stores in New Belgrade, a district that
houses hundreds of thousands of the Serbian capital's 1.5 million
people. Residents are lining up for milk, which in recent weeks has
been scarce.
</P>
<P>
   ``For two days now I have been standing in the lines for milk,''
said Jozefa Markovic, a pensioner, later in the day. ``And this is
the most basic foodstuff.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not only milk that is in short supply. Gasoline, whether
in state-run gas stations or on the black market, is also hard to
find and has doubled in price in the last two weeks. The currency,
the Yugoslav dinar, has slipped further in the past weeks, trading
on the black market at 13 to the German mark, from 12 just a week
ago, more than double the official rate.
</P>
<P>
   Branka Stojanovic, a mother of three, returned home from
Thursday's shopping expedition with no meat and only a carton of
chocolate milk. ``Prices are going up steadily,'' she said. Mrs.
Stojanovic, an artist who teaches high school, only last week
received her April pay packet. ``Two of my children are sick,'' she
said. ``All in all, the situation is terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   After decades of mismanagement by Communists and their
successors, after eight years of war and international sanctions
and then a springtime of NATO bombing, Serbia's economy is in a
perilous state. Now, as winter approaches, there are even more
signs of distress, as Serbs buy up what they can and batten down
the hatches.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities also seem to be organizing themselves to at
least try to meet basic needs and thus avert widespread public
discontent. The Serbian prime minister, Mirko Marjanovic, traveled
to Moscow last week and apparently sealed a deal for Russian gas
supplies for the winter. His trip followed a visit to Belgrade by
Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Avdeyev, the first
high-level contact between the two countries since the war over
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how Belgrade, already indebted to Moscow, will
manage to pay for the gas, or why the Russians continue to supply
it. Foreign currency reserves here are low, unofficially estimated
at less than $150 million. Opposition economists say the government
is printing money freely, which may have caused the fall in the
dinar, and talk darkly of a return of the hyperinflation of 1993,
when prices rose by the hour and notes nominally worth billions of
dinars barely paid for a loaf of bread.
</P>
<P>
   Pensioners, meanwhile, have been told they will receive coupons
for electricity for the next few months instead of cash. Like all
citizens, they have had a tax for reconstruction of the country
deducted from their monthly income. Throughout the summer,
pensioners held protests against Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, but most are preoccupied, like other Serbs, with their
own survival.
</P>
<P>
   With economic troubles looming, the country is holding its
breath. The whole of society seems to be suspended in a sort of
limbo, paralyzed by inertia, even fear.
</P>
<P>
   This has helped produce an uneasy undeclared truce on the
political scene. Opposition parties have taken a breather from
their summer demonstrations, apparently hoping to gather strength
ahead of a new round of rallies scheduled to start Sept. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's government, after floating ideas of a shuffle or
even early elections, has gone quiet, as if waiting to see what
strength the opposition can muster.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is brave enough or strong enough to make a change,''
said Bratislav Grubacic, editor of the independent news agency VIP.
He was talking not only about the opposition but also about some
members of Milosevic's own Socialist Party and its coalition
partner, his wife's United Yugoslav Left party, who are rumored to
be disaffected but too nervous to act.
</P>
<P>
   The divisions among the democratic opposition, and specifically
the rivalry between Vuk Draskovic, leader of the largest opposition
party, the Serbian Renewal Movement, and Zoran Djindjic, leader of
the Democratic Party, are solidifying.
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic will be at the forefront of a nationwide campaign of
protests to be organized this fall by the Alliance for Change
coalition. Draskovic will not attend the opening rally in Belgrade,
one of his advisers, Predrag Simic, said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Although that announcement may yet be reversed _ Draskovic
announced dramatically two days ahead of a big Belgrade rally in
August that he would not take part, only to take the stage when the
night came _ Simic argued that to try to remove Milosevic from
power through street protests is naive. Yet the Serbian Renewal
Movement appears to have no other strategy. They want elections,
and since they hold only a minority of the seats in Parliament,
they would have to resort to public pressure to secure any early
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Simic welcomed a European Union plan approved earlier this week
to provide oil to towns and cities in Serbia that are run by
democrats who won power in the 1996 municipal elections. The
Union's scheme, called Energy for Democracy, is a good example of
how to apply international pressure on Milosevic, Simic said. ``The
E.U. sent the right message,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Simic said that the divisions in the opposition would do no harm
as long as the movements maintain a common goal. A future coalition
is possible, he said. Analysts see trouble ahead, though.
``Draskovic is waiting to see Djindjic fail,'' Grubacic said, so he
can step in and take up the mantle of undisputed leader of the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the public will respond and turn out for more
demonstrations is not at all clear. Srecko Mihajlovic, an associate
of the Institute of Social Studies in Belgrade, has announced poll
results showing that most of the people living in Serbia want
change, Beta News agency reported this week. How far people will go
to bring about change is less sure.
</P>
<P>
   For many people, tired and worried about the winter, the last
thing they want is unrest. Many of them took to the streets every
night for three months in the winter of 1996-97 to persuade
Milosevic to install the democratic municipal governments that had
won the 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he relented, and the opposition _ while functioning
in some cities, notably many of those worst damaged by NATO's bombs
this spring _ disintegrated, not least because of the feud between
Draskovic and Djindjic.
</P>
<P>
   Few Belgraders, at least for now, seem interested in tramping
the streets again in such numbers, for such opposition leaders.
``This is only a story in the media,'' said Ms. Petrovic, a
freelance journalist. ``Ordinary people are not talking about it.
They are concerned first about their children, then their jobs and
then prices.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ The threat of terrorism spread to Russia's heartland
Thursday as a huge explosion tore apart an apartment complex in the
southern city of Volgodonsk, killing at least 18 people and leaving
more than 200 injured.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing, at 5:57 a.m., was the fifth in Russia in less than
three weeks and underscored how vulnerable Russia remains to
terrorist attacks, even with heightened security. Almost 280 people
have died in the mysterious series of explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's blast bore the hallmarks of the earlier detonations
that have frightened and bewildered the public. The target was an
apartment house for ordinary citizens. The bomb went off as they
were sleeping. And no one claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Russian police and intelligence officials are insisting that
they have evidence that confirms the involvement of Chechen
militants in the bombings, and have detained 27 suspects in their
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The blast went off just nine miles from a nuclear power plant.
Russian authorities said the plant was unfinished and had not been
supplied with nuclear fuel. But the episode has generated concern
that terrorists may turn to their attention to Russia's vast
nuclear infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Vladimir Putin signed a decree calling on law
enforcement and other government agencies to develop plans within
three days to protect industry, transportation, communications,
food processing centers and nuclear complexes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to grit our teeth,'' Putin told a meeting of Russia's
cabinet. ``I'm calling on you to be more disciplined and vigilant,
in deeds not words.''
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin said security forces would try to seal
off the breakaway republic of Chechnya. There should be ``no
transport links'' to Chechnya, Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
   For all the tough talk, the images on the television news
Thursday night seemed to underscore the nation's defenselessness.
The bomb in Volgodonsk was hidden inside a truck or in a manhole.
It left a 50-foot-wide crater. The facade of the apartment house
was peeled away and the ground littered with mutilated bodies.
</P>
<P>
   One woman featured in Thursday night's news broadcast regained
consciousness in the hospital only to find out that her husband was
dead and her children missing. The death toll is likely to rise as
rescuers pick through the debris. About 25 of those hospitalized
are in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
   The string of five explosions began Aug. 31 at the upscale
Manezh shopping center near the Kremlin. All have been in Moscow
except for a car bombing of a military housing complex in Dagestan
on Sept. 4 that killed 64 people. Islamic rebels based in Chechnya
have been fighting Russian troops in Dagestan, a neighboring
Russian republic in the Caucasus. Thursday's blast suggested that
terrorists were responding to the stepped-up security in the
capital by taking their campaign to less protected towns and
cities.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Volgodonsk, about 700 miles south of Moscow, was established in
1956 when workers came to the area to build a dam and hydroelectric
plant. A factory, formerly named after Soviet leader Leonid
Brezhnev, was built there to produce equipment for nuclear power
stations.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion also gave some credence to ominous reports that a
band of Islamic militants was planning a nationwide campaign of
violence. Vyacheslav Izmailov, who is a specialist on the Caucasus
for the newspaper Novaya Gazeta and is also a retired military
officer, said he had been tipped off by an informant that 10
attacks were planned in Moscow and that other bombings would take
place in St. Petersburg and in the Rostov area, where Volgodonsk is
located.
</P>
<P>
   Izmailov said the informant indicated the explosions were
organized by two leaders of the Islamic insurgency in Dagestan,
Shamil Basayev and Khattab. But he said the attacks are being
carried out by Slavic mercenaries, as well as Chechens, making it
difficult for the authorities to identify the terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Basayev and Khattab have denied any involvement. But Izmailov's
account has been widely accepted by many Russians, adding to the
climate of fear.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The bombing has unnerved residents of Rostov-on-Don, a large
city about 120 miles to the west, where a festival has been planned
for Saturday to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Moscow explosions, we canceled the evening festival
events,'' a Rostov resident named Tatyana, who declined to give her
last name, said in a telephone interview. ``After Volgodonsk, we
canceled the entire festival. People are really scared.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Tatyana, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and other
dignitaries from the capital were expected at the celebration, but
now only Patriarch Aleksy II of the Russian Orthodox Church is
planning to attend a religious service.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As rescuers combed through the rubble at Volgodonsk, police in
Moscow continued their efforts to safeguard the capital. A police
spokesman said that a new cache of explosives _ more than three
tons disguised as 76 sacks of sugar _ was found in a garage.
</P>
<P>
   The garage was rented by the same man who leased space in the
two apartment houses demolished in bombing attacks here. He used
the stolen passport of a dead man named Mukhit Laipanov.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Moscow police said they had uncovered another large
cache of explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Berezovsky, a tycoon and former executive secretary of the
Commonwealth of Independent States, an organization of former
Soviet republics, said he believed the blasts had been organized by
Chechen militants.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that Russia's leading politicians were to blame
because they failed to come up with a political plan for restoring
Chechnya or develop a military plan to contain the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrorist acts won't be halted,'' he said. ``It will go on for
a long time.''

 &HT;    Fastest not always first
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dale Jarrett and Mark Martin are 1-2 in the Winston
Cup points standings, but they are tied for last in pole positions.
</P>
<P>
   Neither one of the top two drivers in NASCAR's top circuit has
won a pole through 25 races this season. Neither Jarrett nor Martin
appears concerned about the lack of No. 1 starts.
</P>
<P>
   They say the race for pole positions is overrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main focus is taking cars to the racetrack that we know
are going to race good on Sunday,'' Jarrett said. ``A lot of times,
you give up something in qualifying (for the race).''
</P>
<P>
   ``You haven't seen a lot of pole-winners win races this year,''
he said. ``We're a little more in the racing mode rather than
(chasing after the) pole.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, pole-sitters have won only four races, with the
last being Jeff Gordon at Sears Point on June 27. Gordon leads the
Cup with seven poles and is tied with Jeff Burton for most
victories with five. However, Gordon registered only two of his
wins from the pole.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fastest car doesn't always win the race,'' Sterling Marlin
said. ``Once the race starts, the pole-winner isn't always the
fastest car, either. Winning a pole means for one lap and one
particular time of day you were the best thing out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward Burton said, ``A lot of teams put an extra emphasis on
qualifying. You can usually tell who does because they qualify
pretty good, but they fade away once the race starts.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, starting a race first has had a minimal effect
on finishing a race first. Seven pole-sitters took the checkered
flag last year; but in each of the three previous seasons, 1995-97,
only four drivers won from the pole.
</P>
<P>
   At New Hampshire International Speedway, site of Sunday's
Dura-Lube/Kmart 300, earning the pole position has proved to be
almost meaningless in the final results. In nine Cup races at the
track, the No. 1 starter has been the first to cross the finish
line only once _ Gordon last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing about winning the pole is it's the first
thing you compete for,'' Steve Grissom said. ``If they threw
birdseed on the ground and told you the guy who picked up the most
pieces was the winner, every one of us would be on our hands and
knees, elbowing the other guy out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, who has a 270-point advantage over Martin with nine
races left, has been close to winning the pole a couple of times.
He started in the No. 2 position at the California and Dover races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe for some sponsors, it's a big deal for your driver to
get into the Bud Shootout,'' the preseason exhibition race for
pole-winners only, Jarrett said. ``We're more thinking about races
and the Winston Cup championship. I think it depends on the team
and what they are looking for.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guys, of course, want to qualify well. But I don't know if
they have ever been mad that I didn't get a pole. We just always
want to start up as far as we can up front.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who has captured a pole every season for more than a
decade, expressed surprise when asked about his lack of No. 1
starts. He has started second or third in eight races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe that we haven't won a pole yet this year,''
Martin said. ``If we don't win one, it will be the first time since
1988, but the year is not over yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've qualified well in nearly every race this year and
probably have a better starting average than last year, despite not
having won any poles. It's not awkward, we're still trying to do
it, and we still have (nine) chances.''

 &HT;    Vols, Gators talking that talk
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ Steve Spurrier originally planned to keep
his Gators' trash talk to a minimum before Saturday's game between
No. 4 Florida and No. 2 Tennessee. After last year's loss in
Knoxville, the head Gator figured it might be best.
</P>
<P>
   But Tennessee didn't play last week and used its free time to
demonstrate that it can talk smack with the best of them. Their
confidence bolstered by a 14-game winning streak, two SEC
championships in a row and last season's national championship, the
Volunteers aren't bashful anymore.
</P>
<P>
   For example, this is Tennessee guard Cosey Coleman on Florida's
defense, which had to replace 10 starters: ``I don't think they'll
be as good as they were last year up front. Most of the guys that
are starting now were in the rotation last year, but they weren't
as good as the guys starting. So you're looking at the second
string.''
</P>
<P>
   And this from receiver Cedrick Wilson, who was asked about
playing at Florida's Swamp, where Tennessee has lost six
consecutive games and the Gators have won 29 in a row: ``Playing
Florida in the Swamp doesn't mean any more to me than playing
Kentucky in Lexington. It doesn't mean anything to me at all.''
</P>
<P>
   So Spurrier took the muzzle off. ``I just told (the Gators) to
try and temper what they said. I hope we don't say more than we can
back up,'' he said. ``I think both teams have learned over the
years that all of this doesn't amount to (anything). But I read in
the paper that we're favored to win by two points, so how are we
supposed to act?''
</P>
<P>
   It has become an all-time week for bulletin-board material at
both schools. And the comments illustrate better than anything how
the Florida-Tennessee rivalry quickly is closing on Alabama-Auburn
as the nastiest in college football.
</P>
<P>
   Given the green light, several Gators were more than willing to
sling trash back. The consensus: Tennessee beat Florida in overtime
last year primarily because the Gators committed five turnovers.
And the Vols think they've earned the right to talk?
</P>
<P>
   ``They beat us one year, off our mistakes, and they're suddenly
the team on top of everything,'' running back Robert Gillespie
said. ``I don't know what they feel like they've done, but we just
have to go out and beat them and prove they came up lucky last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They won the national title last year, so I guess they have a
little rap right now,'' safety Marquand Manuel said. ``They can rap
as much as they want. But they have to fly down on Saturday and
prove their point. We're going to prove ours, too.''
</P>
<P>
   End Thaddeus Bullard said: ``They better come down here for a
60-minute fight, or they'll be embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   These attitudes, however, are new. Starting in 1916, Tennessee
and Florida met 19 times before 1990. Tennessee's biggest rival was
Alabama. Florida's rivals were Florida State and Georgia. But the
Vols and Gators have met every year starting in since 1990, which
coincidentally is the year Spurrier became coach at Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Since then:
</P>
<P>
   _After Tennessee trounced Spurrier's first Florida team 45-3,
Spurrier and Volunteers coach Johnny Majors almost came to blows at
a social function in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   _In 1991, Vicky Fulmer, wife of then-assistant Phillip Fulmer,
was abused physically as she walked to her seat in Gainesville. She
vowed never to return to Florida without an escort.
</P>
<P>
   _In 1997, Florida tackle Mo Collins said Tennessee quarterback
Peyton Manning was ``overrated,'' drawing the ire of Volunteers
everywhere. Florida won 33-20 after Tony George returned a Manning
interception 89 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   _Last year Florida players said they and their families were
roughed up in the aftermath of the Tennessee win.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line for the Gators: There is a reason they have won 29
straight in the Swamp. One win by Tennessee, they say, has not
turned this rivalry around.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they come in here, I expect the streak to get to 30,''
defensive end Alex Brown said. ``They don't have room to talk. We
slipped up last year. They won in overtime, and they won the
national championship with an undefeated year. Great. Do it again.
Beat us here and then you can get all the respect you want. We
don't lose here.''

 &HT;    Reeves recalls `Opie' Gailey
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Falcons coach Dan Reeves had Cowboys coach Chan Gailey
on his staff in Denver from 1985-90, and both are natives of
Americus. Reeves even coached Gailey in youth baseball, and has
described him as ``one of those kids you kind of fall in love with
the first time you meet them. He was always there every day with a
smile on his face.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves even compared the young Gailey to ``Opie,'' the
red-haired boy on the old ``Andy Griffith Show'' set in Mayberry,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
   On a teleconference Thursday, Gailey was asked the size of
Americus, in southwest Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a little bit bigger than Mayberry,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   The next question was, ``Is Mayberry a neighboring community?''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey didn't miss a beat: ``No, Mayberry is where Andy Griffith
lived.''
</P>
<P>
   Injury update
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Chris Chandler (strained right hamstring) was joined
Thursday in the ``doubtful'' category on the injury report by
cornerback Michael Booker (partially torn quadriceps muscle) and
defensive tackle Ben Huff (sprained foot). Wide receiver Tim Dwight
(strained right hamstring) returned to practice, and was upgraded
from doubtful to questionable. ... The Cowboys' injury report is
unchanged: Tight end Mike Lucky (foot) and cornerback Kevin Smith
(back) are out; cornerback Deion Sanders (toe) is doubtful; tight
end David LaFleur (ankle), wide receiver Jeff Ogden (thigh) and
strong safety Darren Woodson (biceps) are probable.
</P>
<P>
   Facility update
</P>
<P>
   The deadline for deciding on the future location of Falcons
headquarters _ whether to stay in Suwanee and expand, or move
northeast to Hall County _ keeps getting pushed back. Actually,
there is no deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see a decision happening this week,'' said Falcons
vice president of corporate development Tommy Nobis.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say we want to be there in the middle of next August, or
next September ... that is not the priority anymore. The priority
is to get the land, and the cost, and then talk about ... dates we
could get into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast facts
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said if Dwight can't play, running back Byron Hanspard,
who returned two kickoffs for touchdowns as a rookie in 1997,
probably would return kickoffs in his place. Wide receiver Ronnie
Harris probably would return punts. ... The Falcons are 5-15 on
Monday nights, losing eight straight and 11 of 12. ... A call by
the Falcons' front office to the NFL to seek an interpretation of
the pass interference call against cornerback Ray Buchanan when he
was defending Minnesota's Randy Moss was fruitless. The bottom
line: Calls like that usually are left entirely up to the
official's interpretation.

 &HT;    Chandler barely better, so Graziani expecting to start
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The strained right hamstring of Falcons quarterback
Chris Chandler barely improved Thursday, and it appears third-year
pro Tony Graziani will get his third career start Monday at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler aggravated the hamstring injury in a 17-14 loss to the
Vikings and hasn't practiced since. He jogged slowly Thursday, and
coach Dan Reeves said, ``I think it would take a miracle'' for the
12-year veteran to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can run for longer distances, but I still can't run very
fast,'' Chandler said. ``It's better than it was, and hopefully by
(today) I'll be able to practice.''
</P>
<P>
   That appears doubtful, like Chandler's official status, although
Reeves said he might wait until just before Monday's 9 p.m. game to
make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Graziani's first two starts, also on the road, were last Nov. 29
at St. Louis, and as a rookie, Oct. 26, 1997, at Carolina.
Graziani, a seventh-round draft choice from Oregon in '97, was
replaced at halftime in both games. Atlanta beat the Rams last
year, and lost to the Panthers in '97.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, Reeves and others refer to Graziani's increased
awareness, although it was hard to detect in the preseason when he
amassed a 53.9 passer rating in just two quarters. The left-handed
passer was slowed in the preseason after getting poked in the eye
in one game and spraining a knee in another.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he beat out Danny Kanell, who had a 44.1 rating and seven
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we can get the job done with Tony,'' running back
Jamal Anderson said. ``He's more comfortable in the offense, and
we're more comfortable with him.'' ``Every kid's dream growing up
is to play on Monday Night Football,'' Graziani said. ``Last year,
I got a real nervous energy from everyone (before starting at St.
Louis), and this year everyone is real relaxed, happy I'm the
backup.'' After going 0-6 in '97 in games Chandler missed or left
with an injury, the team was 4-1 in games like that last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our preparation is that Chris is not going to be there,''
Reeves said, ``and if he is, that's a plus.

 &HT;    Ferraro has goal on ice
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The ``Hockey Club of the South'' type of surroundings
Thursday served as a nice backdrop for Ray Ferraro's skate down
memory lane. Fifteen seasons, 1,020 games, 346 goals _ these eyes
have seen a few things that some of the younger ones at nearby
lockers never will.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days of two showers and two light bulbs at the Boston
Garden are long gone,'' the Thrashers center said after his first
skate in Philips Arena. ``Rats were everywhere, but they had to
live someplace, too. I wonder where they went when they knocked
that place down?''
</P>
<P>
   And The Aud in Buffalo. ``A dump,'' Ferraro said, as he runs
down the list of former hockey venues. ``It's a storage facility
now. That's what it should have been all along.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro would like to believe his new home is more than
temporary quarters. At 35, he is the Thrashers' oldest player, No.
1 center and most likely player to score 20 goals this season _
which means that the team is as desperate as he is eager to prove
that he belongs here.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the signs have been positive, except for the mandatory
ice bags after games. Ferraro still skates hard. He scored a goal
the other night in St. Louis. His surgically repaired knees are
fine, and he wishes everybody would stop asking and holding their
breath every times he falls or rams the boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``My health is not an issue,'' he said. ``I feel better than I
have in three years.''
</P>
<P>
   He will not try to convince you that he is as mobile as he was
at 20, when he skated into the Montreal Forum for the first time,
in his second pro game, an obscure former fifth-round draft pick of
the Hartford Whalers trying to prove his worth in historic
surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched that place on Hockey Night in Canada (telecasts) as
a little kid,'' Ferraro said. ``I remember skating onto the ice _ I
was in awe. Stanley Cup banners were hanging from corner to corner.
That was a big night for me. We got clobbered, 10-5, but I got my
first goal and three assists.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about having a hand in four out of five Hartford
goals, Ferraro said, ``Yeah, but I think I had a hand in a few of
their 10, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He has had 11 seasons of 20 or more goals, three 30 or more, two
40 or more. But the numbers that follow him into this year are 19
and 42 _ his total goals and games missed because of injury,
respectively, in the past two seasons. He has had cartilage removed
from his left knee twice and his right knee once.
</P>
<P>
   Asked which was the bad knee, Ferraro smiled and said, ``I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he said, ``I wear the brace on the left one, if that means
anything. That one's a little more challenged.''
</P>
<P>
   Challenged. He had a challenge last year in Los Angeles, and
Ferraro didn't think he was up to it. He went into the season
believing it was his last. His knees ached and, in part because of
Kings coach Larry Robinson's conservative system, the sport ceased
being enjoyable. Ferraro scored two goals in the first half of the
season. But in the second half, his knees started feeling better,
frustrations melted away, and he scored 11 goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out the rest of the year how much I still loved the
game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro doesn't have a negative word to say about Robinson, but
he said, ``I don't think I was put in a situation where I could
perform well.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro hasn't saved a lot of memorabilia through the years. But
he did keep a few items from his 1,000th career game last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only 136 guys have done it, so it must mean something,'' he
said. ``Hopefully, I'll be durable enough for a lot more.

 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The man who walked into the Wedgwood Baptist
Church here on Wednesday did not look like he belonged to the
congregation. No one apparently knew Larry Gene Ashbrook or what
this man in blue jeans and a black leather jacket might want.
People would later learn that he was a jobless loner, an ex-sailor
prone to foul moods and feared by several of his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   But at that moment, the only thing that seemed strange was that
he was smoking a cigarette in church. A janitor approached him
about the cigarette, and the authorities say Ashbrook shot him. He
shot a woman sitting nearby in the head. And then he followed the
sounds of music and voices into the main sanctuary where hundreds
of teen-agers had gathered for a contemporary Christian music
concert. He walked inside and began firing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were crying,'' said Bob Bollinger, a Sunday school
director. ``They didn't understand it. They were in shock.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the night was over, seven people were killed, three
of them teen-agers, and Ashbrook became the eighth fatality when he
turned the gun on himself. Seven other people were wounded, two of
whom remained in critical condition Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators gathered evidence about Ashbrook's rampage and
as local officials sought to comfort a grieving city, the suspect
emerged as an angry, desperate man who apparently had called two
local newspapers in recent months to say he fantasized about serial
killers.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton decried the attack and offered
the nation's sympathy to the victims, their families and the people
of Fort Worth. ``Yet again, we have seen a sanctuary violated by
gun violence, taking children brimming with faith and promise and
hope, before their time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential front runner,
canceled campaign appearances Thursday in Michigan and went to the
hospital in Fort Worth to comfort the families of the victims. Even
as people expressed horror that such a brutal attack could happen
in a house of worship, Fort Worth Mayor Kenneth Barr alluded to the
recent string of mass shootings across the country, notably the
school attack at Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fort Worth isn't the first place to have this kind of
tragedy,'' Barr said. ``My great fear is it won't be the last.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Mendoza, the Fort Worth acting police chief, said
Ashbrook, 47, apparently screamed insults about ``the Baptist
religion'' during the shooting, but investigators had not yet
discerned his motives. Ashbrook did not leave a suicide note or any
written evidence of his intentions, the police chief said. He lived
several miles from Wedgwood Baptist, and members of the church had
no idea why he chose them as a target.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was saying, `Your religion is nothing, it's not worth
anything, it means nothing,''' said Mary Beth Talley, 17, who was
wounded in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Local police and federal agents with the FBI and the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Thursday morning searched the home
Ashbrook had shared with his late parents and uncovered the raw
materials for a pipe bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said Ashbrook threw a pipe bomb into the front of the
sanctuary during his attack.
</P>
<P>
   Officers also found at the house what Mendoza called ``ledgers''
or ``journals.'' Mendoza said: ``These were things sometimes that
were written as far back as possibly the 1980s and are complaints.
He's complaining about people. He's complaining about his job. He
believes people are out to get him.''
</P>
<P>
   As details from the shootings emerged, church members told of
acts of heroism. As Ashbrook sprayed bullets from two handguns,
teenagers ducked for cover in the pews. But Heather McDonald, a
young woman with Down's Syndrome, remained sitting upright,
apparently confused. Ms. Talley shielded the girl with her body as
the suspect fired and hit her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just kept saying to Heather, `You've got to be quiet and
stay down with me,''' Ms. Talley said Thursday. Even after she was
shot, Ms. Talley kept comforting her friend. ``I just wanted to
make sure she was calm.''
</P>
<P>
   Another church member, S.M. ``Chip'' Gillette, was watching
television in his nearby home when he noticed his dog, Jake,
standing atop a chest and barking furiously at the window. An off
duty Fort Worth police officer, Gillette saw people streaming out
of the church. He radioed for police help, grabbed his service
revolver and rushed inside the front door with a uniformed officer
who had just arrived at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette said he ran toward the gunshots and arrived just after
Ashbrook shot himself as he sat in a back pew of the church.
Investigators said Ashbrook used semi-automatic handguns, a 9 mm
Ruger and a .380-caliber AMT. He fired at least 30 shots, and
officers found 10 Ruger ammunition clips in his pockets and near
his body. He bought both guns in February 1992 at licensed firearms
dealers in a flea market-type operation called Trader's Village,
just outside Fort Worth, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that Ashbrook may have brought more than one pipe bomb
into the church, investigators had sent in robotic bomb-sweeping
equipment in the hours after the attack. No other explosives were
found, and the bodies of the victims were removed from the
sanctuary early Thursday morning, about five hours after the
attack.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; (MORE)
</P>
<P>
   To a large degree, Ashbrook remains a puzzle to investigators.
At least publicly, Mendoza and other officials said they weren't
certain of his motives. However, he had apparently called the local
Fort Worth Star-Telegram and an alternative newspaper, FW Weekly in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
   In an angry, rambling discourse, Ashbrook told a reporter at FW
Weekly that he fantasized about serial killers, particularly Ricky
Lee Green, a mass murderer who was from Fort Worth who was executed
in 1997 for four killings in Texas and was linked to at least eight
other deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook lived in modest brick ranch house in Forest Hills, a
lower-middle-class bedroom community in southeast Fort Worth, about
seven miles from the church. At age 47, Ashbrook was the youngest
of five siblings, and he lived at home with his elderly father,
Jack, until he died two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   His father had retired after 35 years as a switchman for the
Missouri-Kansas-Texas railroad, and had been a fixture at the
Pleasant Ridge Church of Christ for 40 years. Neighbors said the
suspect had been close to his mother, Ethel Muriel Ashbrook, who
died in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could never tell what kind of mood swing he was in, so I
kept away from him,'' said Venita Hord, 50, who lived directly
across the street. ``I never did trust him.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, as Mrs. Hord and another neighbor sat in her
yard, Ashbrook pulled up and saw them laughing. Apparently thinking
he was laughing at him, he slammed shut his car door and unzipped
his pants, exposing himself. Mrs. Hord said she had not spoken to
him since, even though she saw him almost every day.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said Ashbrook had apparently never been treated for any
mental illness nor sought any such help. His police record shows
only one arrest, a 1971 conviction for marijuana possession.
</P>
<P>
   Records show that Ashbrook had a spotty education record and was
in and out of the U.S. Navy. He enrolled in Tarrant County College
in 1971, when he was 19, taking classes in remedial English,
creative design, math, guitar and physical education. He served at
least two stints in the Navy, the second from 1977 to 1983,
according to a spokesman for the Department of Veterans Affairs in
Dallas. In the Navy, he was a sonar operator on a P-3 Orion plane.
That type of plane tracks and destroys enemy submarines.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said he rarely spoke to anyone. Mrs. Horde said she
knew when he was home because he always slammed the door shut and
often kicked it open. She said she could hear the noise across the
street. Other neighbors often heard him arguing with his father,
sometimes over borrowing his car. And everyone noticed one strange
habit: he always carried a blue canvas bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never knew what his attitude would be,'' said Janet
Gabhardt, 28, another neighbor. Asked if she was shocked that
Ashbrook had become violent, she said, ``I wasn't shocked, I wasn't
shocked at all.'' Childhood friends remembered him as a loner and
an oddball who mumbled and talked to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry had turned weird,'' said James Branum, who grew up a
block away and last saw Ashbrook six months ago. ``He was always
strange to me a little bit.'' Branum and others said he never held
a steady job. ``He wouldn't work,'' Branum said. ``When his daddy
died he got the house because nobody was left, but he couldn't pay
for it. I guess he figured everything was so bad he took his own
life. It's so sad with all these kids.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, the sanctuary at Wedgwood Baptist was filled
with teen-agers from several area churches who had gathered to
celebrate ``See You at the Pole,'' a national movement to affirm
the Christian faith of schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The police said Ashbrook paced back and forth in the back of the
sanctuary, firing several times into the congregation. He reloaded
two or three times, then lit the fuse to his pipe bomb and tossed
it to the front of the church. The bomb exploded, sending shrapnel
into the walls and floor, but Mendoza said it caused little damage.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Gillette, the off-duty officer, and the uniformed
officer rushed into the sanctuary, Ashbrook pointed the Ruger at
his own head and pulled the trigger. Asked if the shooting had
shaken his religious faith, Gillette answered, ``If it affects your
faith, you have no faith.''
</P>
<P>
   At least two prayer services were held Thursday, and Gillette
said the church planned to hold two services at the sanctuary on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, one of the last people who saw Ashbrook before he
drove to the church was a neighbor, Matthew White. White said he
had been praying earlier in the day and felt a calling from God to
take Ashbrook to church. He said he did not know Ashbrook and had
never spoken to him but regarded him as lonely and desperate. ``It
was such a strong thought I said I was going to do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But White saw Ashbrook in his car early Wednesday evening and
assumed ``I'd missed the opportunity.'' As White and his wife drove
to church, he said he kept thinking about Ashbrook. White, who is
black, thought Ashbrook might be uncomfortable in his church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking, `I wonder what church could I send him to?'''

 &HT;    Braves: Injured wrist has slowed Jordan's roll
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Three nights ago, Brian Jordan drove in two runs in
one game, an event once so ordinary that he did it four times in
five days during his first month of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The moment described where the Braves' most productive hitter
started and the strange place he has landed now. If April
determined that Jordan indeed could replace Andres Galarraga as
Atlanta's cleanup hitter, September wonders how Jordan can continue
performing as half of himself.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' final drive, which begins tonight with a home
weekend series against Montreal, is crammed with uncertainties,
ranging from the onrushing New York Mets to the alignment of
manager Bobby Cox's October rotation. But in a larger way, with
club scoring having slipped to 16th in the major leagues at 5.2
runs a game, Jordan is the focal point.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether a team with championship aspirations can
get along with a cleanup hitter who, while coping with a serious
wrist problem, has become one of the least effective in the game.
The Braves might be better suited by change.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Cox) doesn't do that, which is good,'' hitting coach Don
Baylor said. ``Without Brian Jordan for the first three-quarters of
the year picking up the slack in the four-spot ... Every time we
needed an RBI with two out, he got it. He's earned that right.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's season reads like one giant downward gradient. When
Montreal's Mike Thurman, who starts for the Expos tonight, struck
Jordan on the outside base of his right hand at Turner Field on
June 22, Jordan was averaging an RBI every 4.7 at-bats. Since Aug.
1, as the condition has worsened with the discovery of a bone spur,
that rate has dropped to one every 6.4 at-bats. Since receiving
three cortisone injections in both wrists Aug. 25, Jordan has
driven in a run every 11.2 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   His batting average, weighted by an 8-for-50 September, is down
to a season-low .285. His average with runners in scoring position,
which stood at .341 six weeks ago, has been .250 (10-for-40) since.
He hasn't hit a home run in 92 at-bats, dating back to Aug. 16. He
admits that he is scared to swing, unable to overcome the pain that
has converted him into a singles hitter, an awful decline for a
player highly regarded for handling the fastball.
</P>
<P>
   No one is more despondent about the situation than Jordan, who
has fought injury most of his career. Playing his first full season
without incident in 1998, he posted career highs in eight offensive
categories and was well on his way to outperforming himself this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he would accept moving out of the clean-up slot, he
replied, ``If he wants to put someone else in there, it makes no
difference to me. As long as I'm in the lineup, I'm happy.

   GAME OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   Oakland (0-1) vs. Minnesota (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: Raiders (409) _ yardage allowed Green Bay. Vikings (8
of 9) _ home openers won.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: The Raiders led Green Bay late and then stood by
helplessly as the Packers kept driving for big yards and big points
for a last-second victory. Now Oakland hits the road again in its
second of three straight against the National Football Conference
Central division. What it will find in Minnesota is a team eager to
duplicate last season's offensive exploits, a team yearning to blow
its offense open en route. Oakland allowed 409 yards and 28 points
at Green Bay. Look for improvement, but not enough, in a testy
battle featuring big plays.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Vikings, 26-20.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY, 1 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Washington (0-1) vs. Giants (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: Redskins (3-6-1) _ Turner's record vs. Giants. Giants
(plus 5) _ turnover differential.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Mike Nolan, the Redskins' defensive coordinator, used
to hold that job with the Giants but now works under Norv Turner,
Washington's embattled head coach. When Nolan left three years ago,
many Giants thought they had lost one of the best defensive minds
around. But John Fox replaced him and has made Nolan a distant
memory. Fox leads a group that scored more points (14) last week
than many offenses did, including the Giants'. Washington's offense
streaked toward 504 yards and 35 points against Dallas last week,
and the Redskins still lost. It is a magical matchup _ the
Washington offense against the Giants' defense. Take the Giants'
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Giants, 21-17.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay (1-0) vs. Detroit (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: Packers (4.3) _ Levens' average yards per run. Lions
(6.0) _ Rivers' average yards per run.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: So Ron Rivers is outrunning Dorsey Levens? Rivers, the
retired Barry Sanders' replacement, rushed 16 times for 96 yards in
Detroit's rousing 28-20 victory at Seattle. Charlie Batch threw
three touchdown passes, Robert Porcher made three sacks and the
Lions' defense held Mike Holmgren's ballyhooed offensive system and
players to 205 yards. Of course, doing that to Brett Favre and the
Packers will be more challenging. Look for Favre, again, to win it
late.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Packers, 24-20.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis (1-0) vs. New England (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: Colts _ (1) '98 division victories. Patriots (14-4) _
in last 18 at home.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Indianapolis won one American Football Conference East
division game last year. Having beaten Buffalo last week, it can
double that number for this season. It will attempt to do so
against a team that usually shakes the Colts silly. Patriots
quarterback Drew Bledsoe owns a career-most nine victories against
the Colts. In his last five games against them, he has thrown 11
touchdown passes and one interception and earned a 108.4
quarterback rating. The Patriots hope they have found a solid
running threat in the veteran Terry Allen. Their defensive stars
(Ty Law, Willie McGinnest, Lawyer Milloy, Chris Slade) made huge
plays at big times against the Jets. New England played confidently
against the Jets and will illustrate even more confidence here.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Patriots, 21-14.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh (1-0) vs. Baltimore (0-1)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: Steelers (40) _ yards allowed vs. Browns. Ravens
(44.6) _ Mitchell quarterback rating.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Scott Mitchell, the Ravens' quarterback, needs a strong
showing. He got a second chance as a starter this year after things
blew up for him in Detroit last year. His start last week against
St. Louis _ 17-of-40 for 188 yards with a touchdown and two
interceptions in a 27-10 loss _ was lackluster. Nothing like what
Kordell Stewart did, attacking the Cleveland Browns on the ground
and in the air with a display of quickness and arm strength and
precision that made Steelers fans hopeful. Are they back? Why, yes,
for the moment, they are.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Steelers, 19-17.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay (0-1) vs. Philadelphia (0-1)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: Buccaneers (minus 5) _ turnover differential. Eagles
(103) _ Staley rushing yards.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Duce Staley is a diminutive running back who is fun to
watch. He hits holes quickly and keeps chucking _ this Eagles back
has gained 100 or more yards from scrimmage in each of his last
seven games. He is one of the few bright spots for the Eagles,
losers again last week in painful fashion, 25-24, against Arizona.
Now come the Buccaneers and their stressed-out quarterback, Trent
Dilfer, who absolutely needs a big game, a victory. He is on the
verge of getting benched for good after just two '99 starts. His
last one was lousy (two interceptions returned for touchdowns)
against the Giants. This one is better.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Buccaneers, 16-13.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego (0-0) vs. Cincinnati (0-1)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: (0) _ 100-yard rushers allowed. Bengals (90) _ QB
Blake's rushing yards.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: That's right, the Chargers did not allow a 100-yard
rusher in 1998. They didn't play last week, the only NFL team to
have be a bye on opening weekend. How strange for the Chargers to
be the only team at home watching the season unfold and pass them
by? There is time to catch up, right now. As a matter of fact, each
team in their division (AFC West) lost last week, so the Chargers
are in first place at 0-0. If only the Bengals could gain a bye
every week. They lost another game in sorry fashion, 36-35, at
Tennessee, wilting when it counted most. Both teams follow their
current suits.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Chargers, 27-21.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona (1-0) vs. Miami (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: Cardinals (4) _ winning streak. Dolphins (25-9) _
September record in '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Arizona had not won four consecutive regular-season
games since 1988. It is winning with quarterback Jake Plummer, who
owns 10 comeback victories in his 27 Cardinals games. What a
thrilling victory for the Cardinals at Philadelphia, but now they
are matched against a team riding high after dumping Denver on
Monday night. This is no time to let down, and the Dolphins won't.
Dan Marino has never lost to the Cardinals in three games and has
never thrown an interception against them compared with his seven
touchdowns. Miami has never lost to the Cardinals, going 7-0 all
time. Make it 8-0.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Dolphins, 30-20.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle (0-1) vs. Chicago (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: Seahawks (7,894) _ Watters' career rush yards. Bears
(16) _ passing first downs.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Chicago beat Kansas City and Seattle lost to Detroit
last week. Most expected those results to be opposite. Not the
Bears. Under Dick Jauron, their new coach, the Bears are refreshed
and optimistic. Playing at home for a second straight week is a
plus. But Seattle Coach Mike Holmgren has won 10 straight over the
Bears and is 6-1 in Soldier Field. He knows them. His quarterback,
Jon Kitna, earned a 107.9 quarterback rating last week against
Detroit. He did not earn enough big plays to win, but his
performance was solid. Another good showing from Kitna and more
running from Ricky Watters will make the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Seahawks, 16-9.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY, 4 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland (0-1) vs. Tennessee (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: Browns (2) _ first downs vs. Pittsburgh. Titans (162)
_ Dyson's record yards.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: After a pitiful offensive showing against Pittsburgh,
Cleveland has chosen to move the heralded rookie Tim Couch into the
starting quarterback slot. Is Couch ready? Well, Ty Detmer
certainly wasn't. He struggled mightily as the starter against
Pittsburgh (6-of-12 for 52 yards, an interception and a quarterback
rating of 25.2). Tennessee struggled early against Cincinnati
before compiling 403 yards of offense, 162 of it by receiver Kevin
Dyson. Tennessee has won seven consecutive division games. Al Del
Greco has converted a club-record 19 consecutive field goals.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Titans, 31-17.
</P>
<P>
   Denver (0-1) vs. Kansas City (0-1)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: (61) _ Davis' rushing yards. Chiefs (8.96) _ average
gain on first down.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: After Denver's debacle against Miami on Monday night,
the Dolphins felt sure that Terrell Davis was still hurting from a
shoulder injury. He rushed for only 61 yards and left for much of
the fourth quarter. His team exited for much of the game. The
Broncos hope to rebound in Arrowhead Stadium, where they won, 30-7,
last year in what was the signature game for the Chiefs' deplorable
season. It was the game in which the Chiefs unraveled, showing
their frustration with a bushel of ugly personal foul penalties.
Denver seeks improvement. Kansas City seeks retribution. Take the
angry team.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Chiefs, 24-21.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans (1-0) vs. San Francisco (0-1)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: Saints (12) _ sacks in last two games. 49ers (17) _
home winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Big game for the Saints, a confidence builder against
the team that has dominated this division in the .90s. Big game for
the 49ers after last week's blowout loss (41-3) at Jacksonville.
Hands are wringing in San Francisco. Is this it? Are the good times
gone? Can quarterback Steve Young do it anymore? Young needs help,
especially from the running game. Charlie Garner and Lawrence
Phillips need to produce more at running back. If the 49ers get it,
they win easily. They do.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: 49ers, 36-17.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY 8 P.M. GAME
</P>
<P>
   Jets (0-1) vs. Buffalo (0-1)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: Jets (194) _ Johnson record yards. Bills (20) _
Flutie incompletions.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Both teams seek to avert not only an 0-2 start but also
an 0-2 division start. The Jets turn to Rick Mirer at quarterback
and hope that Keyshawn Johnson (eight catches, career-high 194
receiving yards against New England) can maintain his fast pace. It
is the Jets' first chance to show what they can do without the
injured Vinny Testaverde. Flutie was all over the place in his
team's loss at Indianapolis. Flutie completed only 22-of-42 passes
in the scrambling mode that is his game. The Jets will try to box
him, keep him contained and let the game boil down to Curtis Martin
vs. Antowain Smith at running back. Martin can win that battle.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Jets, 17-14.
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY NIGHT GAME
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta (0-1) vs. Dallas (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: Falcons (minus 3) _ turnover differential. Cowboys
(541) _ offensive yards.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Atlanta lost to Minnesota because the Falcons kept
dropping the ball. Dallas beat Washington in overtime because the
Cowboys kept getting the ball into the end zone. If those trends
continue, it will be a troublesome start for Atlanta. If Chris
Chandler (hamstring) plays, he has a chance to improve on his 20-9
record as the Falcons' starter. Expect Chandler to make it _ he has
not played in a Monday night game in 11 years. Dallas will win with
special-teams play and with the arm of Troy Aikman and hands and
fleet feet of Rocket Ismail in another pitch-and-catch deep-passing
display.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Cowboys, 23-21.

 &UR; ENCRYPT &LR;  _ Silicon Valley scored another big win in Washington
yesterday, as the Clinton administration, reversing a decades-old
policy, said it will allow U.S. firms to export powerful computer
technology that scrambles data to keep it private. By Henry Norr

   &UR; PUC  &LR; _ Consumers fed up with changing area codes every few
months and angered at the prospect of having to dial 11 digits to
make a local call scored a victory yesterday when California
regulators scrapped the state's existing overlay and set the stage
for the elimination of overlays and splits across the state. A
decision late Wednesday by the Federal Communications Commission
that gives California more leeway in how it assigns area codes
prompted the state Public Utilities Commission to end the 310 area
code overlay and begin a process that will halt the seemingly
endless stream of area code changes in California. The ruling is
good news for Bay Area residents, who are facing at least five

doesn't directly impact any area code overlay other than the one in

 Encryption Exports OKd by White House
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Henry Norr &LR;

 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Silicon Valley scored another big win in Washington yesterday, as
the Clinton administration, reversing a decades-old policy, said it
will allow U.S. firms to export powerful computer technology that
scrambles data to keep it private.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said it will draft new regulations permitting
high-tech companies to sell even their most powerful encryption
technologies ``in retail form'' to any overseas customers,
including most governments.
</P>
<P>
   The decision shows politicians' increasing desire to court
Silicon Valley, even over the objections of law enforcement and
national security experts, who have long argued that strong
encryption makes it harder for them to fight terrorists and other
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is huge,'' said Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., who along with
Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-San Jose, whose district includes &LR;  Silicon
Valley,  &LR; has been championing legislation to eliminate the
encryption export controls.
</P>
<P>
   Technology-industry officials, who have fought for years for
liberalization of encryption exports, said the administration's
move met most of their demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they actually implement everything they've announced, then
this is a major breakthrough,'' said Jim cq &LR; Bidzos, vice chairman
of RSA Security, a leading vendor of security and encryption
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased _ we got 80 percent of what we wanted,''
said Roszel cq &LR; Thomsen, counsel for the Alliance for Network
Security, a year-old lobbying group that includes such high-tech
heavyweights as 3Com, Cisco, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Lucent,
Microsoft, Network Associates, Nortel Networks, Novell and Sun
Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   Technology industry officials warned, however, that many
critical details remain to be ironed out. One of the key issues,
they said, will be the definition of retail sales, since more
restrictions will remain for products the government will classify
as nonretail. Yesterday's announcements also appeared to focus
exclusively on finished goods, leaving tech officials wondering
about the status of component products such as encryption chips and
software tool kits.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. vendors will have to submit products for a one-time
government review, but they will not have to go through the complex
licensing process under which such sales were often prohibited in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   The only countries where exports of U.S. encryption products are
still banned are those the government considers terrorist nations:
Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Sudan, North Korea and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates, who have generally joined with the high-tech
industry to demand freer exports of data-scrambling products,
welcomed the new announcements, but expressed more skepticism about
the detailed regulations, which are due December 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our filing cabinets are littered with White House press
releases claiming major policy changes in the past, and ultimately
they turned out not to be,'' said Alan Davidson, an attorney at the
Center for Democracy and Technologies, a privacy and civil
liberties advocacy group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He added, though, ``There's a level of specificity here that
will make it very difficult for them to back away.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Worries Over Secret Codes
</P>
<P>
   Davidson and other civil libertarians said they are especially
concerned about other initiatives the White House announced
yesterday, including legislation that might make it easier under
some circumstances for law-enforcement officials to obtain ``keys''
_ secret codes _ that would enable them to read data U.S. citizens
have tried to secure by encryption.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno also said the government will fund a
new ``technical support center'' at the FBI to help law-enforcement
authorities respond to the increased use of encryption by
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Washington observers cited a number of factors coming together
to explain why the White House has now  &LR; changed its tune on
encryption exports.
</P>
<P>
   One, of course, is the upcoming election, for which both parties
are courting Silicon Valley donations and support from &LR;  Silicon
Valley &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the U.S. House  &LR; House of Representatives is moving
toward consideration of legislation that would have &LR;   &LR; completely
eliminated &LR;  export controls on encryption products. More than half
the members of the House have signed on as co-sponsors of the bill,
known as the Security and Freedom through Encryption (SAFE) Act,
written by Virginia's Goodlatte.
</P>
<P>
   Still another factor, observers said, was a growing move to ease
restrictions on export of similar products from European countries.
Just this month, Germany announced substantial liberalization of
its policies, and several other countries, as well as the European
Union as a whole, have been taking steps in the same direction.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. vendors have long argued that the only real effect of the
country's restrictive policies was to keep them out of foreign
markets, without preventing users abroad from obtaining encryption
products elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both parties are desperate to woo Silicon Valley,'' said RSA
Security's Bidzos. ``This is where the growth in the economy is,
this is where the money is.''
</P>
<P>
   Bidzos, for example, said foreign competitors have been
increasingly ``winning business we can't even go after because our
hands are tied behind our backs by our very own government.''
</P>
<P>
   The Software and Information Industry Association, another
high-tech trade group, projects that global sales of encryption
products could reach $20 billion by 2002.

 MySimon.com Says Startup Stole Ideas
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By David Lazarus &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Santa Clara's MySimon.com, which offers an online price-comparison
service, has filed a complaint in U.S. District Court against a
startup firm in Texas for allegedly pilfering both its technology
and content.
</P>
<P>
   Priceman.com, based in Houston, is nothing more than a copy of
MySimon that uses MySimon's own search engine for its price
listings, the complaint charges.
</P>
<P>
   It also alleges that text on Priceman's site duplicated that of
MySimon's site.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Priceman posted a message to visitors yesterday
explaining that it is a ``meta-search'' engine that scours listings
on other sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Priceman.com is the currently ... the  &LR; first and only site to
do a meta search on Price Engines (or as some call them `Shopping
Comparison engines'),'' the message states. ``We pass on your
search string to numerous other Price Engines, get the product
pricing information from them, compile all this information, and
present it to the user.''
</P>
<P>
   The message says Priceman is trying to address MySimon's
complaint, but ``we believe that our meta-search capabilities do
not violate any existing infringement laws and have therefore not
done anything wrong since there are numerous meta-search engines on
the market that do the same thing we do.''
</P>
<P>
   It also chides MySimon for pursuing legal action instead of
trying to ``settle their problem in an amicable fashion.'' It
accuses the larger firm of trying to drive it out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, countered Josh Goldman, CEO of MySimon. ``We would have
been happy to discuss it with them if they wanted to pursue a
business relationship,'' he said. ``But they just repurposed our
content for their site.''
</P>
<P>
   The most ``flagrant'' example, Goldman said, was Priceman
allegedly taking MySimon's extensive online shopping guide and
substituting all references to ``MySimon'' with ``Priceman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There it was, page for page, word for word,'' he said. ``The
smoking gun was a page where they forgot to change `MySimon' to
`Priceman.'''
</P>
<P>
   Although Priceman shut down its service after the complaint was
filed Wednesday, Goldman said his company's lawyers have the
supposedly incriminating evidence archived for possible legal use.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that MySimon maintains relationships with about a dozen
other price-comparison services and said he would have been open to
a similar arrangement with Priceman.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they clearly took our design and original content without
crediting us,'' he said. ``That's not the proper way to do a
meta-search engine.''
</P>
<P>
   James Paul, a Priceman spokesman, said MySimon simply is
engaging in hardball tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They obviously see us as some kind of threat,'' he said.
``It's obviously a cheap way for them to get publicity for
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Priceman, which bills itself as ``Earth's biggest shopping
comparison engine,'' was launched in December. Its eight employees
all have day jobs elsewhere, and to date, the free service has run
no advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no revenues at all,'' Paul said. ``We don't have any
money.''
</P>
<P>
   But they do have pluck. Priceman tried last week to auction off
nearly half its equity on eBay for at least $10 million. EBay,
questioning the legality of auctioning stocks online, pulled the
plug on the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Paul said it's uncertain when, or if, Priceman will resume
operations.

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Plenty of teen-agers would rather watch
television or haunt the malls. But for young people like Justin
Laird and Kristi Beckel, Wednesday nights were meant for hanging
out at the Wedgwood Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   And this Wednesday night was meant for celebration _ rocking and
rolling and praying. Instead, there were screams.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Beckel, 14, was one of the seven people shot to death
inside the red brick church on Whitman Street on Wednesday. Laird,
a 16-year-old football player, was also shot. He lay paralyzed in a
Fort Worth hospital Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wednesday nights are special to a lot of kids'' said Adrienne
Moore, 20, who works at a Christian bookstore here. ``A lot of
teen-agers don't even belong to a church because their parents
don't go. So the Wednesday night services are all they've got.''
</P>
<P>
   Known for being hipper and looser than the usual Sunday worship
style, the Wednesday youth services are casual, sometimes
boisterous.
</P>
<P>
   A Christian rock band, The Forty Days, was performing at
Wedgwood on Wednesday night. They were playing a song called
``Alle, Allelulia,'' when the first shots rang out.
</P>
<P>
   The day had started with prayer for many students here and
around the nation. Students pray and hold hands as they encircle
flag poles at their schools in what has come to be known as ``See
You at the Pole Day.'' It is a way to embolden evangelical students
who might otherwise feel uneasy about praying in public.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Texas, a place where the Bible finds its way into
everyday talk, being seen as religious and a straight-arrow can be
difficult for a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear the mumbled profanities,'' Miss Moore said. ``People
call you a Jesus freak.''
</P>
<P>
   But for young people like Stefanie Robertson, 14, who belongs to
Wedgwood Baptist, the support of friends make any snickers seem
silly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church is really a kind of a cool place when all the kids
are there on Wednesday nights,'' Ms. Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   Schools in Fort Worth were given over to mourning Thursday.
``The teachers didn't even ask us to try to do any work,'' said
Nycole Dutton, 13, who knew some of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``You looked around at school,'' Miss Dutton said, ``and all you
saw was people crying.''
</P>
<P>
   At North Crowley High School, a football player named Brett
Parker led a huge clump of students out to the flagpole Thursday
morning where they prayed for a schoolmate, Cassandra Griffin, who
was killed.
</P>
<P>
   A youth minister, Johnny Derouen, spent the day talking to
grieving students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them what they told themselves, that you can't stop it
from happening but you can prepare for it,'' he said. ``We talked
about how if there are other students in our school who are lonely,
who are hurting, if we were more kind to them, it might stop them
from taking out their feelings on us.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also a sad day at Southwestern Baptist Theological
Seminary, where two of its students, Susan Jones, 23, and Shawn
Brown, 23, were remembered. Miss Jones, who was called Kim and who
was working with the children at the Baptist church, was one of
those who was shot to death. Brown, who also enjoyed working with
children, was also killed.
</P>
<P>
   Another of those slain was Sydney Browning, 36, a Southwestern
seminary graduate who was a teacher who worked with troubled
teen-agers. She served as children's choir director at Wedgwood
Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Meredith, the daughter of the Rev. Al Meredith, said she
considered Ms. Browning a martyr.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Laird, who celebrated his 16th birthday Wednesday, had
taken a driving test in his father's Chevrolet Blazer. That night
he lay on the floor bleeding, as his father, John Laird, pleaded
with his son to get up and flee the gunman, said Ben Davis, the
athletic director at Brewer High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``His father told me that when he saw him down on the floor,
bleeding, he said, `We've got to get out of here,' but Justin said
he couldn't move,'' Davis said. ``His dad dragged him out of there.
You'd think that if you sent your kid to church or school, he's in
good hands, he's safe. Its a tremendous shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Another of the gunman's victims, Joseph Ennis, was recalled
Thursday as a gregarious, upbeat, 14-year-old who spent every
moment he could on a basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Beckel, was a ``very sweet girl'' who liked to play
volleyball, said her former Sunday school teacher, Missy McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   Another victim was Justin Ray, 17, who was known for his
cheerfulness and his kind manner. ``You couldn't not like him,''
Miss Dutton said.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman, Larry Gene Ashbrook, 47, remained a mystery to the
people of Fort Worth. But some people said they included him in
their prayers as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``God died for the man who pulled the trigger, too,'' said Dan
Gill, the manager of a Christian bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   Posted on the Baptist church's web page Thursday were messages
of grief. ``Father, give us peace, even when we don't understand,''
one read in part.
</P>
<P>
   At the three Texas high schools that victims had attended,
special rooms were set aside for grieving students. And school
administrators said there was special concern for the trauma of the
dozens of students who had witnessed the shootings at the church,
and the hundreds more that were friends with the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some moms who said they wanted to take their children
out early and of course we said yes,'' said David Walker, principal
of North Crowley High School. The only positive is this is bringing
the kids closer together. You see them pulling together. But I
don't know how anyone makes sense of this.''

 Californians Pleased by Economy, Poll Finds
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Arthur M. Louis &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Californians are more upbeat about the state's economy than they
have been at any time in the past two decades, a new opinion poll
shows.
</P>
<P>
   In its annual survey on the state's ``Economic Well-Being,'' the
Field Institute of San Francisco found that 70 percent of
Californians think the economy is going through `'good times.''
</P>
<P>
   That is nine percentage points higher than a year ago, and by
far the strongest positive response since Field began asking the
question in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1994, with the state still mired in a long
recession, only 4 percent of the Field Poll respondents considered
the economy ``good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very positive report card for the economy,'' said
Mark DiCamillo, director of the Field Institute. ``It's also good
news for the economy, because these are consumers, and consumer
dollars move the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   However, while the bulk of the respondents in this year's poll
were upbeat about the present, they weren't necessarily optimistic
about the future.
</P>
<P>
   Field found that only 27 percent of Californians expect the
economy to ``get better'' during the next 12 months. That is down
from 34 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 52 percent said they expect `'periods of serious
economic downturn'' during the next five years. Last year, only 41
percent felt that way.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Gibson, chief economist with the state Department of
Finance, said reduced optimism is natural ``when things are going
well.'' He noted that in a strong economy people get nervous and
tend to wonder ``how long can this last?''
</P>
<P>
   Field conducted the poll from August 16 through 22, telephoning
1,010 adult Californians, including 230 from the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other findings:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _Fifty-two percent of those polled felt that their ``personal
financial well-being'' _ as distinguished from the condition of the
economy as a whole _ was better than it was a year ago. In the
previous poll, 55 percent felt that way.
</P>
<P>
   As one might expect, people with relatively high household
incomes seemed the most satisfied with their economic status.
Sixty-eight percent of those with incomes of $80,000 or higher said
they were better off than a year ago, while just 36 percent with
incomes of less than $20,000 said they were better off.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _Forty-four percent of the respondents said they expect to be
better off next year. That is down from 49 percent in the previous
survey.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _Twenty-eight percent think the stock market will move higher
next year, while 18 percent expect it to go lower and 44 percent
think it will remain about the same. Ten percent had no opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In the previous survey, 32 percent of the respondents expected
the market to rise, 18 percent expected a downturn, 39 expected
essentially no change and 11 percent had no opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The opinions of people from the Bay Area were generally in line
with those expressed by people living elsewhere in the state, said
Mark DiCamillo, director of the Field Institute.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bay Area residents tended to be more satisfied with
their personal economic status. Fifty-six percent said they were
better off than they were a year ago _ four percentage points
higher than the response for all California residents.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, only 39 percent of Bay Area residents thought
they would be better off a year from now _ five percentage points
less than for the state as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might interpret that as the Bay Area being a little ahead
of the curve,'' DiCamillo said. ``The Bay Area has been leading the
state's economic recovery, while Los Angeles has been trailing.
Now, more residents of L.A. are expecting better things, because
they are just beginning to feel the change for the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the people polled this year, 57 percent said they were
homeowners, while 43 percent were renters.
</P>
<P>
   Field found that slightly less than half the renters had
considered buying homes during the past year. Of those who
considered buying, 3 out of 5 cited high prices as the reason for
not doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Among Bay Area residents, 48 percent said they were renters.
Somewhat less than half considered buying homes during the past
year, and of that group, nearly two-thirds cited price as the
reason for backing down.
</P>
<P>
   The pollsters also posed a couple of questions that ranged
beyond economic concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The respondents were asked to give their opinions about the
``overall direction'' in which California and the United States are
heading.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-two percent thought California was heading in the
`'right'' direction, compared with 53 percent a year earlier.
Fifty-three percent felt the United States was heading in the right
direction _ down from 67 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very sensitive measure,'' DiCamillo said. ``It can
help in predicting elections, because it indicates whether there is
a mood for political change or for staying the course.''

 Rulings May Slow Spiraling Growth of Area Codes
<TEXT>

   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR;

<P>
   Two key rulings by government agencies this week could pull the
plug on four new area codes planned for the Bay Area that would
require callers to dial 11-digits, even when phoning their
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The first ruling came Wednesday night, when the Federal
Communications Commission gave California permission Wednesday &LR; 
night &LR;  to hand out new phone numbers in blocks of 1,000 instead of
10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The current system _ which gives phone companies numbers in
blocks of 10,000, no matter how many customers they have _ has
rapidly depleted the pool of available phone numbers and has
contributed to the spiraling need for more area codes.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the FCC's decision, which is expected to free up
additional telephone numbers, the state Public Utilities Commission
yesterday rescinded a controversial ``overlay'' plan for the 310
area code in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of dividing a region geographically and giving customers
in one half a new area code, an overlay lets existing customers
keep their area code and assigns a new area code to new phone
lines. The downside is that everyone in the overlay area must dial
11 digits _ 1 plus the area code plus the phone number _ on every
call, even when making calls to their own area code.
</P>
<P>
   Although the PUC's 3-to-2 ruling applied only to the 310 area
code, it could squelch plans for overlays in at least four area
codes in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, this is going to mean we do not have to resort to
overlays anyplace in the state,'' said Commissioner Joel Hyatt, who
recommended yesterday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC also told California regulators that it could force
phone companies such as Pacific Bell to disclose how many phone
numbers are actually in use and require them to release all unused
numbers, so they could be reassigned to other carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 180 million numbers assigned to California phone
companies, the PUC estimates that only 35 million are actually in
use.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell says that 86 percent of the numbers it has been
assigned are in use.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are about 150 phone companies in the state, and
many of them have few customers but at least 10,000 numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Freeing up unused numbers will prolong the life of each area
code, Hyatt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FCC order is going to make it considerably easier for us
to do something serious about trying to slow down the rate at which
area codes are created in California,'' said Helen Mickiewicz, an
attorney with the PUC. ``And that means in turn we can reduce the
enormous amount of hardship the public has had to endure as we keep
opening up new area codes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Bay Area, the 415, 510, 650 and 408 area codes are
scheduled to get overlays in the next two years. The PUC decision
will require phone companies to prove that the number supply in
those area codes is actually exhausted. If they cannot, the PUC
could issue a new order stopping the overlays.
</P>
<P>
   The first Bay Area overlay is scheduled to go into effect in the
408 region on October 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened in the 310 overlay would certainly raise
questions about other overlays that the commission has ordered,''
said Natalie Billingsley, a telecommunications expert with the PUC.
``As for 408, it would not be unreasonable for the commission to
reassess the decision it's already made in light of the extended
authority the FCC granted to us.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the PUC on Wednesday, Gov. Gray Davis urged
regulators to halt plans for overlays in 310 and 408.
</P>
<P>
   The 310 region of West Los Angeles was the first in the state to
get 11-digit dialing, and it has not gone smoothly. Customers had
trouble getting through to some numbers, some security systems do
not work with the overlay and people have been confused by the
change.
</P>
<P>
   Residents have flooded the PUC with complaints, and several
state legislators proposed a bill to end 11-digit dialing.
Customers in 310 began dialing 11 digits in April, and a new area
code, 424, was supposed to go into effect in July. However, the PUC
temporarily suspended implementation of 424.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the commissioners said yesterday that the overlay is
creating a hardship for customers and should be scrapped. Only one
other major city, Houston, has rescinded an overlay after it took
effect.
</P>
<P>
   But the changes will not happen quickly. The 310 area should
revert back to seven-digit dialing in about 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, the PUC will collect data from phone
companies to determine how many numbers are available in existing
area codes and will solicit bids from companies that want to assign
phone numbers in blocks of 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take some months,'' Mickiewicz said. ``It
depends on a number of factors, including how cooperative the
(telecommunications) industry is. If the industry decides to fight
us at every turn, it's going to slow things down a lot. Hopefully,
we can get cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   John Britton, a spokesman for Pacific Bell, said the company is
willing to work with the PUC and to provide the data it requested.
PUC President Richard Bilas said he has been told by others in the
industry that they plan to cooperate as well.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioners Bilas, Hyatt and Carl Wood voted for the plan to
rescind the overlay, while Josiah Neeper and Henry Duque voted
against the plan. Duque, who plans to write a dissenting opinion,
said he wanted more time to study the FCC decision before halting
the overlay.

 &HT;    Attorneys fail in bid to have judge removed from role in
Davidian lawsuit
 &HT;    By Tommy Witherspoon and Mark England
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Attorneys for some relatives of Branch Davidians
killed in the fire at Mount Carmel have failed in a second attempt
to have U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. removed from
presiding over their civil lawsuit against the government.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans rejected a
petition filed by attorneys for David Koresh's grandmother to have
Smith removed from the case and from attorneys for 44 plaintiffs
who were thrown out of the case by a July 1 ruling by Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The federal appellate court also denied a request from the
ousted plaintiffs to be reinstated in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The petition for writ of mandamus, which asked the higher court
to remove Smith from the case, claimed that because Smith had not
issued a ruling on the plaintiffs' request to postpone the trial,
which was scheduled at that time for Oct. 18, it showed he was
biased against the Branch Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   Smith ruled Wednesday that the trial will be postponed to
accommodate the transfer of evidence from governmental entities to
the clerk of his court. He did not set another trial date.
</P>
<P>
   A motion to have Smith recused that was filed by all plaintiffs
in the massive wrongful-death lawsuit two years ago also was
rejected. Not all plaintiffs' attorneys joined in the most recent
motion, which was filed two weeks ago with the 5th Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the judge cannot sit as a fair and impartial
juror in the factual part of the wrongful-death case,'' said
Houston attorney Jim Brannon, who represents Jean Holub, Koresh's
grandmother. ``He has already made up his mind on key issues and I
think this ruling reflects that. With all the stuff that is coming
out now, we believe he made up his mind on tainted evidence. The
FBI evidence is just wholly not credible.''
</P>
<P>
   New York attorney Ramsey Clark, who asked that his clients be
restored as plaintiffs in the case, did not return phone messages
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 5th Circuit ruling was filed on Sept. 10, but a copy of the
ruling was not filed in Smith's court in Waco until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Houston attorney Mike Caddell, who represents about 90 percent
of the plaintiffs remaining in the lawsuit, said he declined to
join Brannon and Clark in seeking Smith's removal again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel just the opposite to some extent,'' Caddell said. ``I
think what Judge Smith has done over the last few months is
demonstrate his desire to be fair to both sides in the civil trial,
his desire to have the evidence made available and his desire to
get at the truth about what happened at Mount Carmel six years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said he had concerns about the judge presiding over the
civil case because Smith was judge at the 1994 criminal trial of 11
Branch Davidians charged with killing four Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms agents during a gunfight Feb. 28, 1993, when
agents arrived to arrest Koresh on weapons charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be difficult for him or anyone to divorce what was
learned and what happened in the criminal trial from what the
evidence will be in the civil case,'' Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   In his July 1 ruling, Smith granted a majority of the
government's motions to dismiss elements of the lawsuit and a
number of plaintiffs. However, he said the issues of whether the
ATF used excessive force during the raid that started the 51-day
siege at Mount Carmel and whether the FBI used excessive force
during the tear gas assault that ended it must be decided at trial.
</P>
<P>
   Smith dismissed all but one of the individual defendants,
including U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno and former Texas Gov.
Ann Richards. FBI assistant special agent in charge Lon T. Horiuchi
remains as the lone individual defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Smith based his ruling on Horiuchi on the statements of an FBI
agent who said he heard gunshots coming from a sniper position
manned by Horiuchi on the day of the fire.

ALBRIGHT WARNS THE RUSSIANS TO BATTLE CORRUPTION, OR ELSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Thursday
criticized Russia's leaders for failing to combat corruption, but
defended the Clinton administration's policy of supporting aid to
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made clear that we will not support further
multilateral assistance to Russia unless fully adequate safeguards
are in place,'' Albright said, in some of the administration's
sharpest remarks since an international investigation of money
laundering allegations surfaced last month. ``And we have always
kept a close eye on our bilateral aid.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright tried to deflect pointed criticism in Congress that the
administration had ignored signs of corruption in the Russian
government, but she probably did little to calm the criticism
because for the time being she stopped short of threatening to
withdraw U.S. support for loans to Moscow from the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has already received $640 million of a $4.5-billion loan
from the fund, and a senior fund official said on Thursday that a
second installment of roughly the same size was expected to be
approved soon without American objection.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in the House and Senate have scheduled a series of
hearings beginning next week on the question of Russian corruption
and the administration's response to it.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said senior officials had repeatedly called on
President Boris Yeltsin and his aides to strengthen safeguards
against money laundering, bribery and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the response has not been adequate,'' Albright
said in a wide-ranging speech at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Yeltsin's government needs at last to make fighting
corruption a priority,'' she added. ``The Russian legal system
remains no match for well-connected criminals, and the tentacles of
Russian organized crime have spread far beyond the nation's
borders.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration's strongest critics have used the allegations
of corruption, some of them directed to the Kremlin itself, to
excoriate President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, who has
been an influential voice on Russian policy.
</P>
<P>
   The furor has made it clear that the Republicans intend to make
it a campaign issue in 2000. On Tuesday, the House majority leader,
Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, called the administration's Russian
policy ``the great U.S. foreign policy failure since Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in the United States, Britain and Switzerland are
investigating the movement of at least $4.2 billion from Russia
through the Bank of New York, suspecting that some of the money
came from Russians involved in organized crime, corporate
embezzlement, tax evasion or political graft. Because of the
amounts involved, there is a review into the use of international
aid, most of which comes from the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said that corruption had become a ``dead weight'' that
was holding back Russia's transition into a free, democratic
society.
</P>
<P>
   Although she declined to answer any questions about the extent
of the corruption, she said the administration would be ``outraged
if some of these allegations are true.''
</P>
<P>
   She welcomed the decision by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin to
send a team of investigators to Washington to meet with Justice
Department officials involved in the investigation, and she urged
Russia to cooperate with the investigation ``no matter where or to
whom the evidence leads.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said Russia needed to do more: enact tough laws against
money laundering, revise its financial system to ensure
accountability, and establish standards to prevent conflicts of
interests among government officials, virtually nonexistent today.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said the two goals of U.S. policy _ ever since
President George Bush's administration _ have been to promote
security through arms control and nonproliferation and to support
Russia's emerging democratic, social and political institutions.
``These are reasons to increase our efforts with Russia, not, as
some suggest, to cut our aid and walk away,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed increasing assistance to Russia in the
coming fiscal year to $1 billion, from $847 million this year. Most
of the increase would go to expanding a program to dismantle or
safeguard Russia's nuclear and other weapons programs. The House
has proposed reducing that to $725 million, the Senate to $780
million.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have also used the investigation to renew
attacks on the IMF, although there is no evidence any IMF loans
were diverted. A senior fund official said on Thursday that the
organization was still seeking some assurances that the money it
lent Russia had not been misused, but suggested that the fund was
likely to continue lending money to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is a program that works,'' the official said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.

 Wine Grape Harvest Has Distinct Dichotomy
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Peter Sinton &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
If you had to but a label on this year's wine grape harvest, a good
choice might be dichotomy.
</P>
<P>
   Cabernet Sauvignon and other favored grapes in coastal counties
remain in fairly tight supply and their prices remain firm as
demand stays strong for pricey premium wines.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a glut of wine grapes exists in the southern
portion of California's Central Valley. There, prices have dropped
up to 45 percent from last year. As a result, consumers should see
some big bargains in the $3-to-$7-per-bottle category.
</P>
<P>
   That was the assessment of grape growers and winery owners who
attended the annual Wine Industry Symposium at the Silverado Resort
in Napa yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   After an unseasonally cool summer, the wine grape harvest began
in late August, about the same as last year. And like the 1998
crop, which was hurt by spring rains, one would expect overall
tonnage to fall below the record 2.9 million tons harvested in
1997. But it actually will be up because of new plantings.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, about 40,000 acres of recently planted vineyards in
California start bearing fruit. That's close to 10 percent of the
state's 385,000 acres of land devoted to grape production.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is a glut of grapes in the Central Valley,
especially from Madera County south, because many farmers are
switching to high-end grapes from other crops such as cotton and
table grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters even worse, each acre of hot Central Valley
vineyard land might produce two to three times the 5 tons produced
on one acre along the North Coast.
</P>
<P>
   New watered-down wine products also are contributing to the
Central Valley's wine woes, according to Allied Grape Growers
President Barry Bedwell and others.
</P>
<P>
   Canandaigua, a wine producer, pioneered the 5-liter bag-in-box
Chardonnay, Merlot and other wines ``with natural flavors'' and
E.&AMP;J. Gallo and the Wine Group followed suit. The actual percentage
of wine in these products is not disclosed, but Bedwell said it
ranges from 65 percent to less than 10 percent. Both of these
products could be drawing consumers away from products made
entirely from grapes.
</P>
<P>
   A new generation of flavored wine coolers in 750-milliliter
bottles with names such as Blackberry Merlot, Strawberry Zinfandel
and Wild Vines also could be hurting wine sales.
</P>
<P>
   On top of all this, there is a surplus of wines _ from Australia
to Chile to Southern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of all these factors, grape prices in the lower
Central Valley have been crushed. Cabernet Sauvignon, which sold
for $650 to $1,000 a ton a year ago, now fetches $400 to $600.
Chardonnay that went for $500 to $800 a ton is down to $350 to
$500.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that big producers like Gallo and Canandaigua
have been cutting the prices they pay for grapes by about 30
percent,'' said David Freed, Chairman of UCC Group, which owns both
coastal and Central Valley vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   When farmers ask him about what variety to plant, Allied Grape
Growers' Bedwell said he is starting to respond, ``Pumpkins.''
</P>
<P>
   Bulk Wine broker Joe Ciatti labeled the Central Valley market
``depressed'' but called Napa, Sonoma and other coastal counties
``a different world.'' While overall California wine shipments were
flat through the first six months of this year compared to the same
period last year, sales of premium wines were up 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As an indication of higher demand for greater grapes, Cabernet
Sauvignon grapes from Napa are now fetching about $2,450 a ton
compared with $2,200 a year ago. But not all prices are up.
Chardonnay has slipped from around $1,850 a ton to about $1,650.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who like cheaper wines should benefit from the current
market conditions. ``We haven't seen a decline in prices from
coastal producers,'' said wine industry consultant Eileen
Fredrikson of Gomberg Fredrikson &AMP; Associates. ``But there are some
wonderful buys in the $3-to-$7 wine category. Some prices have come
down about 15 percent in the past year.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the long term, the wine industry, which is facing a wine
glut, is anxious to get Americans to change their wine perceptions
and drinking habits.
</P>
<P>
   The average American adult drinks 2.38 gallons of wine a year,
which is up from 1.96 gallons in 1991 but down from 2.58 gallons
way back in 1982. In France and Italy, adults drink about eight
times as much wine. Moreover, only a sliver of the U.S. population
drinks wine. According to industry data, 11 percent of American
adults drink 88 percent of the wine, and 18 percent consume the
other 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In recent test marketing in Albany, N.Y., and Austin, Texas, the
Wine Market Council spent $1.2 million on ads to see if Americans
could be persuaded to abandon the generally held belief that wine
is for special occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Council President John Gillespie said that the ``Wine. What are
you saving it for?'' campaign helped boost wine sales in those two
markets by about 2.3 percent. That may not sound like a lot, but it
matches the total growth in U.S. wine consumption last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Wine Market Council hopes to spend about $4 million on a
national wine promotion next year. But some critics question how
effective such a campaign might be.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing an analogy to the toothpaste market, Stimson Lane
Vineyards &AMP; Estates President Allen Shoup said, ``You might be able
to get people to shift from Crest to Colgate (with advertising),
but I'm not sure you'll get them to brush their teeth more often.''

<P>
   Almost as tragic as the nearly 280 deaths in five bombings in
Russia in less than three weeks is the mixture of fear,
defenselessness, frustration and cynicism with which most Russians
have reacted to them.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin has said all the right words. It is
certainly true, as he said after the second blast in Moscow, that
`` this enemy does not have a conscience, shows no sorrow and is
without honor. It has no face ... no nationality or belief. ...
Federal and regional bodies should work (to capture the
perpetrators) as a united body.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also quite true that, as he said, citizens must stay calm;
law enforcement should prevail.
</P>
<P>
   But why is it that so many people are ready to believe that the
highest Russian authorities had a hand in, or at least may benefit
from, the explosions?
</P>
<P>
   Wild accusations and conspiracy theories that appeal to the
man-in-the-street are being uttered all over the country _ that the
West is somehow to blame, that all people from the Caucuses are
suspect and should be deported from Moscow, that politicians are
behind the terror so elections can be put off, that Moscow should
bomb Chechnya! Now these absurdities are also being repeated by
some members of the Russian parliament. Other politicians and some
journalists are playing the blame game too.
</P>
<P>
   This is exactly the wrong way to react to a campaign of terror.
The fear felt today by many Russians, in Moscow and in the
heartland, is tragically being intensified by the lack of
leadership. Frustration is almost a permanent state of mind for
many Russians, but popular cynicism toward the entire political
establishment is seeping into the general panic at the horrible
blasts.
</P>
<P>
   Is anyone on the Russian political scene capable of instilling
faith and providing the powerful leadership so desperately needed
now?
</P>
<P>
   Yuri Luzhkov, the mayor of Moscow, was the first to call the
explosions a terrorist act and to point to the ``Chechen
connection.'' Leaders of the Islamic insurgency in Chechnya, who
weeks ago crossed into the southern province of Dagestan to wage
war, were exacting revenge, he said. But was it a good idea to do
so while police and Federal Security Service experts and
investigators were still probing the evidence?
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov's position is ambiguous. He has called the terrorists
``beasts'' and said they all ``need to be shot.'' He has been
criticized for statements that smack of racial intolerance, while
others are accusing him of allowing ``men from the Caucasus'' _
i.e., gangsters _ to control businesses in Moscow. Such accusations
turn the misgivings back on him.
</P>
<P>
   How about the president? Frankly, few people expect that Yeltsin
can provide the badly needed leadership. Over the past few years he
has failed the test on practically all the issues now challenging
Russia. His self-serving, abrupt game of reshuffling prime
ministers and Cabinet members has given Russia the heightened look
of an unpredictable and vulnerable place.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Lebed? This former paratroop general, who became
governor of the Siberian region of Krasnoyarsk, has a reputation
for being a strong law-and-order man. Yet he was sinking into
oblivion. Now, in an atmosphere of deepening crisis, Lebed's name

<P>
   Almost as tragic as the nearly 280 deaths in five bombings in
Russia in less than three weeks is the mixture of fear,
defenselessness, frustration and cynicism with which most Russians
have reacted to them.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin has said all the right words. It is
certainly true, as he said after the second blast in Moscow, that
`` this enemy does not have a conscience, shows no sorrow and is
without honor. It has no face ... no nationality or belief. ...
Federal and regional bodies should work (to capture the
perpetrators) as a united body.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also quite true that, as he said, citizens must stay calm;
law enforcement should prevail.
</P>
<P>
   But why is it that so many people are ready to believe that the
highest Russian authorities had a hand in, or at least may benefit
from, the explosions?
</P>
<P>
   Wild accusations and conspiracy theories that appeal to the
man-in-the-street are being uttered all over the country _ that the
West is somehow to blame, that all people from the Caucuses are
suspect and should be deported from Moscow, that politicians are
behind the terror so elections can be put off, that Moscow should
bomb Chechnya! Now these absurdities are also being repeated by
some members of the Russian parliament. Other politicians and some
journalists are playing the blame game too.
</P>
<P>
   This is exactly the wrong way to react to a campaign of terror.
The fear felt today by many Russians, in Moscow and in the
heartland, is tragically being intensified by the lack of
leadership. Frustration is almost a permanent state of mind for
many Russians, but popular cynicism toward the entire political
establishment is seeping into the general panic at the horrible
blasts.
</P>
<P>
   Is anyone on the Russian political scene capable of instilling
faith and providing the powerful leadership so desperately needed
now?
</P>
<P>
   Yuri Luzhkov, the mayor of Moscow, was the first to call the
explosions a terrorist act and to point to the ``Chechen
connection.'' Leaders of the Islamic insurgency in Chechnya, who
weeks ago crossed into the southern province of Dagestan to wage
war, were exacting revenge, he said. But was it a good idea to do
so while police and Federal Security Service experts and
investigators were still probing the evidence?
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov's position is ambiguous. He has called the terrorists
``beasts'' and said they all ``need to be shot.'' He has been
criticized for statements that smack of racial intolerance, while
others are accusing him of allowing ``men from the Caucasus'' _
i.e., gangsters _ to control businesses in Moscow. Such accusations
turn the misgivings back on him.
</P>
<P>
   How about the president? Frankly, few people expect that Yeltsin
can provide the badly needed leadership. Over the past few years he
has failed the test on practically all the issues now challenging
Russia. His self-serving, abrupt game of reshuffling prime
ministers and Cabinet members has given Russia the heightened look
of an unpredictable and vulnerable place.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Lebed? This former paratroop general, who became
governor of the Siberian region of Krasnoyarsk, has a reputation
for being a strong law-and-order man. Yet he was sinking into
oblivion. Now, in an atmosphere of deepening crisis, Lebed's name
has, not surprisingly, come up again. So far, his reaction has
amounted to cryptic remarks and gestures that are at best confusing
and could well seal his political decline.
</P>
<P>

NEW GAINS CITED IN CANCER THERAPY, BUT SOME RESEARCHERS HAVE
QUESTIONS  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Ill.)  (mk) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Judah Folkman, the Harvard researcher who has pioneered the
idea of starving tumors with factors that cut off their blood
supply, will announce Friday that he has discovered a third such
agent. But the report comes at a time when the first two factors he
identified, known as angiostatin and endostatin, have encountered
setbacks and prominent scientists have begun to criticize publicly
the quality of the work done in his laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   An official at the National Cancer Institute, which set out
independently to reproduce Folkman's work on endostatin, said in an
interview this week that the agency was making no new efforts to do
so. Its scientists have replicated Folkman's results while working
in his laboratory, but have failed to get the same results in their
own. Folkman, who works at Children's Hospital in Boston and at
Harvard Medical School, says the reason is that the endostatin
samples he sent were damaged by the dry ice in which they were
packed.
</P>
<P>
   Also this week, a scientist who worked at Bristol Myers Squibb
to bring angiostatin to market, provided new details about the
extensive efforts the company made to validate Folkman's results
and the scientific roadblocks that led them to drop the project.
</P>
<P>
   Another senior critic suggested that the substances isolated in
Folkman's laboratory could be artifacts resulting from erroneous
laboratory procedure and not true tumor-starving factors. He also
criticized the National Cancer Institute for its plan to test
endostatin in patients without first obtaining credible evidence of
its efficacy.
</P>
<P>
   These may well be minor glitches in the still promising field of
angiogenesis, the name for the body's process of generating small
blood vessels. Tumors must induce the body to form a blood supply
to them. Through many years of pioneering research, Folkman
discovered that tumors produce substances that induce angiogenesis,
and, more surprisingly, substances that suppress the process.
Because blood vessel cells, unlike tumor cells, cannot develop
resistance to drugs, they offer in principle a far better target
for anti-cancer therapy. Folkman reported in 1997 that in tests in
his laboratory, endostatin had caused tumors in mice to regress to
microscopic size, a spectacular result.
</P>
<P>
   The new anti-tumor factor Folkman has described in Friday's
issue of Science is a fragment of anti-thrombin, one of the many
proteins involved in the blood clotting systems. The fragment is
potent in reducing blood vessel formation and in shrinking tumors,
he and colleagues state in their article.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to follow up Folkman's work on the first two
angiogenesis inhibitors, some researchers have succeeded and others
have not. Dr. Gerald Soff of Northwestern University Medical School
has made his own angiostatin, independently of Folkman. Dr. Noel
Bouck, also at Northwestern, said she had tested it side by side
with angiostatin made by Dr. Michael O'Reilly, the leading
angiogenesis researcher in Folkman's laboratory. Both substances
were highly active at very small doses, Dr. Bouck said, although
she tested it mostly on cultures of cells and not on tumors in
animals.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers testing endostatin have met with a similar spectrum
of success. ``There is a great deal of variability,'' said Dr.
Edward Sausville, the National Cancer Institute official
responsible for overseeing tests of endostatin. ``Some get results
and others, which are not published, did not get activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Folkman's response to the mixed success of other groups in
repeating his results is to note the extreme difficulty of the
experiments that O'Reilly and others carried out under his
supervision. ``Each of our papers takes about four years of work,
so you have a long learning curve,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other laboratories may have had trouble repeating his work
because of the many exacting small points of experimental detail
that must be mastered. Even so, ``Five laboratories have made their
own endostatin and published their finding of anti-tumor
activity,'' Folkman said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Cancer Institute has not tried to make its own
endostatin ``because it's not our position to make things that
might undermine other manufacturers,'' Sausville said. It has also
not tried to select the most effective of the endostatins made by
other laboratories because a ``national bake-off of the best
endostatin preparation would get very complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the public interest surrounding Folkman's work, much
of it publicity that Folkman did not seek, the institute seems
interested in testing only the endostatin prepared by Folkman's lab
and by EntreMed, the small biotechnology company that has licensed
the product. Despite having been unable to repeat Folkman's animal
results independently, the agency is proceeding with tests in
humans, a procedure whose ethical basis was questioned in an
article this week in The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. George Yancopoulos, an angiogenesis expert who is the chief
scientific officer at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals in Tarrytown, N.Y.,
has now come forward with his own criticism of the agency and of
Folkman's work. Although an academic and commercial competitor of
Folkman, Yancopoulos is also one of the most highly cited
biologists in the scientific literature. In an interview, he said
of the NCI, ``Subjecting patients to unknown risk and providing
illusionary or false hope in the absence of credible evidence for
potential benefit certainly raises ethical issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Sausville said that agency's rationale is that both Folkman and
EntreMed have now tested the human version of endostatin and shown
it has some efficacy against mouse tumors. (Previous tests used the
mouse version of endostatin.) Also, Sausville said, human
endostatin is ``completely and utterly safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Animal tests often do not accurately predict how well a drug
will perform in humans, and the Food and Drug Administration does
not require proof of a drug's efficacy in animals before going to
human trials. Given the safety of endostatin, it will be quickest
to test endostatin in people rather than try to clarify the
questions in animals, Sausville said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In pursuing this policy, the National Cancer Institute is
leapfrogging the obstacle at which Bristol-Myers Squibb fell, that
of successfully repeating the animal tests. Although the company
said at the time that it was dropping angiostatin because it
doubted it could produce enough, Dr. Mariano Barbacid, then the
company's vice president for oncology drug discovery and the
official responsible for developing angiostatin, said in an e-mail
Thursday: ``We could never reproduce the results published by
Folkman in vivo,'' meaning in animals, when using either O'Reilly's
preparation or angiostatin produced by EntreMed.
</P>
<P>
   Even then the company did not give up its efforts, Barbacid
said. Another of its laboratories prepared angiostatin in three
different ways, but ``to the best of my recollection, none of these
preparations had any biological activity'' in the standard mouse
tumor test, said Barbacid, who is now director of the Spanish
National Cancer Center in Madrid, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Barbacid then decided to make angiostatin in his own laboratory
at Bristol Myers and asked Folkman's laboratory for a virus
containing the angiostatin gene. ``To our surprise, this construct
did not yield the expected size products,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that the angiostatin gene contained a grave
production flaw _ a genetic error known as a stop codon that halted
production of angiostatin before it was complete.
</P>
<P>
   But Barbacid noted that the virus method of making angiostatin
``was not the system of choice for the production of the
angiostatin molecules used in Folkman's publications.'' Folkman
said the virus did make a shorter version of angiostatin but that
it was effective too.
</P>
<P>
   A sharp disagreement has broken out over the nature of the
substances Folkman has isolated. All are fragments of larger, well
known proteins. Folkman believes the fragments become
anti-angiogenic after being cleaved in the body from their parent
proteins. But another leading angiogenesis researcher believes
Folkman's co-workers have made a common laboratory error, that of
isolating abundant protein fragments and erroneously attributing
some activity to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the first things you isolate as contaminants,''
Yancopoulos said. ``You work through them and get to the much less
abundant proteins that are really contributing to an activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are trained to be skeptical of their own and each
other's work, and Barbacid, in light of his experience of
angiostatin, has reservations about some of the results from
Folkman's laboratory. He said Folkman had given him little help in
trying to reproduce the angiostatin work. ``It was a very bizarre
situation, very frustrating to have a molecule that supposedly was
doing these marvelous things and not being able to get help from
the person who discovered it,'' Barbacid said.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman said it was totally inaccurate to say he had not been
helpful to Barbacid.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific progress rarely proceeds in a straight line and it
seems too early to tell whether, within the general promise of the
field, Folkman's particular factors are at a temporary roadblock or
some more serious obstacle.

IS TYSON MATURING? SLOWLY, MAYBE
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Mike Tyson, four months out of prison and preparing
for his comeback fight against Orlin Norris here on Oct. 23,
spreads around the blame for his troubles. Among the culprits: the
justice system, the media, his colleagues _ himself.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the former heavyweight champion remains bitter.
</P>
<P>
   He criticized the courts, claiming he has never been treated
fairly. He landed a jab on the chin of the media, referring to
sportswriters at a news conference on Thursday as ``dysfunctional
alcoholic reporters.'' And he said the fact he lives under a
microscope has distorted reality.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, in a reflective moment with a few of those
dysfunctional reporters, he looked inward to explain two prison
sentences, his suspension from boxing for biting the ear of Evander
Holyfield and other setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reflect on my life,'' he said. ``I'm only 33, so young, but
I seem so old. I've seen so many things. All the crap, how did it
come upon me?
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad influences ... and I wasn't mature enough to understand
it. My problems came from my immaturity, I wasn't mature enough to
handle it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I grew up too fast. All the drama hit me and I wasn't
ready for it. So I went cold, I shut off my emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   And now? Has he turned the emotions back on? Has he gained any
maturity?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``It's one step at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that could be construed as hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   One involves his grade-school-age children, who live with their
mother in Maryland while he lives and trains in Las Vegas. They
watch TV, he said. Their friends watch TV and then make comments.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to behave in front of this audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one thing that's different now,'' he said. ``The other
kids talk to my kids so I'm real careful what I say. I definitely
don't want to use foul language.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens, Tyson wants to make something clear:
He's a human being.
</P>
<P>
   He insists he's not much different from the rest of us. It's
just that everything he says and does comes under tremendous
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm under a microscope,'' he said. ``In this room, and I'm not
saying just reporters, there might be perverts, pedofile, freaks,
horrible fathers. We all have issues we're dealing with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides me being worldwide, I'm not as bad as some people. I
have some decency, some morals.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson could remain under that microscope for some time.
</P>
<P>
   His fight with Norris, a former cruiserweight champion about
Tyson's size, will mark the start of his third comeback.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, more than ever, he seems to be in it for the
money: He remains millions of dollars in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately he hopes he'll once again fight for the world
championship he has twice lost _ and reap the ungodly financial
rewards that come with it. However, for now, he's not inclined to
focus beyond Norris.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't fought since he knocked out Francois Botha in January
because he was convicted of assault and spent three months in
prison, where he ballooned to 280 pounds. Now, after months of
training, he's trimmed down to about 235 but has a lot of work
ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to work to get into shape to fight the top
contenders,'' he said. Again, one step at a time.

 WILMINGTON, N.C.: South Carolina. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The old buildings of downtown Charleston shrugged off lashing
wind and rain, as many have there for two centuries. ``These old
houses have seen a lot worse,'' said Park Smith, wielding a saw to
create fresh firewood from a fallen tree near South Battery Street.
</P>
<P>
   Charleston suffered little more than $10 million in damage,
according to the county director of building services, Carl
Simmons. ``Very, very minor,'' he declared. Other residents said
Floyd would be remembered for the convoys of rain-slickered
television anchormen who hit the beaches more than for the actual
glancing blow the storm delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Down the coast in Myrtle Beach, S.C., wind damage was minimal
but flooding was severe along the coastal Grand Strand. Safety
workers had to deal with snakes fleeing to dry ground and drivers
determined to ford passages left obviously risky with coursing
flood water. National Guardsmen audibly cursed one driver who
ventured blithely ever deeper into a flooded crossing in his pickup
truck. Suddenly, the driver, his wife and daughter had to be
rescued when the truck was swept away.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he made the attempt, the driver, Ralph Elem,
personified the sense of happy adventure that seemed part of the
local post-hurricane mood. ``For the heck of it,'' Elem replied.
``Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   The main effect here from Floyd was a relentless 34-hour record
rainfall of 19.06 inches that spilled beyond drainage ditches,
flooded houses and blocked major crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen water like this,'' said Donald Squires as he
paddled in a rowboat down the road to his house, which he found
sitting high and mostly dry in outlying Delco. ``This sure ain't
another Hazel, not the way my father always talked,'' he said of
the 1954 hurricane that set this city's benchmark for death and
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   As he roamed in the sunlight that followed the storm, Fire Chief
Studt was openly grateful that Floyd never lived up to the advance
billing. ''But, hey, we got another one coming next week,'' he
quickly added, his eye out for an evolving storm called Gert.

   All were united in their love of God, and all took time to pray,

<P>
   KRISTI BECKEL
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of death, life.
</P>
<P>
   The family of Kristi Beckel has decided to use the loss of their
daughter to help save others desperately awaiting an organ
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the Fort Worth family made the painful decision to
take Kristi off life support and have her organs and tissue
harvested, said Ron Ehrle, managing director for LifeGift Organ
Donation Center in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our thoughts and prayers are with all the families affected by
this tragedy,'' Ehrle said. ``We hope that Kristi Beckel's family
decision to donate her organs and tissue will provide some comfort
in the months and years ahead. We are truly grateful for this
family's unselfish act to save lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristi, 14, died shortly after midnight Thursday at John Peter
Smith Hospital. She had been shot in the head during the killing
spree.
</P>
<P>
   No one in her family could be reached for comment. Neighbors
declined to talk about Beckel or the crime.
</P>
<P>
   LifeGift representatives and John Peter Smith officials met with
the Beckel family to discuss the organs and tissue donation.
</P>
<P>
   The family told LifeGift members that they want the girl's
organs donated so other lives may live. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SHAWN BROWN
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Brown was a man on a mission.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old student at Southwestern Baptist Theological
Seminary was pursuing a master's degree in educational ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very responsible, very attentive person, and he had a
particular heart for today's youth and in helping them,'' said Mary
Ellen Edwards, an advanced clinical practictioner at New Horizons,
a mental health facility that provides support to people suffering
severe grief and loss and other mental health issues.
</P>
<P>
   Brown worked part-time at New Horizons _ ``sometimes that meant
40 hours a week,'' Edwards said _ to support his education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have an overwhelming, incredible sadness and loss,''
said Edwards, his supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   As a mental health program assistant, Brown often transported
clients to and from group sessions, helped them with personal
hygiene and generally facilitated their stay at the center.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and his wife, Kathy Jo, had been married about two years
and had no children. Edwards said Kathy Jo Brown requested privacy
and did not want to comment on the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children who died at Columbine now have a wonderful youth
minister in heaven,'' said Becky Roland, a friend and neighbor of
the Browns. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SYDNEY BROWNING
</P>
<P>
   Sydney Browning was ``one of those people who had boundless
energy and enthusiasm and this cutting edge humor,'' said Renee
Karriem, the principal at the school where Browning taught. ``I
just feel blessed to have her in my life. We loved her.''
</P>
<P>
   Browning taught at Success High School, a night school on the
Trimble Tech campus. Thursday, students and faculty members wore
black lapel ribbons to mourn her.
</P>
<P>
   Browning, 36, was single and the children's choir director at
Wedgwood Baptist Church. She loved youngsters, her colleagues said.
She was involved in the lives of her students, many of whom were
high school dropouts, and always encouraged their success.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the kind of teacher who greeted every child,'' Karriem
said. ``She'd go to the ends of the Earth to help them make it. She
was the kind of teacher who liked to send `good news' notes home.''
</P>
<P>
   Browning had been a teacher for the Fort Worth school district
for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Principal Sheryl Hopper was near tears as she
reminisced about Browning, who she said made Christian music
recordings and sang at weddings and funerals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all going to miss her'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Browning had a master's degree from Southwestern Baptist
Theological Seminary and was close to her family in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   One of Browning's students, Joe Alex Pulido , 19, said that he
and fellow students are in shock at losing their teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was humble, I guess. Outgoing and funny,'' he said. ``It's
still kind of hard to believe she's gone.'' &QL;

CHINA'S INTERNET PROVIDERS REMAIN BOWED, NOT BROKEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In private they are puzzled and angry, but in public,
China's fledgling Internet companies have pasted on brave faces the
last two days, ever since an important government minister said
that foreign shares in companies providing Internet content or
services were illegal.
</P>
<P>
   No one quite believes that Wu Jichuan, the minister of
information industries, intends to force dissolution of the dozens
of young, frontier companies that have attracted foreign funds from
giants like Intel as well as from individuals and venture capital
groups. Many of these companies also hope to make public stock
offerings in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign ownership has never been allowed in Internet service
providers, which connect users with the state-run gateways to the
global Internet. But on the assumption that fortunes will follow
the exponential growth of computer use here, tens of millions of
dollars in outside money has rushed to companies developing
Chinese-language electronic commerce and portals, or Web sites like
Yahoo.com and Excite.com that serve as the front doors for users'
Internet journeys. By government estimates, widely considered to be
low, China had more than 4 million Internet users as of June, with
the numbers rising fast.
</P>
<P>
   Among the best known portals here are SINA.com and Sohu.com, and
both have substantial foreign investment. Another pioneer, Sparkice
I-Com, which runs Internet Cafis, an Internet access provider, has
outside investors, too.
</P>
<P>
   The players in this risky field say they have cooperated with
government agencies to get where they are and profess surprise at
what appears to be a sudden turn. Most of the affected companies
said that the supposed ban on investment surely would not stick
and, indeed, one ministry official hinted Thursday that the rules
might be eased in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Zhang, the president of Sohu.com, which has investments
from Intel, Dow Jones and other foreign companies as well as three
professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said
Thursday that in building his company over the last three years he
has worked closely with several government agencies, including the
Information Industries Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang declined to comment directly on the minister's remarks,
only saying, ``I think that venture-capital investment to develop
high-tech industries is the path China is taking.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhang held a previously scheduled news conference in Beijing on
Thursday to announce his company's entry into e-commerce, a genuine
frontier in a country where credit and debit cards are only
starting to catch on. Appearing with him were officials of Intel
China, which has provided capital for the project as well as the
computer chips; Microsoft China, which provides the software, and
Compaq Computer, which provides the hardware. But the sudden
questions about legality hung over the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Intel China president James Jarrett said
his company had invested in several Chinese Internet companies. He
said he felt that, in the end, officials would realize that such
investments contributed to China's progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Left unclarified,'' Jarrett said of the minister's statement,
``this clearly would have a dampening effect on foreign investment
in these sectors.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of other investing companies went further in
private, saying that a ban on foreign investment would be
self-defeating for China because it would drive the same capital
and energy to places like Taiwan and Hong Kong _ where companies
could serve Chinese consumers from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Dow Jones Newswires on Thursday, an
official of the Information Industries Ministry restated that
outside investments in Internet companies were illegal. The
ministry's position is that Internet content and services are
covered by rules barring foreign ownership of telecommunications
services _ rules that were written in 1993 and 1995, before the
Internet was widely available in China.
</P>
<P>
   But the official, Wang Lijian, vice director of the ministry's
news office, also said that the telecommunications rules would be
revised later this year in a manner ``beneficial for investment and
development.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign entry into telecommunications services has been a prime
topic in the Chinese-U.S. negotiations over China's entry to the
World Trade Organization. If those talks succeed, then outside
investments in computer services are likely to be legalized in any
case.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese and foreign businessmen here are speculating about Wu's
reasons for raising the issue, which he first did in an interview
Tuesday with the Financial Times. Some think it is a ploy to warn
the United States what could happen if China is denied entry to the
World Trade Organization. Others think it is part of Wu's effort to
solidify the powers of his recently formed super-ministry over the
growing Internet sector.

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush cut short a busy
presidential campaign swing through Michigan and beat a hasty,
somber path back to Texas on Thursday, expressing outrage at what
he called ``a wave of evil passing through America'' but asserting
that gun control was not the solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I knew the law to make people love one another,'' Bush
said Thursday afternoon as he left a hospital here, where he had
met with some of the people who had been injured Wednesday when a
gunman opened fire at a prayer service, killing seven of the
churchgoers and himself.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush, the front-runner for the Republican presidential
nomination, reached out to the grieving, he was entering and
navigating delicate political straits.
</P>
<P>
   The church shootings joined other incidents of horrific gun
violence this year that have created new pressure for additional
restrictions on firearms. But Bush has not been a strong advocate
for gun control, and if he wins the Republican nomination, his
Democratic opponent is sure to shine a spotlight on that fact.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Michigan on Thursday, Bush made clear that he
retained the belief that the primary explanation for gun violence
was in people's hearts, not in the number and nature of firearms
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of a law _ a governmental law _ that will put
love in people's hearts,'' Bush said at a news conference in Grand
Rapids, Mich. ``There seems to be a wave of evil passing through
America now, and we as a society can pass laws and hold people
accountable for the decisions they make, but our hopes and prayers
have got to be that there is more love in society.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the shooter, Bush said, ``I'd like to make sure
people like him don't have guns.'' But he added that the man
``obviously was acting as a result of evil in his heart'' and that
Americans should ``pray for love in people's hearts.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bush clearly understands the potency of gun control as an issue
in the 2000 elections. His stump speech includes a section on gun
control. But what he says in that section is that gun laws must be
more vigorously and consistently enforced, and that people who
sell, obtain or use guns illegally must pay a harsh price. He does
not call for new laws.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has signaled his approval of some of the modest new gun
control measures that enjoy bipartisan support in Congress, like a
ban on the import of high-capacity ammunition clips. He has even
said he favors raising the age for the legal purchase of a handgun
to 21 from 18, which is not among the restrictions being considered
by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But Bob Walker, president of Handgun Control, an advocacy group
in Washington, said that the moderation he had been hearing lately
in Bush's voice was less convincing than his record as governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When push comes to shove, Bush has always been on the side of
the gun lobby,'' Walker said in a telephone interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Walker drew attention to two of Bush's decisions. In 1995,
shortly after he took office, Bush signed into law a measure
permitting Texans to carry concealed guns, providing the gun owner
first received proper training and certification.
</P>
<P>
   Scott McClellan, a spokesman for Bush, said Thursday, ``A lot of
Texans feel safer because of that law _ women in particular.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Walker noted, Bush signed into law a measure
prohibiting Texas cities and counties from filing lawsuits against
gun manufacturers. Under the law, the Texas attorney general must
approve of the lawsuit and file on the city's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   McClellan said Bush, who has long made tort reform one of his
primary crusades, wanted to curb frivolous lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   McClellan also drew attention to actions Bush has taken as
governor that toughened firearms regulations. He signed a bill
making adults criminally responsible if their guns ended up in
children's hands and caused injury; he has also stiffened penalties
for adults who sell or give guns to under-age children.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said in Grand Rapids that the Fort Worth gunman apparently
did not have a concealed-weapons permit, so was not in compliance
with the 1995 Texas law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know his background,'' Bush said, ``but it sounds to
me like he's mentally deranged.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush focused on the aberrant emotions and impulses behind
these incidents of violence, Vice President Al Gore, the front
runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, called on
Congress to pass an array of gun-control laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to respond to the flood of guns,'' Gore said in a
campaign stop Thursday in San Diego.

 &HT;    These are hairy days for Tyson
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ On the brash and gaudy Vegas Strip, where you find
one wondrous sight after another _ where the Statue of Liberty, the
Eiffel Tower, a spewing volcano, a massive pyramid and a medieval
castle stand alongside ancient Rome, a full-fledged sea battle and
100-story tower with a roller coaster on top _ he dwarfed
everything.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a decade, Mike Tyson was billed as ``The Baddest Man
on the Planet.'' The Strip was where he became the youngest
heavyweight champ in history, where he became the game's most
savage knockout artist, where his menacing shadow eclipsed all of
the blazing neon and big marquee names. For one night's work, Tyson
could command more money than any athlete in the history of sports.
His bouts filled arenas and casinos with the kind of free spending
gamblers, celebrities and international fans that no other figure
could draw. Early this year Sports Illustrated was still calling
him ``the most galvanizing performer in sports.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday he wasn't even the biggest boxer in this town. That
title is held by Oscar De La Hoya _ the Golden Boy _ the unbeaten
welterweight who is the most marketable face this sport has ever
known. And Saturday night _ in a showdown of welterweight champs
billed as ``The Fight of the Millennium,'' a bout that matches two
of the top three pound-for-pound boxers in the game _ both De La
Hoya ($16 million) and Felix Trinidad ($10 million) will pocket
more than Tyson will make next month when fights hand-picked Orlin
Norris.
</P>
<P>
   The Baddest Man is no more. That's given way to everything from
the fattest man to one of the most broke and certainly, most
confused.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old heavyweight showed up at the MGM Grand hotel and
casino _ where he'll fight Norris, a past-his-prime cruiserweight
who's added some pounds _ to talk about yet another comeback after
yet another forced exile from the ring.
</P>
<P>
   When he walked in, it was hard to recognize him. Dressed in
white pants and vest with a billowy, open necked shirt, he looked
like a disco regular from Danny Terio's ``Dance Fever.'' Recently
weighing 280 pounds, he was down to a still-chunky 235 pounds on
his 5-foot-10 frame. As for that menacing shaved dome, it now came
with a full head of hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going through so much right now,'' he said, ``I just don't
have time to cut it.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, he'll soon will be wearing a Sly Stone Afro.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, he was jailed for 3 1/2 months in Rockville,
Md., for assaulting two motorists after a minor traffic accident
last October. Before that had come the Nevada State Athletic
Commission's 15-month fight game banishment after Tyson twice bit
Evander Holyfield's ears in their June 1997 bout. And preceding
that was his three-year prison term in Indiana after being
convicted of rape.
</P>
<P>
   Add in a $13 million bill from the IRS, substantial debts to
Showtime, the MGM and promoter Dan Goosen _ all of whom loaned him
money _ a $100 lawsuit with former promoter Don King, other legal
problems, the lingering wounds from a highly publicized divorce
some years ago and enough social and psychological baggage to weigh
down the Goodyear blimp, and it's a wonder Tyson ever fought.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he rarely has. In the past eight years, he's had just
seven bouts. Most were against nobodies. The two of note were both
devastating losses to Holyfield. Even Tyson's last fight _ a
fifth-round stoppage over lackluster Frans Botha in January _ was
close to a fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   He had lost every round on every judges card until he landed the
right hand that stopped a suddenly careless Botha. ``I wasn't
psychologically ready for that fight,'' he said. ``Actually I was
nervous. I was scared to death.''
</P>
<P>
   And because of that, Goosen _ like King before him _ now must
baby the once-bad man to be sure he has someone he can beat. The
promoter sifted through a list of lesser heavyweights and finally
came up with Norris, who fought for him a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson will get $10 million for the fight, but it's reported he
owes Showtime $33 million. For the Botha fight he was paid $25
million. His $13 million tax bill took half the check and the $12.5
million he owed in taxes from that purse, actually left him
$500,000 in the hole at the end of the bout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I owe Showtime my life,'' he said with disdain. ``I've got to
keep fighting to pay my bills. I'm just trying to get out of
debt.''
</P>
<P>
   His predicament angers him and no matter how much he tries to
praise Allah or talks about his kids, the venom and self-pity are
never far from the surface. Thursday he groused about training _
``People telling you what to do and you're a grown man,'' _ and
questions on his weight.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he let himself mushroom to 280 in ``the joint,'' as he
calls it, he shot back: ``Have you ever been incarcerated? Go out
and hit someone with your car and get incarcerated and see how fat
you get when you come out.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his jail time, he said: ``It's politically correct to put
me in jail. It becomes so pervasive. If Mike Tyson is in your
courtroom, there's got to be a malfunction in the court system if
he doesn't get jail time ... They screwed me up pretty bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed on whether he shoulders the blame, he shot back:
``Listen man, I have no one to blame but myself. Others contributed
to it, but I've got to carry the weight of the fool alone.''
</P>
<P>
   His mood darkened when asked if he ever wonders what could have
been: ``Whoever created the word coulda or woulda, it's ridiculous.
There shouldn't be racism. There shouldn't be dysfunctional
alcoholics that are reporters.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, by himself, he was more subdued for a while. ``I'm
33-years-old. I'm so young, but I seem so old.'' In the ring, he
said that translates into ``developing his skills again'' and
fighting maybe every two months: ``And if anybody makes a mistake,
they're gonna take a dirt nap. That what I get paid to do _ knock
people out and win spectacularly ... I'm still gonna win the title
again.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was suggested he he had let his fans down, he soured
again: ``It's just that I'm under a microscope ... Look around the
room. If I know some guys in here, (they) are probably perverts,
pedophiles and freaks and horrible fathers. I'm not pretty. But I'm
not as bad as most people. I have some decency and morals.
</P>
<P>
   ``... I'm just not that bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he walked out, leaving that last line lingering in the air.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the problem. In the ring, the Baddest Man on the
Planet is just not that bad.

STORM PROVES LESS DEVASTATING IN REALITY THAN MANY HAD FEARED
</HEADLINE>
   (See also HURRICANE-RDP, HURRICAN-NY-SCENE)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hurricane Floyd sent its fierce winds and torrents of
rain Thursday night into a New York region that was waiting and
well-prepared, and while the storm closed schools and businesses,
pounded beaches and flooded highways, it failed to inflict the
devastating damage many had feared.
</P>
<P>
   By early Thursday night, the storm was stoking winds of up to 62
mph and was expected to dump up to 10 inches of rain in some areas.
The brunt of the storm was set to hit Long Island by Thursday
night; the tail of the storm, meteorologists said, was expected to
leave the area by early Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Downgraded, Tropical Storm Floyd _ and the fear of Floyd _
generated a host of disruptions that altered life in the New York
region. Thursday night, transit officials _ fearful of flooded
tracks _ shut down Metro-North, but restored ``extremely limited''
service an hour later.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey and New York City, schools were closed Thursday.
On Long Island, officials ordered that residents evacuate Fire
Island and the village of West Hampton Dunes. And in Vineland,
N.J., water was coursing so rambunctiously through the sewer system
that it uncorked manhole covers.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the reality of the storm turned out to be a little less
devastating, perhaps, than people had anticipated. As of late
Thursday night, there were no reported deaths related to the storm
in the New York region. No reported injuries. No interruptions to
subway service.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the region appeared to have been less
discombobulated by the obsessively watched, Weather
Channel-friendly trajectory of Floyd than it was three weeks ago
when a surprising three-inch flash flood crippled the region's
transportation network.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the storm is about as we expected, maybe even a little
less,'' Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Thursday afternoon at a news
conference at the city's emergency crisis center.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman echoed those sentiments at a
news conference in Trenton, saying: ``We're going to get lucky it
appears. It won't be as bad as it could have been for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, officials breathed a collective sigh of relief after
girding for a storm, which, as a hurricane, had pounded the
Carolinas on Wednesday night and forced the biggest evacuation in
U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   According to meteorologists, the storm _ which at one point
covered as much area as the size of Texas _ licked coastal areas
Thursday as it churned quickly, and faster than expected, up the
East Coast, losing strength along the way.
</P>
<P>
   By early Thursday night, the storm, which was moving at 30 mph,
was passing through Long Island en route to Connecticut, the
National Weather Service said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the New York region Thursday , officials stayed glued to
their cellular phones, radio equipment and televisions in preparing
for the storm, the first hurricane to touch the region since
Hurricane Bob skirted eastern Long Island in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   There were many unilateral acts of precaution. Whitman declared
a state of emergency for all of New Jersey on Wednesday; New York
Gov. George Pataki followed suit Thursday for New York City and
Nassau and Suffolk Counties, deploying 1,500 members of the
National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   State and local officials ordered so-called nonessential
employees to leave work early, in order to alleviate any possible
rush hour crush. They encouraged private businesses and other
institutions to do the same _ and many, apparently, heeded that
advice, including the United Nations, which closed at 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, there was wall-to-wall news coverage via
television, radio and the Internet, containing the latest warnings,
offering storm-safety tips and flashing various emergency phone
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is such a well-broadcast storm that people _ or smart
people anyhow _ got off the water,'' said Petty Officer Brent Erb
of the Coast Guard, adding that there were no reports of people or
vessels in danger on the seas.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Panoz LMPR Roadster S, Dodge Viper and Porsche all
set American Le Mans Series course records in the first session of
qualifying Thursday to take provisional pole positions for
Saturday's Petit Le Mans at Road Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Panoz, driven by David Brabham, Eric Bernard and Andy
Wallace, charged around the course in 1:10.873/129.01 mph to break
the record for prototypes, set in April by Wallace in a Riley &AMP;
Scott MKIII Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Second and third in a tight pack were the BMW V12 LMRs that won
Le Mans. J.J. Lehto and Jorg Muller, at 1:12.058/126.89, edged
teammates Steve Soper, Bill Auberlen and Joachim Winkelhock, who
clocked 1:12.104/ 126.81. The No. 2 Panoz, driven by Jan Magnussen,
Johnny O'Connell and Memo Gibley, was fourth with a lap of
1:12.364/126.36.
</P>
<P>
   Olivia Beretta, Karl Wendlinger and Mark Duez had to push their
Dodge Viper to an ALMS course record 1:19.525/114.98 to edge
teammates David Donohue, Tommy Archer and Jean-Philippe Belloc
(1:20.012 /114.28) in the GTS class. In the Porsche-dominated GT
field, Cort Wagner, Dirk Muller and Sascha Maassen took their
Porsche 911 GT3R around in 1:25.617/106.80 to edge the
1:25.814/106.55 of Luca Riccitelli, Patrick Huisma and Hans Jorg
Hofer, also in a Porsche 911 GT3R.
</P>
<P>
   Qualifying resumes at 2 p.m. today. There are 51 entries
battling for 50 starting positions.
</P>
<P>
   Going global
</P>
<P>
   The American, European and Asian Le Mans Series are preparing
schedules to run in 2000 under terms of the license agreement
between Panoz Motorsports and the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO),
organizers of the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The agreement runs through
the 2008 season, and the 2000 ALMS schedule is expected to be
announced today. The 1999 ALMS has been viewed as a transition
season for participating teams to bring their equipment up to ACO
technical guidelines. For 2000, teams must be in full accordance.
</P>
<P>
   They said it
</P>
<P>
   John Paul Jr. returns to the ALMS for the first time since
Sebring, driving a Corvette. ``It's exciting to be back road
racing,'' Paul said. ``This is my first time back at Road Atlanta
since they changed the track. Everything that's happened to the
track is awesome. I've always been in love with this place, but
it's nice to see her get a face lift.''

IT BEGAN LIKE ANY OTHER CHOIR PRACTICE. THEN THE WORLD CHANGED
FOREVER.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By MITCHELL SCHNURMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ For Jaynanne Brown, it started like any
other night of choir practice at Wedgwood Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Then about 6:45 p.m. Wednesday, she saw Larry Ashbrook walking
toward the church, smoking a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, Ashbrook pulled a pistol from inside his belt
and fired a shot that grazed her head with its searing heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put my hand up and thought, `Dear Lord, is this how it feels
to die?' '' Brown said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The rampage that began at the main entrance of the church would
build to a terrifying climax over the next several minutes,
according to witnesses, victims and police. Ashbrook would shoot 14
people, killing seven, before turning the gun on himself.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, Ashbrook gave the outside world little
warning of the terror to come. One neighbor passed Ashbrook's home
in Forest Hill, a Fort Worth suburb, about 3 p.m., and saw him
sitting on the front porch, watching cars and people pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked kind of sad ... maybe a little angry,'' Patricia
Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour, Ashbrook was working on his well-maintained
lawn, attending to his pear trees and potted plants. That contrasts
sharply with his earlier behavior: Investigators said he trashed
the inside of his home and tore the family Bible to pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Around 6:30, investigators said, Ashbrook walked out of his home
for the last time. He was dressed in a short, dark green jacket,
blue jeans and tennis shoes. A white baseball cap was pulled down
near his eyes, and he wore sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few miles to the west, more than 100 teens were starting
a religious rally at Wedgwood. The church had recruited a Christian
band, prepared skits and publicized the gathering to other
churches.
</P>
<P>
   The band was about to start playing as Ashbrook's car arrived.
He approached a few adults, asking about the prayer meeting. As
Ashbrook neared the entrance, Brown and some friends worried aloud
about him smoking in the church.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Laster, a maintenance worker, approached him and asked him
to put out the cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said Ashbrook reached inside his jacket and pulled out a
gun that police later identified as a Ruger 9mm semiautomatic. He
fired into Laster's abdomen, badly wounding him. He then turned to
the couch and fired one bullet into the head of Sydney Browning,
killing the 36-year-old director of the children's choir.
</P>
<P>
   He then fired at Brown, who slumped to the couch. As Ashbrook
moved on, Brown realized that she was not badly hurt and scampered
out.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook, heading toward the sanctuary, encountered Shawn Brown
beside a rack of CDs and shot him. The 23-year-old seminary student
ran several yards before dying in the hallway, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook fired a few bullets through a window into the
sanctuary, but people inside said they didn't realize anything was
amiss. Even as he entered the room and began yelling, many assumed
that he was part of a skit and that the shots were blanks.
</P>
<P>
   But as victims began to fall, teens started diving to the floor.
A few scrambled to help others. Mary Beth Talley, 17, ran to the
sanctuary to warn others and was struck by a bullet as she helped a
small friend.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook sprayed the sanctuary, emptying three magazines of
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Cassandra Griffin, Joseph Ennis, Susan Kimberly Jones and Justin
Ray would die at the scene. Kristi Beckel would die shortly after
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Five more would be injured.
</P>
<P>
   As Ashbrook cursed and paced, he moved to the right side of the
sanctuary and tossed a pipe bomb near the stage. It exploded but
injured no one seriously.
</P>
<P>
   By then, police were on their way. Chip Gillette, who had been
off duty, was alerted to trouble about 6:50 p.m., when his dog
began barking toward the church across the street.
</P>
<P>
   When Gillette went outside, he ran into people screaming and
fleeing. Gillette ran home, called police on his radio, grabbed a
gun and bulletproof vest, and ran back to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:55, the police received three 911 calls. Three more came a
minute later. Four more at 6:57.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette said he and another officer entered the church. He
immediately saw his friend, Browning, dead on the couch, and his
fear grew as he moved down the hall, knowing that his wife and
daughter were at the church.
</P>
<P>
   He heard several more gunshots, then it turned strangely quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a few moments, it seemed unreal because it was so
silent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 10 feet from the sanctuary door, he heard one more
shot _ what turned out to be the bullet that Ashbrook put into his
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the doors opened up and kids just poured out,'' he said.

SPORTS COLUMN: LIKE BIRD, PARCELLS MAY DECIDE TO GO

<P>
   Larry Bird does not plan to coach after next season, and this
should surprise no one who saw the resignation in his face as his
Indiana Pacers surrendered their championship dream, like the
victim of a holdup on a dark New York street.
</P>
<P>
   With two of the most focused, penetrating eyes basketball has
known, Bird took a hard look at the soul of his team last spring
and clearly saw that it lacked what it takes. If he evaluated
himself just as honestly, then he has also by now acknowledged
that, in the chess match of coaches, the New York Knicks' Jeff Van
Gundy was bishop to Bird, the rook.
</P>
<P>
   When Bird didn't obstruct the Pacers' trading of Antonio Davis,
their best big man, for a high school prospect in the National
Basketball Association draft last June, that was the clue. In
promoting a recently published book the other day, Bird said he
would coach the remaining year of his contract, and no more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was actually a little surprised that he got back into the
fray in the first place,'' Nets coach Don Casey, a former Boston
Celtics assistant, said Thursday. ``We used to talk about life some
when he was at the end of his career. His mother died of the same
thing mine did, Lou Gehrig Disease. I always got the feeling Larry
wanted to walk away and view the game from a distance. But Indiana
had a shot, it was his home state and I guess it was within his
competitive nature to try and get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   At the height of opportunity, the Pacers wilted, their veteran
core defining itself as, at best, a quality conference final
opponent. Donnie Walsh, the team's president, began the inevitable
overhaul, but people who are used to playing or coaching for the
ring don't wait around for teen-agers to become men. Larry Bird
doesn't need the money, and apparently has good reason to not risk
the stress.
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, Bird reveals that he has for years been dealing
with an irregular heartbeat, which once almost caused him to pass
out while coaching a game. The health and stress factor has,
likewise, been a factor for Bill Parcells, since he had heart
surgery following his time with the New York Giants. No one will
ever confuse Bird the coach with Parcells the genius, but in the
terms of what they demand, of others and themselves, these proud
men are more than similar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' the Tuna defiantly snapped earlier this week
when asked if the calamities that have befallen his team so soon
this season might affect his decision to coach on next year.
</P>
<P>
   This was contrary to what Parcells told HBO's ``Real Sports'' a
few weeks ago, when Vinny Testaverde's feet were intact, when the
Super Bowl was more than a plausible goal. In a show that aired
this week, the 58-year-old Parcells was asked if this season could
be his last. ``I think there's a chance it could,'' he said. ``I
always felt I wasn't going to coach when I was 60.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells went on to reveal that he couldn't relax after last
season, couldn't let go. ``It was scary,'' he said, and he also
admitted being spooked by the cancer that recently took the life of
Seattle assistant coach Fritz Shurmur, a friend and peer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to have a little time, do a couple of things,''
Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   While a sound argument could be made that the rash of New York
Jets injuries would insure the coach's return next season, Parcells
must still determine from the rest of this season whether a
championship run was canceled by bad luck, or merely postponed. He
built this veteran team quickly, to correspond to his own
professional agenda, and to the octogenarian wishes of the late
owner, Leon Hess. Now Hess is gone and new ownership is imminent.
Parcells, never that easy to work with, may not be so enamored of
the next boss.
</P>
<P>
   Footballs sometimes take the strangest, most fateful bounces.
Who knows when Testaverde, if ever, will come all the way back?
Parcells is not likely to spend much time chasing a last
championship with Rick Mirer, or with any other quarterbacks he
can't trust. He certainly isn't interested in presiding over a team
not reaching for the top, any more than Bird, who clarified his
position this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years is enough for a coach in any one place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Early last spring, it seemed the Celtics' legend was the calm,
stoic leader of the logical heir to Jordan's Chicago Bulls. The
next minute, out of nowhere, Marcus Camby and the Knicks were
rejecting the thought, suspending belief.
</P>
<P>
   Jets fans beware: Bird's planned flight could be a preview of
the path that Parcells soon chooses for himself. &QL;

HEY, DON: THIS ONE SELLS ITSELF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Calling it ``The Fight of the Millennium'' is Don
King's job, not Jim Lampley's.
</P>
<P>
   Semantics aside, Lampley won't have to show much restraint when
he does the blow-by-blow Saturday night of the Oscar De La
Hoya-Felix Trinidad fight. It is being touted as the greatest
attraction for a non-heavyweight fight in pay-per-view history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a phrase you'd hear me tossing out without some
context,'' Lampley said Thursday morning, stuck near the Lincoln
Tunnel as he tried to get a flight out of rain-drenched New York,
hoping to make it to Las Vegas by Saturday to change into a tux.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, no fight was bigger than Ali-Frazier I. This isn't
bigger than that. And most who call it `fight of the millennium'
don't even know when the millennium changes. They'll have another
year to work up another `fight of the millennium' and they don't
even know it yet. Once they do, they'll surely try to take
advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   (For the record, the new millennium doesn't begin in 2000. The
20th century ends and 21st century begins in 2001. We don't make up
the rules. We just report them).
</P>
<P>
   As if De La Hoya-Trinidad needs one of those ridiculous
promotional titles. Here's a rare instance when a pay-per-view bout
doesn't have to bog itself down in predictions of home sales
figures and dollar amounts. But because of the legacy it has
created in the past decade _ that's a 10-year period, by the way _
promoters of the final fight of the '90s indulge in a screaming
match that doesn't even make sense.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad, because TV viewers already get the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nature abhors a vacuum,'' said Lampley. ``Don't let the facts
get in the way. Trying to convince Don King this fight needs no
promotion is like telling him don't bother waking up tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from that, De La Hoya-Trinidad will attract a predicted
800,000 to one million home buys at $49.95 a whack. The current PPV
leader in a non-heavyweight bout is De La Hoya-Pernell Whitaker,
which did more than 800,000 in April, '97 and went for $39.95.
</P>
<P>
   The difference now is there are about 42 million homes with
addressable cable or satellite dishes, which will produce millions
of dollars more. So when someone like TVKO executive Mark Taffet
says, ``this will be one of the greatest events in pay-per-view
history,'' he's talking volume.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya's last pay fight, in February against Ike Quartey,
had about 600,000 buys. That's about in line with his bouts against
Hector Camacho (Sept. '97) and Julio Caesar Chavez (Sept. '98). In
seven pay fights during his career _ those on TVKO, not just HBO _
De La Hoya has attracted 3.5 million buys that have resulted in
$150 million.
</P>
<P>
   But enough of the numbers, says HBO executive producer Ross
Greenburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to look at this as more an historical fight than a
cash machine,'' said Greenburg, whose boxing experiences at the
network go even further back back than its closed-circuit telecast
of the 1981 Sugar Ray Leonard-Thomas Hearns classic, which is being
compared to this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 12th round, when De La Hoya is digging deep, he isn't
wondering how many buys the fight has,'' said Greenburg. ``These
two enjoy cashing checks, of course, but that's not why they're
here or why we're going to watch. It's unfortunate that boxing
takes on this business sense with these pay-per-view bouts. We need
a return to the dramatic heroics and stop looking at the cash
register.''
</P>
<P>
   That'll happen soon enough. Within two months after this fight,
King has the honor of pimping Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis II, a
pay-per-view gold mine set up because of their controversial draw
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   King already predicts an unheard of two-million home buys for
that Nov. 13 fight, saying: ``The rematch will do more pay-per-view
than any fight has done because of the alleged scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   So enjoy the purism of De La Hoya-Trinidad while it lasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sport is plagued by fighters protected by their managers
who look for the big pay-per-view payoff, and for these two, it's a
rarity,'' Lampley said. ``Everyone has waited for this for five
years. This should be an example to other fighters to meet the best
guy available. I hope other fighters notice, and I hope the fans
don't let the other one (De La Hoya or Trinidad) drop off the map
just because they lose, because neither deserves it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in cyberland: The mandatory Internet link to this
bigger-than-life event takes place at a site developed by Excite
(www.excite.com/oscarfelix). It did a Webcast of Wednesday's press
conference with the two fighters and has had live chats each day.
</P>
<P>
   Today's weigh-in can be seen there at 6 p.m., which follows a
live chat with Don King at 5 p.m. There's also an auction for the
Oscar De La Hoya Foundation with bidding on autographed gloves and
a fight post from the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Other info and trinkets for sale can be found at the sites for
Top Rank (www.toprank.com), TVKO (www.tvko.com) and De La Hoya
(www.oscardelahoya.com).
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, it also should be noted, is a recent enshrinee at
the Male Celebrity Navel Academy, which, in essence, is the Web's
Belly Button Hall of Fame (www.tigerx.com/bbs/men/index.htm). He is
one of 24 men and a few hundred women so honored. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHAT SMOKES &QL; 
_Our Monday afternoon ex-quarterback, Terry Bradshaw, whose
hour-long, noon-to-1 p.m. show on KXTA-AM (1150) wasn't embraced
here with open ears, proved his worth the day after the NFL season
opener. With all the stuff the former Pittsburgh Steelers QB and
Fox NFL analyst had to discuss, the show could have gone four hours
_ but unfortunately didn't. At last, the benefits of having
Bradshaw on the radio outweigh the promotional value he brings to
the station. It's a complete reversal of what happened with the
Karl Malone hiring during the NBA strike. Now, if we can just
eliminate the callers and all those commercial spots that have to
be there to pay the bills for Bradshaw's services. &QL; 
_Both Bradshaw and ESPN's Chris Mortensen have interviews with
Green Bay Packers quarterback Bret Favre for their respective
Sunday NFL pregame shows. &QL; 
!arrow!Fox Sports Net's ``NFL This Morning'' has added recently
retired Cleveland Browns linebacker Chris Spielman to the lineup
for the rest of the season. &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES &QL; 
_The sailors say Brandi, you're a fine girl: A few months after her
black-and-white, pretty much bare-it-all photo in Gear magazine got
the relative unknown some great exposure, U.S. women's soccer
sensation Brandi Chastain reappears in the October issue _ in
color, and more revealing. Plus she's actually !ital!interviewed
this time. The cover headline tease: ``Sex, Soccer and Me: Brandi
Chastain Talks.'' This smells of an ongoing series that readers
will be forced to gear up for. Coming in November: ``Brandi
Chastain Does Stuff Like Other Human Beings _ Eats, Sleeps, Pays
Bills _ All With Her Clothes On!'' &QL; 
_What do John Elway, Tiger Woods, Nolan Ryan, Florence Griffith
Joyner, Karch Kiraly, Ken Griffey Jr., Mark McGwire, John McEnroe,
Gail Devers, Sugar Ray Leonard and Evander Holyfield have in
common? All were left off the ESPN SportsCentury Top 100 list. But
remember, three horses made it.

CAPTAIN OF HER FATE IN ANY SEAS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 19) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Maine, Calif.)   (af)  
 By LAURA PEDERSEN-PIETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget the ``widow's walk'' _ the rooftop platform from which
pacing wives scanned the horizon for their seafaring husbands. Now
it's the women who might well be taking to the high seas as
fishermen. (Fisherwomen? Fisherpeople? No, thank you.)
</P>
<P>
   Technology, in the form of lighter, easier-to-control equipment,
is the big factor in helping to send dames to sea _ and to send
other women into all kinds of fields that also once required
substantial physical strength.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, deep-sea fishing can still involve strenuous work,
like loading 30-pound boxes of bait into the hold. But ``there's no
job I can't do on the boat,'' said Linda Greenlaw, a 5-foot-3,
135-pound woman who was captain of a 100-foot swordfishing vessel
for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   Things have certainly changed in the 70 years since Ms.
Greenlaw's grandparents hauled in their catch by hand. Back then,
every task from pulling up anchor to bringing in a 500-pounder was
performed manually.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with all the hydraulics and electronics aboard commercial
fishing boats, most of the backbreaking work is eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can open a doorknob, then you have the physical
strength to operate a boat,'' said Ms. Greenlaw, 38, from her home
on Isle au Haut, off the coast of Maine. ``You need only turn a
handle, press a button or open a valve to do all the lifting,
lugging and tugging that used to be done by hand.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in most equipment-intensive lines of work, brawn has
become secondary to brains; no longer must workers be able to
bench-press their weight. As a result, many occupational barriers
have fallen over the last 10 years. Women have greatly increased
their presence in areas as diverse as the Forest Service,
long-distance trucking and construction work.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the trend has been a plus for the economy, said Paul
Saffo, a director of the Institute for the Future, a research
organization based in Menlo Park, Calif. ``The quality of the labor
force goes up,'' he said, ``because employers have a broader field
from which to select employees.''
</P>
<P>
   None of that, however, means that it is easy to run a
steel-hulled deep-sea fishing boat in the North Atlantic, or to
live with a five-member crew for 30 days at a time. Contending with
savage weather, equipment failure, too few fish and too many sharks
is often done in a state of mind-numbing exhaustion: When she was
at the helm of the swordfishing boat, it was not unusual for Ms.
Greenlaw to work 10 consecutive 21-hour days.
</P>
<P>
   And as for her all-male crews, Ms. Greenlaw says she got
whatever respect she was due the old-fashioned way: She earned it.
</P>
<P>
   Though she has since switched to captaining a lobster boat, a
job that, among other things, lets her return to shore each night,
Ms. Greenlaw spent those 16 years as the captain of the Hannah
Boden, the sister ship of the Andrea Gail, which went down in the
freak 1991 Atlantic tempest memorialized in ``A Perfect Storm,''
Sebastian Junger's best seller (Norton).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Greenlaw recently published a memoir of her own, ``The
Hungry Ocean'' (Hyperion), that describes her life as a captain by
focusing on one 30-day trip in which her crew had a tremendous
catch _ 56,000 pounds of swordfish, kept frozen on board.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Greenlaw is quick to note, technology on fishing boats
has also helped to tip the odds against Moby Dick. Electronic
navigation systems make it easier to find fish than it was when
fishermen ``had a sixth sense or could feel when conditions were
right and where the fishing was good.'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On the swordfishing boat, she had a color sounder, Doppler
current indicator and surface temperature gauges. Her fax machine
cranked out updated weather maps. So much for ``red sky at night,
sailors' delight/red sky in morning, sailors take warning.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to leveling the ocean for women, technology is
helping all fishermen by minimizing the kind of injuries that could
sink a career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago,'' Ms. Greenlaw said, ``a guy would have a bad back
by the age of 30.'' Proof of the new staying power is James
Greenlaw, Linda's father, who at 69 regularly fills in as captain
on her lobster boat.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced communication systems have also improved the safety
margin for deep-sea fishing. Should all else fail, Ms. Greenlaw
said, a sophisticated radio ``immediately transmits the name of my
vessel and exact position to the Coast Guard.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But technology hasn't solved the road warrior problem _ or ocean
warrior problem _ of the industry: Women and men with their sights
set on raising a family generally prefer not to be away from home
for extended periods.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the long trips don't help in finding a partner,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ```Thanks for dinner, see you in 30 days' is not exactly a
relationship-builder,'' explained Ms. Greenlaw, who is single.
</P>
<P>
   But men who don't share her craving for adventure and deep
respect for the sea probably need not apply. ``I love being on a
boat out in the middle of the ocean,'' she said. ``Even if I was
pregnant, I'd have no problem going out.''
</P>
<P>
   Like any successful fisherman, however, she will take only
sensible risks. ``Well, maybe the final few weeks'' of that
pregnancy, she said, ``I wouldn't go out on a long trip.''

IN HISPANIC PHILANTHROPY, THE PERSONAL TOUCH  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 19) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill., Calif., Fla.)   (af)  
 By LAURA CASTANEDA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the town of San Miguel Epejan in the Mexican state of
Michoacan needed a new road, former residents who had emigrated to
the Chicago suburb of Aurora, Ill., held raffles, sponsored dances
and knocked on hundreds of doors asking for donations.
</P>
<P>
   In less than two years, their local organization, Club de
Michoacan, raised more than $100,000 to help the Mexican government
complete the road, which opened a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my town in Mexico, you call people your `uncle' even if
they're not related to you,'' said Gonzalo Arroyo, a native of San
Miguel Epejan and president of the Michoacan Federation, which
oversees 25 such clubs in Illinois. ``It's like a large family, and
you rely on each other for lots of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Such are the familiar, personal ways of Hispanic philanthropy in
the United States. And now, those mainstream philanthropic
organizations that have lamented their inability to reap Hispanic
donations are trying to better understand those ways.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, Hispanic people are starting their own
businesses at rapid rates and joining the middle class in
increasing numbers. The new efforts to strengthen Hispanic
nonprofit groups and to help mainstream philanthropies gain more
Latino donors include a five-year, $15 million program of Hispanics
in Philanthropy in Berkeley, Calif., a group of Hispanic people who
work at a wide range of grant-making institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The program will award its first grants next year to nonprofit
agencies that provide social services to Hispanic people.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer, experts on Hispanic philanthropy provided
potentially influential guidance in a book called ``Nuevos
Senderos: Reflections on Hispanics and Philanthropy'' (Arte Publico
Press, 1999) and as part of a report called ``Cultures of Caring:
Philanthropy in Diverse American Communities'' by the Council on
Foundations, a Washington-based association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential of our community is terrific, and it needs to be
acknowledged,'' said Henry J. Ramos, of Mauer Kunst Consulting, who
contributed to ``Nuevos Senderos'' and wrote the Hispanic section
of the ``Cultures of Caring'' report. ``But this potential cannot
be capitalized on unless mainstream institutions do a better job of
understanding Latino culture and needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramos's research shows that Hispanic people tend to give to
religious organizations, mutual aid societies like the Clubs de
Michoacan or directly to needy friends and family members in the
United States or their native countries instead of to mainstream
philanthropies. Donors often cite a sense of responsibility to
their communities _ in the United States and elsewhere _ and to
their extended families and social circles.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic donors also report that mainstream philanthropies make
few efforts to solicit their support.
</P>
<P>
   When the charities call on wealthy Hispanic people, they
sometimes make the mistake of dwelling on financial planning and
tax advantages. Experts say Hispanic donors are more interested in
exactly who the gifts will benefit and how; sometimes they even
want to meet the beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The few quantitative studies on Hispanic people and philanthropy
confirm that donations are rising but that nonprofit groups are
slow to seek their gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Contributions to organized philanthropic groups by the average
Hispanic household jumped 55 percent from 1993 to 1995, to $547,
according to the most recent figures from Independent Sector, a
Washington-based coalition of charities. But, it said, just 44
percent of Hispanic households were ever approached by any
charitable organization in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mainstream philanthropy assumes that if Latinos are poor, they
don't have money to give,'' said Diana Campoamor, the director of
Hispanics in Philanthropy. ``In fact, they give in proportion to
their income.''
</P>
<P>
   The amount of informal giving by Hispanic people to those they
know personally is, of course, difficult to measure. But the amount
may be significant. Money sent from immigrants in the United States
to six Latin American countries _ Mexico, Colombia, the Dominican
Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua _ amounted to almost
$8 billion in 1998, according to the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute
in Claremont, Calif., which based its estimates on research by the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of the giving that happens in Latino communities is
never counted and not recorded,'' said Anna Gloria Rivas-Vazquez, a
fund-raiser for the Carrollton School of the Sacred Heart in Miami
who has done research on Latinos and philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   Groups are finding that Hispanic donors are more likely than
others to support causes or organizations that have touched them
personally. Consider Bob Vila, the home renovation guru, whose
parents came to the United States from Cuba. He received good
grades in high school and wanted to go to college to study
architecture, but his guidance counselor offered little help. ``I
had to mine the territory myself just to get to Miami-Dade Junior
College,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So earlier this year, Vila, 53, established the Vila Family
Foundation with $400,000 to support several Miami programs that
help Hispanic students get into college. He also sends money to an
elderly relative in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never thought of it as `philanthropy,''' Vila said.
``I've just thought of it as part of my responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos A. Saladrigas, 51, chief executive of ADP Totalsource of
Miami, a payroll processor, has donated more than $1 million to
charity. He says he has always given to human rights groups,
because he recalls fleeing Cuba as a boy. After his youngest son
was diagnosed with diabetes, he also began giving to the Juvenile
Diabetes Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   As Saladrigas put it, ``The key to the Latino pocketbook lies in
the heart.''

   STANSTED, England _ Like the proud mother of a newborn, Barbara
Cassani bounces into the reception area of Go, the no-frills,
low-cost European airline, showing off and pointing out every facet
of her company _ ``my baby,'' she says _ down to the dowdy details
of the cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``I buy my sandwich out of that really elegant machine over
there,'' she said with a laugh, apologizing for ``probably smelling
a bit tuna-y from lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cassani (pronounced cas-SAN-i), at age 39 the chief
executive of Go Fly Ltd., shares responsibility for the company
with its true parent, British Airways PLC. Three years ago, Robert
J. Ayling, the president of British Airways, tapped Ms. Cassani, an
American, to write a business plan for a low-cost airline with the
promise that if she could show it could be profitable, she could
run it. It's not profitable just yet _ Go has been in business just
a little more than a year _ but Ms. Cassani said it would break
into the black by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In that first year, she has already had to deal with low-cost
competitors wielding words and lawsuits. Easyjet tried to ground Go
by filing a lawsuit contending that the airline's pricing was
anticompetitive. Richard Branson, who founded Virgin Express along
with Virgin Atlantic, his original rival to British Airways,
initially said, ``I think they are determined to get rid of
low-cost carriers and subsidize Go to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Branson and other competitors contended that Go was a pawn in a
larger plan by British Airways to eliminate the no-frills, low-cost
niche by undercutting everyone's prices.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in her no-windows office at Stansted Airport outside
London, Ms. Cassani recalled that time. ``I think people love
conspiracy theories, she said. ``I just put my head down and got on
with it. It actually helped raise the profile of the company.'' The
lawsuits have since been dropped and, lately, most rivals have been
less outspoken.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cassani has had high ambitions since her middle-class
childhood in Boston and San Francisco. ``I've always been old for
my age, but it's catching up with me,'' she said. Growing up, she
cleaned houses and worked at a Burger King _ to pay for things like
the feeding and upkeep of her own horse. ``I've always wanted to do
things that required money,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cassani went to Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley,
Mass., for her undergraduate degree and then to the Woodrow Wilson
School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University
for a master's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't supposed to be a business person,'' she said. ``I was
supposed to grow up and move to Washington, D.C., or join an
international organization or go run a state somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she ended up joining Coopers &AMP; Lybrand in Washington as
a consultant in its international division. In 1986, Ms. Cassani
transferred to the company's London offices with her husband, Guy
Davis, ``a Brit,'' she explained. Now an investment banker in the
London office of Wasserstein Perella, he had met her while she was
at Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, after reading a newspaper advertisement, she found
a job in sales and marketing with British Airways. In short order,
she worked her way up, turning around Dan-Air, a small European
airline that British Airways had bought in 1992 and that was losing
money. She went to New York in 1993 as the general manager for
British Airways' United States operations.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1997, the call came to take a stab at starting an
airline. ``I've always been a maverick, but I've never been an
entrepreneur,'' she said. ``I think I had no idea what I was
getting into personally, because if I did I probably would have
been frightened by the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a $40 million investment from British Airways, Ms.
Cassani likes to view Go as a separate company, like a true
start-up with all of the same foibles and hiccups that all
companies have in their first months. When she started, the company
had two employees. Now it has 500. ``I used to know everyone's
name,'' she lamented.
</P>
<P>
   Since Go began in May 1998 with just two routes, it has expanded
to 13 from Stansted Airport, with Barcelona and Prague to be added
later this month. A typical round-trip fare to Rome is $187,
compared with $570 on British Airways. Like Southwest Airlines,
which Ms. Cassani studied, Go has few frills. Sandwiches and coffee
are available, but cost extra.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether Go is taking customers from its parent, Ms.
Cassani said bluntly: ``It's irrelevant. If I weren't cutting into
their sales, someone else would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts predict that Ms. Cassani could be Ayling's heir
apparent at British Airways, though Ayling, at 52, has no plans to
retire anytime soon. Ms. Cassani expertly dismisses the
speculation. ``I'm a person of the moment,'' she said. ``I've never
sat down and said, `This is my path.'''
</P>
<P>
   In a country where executives like to be addressed as ``Mr.,''
she is always ``Barbara,'' casual, chatty and warm. She is the
mother of two children, aged 4 and 7, and drives a Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a pretty strict mother,'' she said. ``Very little junk
food and no TV. I import tapes from the U.S. My dad tapes PBS and
sends them over.''
</P>
<P>
   As for being the only women to be chief executive of an airline,
even a corporate subsidiary, in the world, Ms. Cassani shrugs.
``Running a business here in the U.K., particularly being a woman,
is just far too big a deal,'' she said. ``The point at which some
woman starts up a business and nobody cares about it, that's when
we'll all we know we made it.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ My friend scowled as she circled the black 2000
Lincoln LS. She turned up her nose as she peered inside. She sat
silently as we went for a drive. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it,'' she said apologetically when we returned,
sheepishly recalling my raves about the Lincoln. Her complaints:
The LS's body is too small and plain, its interior is too spare and
its ride is too firm.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln had done its job, I thought, as she lumbered away in her
large, plush Lincoln Continental. A professional woman in her 50s,
my friend had always driven American luxo-barges. She was seeking
her father's Lincoln, and the LS is certainly not that. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The LS, which went on sale in the summer, is aimed at the
increasingly affluent baby boomers who buy luxury cars mainly from
Europe and Japan. These are smaller, sportier high-end sedans than
Detroit has usually offered, with responsive handling and a less
pillow-like ride. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until now, this was uncharted territory for Lincoln, which has
some of the oldest customers in the industry. Lincoln figured it
would take a lot of time to lure new, younger buyers, but the LS
has worked even better than they expected. Already, Lincoln has
sold more than 11,000 of the sedans, roughly a third of the
expected volume for the year.
</P>
<P>
   More surprising, Lincoln is nailing its target market. LS buyers
are younger than other Lincoln owners, at about 40, and have
household incomes of $100,000 a year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I, too, figured Lincoln might struggle to convince young,
affluent buyers that the LS was worth putting on the shopping list
next to BMW or Lexus. But after multiple test drives, I concluded
that the LS is the first American car truly capable of competing
against the wave of midsize luxury imports.
</P>
<P>
   After they got the green light to develop a midsize ``entry
luxury'' car, Lincoln engineers checked their cupboard for a
chassis and found it bare. That proved to be a blessing. Another
Ford division, Jaguar, was also in dire need of a smaller car.
</P>
<P>
   The need for new iron, combined with the ability to spread costs
across two divisions, led Ford to start from scratch in developing
an all-new platform _ the basic architecture of a vehicle. So far,
this platform has spawned the LS and the Jaguar S-Type, with more
models _ including the 2001 Ford Thunderbird _ to come.
</P>
<P>
   The engineers and designers have done a masterly job of
distinguishing the Lincoln from the Jaguar. The S-Type, which
resembles its namesake of the 1960s, is smooth, powerful and
luxurious in the British tradition. The LS feels German, with the
hard-edged demeanor of a serious driver's car. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Teutonic influence should not be surprising, given
that a German, Helmuth Schrader, Ford's corporate design director
for large and luxury cars, oversaw the styling. While the LS is
generally patterned after European and Japanese entry-luxury sedans
in size, proportion and rear-drive layout, it has BMW touches like
a low hood line, which provides good visibility, and wheels that
are pushed almost to the corners. It is no head turner like its
S-Type cousin, but the LS's simple, classic style should hold up
over time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only what I consider excessive use of chrome gives the LS an
American touch. The grille is similar to that of the Navigator
sport utility, though smaller. There is chrome around the license
plate and bright accents around the windows and bumpers. Order the
$1,000 sport package, however, and most of the chrome disappears. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The chrome carries into the interior, with accents around the
gear shifter and air vents. Otherwise, the interior is classic and
simple, outfitted in muted tones and matte finishes. The leather
seats are very comfortable and supportive. The back seat, which
splits and folds, is raised slightly, giving rear passengers better
visibility. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cabin is more spacious than some competitors' because of the
car's rather long 114.5-inch wheelbase. The LS has significantly
more interior room than the more expensive BMW 5-Series. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I had a few complaints: The windows, save for the driver's, lack
a one-touch control. The power adjustment for the outside mirrors,
at the left of the dashboard, is obscured by the steering wheel.
I'd prefer the hand brake, situated along the center console, to be
tucked under the dash. The wood trim is fake; the real thing would
be more fitting for a car with the LS's ambitions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the LS's forte is not its design, but its responsive
handling. If you took off the badges, a driver zipping around sharp
corners and sweeping curves would swear this car came from Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Does the LS handle as well as the unflappable BMW 5-Series?
After comparing the cars on a slalom course, I thought not. Still,
the LS gives the 5-Series a run for the money _ for roughly $10,000
less. While older Lincoln owners like my friend may consider the
ride too firm, I found it quite pleasant in around-town motoring.
</P>
<P>
   The brakes also impress. Stomp on the pedal, and the car stops
quickly and stays level, rather than diving like a porpoise. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The LS has essentially the same engines as the S-Type, though
they are slightly less powerful: The 3-liter V6 has 210 horsepower;
the 3.9-liter V8 has 252. Both have adequate, but not
extraordinary, power. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both engines are available with a new smooth-shifting five-speed
automatic. The V6 can be ordered with a manual transmission _ the
first in a Lincoln since 1951. Typically, I'd prefer the manual,
but the LS's stick shift felt sloppy, a trait that Ford executives
promise to fix. The automatic was as smooth as silk, but emitted a
tiny whine as the car accelerated from a stop, another problem
engineers are tending to. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The V6 model, which is lighter and has a better front-rear
weight balance, feels more agile. Still, for just $4,000 more, I'd
pick the more potent V8. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Buying an all-new car is always risky in the first year of
production. The quality in all three of the Lincolns I tested
appeared generally high.
</P>
<P>
   Further, I suspect that Lincoln will bend over backward to
please customers new to the brand. For the moment, the LS
represents one of the best deals around, with most items standard,
including side air bags up front, anti-lock brakes and power seats,
doors and windows. The V6 with the automatic starts at $31,450; the
manual version, which adds the sport package, starts at $32,250.
The V8 model starts at $35,225. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I suspect that the prices will go up. Indeed, Jacques A. Nasser,
Ford's chief executive, recently made the offhand comment that
``we're selling them too cheap.'' &QL;

GRUESOME TESTIMONY CAPS DRAMATIC TESTIMONY IN DRAGGING DEATH TRIAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRYAN, Texas _ Before decapitation ended his torture, dragging
victim James Byrd Jr. ground his elbows, knees and heels to the
bone, shifting his weight in a futile attempt to relieve his
``devastating pain,'' a pathologist testified Thursday as
prosecutors wrapped up their capital murder case against a white
supremacist.
</P>
<P>
   The gruesome testimony from Dr. Tommy Brown drove two of Byrd's
sisters from the courtroom and left several jurors in tears.
</P>
<P>
   It capped a day of dramatic testimony and evidence, including
the reading of Lawrence Russell Brewer Jr.'s own writings in which
he boasted to co-defendant John William ``Bill'' King that they had
a 70 percent chance of getting away with the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our word against (co-defendant) Shawn Berry's,'' Brewer
wrote in a note intercepted by jailers at the Jasper County Jail
shortly after the three white men were arrested. ``Be for real.
What's the worst they can possibly do? Pull prints off a 20-foot
rusty ass log chain?
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at O.J.,'' he added. ``He beat his case so nothing's
imposs (sic) my friend.''
</P>
<P>
   And if they couldn't avoid conviction, Brewer indicated that he
and his fellow racist would die as martyrs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A life sentence wood (sic) do us no justice,'' he wrote. ``I
say we fight to the very last breath of air and last drop of blood
left in us, Bro, for history's sake.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my eyes, Bro, the way I see it, I wood (sic) much better be
taken out like this than to be in some fatal accident (fire, wreck,
drown),'' he continued. ``The way I picture it is all it will be is
a little o' little sleepin' medicine to slowly cary (sic) us out of
this land of the free and home of the brave ... Plus we
accomplished more than most ever dreamed of.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, prosecutors pulled a 25-foot logging chain across the
courtroom, dropping it loudly on the floor. As several of Byrd's
sisters wiped away tears, witnesses testified that they believed it
was the chain that was wound around Byrd's ankles before the
disabled black man was dragged behind a pickup more than three
miles down a rural Jasper County road June 7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI agent testified that Brewer's DNA was found on a Bud
Light bottle and a cigarette butt found at the crime scene, and
that Byrd's blood was found on Brewer's Nike tennis shoe.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors rested their case and jurors were sent home for the
day after watching an 11-minute silent video following the trail of
Byrd's gruesome death. Jurors and spectators in the hushed
courtroom were riveted, as was Brewer.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Byrd's sisters and his ex-wife were crying as they
walked toward the parking lot with their arms around each other.
They left without talking to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Byrd's sister, Betty Boatner, said that
seeing the chain and listening to the graphic testimony made it a
hard day for the family. Prosecutors had warned them that they
would show the chain Thursday morning, so Boatner took a seat at
the back of the courtroom instead of the front row where she has
been sitting with her relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting there thinking, why would anyone hook someone up
to a chain like that?'' she said. ``It's unbelievable to me _ and
it's unbearable.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on Thursday, Louis Berry, the 26-year-old brother of Shawn
Berry, testified that he had been turned off by King and Brewer
reliving their prison days, even going so far as to eat as they did
in prison even though they had access to a variety of food in the
free world.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he was offended by King and Brewer's racist talk.
Asked whether his brother had also used racist words, Louis Berry
replied: ``No. We weren't brought up that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, asked by Assistant U.S. Attorney Johnny Stevens, who is
assisting Jasper County prosecutors, what kind of people would
chain Byrd to a pickup and drag him nearly three miles until his
head came off, Louis Berry answered: ``They're definitely racists.
I don't know any other way to put it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's defense attorney, Doug Barlow, then asked, ``Would that
include your brother, Shawn Berry?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he participated in it,'' Louis Berry said. ``If he went out
there with the intention of doing that and he actually did it, then
yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Barlow and co-counsel Layne Walker, both of Beaumont, will have
the opportunity to address jurors Friday in an opening statement
and call witnesses if they wish.
</P>
<P>
   If Brewer is convicted, he would face life in prison or death by
injection.
</P>
<P>
   King was convicted by a Jasper jury last February and sentenced
to death. Berry will be tried later this year in Jasper.
</P>

YOU SAY SPEND, I SAY SAVE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 19) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ariz., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By ABBY ELLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After reading my column in the spring about how couples handle
money discussions during courtship, many people asked me how young
couples should cope with money matters once they are married or
otherwise solidly committed.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good question, especially if you think, as Gertrude Stein
did, that ``whoever said money can't buy happiness didn't know
where to shop,'' while your beloved scrimps and saves for
retirement (or vice versa).
</P>
<P>
   Such dissonance, of course, can result in financial fisticuffs,
so serious discourse is needed.
</P>
<P>
   A few months before Scott Collins, a sales manager at Midwest
Publishing Inc. in Phoenix, got married, he and his fiancee,
Sharon, had a little heart to heart. She carried credit card debt,
which drove him nuts.
</P>
<P>
   He told her that aside from maintaining a mortgage, he never
wanted to be in debt _ that he had to pay bills in full every
month. ``My thinking is, if I can't afford it, then don't spend
it,'' Collins, 29, said. ``I'd much rather start saving money now
and retire younger. She'd rather live for the day.''
</P>
<P>
   She complied _ to a point. Ms. Collins, 27, a senior brand
specialist at Tosco, the gas station and convenience store company,
controls the household finances and pays the credit card bills on
time and in full. But she goes just a little over budget on
clothing and travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different from what I would do,'' Collins said. ``I panic
sometimes _ `What if we can't pay our mortgage?' _ but she works
just as much as I do, she makes money, and I'm not going to tell
her what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Money is one of the main things couples fight about. Part of the
problem may be the varying perceptions about money and work. For
some, it's all about security; for others, better immediate living.
Such differences help explain why, in many couples, one partner
thinks more about longer-term financial goals.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah and Wes McBride, moved from Los Angeles to Manhattan last
year. They had more than $10,000 in credit card debt and stayed
with a friend because they couldn't afford their own place. They
wanted to save enough to rent an apartment and eventually buy one.
</P>
<P>
   So they got Quicken, the financial planning software, and
painfully budgeted for everything _ even their daily tea excursions
to Starbucks. The goal was to pay off all debts and buy a home in
four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lay in bed and sobbed,'' said Ms. McBride, 25, an executive
assistant at an architectural firm and the couple's primary
breadwinner. ``No sushi for four years. I can't live like this.''
</P>
<P>
   So McBride, 30, a freelance set designer, revamped the budget,
this time allowing for the occasional movie or California roll.
``Sarah's very upset by restrictions,'' he said. ``She feels that
we're making money and we deserve to spend it. I agree with that to
an extent, but I also feel that you have to prepare for the
unknown. Sarah likes to go out to eat, and I think you can cook at
home. So we talk about it, yell, and then come to an agreement we
can both live with.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Feitelberg, a financial adviser with Chase Investment
Services in Manhattan, urges couples to accept their differences
and have several bank accounts: a joint one for household needs
and, if there's money left over, separate ones for individual
wants. But, she cautioned, both parties should know where all the
records are.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if something happens to one person and the other doesn't
know where the information is?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the matter of procreation. Since a new child adds,
on average, about $8,500 to a couple's annual overhead, Ms.
Feitelberg said, the partners should begin putting money into a
mutual fund as soon as possible to help pay the added expenses.
</P>
<P>
   They should also coordinate their investments, making sure, for
example, that their 401(k)s, considered together, have appropriate
levels of risk, growth potential and diversification.
</P>
<P>
   But above all else, it's important to take time to relax and
enjoy things, as Collins is learning to do. ``Every time we go on a
trip, I think, `Why am I doing this? We can't afford it,''' he
said. ``But afterward I think, `I'm glad I went; I had a great
time.' At some point, you've just got to stop worrying and live.'' &QL; 
 &QL;

FORT WORTH OFFICIALS VOW TO OVERCOME THE HORROR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERNIE MAKOVY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ In mourning Larry Gene Ashbrook's bloody
carnage _ eight dead, seven wounded in a house of God _ Fort Worth
leaders vowed Thursday that the city will survive while police
worked to solve the puzzle of what drove the reclusive malcontent
to his deadly deed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grieve, but not as those who have no hope,'' said the Rev.
Al Meredith, whose Wedgwood Baptist Church became Ashbrook's
target. ``It's a dark day, it's a heartbreaking day, but in the
worst of our times, for those of us who know Christ, there is
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Kenneth Barr said the city will deal with the tragedy and
move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to let one senseless act of violence define
who we are as a city,'' Barr said. ``People responded. That's who
we are. We are not that gunman.''
</P>
<P>
   A cigarette dangling from his mouth and packing two weapons,
Ashbrook strolled into Wedgwood Baptist Church about 7 p.m.
Wednesday and unleashed terror on 150 to -200 people at a church
youth rally featuring the Christian band Forty Days.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all (expletive). I can't believe you believe this
junk, and (are) singing this,'' one witness quoted Ashbrook as
yelling. Witnesses also reported Ashbrook as saying, ``This
religion is (expletive),'' acting Police Chief Ralph Mendoza said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook then exploded a pipe bomb in a church aisle and
unloaded a barrage of random gunshots that hit 14 people, fatally
wounding seven. Of the survivors, two remain in serious condition.
One of them _ Justin Laird, a high school football kicker _ is
paralyzed from the neck down, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   After the shootings, Ashbrook sat in a back pew of the
sanctuary, placed a gun to his temple and killed himself.
</P>
<P>
   He had two weapons _ a Ruger 9mm pistol and an AMT .380. The
.380, Mendoza said, was traced to a now-closed establishment called
Guns 'n Such, where it was purchased Feb. 15, 1992. The second
weapon was probably purchased at the Traders Village flea market in
Grand Prairie, a Fort Worth suburb, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meredith said now is the time for the church and community to
remember their faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hearts' desire is that the King of Darkness will not
prevail,'' the pastor said. God ``weeps with those who weep, he
grieves with those who grieve and he knows what it's like to lose a
son.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr said that although such a tragedy can happen anywhere, ``I
assure you that yesterday, `anywhere' took on a whole new
meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one particular act by one particular individual who is
no longer living and will never hurt anyone again.''
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Ashbrook and his victims were removed from the
church by 3 a.m. Thursday after the area was painstakingly searched
of any bombs or other explosive devices Ashbrook might have left
behind. None was found.
</P>
<P>
   There is no indication that Ashbrook had an accomplice or that
he was involved with hate groups, Mendoza said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any specific information as to why he committed
this crime,'' Mendoza said.
</P>
<P>
   And that is what is so puzzling.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we would have to venture a guess that it was
random,'' Mendoza said. ``For me to understand him, I would have to
be abnormal, and I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   Police identified the slain victims Thursday as Shawn C. Brown
and Susan Kimberly Jones, both 23 and seminary students; Cassandra
Griffin, 14; Joseph D. Dennis, 14; Justin Ray, 17; and Kristi
Beckel, 14, all four students; and Sydney Browning, 36, the
church's choir director.
</P>
<P>
   The wounded were identified as Laird, the football player;
Robert Debord, 17; Mary Beth Talley, 17; and Nicholas Skinner, 14,
all students; Jeff Laster, 36; and Kevin Gailey, 38.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Parr, 14, a junior at Southwest High School in Fort Worth,
was initially misidentified as one of the victims. He was not at
the church during the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday, police searched Ashbrook's home for anything
that might indicate why he went on his rampage.
</P>
<P>
   They were more stunned by the condition of Ashbrook's home than
by the evidence they found inside.
</P>
<P>
   Toilets were plugged with concrete, motor oil filled shower
heads, walls were bashed in and Bibles and family portraits were
shredded, homicide Detective Curt Brannan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appeared as someone in that house was in a violent rage.
This person destroyed and shredded what many people would cherish _
family photos, possessions of deceased loved ones, the holy
Scriptures,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokesman Bob Garrity Jr. said the search revealed a freshly
cut pipe, a hacksaw, black powder, and empty boxes for 9mm and
.380-caliber ammunition. Writings included anti-religious
statements, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had trashed his house. Furniture was thrown about, tipped
over. There were big gaping holes in the walls, family photographs
down and broken and faces cut out of the photographs,'' Garrity
said.
</P>
<P>
   Garrity said evidence indicates that the concrete Ashbrook
poured down the toilet had been purchased just hours before the
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess, if nothing else, he was making a statement he was not
coming back,'' Garrity said. ``He knew when he left the house, he
was not coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrity said witness statements and the writings found inside
the home indicate that Ashbrook fit the profile of the typical mass
killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mass murderers typically are disenfranchised white males,''
Garrity said. ``They are asocial, loners. They have a very poor
employment history.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that these people do is, they have this
fantasy life. One of the motivators is they fantasize about this
life that they don't lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know if they go out with a high body count, they'll be
remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrity said some of the writings found in the home show that
Ashbrook had a difficult time holding a job and was paranoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is putting down, `I was fired from this job. They told me
for this reason, but I really know it's for that reason,' ''
Garrity said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors and friends described him as a loner who distinguished
himself by his bizarre behavior and penchant for psychedelic drugs
in the early 1970s. He was a troubled child who forced one young
neighbor girl to eat bugs, neighbors said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook was meticulous in maintaining his yard, even pruning
and tending pear trees in his back yard three hours before his
rampage at Wedgwood Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Berry, 14, said Ashbrook used to mow her family's yard
years ago. More recently, she and her mother often saw Ashbrook
sitting on his front porch watching others.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Ashbrook was on the porch about 3 p.m. as Berry
walked past his house to visit a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked kind of sad or distressed, maybe a little angry,''
Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said that five people unaccounted for late Wednesday
night were later identified as being victims within the church.
</P>
<P>
   Restoration companies are on standy to get the church ready for
services Sunday, said an official with the American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, beneath a sky dotted with gray rainclouds, the
neighborhood of Wedgwood awoke to a gruesome reality.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors and church members began walking by the church, still
blocked off by yellow police tape, and gazed at the scene, knowing
what had happened but not wanting to believe.
</P>
<P>
   About 10:20 am, a blond-haired man made his way through the
throng of camera tripods and milling reporters to a church sign on
the corner of Wales and Walton streets. He gently placed a bouquet
of lilies at the base of the sign and walked away quietly.
</P>
<P>
   The envelope read, ``We Love You!''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, North Texas residents placed silk flowers,
carnations, daisies and a variety of other flowers at the corner
church site.
</P>
<P>
   Cards with ``To Our Angels'' and ``We Love You'' were pinned to
the flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Spahr lives in Colorado Springs, near Littleton. Less than
five months ago, his community was rocked by a vicious shooting at
Columbine High School that ended in 15 dead, including the two
teen-age gunman.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart goes out and my love goes out to the families,'' said
Spahr, who was in Fort Worth on business. ``Become one, become a
unit, pull together and love your family,'' he said. &QL;

CLIMATE AT HIGH-TECH SHIRLEY PRISON CALLED VOLATILE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANCIE LATOUR AND DANIEL VASQUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was happy hour in July at the Souza-Baranowski
maximum-security prison, and inside the cafeteria at the newly
minted facility in Shirley, some of Massachusetts' most violent
offenders were sitting down for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Along a nearby corridor, prison Superintendent Paul DiPaolo and
his deputies were lined up for a ritual few might expect at a
top-security facility: a ``happy hour'' period, where inmates can
approach officials with complaints after they've eaten.
</P>
<P>
   As DiPaolo entertained the gripe of a prisoner, another inmate
suddenly lunged at him with a rusted homemade knife, stabbing him
in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Inside a prison named after two prison guards slain by an
inmate, DiPaolo's alleged attacker, John Carillo, was a felon
convicted in the 1973 killing of a Rhode Island prison correction
officer.
</P>
<P>
   That irony, officers who work at the prison say, is a symbol of
a state-of-the-art prison in disarray.
</P>
<P>
   When state officials cut the ribbons opening the
maximum-security prison, they billed it as the crown jewel of the
commonwealth's correction system, a high-tech facility that would
alleviate prison overcrowding and keep a tight rein on the violent,
often predatory offenders other prisons couldn't handle.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one year after the doors opened, some correction officers
and their union representatives say the July 2 stabbing was the
latest symptom of a widescale problem.
</P>
<P>
   They say there have been dozens of attacks on staff since the
first prisoners arrived _ including 21 incidents from January to
June. Last week, several inmates jumped a prison officer in a
corridor, knocking him unconscious and sending him to the hospital
emergency room, prison sources said.
</P>
<P>
   And on Monday, a correction officer at the prison said, a 3-foot
piece of steel bracing _ a potentially deadly weapon in the hands
of an inmate _ apparently was ripped from a footlocker inside a
cell. It's still missing.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys and advocates for a half-dozen inmates say that in the
aftermath of the stabbing and other incidents, correction officers
have exacted retribution on inmates, attacking them and parading
their bruised bodies as examples for other prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   While union representatives and a spokesman for the Department
of Correction denied those charges, correction officers say their
main complaint is with the state _ not the inmates.
</P>
<P>
   They blame the state for leaving the prison system chronically
shorthanded, and for the lax discipline inside what is supposed to
be the state's toughest prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the irony of it,'' said a correction officer at the
year-old prison, who did not want to be named. ``Ever since this
place opened, the super, his staff, the commissioner _ everyone _
assured us that security and safety was going to be number one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the governor or anyone else knows that this
place is being run more like a day care center than a level-6
prison,'' the officer said.
</P>
<P>
   Even advocates for prisoners, who accused officers of severely
beating inmates while hiding their faces and badge numbers _ and
who say the problem is not too much restraint, but too little _
agreed the climate is volatile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guards are correct _ the situation has gotten very
dangerous there,'' said Jamie Suarez, co-coordinator of the
Criminal Justice Program for the American Friends Service
Committee, a Philadelphia-based human rights group. ``Just as the
prisoners feel trapped and frightened by these situations, I
believe the guards feel the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the $100 million facility was designed to
incarcerate and control some of the state's worst felons.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoners, some 800 overall, are guarded by a staff of about
370 correction officers, though union officials say the facility
was created for up to 400 officers.
</P>
<P>
   In a July 29 letter to state Secretary of Public Safety Jane
Perlov, Jack Flanagan, an officer in the Massachusetts Correction
Officers Federated Union, said the shortage was emblematic of a
broader problem.
</P>
<P>
   Asserting that the Department of Correction as a whole was down
about 400 officers, Flanagan wrote that the ``crisis'' has
``created a morale problem among the rank-and-file officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Charlie McDonald, a spokesman at the Executive Office
of Public Safety, said those allegations are unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   Perlov, McDonald said, ``has been assured by Correction
Commissioner (Michael) Maloney that the facilities operate every
day at a safe level, with no risk to the public, inmates or to
staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Figures provided by union representatives seem to back him up.
From 1994 to 1998, assaults on correction officers statewide have
decreased from 463 to just over 207.
</P>
<P>
   But within the walls of Souza-Baranowski, officers said, the
recent attacks point to inmate regulations that are too relaxed for
what should be the state's toughest prison.
</P>
<P>
   Under the state system, prisons are ranked from 1 to 6, with 1
being the minimum level of security and 6 the highest.
</P>
<P>
   Prisoners at MCI-Walpole, a level-5 facility, must see any
visitors behind a glass barrier, officers said. But inmates at
Souza-Baranowski can have open contact visits with friends and
family.
</P>
<P>
   And while the facility at Walpole has towers from which armed
officers can keep an eye on inmates in prison yards,
Souza-Baranowski has no such towers.
</P>
<P>
   The advocates for prisoners and the officers who guard them both
say that chronic computer problems at the site have created
dangerous situations for inmates and guards.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of the older facilites, the cells and security doors
at Souza-Baranowski are run almost entirely electronically by
computer, said prison advocate Suarez, leaving prisoners locked in
or out of their cells when the system malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
   Officers, who for security reasons declined to explain the
consequences of computer breakdowns, said the systems have had
chronic problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I open a door by computer, and I close a door by computer,''
one officer said. ``And when those computers don't work, it causes
serious problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know all those people talking about Y2K? Well, there are
two places you don't want to be on the millennium: On a plane, and
at the Suzie B.''

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ |Running on two hours of sleep, Fort Worth
Mayor Kenneth Barr cut short a trip to Mexico on Thursday to
comfort a city shocked by violence and to tell children that it is
safe to go to church and school.
</P>
<P>
   Barr, the city's mayor since May 1996, sought advice from
another Fort Worth native, Colorado Gov. Bill Owens, and spent the
afternoon with Texas Gov. George W. Bush visiting survivors of the
city's worst mass shooting ever. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Less than three hours after returning to Fort Worth from Toluca,
Mexico, Barr and his wife, Karen, faced more than 13 television
crews and a horde of national news reporters at 12:07 p.m. at the
police and fire training center near downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Barr urged children not to be afraid in the wake of the
killings. Police administrators praised nearly 300 volunteers who
regularly patrol their southwest Fort Worth neighborood and
emphasized that reported crime has declined 53 percent since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to let one senseless act of violence define
who we are as a city,'' Barr said. ``People really responded.
That's who we are. We are not that gunman.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr had been in Toluca, a Fort Worth sister city, for a
bicentennial celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, Barr carried with him a legal pad with
advice from Owens, who had to deal with a similar shooting near
Littleton, Colo. The two leaders talked by phone in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said the most critical thing was dealing with the community
once you get past the initial phase of getting the information
out,'' Barr said. ``He said, `You need to project calmness and the
perception that the community is coming together.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bush arrived by private jet at Fort Worth's Meacham Airport
about 1:45 p.m. from Michigan, where he was campaigning for the
Republican presidential nomination. The governor scrapped two
fundraisers and said he and his wife, Laura, plan to attend a city
memorial service Sunday ``on bended knee.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush stopped at John Peter Smith Hospital to visit with victims,
Southwest High School to reach out to students, and the home of the
church's pastor.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly poignant moment came when Bush met with Justin
Laird, a young football player from White Settlement paralyzed in
the shooting. The governor fought back tears, and later cried at
the pastor's house, Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are looking at a 16-year-old football player who is
paralyzed, there is not much to say,'' Bush said. ``We saw a little
boy with a great football career ahead of him who now can't play.
It's hard to do anything but to say I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr said he, too, was humbled by the hospital visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty hard to talk to people who have massive bandages
on their chests,'' the mayor said. ``I spoke to all of them, but
there's not a lot you can say. I told them, `You need to know there
are a lot of people out there praying for you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush focused on compassion, not politics, his visit had
political overtones. Bush signed a 1995 law allowing Texans to
carry concealed weapons with a permit. Democrats question his
commitment to federal and state efforts to require background
checks at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are loopholes in the laws, let's close them. If there
are laws on the books, let's enforce them,'' Bush said. ``I wish I
knew the law to make people love one another. We'd pass it in
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   At Southwest High School, Bush, Barr and U.S. Rep. Kay Granger,
R-Fort Worth, met with four students and about 20 teachers,
counselors and school administrators. One teen told Bush that she
had seen classmates once considered enemies clutching each other
and crying in the school hallway.
</P>
<P>
   School nurse Ann Tomme said the governor's visit helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives them acknowledgment of what has happened,'' Tomme
said.
</P>
<P>
   By 4:25 p.m., Barr and Bush had joined a prayer group inside the
home of Al Meredith, pastor of Wedgwood Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were pretty shaken up. One man I talked to said he dodged
five bullets and his wife was standing in front of him. He didn't
know how she survived,'' Barr recalled. ``That really drove it home
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Bush: ``This is an example of where someone's heart became
so full of hatred and evil that he would walk into a church and
randomly kill people. This is a time for us to recognize that it
requires a higher authority to heal the hate that exists in some
people's hearts.''

BUSH CALLS TEXAS SHOOTINGS AN `EXAMPLE OF ONE SICK PERSON' 

</HEADLINE>

and BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush cut short a presidential
campaign trip to Michigan on Thursday because of the shootings at a
Fort Worth church. But his position on gun control was largely
unchanged because he said ``there is no government law that will
eradicate hate and evil.``
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an example of one sick person,'' Bush said after
visiting with shooting victims and their families. ``This is an
example of where someone's heart became so full of hatred and evil
that he would walk into a church and randomly kill people.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this instance, I don't know if government could have done
something to prevent this man from walking into a church,'' said
Bush, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Gene Ashbrook, 47, described as an eccentric loner, opened
fire inside Wedgewood Baptist Church on Wednesday during a service
for teen-agers, killing seven people and himself.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth shooting was the latest in a string of deadly
mass shootings this year. The random shootings _ occurring in
California, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky and Louisiana _ have killed
dozens of people and wounded more than two dozen.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had begun a campaign swing Wednesday in Michigan. The Texas
governor visited an elementary school in Grand Rapids as planned,
but then canceled several Michigan events, including two
fund-raisers and a state Republican get-together, to return to Fort
Worth. Bush was criticized recently for canceling an
elementary-school visit in Rhode Island because of bad weather, but
later attending a fund-raiser there.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also canceled plans to attend a motor car race in New
Hampshire on Sunday so he can attend church in Fort Worth. His
wife, Laura, also scrubbed her campaign schedule. Earlier this
week, Bush had to postpone a major speech on defense policy in
South Carolina because of Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush stuck to his general anti-gun-control stance, he
told reporters in Grand Rapids, ``I really think we should make
sure people who are mentally deranged should not have guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush added, however, that passing laws can only accomplish so
much.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be a wave of evil passing through America
now,'' he said.``And as a society we can pass laws and hold people
accountable for decisions they make, but our hopes and prayers have
got to be that there is more love in our society.``
</P>
<P>
   Bush met first with relatives of Ashbrook's victims at John
Peter Smith Hospital before visiting Southwest High School, which
some victims had attended. Bush later met privately with Wedgewood
Baptist Church pastor Al Meredith.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told reporters at the school that he returned to Fort Worth
to offer his condolences to the city, not gain political points in
his presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the right thing for me to be here,'' Bush said. ``I can't
heal the wounds. But maybe I can comfort one person. Maybe I can
thank one teacher. This is a serious situation that is going to
affect this community.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth Mayor Kenneth Barr said if Bush had not rushed home
the question would be: ``Why isn't he here?''
</P>
<P>
   After his high school news conference, Bush met and joked with
many of the teen-agers gathered around him who had not been
involved in the shooting. He posed smiling for one picture when a
girl said it was for the high school yearbook.
</P>
<P>
   Before departing Michigan, and again in Texas, he was peppered
with questions about gun control, a hot-button issue that has
caused a headache for many Republicans who have been reluctant to
alienate their supporters while at the same time addressing this
year's shooting sprees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no law _ I wish we could pass it. I would sign it. _
that says people will love one another,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, another Republican presidential candidate who has
become the standard-bearer for social conservatives, suggested the
latest mass shooting revealed a pattern of crimes against religious
people and urged the Justice Department to study the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have criticized Bush for pushing through a law in
Texas that allowed licensed citizens to carry concealed weapons and
for his decision not to urge the Texas Legislature to close a
loophole that allows firearm purchases at gun shows without
background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush defended Texas's concealed weapons law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a dangerous society, and if people want to protect
themselves, law-abiding citizens want to protect themselves, they
should be allowed to do so,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, the governor has largely echoed the
National Rifle Association position that the problem is not the
lack of tough gun control laws but the failure of authorities to
enforce the current regulation.
</P>
<P>
   He has endorsed a number of minor changes now before Congress,
including closing the loophole that allows guns to be purchased at
gun shows without a background check, and has said he supports the
ban on automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential
front-runner, however, pushed once again for more gun control laws.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing this week's East Coast hurricane and the shooting,
Gore said, ``There are differences between these two tragedies. A
hurricane is something we can't do anything about. It's an act of
God. but the shooting is something that people do to people.''
</P>
<P>
   As he has after the nation's other recent mass shootings, Gore
lamented the easy access troubled people have to guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do know that the availability of assault weapons and deadly
weapons in the hands of people who shouldn't have them contribute
to ... having these things over and over again,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   He called for requiring licenses for handgun purchases, closing
the gun-show loophole, re-establishing the three-day waiting period
for handgun purchases, requiring child-safety trigger locks,
raising the age of purchase and toughening the penalties for giving
guns to those who should not have them.
</P>
<P>
   Bush once again chided the Clinton administration for not
adequately funding gun-control enforcement programs. Bush also said
that he did not regret that he did not more strongly urge the Texas
Legislature this year to approve a measure requiring background
checks of those who buy handguns at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush initially said he supported the proposal, Texas
lawmakers said he did not lobby for its passage. It was killed by a
Texas House committee.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said a toughened state law would not do any good
until the federal government allows unlicensed dealers who work at
gun shows access to computerized background checks.
</P>
<P>
   While the governor acknowledged the need for some gun control
laws, he preferred to focus on the moral dimensions of the
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can pass laws. But there needs to be a higher law and that
is love your neighbor like you love yourself,'' he said.``I
recognize that hate and evil lurk in people's heart and there is no
government law that will eradicate hate and evil. That is going to
require a higher authority, much higher than a humble governor.``

 &HT;    Corrupt Olympic bid system to blame for excessive gift-giving,
officials say
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Olympics officials took the offensive Thursday
in the Olympic vote-peddling scandal and portrayed themselves as
victims in a shady system fostered by the International Olympic
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Attorney General Griffin Bell and Atlanta Olympic
Chief Billy Payne characterized the effort to host the 1996 Summer
Games as good intentions awash in a wink-and-nod game that
encouraged favor-trading and frequent rule-bending.
</P>
<P>
   In a revised report to Congress, Bell portrayed the Atlanta bid
team members as being tangled in a pattern of excessive gift-giving
and offers of scholarships and job assistance, athletic training
and free health care for IOC members and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Bell painted a picture of a perverted Olympic bid process that
exploits cities eager to land an enormous prize worth
``incalculable prestige and potentially billions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   He cast the Atlanta Olympic bid team as innocent in an
adulterated courtship that ``encouraged a practice of lobbying IOC
members in which excess was inherent.''
</P>
<P>
   The stance represented a remarkable change of tone by Olympic
officials, who had previously labeled IOC members as friends to
whom they were simply extending Southern hospitality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Atlanta group were neophytes,'' Bell said at a news
conference that coincided with the release of the report. ``They
had never been in a contest like this before.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantans were enticed to play along because, although they
had the best technical bid among the six competing cities for the
1996 host role, that wasn't enough, Bell said. ``The votes were not
necessarily cast on the merits.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition, he said, took place in a ``system known to
welcome generous gifts and travel allowances, lavish hospitality
and personal accommodations.''
</P>
<P>
   Since a vote-buying scandal erupted in Salt Lake City in
November, Payne has maintained that the bid team was guilty of no
wrongdoing. Payne contended Thursday that his group ``never
believed for one minute any of our actions or conduct were
improper.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Payne offered an apology to Atlanta for any shame the
drawn-out investigation has caused.
</P>
<P>
   ``If in our enthusiastic pursuit of the Games, if by our
aggressive marketing, we have embarrassed any of the wonderful
volunteers and citizens of this community who have worked so hard
to make these Games so successful,'' he said, ``we apologize.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell, a prominent attorney for the King &AMP; Spalding law firm that
represents the Atlanta Olympic group, offered no apology. Instead,
he blamed the IOC for encouraging the no-holds-barred competition
among bid cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite simply, the competition for the right to host these
Games was in large part about out-lobbying the competition,'' Bell
wrote in his revision of an earlier report to the U.S. House
Commerce Committee, which is investigating the Atlanta lobbying
campaign. ``The name of the game was to get the votes.''
</P>
<P>
   While the IOC had rules in place to limit gift-giving and
travel, Bell said they were ``often ignored, never enforced _ and
all the participants knew it.''
</P>
<P>
   IOC officials could not be reached for comment Thursday. Earlier
this week, IOC spokesman Franklin Servan-Schreiber deflected the
blame toward Atlanta bidders, saying they ``pushed those favors and
gifts onto the IOC members under the pretext of friendship.'' He
contended the delegates ``were not used to this systematic approach
to lobbying.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell acknowledged that an earlier report to Congress, signed by
Payne and former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, was inaccurate and
incomplete. The number of gifts that violated the $200 limit was
nearly double what was originally reported, Bell conceded.
</P>
<P>
   The former federal judge was called upon to amend the report
after federal investigators found numerous discrepancies between
Payne and Young's account and materials in 78 boxes of Olympic bid
documents. They estimated the bid group underreported its
expenditures on gifts for IOC members by $92,000 and omitted about
50 trips for members and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's improprieties were not as excessive as Salt Lake
City's and probably did not come close to the extravagances of its
competition for the 1996 Games, Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers in Salt Lake City plied IOC members with $1.2 million
in cash and scholarships in trying to land the 2002 Winter
Olympics, prompting an overhaul of the bid process and the
resignation or expulsion of 10 members of the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   Bell pointed out that Atlanta received only 19 of 86 IOC votes
on the first ballot for the '96 Games. One city was eliminated in
each round of voting, and Atlanta did not take the lead until the
final round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either we're the world's worst salesmen or there was severe
competition going on from other cities,'' he said. ``We have no way
to investigate other cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell neglected to note that most IOC members vote for the
candidate city in their own region in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Bell admitted the bid team provided many more unreported gifts
that cost more than a $403 camera and $124 in batteries for the
member from the Ivory Coast, a $273 sports jacket for the Russian
member and a $1,000 Georgia pine bowl given to the Swedish delegate
by his Atlanta hosts, Mack and Mary Rose Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Bell also acknowledged numerous shopping sprees conducted by
volunteer hostesses in which many gifts were purchased for members
and their wives at upscale stores.
</P>
<P>
   One such spree netted $1,493 in clothing, cosmetics and
toiletries for two visitors from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   When General Francis Nyangweso from Uganda lost his luggage, the
bid team spent $1,413 on clothing and a sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   Pirjo Haggman of Finland, who brought her husband and two young
children with her to Atlanta, received $1,300 in clothing, makeup,
toys and books. The bid team also paid a magician $150 to entertain
her children while their mother toured Olympic venues.
</P>
<P>
   But Bell insisted the gifts and shopping sprees were customary
in the Olympic bid environment, despite written rules to the
contrary. ``We don't think the International Olympic Committee has
ever questioned anybody about the size of gifts or ever sanctioned
anyone or reprimanded anyone for any kind of gift,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Payne still contended the Atlantans ``believed we were
playing by the rules and regulations and guidelines as we
understood them to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell said the bid records revealed 10 instances where the bid
team gave cash, checks or wire payments to IOC members. While there
was no documentation indicating what these payments were for, Bell
said he believed they were reimbursement for first-class plane
tickets purchased by the IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   Bell confirmed the bid team compiled profiles on IOC members
that indicated some could be wooed by ``extending sexual favors.''
But he said he found no evidence the team paid for or provided
sexual favors.
</P>
<P>
   Bell delivered the report Wednesday to Rep. Thomas Bliley
(R-Va.), chairman of the U.S. Commerce Committee, and Rep. Fred
Upton (R-Mich.), chairman of the subcommittee on oversight and
investigations, which is spearheading the inquiry into the Atlanta
bid.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional committee is considering legislation to bring
the International Olympic Committee under the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act. The report on Atlanta's activities appears to fuel
that effort, they say.
</P>
<P>
   After reading Bell's report, Upton said Thursday, ``What has
emerged is a pattern of troubling and disturbing events in order to
secure these Games.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell said he hoped lawmakers would examine the report and then
end the investigation, but that's not likely to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), ranking Democrat on the Commerce
Committee, said Thursday the report would have to be reviewed ``by
the relevant law enforcement authorities to close out this sorry
chapter of Olympic history.''
</P>
<P>
   Some laws may have been broken, although the statute of
limitations may have passed. Bell conceded the bid team violated
federal trade embargoes in delivering some gifts. A carburetor kit
and brake pads were given to the IOC member from Libya, and a live
bulldog to an IOC member from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   A shotgun and case, which cost $400, were given to a national
Olympic committee official from Ghana, who couldn't legally
purchase the gun himself because he was a foreigner.
</P>
<P>
   Two bid team members transported $15,500 in cash into the United
States at the request of the IOC member from Jamaica. Their action
may have violated a law that requires travelers to file a
declaration if they enter the country with at least $10,000 in
cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a legitimate reason the money was (delivered),'' Bell
said. ``It was not laundering money for drug pushers, that sort of
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell said the Olympic bid team would make available to the
public eight boxes of documents they have contended were personal
and had fiercely guarded from public inspection. The boxes contain
the more salacious dossiers compiled on the IOC members, as well as
notes written by Atlanta hostesses and drivers about their guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new disclosures are an important chapter in Atlanta
history in that the public will now have a chance to examine and
judge for themselves,'' said Peter Canfield, attorney for The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper and WSB-TV had sought a court ruling that the
Olympic records were subject to Georgia Open Records laws and
should be made accessible to the public. A judge has yet to rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's in the boxes is in the report. It's all out now,'' Bell
said. ``Whatever is in there is in there. Whatever has happened has
happened. Whatever has been done is done. And this is the end.''

$2M REPORTEDLY SENT TO FIRM LINKED TO RUSSIAN MOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Nearly $2 million flowed through BankBoston Corp. to a
company that is under investigation for allegedly illegal
activities involving billions of dollars of suspicious Russian
money, sources familiar with the matter said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The activity prompted BankBoston officials to investigate
whether any links existed between the flows and a Federal Bureau of
Investigation undercover operation involving a former BankBoston
employee in West Newton, the sources said. The bank's internal
probe had not turned up any evidence of a connection, according to
sources.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosures come in the wake of a Boston Globe report that
quoted sources as saying both BankBoston and Fleet Financial Group
had transferred several millions of dollars to accounts held by
Benex International Co. at the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators in the midst of what amounts to the largest
money-laundering inquiry in US history believe that nearly $10
billion in questionable Russia-related money passed through Benex
accounts at the Bank of New York. Officials suspect Benex, a
shadowy trading company, of having ties to the Russia mafia and
money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston spokesman Bruce Spitzer confirmed Thursday that a
``handful'' of unnamed businesses and individuals had shifted money
from their BankBoston accounts to the Bank of New York accounts.
Fleet also confirmed that it held accounts for Benex and
individuals associated with the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet, New England's largest bank and the buyer of BankBoston,
is not under any type of investigation for activities related to
Benex, spokesman James Mahoney said. BankBoston officials declined
to comment on whether investigators or regulators had contacted the
bank, but a source familiar with the matter said he did not believe
any inquiries were taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Four Fleet accounts _ one in the name of Benex, and three
belonging to two individuals associated with Benex and the Bank of
New York _ were not used in any Benex-related wire transfers and
were not suspected of any illegal activities, Mahoney said.
</P>
<P>
   But sources confirmed Thursday that other accounts at Fleet had
been used to shift several millions to Benex's Bank of New York
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney, who declined to comment on the other accounts, said the
average balance in the Fleet Benex account over the past year was
$111, while the personal accounts each had average balances of less
than $1,000. The latter accounts, opened through Fleet's New York
offices, belonged to Peter Berlin, a Russia-born US citizen and the
head of Benex. Berlin's wife, Lucy Edwards, also a Russian native,
was a vice president in the Bank of New York's East European
division. Both are under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, the FBI arrested an employee of BankBoston's West
Newton branch and two bank customers in a sting involving Russian
immigrants who allegedly sought to launder $2.7 million reportedly
tied to drug profits.

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Conspiracy consumed Larry Gene Ashbrook.
</P>
<P>
   His brother called him a paranoid schizophrenic this summer and
took up a loaded 12-gauge shotgun to keep Ashbrook away from his
Wise County home.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook exploded in violent rages in his Forest Hill
neighborhood, railing against children, life and his now-deceased
father.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook's writings blame a vague, vast conspiracy _ which he
thought included the military's special forces and the CIA _ for
his inability to keep a job. The conspirators, he wrote, tried to
implicate him as a serial killer of women in North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But as bizarre as his lifelong behavior was, few believed the
cigarette-smoking loner could have caused such devastating carnage
Wednesday at Wedgwood Baptist Church in Fort Worth. Ashbrook opened
fire at the church, fatally shooting seven people and wounding
seven others before killing himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big question in my mind is, why such a vicious attack on
such innocent people?'' homicide Detective Curt Brannan said. ``I
don't know if we will ever know for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer to those questions has eluded investigators, grieving
families and a city unaccustomed to such unbridled hate. Witnesses
said the man in sunglasses, a dark green jacket, jeans and white
hat spewed blasphemous words at the people inside the sanctuary,
belittling their belief in God, hymns and Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   This from a man whose deeply religious father contributed up to
10 percent of his income to his church in Arlington, a Fort Worth
suburb. And who, hours before the mass slaying, ripped the family
Bible apart page by page, sliced family members out of photographs
and used a shovel to hack large family portraits, investigators
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook, 47, the youngest of four children of Jack Ashbrook and
Ethel Muriel Ashbrook, was born in Fort Worth and attended Forest
Oak Middle School, Polytechnic High School, O.D. Wyatt High School
and Tarrant County College.
</P>
<P>
   Some high school acquaintances recalled Ashbrook, an art club
member, as someone who hung out with a group of other teens at
Trinity Park.
</P>
<P>
   Adults said Ashbrook was a troubled child while growing up in
Forest Hill, a Fort Worth suburb. He even forced one small girl in
the neighborhood to eat bugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lived next door to the Ashbrooks. I remember his mom, and
he had a sister in a wheelchair,'' said Jane Lane, 38, of Burleson,
a Fort Worth suburb. ``He used to make my sister eat roly-polies.
He was always kind of a strange kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook was arrested in 1971 on suspicion of marijuana
possession, but charges were never filed, police records show.
</P>
<P>
   Records show that Ashbrook moved to Jacksonville, Fla. in the
late 1970s to work for the Navy, military officials confirmed. He
never married or had children.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook moved back to Texas about 1994, four years or so after
his mother died. In July, his 85-year-old father died.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook seemed to decline into more bizarre and violent
behavior after his father died, acquaintances and police said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook's older brother, Aaron Ashbrook, called the Wise County
Sheriff's Department on July 24, saying that his younger brother
``is a paranoid schizophrenic.''
</P>
<P>
   Homicide Detective Mike Carroll, the lead detective in the
church slayings, said Aaron Ashbrook told Fort Worth police
Thursday that he has no idea why his brother opened fire on
churchgoers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew nothing about any psychological disorder, nothing
about his hatred for religion,'' Carroll said. ``He talked about
the fact that his brother thought there was a conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarrant County Mental Health/Mental Retardation has no history
of Ashbrook receiving treatment at any county or state facility,
said Shelley Buttgen, an MHMR spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   A former employer said he vaguely remembers Ashbrook.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was all mixed up,'' said W.I. Spitler, former owner of
Photo Etch in Fort Worth. ``As far as we were concerned, we
couldn't get rid of him quick enough''.
</P>
<P>
   Some neighbors said Ashbrook rarely spoke with anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry would give me these looks that I can't explain,'' said
Venita Hord, who lives across the street. She recalled one incident
several years ago when Ashbrook became upset because he thought
people in the neighborhood were talking about him. She said he
exposed himself to her and shouted obscenities at her and other
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   He was meticulous with the yard around his home, even pruning
and tending to pear trees in his back yard three hours before his
rampage at Wedgwood Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed ironic to investigators searching his Forest Hill home
_ where his family had lived for more than 40 years _ that he took
the time to tend his yard after destroying the inside of the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appeared as someone in that house was in a violent rage,''
Brannan said. ``This person destroyed and shredded what many people
would cherish: family photos, possessions of deceased loved ones,
the holy Scriptures.''

ASSESSING FLOYD'S IMPACT IN THE BAHAMAS

<TEXT>
<P>
   ABACO ISLAND, the Bahamas _ William Morris Bain walked barefoot
and somberly Thursday through his house, where the tile floors were
slick and silty from the surge of sea water that swept inside when
Hurricane Floyd struck. Outside, piles of debris were all that
remained of his tool shop and storehouse. The rushing water had
also ripped through his two sons' homes next door, where their
wives now hanged damp clothes to dry on a fallen tree trunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There ain't going to be no drying,'' he said as he showed a
visitor a waterlogged mattress. ``We got to start all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of his 65 years, Bain has worked the seas, hauling in
fish and lobster to feed restaurant diners and the family around
his dinner table. Was this some sort of watery payback, he
wondered. ``I don't know whose revenge it is,'' he said. ``But
whatever it is, it's serious.''
</P>
<P>
   The eye of the hurricane zipped through many of the towns along
this island, which is home to humble fishing villages and upscale
resorts. While physical injuries were almost unheard of, hundreds
of trees were uprooted, shingles and entire roofs were sheared off,
sections of roads were washed away, and power and phone lines went
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Several towns on Little Abaco Island appeared especially hard
hit. From Cedar Harbour to Foxtown, cars and boats were strewn
about, roads were covered with dirt and rocks, and several houses
were completely blown out. A radio tower lay crumbled near palm
trees that were bent sideways like pipe-cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   Three helicopters sent by the United States ferried U.S. and
Bahamian officials to outlying islands that were in the eye of the
hurricane. While relieved at finding hardly any casualties, they
also realized that repairs to homes and public services would
present enough of a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a country this size, it truly can be a financial
disaster,'' said U.S. Ambassador Arthur Schechter, who had also
visited several islands on Wednesday with Prime Minister Hubert
Ingraham. ``The damage to the infrastructure is so extensive, from
what I've seen, I would say it runs into the tens of millions of
dollars. In a country like this, that's devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   Houses in some areas withstood the winds only to be swamped by
water. Bruce Lightbourne, a lobster fisherman who lives near the
narrow, southern part of Abaco, said the lower floor of his
split-level home was filled with water, and his car was still
submerged in the garage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere, there is water damage, from sea to sea,'' he said.
``We're on a little peninsula, only two miles wide at most. The
wind came out of the northeast and blew the water into the swamp.
After that, it just took over.''
</P>
<P>
   On Moore's Island, about 20 miles west of Great Abaco, small
fishing boats were sent into front porches, and chunks of roadway
crumbled. Many wooden homes were reduced to pastel piles of planks
covered with musky sea grass, and about 50 families have been left
homeless and doubled up with friends or relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the brunt of the storm,'' said Thomas Hugh, who lives
in the aptly named neighborhood of Hard Bargain. He spent part of
the storm driving people to shelter in his pickup truck. ``I was in
my apartment when the storm was coming, and something said, go,''
he said. ``I drove to my son's house and got him to leave. Ten
minutes later, the roof was gone from his house. We went to the
church for shelter, but even there, part of the roof came off.''
</P>
<P>
   In the resort community of Turtle Cay, residents were still
trying to hack their way through the trees that had blocked their
driveways and fallen on some homes.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Goddard, a businessman from San Diego, had come here to
replace the roof on his vacation home that had been destroyed by
Hurricane Dennis. He and his wife were stranded on the island when
the airport was closed Monday, though he had a plane waiting to
take them home. Instead, they took shelter at a friend's house,
which nonetheless proved frightening when the shutters were torn
off and four people struggled to prop themselves against a mattress
and box spring to blot out the withering winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The roof was heaving like somebody was breathing on it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The question for many residents and business owners now is how
much and how fast can they rebuild. Some said they were hoping for
reduced duties on imported supplies and construction materials, and
easing of restrictions on foreign labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be open for the millennium,'' said David Phillips, who
owns the Bluff House Beach Hotel. ``We have three months. We hope
the government will aid us. To get money to come in, we got to get
tourists to come. If we sit and wait six months, everybody will be
starving. Except the construction workers.''

   JACKSON, Wyo. _ It started with a short letter to a local
newspaper here four months ago, in which a woman from Ketchum,
Idaho, warned Jackson residents that the federal government
intended to build a nuclear incinerator 90 miles upwind from
Jackson and Yellowstone National Park.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, almost no one here knew what she was talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Now, almost no one here does not, and the shift has led to the
latest battle between the Department of Energy and a Western
community determined to stop construction of an incinerator that
some scientists believe will spew radioactive and toxic materials
into the air.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict has a familiar echo in the West as the United
States works to dispose of nuclear and hazardous waste that built
up during 50 years of Cold War weapons research. Federal laws
require that the material be treated and disposed of. Yet, few
communities have been willing to play host to such operations.
</P>
<P>
   Two environmental groups, one of them some Jackson residents who
organized to fight the project, plan to file suit on Friday in U.S.
District Court in Cheyenne, contending that federal laws have been
ignored in allowing plans for the incinerator to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   The groups are seeking an injunction that would block
construction until a more thorough environmental impact study is
completed and circulated for public comment.
</P>
<P>
   The groups _ Keep Yellowstone Nuclear Free and the Environmental
Defense Institute, a watchdog organization in Idaho _ contend that
state officials in Idaho and the federal authorities forged ahead
without properly informing Wyoming residents, without reviewing the
full range of health consequences and without considering a less
threatening means of eliminating the waste.
</P>
<P>
   They also accuse the Energy Department, in planning the
incinerator, of ignoring ``past accidents, mishaps and regulatory
lapses, which have plagued its nuclear waste program and which call
into question its unsupported assurances about the safety of the
incinerator project.''
</P>
<P>
   The groups, which are represented by Gerry L. Spence, a
nationally known lawyer and Wyoming resident, in effect say that
the fix is in and that Wyoming, the nation's least populous state,
with fewer than 500,000 people, can do little to stop the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about the air I breathe, but ideally, this is
not just a matter of what's happening here,'' said Mary Mitchell,
vice president of the ad hoc Jackson group, which has been leading
the opposition to the incinerator. ``I won't really be happy until
they have replaced what I see as antiquated technology with
alternative ways of dealing with nuclear waste.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, community opposition helped thwart proposals to
operate similar incinerators at Rocky Flats, Colo., Los Alamos,
N.M., and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore,
Calif. At Livermore, opponents of an incinerator were aided by the
laboratory's own scientists, who analyzed the proposal and
concluded in 1990 that burning nuclear waste violated `'the
cardinal principle of radioactive waste treatment; namely,
containing radioactivity rather than spreading it.''
</P>
<P>
   But even successful opposition elsewhere has not stalled plans
by the federal government to build an incinerator at the Idaho
National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, a facility the
size of Rhode Island in southern Idaho that would burn much of the
most hazardous nuclear and toxic waste material remaining in the
United States. The material is now stored and buried at the site.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Energy has hired a contractor, British Nuclear
Fuels Ltd., to build the incinerator. Construction on the $1.2
billion project is scheduled to begin once the Idaho Division of
Environmental Quality issues permits that reflect its satisfaction
that state air quality regulations will be met and that disposal
operations will not affect the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Allred, the division administrator, said he would rule on
the permit applications by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of a lawsuit has at least made the federal government
listen. The chief defendant in the suit, Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson, said in an interview that construction of the
incinerator would proceed only if the department is assured that
operations would not jeopardize health and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said he had offered to meet in Washington with Spence
and his clients to hear their concerns, and Spence said that he
welcomed the invitation, but he added that the plaintiffs would
drop their suit only if the Energy Department abandoned plans for
the incinerator.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, the plaintiffs have vowed to press on, based on
their fears that wind patterns would carry hazardous and
radioactive emissions over parts of Wyoming that include Jackson
and the two national parks just north of Jackson, Grand Teton and
Yellowstone.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   They have collected testimony from scientists who contend that
despite all assurances from officials in Idaho and Washington that
a new incinerator would operate safely, some toxic and radioactive
particles would elude even sophisticated filter systems and
contaminate downwind areas.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster their efforts and cover legal costs, they have raised
more than $300,000, with pledges of $200,000 more, reflecting a
rare collaboration in this resort town of 6,000 people, where many
rich and famous people have built second homes. In addition to
small contributions from hundreds of year-round residents, members
of the Yellowstone group said they had received $50,000 each from
Harrison Ford, the actor, and James D. Wolfensohn, president of the
World Bank, who have homes in the Jackson area.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the two plaintiff groups are on the mission almost
alone. Leading Wyoming officials, including Gov. Jim Gehringer and
Sen. Craig Thomas, both Republicans, have asked the Clinton
administration to explain the need for an incinerator, rather than
a containment strategy. But neither the National Park Service nor
politically influential groups in Idaho like the Potato Growers of
Idaho that could be affected by an accident or inefficient
operation, have objected.
</P>
<P>
   Michael V. Finley, superintendent of Yellowstone National Park,
said members of his staff were reviewing impact studies on the park
and discussing pertinent issues with officials from the Idaho
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Duff, executive director of the potato growers group, which
represent hundreds of farmers living near the proposed incinerator
site, said its members were ``comfortable with the activities'' at
the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jackson residents are worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine years after Livermore, and we're still involved in a
redundant effort,'' said Sophia Wakefield, a grocery store owner
here who is a member of the Yellowstone group. ``It seems like such
a waste of time. But we don't want to just stop an incinerator from
being built here. We want to stop it for all time.''

ADVOCATES OF GUN BILLS PLAN TV ADS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Mo., Ky., Ga., Fla., Ill., Minn., Utah)   (bl)  
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Congress locked in a pitched battle over gun
control, a leading advocacy group for tighter restrictions will
show a new series of television advertisements featuring talk-show
host Rosie O'Donnell and actress Susan Sarandon.
</P>
<P>
   The group, Handgun Control Inc., will broadcast 30-second
advertisements in a two-week campaign beginning Friday in the
Washington area, and in nine swing congressional districts Tuesday,
urging viewers to call legislators and demand tougher laws. The
first week of advertisements will cost $100,000, said Naomi Paiss,
a spokeswoman for the group.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was scheduled several days before Wednesday's fatal
shootings at a Fort Worth, Texas, church, Ms. Paiss said. A string
of similar multiple shootings, including one at a Colorado high
school last spring, has galvanized the gun debate on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the new advertisements is meant to coincide with a
final legislative showdown on gun control this year. House and
Senate negotiators are trying to hammer out new legislation, but
lobbyists on both sides see little room for agreement on the
pivotal issue of stricter regulations of gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Handgun Control has run radio spots during the Senate and House
debates on gun bills earlier this year, but the organization
decided to make one last push with television.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to reach as many people as quickly as possible,'' Ms.
Paiss said, explaining the group's first television advertisement
campaign in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Washington, the advertisements will be broadcast in
Charlotte, N.C.; Kansas City, Mo.; Louisville, Ky.; Marietta, Ga.;
Orlando, Fla.; Peoria, Ill.; Rochester, Minn.; Salt Lake City, and
Wilmington, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement draws on video images from three of the recent
multiple shootings: those at the Jewish Community Center in Los
Angeles, Westside Elementary School in Jonesboro, Ark., and
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. Ms. O'Donnell or Ms.
Sarandon intone the list of casualties at each tragedy, before
concluding, ``Enough is enough. No more excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ms. Paiss said the group would broadcast another
set of advertisements beginning this fall, and running off and on
for several months, that are designed to keep the issue on the
public agenda into the Presidential election. The second campaign
will feature voice-overs from celebrities like Whoopi Goldberg,
Reba McIntyre, Bette Midler and Mia Farrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Win or lose with the current package on the Hill, gun control
is going to be one of the hottest issues in the 2000 campaign,''
Ms. Paiss said. ``It's one of the few areas in which neither side
can triangulate.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with its new campaign, Handgun Control's advertising pales
in comparison to efforts of the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   James Jay Baker, chief lobbyist for the organization, said last
month that the NRA would probably spend at least as much money on
lobbying and advertising in the coming months as the $1.5 million
it had poured into the gun control debate since early May.

EDITORIAL: GRASPING THE OBVIOUS PATHOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in editorial for Friday, Sept. 17:
</P>
<P>
   The grim outline of the story is all too familiar: a gunman, a
shooting, the dead, a search for motive and the realization that
once again motive explains little. When the gunfire ended at
Wedgwood Baptist Church in Fort Worth, Texas, Wednesday night, a
familiar chasm opened _ the gap that divides the fact of such a
shooting, and all the shootings it brings to mind, from the ability
to account for it.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the shootings that have taken place over the last few
months, in Atlanta, in Los Angeles, in Littleton, Colo., and
elsewhere, begin to look less and less like distinct events and
more and more like the recurrence of a single event, which leaves
behind the taste of ashes and a mental numbness. Every shooting is
troubling, but the ones that bother us most are the dispassionate,
seemingly causeless ones. They mock our desire for explanation.
</P>
<P>
   The language of disease naturally springs to mind again after
the Fort Worth incident. This is part of an epidemic of copycat
shootings, you hear it said, an epidemic that reflects a deep
sickness in our society. The faith that a kind of pathology is at
work suggests that there is also a chance of finding a cause, in
society or in the individual, as virulent and specific as a
microscopic pathogen.
</P>
<P>
   This analogy fails to consider the diversity and elusiveness of
human behavior, the degrees of rationality and irrationality that
ordinary human society admits. There will always be those whose
rage and imbalance, whose disease, in fact, leads them to violence.
Perhaps the tendency to violence is increased by this society's
remarkable ability to mirror itself through the media and, at the
same time, to isolate individuals.
</P>
<P>
   But there is only one overriding pathology, and it is guns. If
we were not so mired in political intransigence, so wearyingly
familiar with the arguments and counter-arguments for responsible,
regulated gun ownership, we would be able to see what almost any
citizen from an unarmed country sees quite plainly _ that on the
subject of guns this nation suffers from parochial delusions. A
handgun is not a tool for defending democracy. It is, increasingly,
a symbol of fearful individualism, an emblem of resistance to this
democracy itself.
</P>
<P>
   It is always tempting to blame society when a man like Larry
Gene Ashbrook opens fire. ``Society'' is so amorphous that it can
be blamed for anything. But in its present state, in its reluctance
to disarm itself or even to impose meaningful gun control, society
can indeed be blamed. If we asserted our freedom as ferociously as
we assert the right to defend our freedom with firearms, we could
at least restore the balance of power between a church full of
young people and a lone, deranged man who wanders into their
midst. &QL;

<P>
   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ The heart of Hurricane Floyd raked across the
mainland here at Cape Fear Thursday morning, uprooting beach houses
and leaving widespread floods as it set a rapid but steadily
weakening course up the Atlantic coast.
</P>
<P>
   The vast storm, whose advent alarmed much of the Eastern
seaboard and widely disrupted air, rail and highway travel, was
clearly losing its power with the dawn Thursday as the hurricane's
eye danced across the coastline following a two-week buildup of the
forces of nature and the precautions of government.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday evening, as Floyd reached northeastward along the
New Jersey coast to New York City, its strength had further waned.
It was downgraded to a tropical storm that still delivered lashing
rain but that officials said presented no major threat to New York
or other population centers.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 deaths were attributed to Floyd. Seven people died
in traffic in the Carolinas and Virginia and two girls in Delaware
drowned after a storm-swollen creek swept them into a sewage pipe.
One man was presumed drowned in the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   In the howling predawn of this coastal city, Floyd's power was
measured to be dropping from a Category 4 to a Category 2 hurricane
before dropping further to a tropical storm. While storm-drenched
hurricane veterans were delighted after all the ominous evacuation
warnings that it delivered far less physical injury and property
destruction than originally feared, Floyd nevertheless proved
relentlessly drenching, dropping as much as 19 inches of rain in
some areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were blessed this time,'' Fire Chief Keith Studt said as he
roamed flooded streets and hacked away at fallen trees cluttering
the streets of nearby Winter Park. ``We were lucky this thing
suddenly ratcheted down before it hit town.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the flooding and house damage out on Oak Island and
other coastal barrier islands was considerable as the storm headed
unpredictably northward, causing further disruption across a wide
swath of the seaboard. Residents emerged uncertainly here from
emergency centers to blink at piles of suddenly sun-dappled debris.
By then Floyd was speeding up along the coast by Virginia,
Chesapeake Bay and the New Jersey shore.
</P>
<P>
   It lost further power but still spewed fresh damage along its
western flank as the storm was described as fading into a rough
course aimed toward eastern Long Island. But travel turmoil was
widespread during the day and quickly became bumper to bumper
around Washington, as a truck overturned on the storm-lashed
Chesapeake Bay Bridge and blocked one of the major regional
arteries.
</P>
<P>
   On St. Michael's, a resort and retirement village on an
elbowlike peninsula reaching into Chesapeake Bay, the day's rain
and winds started turning savage in midafternoon as the eye of the
storm approached.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Murphy is a netter, who fishes with nets attached to
poles. He left two, $10,000 polenets standing in the bay, where he
assumed they would be safe from a northeaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's coming from the northwest,'' Murphy said. He said his
nets had withstood 40-mph winds. ``But this was 60 or 70,'' he
said, figuring his rigs were lost. ``The netters are caught real
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The storm's eye loomed out of the Atlantic's 30-foot seas as a
somewhat tentative invader, avoiding a deep inland attack and
cutting across Cape Fear at 3:20 a.m. to begin a rapid ride up the
coastline. Open relief at the turning was the reaction from this
storm-hardened city, which has had to batten down for five
hurricanes in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was merciful that it didn't come through at the 155 mph
they were first talking about,'' said James Blanton, hitching his
pickup truck's chain to a tree fallen across the road to his
granddaughter's house. ``That's what saved us, even with all this
flooding.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, the storm registered sustained winds of 98 mph that
gusted up to 130, tearing up the roof of the Brunswick County
Hospital to the south. There was some roof damage as well to
Wilmington's historic Cotton Exchange building, which is now a
shopping mall centerpiece.
</P>
<P>
   One unnerving accident was the draining of 2 million gallons
from a hog waste lagoon into the Northeast Cape Fear River, about
40 miles to the north.
</P>
<P>
   But otherwise the storm caused minimal structural damage here,
as in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The old buildings of downtown Charleston shrugged off lashing
wind and rain, as many have there for two centuries. ``These old
houses have seen a lot worse,'' said Park Smith, wielding a saw to
create fresh firewood from a fallen tree near South Battery Street.
</P>
<P>
   Charleston suffered little more than $10 million in damage,
according to the county director of building services, Carl
Simmons. ``Very, very minor,'' he declared. Other residents said
Floyd would be remembered for the convoys of rain-slickered
television anchormen who hit the beaches more than for the actual
glancing blow the storm delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Down the coast in Myrtle Beach, S.C., wind damage was minimal
but flooding was severe along the coastal Grand Strand. Safety
workers had to deal with snakes fleeing to dry ground and drivers
determined to ford passages left obviously risky with coursing
flood water. National Guardsmen audibly cursed one driver who
ventured blithely ever deeper into a flooded crossing in his pickup
truck. Suddenly, the driver, his wife and daughter had to be
rescued when the truck was swept away.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he made the attempt, the driver, Ralph Elem,
personified the sense of happy adventure that seemed part of the
local post-hurricane mood. ``For the heck of it,'' Elem replied.
``Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   The main effect here from Floyd was a relentless 34-hour record
rainfall of 19.06 inches that spilled beyond drainage ditches,
flooded houses and blocked major crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen water like this,'' said Donald Squires as he
paddled in a rowboat down the road to his house, which he found
sitting high and mostly dry in outlying Delco. ``This sure ain't
another Hazel, not the way my father always talked,'' he said of
the 1954 hurricane that set this city's benchmark for death and
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   As he roamed in the sunlight that followed the storm, Fire Chief
Studt was openly grateful that Floyd never lived up to the advance
billing. ''But, hey, we got another one coming next week,'' he
quickly added, his eye out for an evolving storm called Gert.

 &HT;    Report acknowledges `many gifts'
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Griffin Bell's revised report to Congress attempts to
provide a more complete picture of the extreme means the Atlanta
Olympic bid team used to land the 1996 Centennial Games.
</P>
<P>
   He said the original report, signed by Atlanta bid chairman
Billy Payne and former Mayor Andrew Young, was incomplete because
they didn't have much time to pull it together.
</P>
<P>
   Payne said Thursday his report was not intended to be
comprehensive. ``It was a best effort by a lot of good folks in a
short period of time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The revised report contains no evidence that Atlanta's bid
activity was as excessive as that of the Salt Lake City team. But,
in a letter to two congressional committees, he wrote, ``What the
evidence does show is that Atlanta volunteers gave many gifts and
were eager to accommodate IOC members.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is a breakdown of Bell's conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Gifts and shopping
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic culture of gift-giving has raised more eyebrows and
received more criticism than any other aspect of the lobbying
process. It's a system former Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell labeled ``gift creep.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell headed an ethics commission that investigated the Salt
Lake City scandal and came to the conclusion that the city's
misconduct was ``part of a broader culture of improper gift-giving
in which candidate cities provided things of value to IOC members
in an effort to buy their votes.''
</P>
<P>
   It was clear from Bell's report that this culture was alive and
flourishing in Atlanta. And it was vastly underreported in Payne
and Young's initial account to Congress. In that report, they
identified 38 gifts valued at more than the $200 limit set by the
IOC.
</P>
<P>
   In his research, Bell found a total of 64, including a $948
carburetor kit for the Libyan member, $318 in antique surgical
instruments for the now-deceased IOC member from Cameroon and a
$365 antique compass for the member from Denmark. Steuben glass,
china and crystal sculptures were common gifts.
</P>
<P>
   These gifts were ``carefully selected to please the tastes of an
individual IOC member or that member's relatives or friends,'' Bell
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said two of the gifts may have been illegal. A live bulldog
and a carburetor to the IOC delegates from Cuba and Libya,
respectively, may have violated a U.S. embargo on both countries.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, the report acknowledged for the first time the
shopping sprees in which IOC members and their wives were escorted
through the city's malls and upscale specialty stores to collect an
assortment of gifts _ paid for by their hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Payne and Young denied knowledge of ``shopping sprees'' in their
original report to Congress, just as they denied them when such
rumors first emerged in the German press in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   One such shopping spree for Agustin Arroyo and his wife from
Ecuador netted $331 in trinkets such as a belt, makeup, sewing
supplies, drugstore items and toys. The Smirnovs of Russia took
home $861 in clothing, makeup, sporting goods and a sports jacket
after two visits to the city and two shopping trips, compliments of
the bid team. Pirjo Haggman of Finland received $1,300 in clothing,
makeup, toys and books in one visit with her husband and children.
And the list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Other accommodations
</P>
<P>
   The bid team was nothing if not accommodating. It acknowledged
providing help to IOC members seeking business opportunities, visas
for entry into the country and used MARTA buses for one country.
</P>
<P>
   Two bid team members carried $15,500 in cash into the United
States from Jamaica at the behest of the IOC member from that
country. The members divided the cash between them to avoid having
to declare the money to U.S. Customs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody asked us to do a favor, we would do it,'' Bell
said. ``We were trying to get votes. That was what we were trying
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Consultants
</P>
<P>
   Dick Angell, a member of the unsuccessful Anchorage bid team,
provided dossiers on the IOC members, which detailed their personal
likes and dislikes and strategies for winning their votes. His
profiles, paid for by the Atlanta bid team, provided the more
salacious material about the membership, including whose vote could
be bought with sexual favors.
</P>
<P>
   The bid group paid his firm $19,321 for his services but said it
never made use of the information on sex
</P>
<P>
   Health care
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic bid team offered medical services to IOC members and
their relatives at some of Atlanta's premier health care facilities
as a means of attracting them to the city, Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, hospitals and doctors provided free services for
the foreign visitors. In other cases, the bid team picked up the
tab, although Bell's letter inexplicably said the group never
incurred any expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the services were not identified in the original report,
including $93.48 for medication for the IOC member from Swaziland.
David Sibandze, who was forced to resign from the IOC for favors
received from the Salt Lake City committee, also received free
emergency care after he suffered a heart attack during a visit.
</P>
<P>
   Another hospital treated without charge an infection for the son
of the IOC member from Algeria. And Payne's private physician twice
provided a medical examination for Vitaly Smirnov.
</P>
<P>
   The bid team offered much more, although the records indicated
no evidence the offers were accepted, according to Bell.
</P>
<P>
   It offered to fly the IOC member from Libya _ Bashir
Attarabulsi, who also has resigned _ to Atlanta for medical
treatment. There were offers of trips for treatment at the Emory
Medical Clinic for the now-deceased IOC member from Morocco and his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake City team also came under fire for paying for
medical treatment and cosmetic surgery for various IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   Employment opportunities
</P>
<P>
   Bell acknowledged that Payne's bid team was ``eager to
facilitate'' the job hunting efforts of the children of IOC
members.
</P>
<P>
   The report details seven instances of providing letters of
recommendation, arranging interviews and offering referrals that
could lead to employment for offspring.
</P>
<P>
   The assistance ranged from securing a job offer from
then-Citizens &AMP; Southern bank for the son of Congolese delegate
Jean-Claude Ganga, who has been expelled, to arranging a job offer
at a Vail ski resort for Smirnov's son.
</P>
<P>
   ``We helped people who wanted a job, but as far as we can tell
from the record, we never got anybody a job,'' Bell said. ``We
tried.''
</P>
<P>
   Athletic training
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers were most concerned in the wake of the original report
about athletic scholarships and training provided to three
teen-agers from Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The bid team had acknowledged spending $9,145 for a swimmer from
Mauritius to live in Atlanta and train at the Dynamo Swim Club. It
also spent $14,583 to send two young tennis players from the Congo,
at Ganga's behest, to an exclusive camp in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In the new report, the bid group acknowledged making additional
offers to assist foreign athletes, which apparently were declined.
It did help some athletes obtain financial assistance for training
from other sources.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a request by Ivan Dibos of Peru, the bidders
helped a team of cyclists and a shooter obtain entry into a U.S.
Olympic Committee training program.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were athletes who needed training,'' Bell said. ``That's
one of the things Olympic bidders are encouraged to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports equipment
</P>
<P>
   The initial report described a gift of sports equipment for the
School and University Games in the Congo. The collection, which
included everything from soccer balls to T-shirts and shorts, cost
bidders $20,633.
</P>
<P>
   They also reported earlier of facilitating the donation of a
$10,000 scoreboard for the National Sports Stadium in the Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The new report added that 1,500 pairs of shoes were supplied to
participants in the Games. And the bid team discussed with Ganga
about donating track clothing to the Congo Sports Ministry and
providing sports equipment grants to ``all African national Olympic
committees.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers could find no evidence that the grants were made
</P>
<P>
   Scholastic assistance
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most controversial favors offered in the Olympic
scandal were scholarships and other college assistance. The
discovery of Salt Lake City's $400,000 college scholarship program
for the children of IOC members touched off the influence-peddling
scandal last November.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bell said he found no evidence that scholarships were
provided to IOC members or their relatives in Atlanta, they were
certainly offered _ contrary to what bid team officials said
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The new report said bid team officials promised to secure
scholarships for some students and assisted others in gaining
admission to U.S. universities.
</P>
<P>
   Young pitched a scholarship to Georgia Tech to the daughter of
General Henry Edmund Adefope of Nigeria, and another bid team
member offered a tennis scholarship to the University of Georgia
for the daughter of Pal Schmitt of Hungary. Neither apparently
accepted the offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not give a scholarship,'' Bell said. ``But we offered
scholarships.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell acknowledged the bid team's effort in gaining admission to
Tech and setting up an apartment for the son of Ram Ruhee of
Mauritius, and assisting the son of Paul Wallwork of Western Samoa
gain admission to the University of Michigan to wrestle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two instances where we helped people get in Georgia
schools after the Olympics were awarded,'' Bell added.
</P>
<P>
   Travel
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably more abuses in travel than anywhere,'' said
Bell, ``but it was not the Atlanta group's abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell cited the IOC delegates' practice of requesting round-trip
tickets to Atlanta and to Toronto, another bid city, for visits
during the same time period. They would cash in one, take a
connecting flight between the cities and pocket the difference.
</P>
<P>
   He said he also found 10 instances where the bid group
reimbursed an IOC member who visited Atlanta for airfare with cash,
check or wire payment, but where no documentation could be found.
</P>
<P>
   While the IOC rules limited members to one visit to a candidate
city, Atlanta's strategy relied heavily on encouraging them to
visit the city and other locales. And, apparently, to visit often.
Many members made multiple trips and brought the family with them.
</P>
<P>
   Every member was invited to Disney World during the bid, and
many took Atlanta up on the offer. The exuberant bid team promoted
the potential for IOC families to visit attractions throughout the
South should Atlanta win the Games, although the program was never
implemented due to a money crunch. Nor was a plan to send all
athletes to Disney after their competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many IOC members played golf at the Augusta National Golf
Club, rested at The Cloister at Sea Island, cruised on Malcolm
Forbes' yacht in Savannah and attended University of Georgia
football games in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   They flew first class or in private corporate or state-owned
aircraft, stayed in luxury hotels and were chaffeured in private
cars. The bidders happily paid for visits to other cities once they
had the IOC members on the continent. Records show trips to Boston,
New York, Washington and Coral Gables, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   On several occasions, the bid team paid for plane tickets for
the children of Ganga from the Congo. They flew his two daughters
from Atlanta to Montreal and his two sons on a three-stop junket
between Atlanta, Montreal and Toronto. They also picked up a $2,663
tab for the Ganga family's two-night stay in a New York City hotel.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the bid team spent $15,702 on hotels and airfare for
Ganga, the most egregious violater in the Salt Lake scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of these trips went unrecorded in the bid team's original
report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Payne, who co-signed the first report, said he believes the
revision is complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope and believe the report Judge Bell has submitted to the
Commerce committee,'' Payne said, ``fully and finally represents
the record of the bid activities of the Atlanta campaign to win the
1996 Games.''

SHOOTING VICTIMS GONE IN BODY, BUT THEIR SPIRITS REMAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB RAY SANDERS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Once upon a time there were safe places for
our children outside their homes.
</P>
<P>
   We could actually look away from them, turn our backs and even
leave them for a while, trusting that they would still be there _
unharmed _ once we returned.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, those secure places began to disappear, and we were
suddenly faced with the constant, haunting fear that every good-bye
just might be the last.
</P>
<P>
   Demented souls have begun to prowl our neighborhoods, trespass
on our kids' playgrounds, invade their schools and now even
desecrate their churches.
</P>
<P>
   Is there no refuge left?
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when churches were held in such great esteem,
even by crazy criminals, that no one dared violate them.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, we've seen the respect for these sacred havens
dwindle away. The signs have been appearing for some time.
</P>
<P>
   First came the petty thefts of church property. Then major
thefts of vehicles and air-conditioning units.
</P>
<P>
   Fences began to pop up around church vans.
</P>
<P>
   Many churches, and members of their congregations, have been the
victims of armed robberies during, and after, the Sunday worship
service.
</P>
<P>
   I shall never forget that sickening feeling when I first saw
armed security guards patrolling church grounds. Now, of course, it
is a common sight.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, religious institutions have become major
targets of arsonists and vandals, who apparently get some kind of
weird gratification from their perverted, destructive acts.
</P>
<P>
   And, yet, although their vile transgressions destroyed property,
and in some cases, human life, they have not been able to murder
the spirit.
</P>
<P>
   For the spirit, you see, there is a refuge, and it's not inside
the walls of a sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that the young people and the adults attending
services at Fort Worth's Wedgwood Baptist Church on Wednesday night
understood that as well as anyone.
</P>
<P>
   While my heart cries for those who died, my soul rejoices for
their spirits.
</P>
<P>
   I grieve for, and with, their families, for although I did not
know them personally, they were my brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   For me _ and for many others in Fort Worth _ there has been a
death in the family ... our family.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, let us pause to remember them:
</P>
<P>
   Shawn C. Brown, 23
</P>
<P>
   Susan Kimberly Jones, 23
</P>
<P>
   Cassandra Griffin, 14
</P>
<P>
   Joseph D. Ennis, 14
</P>
<P>
   Justin M. Ray, 17
</P>
<P>
   Sydney R. Browning, 36
</P>
<P>
   Kristi Beckel, 14.
</P>
<P>
   Their lives have been taken from us, but because they are our
soulmates, we shall cherish their memories forever.

HOW MUCH COVERAGE IS ENOUGH, AND HOW MUCH IS TOO MUCH?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ WFAA-TV/Channel 8 continued to sink its
teeth into the Wedgwood shooting story early Thursday, giving
updates and filing reports as its competitors yielded to regularly
scheduled programming.
</P>
<P>
   Channel 8 pre-empted ``Good Morning America'' and took advantage
of the hour reserved for the locally produced ``Good Morning
Texas,'' shelving the happy-face infotainment format in favor of a
somber-looking Carmen Aimsworth and Janette Smith anchoring from a
news desk.
</P>
<P>
   But as news organizations shifted to the second-day phase _
asking why a gunmen walked into a church and opened fire _ the
question for Channel 8 and its surprisingly average performance
was: Where was anchor John McCaa?
</P>
<P>
   On vacation in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   With Gloria Campos returning from a speaking engagement as the
story broke, morning and midday anchor Scott Sams was handed the
bulk of the anchor duties.
</P>
<P>
   Sams was somewhat flustered yet servicable. But there's
something uneasy about going into battle without the heaviest
artillery.
</P>
<P>
   Channel 8 remains the most-watched station, with KXAS-TV/Channel
5 nipping at its heels. With former anchor Tracy Rowlett awaiting a
Jan. 1 on-camera start at KTVT/Channel 11 and Chip Moody still
recovering from illness, Sams has joined McCaa and Campos in the
station's traditional three-prong anchor attack.
</P>
<P>
   First-day coverage is where TV news usually trips over itself in
trying to get too much on the air too fast. Day Two is where it has
faced criticisms of crossing the line from getting the story to
exploiting it. (Channel 5 didn't hesitate to air the frantic 911
call, for instance.)
</P>
<P>
   Channels 8, 5 and 11, KDFW/Channel 4 and newcomer KDAF/Channel
33 dispatched reporters to various schools, hoping to get some kind
of reaction. Schools weren't letting them in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us in the newsroom are parents,'' said Channel 8 News
Director David Duitch. ``And the golden rule is to insert your kid
as the victim and ask how would you feel as a parent. We want to be
careful. We don't want to cross that line. Does it happen
sometimes? Yes. But it's not intentional.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the glory and the nemesis of TV news. Newspapers
basically operate on a once-a-day cycle. TV news, under routine
conditions, shortens that to roughly five hours, the times
separating their morning, noon and evening news programs.
</P>
<P>
   But on big stories, the reporting is continuous if need be with
each station looking for exclusive ``updates,'' even when no such
material exists.
</P>
<P>
   The result, as we've noticed in only two days of coverage, is
that old information is re-spun to seem new, raw information is
telecast before it has been pinned down, and stories are rushed on
the air without independent checking.
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, CNN and MSNBC have been noticably more
measured and balanced on this fevered story _ but its laid-back
approach could point out a troubling sign.
</P>
<P>
   With a hurricane bearing down on the East Coast, the networks
and even CNN have made the Wedgwood shooting a lower priority. News
judgment is in itself a judgment call. Do you cover those already
dead or those who could die?
</P>
<P>
   Or are multiple killings now simply passe?

TEXAS GUNMAN LINKED TO ANTI-HATE GROUP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By EVAN MOORE 
and JIM HENDERSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Larry Ashbrook, the gunman who killed seven
people and himself at a Baptist church Wednesday, identified
himself three years ago as a member of a small, violent group that
advocates killing Jews and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   While police Thursday said they had found no link between the
47-year-old gunman and hate groups, John Craig, co-author of an
academic study of such groups, said Ashbrook in 1996 boasted of
membership in the Phineas Priests.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said that organization was outraged at Southern Baptists
for their efforts to convert Jews to Christianity. At the time of
the church shooting, Baptist churches in Fort Worth were openly
praying for Jewish conversions during the High Holy Days of Rosh
Hashana and Yom Kippur.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses to the shooting spree at the Wedgwood Baptist Church
said Ashbrook spewed obscenities and ridiculed the Baptist
denomination before opening fire on 150 teen-agers and adults
attending a youth rally. Ashbrook shot 14 people before committing
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   He also detonated a homemade pipe bomb, but it apparently
resulted in no injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard about the shootings Wednesday night and I heard
that the gunman was wearing black and killed himself, I knew it had
to be a Phineas Priest,'' said Craig, whose book, ``Soldiers of
God, White Supremacists and their Holy War for America,'' appeared
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called some people I know in the white supremacist movement
and they told me it was Larry Ashbrook.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig said he attempted to notify Fort Worth police of
Ashbrook's racist connections and the possible motive for the
shootings Wednesday night, but his telephone calls were not
returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is that this is the tip of the iceberg,'' he said.
``There are other Phineas Priests out there and they feed off one
another's actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Phineas Priest members linked to violence include Buford
Furrow, who allegedly shot children in a Los Angeles Jewish day
care center, fugitive Eric Rudolph, the abortion center bomber also
accused in the 1996 Olympic Park bombing in Atlanta, and three men
arrested in a string of bank robberies and bombings in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, a former undercover operative and private investigator
who lives in Houston, said he considers members of the group among
the most dangerous because of their willingness to die in the
process of killing Jews, people of color or anyone who aids those
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are extremely violent loners who don't particularly want
to draw attention to themselves except in death,'' Craig said. ``.
. .He (Ashbrook) obviously had no intention of coming back. He
intended to kill himself and become a martyr to his own kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Acting Fort Worth Police Chief Ralph Mendoza on Thursday said
authorities had found no link between Ashbrook and hate groups.
But, police and the 47-year-old gunman's neighbors described him as
hostile and paranoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't like you looking at him,'' said Steve Singer, a
neighbor who frequently passed Ashbrook's house in his car. ``I
would always wave to him and sometimes he would wave back and
sometimes he would just glare at me.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to harass the kids . . .verbally,'' said Karen Ivy,
who lived two doors down the street. ``He'd yell at them and flip
them off. When they got older, he quit doing that 'cause they
wouldn't take it. One day my son, Robert, and some others had the
car radio on and Larry came down and said, `Turn that crap off.'
Robert told him to get back to his house and stay there.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ashbrook's most open animosity apparently was directed at
Jack and Nita Hord, who lived across the street.
</P>
<P>
   One day, Ivy said, Hord and some other neighbors were sitting on
Hord's front steps, laughing. Ashbrook drove up and, thinking they
were laughing at him, yelled, ``What are you laughing at?''
</P>
<P>
   Then he unzipped his pants and exposed himself to the women.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of the neighbors had lived near him for several
years, they knew little about him. He always wore blue jeans, a
white shirt and a gray windbreaker, they said. Usually he carried a
blue canvas tote bag. His beard, they said, was always
``scraggly.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the neighbors knew of any particular religious beliefs
held by Ashbrook, who lived with his father, described as a quiet,
religious man who drove a bus for a nearby Church of Christ.
Ashbrook's father, 85-year-old Jack D. Ashbrook, died July 20, and
Mendoza speculated that could have contributed to his mental
deterioration.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said Ashbrook's father supported him.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said the only contact Fort Worth police had had with
Ashbrook was in 1971, when they arrested him for possession of
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Police, who searched the house late Wednesday night and Thursday
morning, said they found freshly cut sections of pipe, end caps,
fuse and gunpowder and pamphlets pertaining to religion. However,
there was nothing to suggest his attitude toward religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing he wrote were old items, as far back as the
1980s,'' said Mendoza. ``It was complaints about people, his job.
He believed people were out to get him.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer, Ashbrook wrote at least two letters to the Fort
Worth Star-Telegram in which he detailed encounters with the
Central Intelligence Agency, assaults by co-workers and being
drugged by police.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said the inside of Ashbrook's tidy frame house had been
trashed with a crowbar and shovel. The toilets had been destroyed
by pouring cement into them.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said Ashbrook had been armed with two firearms. A
.380-caliber handgun had been purchased in February 1992 at a Fort
Worth gun shop, now out of business; the second weapon, a 9mm Ruger
semiautomatic handgun, had been purchased at a flea market in the
Dallas suburb of Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   One witness, Danny Rojas, said he and other adults were standing
in a room across the hall from the sanctuary when they heard
popping sounds which they thought was hammering from ongoing
construction work.
</P>
<P>
   But then a church employee came up and said he had been shot.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas said he went into the hallway where there was smoke
lingering from shots fired before Ashbrook went into the sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas said he looked through a window into the sanctuary where
his 13-year-old daughter was attending the rally and saw Ashbrook
``walking back and forth, shooting and reloading.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him sit down and get back up and walk around some
more.''
</P>
<P>
   He said at one point Ashbrook turned in his direction and raised
his gun. Rojas ducked out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't go in. There was no way of stopping him,'' Rojas
said.
</P>
<P>
   When the gunman walked in the other direction, Rojas rushed over
to a friend, Sydney R. Browning, 36, who was slumped against the
wall in a pool of blood in the foyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get to her. I thought I could help her, but when I
saw how he had shot her, I knew it was no use.'' She had been shot
through the head.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas said he then ran upstairs to check on his first-grade son.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said this all took only a few minutes, but it seemed a
lot longer than that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said police found at least 10 magazine clips and 30
spent shell casings on the church floor.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses at the church reported that Ashbrook was cursing
Baptists intermittently during his shooting spree and continued the
diatribe as he sat in a back pew and turned one of his weapons on
himself.
</P>
<P>
   According to statements they gave police, he said, ``This
religion is (expletive) and I can't believe you believe this
junk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It all fits too well,'' said Craig.
</P>
<P>
   A question that remained unanswered Thursday was how and why
Ashbrook chose Wedgwood Baptist as his target. The church was the
scene of a gathering of about 150 youths in the school prayer
movement known as ``See You at the Pole,'' a reference to a
schoolyard flagpole.
</P>
<P>
   The church is not on any main thoroughfare, however, and
Ashbrook was not a member.
</P>
<P>
   As to speculation that Ashbrook was angry at the Southern
Baptist Church for reaching out to Jews, one Wedgwood Baptist
member said that would not explain why he targeted her church.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's every Baptist church's mission,'' said Cindy Hoak, 18.
``The whole Southern Baptist Conference is doing the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Robertson, 13, said she has been a member of the
church for two years and, ``We never really talked about Jews at
all.''

CLINTON IS SENDING 200 TROOPS FOR EAST TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the second time in three months, President
Clinton announced that the United States would contribute soldiers
to a peacekeeping force in a troubled spot thousands of miles away,
dispatching 200 troops to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike those in Kosovo, these troops will not be responsible
for combat, but for intelligence, logistics, communication and
transport.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in the Roosevelt Room of the White House Thursday,
Clinton said the United States had political and moral interests at
stake in bringing peace and order to East Timor, even though an
overseas deployment will add to concerns in Congress and the
Pentagon that the armed forces were stretched too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indonesia's future is important to us,'' Clinton said, ``not
only because of its resources and its sea lanes, but for its
potential as a leader in the region and the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In consultations with Congress, the administration emphasized
that the countries of the region, rather than the United States,
would carry the main responsibility for the military operation and
that American forces would be small and restricted to noncombat
specialties.
</P>
<P>
   The administration will also consider enlarging the contingent
if Australia finds that it needs added help, a spokesman for the
Pentagon, Kenneth Bacon, said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the American role is small, especially compared to
the operation in Bosnia and Kosovo, it can still strain the
military, because each deployment requires so many additional
support and relief troops.
</P>
<P>
   The first Australian troops are expected to arrive in Dili by
the weekend, according to Vice Adm. Scott Fry of the Navy, a senior
official on the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   Fry said although American soldiers would be ready to move in 48
hours, they did not expect their orders to deploy until the
Australians had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that effort, American aircraft will help the other
nations transport heavy equipment to Darwin, Australia, now the
staging base. Later, the Air Force could transport equipment in
C-5, C-17 and C-130 transports to Dili, the East Timor capital, and
if necessary, help fly in troops.
</P>
<P>
   When deployed, fewer than 100 American troops are to be
stationed on the ground in East Timor.

HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS SLOSH THEIR WAY HOME 

</HEADLINE>

and STEVE BREWER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ Once a mighty hurricane, Tropical Storm Floyd
sloshed through the Northeast with heavy rains and gusty winds
Thursday after triggering widespread flooding, but relatively
little damage along the North Carolina coast where it rolled ashore
in the early morning hours.
</P>
<P>
   As hundreds of thousands who evacuated coastal communities from
Florida to Virginia started to return to their homes, those in the
path of the storm's northward march faced closed schools, shuttered
shops and canceled airline flights. Officials in Delaware,
Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Virginia declared states of
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 deaths were blamed on Floyd, seven from traffic
accidents in the Carolinas and Virginia. Two girls in Delaware
drowned after a storm-swollen creek swept them into a sewage pipe,
and one man was presumed drowned in the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   But state and federal officials expressed relief that Floyd,
which at one point in its short life was one of the biggest
hurricanes ever to threaten the U.S. coast, appeared to pull its
punches just before landfall near Cape Fear, N.C., and caused
minimal damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're most fortunate,'' said George Lemons, a National Weather
Service forecaster in Raleigh, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton freed more than $500 million Thursday for
victims of Hurricane Floyd and defended the mass evacuation of
coastal areas in the Southeast, calling it a ``terrific test.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than flooding, which was widespread throughout the state,
what damage Floyd caused to property appeared to be minimal and
limited to the coastal areas near where it came ashore. Power
outages affecting hundreds of thousands of people were endemic
throughout the areas affected by the storm.
</P>
<P>
   At its strongest Monday, Floyd was a Category 5 hurricane with
maximum winds of 155 mph. When it crossed the coast early Thursday,
it was a minimal, Category 2 storm with winds of 110 mph. After
picking up speed and racing northward, Floyd, with winds of around
65 mph, was downgraded to a tropical storm near Atlantic City,
N.J., in the early evening.
</P>
<P>
   After traversing North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware
and New Jersey on Thursday, then into New York's Long Island, the
considerably weakened storm is expected to glide off the continent
back into the Atlantic Ocean at Cape Cod in Massachusetts late
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Nudged along by a low pressure system, the storm's northeasterly
motion accelerated to nearly 30 miles per hour as it scaled the
mid-Atlantic Coast, lashing Washington, D. C., with heavy winds and
rain, and bearing down on New York City and Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``The projected track of the storm is essentially off the East
Coast of Long Island, up off of Cape Cod and then to Novia
Scotia,'' said Frank Lepore, a spokesman for the National Hurricane
Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the higher latitudes, these storms tend to move across the
surface very quickly, so it becomes a rapidly deteriorating
event,'' said Lepore. ``It loses its nice cyclonic form. It just
becomes an amorphous blob of rain.''
</P>
<P>
   Rainfall amounts of 5 to 7 inches were predicted along the path
of the storm.
</P>
<P>
   In all, about 2.6 million people from Florida to North Carolina
were ordered to leave their homes in what officials described as
the largest evacuation ever for a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, the path of destruction caused by Hurricane
Floyd along the state's southeastern coast was not the typical
house-smashing variety. Rather the storm deluged the state with
record amounts of rain, flooding major interstates and low-lying
areas as far inland as the Raleigh-Durham area.
</P>
<P>
   Four people were confirmed dead, including a Department of
Transportation worker who stopped to help a stranded motorist in
Trenton on Thursday. The worker, whose name was not released,
apparently stepped just a few inches off the road and was swept
away in rushing water. His body was recovered in 12-foot deep
water.
</P>
<P>
   Ten coastal counties were under dusk-to-dawn curfews Thursday
night. While authorities in most of the counties were issuing only
citations to violators, some were detaining them.
</P>
<P>
   State officials estimated the flood damage would be just as
costly as it would be if Floyd had flattened the coast. Several
inland rivers were expected to crest Friday and Saturday, and were
expected to set new flooding records.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flooding is going to do more damage,'' said Andy James, a
spokesman for the North Carolina Division of Emergency Management.
``Most people associate a hurricane with it coming in and blowing
down a house. We didn't have much of that. But we are flooded.''
</P>
<P>
   Assessment teams across the coastal area had not been able to
fully tally the damage late Thursday because flooded roads
prevented entry to most beaches from Surf City to the South
Carolina border.
</P>
<P>
   Besides some coastal roads, two major interstates were closed in
areas because of inland floodin. James said I-95 was closed in
both directions near Halifax and near Wilson. Interstate-40, the
main route for evacuees returning to Wilmington, was closed in both
directions at spots in New Hanover County and in Pender County.
</P>
<P>
   Officials ordered more than 500,000 people to leave the coastal
area before Floyd struck about 3 a.m. EST Thursday. About 37,000
were staying in shelters throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   By daybreak the storm had passed and many were trying to return
home. While some made it before the road closures, many were forced
to turn around or take routes that added several hours to their
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic jams were reported along most of the alternate routes.
The back-ups were causing problems for power crews trying to get to
the coast where 600,000 remained without electricity Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see that number going down any time soon simply
because of the high water on the roads,'' James said. ``The repair
crews can't get to the areas.''
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen ``Push Packages,'' teams of six National Guardsmen
and three state forestry employees in two Humvees and a
two-and-a-half ton truck, were charged with scouring the area to
perform search and rescue missions as well as clear fallen trees
and debris from roadways.
</P>
<P>
   State emergency management spokesman Robert Carver said the
teams, formed recently in the state in the wake of past hurricanes,
were concentrating on clearing roadways so power and sewage crews
can repair broken lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is flooding everywhere,'' Carver said. ``We're going to
get out there as soon as we can. Our priority today is to get the
roads open and make sure critical facilities are operable.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one hospital was forced to close as the storm rushed
through, Carver said. An estimated 50,000 square feet of roof caved
in at the Brunswick County Hospital early Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Most state and county roads leading to the beaches in Brunswick
County at the South Carolina border were covered with standing and
rushing water in various spots. While most of the areas were
passable, every road had at least one impassable spot where water
lapped across at six to eight feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   Residents who evacuated the day before lined the shoulders and
packed parking lots of closed convenience stores as they waited in
frustration for the water to subside so they could return home.
</P>
<P>
   On the beaches near Wilmington the sea surged about 6 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't dodge anything,'' said New Hanover County spokesman
Mark Boyer. ``We took a direct hit. Luckily it started to break up
before it hit land. The amount of damage is significantly less than
what a category four storm would have done.''
</P>
<P>
   At Topsail Island residents were turned away, many told their
homes may not be accessible until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipated we couldn't get back,'' said Stan Sneeden who
was one of hundreds turned back all day Thursday. ``They said no
homes were lost so that's good news.''
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina on Thursday, Gov. Jim Hodges lifted the
emergency evacuation order for coastal areas of the state and about
46,000 evacuees from 146,000 shelters began to head home. In all,
800,000 people in the state had been ordered from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Both the east- and westbound lanes of Interstate 26 were opened
to eastbound traffic as people streamed back to their houses, many
of whom could expect to find no power when they arrived. Public
utility officials said more than 200,000 customers across the state
were without power early Thursday, but repair work already was
under way.
</P>
<P>
   In Myrtle Beach, where the hurricane dumped 15 inches of rain in
two days, flooding was severe, and area rivers were rising from the
runoff farther inland. Rising waters were expected to crest this
weekend, a state emergency official said.

FORT WORTH, Texas: believe she's gone.''JOSEPH ENNIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``He was my only child,'' Donna Ennis said. ``He was a very
special child and he respected and loved me,'' she said, choking
back tears Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Ennis said that her 14-year-old son had been talking about
getting baptized recently, and that she wanted him to learn what it
was all about. So he started attending the youth group at First
Baptist Church in White Settlement, a Fort Worth suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, he attended the rally at Wedgwood Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to believe it, but I knew he had been shot in
the head,'' said Donna Ennis, who waited until 3 a.m. Thursday for
confirmation that her son was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, in the shade of the trees at the church Ennis had just
joined, Hootie Woldai stood with his arms crossed, trying not to
cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joey had his own way,'' Woldai said simply.
</P>
<P>
   All of Joey Ennis' friends and classmates, the ones he had grown
up with at West Elementary and in the close-knit environs of White
Settlement, the ones with their faces wet from tears, nodded their
heads at that description.
</P>
<P>
   Ennis, they said, was a basketball nut, a freckled boy with a
chili bowl haircut who hadn't started growing vertically but who
held out hope for his dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to be in the NBA,'' said Jennifer Cubillos, a
14-year-old classmate in the 9th grade at Brewer High School in
White Settlement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CASSANDRA GRIFFIN
</P>
<P>
   Cassandra Griffin was only 14 years old when Ashbrook entered
the church and took her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that stands out about Cassie is she was not your
typical teenager,'' said David Griffin, her father. ``She tried
very hard to please her mom and dad, and she had a very strong
faith in God.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Lockney, Texas, the North Crowley High School freshman
excelled at clarinet, which she had been playing since the sixth
grade. She also tinkered with the piano and the flute and liked to
sing.
</P>
<P>
   Her family moved to North Texas from West Texas two years ago,
and in that time, Cassie made many friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was always happy-go-lucky, easygoing,'' David Griffin
said. ``She had a real concern for her friends. She would pray for
her friends, and she was disappointed when they would go out
drinking.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Cassie brought home some of her friends after
school; they had dinner and then went to the rally. Her mother,
Tralissa Griffin, was at the rally, sitting about seven rows behind
her daughter when the gunman entered and started shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The thought still shocks the Griffin family.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to raise your children in the church, and you think of
all places, you'd be safe in church,'' David Griffin said.
</P>
<P>
   Cassie's brother, 11-year-old Chris, has been dealing with his
grief in his own way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been sleeping a lot, trying to forget,'' David Griffin
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Griffin family can never forget their only daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a beautiful girl.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SUSAN KIMBERLY JONES
</P>
<P>
   Susan Kimberly Jones sang in the Wedgwood church choir and had
enrolled at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Seminary student Vickie Stewart, who lives in Barnard dorm where
Jones lived, said many dorm residents were up late Wednesday night
crying and praying when they learned that Jones was among the dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a shock,'' said Stewart, 36. She said many students
were aware that Jones and about four other students had gone to the
church for the Wednesday night prayer service and began to worry as
they watched the news on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 23, lived on the third floor of the dorm. Outside her
room, 345, visitors are greeted by a Bible scripture that Jones
wrote on a small message board: ``Love must be sincere. Hate what
is evil. Cling to what is good. Be devoted to one another in
brotherly love. Romans 12:9-10.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JUSTIN RAY
</P>
<P>
   Justin ``Steggie'' Ray, 17, was a good kid who was starting to
turn his life around after floundering for two years because a
former stepfather left his life, his former Scoutmaster said.
</P>
<P>
   Known to many by the last name Stegner (from a former
stepfather), Ray was a Boy Scout who was also a Cub Scout camp
counselor. He seemed lost at Southwest High School until production
teacher Tim Hood piqued his interest in film and record producing,
said Malcolm Hill, Ray's former Scout leader.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, Ray transferred to Cassata High School, a
private alternative school. He hoped to graduate in December so he
could begin fulfilling his dream of owning his own production
company.
</P>
<P>
   At Cassata, Ray made friends like Chris Roddan and Travis
Laminack who were updating the school's promotional video as part
of Bobbie Su Nadal's video class.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really goal-oriented. That's what I liked about him,''
Nadal said. ``He took on the leadership role in the video class.''
</P>
<P>
   Nadal and Hill said Ray used his production skills to run
audiovisual equipment at concerts and PTA meetings, Cub Scout
ceremonies and other events.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a genius with that stuff,'' Laminack said. ``Media
technology was his thing. He came over here (Cassata) but he kept
going back to Southwest. I think Mr. Hood was like a father figure
to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray and Hood were running the band's sound equipment at Wedgwood
Baptist Church on Wednesday night when Ray was fatally shot,
Cassata counselor Brandon Pope said.
</P>
<P>
   Cassata teacher Dawn Farmer said Ray was a quiet thinker who
died doing what he loved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know he went to church there, but it doesn't surprise
me,'' Farmer said. ``He was quiet but he was deep. I think if
anyone was ready to meet his maker, he was.'' &QL;

<P>
   Ray and Hood were running the band's sound equipment at Wedgwood
Baptist Church on Wednesday night when Ray was fatally shot,
Cassata counselor Brandon Pope said.
</P>
<P>
   Cassata teacher Dawn Farmer said Ray was a quiet thinker who
died doing what he loved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know he went to church there, but it doesn't surprise
me,'' Farmer said. ``He was quiet but he was deep. I think if
anyone was ready to meet his maker, he was.'' &QL;

JUDGE TO GIVE FORGER STIFFER SENTENCE BECAUSE HE DAMAGED
REPUTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The man who sold millions of dollars worth of
documents with the forged signature of John F. Kennedy will likely
receive a stiffer-than-normal prison term because he designed a
fraud that was intended to damage the reputations of the late
president and other historical figures, a judge said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said that it is highly unusual for a judge to
consider the damage to historical reputations in sentencing a
defendant, although they acknowledged that the case of Lawrence X.
Cusack III was an extraordinary one.
</P>
<P>
   Cusack, a former paralegal, was found guilty last spring on all
13 counts of an indictment accusing him of creating the forged
documents, having them authenticated by experts and selling them to
investors for about $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most explosive of the hundreds of bogus documents sold
by Cusack were ones that linked John F. Kennedy to Marilyn Monroe
and a Chicago mob figure. The documents also purported to detail an
affair between Kennedy and Monroe and Kennedy's agreement to pay
hush money to the actress to remain silent about their
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Cusack faced a sentence of about six to eight years on his
convictions under federal sentencing guidelines, which trial judges
usually follow, but Thursday Judge Denise L. Cote of U.S. District
Court in Manhattan indicated that she would increase his sentence
by roughly two years when she sentenced him Friday, meaning Cusack
could receive a term of up to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said that another factor in her decision to increase
Cusack's sentence beyond what she might ordinarily have imposed was
evidence that he had looted the estate of his late father, a
prominent lawyer who had represented the archdiocese of New York
before his death in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The government has contended in court papers that during the
late 1980s, before Cusack embarked on his forged papers scheme, he
obtained a power of attorney from his widowed mother and used it to
take hundreds of thousands of dollars intended for her from his
father's estate and spent it on a fleet of luxury cars, 100 acres
of land in Maine, Rolex watches, and a full wardrobe of suits.
</P>
<P>
   More than $500,000 remains unaccounted for, a prosecutor, Peter
G. Neiman, told the judge Thursday, adding that Cusack's mother was
reduced to begging another of her sons for money to pay her rent.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In court Thursday, Cusack's lawyers attempted to undermine the
government's contentions about stealing from the estate, but Ms.
Cote seemed unmoved. One defense lawyer, Maranda E. Fritz, also
noted that a recent report submitted to the judge by a psychiatrist
hired by the defense said that Cusack had acknowledged and
expressed remorse for his conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The document has not been made public and there were no further
details of its contents, but it does not appear that Cusack made
any real admission that he had forged any documents. Ms. Cote, in
any case, again seemed unimpressed, responding that the evidence in
the trial had ``overwhelmingly'' refuted his position.
</P>
<P>
   Cusack, who was imprisoned in July, sat quietly in court
Thursday as his lawyers and the prosecutors argued about what
factors Ms. Cote should consider.
</P>
<P>
   One sentencing expert, Daniel J. Freed, a professor at Yale Law
School, said in a telephone interview that the tarnishing of
historical reputations could be a basis for a greater sentence if
the judge finds the crime is so unusual that it does not fit the
rigid rules that govern sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like this is not only an unusual crime, but one that
involves very public damage to a very important institution _ the
presidency,'' said Freed, who added that he was speaking generally
as he was not familiar with the specifics of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Cusack's lawyers, Ms. Fritz and Robert F. Katzberg, both
declined comment after the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Cusack might win some leniency Friday if he were to admit, for
the first time, that he had carried out the forgery scheme. In
presenting their case, prosecutors offered voluminous evidence
showing that Cusack's claim that the papers were genuine was
logically and historically impossible.
</P>
<P>
   On one document, for example, Kennedy had supposedly written the
words, ``secretary of education.'' But prosecutors pointed out that
the Department of Education was not created until 1979.
</P>
<P>
   A psychiatrist hired by the defense, Frank T. Miller, suggested
in a report that was filed publicly that it was unlikely that
Cusack would admit to the forgeries. Miller described Cusack as a
deeply troubled man who has largely given up on life and abandoned
himself to hopelessness. He said that Cusack had told him that he
does not fear prison, and that Cusack had said, ``My life has been
a prison. My past life has been a prison. I guess I didn't see the
difference it would make.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said that Cusack also was unable to appreciate the
consequences of his behavior, and was ``willing to suffer maximum
punishment even when the punishment can be reduced by appropriate
contrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, he could not admit his guilt in this case, even
though by doing so, he could have significantly reduced his
punishment,'' the psychiatrist wrote.

 &HT;    Floyd rips apart houses atop island
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAK ISLAND, N.C. _ At the mouth of the Cape Fear River,
Hurricane Floyd landed its biggest punch.
</P>
<P>
   Stilt houses once towering over the beach on this small resort
island of vacation rentals and Dairy Queens toppled to the surf.
Some simply vanished into pieces of timber. Beach Road disappeared
under sand, loose pilings, toilets, microwaves, washing machines
and all the other flotsam Floyd tossed aside as it crested on the
12.5-mile long island just west of where the river meets the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like every hurricane that comes up goes up the mouth
of the Cape Fear. It's like a magnet,'' said Von West, 52, who
huddled in his house a block from the beach as the storm shook his
roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look out on this beach, you see a lot of people's hopes
and dreams. Then you see this,'' he said, pointing to a house that
will almost certainly be submerged at high tide.
</P>
<P>
   Residents who stayed say winds howled the worst about 2:30 a.m.
But water, more than wind, ravaged this island of 8,000 residents
that swells to 45,000 during summer tourist months. Debris formed a
line in the sand like sea weed. Steps that once led from the beach
to houses were swept across the street. One house lurched sideways
as the floor hung from below. Every few minutes, it groaned eerily.
</P>
<P>
   Town Councilman Jeff Emsminger, who has lived on the island for
14 years, spent the day walking from one end to another with a
clipboard, adding up the damage. With three blocks to go, he
guessed that 20 houses had been completely washed away. The damage,
he said, will amount to millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got houses missing here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Emsminger also complained bitterly that the community, which
incorporated Yaupon Beach and Long Beach last year into one town,
has long fought for federal assistance to renourishes beaches and
protect the seaside houses with names like Sea Bee's Dream and Sea
King.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the federal government had cooperated with us the past few
years, you wouldn't see any of this,'' he said. ``I went through
Hugo and Hugo didn't do what this did.''
</P>
<P>
   The island has been inhabited since Colonial times, said
resident Randy Armstrong, 52. Fort Caswell sits on one end, with
its lighthouse that served during the American Revolution and
continued to guide ships until World War II. The island's first
industry was providing timber from the graceful oaks that grow
thickly on the island's interior to northern shipyards. Agriculture
eventually took over, then tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the houses lost were vacation rentals, which can cost as
little as $450 a week to rent to more than $3,000. Still, the
tourists here feel more like residents, with most returning
annually, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you noticed there's no motels? No condos?'' Armstrong, a
jeweler, asked. ``This is the kind of place you put your kid on a
bicycle and let him ride. This is a like a time warp.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the cozy feel stretches up and down the beach. Picket
fences surround some houses. The town's pride and joy was a
bathhouse and beach cabana where residents gathered in the
evenings, Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   But Floyd grabbed hold of the cabana and splintered it, leaving
only steps to a railing that now surrounds nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, residents who stayed back from the beach during
the storm _ about 100 remained despite a mandatory evacuation,
Emsminger said _ heard none of the devastation occurring just a
block away.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could only hear the wind and rain. We had the generator
going and I was watching movies but I'd step out every once in a
while,'' said Marvin Geddings, 28.
</P>
<P>
   Residents say with so many storms and hurricanes under their
belts in the last few years _ Bonnie, Bertha, Fran and Dennis _
they were feeling pretty confident about their new address in
``Hurricane Alley'' _ until Floyd began churning up the coast with
150 mph winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been through a lot of hurricanes and we've seen what
they can do,'' said Sally Skipper, 61, whose husband retired from
the Coast Guard in 1978 and just finished building their house
across from the beach two months ago. The couple fled inland, and
returned Thursday to find every shingle in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got christened well,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Others were not so lucky. At one house where Floyd had ripped
off siding and splintered stairs, someone had posted a sign in the
front: Yard Sale.

FORT WORTH OFFICIALS VOW TO OVERCOME THE HORROR
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Resending to correct name of victim to Joesph Ennis, sted
Dennis) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERNIE MAKOVY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ In mourning Larry Gene Ashbrook's bloody
carnage _ eight dead, seven wounded in a house of God _ Fort Worth
leaders vowed Thursday that the city will survive while police
worked to solve the puzzle of what drove the reclusive malcontent
to his deadly deed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grieve, but not as those who have no hope,'' said the Rev.
Al Meredith, whose Wedgwood Baptist Church became Ashbrook's
target. ``It's a dark day, it's a heartbreaking day, but in the
worst of our times, for those of us who know Christ, there is
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Kenneth Barr said the city will deal with the tragedy and
move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to let one senseless act of violence define
who we are as a city,'' Barr said. ``People responded. That's who
we are. We are not that gunman.''
</P>
<P>
   A cigarette dangling from his mouth and packing two weapons,
Ashbrook strolled into Wedgwood Baptist Church about 7 p.m.
Wednesday and unleashed terror on 150 to -200 people at a church
youth rally featuring the Christian band Forty Days.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all (expletive). I can't believe you believe this
junk, and (are) singing this,'' one witness quoted Ashbrook as
yelling. Witnesses also reported Ashbrook as saying, ``This
religion is (expletive),'' acting Police Chief Ralph Mendoza said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook then exploded a pipe bomb in a church aisle and
unloaded a barrage of random gunshots that hit 14 people, fatally
wounding seven. Of the survivors, two remain in serious condition.
One of them _ Justin Laird, a high school football kicker _ is
paralyzed from the neck down, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   After the shootings, Ashbrook sat in a back pew of the
sanctuary, placed a gun to his temple and killed himself.
</P>
<P>
   He had two weapons _ a Ruger 9mm pistol and an AMT .380. The
.380, Mendoza said, was traced to a now-closed establishment called
Guns 'n Such, where it was purchased Feb. 15, 1992. The second
weapon was probably purchased at the Traders Village flea market in
Grand Prairie, a Fort Worth suburb, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meredith said now is the time for the church and community to
remember their faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hearts' desire is that the King of Darkness will not
prevail,'' the pastor said. God ``weeps with those who weep, he
grieves with those who grieve and he knows what it's like to lose a
son.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr said that although such a tragedy can happen anywhere, ``I
assure you that yesterday, `anywhere' took on a whole new
meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one particular act by one particular individual who is
no longer living and will never hurt anyone again.''
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Ashbrook and his victims were removed from the
church by 3 a.m. Thursday after the area was painstakingly searched
of any bombs or other explosive devices Ashbrook might have left
behind. None was found.
</P>
<P>
   There is no indication that Ashbrook had an accomplice or that
he was involved with hate groups, Mendoza said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any specific information as to why he committed
this crime,'' Mendoza said.
</P>
<P>
   And that is what is so puzzling.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we would have to venture a guess that it was
random,'' Mendoza said. ``For me to understand him, I would have to
be abnormal, and I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   Police identified the slain victims Thursday as Shawn C. Brown
and Susan Kimberly Jones, both 23 and seminary students; Cassandra
Griffin, 14; Joseph D. Ennis, 14; Justin Ray, 17; and Kristi
Beckel, 14, all four students; and Sydney Browning, 36, the
church's choir director.
</P>
<P>
   The wounded were identified as Laird, the football player;
Robert Debord, 17; Mary Beth Talley, 17; and Nicholas Skinner, 14,
all students; Jeff Laster, 36; and Kevin Gailey, 38.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Parr, 14, a junior at Southwest High School in Fort Worth,
was initially misidentified as one of the victims. He was not at
the church during the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday, police searched Ashbrook's home for anything
that might indicate why he went on his rampage.
</P>
<P>
   They were more stunned by the condition of Ashbrook's home than
by the evidence they found inside.
</P>
<P>
   Toilets were plugged with concrete, motor oil filled shower
heads, walls were bashed in and Bibles and family portraits were
shredded, homicide Detective Curt Brannan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appeared as someone in that house was in a violent rage.
This person destroyed and shredded what many people would cherish _
family photos, possessions of deceased loved ones, the holy
Scriptures,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokesman Bob Garrity Jr. said the search revealed a freshly
cut pipe, a hacksaw, black powder, and empty boxes for 9mm and
.380-caliber ammunition. Writings included anti-religious
statements, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had trashed his house. Furniture was thrown about, tipped
over. There were big gaping holes in the walls, family photographs
down and broken and faces cut out of the photographs,'' Garrity
said.
</P>
<P>
   Garrity said evidence indicates that the concrete Ashbrook
poured down the toilet had been purchased just hours before the
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess, if nothing else, he was making a statement he was not
coming back,'' Garrity said. ``He knew when he left the house, he
was not coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrity said witness statements and the writings found inside
the home indicate that Ashbrook fit the profile of the typical mass
killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mass murderers typically are disenfranchised white males,''
Garrity said. ``They are asocial, loners. They have a very poor
employment history.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that these people do is, they have this
fantasy life. One of the motivators is they fantasize about this
life that they don't lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know if they go out with a high body count, they'll be
remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrity said some of the writings found in the home show that
Ashbrook had a difficult time holding a job and was paranoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is putting down, `I was fired from this job. They told me
for this reason, but I really know it's for that reason,' ''
Garrity said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors and friends described him as a loner who distinguished
himself by his bizarre behavior and penchant for psychedelic drugs
in the early 1970s. He was a troubled child who forced one young
neighbor girl to eat bugs, neighbors said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook was meticulous in maintaining his yard, even pruning
and tending pear trees in his back yard three hours before his
rampage at Wedgwood Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Berry, 14, said Ashbrook used to mow her family's yard
years ago. More recently, she and her mother often saw Ashbrook
sitting on his front porch watching others.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Ashbrook was on the porch about 3 p.m. as Berry
walked past his house to visit a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked kind of sad or distressed, maybe a little angry,''
Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said that five people unaccounted for late Wednesday
night were later identified as being victims within the church.
</P>
<P>
   Restoration companies are on standy to get the church ready for
services Sunday, said an official with the American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, beneath a sky dotted with gray rainclouds, the
neighborhood of Wedgwood awoke to a gruesome reality.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors and church members began walking by the church, still
blocked off by yellow police tape, and gazed at the scene, knowing
what had happened but not wanting to believe.
</P>
<P>
   About 10:20 am, a blond-haired man made his way through the
throng of camera tripods and milling reporters to a church sign on
the corner of Wales and Walton streets. He gently placed a bouquet
of lilies at the base of the sign and walked away quietly.
</P>
<P>
   The envelope read, ``We Love You!''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, North Texas residents placed silk flowers,
carnations, daisies and a variety of other flowers at the corner
church site.
</P>
<P>
   Cards with ``To Our Angels'' and ``We Love You'' were pinned to
the flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Spahr lives in Colorado Springs, near Littleton. Less than
five months ago, his community was rocked by a vicious shooting at
Columbine High School that ended in 15 dead, including the two
teen-age gunman.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart goes out and my love goes out to the families,'' said
Spahr, who was in Fort Worth on business. ``Become one, become a
unit, pull together and love your family,'' he said. &QL;

   GAME OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   Oakland (0-1) vs. Minnesota (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: Raiders (409) _ yardage allowed Green Bay. Vikings (8
of 9) _ home openers won.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders led Green Bay late and then stood by helplessly as
the Packers kept driving for big yards and big points for a
last-second victory. Now Oakland hits the road again in its second
of three straight against the National Football Conference Central
division. What it will find in Minnesota is a team eager to
duplicate last season's offensive exploits, a team yearning to blow
its offense open en route. Oakland allowed 409 yards and 28 points
at Green Bay. Look for improvement, but not enough, in a testy
battle featuring big plays.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Vikings, 26-20.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY, 1 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville (1-0) vs. Carolina (0-1)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: Jaguars (10.8) _ Reggie Barlow's punt return average.
Panthers (9-7) _ record vs. the AFC.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: These two recent expansion teams are heading in
opposite directions. The Jaguars are climbing; the Panthers are
sinking. Dom Capers used to coach the Panthers. He is now the
Jaguars' defense coordinator. Last week his group held San
Francisco to three points; Carolina doubles that but still sinks.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Jaguars 23-6.
</P>
<P>
   Washington (0-1) vs. Giants (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: Redskins (3-6-1) _ Turner's record vs. Giants. Giants
(plus 5) _ turnover differential.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Mike Nolan, the Redskins' defensive coordinator, used
to hold that job with the Giants but now works under Norv Turner,
Washington's embattled head coach. When Nolan left three years ago,
many Giants thought they had lost one of the best defensive minds
around. But John Fox replaced him and has made Nolan a distant
memory. Fox leads a group that scored more points (14) last week
than many offenses did, including the Giants'. Washington's offense
streaked toward 504 yards and 35 points against Dallas last week,
and the Redskins still lost. It is a magical matchup _ the
Washington offense against the Giants' defense. Take the Giants'
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Giants, 21-17.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay (1-0) vs. Detroit (1-0)
</P>

   Key Stats: Packers (4.3) _ Levens' average yards per run. Lions
(6.0) _ Rivers' average yards per run.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: So Ron Rivers is outrunning Dorsey Levens? Rivers, the
retired Barry Sanders' replacement, rushed 16 times for 96 yards in
Detroit's rousing 28-20 victory at Seattle. Charlie Batch threw
three touchdown passes, Robert Porcher made three sacks and the
Lions' defense held Mike Holmgren's ballyhooed offensive system and
players to 205 yards. Of course, doing that to Brett Favre and the
Packers will be more challenging. Look for Favre, again, to win it
late.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Packers, 24-20.

   Indianapolis (1-0) vs. New England (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: Colts _ (1) '98 division victories. Patriots (14-4) _
in last 18 at home.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Indianapolis won one American Football Conference East
division game last year. Having beaten Buffalo last week, it can
double that number for this season. It will attempt to do so
against a team that usually shakes the Colts silly. Patriots
quarterback Drew Bledsoe owns a career-most nine victories against
the Colts. In his last five games against them, he has thrown 11
touchdown passes and one interception and earned a 108.4
quarterback rating. The Patriots hope they have found a solid
running threat in the veteran Terry Allen. Their defensive stars
(Ty Law, Willie McGinnest, Lawyer Milloy, Chris Slade) made huge
plays at big times against the Jets. New England played confidently
against the Jets and will illustrate even more confidence here.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Patriots, 21-14.

   Pittsburgh (1-0) vs. Baltimore (0-1)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: Steelers (40) _ yards allowed vs. Browns. Ravens
(44.6) _ Mitchell quarterback rating.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Scott Mitchell, the Ravens' quarterback, needs a strong
showing. He got a second chance as a starter this year after things
blew up for him in Detroit last year. His start last week against
St. Louis _ 17-of-40 for 188 yards with a touchdown and two
interceptions in a 27-10 loss _ was lackluster. Nothing like what
Kordell Stewart did, attacking the Cleveland Browns on the ground
and in the air with a display of quickness and arm strength and
precision that made Steelers fans hopeful. Are they back? Why, yes,
for the moment, they are.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Steelers, 19-17.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay (0-1) vs. Philadelphia (0-1)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: Buccaneers (minus 5) _ turnover differential. Eagles
(103) _ Staley rushing yards.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Duce Staley is a diminutive running back who is fun to
watch. He hits holes quickly and keeps chucking _ this Eagles back
has gained 100 or more yards from scrimmage in each of his last
seven games. He is one of the few bright spots for the Eagles,
losers again last week in painful fashion, 25-24, against Arizona.
Now come the Buccaneers and their stressed-out quarterback, Trent
Dilfer, who absolutely needs a big game, a victory. He is on the
verge of getting benched for good after just two '99 starts. His
last one was lousy (two interceptions returned for touchdowns)
against the Giants. This one is better.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Buccaneers, 16-13.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego (0-0) vs. Cincinnati (0-1)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: (0) _ 100-yard rushers allowed. Bengals (90) _ QB
Blake's rushing yards.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: That's right, the Chargers did not allow a 100-yard
rusher in 1998. They didn't play last week, the only NFL team to
have be a bye on opening weekend. How strange for the Chargers to
be the only team at home watching the season unfold and pass them
by? There is time to catch up, right now. As a matter of fact, each
team in their division (AFC West) lost last week, so the Chargers
are in first place at 0-0. If only the Bengals could gain a bye
every week. They lost another game in sorry fashion, 36-35, at
Tennessee, wilting when it counted most. Both teams follow their
current suits.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Chargers, 27-21.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona (1-0) vs. Miami (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: Cardinals (4) _ winning streak. Dolphins (25-9) _
September record in '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Arizona had not won four consecutive regular-season
games since 1988. It is winning with quarterback Jake Plummer, who
owns 10 comeback victories in his 27 Cardinals games. What a
thrilling victory for the Cardinals at Philadelphia, but now they
are matched against a team riding high after dumping Denver on
Monday night. This is no time to let down, and the Dolphins won't.
Dan Marino has never lost to the Cardinals in three games and has
never thrown an interception against them compared with his seven
touchdowns. Miami has never lost to the Cardinals, going 7-0 all
time. Make it 8-0.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Dolphins, 30-20.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle (0-1) vs. Chicago (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: Seahawks (7,894) _ Watters' career rush yards. Bears
(16) _ passing first downs.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Chicago beat Kansas City and Seattle lost to Detroit
last week. Most expected those results to be opposite. Not the
Bears. Under Dick Jauron, their new coach, the Bears are refreshed
and optimistic. Playing at home for a second straight week is a
plus. But Seattle Coach Mike Holmgren has won 10 straight over the
Bears and is 6-1 in Soldier Field. He knows them. His quarterback,
Jon Kitna, earned a 107.9 quarterback rating last week against
Detroit. He did not earn enough big plays to win, but his
performance was solid. Another good showing from Kitna and more
running from Ricky Watters will make the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Seahawks, 16-9.

<P>
   Key Stats: Browns (2) _ first downs vs. Pittsburgh. Titans (162)
_ Dyson's record yards.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: After a pitiful offensive showing against Pittsburgh,
Cleveland has chosen to move the heralded rookie Tim Couch into the
starting quarterback slot. Is Couch ready? Well, Ty Detmer
certainly wasn't. He struggled mightily as the starter against
Pittsburgh (6-of-12 for 52 yards, an interception and a quarterback
rating of 25.2). Tennessee struggled early against Cincinnati
before compiling 403 yards of offense, 162 of it by receiver Kevin
Dyson. Tennessee has won seven consecutive division games. Al Del
Greco has converted a club-record 19 consecutive field goals.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Titans, 31-17.

   Denver (0-1) vs. Kansas City (0-1)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: (61) _ Davis' rushing yards. Chiefs (8.96) _ average
gain on first down.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: After Denver's debacle against Miami on Monday night,
the Dolphins felt sure that Terrell Davis was still hurting from a
shoulder injury. He rushed for only 61 yards and left for much of
the fourth quarter. His team exited for much of the game. The
Broncos hope to rebound in Arrowhead Stadium, where they won, 30-7,
last year in what was the signature game for the Chiefs' deplorable
season. It was the game in which the Chiefs unraveled, showing
their frustration with a bushel of ugly personal foul penalties.
Denver seeks improvement. Kansas City seeks retribution. Take the
angry team.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Chiefs, 24-21.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans (1-0) vs. San Francisco (0-1)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: Saints (12) _ sacks in last two games. 49ers (17) _
home winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Big game for the Saints, a confidence builder against
the team that has dominated this division in the .90s. Big game for
the 49ers after last week's blowout loss (41-3) at Jacksonville.
Hands are wringing in San Francisco. Is this it? Are the good times
gone? Can quarterback Steve Young do it anymore? Young needs help,
especially from the running game. Charlie Garner and Lawrence
Phillips need to produce more at running back. If the 49ers get it,
they win easily. They do.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: 49ers, 36-17.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY 8 P.M. GAME
</P>
<P>
   Jets (0-1) vs. Buffalo (0-1)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: Jets (194) _ Johnson record yards. Bills (20) _
Flutie incompletions.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Both teams seek to avert not only an 0-2 start but also
an 0-2 division start. The Jets turn to Rick Mirer at quarterback
and hope that Keyshawn Johnson (eight catches, career-high 194
receiving yards against New England) can maintain his fast pace. It
is the Jets' first chance to show what they can do without the
injured Vinny Testaverde. Flutie was all over the place in his
team's loss at Indianapolis. Flutie completed only 22-of-42 passes
in the scrambling mode that is his game. The Jets will try to box
him, keep him contained and let the game boil down to Curtis Martin
vs. Antowain Smith at running back. Martin can win that battle.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Jets, 17-14.
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY NIGHT GAME
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta (0-1) vs. Dallas (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: Falcons (minus 3) _ turnover differential. Cowboys
(541) _ offensive yards.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Atlanta lost to Minnesota because the Falcons kept
dropping the ball. Dallas beat Washington in overtime because the
Cowboys kept getting the ball into the end zone. If those trends
continue, it will be a troublesome start for Atlanta. If Chris
Chandler (hamstring) plays, he has a chance to improve on his 20-9
record as the Falcons' starter. Expect Chandler to make it _ he has
not played in a Monday night game in 11 years. Dallas will win with
special-teams play and with the arm of Troy Aikman and hands and
fleet feet of Rocket Ismail in another pitch-and-catch deep-passing
display.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Cowboys, 23-21.

 &HT;    Floyd's rain pummels N.C.
 &HT;    By Mary McLachlin, Jenny Staletovich and Sonja Isger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ Hurricane Floyd, one of the most feared
storms of the 20th century, continued to create havoc throughout
the Carolinas, Virginia and the Northeast even at half its full
strength Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Floyd's center wheeled past the casinos of Atlantic
City, N.J., Thursday afternoon, it had whipped and wrung itself
down to a tropical storm _ but not before dropping up to 19 inches
of rain in the Carolinas, causing hundreds of airline flights to be
canceled, interrupting train and ferry service all along the East
Coast and throwing New York and New Jersey into states of
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   A tropical storm warning for heavy rains and winds of more than
40 mph was in effect in northern New Jersey and New York City and
up to the Merrimack River in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd had been feared most for the intensity of its winds, which
had reached 155 mph over the South Atlantic and made it a
borderline Category 5 hurricane, the most destructive of all. But
after raking the Bahamas with winds of more than 100 mph, Floyd
collided with a cold front pushing a trough of low pressure and the
combination turned it into a super-wet storm when it hit the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It interacted with the cold front, and together they made more
(rain) than either one by itself,'' said Jim Lushine, storm warning
coordinator for the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane brought the largest peacetime evacuation in U.S.
history from Florida's east coast northward. It plowed into the
North Carolina coast just before dawn Thursday, triggering
widespread flooding and blacking out power to hundreds of thousands
of people.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina Gov. James Hunt said thousands of residents had
lost their homes and damage would be in the hundreds of millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   At least seven deaths were blamed on Floyd, including four in
North Carolina from traffic accidents provoked by the storm. In
Maryland, one man died Wednesday of a heart attack while overseeing
a Red Cross shelter set up in his school building.
</P>
<P>
   Another man was swept away Tuesday by a raging storm tide in the
Bahamas, which bore the brunt of the hurricane's force before it
turned north into cooler waters and began to weaken. Floyd's storm
surge and wind gusts up to 190 mph swept an entire village out to
sea, flattened hundreds of homes and destroyed power and phone
lines throughout the islands.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, 65,000 Florida Power &AMP; Light customers were still
without electricity Thursday night, mostly in Volusia and Brevard
counties. FPL expects to have all power restored by tonight,
spokeswoman Betty Nunez said.
</P>
<P>
   As the storm swept farther up the U.S. coast, winds and rain
caused 1.4 million utility customers from South Carolina to New
Jersey to lose power. Flooding and power failures combined to shut
down Portsmouth, Va.'s water supply system, which serves 110,000
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Schools were closed for more than 2 million youngsters in
Washington, Baltimore, all of New Jersey, Philadelphia and New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach International Airport was open Thursday, but many
travelers were stranded. All flights to the Northeast were canceled
or delayed as Floyd affected airports from South Carolina to New
England. Flights to and from Boston, Hartford, New York and Newark
were canceled. Flights to Philadelphia, Raleigh/Durham, Baltimore
and Washington were expected to resume Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd roared ashore at 3 a.m. near Cape Fear, N.C., with 110 mph
winds, then quickly weakened after flooding the coasts of the
Carolinas and Virginia with more than a foot of rain and chasing
tens of thousands of people into shelters. It was downgraded to a
tropical storm as sustained winds fell to 65 mph, below the 74 mph
threshold for a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Until Hurricane Floyd, thousands of people who live on the
twisting roads near the border of North and South Carolina thought
they were on high ground. But Floyd wasn't like other hurricanes _
it didn't smash windows, rip off roofs or snap acres of trees.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it quietly filled nearby swamps and rivers, leaving
damage that continued to creep into homes well after the skies had
cleared.
</P>
<P>
   Areas of the North Carolina coast and the Myrtle Beach area of
South Carolina got up to 16 inches of rain, and a foot fell on
Virginia's Tidewater region. Wilmington got 13 inches. Water and
sand swept over Wrightsville Beach and other beach communities,
burying the ocean roads. Most remained closed for much of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmington's barrier islands and old city streets were largely
undamaged, but severe flooding closed part of Interstate 40. With
white caps forming in places, some people drove across the highway
median while the less lucky abandoned their cars.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wilmington looked as if it sustained only a hard rain,
not a hurricane. While power was lost to most of the city for much
of the day, few lines were downed.
</P>
<P>
   Inland was a different story. Small towns to the north in Pender
County struggled with rising water from creeks washing over roads,
into yards and through front doors. At first light, the Castle
Hayne Volunteer Fire Department pulled one motorist from his car as
it stalled under a current of water.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to the Northeast Cape Fear River, water flooded the
entire hamlet of Burgaw Creek. Everywhere in the community of about
75 houses, neighbors stood on porches, some venturing out in
rowboats. Bill and Betty Lundsford stayed dry on their porch while
their son, his wife and two children waded up the driveway in 3
feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried three ways to get here,'' said Patrick Lundsford, 33.
</P>
<P>
   The Lundsfords moved to their house along Highway 53 after
Hurricane Fran destroyed their other house. They built the new
house about 4 feet off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put it as high as we could, but I guess it wasn't high
enough,'' Betty Lundsford said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say worse flooding in the area is yet to come as
rivers continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton declared a major disaster in North Carolina,
and released $528 million to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency to help hurricane victims.
</P>
<P>
   The wind set a Ferris wheel spinning on its own at Ocean City,
Md., and overturned an empty truck on the high Chesapeake Bay
Bridge. Virginia closed the 18-mile-long Chesapeake Bay
Bridge-Tunnel, and New York City shut down the exposed upper deck
of the Verrazano Narrows Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities had urged more than 2.6 million people along the
southern Atlantic coast to clear out of Floyd's path, and more
people were urged to evacuate in parts of Virginia, Maryland, New
Jersey and Long Island, where the storm hit late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   New York City sent nonessential municipal employees home early
and urged businesses to do the same because of the possibility of
widespread mass transit outages during the rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   For most of Florida, Floyd's damage was light and there were no
reports of deaths or serious injuries. Some North Floridians
returning from the state's massive evacuation were dismayed about
the sand and debris inside their homes and the cleanup ahead, but
most were relieved the damage wasn't worse.
</P>
<P>
   In Fernandina Beach, Terry Laughinghouse had boarded up her
two-story stilt house that backs up to the ocean and fled with
thousands of others as the storm approached. What should have been
a one-hour drive to Waycross, Ga., turned into a seven-hour
odyssey, as highways became impossibly clogged with evacuees
seeking shelter.
</P>
<P>
   When Laughinghouse came home Thursday, she found the force of
Floyd's storm surge had collapsed the back wall of the first-floor
garage, pushing tons of sand through and knocking out the doors.
Sand was 4 feet deep in the garage, but the main part of the house
had no major damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``God and plywood were on my side,'' she said.

FORBES BACK IN STATE, HOPES FOR '96 RERUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON - Presidential hopeful Steve Forbes, hoping against long
odds for a repeat performance, returned Sept. 16 to the state that
four years ago crowned him as a serious contender for the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who stunned political observers by winning Arizona's
primary in 1996, began a two-day campaign swing through the state
by re-issuing a challenge to the campaign's front-runner, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, for a series of debates. Bush has been
avoiding appearances with other GOP candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes also warned that the looming defection of Pat Bu chanan
to a third party should stand out as a ``dramatic wake-up call'' to
the GOP to not stray from its conservative roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last couple of election cycles we have had mush,'' Forbes
said. ``You have either got that inspired message or eventually you
go the way of the Whigs.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Forbes won Arizona's Feb. 22 primary with 33 percent of
the vote, beating the eventual nominee Bob Dole, who placed second
with 30 percent. Buchanan placed third with 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Forbes has often pointed to his victory as proof
that he can get elected. At last month's Iowa Straw Poll, his
first-place finish in Arizona was featured prominently in a
campaign video that played inside the Iowa State University
Coliseum, paid for by Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who finished second to Bush in the straw poll, has been
prodding the front-runner to debate him, a match-up that continued
to elude Forbes after Bush on Sept. 15 decided to forgo a debate
that was scheduled to be televised nationally from Florida early
next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have issued a challenge for a series of debates - I don't
care where he wishes to hold them - between now and year-end so
people can hear for themselves what each candidate stands for,''
Forbes said before a fund-raiser at the Savoy Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to get a gauge - to get a feel - for whether a
candidate is serious about making real change in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes also came close to accusing Bush of hypocrisy for posting
the names of each of his campaign contributors on his Internet Web
site while remaining mum on a number of issues facing the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very telling that he's willing to reveal the
source of his money, but he's not willing to reveal what his
positions are,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate has made it clear he will vigorously contend for
the GOP's favor again in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Forbes set up a sizable campaign office here
to nurture a fund-raising and organizational effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my favorite state, for obvious reasons,'' Forbes said
on Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 17 Forbes will appear before the Arizona Chamber of
Commerce with New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, who has endorsed his
candidacy, and later will attend a town hall meeting at a
retirement community in Mesa, followed by a fund-raising dinner at
the Arizona Historical Society.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his focus on the state, observers say Forbes has miles
to go before he can catch up to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The latest poll conducted by the Rocky Mountain Behavior
Research Associates, an Arizona group, placed Forbes fourth, with 9
percent of the vote. Bush garnered 37 percent, Arizona Sen. John
McCain got 21 percent and Elizabeth Dole 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Pollster Earl de Berge said Forbes is facing a much different
set of competitors and issues in this race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that the conditions are the same (as in 1996),
nor are the candidates the same. It's comparing apples and
oranges,'' de Berge said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes steamed to victory in 1996 largely on the engine of his
flat-tax proposal. And while the candidate has broadened the scope
of his appeal, taking detailed stands on issues such as abortion
and education, he is still heavily identified with tax reduction, a
``cause celebre'' from another time, according to de Berge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think (voters) are fixated on taxes the way they
were in 96. Wrong issue, wrong time,'' de Berge said.
</P>
<P>
   During a radio call-in show in which he was asked, among other
things, whether he had ever ingested cocaine - a question that Bush
has largely declined to answer - Forbes said no.
</P>
<P>
   '`I drink Coca Cola, but I've never sniffed cocaine,'' he said,
adding that he thought such issues were peripheral to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in response to a question about the Endangered Species
Act, Forbes attempted to flash his conservative credentials by
relating a story about a protected species of fly in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``There they wanted to close the highway for two months out of
the year so the flies could cross the road and not face windshield
hazard,'' he said without specifying which species of fly he was
speaking about. ``This is how bizarre it (the Act) has gotten.''
</P>
<P>
   About 500 Tucsonans paid $10 each to eat barbecue and hobnob
with Forbes. He stuck around long enough to hand out free signed
copies of his books to 350 of them.
</P>
<P>
   Several supporters said the candidate's message has retained its
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted for him for the nomination four years ago, and I hope
he makes it as president this time,'' said Thomas Evans, a retired
financing agent living in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said he does not buy into predictions that Bush has the
nomination sewed up, invoking the name of another unlikely
candidate.
</P>
<P>

 AMERICA-COLUMN-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID LEIBOWITZ 
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
PHOENIX - The controversy stalking Atlantic City may feel new,
thoroughly modern, but really the story is 50 years old. The debate
over Miss America's virtue, over her marital status and her womb,
begins not in New Jersey, but in a tiny chapel in Litchfield Park.
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a tiny brunette, a Miss Ari zona named Jacque Mercer, and a
plain gold wedding band.
</P>
<P>
   Jacque's North High School sweetheart, Doug Cook, slipped this
band onto her finger on Dec. 27, 1949. The groom was 21, an art stu
dent; the bride 18, a Phoenix Col lege freshman and a school
principal's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Their union set off more than wedding bells. Of course, the
bride's was not just any ring finger.
</P>
<P>
   On the day she got married, Jac que Mercer was the reigning Miss
America 1949 _ three months into her year wearing the
diamond-dusted crown.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this, the Mercer nup tials owned the front page of
that day's Republic _ ``Jacque, Doug Cook Are Wed'' ran the
headline in a point size usually reserved for wars. This drew
national press, which in turn sent the Miss America officials into
apoplexy.
</P>
<P>
   Pageant chairman Park W. Haver stick gave Jacque a statement for
a wedding gift: ``There is no prece dent in this,'' he said. ``It
is the first time a Miss America has married before completing the
obligations that go with the title.''
</P>
<P>
   It would also be the last: Though the pageant backed down days
later, letting Jacque keep her title, Haver stick and peers passed
a ``no wed ding, no pregnancy rule'' the very next year. It was the
repeal of that rule, 49 years later, that caused the hubbub in
Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   After Haverstick's decision, the controversy faded, as did the
beauty queen who started it. Jacque Mercer died in California 17
years ago. Her obituary cites leukemia, but some who knew her well
call the disease more side effect than cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be around her, you'd think that she was at the height of
happi ness, but underneath that you won dered,'' says her
stepmother, Margaret Mercer, now 88 years old and living in a
nursing home on 16th Street. ``I'm very opposed to these beauty
contests and people be ing elevated to something of fame. They just
don't come down off of it. I think that was a great deal of her
trouble.'' &QL; 
High price of early fame &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jacque Mercer wore trouble like a contestant's silk sash.
</P>
<P>
   Her wedding to Cook was the first of four. The union lasted into
1952. Jacque's second marriage, to a ``casual acquaintance,'' ended
after 11 days. A year later came her long relationship _ with
Richard Cur ran, a star running back at Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   The two had a son and a daugh ter. Richard played for the Green
Bay Packers, then retired to found an advertising agency in town.
Jac que worked with him for years. Their divorce happened in 1974.
Then Richard got into the land busi ness with swindler par
excellence Ned Warren. Curran's conviction on 33 counts of land
fraud happened in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Around that same time came trouble for their son, Richard Jr.,
nicknamed ``Dandy.'' Old newspa per clips detail a drug bust in New
Mexico, a plea deal and a felony conviction. Other clips mention
the son's disappearance and permanent estrangement from his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't talk about that,'' Mar garet Mercer says.
</P>
<P>
   Jacque, meanwhile, stayed single for a few years. She went into
real estate, coaxed her daughter, Shan non, to the title of Miss
Teenage Ar izona, and got reacquainted with another North High
grad, Dr. Mar vin Gillespie. They married in Cali fornia in January
1978.
</P>
<P>
   If they were happy for long, it dissolved in a liquor river.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to rehabilitate her in her alcoholism,'' Margaret
Mercer explains, ``but she'd come out and go right back at it
again. It just wasn't successful. Eventually, she was diagnosed as
having leukemia.'' &QL; 
The world's not a stage &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Jacque Mercer, life never got better than those few months
50 years ago, days when she alternated between wearing a tiara and
a crown. The old stories say she won Miss America on the strength
of a dramatic reading _ the suicide scene from Romeo and Juliet.
</P>
<P>
   First, she performed Shakespeare, then she lived it.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Cook, Jacque's first hus band, went on to a career as a col
lege professor. He's still a Phoenix resident and he remained
friends with Jacque until her death. He can still recall giving her
the ring that sparked the rule that sparked a con troversy half a
century later.
</P>
<P>
   ``She never quite recaptured the excitement of the Miss America
achievement. She hit a bright point in her life and then . . .
there's not a heckuva lot else for a former Miss America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jacque never found that some thing else.'' &QL;

A PUBLIC FIXATED ON THE WEATHER IS MESMERIZED BY FLOYD
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Okla, N.D., Utah, Mass.)  (See also HURRICANE-RDP, HURRICANE-NY, HURRICANE-NY-SCENE)

 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For days, Bob Chartuk, a spokesman for the National Weather
Service, had been answering an endless stream of phone calls from
reporters as Hurricane Floyd rumbled up the East Coast. Perhaps the
most unexpected call, he said, came from a radio station in North
Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   The hosts of a midday talk show on KVMI, 96.7 FM, put him live
on the air in West Fargo, introducing his segment with a pounding
heavy-metal tune by Megadeth. ``The music was certainly
appropriate,'' said Chartuk, who works at an office in Bohemia on
Long Island but answers queries to the National Hurricane Center in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dangerous and hard driving, just like Floyd. But I couldn't
quite figure out why they were interested in our hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dakotans, like everyone else, seemed hypnotized by the
swirling, evil-eyed monster. From the West Coast to London, and
certainly from New Jersey through the five boroughs of New York
City and around New England, Floyd fixated millions of people
Thursday, staring at some from television screens with its
Cyclopian eye etched in synthetic orange swirls and blasting others
right in the face with potent, rainy gusts.
</P>
<P>
   The storm hit dead center on the nerve that seems to jangle in
more and more people these days any time the weather grows
dangerous or unusual. Part of the jangling might be that the
weather has seemed more intense lately: there was the scorching
drought that is a soggy memory now; there was the tornado that
shocked Salt Lake City, and of course the giant F5-strength tornado
that trampled Oklahoma City in May.
</P>
<P>
   But weather experts say that other factors have contributed to
the growing fascination. Some are obvious, such as the growth of
on-demand weather broadcasts, with the Weather Channel and even CNN
following storms nonstop. The Weather Channel broke its record for
viewers on Tuesday, with 2.5 million households tuning in.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the Internet, with the Web site for the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, www.noaa.gov, receiving
about three million visits a day earlier this week, according to
Chartuk. Dozens of other weather-related sites have sprung up in
the last few years. The Weather Channel's site, weather.com, hit a
record on Tuesday, a spokesman for the channel said, with more than
23 million visits as the storm passed Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But less obvious changes may also account for the increased
attention, said John W. Firor, a senior climatologist at the
National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Far more people live in harm's way than ever before, he said.
Thickets of expensive beach-front houses sit where only marsh grass
grew a few decades ago, raising the stakes when a giant storm
sweeps a coast, and contributing to the record exodus of people
that paralyzed highways from Florida to the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   The news used to begin when a hurricane struck and end with the
cleanup. Now, he said, we watch for days ahead of time _ often from
the moment a wispy cluster of thunderstorms off the African coast
coalesces into a depression and then a tropical storm, and finally
a hurricane. Then it wanders and weaves, almost like some brooding
animal, until it picks a course and charges the coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a drama to it,'' Firor said.
</P>
<P>
   Other weather experts said that maybe it is not so much that new
technologies are changing the way we think, but instead allowing us
to return to our roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be just one of those things that takes us back to our
elemental days when we were a lot more attuned to the weather than
we are now,'' said Doyle S. Rice, the managing editor of
Weatherwise, a 51-year-old journal about, yes, the weather.
``Weather is something that touches you at a level deeper than a
lot of other things,'' Rice said. ``I'm cold, I'm hot, I'm wet.
These are things that really get right back down to your gut.''
</P>
<P>
   And unlike a sports event or movie, a big storm, although
entertaining, is uncluttered. ``It isn't `Hurricane Floyd,' brought
to you by the Weather Channel,''' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, hurricanes have brought celebrity status to a few,
including John Hope, the Weather Channel's mustachioed maestro, who
at the age of 80 has been trying to retire from his position for a
while, but keeps coming back every time a big storm brews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't seem to help myself,'' Hope said. He has become known
in some circles as the Walter Cronkite of weather. ``I haven't had
time to check my fan mail today,'' Hope said Thursday night, as he
arrived to announce Floyd's end game.
</P>
<P>
   His fans mainly are avid viewers that Weather Channel managers
refer to as people who are ``weather engaged.'' But some thank-you
notes come from people who were convinced to evacuate a shoreline
because of Hope's warnings.
</P>
<P>
   The ``weather engaged'' range from retirees to school children,
and, in fact, meteorology clubs have been popping up at many
schools. But no one need worry that meteorology is going through a
boom, said Dr. Keith L. Seitter, the deputy executive director of
the American Meteorological Society.
</P>
<P>
   He said that about 500 people receive bachelor's degrees in the
subject each year, about 200 get master's degrees, and 100 receive
a doctorate in meteorology, with the total growing about 3 percent
a year.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, as the weakening storm swept toward New York City
and up into New England, at least a few people there welcomed its
arrival.
</P>
<P>
   In Gloucester, Mass., a film crew was making the adaptation of
``The Perfect Storm,'' the 1997 best seller about a deadly
Northeaster. Sebastian Junger, the author of the book, was there as
a spectator, watching as the crew sent the Hannah Boden, one of the
fishing boats in the story, out to sea to get some real-life storm
shots.
</P>
<P>
   Junger, who lives in Manhattan, said that most people secretly
desire the wild sense of danger in a big storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tremendous experience,'' he said. ``We live in such a
safe society and people are a little bit thrilled by a situation
where you're not in control. Where all you can do is hunker down
and wait it out. A blizzard in New York is the same thing. As much
as they sort of swear at the inconvenience and mutter, it's also
satisfying to people that that can happen.''

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Making a commitment that the head of the United Negro
College Fund described as ``earth-shattering, landscape-changing,''
Bill Gates and his wife, Melinda, on Thursday formally announced a
$1 billion scholarship program for minority students that will
guarantee recipients full financing for college and advanced
degrees. It is one of the largest philanthropic gifts ever made.
</P>
<P>
   United Negro College Fund president William Gray predicted that
the scholarships, for at least 1,000 students a year over the next
20 years, would ultimately lead to noticeable growth in the numbers
of black, Hispanic and American Indian students who receive
doctorates.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, whose organization will administer the Gates Millennium
Scholarship program with help from the San Francisco-based Hispanic
Scholarship Fund and the Denver-based American Indian College Fund,
said he believed that the scholarships would lead to increases of
15 percent to 40 percent in the numbers of minority students who
receive doctorates in mathematics, the sciences, engineering and
education, the fields covered by the scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he was hailed by minority educators and said in an
interview that he was making ``nothing in the way of a political
statement,'' Gates, co-founder and chairman of Microsoft Corp.,
came under some criticism Thursday from opponents of affirmative
action programs. They did not question his legal right to donate
the money, but faulted him for not opening the program to white
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program will unquestionably do a lot of good, but it
raises a real concern,'' said John Carlson, the host of a local
talk-radio program and leader of a successful campaign last year
for passage of a ballot initiative that effectively ended
state-supported affirmative action programs in Washington state by
banning consideration of race in hiring, contracting and university
admissions. ``Shouldn't this apply to all kids from underprivileged
backgrounds, regardless of their skin color?''
</P>
<P>
   Gates defended the program's focus on minority students, saying
he considered it an obvious national problem that some minority
groups were woefully underrepresented in the high-tech industry and
on so many university campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that private philanthropy can be part of making sure
there is equal opportunity, I think you'd get virtually every
politician to feel like that's a very positive thing,'' Gates said
in an interview at the headquarters of the Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation, which with $17 billion in assets is the largest
philanthropic organization in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can deny that there is a huge gap, particularly in
these key areas, for minority students,'' said Gates, who dropped
out of Harvard University to found Microsoft, ``and the financial
barriers are a substantial element in that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gates and his wife have so far set global health issues and
education as their two top priorities for philanthropic giving,
though Thursday's commitment far surpasses any other gift they have
made. The foundation they have established is headed by Gates'
father, William H. Gates Jr., and by Patty Stonesifer, a former
Microsoft executive and longtime friend of the younger Gates.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft chairman, whose vast holdings of Microsoft stock
make him the wealthiest person in the world, with a net worth of
about $90 billion, said that he was devoting 5 to 10 hours a week
to philanthropic matters and that he did not expect that to change
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I have a job,'' he explained Thursday. ``It doesn't
have any expiration date on it and certainly there's more than
enough challenges in that job.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes amid a national debate over affirmative
action, including the passage of measures banning it in California
and Washington and campaigns for similar laws in Michigan and
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In the freshman class here at the University of Washington,
officials are projecting that they will have about 40 percent fewer
black students, 30 percent fewer Hispanic students and 20 percent
fewer American Indians than were registered last fall, before the
initiative was approved by voters.
</P>
<P>
   While Gates' company took an official position against the
Washington measure and donated to the unsuccessful campaign to
block its passage, the Microsoft chairman seemed to go out of his
way Thursday to say that his gift was not motivated by the divisive
fight over the measure. ``I would be doing this gift in exactly
this way, independent of that or any other political questions
around the issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gates has stoutly rejected calls to characterize himself as a
liberal or a conservative or something else, and true to form, he
also parried a question about his political affiliation. ``I
wouldn't say that I'm either clearly a Democrat or a Republican,''
he said in the interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think the Republican Party often does a good job of
looking at what kind of environment you have to have to encourage
wealth creation, and seems to have some good thinking in those
areas, whether it be free trade or whatever,'' he said. ``And the
Democratic Party often seems to be thinking more about once you
have the wealth, how you spread it around, and those are both
things I think are very important.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people attack the wealth-creation mechanisms, it seems to
push me in one direction,'' Gates said, smiling as he continued to
explain his nonaffiliation, ``and when they don't take spreading
the wealth seriously, well, that pushes me in the other
direction.''

ENERGY DEPT. TO EXPAND PLAN ON HELPING NUCLEAR WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky., Tenn., Ohio, Pa.)   (bl)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Energy Department said Thursday that it would
expand its proposal to compensate contractor workers made sick by
nuclear weapons work to include workers at the uranium-processing
plant in Paducah, Ky., and would ask Congress for money to increase
medical monitoring and cleanup at similar processing plants in
Tennessee and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said in August that the
department would seek to extend the benefits that are routinely
provided to federal employees to the contractor workers in
Pennsylvania who processed beryllium, a metal used almost
exclusively in nuclear weapons. Richardson went to Paducah on
Thursday to participate in a community meeting and describe the
extension of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The three processing plants separated isotopes of uranium to
isolate the kind most useful for bombs and power plants.
</P>
<P>
   The department has acknowledged for years that the plants,
especially the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, also processed
uranium with some plutonium in it. The Washington Post reported in
August that plutonium may have made workers sick at the Paducah
plant.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of energy for
environment, safety and health, said in a telephone interview that
the Clinton administration was trying to determine whether other
workers had been made ill, and whether they were being fairly
treated under state workmen's compensation programs.
</P>
<P>
   The administration will propose spending $21.8 million,
including $7 million for medical monitoring and $14.8 million for
accelerated cleanup efforts at Paducah and at Portsmouth, Ohio. The
third gaseous diffusion plant is at Oak Ridge, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal has set off new arguments about the allocation of
resources at the Energy Department. Representative Ted Strickland,
an Ohio Democrat whose district includes the Portsmouth plant,
said, ``If people have been harmed, we ought to know that and
accept responsibility, regardless of where.''
</P>
<P>
   Strickland said he was told by several department officials that
they wanted to include all three uranium processing plants, but
that the Defense Department, which has numerous contractor
employees who may also have been exposed to radiation, and the
Justice Department, which represents the federal government in
court cases, thought this would set a bad precedent. The program at
Paducah, whose costs the Energy Department has not stated, is
described as a pilot program.

LAWYERS IN BIAS SUIT ASSERT COCA-COLA SHRED DOCUMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)   (bl)  
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In documents filed late Thursday, the lawyers for four black
employees of Coca-Cola Co., who have filed a lawsuit accusing the
company of discriminating against blacks in pay, promotions and
performance evaluations, said they had evidence that Coca-Cola
executives were shredding documents that might be relevant to the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, Cyrus Mehri, asked U.S.
District Court Judge Richard Story for sanctions against the
company. He cited a June 23 letter from William Clineburg, one of
Coca-Cola's lawyers, denying the existence of shredders in a room
being used to assemble documents for the company's defense. In the
letter, Clineburg wrote, ``No data are being destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehri said an anonymous letter he received in June said that
Coke had set up a ``document destruction room'' to get rid of
documents related to the suit, which is seeking class-action status
to include as many as 1,500 past or present black employees.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed April 22 in U.S. District Court in Atlanta by
four past and current employees. They said that, on average, Coke
paid its black employees nearly $27,000 a year less than white
employees.
</P>
<P>
   The letter Mehri said he received describes the room as having
``a 24-hour operation'' and security surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   According to the motion filed Thursday, Room 7 of the Learning
Center was set up with some urgency late in May. Paul Markley, an
employee described in court documents as saying he helped set up
the room, said another employee, Ginny Sutton, ``requested that a
shredder be placed in Room 7.'' The motion also cites a custodian
who said he removed ``bags of shredded material from outside Room
7.''
</P>
<P>
   A Coke spokesman, Ben Deutsch, said in a statement, ``This
accusation is nothing more than an irresponsible attempt by
plaintiffs' counsel to seed erroneous information in the public and
maliciously attack the integrity and ethics of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutsch acknowledged there was a room set up as described, but
said no shredding was taking place. ``There has never been a
shredder,'' he said. ``No discoverable information is being
destroyed or altered.''

 &HT;    Relatives recall ordeal, shock of church shooting
 &HT;    By Mike Leggett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Laurie Ayn's voice, never loud, was a little
girl's voice, struggling to be strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy, I just wanted you to know we were OK,'' she said.
``Daniel got out, but we don't think one of our friends did.''
Ten-thirty at night, and the network news had just become a very
real intruder in our family's life.
</P>
<P>
   My oldest daughter, 24 years old and a graduate student at
Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, was
working in the nursery at Wedgwood Baptist Church when guns started
going off Wednesday night. She made one of the first 911 calls for
help.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Daniel Cox, 28, was standing in the rear of the
church sanctuary with their friend Shawn Brown, 23, when the gunman
began shooting at the two of them. ``He (Brown) died,'' Laurie Ayn
said Thursday morning, talking now in a speedy monotone. ``He and
his wife live right behind us. He's a student. He and Daniel taught
a fifth-grade class (at church). We taught Vacation Bible School
together.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Daniel strolled over to Shawn's side when he entered
the front door of the church. They slipped into the sanctuary
through a rear door and joined a regular Wednesday night song
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were standing in the back of the sanctuary singing when we
heard these loud bangs,'' Daniel said. Apparently that was the
moment when gunman Larry Gene Ashbrook killed two people at the
church's front door, then began moving toward another rear
sanctuary door, firing as he went. ``We looked out into the foyer
and it was really smoky. When we peeked down the hall, he started
shooting at us. It doesn't sound like it does on TV. As we ducked
back through the door, I saw the glass break. It was like in slow
motion.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no movie moment of locked eyes or recognition, just
adrenaline and shock. ``All I saw was a blur,'' he said. ``The door
kind of shielded us for a second. When I peeked around it, there
was just a dark form, shooting . . . at us, at people out in the
foyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Other friends and church members were killed and wounded as the
tragedy played itself out, leaving the young couple among those
wondering what happened and pondering the fact that they survived.
Like other parents in these unimaginable circumstances, I was
washed in guilt-scented relief, even as I tried to draw each of
them out enough for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the nursery and didn't hear anything,'' Laurie Ayn
said. ``I just saw all these people running out and crying and
telling me to call 911. The lady told me to get down on the floor
and I did. That's when Daniel came running in to check on me. He
said, `I'm OK but I'm going back to get the kids.' Then we started
getting our preschoolers out the side door and across the street
where they would be safe.''
</P>
<P>
   After the relief of finding his wife safe, Daniel realized that
his friend Shawn wasn't with him.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, my son-in-law was subdued, almost robotic as he tried
to absorb the reality of his friend's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a guy, you always think, `What would I do in this
situation?' '' Daniel said. ``Would I be able to stop the guy from
hurting people? But your first instinct is to run, and my thought
was, `What if there's somebody else in the part of the church where
Laurie is?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I think maybe there was something I could have done,
thrown a chair or something,'' Daniel said. And even though Shawn
Brown was found some distance away from where he and Daniel first
were shot at, there's the question of whether he could have done
more to help. ``I do wish I'd turned around and picked up Shawn and
gotten him out of the church.''
</P>
<P>
   It took several phone calls to track down Laurie Ayn and Daniel
on Thursday morning. They were in church.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to chapel at the seminary to do some crying and
praying and start getting over the shock,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still in shock. Last night was just numb,'' Laurie Ayn
said. ``I saw stuff during a tornado in college, but never anything
like this, people hurt and bleeding. There was one lady sitting
outside my door who was bleeding from her head. She was either shot
or hit by something when the bomb went off.''
</P>
<P>
   Wedgwood Baptist is an older church that draws its membership
from families in the neighborhood around it and students from the
nearby seminary. The quiet and solitude it once offered stand in
stark contrast to Wednesday night's mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just surreal that you were there,'' she said. ``You were
a part of it. That's you and your friends on television, but it's
not really happening. We all thought church was a safe place,
especially our church.''
</P>
<P>
   But the young couple plan to go back. ``We won't be able to get
back in the church for a while,'' Daniel said. ``But we'll meet
somewhere. That's where we go.''

THROW DOWN YOUR HOT DOGS, JOIN GREAT AREA CODE REBELLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURIE NOTARO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
PHOENIX - Shhhh.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't tell anybody, but I just called my mom and got through
using the plain old, seven-digit number.
</P>
<P>
   I think the phone company forgot about me.
</P>
<P>
   I'm hoping so, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know about you, but I hate this new sys tem. I'm never
sur prised anymore when some face less Arizona Board of This, That
and The Other Thing makes some stupid _ actually, it's the kind of
stupid spelled with two Os, as in ``stoopid'' _ decision that con
cerns the common good of our city, but somehow never bothers to ask
the common good.
</P>
<P>
   You know what I mean, like when someone sneaks downtown one
morning with a bulldozer before the sun comes up to smash and
flatten a historic building so we can park some more cars in front
of the new morgue, despite the fact that dead folks typically
aren't big drivers. Or when someone else wants to build a sports
stadium, saddles you and me with the bill and then still has the
nerve to charge us FOUR WHOLE BUCKS for a hot dog that will turn
your intestines into stone.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you hear on the nightly news someone decided to change
your phone number without asking you, only to find you're going to
be charged for it, too. Comes straight out of your pocket. Didn't
think that the state was gonna swallow that horse pill, did you?
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. According to the USWest.com Web site, ``Because
the area code modification is the re sult of normal growth in
Arizona, if any costs are incurred for updating systems and
revising printed materi als, they are the responsibility of in
dividual telephone customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Excuse me? Normal growth? Normal growth of what, a magic
beanstalk? If I ever saw anything in my yard or in my house that
grew as quickly as the size and popula tion of Phoenix, I'd kill
it. Out-and-out strike it dead. The only thing I know for sure
which ``nor mally'' grows that fast is cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But paying for the change is only part of the reason I'm mad,
aside from the fact that we didn't get any free hot dogs in this
transaction, ei ther, which is a testament to the stoopidity of our
elected leadership. The city could do anything it wanted as long as
it gave out free hot dogs. People love free hot dogs. They'll buy a
car from you if you give them a free hot dog. They'll come to the
grand opening of your store if you give them a free hot dog.
They'll forgive sin and vote for you for a free hot dog.
</P>
<P>
   You could change their phone numbers and then charge them for
it, and they wouldn't care. They're too busy smiling, chewing on
free hot dogs and asking for spicy mus tard. But here's my problem:
I don't want three more digits added to my phone number. Neither
does my mother, my sister, or anyone else I know. We can't handle
memorizing any more numbers. I can't do one more. There is no more
room. My RAM is full.
</P>
<P>
   I gave up my block of memory concerning birthdays, anniversaries
and special events to make room for the time it takes different
brands of microwave popcorn to cook. I relin quished my entire high
school expe rience to accommodate more than 2,000 versions of my
user IDs and passwords for eBay, Amazon.com and CDnow. Luckily in
college I drank a lot, so I was able to store other people's e-mail
addresses in that folder because there was an abundance of extra
blackout space. I gladly purged some Bad Boyfriend Flashbacks into
the trash to make way for the four numbers added to my ZIP code,
and I dumped what little retention I had of math in or der to
remember my debit card PIN number and which of the remote controls
go to the VCR, TV and ca ble box.
</P>
<P>
   Now they want me to remember three more numerical figures?
</P>
<P>
   I can't do it. I am dry. My sponge is full. I HAVE NOTHING LEFT
TO GIVE.
</P>
<P>
   Memory is not like hate. It doesn't just multiply! It's like pa
tience. You only get a certain allot ment when you're born, and
every year you watch more and more of it slip away.
</P>
<P>
   In the first place, I don't under stand how we could have just
``run out of numbers.'' To me, that just seems impossible. In fact,
I believe it's a lazy reason. I don't know any one with a 000- or a
666-prefix, do you? Maybe it's because I threw math away, but if
you mix up enough numbers, doesn't that just make _ I don't know _
infinity? Start using the star and the pound sign in prefixes for
all I care. Throw in a flash and a redial, but don't mess with what
I already know and have on file in my head.
</P>
<P>
   With three separate area codes, I sense other crises as well.
</P>
<P>
   The way I see it, we're playing a dangerous game. Not only with
in formation overload, but with the very fabric of our community.
</P>
<P>
   Once you start assigning people categories and groups,
competition starts. Rivalries flare up. Elitism slips in and takes
a strong hold.
</P>
<P>
   Area codes and their border streets will become the new Berlin
walls.
</P>
<P>
   On the black market, 480 num bers with tony Scottsdale prefixes
will be selling like they were coo ing, pudgy, blue-eyed babies,
and will become the most prominent and prestigious status symbol
since calf implants and koi ponds.
</P>
<P>
   Families will be torn apart and divided, people will defect into
``The 480'' via hot air balloons and hang gliders launched from
Camel back Mountain, and will easily re nounce their 623 and 602
origins without a hint of hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   I think we'll see it in the singles ads first:
</P>
<P>
   ``You: Slothlike smoker with no general ambition other than
eating and shopping. Looks and hygiene not important, only inner
beauty. Me: Heir to Yoo-hoo and Funyon fortunes, have free samples
for life. Just a generous zillionaire looking for someone to share
my fantastic wealth with. 480s only. No others need apply. Require
proof with phone records.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a city-wide disaster waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   I'm watching, ready to witness this city tear itself apart from
the in side out because of three little num bers, to listen to
chaos and anger reign, to cry as a 623 brother arms himself against
his 602 brother.
</P>
<P>
   To hear the sounds of antipathy and loathing come to life,
echoing through the valleys of this city in a roar too deafening to
drown out, un til someone points to what is falling from the sky
and yells:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, look you guys! Free hot dogs!'' &QL;

TEXAS SHOOTER WAS ANGRY LONER, NEIGHBORS SAY  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ADDS quote from neighbor about Ashbrook pushing his father around
in 12th graf of 2nd take) (rk) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The man who walked into the Wedgwood Baptist
Church here on Wednesday did not look like he belonged to the
congregation. No one apparently knew Larry Gene Ashbrook or what
this man in blue jeans and a black leather jacket might want.
People would later learn that he was a jobless loner, an ex-sailor
prone to foul moods and feared by several of his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   But at that moment, the only thing that seemed strange was that
he was smoking a cigarette in church. A janitor approached him
about the cigarette, and the authorities say Ashbrook shot him. He
shot a woman sitting nearby in the head. And then he followed the
sounds of music and voices into the main sanctuary where hundreds
of teen-agers had gathered for a contemporary Christian music
concert. He walked inside and began firing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were crying,'' said Bob Bollinger, a Sunday school
director. ``They didn't understand it. They were in shock.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the night was over, seven people were killed, three
of them teen-agers, and Ashbrook became the eighth fatality when he
turned the gun on himself. Seven other people were wounded, two of
whom remained in critical condition Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators gathered evidence about Ashbrook's rampage and
as local officials sought to comfort a grieving city, the suspect
emerged as an angry, desperate man who apparently had called two
local newspapers in recent months to say he fantasized about serial
killers.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton decried the attack and offered
the nation's sympathy to the victims, their families and the people
of Fort Worth. ``Yet again, we have seen a sanctuary violated by
gun violence, taking children brimming with faith and promise and
hope, before their time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential front runner,
canceled campaign appearances Thursday in Michigan and went to the
hospital in Fort Worth to comfort the families of the victims. Even
as people expressed horror that such a brutal attack could happen
in a house of worship, Fort Worth Mayor Kenneth Barr alluded to the
recent string of mass shootings across the country, notably the
school attack at Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fort Worth isn't the first place to have this kind of
tragedy,'' Barr said. ``My great fear is it won't be the last.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Mendoza, the Fort Worth acting police chief, said
Ashbrook, 47, apparently screamed insults about ``the Baptist
religion'' during the shooting, but investigators had not yet
discerned his motives. Ashbrook did not leave a suicide note or any
written evidence of his intentions, the police chief said. He lived
several miles from Wedgwood Baptist, and members of the church had
no idea why he chose them as a target.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was saying, `Your religion is nothing, it's not worth
anything, it means nothing,''' said Mary Beth Talley, 17, who was
wounded in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Local police and federal agents with the FBI and the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Thursday morning searched the home
Ashbrook had shared with his late parents and uncovered the raw
materials for a pipe bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said Ashbrook threw a pipe bomb into the front of the
sanctuary during his attack.
</P>
<P>
   Officers also found at the house what Mendoza called ``ledgers''
or ``journals.'' Mendoza said: ``These were things sometimes that
were written as far back as possibly the 1980s and are complaints.
He's complaining about people. He's complaining about his job. He
believes people are out to get him.''
</P>
<P>
   As details from the shootings emerged, church members told of
acts of heroism. As Ashbrook sprayed bullets from two handguns,
teenagers ducked for cover in the pews. But Heather McDonald, a
young woman with Down's Syndrome, remained sitting upright,
apparently confused. Ms. Talley shielded the girl with her body as
the suspect fired and hit her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just kept saying to Heather, `You've got to be quiet and
stay down with me,''' Ms. Talley said Thursday. Even after she was
shot, Ms. Talley kept comforting her friend. ``I just wanted to
make sure she was calm.''
</P>
<P>
   Another church member, S.M. ``Chip'' Gillette, was watching
television in his nearby home when he noticed his dog, Jake,
standing atop a chest and barking furiously at the window. An off
duty Fort Worth police officer, Gillette saw people streaming out
of the church. He radioed for police help, grabbed his service
revolver and rushed inside the front door with a uniformed officer
who had just arrived at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette said he ran toward the gunshots and arrived just after
Ashbrook shot himself as he sat in a back pew of the church.
Investigators said Ashbrook used semi-automatic handguns, a 9 mm
Ruger and a .380-caliber AMT. He fired at least 30 shots, and
officers found 10 Ruger ammunition clips in his pockets and near
his body. He bought both guns in February 1992 at licensed firearms
dealers in a flea market-type operation called Trader's Village,
just outside Fort Worth, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that Ashbrook may have brought more than one pipe bomb
into the church, investigators had sent in robotic bomb-sweeping
equipment in the hours after the attack. No other explosives were
found, and the bodies of the victims were removed from the
sanctuary early Thursday morning, about five hours after the
attack.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To a large degree, Ashbrook remains a puzzle to investigators.
At least publicly, Mendoza and other officials said they weren't
certain of his motives. However, he had apparently called the local
Fort Worth Star-Telegram and an alternative newspaper, FW Weekly in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
   In an angry, rambling discourse, Ashbrook told a reporter at FW
Weekly that he fantasized about serial killers, particularly Ricky
Lee Green, a mass murderer who was from Fort Worth who was executed
in 1997 for four killings in Texas and was linked to at least eight
other deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook lived in modest brick ranch house in Forest Hills, a
lower-middle-class bedroom community in southeast Fort Worth, about
seven miles from the church. At age 47, Ashbrook was the youngest
of five siblings, and he lived at home with his elderly father,
Jack, until he died two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   His father had retired after 35 years as a switchman for the
Missouri-Kansas-Texas railroad, and had been a fixture at the
Pleasant Ridge Church of Christ for 40 years. Neighbors said the
suspect had been close to his mother, Ethel Muriel Ashbrook, who
died in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could never tell what kind of mood swing he was in, so I
kept away from him,'' said Venita Hord, 50, who lived directly
across the street. ``I never did trust him.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, as Mrs. Hord and another neighbor sat in her
yard, Ashbrook pulled up and saw them laughing. Apparently thinking
he was laughing at him, he slammed shut his car door and unzipped
his pants, exposing himself. Mrs. Hord said she had not spoken to
him since, even though she saw him almost every day.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said Ashbrook had apparently never been treated for any
mental illness nor sought any such help. His police record shows
only one arrest, a 1971 conviction for marijuana possession.
</P>
<P>
   Records show that Ashbrook had a spotty education record and was
in and out of the U.S. Navy. He enrolled in Tarrant County College
in 1971, when he was 19, taking classes in remedial English,
creative design, math, guitar and physical education. He served at
least two stints in the Navy, the second from 1977 to 1983,
according to a spokesman for the Department of Veterans Affairs in
Dallas. In the Navy, he was a sonar operator on a P-3 Orion plane.
That type of plane tracks and destroys enemy submarines.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said he rarely spoke to anyone. Mrs. Horde said she
knew when he was home because he always slammed the door shut and
often kicked it open. She said she could hear the noise across the
street. Other neighbors often heard him arguing with his father,
sometimes over borrowing his car. And everyone noticed one strange
habit: he always carried a blue canvas bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never knew what his attitude would be,'' said Janet
Gabhardt, 28, another neighbor. Asked if she was shocked that
Ashbrook had become violent, she said, ``I wasn't shocked, I wasn't
shocked at all.'' Childhood friends remembered him as a loner and
an oddball who mumbled and talked to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry had turned weird,'' said James Branum, who grew up a
block away and last saw Ashbrook six months ago. ``He was always
strange to me a little bit.'' Branum and others said he never held
a steady job. ``He wouldn't work,'' Branum said. ``When his daddy
died he got the house because nobody was left, but he couldn't pay
for it. I guess he figured everything was so bad he took his own
life. It's so sad with all these kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Another neighbor, Patricia Wright, said that Ashbrook often
pushed his father around. ``When his father would pull up he would
pull him and push him out of the way and take the car.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, the sanctuary at Wedgwood Baptist was filled
with teen-agers from several area churches who had gathered to
celebrate ``See You at the Pole,'' a national movement to affirm
the Christian faith of schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The police said Ashbrook paced back and forth in the back of the
sanctuary, firing several times into the congregation. He reloaded
two or three times, then lit the fuse to his pipe bomb and tossed
it to the front of the church. The bomb exploded, sending shrapnel
into the walls and floor, but Mendoza said it caused little damage.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Gillette, the off-duty officer, and the uniformed
officer rushed into the sanctuary, Ashbrook pointed the Ruger at
his own head and pulled the trigger. Asked if the shooting had
shaken his religious faith, Gillette answered, ``If it affects your
faith, you have no faith.''
</P>
<P>
   At least two prayer services were held Thursday, and Gillette
said the church planned to hold two services at the sanctuary on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, one of the last people who saw Ashbrook before he
drove to the church was a neighbor, Matthew White. White said he
had been praying earlier in the day and felt a calling from God to
take Ashbrook to church. He said he did not know Ashbrook and had
never spoken to him but regarded him as lonely and desperate. ``It
was such a strong thought I said I was going to do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But White saw Ashbrook in his car early Wednesday evening and
assumed ``I'd missed the opportunity.'' As White and his wife drove
to church, he said he kept thinking about Ashbrook. White, who is
black, thought Ashbrook might be uncomfortable in his church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking, `I wonder what church could I send him to?'''

A NEW STRATEGY: MORE BLUSTER BEFORE THE BLOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Before his last big fight, against Ike Quartey,
Oscar De La Hoya spent a lot of time thinking about losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were talking about how strong a puncher he was,'' De La
Hoya said of that Feb. 13 fight. ``That got me nervous and made me
hesitant in the fight. But never will that happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, the World Boxing Council welterweight champion, was
knocked down in that fight, but finished with a ferocious flurry in
the 12th round and pulled out a split decision. Afterward he said
he had given Quartey, and many of his previous opponents, too much
respect.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that was based on De La Hoya's not having an
understanding of just how good he really was. And much of that was
because his promoter, Bob Arum, had coddled him by tossing him in
with opponents who weren't his equal in talent and skill. The
tactic, and some deft marketing, made De La Hoya a wealthy boxing
celebrity but had allowed doubts to creep in.
</P>
<P>
   As De La Hoya (31-0), now 26, prepares to take on Felix Trinidad
Jr. (35-0), the International Boxing Federation champion in a major
welterweight showdown at the Mandalay Bay Casino on Saturday night,
he is taking a completely different tack than he did against
Quartey _ at least publicly. He isn't praising Trinidad. He is even
denigrating Trinidad's boxing skills, saying Trinidad can't move
laterally, has poor footwork, fights off-balance and doesn't have
good hand speed.
</P>
<P>
   During a news conference on Wednesday, De La Hoya measured
himself against Trinidad and in his own estimation he came out
ahead of the Puerto Rican champion in all categories. He even rated
Quartey ahead of Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a solid fighter, an all-around good fighter,'' De La Hoya
said of Trinidad. ``I told Trinidad that I respect him as a
fighter. He's got all the tools necessary to become a good fighter.
But if you talk about the whole package, the footwork, the speed,
the power and the intelligence in the ring, Ike Quartey was a
stronger fighter, had the upper body movement and was smarter in
the ring.''
</P>
<P>
   But listen to De La Hoya long enough, and contradictions begin
to creep into his conversations about this fight. In one breath he
said he believes that Quartey was his career defining fight. But in
another he said that a victory against Trinidad would be a
monumental achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fight is going to have a huge impact in my boxing
career,'' De La Hoya said. ``It's going to put me up there with the
greats.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he is not getting caught up in all the hype, but he
knows that it is an event of great magnitude. He is guaranteed $15
million for the bout, his largest paycheck to date, and Arum has
guaranteed him another $6 million based on other revenue from the
fight. It could be the highest grossing nonheavyweight bout in
history, attracting close to a million viewers on the TVKO pay per
view. De La Hoya gets a share of the revenue from all the
pay-per-view buys above 850,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, De La Hoya said he has let those types of things
interfere with his concentration for the fight. Before he fought
Quartey, he had entered into a partnership as a co-promoter with
Arum. He later dropped out of the arrangement, because it was a
mental strain and was affecting the way he boxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always well trained, always in good shape,'' De La Hoya
said. ``I'd never cheat my fans that way. But it's the mind. The
focus just wasn't there. When you're in the position I'm in and
with all the money that you're making, it's very tough. It's hard
to focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad might have caught De La Hoya's attention by predicting
that he will knock De La Hoya out in the sixth round of the fight.
De La Hoya said there is no personal animosity on his part toward
Trinidad, but De La Hoya certainly won't forget that prediction
when the fight rolls around. De La Hoya punished Julio Cesar Chavez
in their second fight, after he felt Chavez had not given him the
proper credit for beating Chavez in the first fight. Chavez said
that had the fight not been stopped on a cut, he would have beaten
De La Hoya. In the second fight De La Hoya forced Chavez, who was
cut and bleeding inside his mouth, to quit in his corner before the
eighth round.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he has tuned out what the public says about
Trinidad's punching power or his boxing ability, De La Hoya is
apparently listening to his trainer Robert Alcazar and Gil Clancy.
They did film studies of Trinidad to help De La Hoya prepare. Then
they took De La Hoya to his training camp at Big Bear, Calif., for
three months to put everything into action. It was the longest
training camp of his career. He usually trains five weeks for a
fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see Oscar in his best shape ever,'' Alcazar said
when asked why De La Hoya was in camp for so long.
</P>
<P>
   The mantra of Alcazar and Clancy has been that De La Hoya is
faster and stronger than Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faster hand speed, foot speed, better punching power, better
combinations, fighting better opponents and Oscar always comes
through in the clutch. He has all that going for him,'' Clancy
said.
</P>
<P>
   After three months of listening to the mantra, De La Hoya has
begun to repeat it, and he must believe it, because he talks about
nothing else in this fight. If it isn't the case, he could be in
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   For now, De La Hoya isn't worried about that. He is supremely
confident that he will beat Trinidad and the same doubts that
plagued him before he fought Quartey are gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really wants this fight badly,'' Clancy said. ``He feels
this will be his crowning achievement as a welterweight.''

EDITORIAL: LESSONS IN THE SCHOOL TEST DATA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Sept. 17:
</P>
<P>
   There is an encouraging bright spot buried under all the
confusion and recriminations generated by New York City's
comic-opera attempts to end social promotions in the public
schools. It turns out, we are now told, that reading-test scores
for the city's schoolchildren went up sharply this spring instead
of remaining flat as originally reported.
</P>
<P>
   It would be dangerous to attach too much significance to such
comparisons in a year when the standardized tests have been
radically changed. But if these revised numbers mean anything, they
offer heartening proof that something is beginning to go right at
the classroom level in the beleaguered New York City school system.
</P>
<P>
   That does not absolve the school system, or its testing company,
CTB/McGraw-Hill, for the appalling fiascoes that have marred this
first year's attempt to hold back children who failed standardized
tests for promotion in the spring and then failed again in a second
attempt at summer school. True, the city's first mandatory summer
school _ for children who failed tests at the end of the third,
sixth and eighth grades _ was bound to be hectic, given that the
Board of Education rushed into it with little preparation under
political pressure from City Hall. But that is no excuse for
failing to keep accurate attendance records to determine whether
the right children actually showed up, nor does it justify an
apparent failure to communicate well with families about the need
for summer school.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the most disturbing fiasco of all, comes word that a
mistake in scoring the pivotal spring tests led the school system
to order more than 8,600 students to attend summer school who had
actually passed those tests. Of these, some 3,500 were subsequently
held back for failing to show up at summer school or for flunking
the tests there even though they had passed them before. The chief
blame for this sad affair apparently lies with CTB/McGraw-Hill,
which miscalculated when it transformed students' raw scores into
an assessment of where they stood with respect to schoolchildren
nationally. The only positive note is that correcting the error
revealed a system-wide gain on the reading examination of nearly 5
percent compared with the year before.
</P>
<P>
   This page has supported tougher standards and higher
expectations for New York City's children. But the error by
CTB/McGraw-Hill has thrown a Klieg light on what happens when a
system bases momentous decisions on a single, standardized test.
This problem vindicates the Board of Education's recent decision to
move toward multiple criteria that include not only tests but also
grades, student portfolios and the teacher's sense of whether or
not the student has mastered the material.
</P>
<P>
   Such systems require more work to develop and maintain, but they
also minimize the system's vulnerability to statistical errors like
this one _ and protect children from judgments based on a single
bad day at school. But those children and parents also need to be
protected from sloppy management.

THROW DOWN YOUR HOT DOGS, JOIN GREAT AREA CODE REBELLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURIE NOTARO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
PHOENIX - Shhhh.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't tell anybody, but I just called my mom and got through
using the plain old, seven-digit number.
</P>
<P>
   I think the phone company forgot about me.
</P>
<P>
   I'm hoping so, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know about you, but I hate this new sys tem. I'm never
sur prised anymore when some face less Arizona Board of This, That
and The Other Thing makes some stupid _ actually, it's the kind of
stupid spelled with two Os, as in ``stoopid'' _ decision that con
cerns the common good of our city, but somehow never bothers to ask
the common good.
</P>
<P>
   You know what I mean, like when someone sneaks downtown one
morning with a bulldozer before the sun comes up to smash and
flatten a historic building so we can park some more cars in front
of the new morgue, despite the fact that dead folks typically
aren't big drivers. Or when someone else wants to build a sports
stadium, saddles you and me with the bill and then still has the
nerve to charge us FOUR WHOLE BUCKS for a hot dog that will turn
your intestines into stone.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you hear on the nightly news someone decided to change
your phone number without asking you, only to find you're going to
be charged for it, too. Comes straight out of your pocket. Didn't
think that the state was gonna swallow that horse pill, did you?
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. According to the USWest.com Web site, ``Because
the area code modification is the re sult of normal growth in
Arizona, if any costs are incurred for updating systems and
revising printed materi als, they are the responsibility of in
dividual telephone customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Excuse me? Normal growth? Normal growth of what, a magic
beanstalk? If I ever saw anything in my yard or in my house that
grew as quickly as the size and popula tion of Phoenix, I'd kill
it. Out-and-out strike it dead. The only thing I know for sure
which ``nor mally'' grows that fast is cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But paying for the change is only part of the reason I'm mad,
aside from the fact that we didn't get any free hot dogs in this
transaction, ei ther, which is a testament to the stoopidity of our
elected leadership. The city could do anything it wanted as long as
it gave out free hot dogs. People love free hot dogs. They'll buy a
car from you if you give them a free hot dog. They'll come to the
grand opening of your store if you give them a free hot dog.
They'll forgive sin and vote for you for a free hot dog.
</P>
<P>
   You could change their phone numbers and then charge them for
it, and they wouldn't care. They're too busy smiling, chewing on
free hot dogs and asking for spicy mus tard. But here's my problem:
I don't want three more digits added to my phone number. Neither
does my mother, my sister, or anyone else I know. We can't handle
memorizing any more numbers. I can't do one more. There is no more
room. My RAM is full.
</P>
<P>
   I gave up my block of memory concerning birthdays, anniversaries
and special events to make room for the time it takes different
brands of microwave popcorn to cook. I relin quished my entire high
school expe rience to accommodate more than 2,000 versions of my
user IDs and passwords for eBay, Amazon.com and CDnow. Luckily in
college I drank a lot, so I was able to store other people's e-mail
addresses in that folder because there was an abundance of extra
blackout space. I gladly purged some Bad Boyfriend Flashbacks into
the trash to make way for the four numbers added to my ZIP code,
and I dumped what little retention I had of math in or der to
remember my debit card PIN number and which of the remote controls
go to the VCR, TV and ca ble box.
</P>
<P>
   Now they want me to remember three more numerical figures?
</P>
<P>
   I can't do it. I am dry. My sponge is full. I HAVE NOTHING LEFT
TO GIVE.
</P>
<P>
   Memory is not like hate. It doesn't just multiply! It's like pa
tience. You only get a certain allot ment when you're born, and
every year you watch more and more of it slip away.
</P>
<P>
   In the first place, I don't under stand how we could have just
``run out of numbers.'' To me, that just seems impossible. In fact,
I believe it's a lazy reason. I don't know any one with a 000- or a
666-prefix, do you? Maybe it's because I threw math away, but if
you mix up enough numbers, doesn't that just make _ I don't know _
infinity? Start using the star and the pound sign in prefixes for
all I care. Throw in a flash and a redial, but don't mess with what
I already know and have on file in my head.
</P>
<P>
   With three separate area codes, I sense other crises as well.
</P>
<P>
   The way I see it, we're playing a dangerous game. Not only with
in formation overload, but with the very fabric of our community.
</P>
<P>
   Once you start assigning people categories and groups,
competition starts. Rivalries flare up. Elitism slips in and takes
a strong hold.
</P>
<P>
   Area codes and their border streets will become the new Berlin
walls.
</P>
<P>
   On the black market, 480 num bers with tony Scottsdale prefixes
will be selling like they were coo ing, pudgy, blue-eyed babies,
and will become the most prominent and prestigious status symbol
since calf implants and koi ponds.
</P>
<P>
   Families will be torn apart and divided, people will defect into
``The 480'' via hot air balloons and hang gliders launched from
Camel back Mountain, and will easily re nounce their 623 and 602
origins without a hint of hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   I think we'll see it in the singles ads first:
</P>
<P>
   ``You: Slothlike smoker with no general ambition other than
eating and shopping. Looks and hygiene not important, only inner
beauty. Me: Heir to Yoo-hoo and Funyon fortunes, have free samples
for life. Just a generous zillionaire looking for someone to share
my fantastic wealth with. 480s only. No others need apply. Require
proof with phone records.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a city-wide disaster waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   I'm watching, ready to witness this city tear itself apart from
the in side out because of three little num bers, to listen to
chaos and anger reign, to cry as a 623 brother arms himself against
his 602 brother.
</P>
<P>
   To hear the sounds of antipathy and loathing come to life,
echoing through the valleys of this city in a roar too deafening to
drown out, un til someone points to what is falling from the sky
and yells:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, look you guys! Free hot dogs!'' &QL;

TYSON SAYS HE HAS LOST 45 OF 60 EXTRA POUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Having trimmed 45 of the 60 pounds that he gained
during a three-and-a-half month stay in a Maryland jail, Mike Tyson
said today that he was close to being ready for his Oct. 23
heavyweight bout against Orlin Norris at the MGM Grand Casino here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went from 280 pounds to 235 pounds,'' Tyson said during a
news conference at the MGM Grand to announce the fight. ``By fight
time, I'll be right. I'm looking forward to it. It's not going to
be a walk in the park. But it's not going to be a walk in the park
for him either.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, 33, last fought on Jan. 16, knocking out Francois Botha
in the fifth round of a bout that Botha had dominated through the
first four rounds. Tyson was sentenced to one year in jail in
Montgomery County, Md., on Feb. 5 on assault charges stemming from
an altercation following a traffic accident on Aug. 31, 1998. He
was released May 24.
</P>
<P>
   He indicated Thursday that his big weight gain was a result of
his inactivity in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever been incarcerated?'' Tyson asked a reporter who
questioned him about the weight gain. ``Go out, hit somebody with a
car, get incarcerated and see how fat you'll get.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, 33, said it had taken him just two months to shed the
bulk of the weight by running five miles a day and sparring 10
rounds a day on the heavy bag. But he still wants to trim down to
221 pounds for the bout against Norris (50-5), a lightly regarded
heavyweight who is the brother of Terry Norris, a former junior
middleweight champion.
</P>
<P>
   Orlin Norris, who will turn 34 on Oct. 4, said this was the
defining fight of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every fighter looks at a marquee fight they can build upon,''
he said. ``Mike Tyson could be that fight for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, who is 46-3, has welcomed Jay Bright, his former trainer,
back to his corner. Bright will be working with Tommy Brooks, who
joined Tyson for the Botha fight.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson said he was not surprised that he was sentenced to jail
for the fight that followed the automobile accident. He had pleaded
to the misdemeanor assault charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's politically correct to put me in prison,'' Tyson said.
``If go I go to any state, California or Nevada, if you don't put
me away there's a malfunction in your justice system. ''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson said he had planned to fight three to four times this year
to clear up some debts. He owes several million dollars to Showtime
because the cable network paid off delinquent taxes and picked up
the federal tax liens that were placed on his homes in Connecticut
and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no one to blame but myself,'' Tyson said. ``Other
people may have contributed to my problems. But I have to carry the
weight of the fool.''  &QL;

AN EASY GLAMOR PERMEATES BLASS' SPRING COLLECTION

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thursday's Bill Blass show was supposedly his swan
song, though he hasn't officially announced the sale of his
business.
</P>
<P>
   So, there was a frisson of excitement tinged with nostalgia
among the faithful waiting in the Bryant Park tent Thursday morning
for what might be his final fashion statement.
</P>
<P>
   They had slogged through driving rain (or, in the case of his
``ladies,'' been chauffeur-driven), praying that the show would go
on. It did. So did the Jill Stuart show that followed, but Seventh
on Sixth canceled the rest of the afternoon's shows, rescheduling
them for Saturday, because of fears of what Hurricane Floyd's high
winds might do to the tent.
</P>
<P>
   The Blass spring 2000 show made everyone forget about the
pounding rain on the tent's roof, and the occasional leaks.
</P>
<P>
   From the first number _ a color-banded white dress _ to the last
_ a chiffon turtleneck and short silver skirt _ there was never any
doubt that a master was in control.
</P>
<P>
   Every outfit displayed the unmistakable Blass touch. Call it
perfectionism. Call it a vision of how he likes to see women
dressed.
</P>
<P>
   An easy glamour permeated the collection. Cropped sweaters were
paired with floral-beaded skirts or sequin-paved pants _ a look
Blass might have patented. Jackets were loose, unstructured affairs
with soft hoods. Chiffon and organza dresses burst into colorful
bloom, sometimes trailing asymmetric ruffles.
</P>
<P>
   Off-the-shoulder black lace topped a pale pink ball-gown skirt.
And to round out the picture there was a series of those short
black dresses in chiffon and lace that no Blass customer's closet
would be without.
</P>
<P>
   If Thursday's show indeed turns out to be Blass' last, it will
leave his ladies well taken care of.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kors is the designer many people expect to inherit the
Blass mantle for dressing the social set. He had a winning show on
Tuesday, but, as might be expected, it was easily a generation
younger in attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Kors called it ``sexy, indulgent, American sportswear,'' and it
lived up to the billing.
</P>
<P>
   There were microscopically short skirts, in leather that
mimicked guipure lace or in a muted blue and green floral print.
There were skin-tight jeans cropped above the ankle and worn with
sheer cashmere tops or glove-leather jackets.
</P>
<P>
   There were bikinis and cabana jackets, shown with towels wrapped
around the models' heads, as if they had just emerged from a cool
dip.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most of the clothes looked as if they were meant for a
summer at the beach. Just about the only city-ready styles were the
cable-stitched sweaters and the yummy glove leathers, particularly
a short-sleeved shirtdress. To make a shirtdress look sensuous
takes talent, and Kors has it in abundance.
</P>
<P>
   He used flattering colors like pink, lime, lemon, tangerine and
aqua, balanced against bold black-and-white zebra patterns and
leavened with a series of skin tones ranging from the palest pinky
beige to cocoa brown.
</P>
<P>
   For evening, there were the slinky beaded dresses he has made a
specialty and some beaded laces that were less original but just as
sexy.

   After several seasons of showing in Italy, Victor Alfaro brought
his spring collection back to New York. Like Kors, he expects his
customers to spend a lot of time at the beach. He showed swimsuits
that were deeply cut out at the sides and back, paired with snug
leather Capri pants, hip-slung skirts or shorts brief enough to
reveal two crescent moons in back.
</P>
<P>
   Leather punched out to resemble lace has become as common on
spring runways as bare midriffs and denim. And Alfaro had them all.
</P>
<P>
   He also had some lovely embroidered chiffons and lightly
sequined tulles in pale lilac or ivory that had the delicate touch
he has become known for.
</P>
<P>
   So, those thick leather belts with heavy gold rings and the
chain-link thongs were like false notes struck in a Chopin sonata.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Steele is another American in Milan, Italy, who
returned to his roots this season. But his sensibility is
definitely European. No classic American sportswear appears on his
runway. He uses raffia fringe to trim a sweater, cuts the back of a
blouse to shreds, uses zippers for decoration, and bares the sides
of dresses as daringly as he bares the backs.
</P>
<P>
   His collection seesaws from refined tailoring to studded
bondage, from handkerchief-hemmed chiffon to orange and black
paillettes.
</P>
<P>
   Fine strands of chain-link were draped into a halter top worn
with a raffia-feather skirt and an unlined skirt worn with a raffia
halter.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad Steele feels he has to try so hard to be
provocative, to make so many things for the woman with a tough
edge. But fashion can be mighty boring when everyone shows clothes
that are pretty and safe. Fashion, like a good meal, needs a little
spice.

JOHN WHITE, 75, POLITICAL STRATEGIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Md.)   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   John F. White Sr., a political strategist and organizer whose
leadership played a vital role in the election of black officials
in Philadelphia, died Sept. 15 at his home in Philadelphia. He was
75.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, White helped found the Black Political Forum, his
principal political arm.
</P>
<P>
   In the 15 years before the election of W. Wilson Goode as the
first African-American mayor of Philadelphia in 1983, White helped
blacks win election to 10 city offices or seats in the state
Legislature and a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy Williams was the first of this group when he was elected
to the Pennsylvania House in 1970. Williams was followed to the
state Legislature by David Richardson, and then White's son, John
F. White Jr.
</P>
<P>
   William Gray was elected to the U.S. House and became the first
black House member to serve as the Democratic whip.
</P>
<P>
   White used the Black Political Forum to bring local
African-American leaders together, consider ways to maximize their
influence and establish goals and means of achieving them.
</P>
<P>
   In White's last public appearance this week, said David W.
Brown, a longtime friend and a spokesman for the family, ``he was
saying that African-Americans should look beyond race and party
affiliation in making endorsements. They should join their natural
allies, the liberal middle class, which includes both
African-Americans and non-African Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said that White's preaching of political independence was
reflected this week when White's son, who finished third in the
Democratic mayoral primary behind John Street, announced that he
was endorsing Street's Republican opponent, Sam Katz.
</P>
<P>
   White retired in the early 1990s from his job as an assistant
managing director of the city of Philadelphia, an appointive post
with responsibilities that included overseeing the City Watch, a
community policing program that White had helped to establish.
</P>
<P>
   John Felix White was born on June 9, 1924, in Berlin, Md. He
received a bachelor's of science degree in 1944 from Bowie State
College.
</P>
<P>
   He received a certificate of Christian education at Cedar Crest
College and for many years served as deacon at Mount Carmel Baptist
Church in West Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   White's first wife, Sylvia Lewis, died in 1990. In addition to
his son, from the first marriage, White is survived by his wife,
Patricia Washington of Philadelphia; a brother, Otha White of
Maryland; four sisters, Anna Waters, Emma Jones, Eliza Brown and
Barbara Corbin, all of the Philadelphia area; nine grandchildren
and one great-grandchild.

A PRICE FOR EVERYTHING, EVEN TESTAVERDE'S HEEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Vinny Testaverde collapsed to the Giants Stadium turf with
a season-ending torn Achilles' tendon last Sunday, did the New York
Jets' potential sale price plunge?
</P>
<P>
   If the Jets were a publicly traded stock, Testaverde's injury
would have sent shares reeling, just as if a company's earnings had
come in below projections or the sales of a ballyhooed product had
gone into the tank.
</P>
<P>
   Potential buyers seeking to acquire the Jets started to assemble
last month with the expectation that the team might play in the
Super Bowl. Such anticipation had to figure into the price one of
the suitors would pay. Now, with Testaverde out and Rick Mirer in,
the anticipation is considerably muted.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are emotional buys and factors like that can't be ruled
out,'' John Moag, the managing director of the sports industry
group at the investment banking firm Legg Mason, said of the impact
of Testaverde's injury. ``How a team is playing has a psychological
effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Are the Jets now worth $10 million less than they were before 2
p.m. last Sunday? Or did the value drop by $25 million? Or $50
million?
</P>
<P>
   Will the loss of each game lop $5 million from the price? Will
each of Rick Mirer's interceptions cause a $750,000 drop? Will
Wayne Chrebet's return from injury be worth $2.5 million more? Will
each first down be worth $10,000?
</P>
<P>
   The estimated 26 suitors who have signed confidentiality
agreements to examine the Hess estate's sale prospectus know,
however, that winning isn't the only consideration. The Washington
Redskins' 6-10 record last year did not scare Daniel Snyder away
from from buying them for $800 million, a price largely determined
by the cash horde coming from the team's two-year-old stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see the Testaverde situation affecting the value, but
you can say for sure that if the Jets are out of the playoffs early
_ say they're 1-7 or 2-6 _ it takes some glamour off the team,''
said Michael Ozanian of Forbes magazine, which values the Jets at
$363 million in its current issue, slightly more than half the
Dallas Cowboys' value of $663 million.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Ganis, the president of Sportscorp Ltd., a Chicago
consulting firm, added: ``Being without Testaverde shouldn't make a
difference. We're not talking about Peyton Manning or Tim Couch,
quarterbacks in their early 20's, but a guy who's in his 30s and at
the tail end of his career.''
</P>
<P>
   Of greater concern for the value of the Jets, said Ganis and
Ozanian, is the coaching future of Bill Parcells. If he leaves
after a disappointing 1999 season, it would be like Lee Iacocca
leaving Chrysler in the 1980s before the company's recovery was
completed. ``I see Parcells staying on as coach as being worth $10
million or $20 million,'' Ganis said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Jets sell for $500 million or more, it will be because of
the hope of getting a new stadium when the team's Giants Stadium
lease expires in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Jets' suitors are Cablevision's Charles Dolan; New
Jersey Devils owner John McMullen; builders Sam Grossman and Samuel
LeFrak; cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder; New York Mets co-owner Fred
Wilpon, and the tandem of developer Steve Ross and
developer/financier Bill Mack. For whomever wins the bidding, the
biggest challenge might be negotiating an expensive and difficult
buyout with the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority to get a
new stadium and sweetheart lease in place by 2003 or 2004.
</P>
<P>
   With the Nets and the Devils planning arenas away from the
Meadowlands, the authority wouldn't want to make it easy for
another team to leave, especially one that had never squawked about
its lease when Leon Hess was alive.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Sept. 17:
</P>
<P>
   The important thing, of course, is not to get caught up in the
substance of these periodic debates about the rules of the Miss
America Pageant. Whether the issue is swimsuits or the personal
histories of its contestants, the pageant is dependably late in
getting to a sensible policy. It is that perennial lateness, in
fact, that is worth some examination.
</P>
<P>
   In its latest rules flap, the pageant's national board announced
plans to abandon the policy of requiring contestants to affirm that
they had never been married or pregnant. They thought, rightly,
that anyone who was a ``miss'' at contest time ought to be able to
compete. But local pageant directors rebelled. They are fighting to
preserve a tradition of invasion of privacy that began after 1949,
when a Miss America named Jacque Mercer got married and divorced
during her reign.
</P>
<P>
   What really interests us about the issue is the psychology
underlying the attempt to preserve retrograde attitudes. It is
doubtful that the 300,000 citizens who work in state and local
pageants really think virginity is as common as it used to be. What
animates the local pageants is not analysis of the real world, but
nostalgia for a fictionalized American past. In reality, that
small-town past was never as regimentedly virtuous as it appeared,
but its unblemished myth is still a powerful force in American
life. Ronald Reagan built a political career and Walt Disney a
movie studio on the foundation of similar nostalgias about
prelapsarian America.
</P>
<P>
   The Miss America Pageant is a much wackier, less consequential
kind of edifice. Its backwardness could even be taken as endearing
if its longing for an imaginary America did not so regularly take
the form of hurtful and discriminatory rules.

SOSA DESERVES MORE RESPECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hurricane Sammy was sweeping through Cincinnati,
that much everybody knew. Rob Butcher and his Reds media relations
staff couldn't be sure when or where Sosa's historic 60th home run
would make landfall, but they made provisions, just to be safe.
They squirreled away extra seats and tables to handle the media
tsunami.
</P>
<P>
   Like all the South Floridians who cleaned out hardware stores in
anticipation of Hurricane Floyd's arrival, theirs was so much
needless preparation. The Reds' three-game set against the Chicago
Cubs attracted a few more reporters than usual, but nowhere near
the waves of denim and polyester that lapped Cinergy Field last
September when Sosa was nearing the 60 home run mark in his epic
duel with St. Louis slugger Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   By the close of the series Thursday, the extra seats had been
returned to storage. Though usually found at the eye of any storm,
the media hordes in this case were among the first to evacuate.
Whether or not they repaired to higher ground is debatable.
</P>
<P>
   Is it another home run race gathering power and force while the
first is so fresh in our minds that has made the media blase? Or is
it the fact that the player bearing down on history this time isn't
from the good ol' U.S. of A.?
</P>
<P>
   Either way, shame on us.
</P>
<P>
   With his next home run, Sosa will become the first player in
baseball's storied history to achieve back-to-back 60 home run
seasons. It's a milestone, another feather in baseball's cap, and
if people can't get tickled silly about that, well maybe it's
because Sosa's success is striking a nerve far below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, when Sosa became the second man in history to
surpass 61 home runs _ only four days after McGwire became the
first _ nobody outside his native Dominican Republic was quite sure
how to react. His own teammates couldn't have felt more conflicted
if they had been Richard and Oracene Williams at this year's U.S.
Open.
</P>
<P>
   Hail him or hug him? Lionize him or patronize him? Adore him or
ignore him? People's perspectives shifted more capriciously than
the winds at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   For a few, it was a black-and-white issue: McGwire passed Maris
first and that's why he got the car, the curtain calls, the
commissioner's hug, the Maris clan's applause, the king-size
newspaper headlines, the commercials and all the magazine covers.
</P>
<P>
   Others scoffed that it was a black-and-white issue, all right.
At the time, a number of readers wondered if Sosa wasn't getting
second-rate recognition because he is dark-skinned and McGwire is
not. We thought it ludicrous at the time, this raising of the race
card amid all the ``Hit it here, Sammy'' banners.
</P>
<P>
   Then we watched this year as Sosa picked up speed and strength
in August and early September and instead of admiring the force of
nature barreling down on the magical 60 barrier, the American
public yawned as if to say, if you've seen one record assault,
you've seen them all.
</P>
<P>
   And we were reminded of something the late right fielder Robert
Clemente used to tell the press, when he was in the mood to talk to
the media at all: ``You guys never give me credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-nine years have passed since Clemente batted .314, drove
in 94 runs and finished eighth in the league MVP balloting. We'd
like to think we've come a long way from those days. After all,
didn't we vote Sosa the league MVP over McGwire last year?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's no longer true, what another Latin _ Orlando Cepeda _
said in the '60s, that ``Latin players have to do twice as much as
the American players to earn respect.''
</P>
<P>
   But it sure doesn't look like progress when MLB commissioner Bud
Selig can't find a way to get to Cincinnati himself or at least
send someone in his stead to put an imperial seal on Sosa's
impending accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Selig followed McGwire the last couple of steps in his Maris
pilgrimage, but was disguised as an empty seat in Chicago when Sosa
hit No.62 (Selig did phone the right fielder from his home in
Milwaukee 90 miles away).
</P>
<P>
   Selig filed away his absence then by saying the first man on he
moon is the one who gets the ticker-tape parade. Fine. Just the
same, we remember it being a pretty big deal when Alan Shepard hit
that golf ball on the moon after earlier becoming the second man in
space.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the worst thing we're guilty of is nationalism. It could
be the U.S. public is rooting for the long ball the same we do the
long jump. As it is with Olympians, perhaps it is for all the
athletes: As long as they're related to us by country, we'll
embrace history-makers as warmly as we would a distant cousin at a
family reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa long ago adopted the U.S. The least we can do is return the
gesture.

REDS CARRY A QUIET SWAGGER
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the road, the most popular player on the team
spends Sunday mornings in search of a Roman Catholic church. The
dazzling second baseman is a better shortstop and is named Pokey.
The bullpen is unknown and unbelievable. The manager is 68 years
old and the general manager is 38. The team plays games in a park
that is almost always half empty in a city that is ignoring a
frenetic pennant chase.
</P>
<P>
   The team is the Cincinnati Reds, who might be more of a threat
to the Mets' postseason aspirations than the Atlanta Braves are.
While the Mets have been pursuing the Braves in the National League
East and are one game out of first place, the Reds have been
futilely chasing the Houston Astros in the NL Central and have kept
a wary eye on the Mets in the wild-card tussle.
</P>
<P>
   Jack McKeon, the relaxed manager who can secure senior citizen
discounts, tells the Reds there is no pressure on them because they
were not even supposed to be in contention. McKeon was in his
office at Cinergy Field by 10:30 a.m. for Thursday night's game
against the Chicago Cubs and had the television on, a newspaper in
his hands and a cigar dangling from his mouth. He sounded calm and
confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a gut feeling that we're either going to win our
division or we're going to beat out the Mets for the wild card,''
McKeon said. ``It's a gut feeling. I've had that feeling for the
last month.''
</P>
<P>
   When McKeon was asked what made him feel so strongly about the
Reds' being able to overtake the Astros or the Mets, he did not
cite favorable schedules or glaring statistics. The manager simply
said he has a feeling. He said it would be unfair for the Braves,
Astros, Mets or Reds to insist they were better than the other
teams.
</P>
<P>
   But McKeon, whose team trails Houston by 3 1-2 games and the
Mets by three games repeated his strong sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston is going to be tough, but we play them twice at the
end of the month, so we could sneak by them,'' McKeon said. ``If
that doesn't happen, I think Atlanta will take care of the Mets and
we'll slip by them and get the wild card. That's how I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds won 11 of 13 games before Thursday night's loss to the
Cubs, but in that time they lost a half game in the standings to
Houston because the Astros won 12 of 13 in the same period.
Houston's blitz is one reason the Reds see the Mets as the team
they might be closing in on soon. The Mets have to play the Braves
six more times, while the Reds have only two more games with teams
over the .500 mark, against Houston on Sept. 28-29.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we're going to make the playoffs,'' said Sean Casey,
the player who finds a church almost every Sunday. ``It's a special
team. We feel like we're going to win every night.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unfortunate that the city of Cincinnati has not really
embraced the Reds, a $33 million creation of Jim Bowden, the young
general manager, and a team that has been patiently nurtured by
McKeon. The Reds are averaging 24,146 fans a game, which is 11th in
the league, and Casey lamented how thousands have bolted from
Cinergy on nights when Cincinnati later rallied to win.
</P>
<P>
   When Sammy Sosa batted with a runner on first and the Reds
leading, 5-3, in the ninth inning on Wednesday, fans chanted
``Sam-my, Sam-my'' in anticipation of his 60th homer, a milestone
never before achieved in two seasons. Danny Graves, who surrendered
a run-scoring single to Sosa before saving a 5-4 victory, was
incensed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to win a pennant race, not get Sammy Sosa in the
record book,'' Graves told The Cincinnati Post. ``Who are they
rooting for, Sammy or us?''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds should be easy to root for because they are underdogs
and they have exciting young players. Casey is hitting .338 and has
one of the sweetest swings in baseball. Pokey Reese, who McKeon
says could win a Gold Glove at three infield positions, will
eventually replace 10-time All-Star Barry Larkin at shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Boone was demoted to Triple-A Indianapolis in May, but the
third baseman has rebounded with 14 homers and 70 runs batted in
while hitting .293. Mike Cameron has given the Reds the sort of
defense in center field that they have lacked for several years.
Scott Williamson, a rookie who is 11-6 with 18 saves and a 1.87
earned run average, combines with Graves (8-6, 24 saves, 3.03 ERA)
to spearhead a bullpen that leads the majors with 31 victories and
a 3.24 ERA and has 49 saves.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden acquired Greg Vaughn for Reggie Sanders from San Diego
before the season, and Vaughn, a left fielder, is close to becoming
the first Reds player to slug 40 homers since George Foster in
1978.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear that the Reds needed another starter to complement
Pete Harnisch (14-9) and Steve Parris (9-2), so Bowden gambled in
obtaining Juan Guzman from the Baltimore Orioles. Guzman, 35, has
revived his career while going 6-2. Larkin is no longer the only
Red worth watching as Guzman is another integral piece to this
surprising team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exciting because no one expected us to do anything,''
Casey said. ``We believe in ourselves.''

BIG INTERNET SITES JOINING AUCTION NETWORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 100 Internet sites, including three of the biggest _
Microsoft's MSN, Excite(AT)Home and Lycos _ have agreed to share
their auction listings so that an item put up for sale on one site
will be available for bidding on all other sites.
</P>
<P>
   The move, which is to be announced Friday, is an effort to catch
up with the huge popularity of Ebay, the dominant online auction
site, which has more than 3 million items for sale at any one time,
ranging from stuffed bears to minivans.
</P>
<P>
   The new auction network was established by Fairmarket, a small
company in Woburn, Mass. Fairmarket initially created a service
that let companies set up their own auctions, mainly as a way to
sell discontinued items and products that have been returned. Its
clients include CompUSA, New Line Cinema and CBS Sportsline's
sporting-goods shop.
</P>
<P>
   These companies had used the site to sell their own merchandise,
but they have now agreed to have all their products listed on
general-purpose auction sites as well.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, the largest Internet service, does not run its
own auctions. Ebay agreed to pay $75 million over four years to
promote its auctions to America Online users.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo, the second-biggest Internet service, has competed
aggressively with Ebay by offering free auctions. Ebay charges a
fee to list an item and then collects a percentage of the purchase
price. Since Ebay experienced a series of computer blackouts in
recent months, Yahoo's popularity has surged. It now lists 700,000
items.
</P>
<P>
   But the other popular Internet services have found it very
difficult to make headway into Ebay's turf. Excite(AT)Home, for
example, has fewer than 20,000 items for sale on its free auction
site _ a major incentive in its decision to merge those listings
into the new broader network.
</P>
<P>
   ``In auctions, scale is really valuable,'' said David Tse, a
senior vice president at Excite. ``If you put an item up for sale,
you want the most potential bidders. If you are a buyer, you want
to see the most products in the category you are interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   The move represents the first entry into auctions by Microsoft,
which has been rushing to make sure that its MSN Internet service
matches all the features offered by competitors.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Microsoft has introduced an instant message
software to match one of the most popular features of America
Online, and a name-your-own-price travel service, modeled after the
well-known offering of Priceline.com.
</P>
<P>
   While it is unclear how successful Microsoft will be in any of
these areas, its entry into any market inevitably causes investors
to raise concerns about the leaders of that market. In the first
two days after Microsoft's travel service was announced, for
example, Priceline's stock dropped nearly 20 percent. Ebay, which
has a stock market value of $19 billion, did not respond to
requests for comment on the new auction network.
</P>
<P>
   The third-biggest auction site is Amazon.com, the biggest online
retailer. Though the company declines to say how many items it has
for sale, Auctionwatch, a site that tracks auctions, estimates that
Amazon lists between 100,000 and 200,000 items.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Lycos was the first big site to use the Fairmarket
auction system, letting its users post items for sale and bid on
items from all participating auctions. While Lycos had considered
starting its own auctions or selling links to Ebay, as America
Online has done, it decided that it ``would take a long time to
build, and going with a joint venture would give us more
traction,'' said Jeffrey Bennett, the director of business
development at Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Fairmarket has also signed up Ticketmaster-Citysearch, which
runs local auctions; Boston.com, a unit of The New York Times Co.,
and Earthlink, the big Internet service provider. In all, these
sites will contribute about 70,000 listings from the start to the
Fairmarket network.
</P>
<P>
   Each member site will present the auctions in its own format and
graphic design, so that shoppers will not know that the listings
come from multiple sites. And each site will integrate the auctions
with its other services. For example, Lycos users can have the
auctions they are bidding on presented on their ``My Lycos'' start
page alongside their chosen stock quotes and sports scores.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Lycos and Excite plan to offer auctions without any
fees. Microsoft will not charge a listing fee but will impose a
transaction fee of between 1.5 and to 5 percent, depending on the
purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   Deanna Sanford, the lead product manager for MSN, said that
Microsoft would be charging a transaction fee, even though others
were not, because it expected such fees would become standard.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for Fairmarket to profit from the system, sellers must
eventually charge such fees. Fairmarket is charging the sites about
1 percent of completed auctions. In addition, the site whose user
buys an item also receives 1 percent of the purchase price from the
site that posted the auction. But Fairmarket said it was waiving
these fees for sites that offer free auctions.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett of Lycos said that even if competition prevented the
company from imposing transaction fees, it could still profit by
selling advertising on the auction pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the business of aggregating an audience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said it was not clear how much the Fairmarket venture
could dent Ebay's market dominance. ``For MSN and the others, it's
a better starting point than if they did this on their own,'' said
Fiona Swerdlow, an analyst with Jupiter Communications. ``But Ebay
is clearly out in front.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bennett said that Lycos could still build a big business as
newcomers come onto the Web with no loyalty to Ebay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hats off to Ebay, which has really benefited from its
first-mover advantage,'' he said. ``But the game is early, and
there are a lot more folks to come in and be attracted to the
auction space.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: MALAYSIA JAILS A JOURNALIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Sept. 16:
</P>
<P>
   Murray Hiebert, a Canadian journalist for The Far Eastern
Economic Review, an English-language weekly magazine, has begun
serving a six-week jail term in Malaysia for the crime of
``scandalizing the court.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Hiebert ruling and others, judges have handed out prison
terms to various people who have alleged that Malaysian justice is
less than pristine _ thus unwittingly confirming the critics'
charges. These rulings are not only an affront to free speech but
an indication of a growing contempt in Malaysia for the rule of
law.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1988, Malaysia's courts were respected worldwide. Then
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad purged a number of senior judges.
The trial earlier this year of former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar
Ibrahim, who had slipped from Mahathir's favor, is the most visible
example of how far the judiciary has sunk. Anwar received a
six-year sentence for corruption after proceedings that exhibited
almost daily proof of the system's bias.
</P>
<P>
   The disgraceful Hiebert ruling continues the trend. Hiebert
wrote about a lawsuit by the wife of a prominent judge. She sued
her son's school, alleging that it had unfairly dropped him from
the debate team. The article noted the unusually rapid progress of
the case through the judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   Others sentenced to prison for similar offenses include a lawyer
for Anwar who suggested that prosecutors in the case may have
fabricated evidence, and an opposition parliamentarian who
criticized court treatment of a girl who said she had been raped by
a high government official. Even a United Nations special
rapporteur investigating corruption in Malaysia's judiciary _ an
official with legal immunity _ is being sued by Malaysian companies
with ties to the government. His alleged defamation was his
description of complaints that powerful businessmen can manipulate
justice.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Attorney General Mohtar Abdullah made the Orwellian
announcement that anyone who accused him of carrying out selective
prosecutions could be prosecuted for criminal defamation. It is a
sign that it is not just the judges who are eager to use a
once-admired legal system to jail their critics.  &QL;

WORLD CUP SUCCESS LIFTS UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the University of North Carolina is any barometer, as it has
always been, women's soccer at the college level is starting to
feel the benefits of the triumph by the U.S, national team in the
Women's World Cup this past summer. While the women's game has
become more competitive in recent years with Notre Dame and Florida
winning national titles and ending the dynasty at North Carolina,
attendance at women's games so far this season has shown a huge
increase.
</P>
<P>
   As the dominant team with 15 national titles, North Carolina's
average attendance of 3,046 last year was the largest in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds of this size used to be reserved for games of paramount
importance or for heated rivalries. But in the Tar Heels' first
game of the season at home Sept. 1 against Tennessee, a rather weak
team with no soccer history, the size of the crowd surprised even
Anson Dorrance, the North Carolina coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe my eyes,'' Dorrance said from his office in
Chapel Hill, N.C., about the crowd of 4,655 for a midweek match to
watch the Tar Heels' easy 3-0 victory over the Lady Vols. ``I was
skeptical about the overflow of the World Cup. I was wondering if
the World Cup would have an impact. Maybe I underestimated the
impact the World Cup would have on the women's game in just about
every level.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The American success in the Women's World Cup has given
additional incentives for colleges and universities to pour money
into women's programs.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking balance in collegiate sports programs, it appears that
women's soccer may benefit the most in the battle for gender
equity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some schools are dying to find the Title IX equivalent to
football and they have found it with women's soccer,'' Dorrance
said. ``The thing we have to do is become a revenue-producing sport
to have a real impact on NCAA decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Men's soccer programs found out the hard way in August how much
emphasis the National Collegiate Athletic Association puts on
revenues, and expenses for its major tournament. The NCAA reversed
an earlier decision to increase the number of teams for the men's
Division I tournament from 32 to to 48, and stuck with 32. The
reason was strictly financial, said Tom Jacobs, the NCAA
administrator in charge of men's soccer. The size of the women's
tournament, however, has been increased to 48 teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a shock to most of us,'' coach Jerry Yeagley of Indiana
University, the defending champion, said of the NCAA's refusal to
expand the tournament to match the size of the women's event. ``We
thought the decision had been made to go to 48. We thought it was a
rubber-stamping thing, but it stonewalled.''
</P>
<P>
   Women's programs have been given priority over the men for the
last few years.
</P>
<P>
   While the number of Division I men's programs has remained about
the same for almost a decade, the number of women's programs in
Division I has increased steadily. There will be about 260, while
the men have fluctuated between 190 and 200 for most of the past
decade, with 196 expected for this year.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's victory in the national title game last year after
only four seasons with a women's program has encouraged schools
such as Texas, Penn State, Notre Dame and Nebraska, to name a few,
to invest in women's soccer. Texas lured away Notre Dame coach
Chris Petrucelli this season.
</P>
<P>
   Petrucelli enjoyed support at Notre Dame, which hired Randy
Waldrum of Baylor to replace him, but Texas apparently made a
lucrative offer. Petrucelli said it was also difficult to look away
from Texas' commitment to invest $28 million in a soccer facility.
</P>
<P>
   The other side of the pretty picture is that coaches in women's
programs are now under pressure to produce on the field after their
schools committed more resources to the programs. As a result,
there has been a large turnover in jobs, with almost one in five
schools with Division I women's programs changing coaches for this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Petrucelli views Santa Clara, Portland, Notre Dame and Penn
State as the toughest challengers to North Carolina and Florida for
the national title this season. ``They're a lot of teams on the
verge of becoming really good and I look for a lot of upsets this
season,'' Petrucelli said.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State registered perhaps the biggest upset thus far,
shocking North Carolina last Sunday with a 3-2 triumph, which came
only two days after the Lady Lions had lost to Duke in the
Nike/Carolina Classic at Chapel Hill, before a crowd of 4,213.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four of the 48 teams will receive automatic bids for the
women's tournament, which will end the first weekend in December at
San Diego State with the newly named Women's College Cup. Clemson,
Nebraska, Duke, Wisconsin, Texas A&AMP;M and Hartford could also
challenge for the title. It may take more than a year or two for
Petrucelli to lift Texas into contention.
</P>
<P>
   The men's tournament will award automatic bids to 16 of the 32
teams, and the champion will be crowned a week after the women in
Charlotte, N.C. The NCAA has upgraded the men's Final Four by
moving the event to Charlotte, after four years in Richmond, where
the facility is half the size of Ericsson Stadium, the home of the
Carolina Panthers of the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana is the favorite to repeat, the way it did in 1982-83.
The Hoosiers have lost one key player from last year's team, Dema
Kovalenko, now in Major League Soccer with the Chicago Fire. Their
strongest challenge is expected to come from UCLA and Maryland, two
schools with several youth national team players on their rosters.
Creighton, Clemson, St. Louis, Stanford, Santa Clara, Virginia, St.
John's, Connecticut, Duke, California State-Fullerton and
Washington could also contend for the Men's College Cup. &QL;

$1 BILLION GOES TO MINORITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH SCHUBERT and KRISTIN DIZON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Rick Williams remembers how his grandmother would save
buffalo nickels from the $50 a month his family lived on. They were
for his college education, she would say.
</P>
<P>
   That was long before Williams, a member of the Oglala Sioux
Tribe in Nebraska, became the executive director of the American
Indian College Fund _ a fund that doubled in size Thursday when the
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced a $1 billion
scholarship program to help high-achieving minority students
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sitting Bull once said, `Let us put our minds together and see
what kind of future we can bring for our children,''' Williams said
at Thursday's press conference to announce the Gates Millennium
Scholarship program. ``That's what we're doing here today.''
</P>
<P>
   The $1 billion scholarship, to be administered by the United
Negro College Fund, in collaboration with the American Indian
College Fund and Hispanic Scholarship Fund, creates a reservoir of
money on a scale the organizations have never seen.
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic Scholarship Fund will be able to award at least
twice the number of scholarships it awarded this year, and the
United Negro College Fund's revenues for the year jumped by nearly
one-third.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is truly a historic day, this is a wonderful moment,''
said William H. Gray, III, president of the UNCF.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many young people don't get an opportunity in the minority
community to reach their potential and to go to college because of
the barrier of finance,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Gates Millennium Scholars Program'' will provide $50
million a year for 20 years primarily to black, Hispanic and
American Indian students, although the program will be open to
other minority students as well. The first scholarships will be
awarded in the fall of 2000, based primarily on academic
achievement and financial need.
</P>
<P>
   The scholarship is designed to support what will be about 20,000
minority students as they move through their undergraduate degrees
and onto graduate schools in math, science, engineering, education
or library science.
</P>
<P>
   The number of minorities who earn doctoral degrees in these
fields is extremely low. In 1996, only one Native American earned a
Ph.D. in mathematics, according to the National Center for
Education Statistics. Only 1 percent of all engineering doctorates
went to blacks that year and Hispanics earned 3 percent of
education Ph.D.s.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are talking about a program that will double and triple
those numbers over the next two decades, and that means changing
the landscape of American education, but also the landscape of
America itself,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   The scholarships will provide financial assistance to about
1,000 new students a year, with an annual investment of $50
million. In any given year, a total of 4,000 students could be
working their way toward a degree as Millennium Scholars.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for assistance, students must have a 3.3 high school
grade-point average, be nominated by a teacher or the school's
principal and must also write an essay. Awards will be renewed
annually and participants will be expected to maintain a cumulative
G.P.A. of 3.0 or better.
</P>
<P>
   The grants _ which cover tuition, room and board and expenses _
will be large enough so that students will not have to work or take
out loans. The idea is to give minority students from impoverished
backgrounds the chance to go onto college without the burdens of
debt or work commitments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest thing you can do is provide somebody with a
wonderful education,'' Gates said Thursday. ``And we'd like to do
that in a way that they can really focus on their studies, that
they don't have to be having too many jobs on the side or be
thinking about the size of the loans that they're building up.''
</P>
<P>
   Before a word was uttered by Foundation co-chair Patty
Stonesifer, the audience of politicians, educators and foundation
employees at Thursday's press conference gave a standing ovation to
the Gateses. The announcement was made at the new headquarters of
the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, a crisp, modern two story
building east side of Lake Union, just north of downtown Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   As news of the program spread, even President Clinton took time
out to recognize the substantial initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I applaud the foundation for its leadership and foresight,''
Clinton said in a statement. ``These landmark scholarships will
help address important needs.''
</P>
<P>
   During the press conference, Bill Gates called the close of the
millennium a period of ``breathtaking'' advances in technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if we look inside that picture and say, `is everybody
getting a chance to benefit from this,' the answer's really no,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling her own upbringing and the couple's approach in
raising their own two young children, Melinda Gates spoke of
helping youngsters to see opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``And yet when we look out today, there are many students,
including many minority students, who don't have that horizon,''
she said. ``Their parents aren't telling them, `You can go to
college. You can go to any college you can get into.' Because their
parents literally can't afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   Education is primary focus of the philanthropic Gates
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Gates dropped out of Harvard to found Microsoft with high-school
friend Paul Allen, a move that ultimately made him the world's
richest man. Microsoft is the world's largest producer of computer
software, and has helped Gates reach a net worth of more than $90
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Melinda Gates is a graduate and trustee of Duke University.
</P>
<P>
   The Gateses' enormous gift comes less than a year after
Washington voters approved Initiative 200, banning
government-backed affirmative action programs and removing race
from university admissions decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the press conference were quick to say that
these scholarships have nothing to do with college admissions, but
give financial support to qualified high school graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gary Locke, however, said the Gateses gift can help fill
the vacuum of opportunity in the wake of I-200's ban on affirmative
action programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advocates of Initiative 200 said government can't do it;
they never said that the private sector can't do it,'' said Locke,
the nation's first Chinese American governor and the son of
working-class immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   William H. Gates Jr., the Microsoft chairman's father and a
co-chair of the Gates Foundation, said that I-200 had little effect
on the shape of the scholarship initiative, which had been in the
works for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Gates Millennium Scholarship Program sends an
encouraging message to potential minority students, ``it's a real
plus,'' said Gates, who is also a UW Regent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Thursday's enthusiasm for the Gateses' benevolence,
however, some in the minority community believe that the chairman
of Microsoft is in a position to do much more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad that he gave the money, and I'm glad that it's
earmarked for minority education,'' said Robert Jackson, a Quinalt
Indian who served on an advisory committee on minority issues at
the University of California Riverside. ``But I would also like to
see training programs and taxation of the software industry to
benefit minorities as well.''

COUNSELORS, PSYCHOLOGISTS OFFER STUDENTS HOPE, ASSURANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARY DOCLAR 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Some drew pictures and wrote cards. Others
cried and needed comfort. Most simply wanted to vent about the
brutal crime that had shaken their world.
</P>
<P>
   For counselors, psychologists and other mental health
professionals who fanned out across Fort Worth on Thursday to
encounter those emotions and help those touched by Wednesday's mass
shooting at Wedgwood Baptist Church, the mission was difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children are frightened,'' said Ann Baker, a psychologist
with the Fort Worth school district. ``For many of them, this is
their first encounter with death, and it's very sobering for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Many agencies offered psychological services, including the Fort
Worth and White Settlement school districts and a nonprofit
alternative school where one
</P>
<P>
   shooting victim attended classes. Southwestern Baptist
Theological Seminary, where several victims were current or former
students, also provided services.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth schools used campus counselors and 25 school
psychologists to help students cope with their grief, said Dr.
Michael Dixon, director of psychological services. Several other
school districts, including Birdville and Northwest, also offered
their help, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real concern kids were expressing was that this happened
in a sanctuary,'' Dixon said. ``This was such a violation of their
sense of propriety. This is a sacred place.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker, who provided counseling at the church Wednesday night and
went to three schools near the church Thursday, said she tried to
comfort children without promising them that such a tragedy would
never happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to get them to recognize that these things happen;
people get hurt and the way you get through it is by holding hands
with others,'' she said. `` ``You try not to say to them it's never
going to happen because it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the elementary children drew pictures as a means of
coping and middle-school students wrote letters, Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Deryl Logan, another Fort Worth school district psychologist,
said the most difficult question was the one he couldn't answer:
Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a good number of students that are still in
the shock phase,'' he said. ``A lot of them, it's already hit them
emotionally and they're very upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is asking `Why, why, why?' and there's never a good
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the students he met with didn't witness the shooting,
some voiced fears about future violence, Logan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them were just apprehensive,'' he said. ``One student
that I talked with even asked me, `Why's the police here? Is
something going to happen?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Both psychologists said that students didn't show any signs of
callousness to such violence despite mass shootings becoming more
frequent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find very few kids who don't have normal human sensitivities
to these situations,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   At Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, counseling was
offered to seminary students and others affected by the shooting. A
dozen counselors were sent to public and private schools to offer
assistance, said Dr. Ian Jones, director of the seminary's
counseling center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to show how God's healing hands can work to help in
the midst of pain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cassata High School, a nonprofit alternative school that serves
about 200 students, called in eight outside counselors to help
their two counselors meet with students grieving over slain
classmate Justin Ray.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we couldn't deal with it alone,'' said Cassata
counselor Brandon Pope. &QL;
