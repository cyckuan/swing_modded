<HEADLINE> UK Unemployment at 20-year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 17 (Xinhua) - UK unemployment has fallen to its
lowest level in 20 years. But wages are continuing to rise rapidly,
although at a slightly slower rate than last month.
</P>
<P>
The latest official figures for the month of April show that
the number of people unemployed and claiming benefit tumbled by
28800 to 1112000, or 3.9 percent of the workforce.
</P>
<P>
The drop was the largest since July last year and puts Britain'
s unemployment level way below double-digit levels in many
euroland countries.
</P>
<P>
But the regional divide between North and South remains strong,
with unemployment in the Northern region nearly three times higher
than in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
Although the growth in average earnings slowed slightly from
previous months, wages are still rising rapidly and much faster
than the Bank of England would like.
</P>
<P>
The Bank has said that any increase above 4.5 percent in wages
is incompatible with its inflation target of 2.5 percent.

</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index ended down 128.8 points, or 2 percent,

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for More Efforts for Peace in N. Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I urge the parties to lift their sights, seize the
possibilities that are within their grasp, and take the steps
necessary to advance the cause of peace," Clinton said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The brief statement was issued to mark the second anniversary
of the referendum in which voters in both parts of Ireland
overwhelmingly endorsed the Good Friday Accord.
</P>
<P>
"Today we are on the threshold of a major achievement -- a
lasting political arrangement that will allow the people of
Northern Ireland and their representatives to decide their future
for themselves by exclusively peaceful means, on the basis of
consent," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Britain suspended Northern Ireland's power-sharing
administration in February after the Irish Republic Army (IRA)
refused to begin disarming.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the IRA agreed to begin disarming itself
after the British and Irish governments announced ambitious plans
to transfer power back to the province's suspended Catholic-
Protestant administration by May 22 and to extend the deadline for
total IRA disarmament from that day to June 2001.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Visits Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fred Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, told a press conference that
Ibrahim Gambari, the secretary-general's special adviser for
special assignments in Africa, arrived in Luanda Tuesday for a
week of high-level meetings.
</P>
<P>
Discussions are expected to focus on the prospects for peace,
elections intended for next year, and the role of the U.N. Office
in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Gambari met with Angolan Foreign Minister Joao Miranda Tuesday
and will meet with Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, the
spokesman said. On Saturday, Gambari is expected to travel to
Huambo, central Angola, to see first-hand the conditions of
internally displaced persons there.
</P>
<P>
Since the fighting resumed in 1998, the number of internally
displaced people has risen dramatically in Angola. The U.N. Office
for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that there are
now some 2.6 million internally displaced persons, which is 50
percent more than last year.

<HEADLINE> Castro to Attend Ibero- American Summit in Panama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Associate Coordinator of the 10th Ibero-American
Summit, Alonso Fernandez, said that "his presence (Castro's) in
Panama is confirmed."
</P>
<P>
The invitation to the Summit was delivered in person to the
King of Spain by the Foreign Minister of Panama, Jose Miguel
Aleman, two months ago, said Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
He also took into account the participation of the presidents
of Mexico, Ernesto Zedillo; Chile, Ricardo Lagos, and of Peru,
Alberto Fujimori, in a meeting of the Asia-Pacific area.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez said that Castro and the King of Spain will attract
the attention of Panamanians, who will be attentive to all their
activities.
</P>
<P>
From 1,200 to 1,400 journalists are expected to participate
covering the meeting of the leaders, he said.
</P>
<P>
In Panama, the possibility of celebrating the Summit every two
years instead of every year, will be studied.
</P>
<P>
The 11th Summit will take place in Peru, while the 12th in
Dominican Republic. "We finish there, and start all over again,"
said Fernandez.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Plunge on Profit-Taking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks plunged
Wednesday on profit-taking from four days of strong rally.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 164.83 at 10,769.
74.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index fell 72.61 at 3,644.96 and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index fell 18.24 at 1,447.80.
</P>
<P>
Stocks fell as investors took profits to look in gains from a
strong rally in the previous four sessions. The Dow index was up 5.
5 percent while the Nasdaq composite rose 9.8 percent in that
period.
</P>
<P>
Investors defied a half percentage point increase in the funds
rate Tuesday, driving the stock market surprisingly higher. The
rate hike marked the sixth time since last June when the Federal
Reserve started the long run of rate increase.
</P>
<P>
Higher rates are generally bad for stocks, raising borrowing
costs and cutting into bottom-line profits.
</P>
<P>
The market has suffered from the rising rates in the past 11
months. The industrials now are 8.1 percent short of their record
set on January 14 and the Nasdaq composite is 27.8 percent below
its March 10 peak.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 7.85 at 650.98 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 5.51 at 935.09 today. The Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies fell 6.32 at 499.66.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly a 2-to-1
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,908 down, 1,015 up
and 483 unchanged.

NYSE volume declined to 813.68 million shares from 945.94
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for Universal Participation in Multilateral Treaty Framework During Millennium Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Wednesday sent a letter to all heads of state and government
to "use the unique opportunity presented by the forthcoming
Millennium Summit to rededicate themselves to the international
legal framework and actively contribute to the strengthening of
the international rule of law," a U.N. press release announced
here.
</P>
<P>
"In particular, he has encouraged those States which are not
already party to the vast body of treaties deposited with him to
sign and ratify them," the news release said.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day Summit, scheduled to begin on September 6
at the U.N. Headquarters in New York, a large number of world
leaders are expected to participate in round-table discussions
focusing on strengthening the role of the United Nations in
meeting the challenges of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The challenges include expanding and enhancing the rule of law
in international relations. A comprehensive network of
international treaties deposited with the U.N. secretary-general
affects a wide scope of human activity and has been the foundation
of much of the political, social and economic progress achieved
since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Annan has identified 25 core treaties, which
reflect the key policy goals of the United Nations, to be the
focus of a sustained effort to encourage signature and
ratification during the Millennium Summit, said the press release.
</P>
<P>
Included among them are a range of human rights conventions, as
well as treaties on refugees and stateless persons, international
criminal matters, disarmament and the environment. Some of these
instruments have been opened for signature for years, but have not
been successful in attracting universal participation.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Annan also requested every Member State to carry
out a general review of all multilateral treaties deposited with
him. He invited them to assess the participation by their
countries in this vast legal framework developed by the
international community under the umbrella of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In that connection, Annan has also sent heads of State and
government a full list of more than 500 conventions that are
deposited with him. Governments are requested to respond by August
1 of their intention to sign, ratify or accede to any of the
instruments on both lists during the Millennium Summit, the press
release said.
</P>
<P>
For these States who have not been able to ratify these
treaties due to a lack of resources, the Secretary-General has
requested all United Nations agencies to provide appropriate
technical assistance. The objective is to help States to become
parties to these treaties and to implement them at the national
level.

BUENOS AIRES, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Managing Director of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) Korst Kohler left here Wednesday
after his visit to Argentina.
</P>
<P>
Kohler said that Argentina is right in calling for the

Argentina's business sector.
</P>
<P>
The IMF chief met Wednesday morning in a business breakfast
with Argentine entrepreneurs from different sectors to discuss
important issues.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Argentine businessmen told him of their
preoccupation on the wish of many countries to export, but not to
accept imports, within the framework of globalization.
</P>
<P>
Kohler arrived here Tuesday from Brazil, and now is on his way
to Central America and Mexico.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Greece Decides to Continue Closer Ties With Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 ATHENS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Greece Wednesday decided to
continue its efforts for a closer ties with neighboring Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made during the talks between Greek Prime
Minister Costas Simitis, Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos and
Foreign Minister George Papandreou on confidence-building measures
with Turkey and developments in the relations between the two
neighboring countries, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
ANA quoted diplomatic sources as saying that it was agreed
during the meeting that Athens would continue to work towards
strengthening the policy of "no tension" with Turkey and the need
to promote the 1988 memorandum signed by the then foreign
ministers of the two countries, namely Greece's Karolos Papoulias
and Turkey's Mesut Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
The premier and the two ministers also approved a proposal for
the creation of a joint committee of the foreign and defense
ministries, the holding of ad hoc meetings between the two
ministries with the purpose of better coordination on issues
concerning the duties of both ministries and the processing of
Greek proposals for confidence-building measures, as well as the
study of corresponding Turkish ones.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been at odds for
decades over their disputes in the territorial waters, air space
limits and the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean,
and the Cyprus problem, but the two long-time rivals have since
last June begun to better their strained relations with the
holding of several rounds of low-level talks and the signing of a
number of bilateral cooperation pacts.

<HEADLINE> Former U.S. Pentagon officials Call for Delay of NMD Deployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Three former U.S. Defense
Department officials have called on the Clinton administration to
delay deployment of the National Missile Defense (NMD) system to
shield the Untied States against long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
John Deutch and John White, both deputy defense secretaries
under President Bill Clinton, and Harold Brown, Jimmy Carter's
defense secretary, said the NMD was "not mature enough to make a
confident deployment decision this year." They made their argument
in the summer issue of the journal Foreign Policy.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the three proposed steps toward placing ships with
advanced interceptor missiles of the Theater Missile Defense (TMD)
system off the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), Iran
or other countries.
</P>
<P>
The TMD would be cheaper and easier to make work than the NMD,
they said, in addition to curbing the diplomatic backlash.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to decide this year whether to break ground
next spring to start building a powerful radar station in Alaska
in the first phase of an NMD shield to be operational by 2005.
</P>
<P>
The international community has opposed the NMD, which would
either breach or require major changes to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty between the United States and the then Soviet Union,
a cornerstone of arms control.
</P>
<P>
Arms control experts said the U.S. plan to set up the NMD and
TMD systems runs against the trend of the times and will have a
major adverse impact on global and regional strategic balances and
stability.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on Ethiopia, Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The meeting came after days of hard work by experts from
Council members to fine tune the draft resolution.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Council, prompted by the renewed border fighting
in the Horn of Africa, adopted a resolution late Friday last week,
demanding Ethiopia and Eritrea immediately stop their conflict and
threatened unspecified action if fighting continued on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between the two neighboring countries over border
claims and economic policy exploded into war in May 1998 and tens
of thousands have been killed in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea both insist they want a peaceful
settlement but each blames the other for a series of failed peace
initiatives since the outbreak of the war two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The fighting erupted a week after the failure of peace talks in
Algiers under the auspices of the Organization of African Unity
and two days after a delegation from the Security Council visited
Addis Ababa and Asmara to appeal for the resumption f negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Russia Defends Hosting Yugoslav Defense Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Wednesday refuted the
United States' dissatisfaction over its hosting of Yugoslav
Defense Minister Dragoljub Ojdanic earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Moscow does not recognize the decision of the International
Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia which has blamed some
Yugoslav statesmen for committing war crimes, the Interfax news
agency quoted Russian military-diplomatic sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Their remarks were apparently a response to Washington's
displeasure with Dragoljub Ojdanic's visit to Moscow. Richard
Boucher,the U.S. State Department spokesman, told a news briefing
that Washington will "raise this on an urgent basis."
</P>
<P>
The Moscow Times reported Wednesday that Ojdanic arrived in
Moscow on May 7, the day Russian President Vladimir Putin was
inaugurated and left unhindered five days later after meeting top
Russian defense officials and taking in the Victory Day parade.
</P>
<P>
"Yugoslavia is a sovereign state and Russia has the right to
develop relations with it, including in the military sphere,"
Interfax quoted the military-diplomatic sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the sources insisted that "Russia fulfills all of its
commitments stipulated in the U.N. Security Council resolution on
Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, the Russian Foreign Ministry described
as"politically motivated" the decision by prosecutor of the
International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia to sign an
indictment on five top political and military leaders of
Yugoslavia,including the Yugoslav and Serb presidents.

Horacio Chighizola said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, the official said that the main
goals of this mission are to increase trade relations with China
and to consolidate the foundations of business contacts.
</P>
<P>
Chighizola expressed his wish that as a consequence of the
visit to China, bilateral trade will reach a new level, in value,
but also in sectors.
</P>
<P>
The Vice Foreign Minister of Argentina underscored the
importance of the signing of the bilateral accord on last March,
for it contributes to the process of China's access to the World
Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>

He said that such agreement will strengthen even more the close
political, economic, and trade links between both countries.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Mandelson: No Secret Deals on N.Irish Assembly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary
Peter Mandelson Wednesday denied that there was a secret deal
between British and Irish governments over any future suspension
of the power-sharing assembly in the province.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson, speaking in the House of Commons, said Dublin would
not have a veto over suspending the assembly if the secretary of
state felt such a move was necessary in the future.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson said Northern Ireland now had two opportunities -the
prospect of a return to devolved government and "real and lasting
progress on the removal of arms".
</P>
<P>
He was answering questions from MPs after holding talks with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair at Downing Street as efforts
continue to return a power-sharing government to Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's pro-British Ulster Unionist Party leader
David Trimble said on Wednesday that he still had to decide
whether his party would return to a devolved government.
</P>
<P>
He said he was taking a "wait and see" approach and insisted
that he and his party would not be rushed into a decision.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the Ulster Unionist's 860-member ruling council is
expected to meet to decide if it will rejoin a government with
republicans on May 22, the date by which Blair hopes to have the
political institutions restored.
</P>
<P>
They were suspended in February because of an impasse over
paramilitary arms decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
Following Wednesday's meeting, a Downing Street spokesman said
a number of "difficult issues" still had to be resolved but
dialogue with the parties was continuing.

LIMA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of businessmen from Peru
will travel to China in the near future, said on Wednesday the
chief executive officer of the Commission for Export Promotions (
Prompex), Antonio Castillo.
</P>
<P>
"The decision to visit China is important, for Peru must
consolidate its presence in this important Asian market," said the
official.
</P>
<P>
Castillo said that fish meal is among the most important
exports the group of businessmen will promote in the Asian giant,
considered to be among the main world powers in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The representative of Prompex said that during their visit to
China, the businessmen delegation from Peru, will establish
contacts with Chinese entrepreneurs interested in acquiring
Peruvian products.
</P>
<P>
Peru exports to China copper, iron, lead, molybdenum and many
other sea products.
</P>
<P>
In the last ten years, trade between Peru and China increased
from 70.664 million dollars in 1990, to over 416.959 million
dollars in 1999.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Welcomes Arrest of Sierra Leone's Rebel Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Wednesday welcomed the arrest of Sierra Leone's
rebel leader Foday Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
"Today we had some good news that Foday Sankoh has in fact been
captured," Albright told a Congressional panel.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Sankoh was arrested late Tuesday in the
capital Freetown. He was first taken to the compound of former
military ruler Johnny Paul Koroma and then transferred to
Cockerill Barracks.
</P>
<P>
With criticism worldwide of U.S. reluctance to take action
against the rebels' taking hostages of U.N. peacekeepers, Albright
made some complaints before the panel that it was Congress that
was obstructing attempts to restore order in Sierra Leone. She
said the Clinton administration would invite "both congressional
and public support for doing our job in Sierra Leone."
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, a State Department said that U.S.
presidential envoy Jesse Jackson would leave late Wednesday on a
peace mission to West Africa.
</P>
<P>
"His mission is ...to reinforce U.S. support for their
initiatives to help the United Nations secure the release of the U.
N. hostages and resolve the crisis in Sierra Leone," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Jackson, once in West Africa, will consult
regional government on the crisis in Sierra Leone.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton,
House Speaker Dennis Hastert and Republican presumptive
presidential candidate George W. Bush made speeches on different
occasions Wednesday, urging Congress to approve permanent normal
trade relations (PNTR) with China.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, speaking to the graduating class of the U.S. Coast
Guard Academy in Connecticut, warned Congress that rejecting PNTR
with China would invite "a future of dangerous confrontation and
constant insecurity."
</P>
<P>
"I believe a 'no' vote invites a future of dangerous
confrontation and constant insecurity," he said.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Hastert, talking to reporters at the House
triangle, said granting PNTR to China is good for both American
and Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"It is a top priority of U.S. Congress," Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China, now the 4th largest trade partner of the
United States, will become the world's largest market which U.S.
farmers and products will benefit from after its accession to the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Granting PNTR status to China will make it easier for the U.S.
to export its commodities overseas, said Hastert, who appeared
with some representatives of farmers from his home state of
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, Texas governor George W. Bush also urged
Congress to extend PNTR status to China to boost U.S. sales
overseas.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to an audience of several hundred at a Boeing Co.
airplane factory in Washington State, Bush said political
differences should not prevent the House from voting in favor of
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
"For businesses and workers and farmers across our country, it
will mean much lower trade barriers, important opportunities for U.
S. exports and more work and jobs for United States workers," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Albright Says Congressmen Play with Fire on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Some in Congress are threatening to force the premature
withdrawal of U.S. troops from Kosovo. This is playing with fire.
In the Balkans, signs of impatience can be misinterpreted as
symptoms of weakness," Albright said at a meeting of "the campaign
to preserve U.S. leadership."
</P>
<P>
A legislation debated in the Senate this week requires the next
U.S. president to begin withdrawing U.S. troops from Kosovo by
July 2001 unless Congress votes to extend the deployment.
</P>
<P>
Albright added that such a measure will prevent the United
States from achieving its goal in Southeast Europe.
</P>
<P>
"We will not achieve our goals in Southeast Europe if our eyes
are always on the clock and our focus is solely on what others do.
We are more than bookkeepers and spectators; we are leaders," she
added.
</P>
<P>
"And our fundamental objective in Southeast Europe is not to
leave; it's to win. Our job with our partners is to prevent
further violence and help democratic principles take root," she
noted.
</P>
<P>
She predicted that if the United States starts to leave the
region now, it will have to return to the Balkans "again and again.
"
</P>
<P>
"If we persist and succeed, we'll take a giant step towards a
Europe whole and free, where differences are settled peacefully
and wars just don't happen," she explained.
</P>
<P>
The United States has currently deployed some 5,900 troops in
Kosovo. They entered the region last year with peacekeepers from
other countries last summer after the NATO conducted a 78-day air
campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen stressed that
he would recommend President Bill Clinton to veto any legislation
that suggests "an artificial deadline" for the U.S. to withdraw
from Kosovo.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton disclosed
Wednesday that the United States, with the help from Jordan, had
shut down a terror network linked to Osama bin Laden that was
aimed to blast Millennium celebration sites in America.
</P>
<P>
"Last December, working with Jordan, we shut down a plot to
place large bombs at locations where Americans might gather on New
Year's Eve," Clinton said in a commencement address to the U.S.
Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
"We learned this plot was linked to terrorist camps in
Afghanistan and the organization created by Osama bin Lade, the
man responsible for the 1998 bombing of our embassies in Tanzania
and Kenya which cost the lives of Americans and hundreds of
Africans," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden is wanted by the United States for allegedly causing
explosion at the two embassies in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the allegation to bolster his argument for an
extra 300 million dollars for counter-terrorism programs.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. House OKs Kosovo Pull-out Despite Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The measure, as an amendment to a defense spending bill, passed
on a 264-153 vote despite an earlier warning by Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright that Congress was "playing with fire" by
setting withdrawal deadlines in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The measure requires the president to certify by April 1, 2001,
that NATO allies had met most of their commitments for funding
police, reconstruction and humanitarian aid activities in Kosovo,
otherwise, U.S. funds could only be spent in Kosovo on an orderly
withdrawal of U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
The Senate is debating a similar measure that would requires
the president to begin pulling out the U.S. troops by July 2001
unless Congress voted to extend the deployment.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said earlier on
Wednesday that some Congressmen are "playing with fire" by
threatening to force "the premature withdrawal of U.S. troops from
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Some in Congress are threatening to force the premature
withdrawal of U.S. troops from Kosovo. This is playing with fire.
In the Balkans, signs of impatience can be misinterpreted as
symptoms of weakness," Albright said at a meeting of "the campaign
to preserve U.S. leadership."
</P>
<P>
Albright added that such a measure will prevent the United
States from achieving its goal in Southeast Europe.
</P>
<P>
"We will not achieve our goals in Southeast Europe if our eyes
are always on the clock and our focus is solely on what others do.
We are more than bookkeepers and spectators; we are leaders," she
added.
</P>
<P>
"And our fundamental objective in Southeast Europe is not to
leave; it's to win. Our job with our partners is to prevent
further violence and help democratic principles take root," she
noted.
</P>
<P>
She predicts that if the United States starts to leave the
region now, it will have to return to the Balkans "again and again.
"
</P>
<P>
"If we persist and succeed, we'll take a giant step towards a
Europe whole and free, where differences are settled peacefully
and wars just don't happen," she explained.
</P>
<P>
The United States currently deployed some 5,900 troops in
Kosovo. They entered the region last year with peacekeepers from
other countries last summer after the NATO conducted a 78-day air
campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Defense Secretary William Cohen stressed that he
would recommend President Clinton to veto any legislation that
suggests "an artificial deadline" for the U.S. to withdraw from
Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Two U.S. Congressional Committees Approve China Trade Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Two key committees in both the U.
S. House and Senate Wednesday approved the legislation to grant
permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status to China in a
victory for President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The House Ways and Means Committee approved the measure 34-4 as
previously undecided members on the panel supported the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
"This bill turns our relationship with China in a positive
direction," Ways and Means Committee Vice Chairman Philip Crane,
an Illinois Republican, said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the Senate Finance Committee approved the
measure 18-1.
</P>
<P>
William Roth, chairman of the committee, called the measure "a
defining moment in our relationship with China."
</P>
<P>
"It is one of the most important pieces of legislation that we
have faced in the past decade," he said.
</P>
<P>
The House and Senate will vote on the legislation respectively
in next week and early June.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the bill will be surely approved in the Senate
but the vote in the House can be very close.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which would do away with annual reviews of China's
trade status, has the strong support of the Clinton administration
and business groups but is opposed by organized labor and some
human rights groups, particularly in the House.
</P>
<P>
The Untied States and China last year signed an agreement on
China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), under
which the U.S. will grant PNTR status to China. The agreement
will be effective only after being approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton warned Wednesday that rejecting PNTR with
China would invite "a future of dangerous confrontation and
constant insecurity."
</P>
<P>
Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush also urged
Congress to pass the legislation, saying it was a "pressing
question that will not wait until the next president takes office.

<HEADLINE> Angola Refuses to Attend OAU Summit in Togo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Angola said Wednesday that it will
not participate in the forthcoming summit of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) to be held in Togo in July this year because
it was accused of supporting the Angolan rebels.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the decision, Joao Lourenco, secretary-general of
the ruling People's Movement for Liberation of Angola (MPLA), said
the decision on the summit venue made by the OAU will affect the
credibility of the international organization, the official radio
station RNA reported.
</P>
<P>
But a senior Angolan foreign ministry official was quoted as
saying that Angola wanted to achieve a consensus that the meeting
would not take place in Togo in July.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the campaign against the Lome summit
was "not retaliation" against Togo, but "a matter of respecting
United Nations Security Council resolutions".
</P>
<P>
A report published in late February by head of the U.N. Angola
Sanction Committee Robert Fowler named Togo as one of the
countries violating sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council
against the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council then decided to tighten the embargo
on arms, diamond and fuel against UNITA.

<HEADLINE> 1 Iraqi Killed, 4 Wounded in U.S., British Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 17 (Xinhua) -- A 12-year-old boy was killed and
four others injured Wednesday in U.S. and British warplanes' air
raids on southern Iraq, a military spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said that at 10:00 local time (0600 GMT), nine formations of
U.S. and British planes made 18 armed sorties over the southern
provinces of Basra, Misan, Muthana, Qadissiya, Thi-Qar, Wasit and
Najaf. The warplanes bombed the Tauq Al-Ghazal village in the Najaf
province, causing the casualties and damaging several farms, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi air defenses fired missiles at the invading planes,
forcing them to retreat to their bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait,
said the spokesman, quoted by the official Iraqi News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that at 18:10 local time (1410 GMT) Tuesday,
seven formations of U.S. and British jets coming from bases in
Turkey made 14 armed sorties over northern Iraq. They met Iraqi
anti-aircraft gun-fire and missiles, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the total number of armed sorties
made by U.S. and British planes since December 1998 have reached
21,197, among them 3,964 from Turkey, and 17,233 from Saudi Arabia
and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British planes have been patrolling and enforcing
the two no-fly zones in the north and south of Iraq they imposed in
the wake of the 1991 Gulf War, triggered by Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraq does not recognize the zones, which are not specifically
covered by any United Nations resolution. The United States and
Britain claim that their strikes are aimed at military objectives
when their planes are targeted by Iraqi defenses.

CAIRO, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Arab Journalists Union said on

It called on the international community to intervene to stem
the bloodshed and end Israeli aggression on the Palestinian people

<HEADLINE> Putin Moves to Tighten Reign on Regions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 17 (Xinhua) -- In a fresh move to tighten control
over the regions, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced
Wednesday that he would submit to the State Duma a package of
bills "strengthening and cementing Russian statehood."
</P>
<P>
In a televised address to the nation, Putin announced the main
bill would change the principle of formation of the Federation
Council, the upper house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Under the new document, the regional leaders would concentrate
on their work in the regions, and their representatives would
start making laws in the parliament's upper house, but now on a
permanent basis.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Putin is also proposing that a procedure for
recalling regional chiefs and dissolving local legislative
assemblies be written into law.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the regional leader's power to remove subordinate
officials from office would also be written into law.
</P>
<P>
Putin said the proposed moves were intended to make "the
legislative and executive powers truly effective."
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the regional leaders should still be
publicly elected.
</P>
<P>
"These submitted bills are not directed against regional
leaders,who should remain the pillars of the president," Putin
explained.
</P>
<P>
He urged the deputies of the two houses of parliament to drop
their political and party-oriented ambitions and concentrate on a
practical matter -- the strengthening of the Russian state system.
</P>
<P>
Putin's announcement Wednesday came after his decree issued
last week to carve the country into seven districts, each with its
own presidential representative.
</P>
<P>
The new representatives will replace those who now work in 80
of the 89 regions in accordance with a 1997 presidential decree
signed by former President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The new representatives are to report directly to the president
and are charged with "guaranteeing the realization of the
constitutional powers of the head of state."
</P>
<P>
Last week, Putin put to use his constitutional authority over
the regions by suspending decrees of the leaders of Ingushetia and
the Amur region. He also told Bashkortostan to bring its
constitution in line with federal law.

PARIS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika will pay a state visit to France from June 13 to 16 at
the invitation of French President Jacques Chirac, announced the
Elysee presidential palace on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first visit to France by a head of state of
Algeria in nearly two decades and will concretize a full
normalization of relations between the two countries, tightly
interwound because of historical and cultural reasons.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Bashir Boumaza, president of the National
Council or upper house of Algerian parliament, Chirac said that he
was looking forward to receiving Bouteflika at the airport on June
13,according to Elysee presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna.
</P>
<P>
While expressing his commitment to Franco-Algerian relations,
Chirac said that the ties between the two countries were ``not
always easy.''
</P>
<P>
He praised Bouteflika for adopting a policy of returning to
cordial and close relations with France while protecting the
national identity of Algeria at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Relations between France and Algeria remained tense over the
past several years because of France's concern over the over-spill
of terrorism into Europe after the Algerian government started a
war with Islamic militants in the early 1990s.

</P>
<P>
The law has been passed by the State Duma lower house of

crowded remand centers, exceeding the capacity by 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The Russian prison and remand center population has reached 1,
084,000, of whom over 43,000 are women, 96,000 are suffering from
tuberculosis and more than 4,000 are infected with HIV, the virus

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. high-tech industry
workforce surged to 5 million in 1999, adding some 1.2 million
workers since 1993, according to a new report released Tuesday by
the American Electronics Association (AEA) and the Nasdaq Stock
Market.
</P>
<P>
The report said that all 50 states, the District of Columbia,
and Puerto Rico added new high-tech jobs between 1997 and 1998.
California, Texas, Virginia, Colorado, and Georgia  led the
nation in high-tech job creation.
</P>
<P>
California is the nation's technology powerhouse, employing 835,
000 workers in 1998. It was also the fastest growing state between
1993 and 1998, creating 193,000 new high-tech jobs. Texas ranked
second in overall high-tech employment, with 411,000 workers, and
ranks second in creation of new high-tech jobs, adding more than
132,000 new high-tech jobs between 1993 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
The annual average wage for the nation's high-tech workforce
was 58,000 U.S. dollars in 1998, compared with the average private
sector wage of 32,000 dollars, an 82 percent differential.
</P>
<P>
"Today's U.S. high-tech industry is not only invigorating and
sustaining the American economy but that of most states as well,"
said William T. Archey, AEA president and CEO. "It is now an
industry whose scope, dynamism and impact extends from sea to sea.
"
</P>
<P>
The report also showed that U.S. high-tech exports totaled 181
billion dollars in 1999, 85 percent higher than that in 1993.
California led the nation in high-tech exports with 53 billion
dollars. It was followed by Texas (25 billion dollars),
Massachusetts (9 billion dollars), Florida (8 billion dollars) and
New York (7.6 billion dollars).

ADDIS ABABA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- World Trade Organization (WTO)
Director- General Mike Moore on Wednesday described his visit to
Ethiopia as successful.
</P>
<P>
Upon his departure after a three-day working visit, Moore told
reporters that his discussions with Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi and other government ministers were constructive.
</P>
<P>
Moore said that Ethiopia is finalizing studies on joining the
WTO.
</P>
<P>
Meles told Moore during the talks on Tuesday that the Ethiopian
 government needed to assess the WTO's rules and regulations,
rights and duties seriously before applying for membership, the
Ethiopian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Addis Ababa, Moore also held talks with the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) Secretary-General Salim Ahmed
Salim.
</P>
<P>
The discussion between Salim and Moore centered on Africa's
concerns in the WTO and on how to make the world trade body more
responsive to the needs of Africa in particular and to those of
developing countries in general, OAU said in a press release
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
They underscored the importance of strengthening Africa's
participation in the WTO and both sides emphasized the need for
increased technical assistance to African countries as well as
higher capacity building to ensure their active involvement in the
global trade negotiation, the release said.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Govt Urges Donors to Resume Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibar government
Wednesday appealed to donors to reconsider their decision of
suspending aid to the Indian Ocean islands because it is against
human rights.
</P>
<P>
Addressing journalists at the Tanzanian Information Services
Center here, spokesman for the Zanzibar government Hafidh Ali
Tahir called on donors to support a process which will help
Zanzibar's development rather than supporting political seminars
and workshops that further worsen the political situation in the
Isles.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said donors are equally violating human rights by
denying the Zanzibar people's right to enjoy their support.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar Minister of State in the President's Office Mohammed
Ramia said there is no reason for donors to maintain the decision
after the commonwealth-brokered agreement between the ruling Chama
Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) and the opposition Civic United Front (CUF)
was signed in June last year.
</P>
<P>
A Zanzibar mission, which comprises four ministers and several
directors, is in Dar es Salaam to clarify the political situation
in the Spice Isles.
</P>
<P>
The government wants to do away with the culture of listening
to the opposition side while remaining quiet itself, explained
Ramia who is the head of the mission.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar has faced political deadlock since Salmin Amour was
narrowly elected in October 1995 for a second term as president of
the islands, which form half of the Tanzanian Union.
</P>
<P>
The CUF refused to accept the result. The party's Deputy
Secretary- General Nassor Seif Amour was arrested with 12 others
in November 1997 after telling people at a political rally to
prepare for bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
Five more party members were arrested in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
Donor countries have refused to grant new aid to the islands in
protest against the election result.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Inflation Expected to Rise Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's inflation rate is
expected to rise sharply in June this year owing to the
inflationary pressures that still prevail on the market, an
economist said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Howard Sithole told the Zimbabwe News Agency that the
year-on-year inflation which had been on the decline from October
last year to early February this year was expected to rise as
nothing was being done to control it.
</P>
<P>
He said inflation came down from 70.4 percent in October to
48.9 percent in February and rose again to 50.8 percent in March
and 53.7 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
"There is no way that inflation can be brought down now as the
government is doing virtually nothing to control the inflationary
pressures. We expect it to continue rising," he said.
</P>
<P>
The country's economy has been experiencing a high inflationary
 environment which saw interest rates rising to more than 60
percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The joint Cyprus-Greece military
exercises, code-named "Vergina-Toxotis," entered the second day on
Wednesday, the Cyprus News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Defense Minister Socrates Hasikos said the three-day war-
game, kicked off on Tuesday, is held within the framework of
cooperation between the Cyprus National Guard and the Greek air and
naval forces.
</P>
<P>
"It is a programmed exercise and it will take place in
accordance with the plans and programme. It is more a training
exercise than anything for our anti-missile handlers and Greek
fighter plane pilots," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup in Nicosia seeking union with
Greece.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Greece in November 1993 agreed on a joint defense
doctrine providing air, sea and land cover to the island by the
Greek armed forces in the event of another Turkish offensive.
</P>
<P>
Heavily armed Turkish forces have remained in the northern part
of Cyprus since 1974.

<HEADLINE> Bill Banning Refugees' Return Gets First Approval in Israeli Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Knesset (parliament)
in a preliminary reading Wednesday passed a bill denying the right
of return for Palestinian refugees with a vote of 68-22, with one
abstention.
</P>
<P>
The bill, however, has to pass three other readings in
parliament before it becomes law.
</P>
<P>
The bill, submitted by the right-wing opposition Likud party
Knesset member Yisrael Katz, calls for banning the return of
Palestinian refugees to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Minister in Prime Minister's Office, Haim Ramon, again
said the bill itself was superfluous. He declared that no single
refugee will be allowed to come back under the Right of Return.
</P>
<P>
He said the return of refugees will mean the destruction of the
Jewish state. Israeli government officials have also repeatedly
voiced the stand in contacts with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Ramon added, however, the government would agree to some family
reunions on the basis of humanitarian grounds.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the Palestinian authorities,
about 350,000 Palestinians were driven abroad during the 1948 and
1967 Arab-Israeli wars, most of whom now sheltering in Lebanon,
Jordan and Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian authorities have been fighting for the right of
return for refugees, which is also one of the thorniest issues to
be tackled in the Israel-Palestinian final-status talks. Other
tough issues include the fate of Jerusalem, the future of
settlements, water resources and border.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, the Knesset gave an initial go-ahead to
another bill raised by the Likud party to bar any changes over the
status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have been engaging in a new
round of talks since April 30 aimed at settling the interim issues
and reaching a framework agreement for the final-status talks. So
far, they made little progress and miss ed another deadline on May
13.
</P>
<P>
To boost the lagging talks, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
proposed to transfer three Arab villages outside Jerusalem
currently under the Israeli security control and Palestinian
civilian control to full Palestinian control. The plan managed to
get endorsed on Monday at the cabinet and the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Barak reportedly intends to hand over the villages, Abu Dis,
Azariya and Swahara, to the Palestinians ahead of his trip to the
United States on Saturday. He is scheduled to meet U.S. President
Bill Clinton early next week to discuss ways to advance the peace
talks.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Journalists Punished for Libel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 17 (Xinhua) -- A Cairo court sentenced a deputy
editor of Egypt's Islamist Al-Shaab newspaper to six months in
prison Wednesday and fined four of his colleagues for libeling a
businessman.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Sabur, board chairman of Cairo's Shooting Club and Bank
al-Mohandis, filed a lawsuit against the journalists in April last
year, accusing them of defaming him in 36 editions of the paper,
the country's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The bi-weekly paper, the mouthpiece of Egypt's opposition Labor
Party, alleged that Sabur had stolen Libyan state secrets in the
mid-1970s and committed infractions in his work at the Shooting
Club.
</P>
<P>
Cairo's Bulaq district misdemeanors court imprisoned the deputy
editor, Talaat Rumeih, and fined writers Adel Hussein and Amer
Abdel Munim, chief editor Magdi Hussein and cartoonist Essam Hanafi
7,500 Egyptian pounds (2,180 U.S dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
Magdi Hussein and Essam Hanafi are serving prison terms for
libeling Deputy Prime Minister and Agriculture Minister Youssef
Wali. The two men plus Adel Hussein were also fined 20,000 Egyptian
pounds (5,800 dollars) each in the case.
</P>
<P>
Each of the five was ordered to pay Sabur 501 pounds (around 150
dollars) for compensation.

<HEADLINE> Attempted Assassins of Iranian Reformist Sent to Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Iranian judiciary announced on
Wednesday that the attempted assassins of Saeed Hajjarian, the
reformist ally of Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, were
sentenced to prison terms following a haste trial.
</P>
<P>
Saeed Asgar, a chemistry student who opened fire on Hajjarian on
March 12, was sentenced to 15 years in prison on charges of
activities against national security and would be jailed in
Isfahan, the central Isfahan province, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, deputy chairman of Tehran Municipal Council and
former deputy intelligence minister, was seriously injured but
recovered after a long coma.
</P>
<P>
Asgar was also charged of shooting dead Abuqassem Shafei, a
resident in Shahr-e Rey, a satellite town in southern Tehran, the
Tehran Justice Department said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Seyyed Mohsen Majidi, who helped Asgar to carry out
the assassinations against Hajjarian and Shafei, was sentenced to
10 years imprisonment and would be jailed in Shiraz, the southern
Fars province.
</P>
<P>
The No. 3 culprit, Mohammad Ali Moqadami, who handed over a
letter to Hajjarian preparing the ground for the assassination
attempt, was sentenced to seven years in jail and would serve his
term in Kermanshah, the western Kermanshah province.
</P>
<P>
Two more defendants involved in the assassination attempt
against Hajjarian were sentenced to four and three years in prison
respectively while three others were acquitted.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic revolutionary court issued verdicts on Hajjarian's
assassins after three court hearings and all the convicted
defendants confessed to the assassination attempt and claimed that
they carried out the attempt "in defense of the Islamic regime."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian authorities claimed that the assassins carried out
the assassination attempt on their own and out of personal feelings
and motivations.
</P>
<P>
However, public opinion believed that the attempt was a revenge
against Hajjarian by the conservatives, who still dominate the
country's most sensitive organs.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, managing director of the banned reformist daily Sobh-
e Emrouz (This Morning), played an important role in the
reformists' landslide victory in the February parliamentary
polling, which humiliated the powerful conservatives.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Summons Israeli Ambassador for Obstruction of Civilian Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian foreign ministry summoned
Israeli Ambassador Zvi Mazel on Wednesday over Israel's obstruction
of aircraft using Gaza airport in the Palestinian self-rule areas,
Assistant Foreign Minister Mohammed al-Orabi said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Orabi told reporters that they discussed "the repeated
obstruction by Israeli warplanes of civilian planes heading to Gaza
airport in the territory of the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA)." But he did not give details.
</P>
<P>
He said they also discussed the various tracks of the Arab-
Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Israeli security forces blocked flights of the
Gaza airport for two days, and two Israeli warplanes prevented an
Egyptian airliner from landing in Gaza, reportedly because of a
dispute with Egypt over flight paths approaching the Palestinian-
run Gaza airport.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security officials also refused to allow a Moroccan
flight to land and another plane to depart for Jordan on the same
day.
</P>
<P>
Reports have said that Egypt recently used a new air corridor to
replace the old route north of el-Arish, capital of North Sinai
Governorate. But Israel has not agreed to the change.
</P>
<P>
Aviation officials from both countries planned to hold talks
Tuesday in Cairo on the issue of air routes, but postponed the
meeting due to busy schedules of the Israeli side, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Israel controls the Gaza Strip's airspace under interim peace
agreements with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Gaza airport, widely seen as a symbol of the sovereignty of the
PNA, was opened in late 1998 following the United States-brokered
Wye River peace agreement between the PNA and Israel.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Intentions Put to Test: Palestinian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The coming few weeks are critical for
Israel to prove that its intentions to negotiate with Palestinians
and reach a framework agreement on final status issues were
authentic, a senior Palestinian official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Abu-Redinah, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's advisor,
told reporters that the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations and
discussions were going on and would continue on various levels for
some months to come.
</P>
<P>
The gap was still big between the two sides as there have been
no agreement, nor any progress, he stressed. Therefore, he said,
the coming weeks would put to the test Israel's real intentions.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official disclosed that there were U.S and Arab
efforts, specially by Egypt and Jordan, to push the Middle East
peace process forward and help the Palestinian and Israeli
negotiators reach an overdue framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
What was needed now was more efforts and pressure by the U.S on
Israeli government to implement the signed deals with Palestinians,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The back-channel Palestinian-Israeli talks would continue in
Stockholm, Sweden on Thursday in a bid to conclude the long-awaited
final status framework agreement in advance of the final peace
treaty next September, Abu-Redinah said.
</P>
<P>
The new channel of negotiations was approved by Arafat,
reminiscent of the secret talks the two sides conducted in Norway
in 1993 which produced the historic Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, Palestinian negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo, who
has been negotiating since September with his Israeli counterpart
Oded Eran on final status issues, resigned in anger at the
Stockholm talks without his knowledge. The resignation was rejected
by Arafat.
</P>
<P>
U.S Middle East Peace Envoy Denis Ross arrived in the region on
Monday in a new effort to bring back on track the sluggish
Palestinian-Israeli peace process which again missed a May 13
deadline to reach a framework deal.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Discusses Peace Process With Greek President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
Wednesday discussed with visiting Greek President Costis
Stephanopulos the latest developments of the Middle East Process
Process and efforts to push it forward.
</P>
<P>
During the talks in the West Bank town of Bethlehem, Arafat
reviewed with his guest "the oppressive practices by Israeli
soldiers" against the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Those practices include settlement activities, Judaizing
Jerusalem, and besieging Bethlehem, Arafat said, quoted by the
Palestinian News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed Stephanopulos on the obstacles facing the
Palestinian-Israeli talks, criticizing "the Israeli side for
failing to meet the commitments enshrined in the signed
agreements."
</P>
<P>
They also talked about the bilateral ties and the means to
develop and promote relations for the benefit of both peoples.
</P>
<P>
Stephanopulos and his party arrived in Bethlehem earlier
Wednesday on a state visit to Palestine as part of a regional tour.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's advisor, Nabil Abu-Redinah, told reporters that
Stephanopulos' visit to Palestine reiterated Greece's firm and
supportive stand towards the "Palestinian cause and the legitimate
rights of the Palestinian people."
</P>
<P>
Wednesday afternoon, the Greek president was attacked with eggs
by some Palestinians during his call on the Jewish Wailing Wall in
Jerusalem, in protest of his refusal to meet Palestinian officials
in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel declared the whole of Jerusalem, including the eastern
part it captured during the 1967 Middle East War, as its "eternal
and undivided capital." However, the Palestinians want the
traditional East Arab Jerusalem as capital of their future
independent state.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Rules Out Possibility of Cabinet Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit on
Wednesday dismissed speculation that a cabinet reshuffle may follow
the new president's assuming office.
</P>
<P>
"I told Mr. President that there is no need for a government
change and (Ahmet Necdet) Sezer agrees with that," said Ecevit,
according to a report of the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit told reporters that Mesut Yilmaz, leader of the
Motherland Party (ANAP), a junior partner of the tripartite
coalition, can join any cabinet meeting whenever he wishes.
</P>
<P>
The 57th Turkish government, which assumed office on June 9 last
year, has survived one crisis after another in the past 11 months.
The government was formed by Ecevit-led Democratic Left Party
(DSP), Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) and ANAP.
</P>
<P>
It was widely speculated that Yilmaz, who has no position in the
government, was seeking the post of foreign minister, a move may
lead to major changes of some cabinet posts involving the three
coalition parties.
</P>
<P>
The speculation was reinforced by the resignation of State
Minister Mehmet Ali Irtemcelik on May 6 and dismissal from the
cabinet of State Minister Sadi Somuncuoglu on May 8 upon the demand
of the MHP general leadership.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit argued that "I feel no need for a change in the
government as it works harmoniously. The president told me that he
also didn't think that was necessary."
</P>
<P>
Ecevit has attached great importance to maintaining the
country's political stability so as to concentrate efforts on
development and make full preparations for accession into the
European Union, a 15-member rich-nation club.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is notorious for frequent government changes. During the
seven-year term in office of former President Suleyman Demirel, he
witnessed eight governments successively in office.
</P>
<P>
"The whole world has seen that this government is one that has
worked very productively and very fast," Ecevit said.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly there is a time limit on the things that can be done,
yet I suppose nobody can claim that we have ignored certain
targets," he added.

<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, May 17 (Xinhua) -- German Defense Minister Rudolf
Scharping is against the reduction of the German armed force.
</P>
<P>
According to the German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung,
Scharping hopes that the German armed force,the Bundeswehr, should
maintain a strength of 280,000.
</P>
<P>
Scharping will offer his proposal next week.
</P>
<P>
The Weizsaecker Committee, a committee led by the former
German President Richard Weizsaecker, will release a report next
week to call for reduction of the Bundeswehr to 240,000.
</P>
<P>
The Bundeswehr was founded in 1955. After Germany's
reunification in 1990 the Bundeswehr had 370,000 troops and up to
now it keeps 320,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
Last year the German soldiers took part in the combat
operation for the first time since the end of World War II.

<HEADLINE> Key U.S. Senate Panel Approves PNTR for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legislation, approved by a vote of 18-1 in the committee,
must pass the full Senate and the House of Representatives. The
House is scheduled to vote on the measure next week.
</P>
<P>
Senator Jim Jeffords, R-Vt, was the only one among the 20
committee members, who voted against the bill. One member was
absent.
</P>
<P>
William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the committee, called the
measure "a defining moment in our relationship with China." "It
is one of the most important pieces of legislation that we have
faced in the past decade."
</P>
<P>
"The committee's action on permanently normalizing our trade
and relations with China will, first and foremost, measure our
commitment to breaking down barriers to America exports for the
benefit of American farmers, industry, and workers," Roth added.
</P>
<P>
Also addressing the panel, Senator Max Baucus, a strong
supporter of the legislation, also stressed the importance of the
passage.
</P>
<P>
He repeated his warning that if the United States does not
grant PNTR to China, it will lose the advantage of China's "
unprecedented opening of its markets to American and other foreign
agricultural products, manufactured goods, and services."
</P>
<P>
"If we don't, then our Japanese and European competitors will
be active in China's market, while American farmers, ranchers,
workers, and businesses will be left behind," he added.
</P>
<P>
Later on Wednesday, the House Ways and Means Committee is also
expected to approve the bill. The approval of the measure by
Congress will do away with annual reviews of China's trade status.
</P>
<P>
The Untied States and China last year signed an agreement on
China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), under
which the U.S. will grant China PNTR. The agreement will be
effective only after being approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say there is no problem for the bill to be approved in
the Senate while the votes can be very close in the House.

<HEADLINE> Two Greek Pilots Charged With Manslaughter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The two pilots of the Greek
government's Falcon plane, involved in a freak accident on a
flight from Athens to Bucharest late last year, were charged
Wednesday by the Athens prosecutor with manslaughter and bodily
harm.
</P>
<P>
A team of specialists attributed the accident to human error,
the Macedonian Press Agency (MPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The pilots were accused of maintaining an excessive speed,
wrong handling at the controls of the plane that blocked the
automatic pilot system and not warning the passengers to fasten
their seatbelts in time.
</P>
<P>
It was also decided that an inquiry would be underway to
determine the responsibilities if any of the technicians in charge
of the plane's maintenance.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Developing Countries Defend Principle in U.N. Peacekeeping Financing (By Gu Zhenqiu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Many developing countries
have called for efforts to uphold the "capacity to pay" principle
in financing the U.N. peacekeeping operations, saying that any
unilateral attempt to challenge the principle and revise the scale
of assessment is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
They also demanded that major contributor, the United States,
honor their obligations by paying their back dues, and due
considerations be given to the specific economic conditions in the
developing countries, particularly the small and least developed
ones.
</P>
<P>
The unequivocal statements came as the General Assembly
Tuesday kicked off a debate on the cost and future of the U.N.
peacekeeping operations, the core responsibility of the 188-member
world body under the U.N. Charter. The debate opened at a critical
time when the United Nations suffered a setback in the current
hostage crisis in Sierra Leone and is considering the military
deployment in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 developing countries and
China, the Nigerian permanent representative to the United Nations,
Arthur Mbanefo, said that it was significant that peacekeeping
financing was under discussion while events in Sierra Leone had
drawn world attention to the U.N. peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of May, some 500 U.N. peacekeepers were taken
hostage by the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) while the
United Nations was deploying its blue-helmet soldiers in rebel
strongholds.
</P>
<P>
"Peacekeeping operations are an important function of the
United Nations and, therefore, should be provided with adequate
resources," he said. "The financial problems of the Organization
are not linked to the peacekeeping scale and can be solved if
Member States, in particular the major contributor, take concrete
action to settle their arrears and honor their obligations."
</P>
<P>
The total amount of peacekeeping expenditures is expected to
jump from some 800 million U.S. dollars in the last fiscal year to
1.9 billion U.S. dollars this year. However, arrears totalled some
2 billion U.S. dollars at the end of March, of which about half
was owed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
All U.N. Member States pay their portion of the total
peacekeeping costs. The U.S. lengthy reluctance to pay the arrears
in full, on time and without any condition has plunged the world
body into grave financial difficulties, including poor financing
for its peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
The United States is lobbying hard to get the unilateral cut
on its share of the U.N. regular budget and peacekeeping budget,
two main components of the U.N. assessments.
</P>
<P>
The Group of 77 developing countries and China rejected "any
attempt to modify the scale for peacekeeping through the
imposition of unilateral conditions," Mbanefo said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dumisani Kumalo, representative of South Africa,
said that efforts must be made to take into consideration the
economic conditions of developing countries as they, particularly
the least developed ones, have limited capacity to pay their dues.
</P>
<P>
"Any unilateral attempt to modify the scale through
conditionalities is unacceptable, and any significant modification
will be considered only if it spread the burden of payment, in
accordance with capacity to pay," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sotirios Zackheos, representative of Cyprus, said, "The
financing of peacekeeping operations must be based on the capacity
to pay and should be reviewed periodically. It should take due
consideration of the special needs of small states, as well as
those of the least developed countries."
</P>
<P>
The principle of capacity to pay means that any Member States
pay its assessment in accordance with its share of the Gross
National Product (GNP) in the total of the world's GNP.
</P>
<P>
"The principle of capacity to pay is essential," he said. "
That principle applies to most countries."
</P>
<P>
Shamshad Ahmad, representative of Pakistan, "It is regrettable
that, at such a time, the United Nations finds itself in an
uncertain and precarious financial situation, which threatened the
solvency and stability of peacekeeping operations."
</P>
<P>
The statements from the developing world was also echoed by
some allies of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of Canada and Australia, Michael Powles of
New Zealand, said, "The scale should continue to be based on the
regular budget scale and capacity to pay."
</P>
<P>
"Some countries have been presenting the problems associated
with peacekeeping financing as if they were solely the making of
the United Nations and attribute to the fact that the peacekeeping
scale has not been revised since it was created in 1973," he said.
"This is not the whole story."
</P>
<P>
Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. permanent representative to the
United Nations, Tuesday called for a sweeping overhaul of the
United Nations peacekeeping operations and for more money from
member nations to make the operations effective.
</P>
<P>
However, Powles said, "Difficulties have been mainly caused by
Member States, in particular the United States, not paying their
assessments on time, in full and without conditions."

<HEADLINE> Security Volatile Along Border Between Zambia And Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Security situation in Zambia's North
Western region is still volatile, as local residents continue
their fleeing from assaults by cross-border Angolan soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The region's police chief Hudson Beenzu on Wednesday said here
that some 1,000 villagers had been displaced and the government
had set up three settling camps for them.
</P>
<P>
The villagers were too scared to return to their home near the
border with Angola to stay away from harassments by the
cross-border Angolan soldiers, who had been reportedly stealing
livestock and other valuables from the villagers.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 Angolan refugees also ran into the North Western
Province of the country every week to escape war in their home
country, added Beenzu.
</P>
<P>
To stabilize the situation, Zambian government has been taking
measures along the border to protect the vulnerable villagers,
according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba said on Tuesday that his
government was also trying to solve the problem through available
diplomatic channels.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican President Concerned Over Zambezi Valley Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano has expressed concern over delays in the implementation
of socio-economic projects in the Zambezi valley, that covers much
of the central provinces of Tete, Manica, Sofala and Zambezia.
</P>
<P>
He noted that, despite its high agricultural and mineral
potential, the Zambezi valley is still poorly developed.
</P>
<P>
An official source said on Wednesday that Chissano expressed
his concern during a recent meeting in Maputo with Prime Minister
Pascoal Mocumbi, the governors of the four provinces covered by
the Zambezi valley, and the general director of the Zambizi
Planning Office (GPZ).
</P>
<P>
"The President of the Republic expressed deep concern over the
way in which GPZ activities are being carried out, and gave a two
month deadline for the whole office, including the general
director, to be established in Tete City", said the source.
</P>
<P>
Chissano noted that if the GPZ were working smoothly, it would
attract more investments in agriculture, agro-industry, mining,
energy and infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
Some economists believe that the development of the Zambezi
valley is waiting for the rehabilitation of roads and the
rebuilding of the Sena rail line from the port of Beira to the
Moatize coal mines in Tete, but they also believe that "the GPZ
should be more dynamic, because there are things that can be done,
even without the railway".
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitation of the 500-kilometer line is budgeted at
about 342 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Recent studies show that Moatize has about 7.2 billion tons of
coal reserves, and the plan is to produce between five and 7.5
million tons of coal a year.
</P>
<P>
Besides coal, the Zambezi valley has about 5.5 million
hectares of arable land, more than 90 percent of which is still
underdeveloped.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Military Chiefs Meet Over S.Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Defence ministers and chiefs of staff
of the 16-member Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) began an emergency meeting Wednesday in Nigeria's capital
Abuja to discuss the crisis in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Defence Minister Thoephilus Danjuma told the opening
session that his country was considering to send more troops to
the flagging United Nations peacekeeping forces in the west
African country.
</P>
<P>
Danjuma said that Nigeria was currently engaged in discussions
with " some friendly countries to see how they can assist in
providing the necessary logistic support".
</P>
<P>
He noted that the question of "its mandate, logistics and
funding need to be amicably resolved" before Nigeria could deploy
additional two battalions in the country.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has had already four battalions of 3,500 soldiers
serving under the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the ECOWAS was considering to redeploy the
west African intervention forces, known as ECOMOG, to Sierra Leone
to restore peace and stability in that war-torn country after the
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels took about 500 U.N.
peacekeeping soldiers hostage.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian-led ECOMOG was replaced by the United Nations
peacekeeping forces in April this year under the Lome Peace Accord
signed in July 1999 by President Tejan Kabbah and the RUF led by
Foday Sankoh.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Urged to Address Regional Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GRAND BAIE, Mauritius, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi on Wednesday appealed to the 21-member Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) to resolve
conflicts in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The challenge is upon us to address the regional conflicts
that hamper trade, economic growth and development," Moi said at
the opening ceremony of the 5th COMESA summit here Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"The maintenance of peace and security in our region remains
critical to the success of COMESA," he said.
</P>
<P>
The report adopted by the COMESA foreign ministers' meeting in
Lusaka, Zambia, last month indicated that "conflicts, both within
and between states, have had a negative impact on trade and
economic development of our region", said Moi, who has served as
Chairman of the COMESA Authority over the past year.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than half of the COMESA member states have been
engaged in conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the Free Trade Area and regional peace and
security are high on the agenda of the three-day summit to be
closed on Friday.

<HEADLINE> European Union to Aid Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) is to
disburse, through its European Development Fund, 46.4 million euro
(about 41.7 million U.S. dollars), earmarked for the financing of
various development projects in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release from the Mozambican Foreign
Ministry on Wednesday, this funding falls under the country's
National Indicative Program with the EU.
</P>
<P>
The projects contemplated include an Institutional Capacity
Building Project for the Management of Water Resources and Supply
in the Zambezi valley; a project for the development of the
country's private sector; and a rural development project in the
provinces of Zambezia, Cabo Delgado and Inhambane.
</P>
<P>
As regards the water resources and supply project, which costs
11.6 million euro, the release says that its aim is to "contribute
to the sustainable and equitable development of water resources so
as to improve the well-being of the population in the Zambezi
valley, especially in the rural areas".
</P>
<P>
Another 4.8 million euro has been earmarked for the development
of the private sector, and it will contribute to the development
and integration of the Mozambican economy in the world market by
improving the sector's competitiveness. "As a result, it is hoped
that levels of income, employment and living standards for the
workers will increase", the release said.
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the money will be used in the areas of
agriculture, education, health and natural resources as part of a
rural development project.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Optimistic About Free Trade Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GRAND BAIE, Mauritius, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi, also outgoing Chairman of the Authority of the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), Wednesday
expressed his optimism about the Free Trade Area which is to be
in place later this year.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that we can build on the progress we have
already made to launch the Free Trade Area as scheduled on
October 31, 2000," Moi said here while addressing the opening
ceremony of the 5th Summit of COMESA.
</P>
<P>
"COMESA has already made considerable progress toward the
establishment of a Free Trade Area for our region," he said,
stressing that "at least 14 member states have published COMESA
tariffs with reductions ranging from 60 percent to 90 percent
being charged for goods originating from COMESA countries."
</P>
<P>
"In addition, most non-tariff barriers have been eliminated,"
the president said. "Indeed, the COMESA region is already a
working economic area, where most goods are moving across borders
on preferential terms."
</P>
<P>
He said that "over the past year, it has become clear to all of
us that the creation of a large market under the COMESA Free
Trade Area will create new opportunities for our economies."
</P>
<P>
"Apart from attracting greater local and foreign direct
investment, the COMESA Free Trade Area will stimulate economic
integration and lead to a more conducive macro-economic climate,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Moi, COMESA, in the process of removing barriers
to trade, has designed other programs and projects that are
complimentary to economic integration. These include the trade
facilitation procedures such as the yellow card scheme, air
traffic liberalization, liberalization of transit traffic,
establishment of a trade and development bank, a re-insurance
company, a clearing house, a court of justice and the adoption of
a common visa arrangement, among others.
</P>
<P>
"We have come a long way on a journey that has required courage
and vision. We have every reason to take pride in the progress
which we have made so far," Moi said.
</P>
<P>
However, the president warned that " there still remains some
unfulfilled promises to our people. We cannot rest until these
also become a reality."

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Remains as Favorite Emerging Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 17 (Xinhua) -- South Africa now ties with
Asia as fund managers' favorite emerging market, according to the
latest survey of South African fund managers by Merrill Lynch, a
U.S.-based consultancy agency.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows some 29 percent of fund managers favored South
Africa in May, down from 52 percent in April and 41 percent in
March, while 29 percent of fund managers favoring Asia, the same
as April, followed by Latin America at 24 percent, up from 19
percent the month before.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that while managers remain bullish on the
economy, they are less keen to buy stocks, even though a net 60
percent see them as undervalued.
</P>
<P>
Instead they appear to be preparing for future economic weakness
by turning positive on gilts. This trend is likely to continue if
South African economic optimism falls, said Merrill Lynch.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Summit Opens in Mauritius </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GRAND BAIE, Mauritius, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The 5th summit of the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) opened
here Wednesday afternoon in anticipation for the Free Trade Area
(FTA) which is scheduled to be in place by October 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Meeting has drawn a dozen heads of state and government,
including the presidents of Mauritius, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Zambia,
Namibia, Rwanda and Malawi.
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony started with the playing of the national
anthem of the Republic of Mauritius, and the COMESA song
expressing the unity for freedom of trade in COMESA region.
</P>
<P>
In his welcoming speech, Mauritius Prime Minister Navinchandra
Ramgoolam extended his warm welcome to the heads of state and
government of COMESA members coming for the summit. COMESA has
made remarkable progress toward regional integration and
especially toward the launching of the Free Trade Area, he said.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote address, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, who
has served as Chairman of the COMESA Authority over the past
year, reviewed the major international conferences and events
taking place last year which have a significant bearing on Africa
in general and on COMESA in particular.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the irreversibility of globalization, Moi noted
that developing and least-developed countries have joined hands
to ensure their full participation in the multilateral trading
system. He urged developing and least-developed countries,
including COMESA countries, to continue to insist that their
developmental concerns be adequately addressed by the World Trade
Organization before new issues can be considered.
</P>
<P>
"Increased production possibilities in agriculture is the key
to addressing the problem of rural poverty, which deter the
development of our nations," Moi said, noting that "access to the
markets of the developed countries is necessary for us to expand
trade opportunities that will lead to more rapid development of
our economies."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that "this summit will further strengthen
our resolve to create a COMESA Free Trade Area by October 31,
2000," adding that "I am confident, therefore, that we can build
on the progress we have already made to launch the Free Trade
Area as scheduled."
</P>
<P>
Director-General of the World Trade Organization Mike Moore,
Assistant Secretary-General Vijay Makhan of the Organization of
African Unity and African Economic Community and the
representative from the Europe Union were also invited to make
their speeches at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day summit, the heads of state and government
of the COMESA members will consider the report of the Secretary
General on the Activities of COMESA since the Nairobi Summit last
May.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also review and consider the report presented
by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers on the proceedings of
the 9th Meeting of the Council, which will cover such issues as
COMESA vision and strategy, the imminent launching of the Free
Trade Area, trade, customs and monetary affairs, and priority
projects in transport and communications.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Investment Environment Not Favorable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Crimes and uncertainty of
interest rates hamper investment by South African companies, a
survey released by the government Wednesday showed.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that local companies have little faith
in government initiatives to promote investment.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the result of the survey to South African National
Assembly's trade committee, the government's policy analyst
Stephen Gelb said uncertainty is the primary obstacle to
investment.
</P>
<P>
"Uncertainty is overwhelming for small businesses, who have
little confidence in socio-political issues and the overall
economic environment," Gelb said.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which was conducted on 1,425 South African
companies, found the level of investment by South African firms is
very low.
</P>
<P>
Both large and small companies attributed their lack of
investment to uncertainty over crime and interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Economic policy environment and labor regulations were also
listed as obstacles to investment.
</P>
<P>
Gelb said around two-thirds of companies believed that the
South African government officials do not understand business
problems, while three in four firms feel government do not take
their concerns into account when introducing policy changes.

<HEADLINE> HKEx to Remove Minimum Brokerage Commission in 2002 (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Board of Hong Kong Exchanges
and Clearing Limited (HKEx) Wednesday endorsed a proposal to
remove the rules which fix the respective minimum brokerage
commission rates for stock and futures transactions with effect
from April 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
After the proposals become effective, stockbrokers and futures
brokers will be free to negotiate commission rates with their
customers.
</P>
<P>
"The liberalization of commission rates opens an important
chapter for Hong Kong's stock and futures markets as it will lead
to freer and more healthy competition," said HKEx chairman Charles
Lee.
</P>
<P>
"It is both the regional and global trend to go for free
negotiation of brokerage commission rates. In order to maintain
its position as a leading international financial center and in
order to further develop its stock and futures markets into the
regional markets of choice of international investors, it is only
logical that Hong Kong should decide to remove the minimum
commission rules," Lee continued.
</P>
<P>
At present, 13 of the 15 largest stock markets, ranked by
market capitalization, in the world have adopted a system of free
negotiation.
</P>
<P>
These include the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom,
France, Germany, Canada, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland,
Spain, Australia, Sweden and Finland. The only two exceptions are
Hong Kong and Taiwan, ranking 10th and 13th, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Most major international derivatives exchanges have also
adopted a system of free negotiation, including exchanges in the
United States, the United Kingdom, France, Australia, Singapore
and South Korea.

<TEXT>
<P>
"HKEx considers that Hong Kong must take proactive and market-
driven initiatives in order to remain competitive in the world
market and to meet the challenges it will face in the light of
globalization and technological advancement," Lee stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The liberalization of brokerage commission rates is one such
initiative which, we believe, is in the interest of the investing
public, the brokerage industry and the economic well-being of Hong
Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, the decision regarding the two-year
transition to liberalization has been made after careful
consideration and was aimed at allowing brokers to prepare for the
change, if necessary, such as by improving cost-effectiveness and
productivity.
</P>
<P>
The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong
welcomed the move of HKEx, saying that "it has always been the
policy of the SFC to encourage measures by the industry to make
Hong Kong a cost effective place to conduct businesses."
</P>
<P>
"The proposal together with the reduction of the rate of stamp
duty on stock transactions by 10 percent which was announced in
the last budget speech will certainly enhance the competitiveness
of the Hong Kong markets," said a spokesman for the SFC.
</P>
<P>
The commission will consider the proposal as soon as possible,
said the spokesman. Under the Stock Exchanges Unification
Ordinance, any proposal that may lead to amendment of the rules
has to be sent to the Commission for approval before it is going
to take effect.

MANILA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen people were injured in an
explosion Wednesday afternoon inside a shopping center in Makati
City of Metro Manila, said a police report.
</P>

and just offshoot of earlier shooting incident in the shopping
center.

<HEADLINE> Michigan Governor in Support of PNTR With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- John Engler is one of the 43 U.S.
governors who signed a letter to Congress in late April in support
of permanent normal trade relations(PNTR) with China. The
Michiganian Republican wishes U.S.-China trade relations
permanently normal.
</P>
<P>
"I definitely support PNTR with China, and support China's
entry to the World Trade Organization(WTO)." Governor Engler said
in a recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Granting China the PNTR status will not only omit the annual
review of China's normal trade relations status, but also
accelerate China's entry to the WTO, the 51-year-old governor said.
</P>
<P>
Engler believed that China will further open its market if the
PNTR bill is passed before Congress.
</P>
<P>
In early this April, Engler led a Michigan state delegation to
visit Shanghai by Northwest's inaugural flight from Detroit to
Shanghai, where the state has set up an office and its General
Motor Corporation has a joint-venture factory.
</P>
<P>
"I have been to China for several times. Each time I was
impressed by the progress China has made," said Engler.
</P>
<P>
"Many people read in newspapers about Shanghai, and they know
it's a dynamic city," the governor added.
</P>
<P>
During the three-night stay in Shanghai, Governor Engler met
with Shanghai Mayor Xu Kuangdi and talked about the further
cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
There ought to be enormous potential cooperation since Shanghai
is China's largest commercial center and Michigan the leading
industrial state in the United States, Engler noted.
</P>
<P>
Besides auto industry, Michigan is strong in manufacturing,
electronic industry and highway construction. In addition,
Michigan has invested billions of dollars in recent years in the
development of information technology and is engaged in building
itself into a "smart state". Experience and technology in all
those fields, Engler said, are what Shanghai needs.
</P>
<P>
"We also can learn a lot of things from Shanghai," the governor
said. "For instance, Shanghai Municipal Council has worked out a
blueprint for the city in 2010, but Michigan has no such a long-
term plan."

LUSAKA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Security situation in Zambia's North
Western region is still volatile, as local residents continue
their fleeing from assaults by cross-border Angolan soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The region's police chief Hudson Beenzu on Wednesday said here
that some 1,000 villagers had been displaced and the government
had set up three settling camps for them.
</P>
<P>
The villagers were too scared to return to their home near the
border with Angola to stay away from harassments by the
cross-border Angolan soldiers, who had been reportedly stealing
livestock and other valuables from the villagers.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 Angolan refugees also ran into the North Western
Province of the country every week to escape war in their home
country, added Beenzu.
</P>
<P>
To stabilize the situation, Zambian government has been taking
measures along the border to protect the vulnerable villagers,
according to reports.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican President Concerned Over Zambezi Valley Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano has expressed concern over delays in the implementation
of socio-economic projects in the Zambezi valley, that covers much
of the central provinces of Tete, Manica, Sofala and Zambezia.
</P>
<P>
He noted that, despite its high agricultural and mineral
potential, the Zambezi valley is still poorly developed.
</P>
<P>
An official source said on Wednesday that Chissano expressed
his concern during a recent meeting in Maputo with Prime Minister
Pascoal Mocumbi, the governors of the four provinces covered by
the Zambezi valley, and the general director of the Zambizi
Planning Office (GPZ).
</P>
<P>
"The President of the Republic expressed deep concern over the
way in which GPZ activities are being carried out, and gave a two
month deadline for the whole office, including the general
director, to be established in Tete City", said the source.
</P>
<P>
Chissano noted that if the GPZ were working smoothly, it would
attract more investments in agriculture, agro-industry, mining,
energy and infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
Some economists believe that the development of the Zambezi
valley is waiting for the rehabilitation of roads and the
rebuilding of the Sena rail line from the port of Beira to the
Moatize coal mines in Tete, but they also believe that "the GPZ
should be more dynamic, because there are things that can be done,
even without the railway".
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitation of the 500-kilometer line is budgeted at
about 342 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Recent studies show that Moatize has about 7.2 billion tons of
coal reserves, and the plan is to produce between five and 7.5
million tons of coal a year.
</P>
<P>
Besides coal, the Zambezi valley has about 5.5 million
hectares of arable land, more than 90 percent of which is still
underdeveloped.

BRUSSELS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The president of the European
Union Commission, Romano Prodi, went on Wednesday to the eastern
Dutch town of Enschede to assess the damage caused by a
devastating explosion of a fireworks warehouse last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Prodi, who planned to study the situation there together with
Dutch authorities during his trip, will also assess the role the
European Union (EU) could play in assisting the rebuild of the
part of the town.
</P>

<P>
Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok announced on Tuesday the setting-
up of an investigation commission to probe into the cause of the
incident.

Rescuers worked through the last three days to try to find more
bodies and possible clues to the cause of the tragedy.

<HEADLINE> Romania's Economy Is Growing due to Exports: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 17 (Xinhua) -- It is obvious that Romania's
economy is enjoying a growth, said Romanian Prime Minister Mugur
Isarescu.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the daily Curentul published on Wednesday,
Isarescu said that the statistical data scored since the beginning
of the year 2000 shows that this economic growth is related to
exports.
</P>
<P>
A 25 percent rise in the exports inevitably means an economic
growth, Isarescu said. He explained that when Romania's exports
range between one third and one fourth of the GDP, their increase
brings about an economic growth even if other GDP factors remain
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also said he was aware of the fact that
citizens still think the economy is in a stagnation because their
life score no turning for the better yet despite the rise in the
exports.
</P>
<P>
Generally people's living standard will be seen improved about
3 months after the sign of economic growth appear, Isarescu said.
</P>
<P>
"Starting the second half of this year the economic growth will
be also mirrored in the living standing", Isarescu said.
</P>
<P>
Real wages will score a 1 to 1.5 percent rise during the whole
year 2000, Isarescu added. No matter how moderate this increase is,
it is full of hope for the future, as it relies on a sound,
lasting economic growth, he continued.
</P>
<P>
All this economic evolution means credibility guarantees for
Romania in its application to join the European Union, Isarescu
believed.

<HEADLINE> G8 Calls for Government-Enterprises Cooperation for Internet Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Group of Seven most
industrialized nations and Russia Wednesday called for close
cooperation between governments and enterprises in the fight
against crimes on internet, also known as "cybercrimes."
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued after three days of meeting here on
fighting cybercrimes, the eight countries said new or more rapid
solutions should be found to fight cybercrimes.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held after a virus named "ILOVEYOU" plagued a
part of the internet and e-mail system worldwide earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
Also discussed at the meeting were other criminal activities
taking place in the cyberspace, ranging from illegal pornography
advertisements to the use of false bank credit cards.
</P>
<P>
The participants said that in order to find better solutions to
check cybercrimes, governments and enterprises should work
together in this field.
</P>
<P>
But it fell short of mentioning a "co-regulation" by government
and enterprise in the sector, which is proposed by France but
strongly opposed by enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The private enterprises believe that they are the best placed
to fight cybercrimes because of their expertise in the field. They
are also skeptical about too much government intervention.
</P>
<P>
"The government and private sector share a common interest in
the fight against the illegal or prejudicial use of information
and communication technology... Dialogue between governments and
private sector is clearly essential," said the communique.
</P>
<P>
At the G8 Okinawa summit to be held in July, the heads of state
of the eight countries will also discuss and adopt a series of
principles aimed at fighting cybercrimes.
</P>
<P>
The principles include the protection of individual freedom and
private life, preserving government capacity to fight high-tech
crimes, and definition of a clear and transparent framework for
dealing with cybercrimes, said officials attending the meeting.

PARIS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- France decided on Wednesday to open
its gas market to competition and end the monopoly by the state-
owned Gaz de France.
</P>
<P>
State Secretary of Industry, Christian Pierret, said that the
French government adopted a draft law on modernizing the public
service of gas and developing gas enterprises in line with
relevant European Union directive on opening gas market.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase, 20 percent of the gas market of France, or
the provision of 25 million cubic meters of gas, will be opened to
competition from August 10.
</P>
<P>
28 percent of gas market will be opened to competition by 2003

<HEADLINE> Belarus Clarifies Defense Arrangements With Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko said Wednesday that the establishment of a combined
military force with Russia would not change the number of regular
troops in the region.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko said he is concerned over the United States' "
incorrect understanding" of matters related to the combined force,
the Interfax news agency reported in a dispatch from Minsk, the
Belarussian capital.
</P>
<P>
He said Washington has wrongly interpreted the plans of the two
allied countries to cooperate more closely in the sphere of
defense.
</P>
<P>
The Collective Security Council was founded on the basis of an
agreement on collective security signed by a number of members of
the Commonwealth of Independent States, an organization that
groups 12 of the 15 former Soviet republics, Lukashenko said.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a 300,000-strong military force, he said,
does not imply a beefing up of the army near NATO borders, and the
current number of regular troops in the region will not be changed.
</P>
<P>
Only in the event of military actions will the mobilization
capacities of the above-mentioned territories of the two states
make it possible to form a grouping some 300,000-strong by
drafting reserve servicemen, Lukashenko said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development Wednesday, the Belarussian House of
Representatives urged the U.S. administration and Congress to stop
putting political, economic and moral pressure on Belarus.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers called on Washington to observe the norms and
principles of international law in its relations with Minsk.
</P>
<P>
They were responding to a U.S. congressional resolution passed
on May 3 that Minsk described as "interference in the internal
affairs of Belarus and Russia," Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The statement, which includes suggestions for pressuring the
Russian government to withdraw from the creation of Russian-
Belarussian union, was also rejected by Moscow as "open
interference in Russia's internal affairs and relations between
the two independent states."
</P>
<P>
This U.S. resolution "grossly distorts the situation in Belarus
and the essence of Russian-Belarussian relations," the Russian
Foreign Ministry said in a statement earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
"It is strange that the American lawmakers, stubbornly ignoring
the obvious facts, groundlessly assert that the treaty on
establishing the union is supposed to undermine Belarus'
independence and the prospects of democracy and violates Russia's
international commitments," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Urges Flood, Drought Vigilance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao
said here today that the fight against floods and droughts is a
long-term and arduous task which can never be neglected.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national conference on flood and drought control,
Wen urged local governments to lose no time in repairing damaged
water conservancy infrastructure facilities, and come up with
plans to deal with possible floods. He also insisted that quality
construction is imperative in these efforts.
</P>
<P>
Wen, who heads the State Flood Control and Drought Relief
Headquarters, warned of faulty reservoirs and dams which may be
vulnerable to heavy rains during this summer's flood season.
</P>
<P>
He also demanded that officials in drought-stricken areas find
more water resources and popularize water-saving techniques for
agriculture to secure the grain harvest.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of Spring, regions north of the Yangtze
River have been seriously affected by drought due to little
precipitation and excessively windy days.
</P>
<P>
Wen, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist
Party of China Central Committee, urged Party members, government
officials, soldiers, experts, as well as common people to work
together to counter floods and drought.

visit to Israel and Palestinian self-rule areas last Sunday,
entered the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, one of the most famous
Christian holy sites in East Jerusalem, Greek diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
There is no immediate information about the motion of these egg
pelters, most of whom Arab youngsters, as Israeli policemen
escorting Stephanopoulos could not catch the protesters on the
spot.
</P>
<P>
However, most diplomatic analysts believe the reason behind the
humiliating protest was obviously the Greek president's refusal to
meet Palestinian officials in East Jerusalem, which harmed the
feelings of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian legislator Khatem Abdel Khader said Tuesday that
Stephanopoulos kept turning down Palestinian requests that he or
his foreign minister hold a symbolic meeting with Palestinian
officials in Orient House, the unofficial local headquarters of the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), or other sites in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Stephanopoulos held a meeting with Israel's
Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert on Monday, a move adding fuel to the
Palestinians' anger.
</P>
<P>
Khader confirmed that the Palestinians had complained the
incident to the Greek government, the European Union and the Arab
League, adding that the Greek position contradicts the traditional
friendship between Greece and the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic entanglement had forced the Greek president to
cut short his visit by one day, and to shift his meeting with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat from the West Bank city of
Ramallah to another self-rule city of Bethlehem, due to "security
reasons" as Palestinian official claimed.
</P>
<P>
Arafat had also cancelled a joint news conference with
Stephanopoulos to show his anger over the president's position on
the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Foreign guests' meeting with Palestinian representatives in East
Jerusalem is usually interpreted by the Palestinians as the silent
support for their righteous fight for the "liberation" of East
Jerusalem, which they see as the capital of their future
independent state.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israelis, stating that the whole Jerusalem is
the "eternal and undivided capital" of Israel, traditionally exert
pressure on foreign delegations to prevent such meetings.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman said on Monday that the reason for
Stephanopoulos' refusal of a meeting in East Jerusalem is that
Greece did not want to take any steps, even indirectly, that could
hurt the peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The status of Jerusalem, along with the return of Palestinian
refugees, the future of Jewish settlements, border, water and
security, are the major topics currently on the table of the
Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Unilaterally Release 460 Iraqi POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran will unilaterally free 460 Iraqi
prisoners of war (POWs) next week, Brigadier General Abdollah
Najafi, head of Iran's Special Commission on POWs said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Iran will hand over the POWs, captured during the 1980-1988
Iran-Iraq war, to the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC) on May 23, the officer was quoted by the Islamic Republic
News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He added that the ICRC in return has undertaken to follow up the
fate of 3,206 Iranian soldiers who, Iran insists, are still "
languishing in Iraqi prisons."
</P>
<P>
Najafi said Iran has proved its goodwill to Iraq several times
to solve the outstanding issue on POWs and those missing in action
while the Iraqi government has taken little step to help solve the
problem.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran has freed 50,019 Iraqi POWs in 106 stages while
Iraq has freed 39,417 Iranian POWs in 70 stages since the United
Nations brokered a ceasefire in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Iran unilaterally released a total of 2,479 Iraqis between April
8 and May 4, but Iraq said almost 9,000 more were still being held.
</P>
<P>
The issue of POWs is a key stumbling block to the normalization
of ties between the two former foes.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Hikes Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the Philippines
increased Wednesday its key policy rates by 50 basis points,
bringing the country's overnight borrowing and lending rates to 9.
50 percent and 11.75 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said in a statement that the policy rate
adjustment is in line with the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to
raise the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to keep U.S.
inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
According to the central bank, the adjustment reflects a
forward-looking monetary policy response to the possible future
rise in inflation rate and the continued depreciation of the
Philippine peso.
</P>
<P>
"The rise in policy rates is also expected to stem the outflow
of dollars that may result from a narrow differential between
domestic and foreign interest rates," it said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also pointed out that bank lending rates need
not necessarily follow the rise in policy rates given the
generally liquid position of the banking system and the relatively
low demand for loans.

<HEADLINE> EU Warns Uganda on Donor Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) Tuesday
warned the Ugandan government that the conflict in Kisangani could
jeopardize donor support for the country's next three budgets, the
New Vision reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The EU would only implement budgetary support depending on
Uganda's commitment to both accords, the resolution of the current
conflict with Rwanda in Kisangani and if defense expenditure is
kept at under two percent of its Gross Domestic Product, said
Bernard Ryelandt, head of the EU delegation to Uganda.
</P>
<P>
"The relationship between the EU and Uganda is at stake. This
could jeopardize our budgetary support," Ryelandt was quoted as
saying. He added the warning is also applied to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"We have a common wish to go in one direction, but progress
will be linked to how Uganda and Rwanda implement the agreements
and respect defense expenditure," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ryelandt said the trend of budget support is to be looked at
stage by stage with the agreements, and the impact will be seen in
the course of events.
</P>
<P>
EU countries present at the Public Expenditure Review meeting
held in Kampala voiced support for the warning before confirming
pledges of 2.4 billion U.S. dollars in budget support for the next
three years.
</P>
<P>
The EU had written to Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
requesting for a meeting to discuss the Kisangani conflict and its
impact on relations with EU member countries, the report quoted a
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan and Rwandan troops clashed on May 5 and 8 in Kisangani,
a northeast city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Museveni
and his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame have agreed to
demilitarize the city and resolve all the obstacles that let to
the recent clashes in the Sunday summit at Mwanza town of
Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Pledges to Stiffen Sanctions Against UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States is determined to
stiffen the U.N. Security Council's sanctions against the Angolan
rebels led by Jonas Savimbi, the U.S. Ambassador to Angola Joseph
Sullivan was quoted here on Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said on the state-owned Radio Nacional de Angola
that the U.S. government will apply the recommendations contained
in the Fowler's report, put forward by the head of the UN Angola
Sanction Committee, which accused some European and African
countries of giving logistic goods to the Savimbists.
</P>
<P>
Sullivan justified the U.S. stand with the fact that Jonas
Savimbi is the only one responsible for the war in Angola. The
U.S. Has expressed the support for the recent U.N. Security
Council's resolution concerning the need to apply stricter
sanctions against the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA), said the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
According to the diplomat, there should be more strictness in
the application of the sanctions against Jonas Savimbi and his
followers as the peace is a priority.
</P>
<P>
The United States has repeatedly announced its new policy on
the issue of the Angolan situation since the Angolan government
troops had gained advantage over the rebels in the battle field.
</P>
<P>
The United States, the largest oil-explorer in the southwest
African country, has realized the importance of the relations with
the Angolan government which has the total control of the offshore
oil fields.
</P>
<P>
On the accord signed between Angola, the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, Sullivan said it will facilitate
the pardoning of Angola's external debt to the U.S. and help
increase investment between the two countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Banking sector Wednesday
urged a more robust export stance by the country's manufacturers
to take full advantages of Southern Africa's integration tides.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, a major bank of the country, said
in a report that export opportunities are surging with the
reduction of barriers to cross-border trade and flow of investment
in southern African sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean enterprises should profitably ride on the ample
benefits of trade liberalization and integration in the sub-region
under the auspices of the Southern Africa Development Community
and Common Markets for Eastern and Southern Africa, suggested the
bank.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers, using local resources in the industries of food,
 furniture, textile, leather, metal wares, among others, boasts of
a great potential, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the successful marketing of Zimbabwean products
on the sub- regional market is not only neccessary for the
increase of the country's foreign exchange earnings, but also for
the enhancement of its industrial competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean exports to the sub-region averages about 1 billion
U.S. dollars and accounts for some 17 percent of the total
intra-regional exports, according to statistics provided by the
bank.

<HEADLINE> Kasyanov Sees Economic Progress in Russia, But Urges for Caution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 42-year-old new head of government, told deputies at the
State Duma before his confirmation that industrial production in
the first four months of this year went up by more than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Kasyanov was confirmed by the State Duma with a vote of 325-55.
Fifteen lawmakers abstained.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in the decade, investments in principal
capital are steadily growing, and they have grown by about 8
percent in the first quarter," Kasyanov said.
</P>
<P>
With the improving fiscal balance, the Russian government no
longer has to resort to massive borrowing for the necessary budget
spending and barter is gradually giving way to normal money
circulation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kasyanov, who has spent 10 years working in the economics and
finance ministries, told the deputies that the country's gold and
currency reserves of the Central Bank have increased by 5 billion
U.S. dollars in the first four months to reach 17.6 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of the Russian ruble has also been firm
lately, but Kasyanov said "the strengthening of the ruble does not
meet interests of the development of the Russian economy at this
stage."
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that the Russian economic recovery was in
part blessed by high world prices of oil, the country's main
export, and the ruble devaluation following the August 1998
financial crisis, which helped domestic producers.
</P>
<P>
Despite increases in people's real incomes in the past few
months, poverty remains the most acute problem, Kasyanov said,
noting that two-thirds of the population live beneath the
subsistence level.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the country's per capita gross domestic
product had decreased by 40 percent in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
In the subsequent questions and answers session, Kasyanov
pledged to exercise more effective supervision on economic
activities, to lend more support for agriculture, to streamline
defense spending and equip the armed forces with more modern
weapons, and to lower tax burdens and simplify the taxation system.

<HEADLINE> French Weekly Publishes Manifesto Against Prostitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The French weekly Le Nouvel
Observateur published in its latest issue Wednesday a manifesto
against prostitution which is signed by 35 French personalities in
political, scientific and artistic circles.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "The Body Is Not Merchandise," the manifesto calls on
France and other European countries to "solemnly affirm their
resolve to fight prostitution."
</P>
<P>
Among the signatories are General Secretary of the French
Socialist Party Francois Hollande, National Secretary of the
French Communist Party Robert Hue, France's representative to the
United Nations Francoise Gaspard, Minister of Environment
Dominique Voynet, and a number of writers, lawyers, scientists and
actors and actresses.
</P>
<P>
They call on the European Union to fight all forms of
prostitution-- those of children or adults, men or women,
inhabitants of developed countries or developing countries.
</P>
<P>
They also called for the launching of a campaign against the
purchase of sexual service by the clients of prostitutes-- who
they said are "unknown accomplices" -- and pimps.
</P>
<P>
"Prostitution is an offense against women and through them
against human being and each of us," they said in the manifesto.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has been hosting since Tuesday a
seminar on prostitution under the theme of "People of Abyss, the
Prostitution of Today."
</P>
<P>
The seminar is sponsored by the Scelles Foundation in
collaboration with a dozen associations which have been
campaigning for the outlawing of pimps, prevention of prostitution,
and helping prostitutes return to normal life.
</P>
<P>
The French publishing house Albin Michel also published this
week a "black book on prostitution."
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China, Denmark to Vie for Uber Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The reigning champions China
will meet Denmark for the first time in the final of Uber Cup
women's team badminton championships following their semifinals
victory on Wednesday at the Putra Stadium here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Both completed the best-of-three ties in three straight games
with China crashing Indonesia 3-0 and Denmark overpowering South
Korea 3-0.
</P>
<P>
World top-ranked player Gong Zhichao was unmatchable both at
the baseline and on the net as she slashed Ellen Angelina 11-2, 11-
1.
</P>
<P>
Ge Fei and Gu Jun, the world best women's doubles pair, kept
the fast rhythm when they sweat little to conquer Eliza Nathanael
and Deyana Lomban 15-9, 15-7 in the first doubles.
</P>
<P>
The tie was actually on the way of no turning back after the
first doubles win as Dai Yun snatched the third game 11-6, 11-4.
</P>
<P>
China's head coach Li Yongbo said, "We'd expected to play
Denmark in the final game even before the start of the competition.
"
</P>
<P>
"Denmark now are better than Indonesia, so it's not a surprise
to counter them in the championship game."
</P>
<P>
Li said the Chinese women's players would try their best to
keep the perfect record in the competition.
</P>
<P>
"The first singles between Gong Zhichao and Camilla Martin is
the most important match, but we'll go all out for a best result."
</P>
<P>
China had never dropped a single game and Dai Yun lost only one
set for China in the past three ties.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time for the Danes to reach the championship
game since 1960 when they lost to the United States 5-2 for the
second straight time in the finals.
</P>
<P>
Denmark's coach Kenneth Larsen said, "This is Denmark's first
finals appearance in 40 years. We're very proud of our success,
and our players delivered great efforts for the win."
</P>
<P>
World champion Camilla Martin kept her sweeping vow by taking
another easy win over Kim Ji Hyun 11-5, 11-7, and Mette Sorensen
put the Danes in driving seat with a critical second-singles
victory over Lee Kyung Won 11-8, 11-3.
</P>
<P>
"We had known before the match that we had the chance to beat
Koreans, but I was not sure about the second singles game. If we
lost, it could be very difficult for others to pull down the win,"
Larsen said.
</P>
<P>
Sorensen, ranked 10th in the world, conquered Lee with powerful
strikes throughout the game, forcing Lee to committing a series of
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
Helene Kirkegaard and Rikke Olsen wrapped up the best-of-five
tie with a 15-5, 15-6, victory over Lee Hyo Jung and Chung Jae Hee.
</P>
<P>
To predict the championship game against China, Larsen said, "
To play China is very tough, but we still have the chance to beat
them."
</P>
<P>
World No. 2 player Camilla Martin said she was confident to
beat world No. 1 player Gong Zhichao of China in the first singles
match of the final, which starts on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The first game against Gong Zhichao will be very difficult
because she is a very good player and played very well in the past
few months.
</P>
<P>
"The first singles game is almost the most important game. I'
ll try my best," Martin said.
</P>
<P>
Last time the world top two singles shuttlers met was in the
Grand Prix Finals in 1999 when Gong had the better of the game.

BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao
and Philippine President Joseph Estrada met here today for
friendly talks.
</P>
<P>
After their discussions, they attended a reception to celebrate
the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties
between China and the Philippines, hosted by the Chinese People's
Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao addressed the reception. Looking back on the history

successful state visit by Chinese President Jiang Zemin to the
Philippines in 1996. During that visit, Jiang and Philippine
leaders reached agreement on strengthening good-neighborly
cooperative relations of mutual trust oriented towards 21st
century, which sets the direction for the long-term development of
the bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Oks Fund Allocation for Northern Developments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli cabinet Wednesday
approved an economic and social development plan worth NIS 1.6
billion (about 0.4 billion U.S. dollars) for Israeli northern
settlements along the border with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference after the special cabinet session, Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak stressed that Kiryat Shemona and other "
confrontation line communities" will receive special attention from
the government in the context of the planned withdrawal of Israeli
troops from south Lebanon by this July.
</P>
<P>
The NIS 1.6 billion funds, Barak said, will be allocated for
creating new jobs in the north, strengthening education and
building additional kindergartens, improving transportation, water
and sewage infrastructure for those settlements.
</P>
<P>
The plan is aimed at stabilizing the situation in the northern
areas and encouraging Israelis from other parts of the country to
move to these communities, according to the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Barak also promised that northern residents will benefit from
housing privileges, with their neighborhoods being renovated and
grounds marked for development being enlarged.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the prime minister told his ministers that the aid
package is a national project to support these communities, and the
plan is a key pillar of the preparations for the withdrawal from
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Yossi Kucik, director-general of the Prime Minister's Office and
Barak's trusted fellow, also reported that the government has
decided to place the needs of the frontline communities at the top
of the national agenda.
</P>
<P>
Although the final size of the aid plan was less than NIS 4
billion originally demanded by the Confrontation Line Communities
Forum, the residents' representative organization welcomed the fund
allocations for 2001-2002 fiscal year in general.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet session was held as the Israel Defense Forces is
stepping up its preparation for the withdrawal form the so-called
security zone in south Lebanon by July, which is approved by the
Israeli cabinet in March.
</P>
<P>
Since then, northern Israelis are worrying for their security,
and arguing that without the buffer zone, which was set up by
Israel in 1985 with a self-claimed aim to prevent cross-border
attacks, the northern settlements will be exposed undefendedly to
Katyusha rocket attacks and terrorist infiltration by Lebanese
Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah and other resistant militia have been fighting
against Israeli occupation in south Lebanon for decades. In early
May, several waves of Katyusha rockets fired by Hezbollah as
retaliation landed in Kiryat Shemona and other northern
settlements, wounding civilians, damaging properties and triggering
fire.
</P>
<P>
Due to the growing pressure against the IDF withdrawal from
northern residents and the political interest groups representing
them, the Barak administration mulled the compensation for the
northern settlements by the means of an aid package in order to
remove the internal obstacle against the pullout.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Iraq Intensifies Anti-Embargo Efforts  by Li Xuejun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Omani products fair, concluded
in the Iraqi capital Baghdad on Tuesday, has served as part of the
intensified efforts by Iraq to resist and break the crippling U.N.
embargo imposed on the country since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The 22 Omani companies taking part in the fair won contracts
worth 40 million U.S. dollars from the Iraqi side under the U.N.
oil-for-food program, an exemption to U.N. sanctions, according to
a report of the official Iraqi News Agency (INA).
</P>
<P>
This is in contrast with the contracts worth just 33 million
dollars Omani companies signed with Iraq under the U.N.
humanitarian deal, which was launched in late 1996 and now in its
seventh phase.
</P>
<P>
While generously signing contracts worth millions of dollars
with Omani companies, Iraq has taken advantage of the fair to show
to the world that how lucrative and important it is to maintain
relations with the country despite of the U.N. embargo.
</P>
<P>
Iraq Gives Trade Priority to Arab Countries
</P>
<P>
To break the U.N. embargo and walk out of isolation in the Arab
world, Iraq has formulated the strategy of focusing its attention
on developing relations with Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has said that Iraq should give
preferential treatments in developing trade ties with Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Oman, following Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon, has made
unexpected gains by holding products exhibitions in Baghdad this
year.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, for example, sealed about 100 million dollars worth of
contracts at the recent Egyptian products fair, at which 100
Egyptian firms displayed their products.
</P>
<P>
The contracts Egypt signed with Iraq under the U.N. oil-for-food
program have amounted to 1 billion dollars since the program was
launched in December 1996, according to Aouni Hashim, director of
the Egyptian Trade Center in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. oil-for-food deal, over half the contracts were
signed with other Arab countries. Iraq has now developed trade
relations with all Gulf states but Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Iraq's highly lucrative market has attracted flocks of
world trade officials and business delegations to Baghdad for trade
talks and deals.
</P>
<P>
By doing so, Iraq hopes to impress the world that the
unprecedented U.N. embargo is getting eroded by itself.
</P>
<P>
Practical Anti-Embargo Measures to be Taken
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz, who chaired the two-day
meeting of the Follow-up and Coordination Committee that ended on
May 9, has called upon Iraq's supporters to take more concrete
anti-embargo measures.
</P>
<P>
A total of 57 representatives from 22 Arab, European, Asian and
Latin American countries attended the meeting, which was aimed at
supporting Iraq and opposing the embargo.
</P>
<P>
Aziz told the participants that it is not enough to express
defiance over the embargo, but more anti-embargo activities are
needed to achieve the aim of ultimately breaking the embargo.
</P>
<P>
Aziz highly appreciated the "courageous initiative" of the
French Priest Jean-Marie Benjamin, along with other three Italians,
who broke the embargo on Iraq last month by taking a direct flight
from Amman, capital of Jordan, to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin and his companions arrived in Baghdad on April 3,
becoming the first group flying to Baghdad without prior U.N.
permission since 1990.
</P>
<P>
In a firm response to Aziz's call, Benjamin declared that he
will organize another flight from Paris to Baghdad by taking a
Boeing passenger plane with some 300 people on board.
</P>
<P>
He was echoed by British Member of Parliament George Galloway,
who announced that he will organize a direct flight from London to
Baghdad to challenge the embargo.
</P>
<P>
The Russian State Duma (Parliament) delegation attending the
meeting has also reportedly expressed the desire to arrange flights
to Baghdad to protest the U.N. air ban.
</P>
<P>
Iraq hopes that by taking such measures, its supporters will be
able to stir up a worldwide campaign of supporting Iraq and
opposing the "genocidal" embargo, which has killed over 1.2 million
people, mostly children and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
Embargo Regime Begins to Corrode
</P>
<P>
The decision by Iraq to intensify its anti-embargo efforts came
amid an international situation advantageous to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Russia, China and France, all permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council, have been calling for lifting the sanctions on
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iraq has mended fences with most Arab countries. On
April 20, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) reopened its embassy in
Baghdad, marking a full recovery of their bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
So far, four of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member
states -- UAE, Bahrain, Oman and Qatar -- have renewed diplomatic
ties with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has opened an interests section in Syria, the first formal
diplomatic link between the two countries in almost 20 years. Syria
is expected to follow suit shortly.
</P>
<P>
Syria-influenced Lebanon restored diplomatic relations with Iraq
in October 1998, after a four-year break.
</P>
<P>
There has been a thaw in relations between Iraq and its
traditional rival Saudi Arabia, a close American ally. In August
last year, Saudi Arabia released 1 million dollars worth of Iraqi
assets frozen in Saudi banks.
</P>
<P>
It is no wonder that Iraqi leaders, including President Saddam
Hussein, have declared that the U.N. embargo on Iraq is starting to
corrode thanks to "the great fortitude and endurance" of the Iraqi
people.
</P>
<P>
Even so, Iraq is still facing a lengthy and uphill struggle in
breaking the sweeping embargo, due to the vehement opposition and
powerful pressure from the U.S. and its Western allies.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Iraq is taking the risks of straining or even
worsening its relations with the U.N. by planing to take more
measures to challenge the world's leading body.

<HEADLINE> Manila Adopts New Agenda to Address Mindanao Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Vice-President Gloria
Macapagal-Arroyo said Wednesday that the government is pursuing a
four-point agenda to address the Mindanao armed conflict that
would ensure the security and protection of the people.
</P>
<P>
Arroyo told reporters that initially, the government shall
continue to pursue peace negotiations with the separatist Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) within the framework of the
constitution and the concept of meaningful autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, she said, the government shall preserve the
territorial integrity and protect the civilians "through effective
military and police actions in cases of ceasefire violations or
illegal acts perpetrated by the MILF and other rebel groups."
</P>
<P>
The vice-president noted that the government's agenda shall
also vigorously focus in the pursuance of the socio-economic
development programs in Muslim areas in Mindanao including those
in the MILF area of influence.
</P>
<P>
Lastly, Arroyo said the government shall continue with full and
effective implementation of the peace agreement signed with
another Muslim group, Moro National Liberation Front, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Arroyo said this will show the government's sincerity and
goodwill to resolve the Mindanao problem politically.
</P>
<P>
Before he left for his state visit to China, Philippine
President Joseph Estrada designated Arroyo to act for him and on
his behalf during his absence.

<HEADLINE> Donors Warn Afghan Groups Against Fresh Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Expressing alarm at reports of
eruption of fighting, donors to Afghanistan have warned the
warring factions that hostilities could endanger efforts to
generate additional aid for the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
In a demarche to the Afghan authorities, the Afghan Support
Group (ASG) said that aid to Afghanistan could stop if fighting
breaks out. Text of the letter was issued to the press by the
United Nations office in Islamabad on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The resumption of large scale hostilities by the warring
parties will jeopardize efforts to generate additional aid for
Afghanistan, as well as the prospects of future rehabilitation and
development assistance," said the letter.
</P>
<P>
The warning came as the ruling Taliban militia and the
opposition northern alliance are engaged in heavy fighting at the
advent of summer, when the snow-clogged mountain passes open up.
</P>
<P>
The ASG letter called for allowing the United Nations and non-
governmental agencies providing assistance to civilians affected
by war or drought to operate according to the international-
recognized principles of neutrality, impartiality and independence.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has found it increasingly difficult to get
international aid for Afghanistan. In the last two years, the
world body has been able to get less than 50 percent of the money
it requested.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Reindeer Faces Extinction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, May 16 (Xinhua) -- An investigation by a rare animal
survey team shows that wild reindeer have nearly disappeared in
China and the animal will become extinct if protection efforts
fail.
</P>
<P>
There are only 780 reindeer left in zoos and feedlots, and that
number has been dropping, according to the team's survey report.
</P>
<P>
The reindeer is an auspicious animal in Chinese culture, and
many temple and palace statues were built in its image. The
philosopher Confucius referred to the reindeer as a "benevolent
beast" in his famous history book "The Spring and Autumn" written
in 481 B.C.
</P>
<P>
Reindeer lived throughout China in ancient times, but now they
are mainly reared by an ethnic minority tribe in the forest region
in northeast China. The hunting tribe has been supporting its
members by selling reindeer skin and meat.
</P>
<P>
As more and more young tribe members are moving to cities,
reindeer are not as useful as before.
</P>
<P>
Kong Fanzhi, an anthropologist, said that reindeer will
disappear together with the primitive culture.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has put the animal on its state
protection list.

<HEADLINE> China Opens Military Port to International Shipping (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Huludao port was first approved for opening in 1984 to domestic
commercial shipping lines, and has since mainly handled crude oil,
oil products, grain and building materials destined for the nation
's leading commercial ports in Shanghai and Fujian Province in
east China and Guangdong Province in south China.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that the opening of the Huludao port to
international shipping use could greatly boost the economy in the
western part of Liaoning, and it may also facilitate the
transportation of commodities, grain in particular, from the three
northeastern provinces and east parts of Inner Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
"If the Huludao port could be merged with nearby Jinzhou Port,
whose current handling capacity stands at between six and seven
million tons, shipping would be greatly enhanced and the economy
around the Bohai Rim would receive a strong boost," said Ren Hong,
a port planning official with the State Development Planning
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Huludao has been a military port since 1908. It was later
expanded in 1929 by General Zhang Xueliang. After Japanese
invasion into northeast China in 1931, it was used by the Japanese
army as a transportation base.
</P>
<P>
The ice-free port now has an annual commercial handling
capacity of one million tons. The city government is still moving
to expand it, with investment totaling 280 million yuan earmarked
for the first phase. One dock, with a handling capacity of 10,000
tons, has already been completed, while two others -- of 20,000
dwt and 35,000 dwt capacity, respectively, are now under
construction. Another six docks will be built under the second-
phase expansion project, at a cost of one billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> China Opens Military Port to International Shipping (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 17 (Xinhua) -- China opened one of its leading
military ports, Huludao, in northeastern China's Liaoning Province
today to international commercial shipping.
</P>
<P>
Located on the Bohai Rim, Huludao is an important port for the
Chinese navy.
</P>
<P>
With the opening of the port, domestic freighters will be able
to engage in foreign trade by transporting cargo to any foreign
country in the world. Prior to the port opening, for the past 20
years, it was restricted to domestic shipping.
</P>
<P>
"Introducing international shipping to Huludao port indicates
that China always considers economic development as a first
priority, and ports with military facilities can be partly put
into civil use to spur regional economies," said Chen Zhengcai, a
navigation official with the Ministry of Communications.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has given the green light for opening of the
port. A customs office, a border control office, and the
administrative body for entry-exit inspections and quarantine has
been established.
</P>
<P>
"Huludao port cannot match other ports in cargo-handling
capacity, but its opening is an indication that China will
continue to open its ports to the world," Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Uncovers Big Cigarette Smuggling Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Police in Beijing this morning
uncovered a case involving 70,000 cartons of smuggled cigarettes
worth over two million yuan (about 240,000 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
With cooperation from the local Tobacco Monopoly Bureau,
police arrested four men suspected of smuggling the 70,000 cartons
from coastal areas in east China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
The smuggled cigarettes included 30,000 cartons of "555" and
40,000 cartons of "Hilton," sources with Beijing Tobacco Monopoly
Bureau said.
</P>
<P>
They said local police and the bureau joined hands recently to
cracking down on the rampant selling of smuggled cigarette and the
rising number of these cases in the city.
</P>
<P>
Usually, a carton of "555" cigarettes sells for about 120 yuan
( about 14.4 dollars), but a carton of smuggled ones sells for
about 40 yuan (4.8 dollars).
</P>
<P>
While a carton of "Hilton" cigarettes sells for about 70 yuan (
8.4 dollars) on the regular Chinese market, it sells for only
about 30 yuan (3.6 dollars) on the black market.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- China's 50 million mobile phone
users increased the country's phone telecom business volume above
that of fixed phone services for the first time in the first
quarter this year, the Ministry of Information Industry said today.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March, the country's mobile network was listed
the third in the world, covering more than 93 percent of counties
in China, according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Chunjiang, Vice-Minister of the Information Industry,
said at a seminar here today, which marks the World
Telecommunication Day with the theme of "Mobile Communication",
that the mobile communication will continue to maintain a rapid
growth in coming years.
</P>
<P>
"In the near future, mobile phone subscribers will surpass
fixed phone users and new services on the basis of mobile telecom
technology will occur such as mobile data, mobile Internet and
mobile multi-media services," said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Su Jinsheng, director of the telecommunication management
department under the ministry, attributed the rapid development of
the mobile industry in the past years to the introduction of high

<HEADLINE> No Way Out for "Lee Teng-hui Path": Commentary (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- China's Xinhua news agency released
a commentary today, stressing that there will be no way out for
the so-called "Lee Teng-hui path" in the island of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says that it has aroused the attention of the
general public whether the new leaders of Taiwan accept the one
China principle and dispel people's doubts or they inherit Lee's
mantle and prolong the "Lee Teng-hui path."
</P>
<P>
The so-called path of Lee Teng-hui means that Lee has
suppressed forces on the island that are in favor of reunification
while fostering separatist forces and separatist thinking.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-Straits relations, Lee deviated step by step from
the one China principle, deterred and undermined the growth of
cross-Straits ties and created regional tension.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Lee engaged himself in a host of activities to
actively promote "two Chinas", "one China, one Taiwan" to the rest
of the world and tried all means to purchase advanced weapons in
an attempt to confront the motherland.
</P>
<P>
In a nutshell, the so-called "Lee Teng-hui path" represents a
separatist path that continuously betrayed and negated the one
China principle, the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
When he first took office, Lee often talked about "one China"
so as to consolidate his new power in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In his first meeting with the press in February 1988 after
taking office, Lee vowed that there was only the policy of one
China instead of the policy of two Chinas. There is only one China
and the two sides of the Taiwan Straits must reunite, he said.
</P>
<P>
Later, in October 1990, Lee once again said publicly that there
was only one China, which should and must reunite, and that every
Chinese should be responsible for reuniting the country.

<HEADLINE> No Way Out for "Lee Teng-hui Path": Commentary (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
However, Lee's true face began to be exposed with the gradual
consolidation of his power. He started to negate the one China
principle and uttered one after another separatist remarks such as
the "one country, two governments", "parallel political entities"
and the infamous "two states" remarks.
</P>
<P>
Lee went even further to suggest a coordinated attack on China
with foreign forces, straining even further cross-Straits
relations.
</P>
<P>
The commentary stresses that the basis and prerequisite for
stabilizing and developing cross-Straits relations lies in
recognizing the fact that there is one China, Taiwan is a part of
China and China's sovereignty and territorial integrity can not be
split.
</P>
<P>
Any Chinese with intuitive knowledge will not waiver on such an
important issue, and any word or deed that deviates from and
negate the one China principle will not be accepted or tolerated
by the Chinese people, the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
The "two states" remarks of Lee were later spurned by the
Chinese at home and abroad and Lee himself was deemed by the
international community as "the troublemaker".
</P>
<P>
In the island, Lee's perverse acts have aroused the great
indignation of the Taiwan people, and he was forced to step down
much earlier from the post of chairman of the Kuomintang.
</P>
<P>
The commentary notes that when Lee first put forward his
remarks of "two states", some people already pointed out that his
move was designed to influence the island's post-election mainland
policy so that his path would remain even when he was gone.

<P>
Actually, the specter of Lee's path still looms large in Taiwan.
Some Taiwan independent advocates are trying to avoid being clear
on the one China principle. Others are attempting to drag foreign
forces into the internal affairs of China.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says that during his dictatorship of Taiwan, Lee
had given full play to his self-made role as a sinister politician
and hypocrite. His gestures concerning the one China principle
were made only to conform to specific situations.
</P>
<P>
Today, some people in Taiwan are talking about easing cross-
Straits relations and improving relations with the motherland, but
only for the purpose of consolidating their political power in the
island, the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
It points out that the key to improved cross-Straits relations
lies in the upholding of the one China policy. "It does not mean
much to utter only a few kind words while refusing to recognize
the one China principle and Taiwan as part of China," it says.
</P>
<P>
During his rule, Lee Teng-hui tried all he could to promote to
the international community "two Chinas", "one China, one Taiwan".
However, Lee failed. Though he wanted to prevent the cross-Straits
relations from developing, Lee received no support from the people
of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The commentary notes that the so-called "Lee Teng-hui path" has
already been proved to be a dead end.
</P>
<P>
If some people still hope to continuously push forward Lee's
path in Taiwan, they are destined to come to a more disgraceful
end.

<HEADLINE> Bill on Jerusalem Boundary Wins Preliminary Endorsement in Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Knesset (parliament)
Wednesday gave preliminary endorsement to a bill restricting
changes to the municipal boundaries of Jerusalem and prohibiting
the transfer of power to another authority.
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of a stormy debate, the bill passed its
preliminary reading by a vote of 68-21. Many coalition members were
among those who voted in favor.
</P>
<P>
The bill, sponsored by the opposition Likud Knesset member
(MP) ,Yehoshua Matza, is intended to serve as an amendment to Basic
Law which defines Jerusalem as the capital and calls for
safeguarding the current Jerusalem city limits.
</P>
<P>
However, it still remains to be seen whether the bill can pass
other readings in the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the Likud bill, Meretz MP Mussi Raz has proposed a
bill calling for removing 18 Arab villages from the Jerusalem
limits. The move, however, has drawn criticism from both within and
outside the government coalition.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet and Knesset on Monday endorsed Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's plan to transfer three villages on the
outskirts of Jerusalem, Abu Dis, Azariya and Swahara, now under
Israeli security and Palestinian civilian control to full
Palestinian control. The move, intended as a confidence-building
measure, has met strong opposition from the Likud party.

<P>
CANBERRA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Susan O'Neill shattered the oldest
world swimming record of women's 200 meters butterfly at the
Australian national swimming championships in Sydney on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
O'Neill, the reigning world and Olympic champion, clocked two
minutes 5.81 seconds, trimming 0.15 seconds off the previous
record of 2:05.96 set by Mary T. Meagher way back on August 13,
1981, in Brown Deer, Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
O'Neill, 26, has spent most of the past decade chasing Meagher'
s legendary mark. Already the second-fastest woman in history, she
set a personal best of 2:06.51 in Tuesday's semifinals but once
again came up agonisingly short.
</P>
<P>
"I felt really good during the whole race. I felt really strong,
" O'Neill said. "I'd like to think I can go faster than that.
Maybe now that it's it off my back I can go even better but the
big one's in September."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Grain Producer Attracts Overseas Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, May 17 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province, a major
grain producer, saw a surge in overseas investment in the first
three months this year.
</P>
<P>
Official figures indicate that the province approved 48
overseas-funded enterprises in the quarter, with a total
contractual overseas investment of 140 million U.S. dollars, an
increase of 176 percent on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
These projects involve such areas as agriculture, machinery,
telecommunications and power.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Anhui Provincial Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation Commission attributed the growth to an
improving business environment in the province.
</P>
<P>
Anhui has issued a series of new policies to attract business
people from abroad since last year, including measures to protect
the legitimate rights and interests of overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Special centers have been established across the province to
deal with complaints from overseas investors.

<HEADLINE> China Expects Investment Boom from EU Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- China is expecting to see booming
investment from enterprises in European Union (EU) countries, the
medium- and small-sized but high-tech ventures in particular.
</P>
<P>
The prediction is evidenced from a recent special forum held by
the Chinese government focusing on closer cooperation between
Chinese and EU small enterprises, at which a list of 300 projects
have been announced calling for joint development with the EU
firms.
</P>
<P>
The second largest economic power in the world as it is, EU
accounts for only 6 percent in the total foreign investment in
China. Economists said that Sino-EU cooperation in business
should prioritize medium- and small-sized firms since such firms
comprise a dominant part in both EU and China economies.
</P>
<P>
Medium- and small-sized firms account for 99.2 percent in EU
countries, and the proportion of such firms in China stands at 99
percent.
</P>
<P>
"Small enterprises could become the most vigorous force in
tightening Sino-Eu business cooperation in the future given the
huge potential such EU firms have in exploring the Chinese market,
" an economist attending the forum said, adding that the
impending entry of China into the World Trade Organization (WTO)
could also serve as a boost to closer Sino-EU cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Stop Tax Advantages to Offshore Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has informed the OSCE (the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe) that it will
scrap all tax advantages to offshore companies by the end of 2005.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken after the Cyprus government got initial
assurances from the OSCE that it will not be included on the "black
list" of tax heavens and consequently will not be liable to
sanctions, the Financial Weekly reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Cyprus' Finance Minister Takis Clerides as
saying that the move is also in line with the island's EU (European
Union) harmonization efforts.
</P>
<P>
The offshore companies in Cyprus now are taxed at the
preferential rate of 4.25 percent on net profits compared to 20
percent for local companies.
</P>
<P>
Clerides acknowledged that the decision will have a serious
impact on the operation of the offshore companies operating on the
island, but said the Cyprus government has no other choice but to
comply rather than risk a clash with the OSCE and complicate the EU
accession talks.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus started substantive membership talks with the EU in 1998.
It hopes to be admitted as an EU member by January 2003.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Negotiators to Resume Talks in Stockholm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators will continue their "back-channel" talks Thursday in
Stockholm despite controversies arising from the recent disclosure
of the channel, the Israeli daily Ha'aretz reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami and attorney
Gilad Sher, and Palestinian Legislative Council Speaker Ahmed Qurei
will head their respective negotiation teams to the talks.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Middle East special envoy Dennis Ross is also taking part
in the talks. He is scheduled to report to U.S. President Bill
Clinton later this week on the developments in the talks.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which have been going on secretly for months, were
made public last week, triggering strong reactions from the chief
negotiators who are trying to reach an overdue framework agreement
on the final-status issues through official talks.
</P>
<P>
Yasser Abed Rabbo, head of the Palestinian negotiating team,
resigned on Monday in protest against the secret channel in Sweden,
saying that it will weaken their negotiating positions.
</P>
<P>
Oded Eran, Israeli chief negotiator, was also frustrated by his
lack of authority.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the official negotiations halted on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Rabbo's resignation, however, has been rejected by Palestinian
National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat. He is expected to
withdraw the resignation after being explained the reasons for the
use of the Swedish channel.
</P>
<P>
The back-channel talks, reminiscent of those in Oslo, Norway
seven years ago which produced the first peace deals between the
two sides, were said to be making progress.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami said upon his return to Israel on Tuesday that the "
secret" negotiations in Stockholm were aimed primarily at preparing
for a three-way summit between Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Clinton sometime this summer and denied that Eran was
being bypassed.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a negotiation aimed at finishing the permanent
status agreement," Ben-Ami said in an interview with Israel TV
Channel One. " We work under the assumption that it will be
difficult to reach agreement on all issues, and that first of all
it is necessary to create the conditions which will let the leaders
bridge the gaps."
</P>
<P>
He added that the timetable is tight due to the upcoming U.S.
elections and the Israeli government is hoping to hold "intensive
talks" in Washington within a month or two. He noted that it is
still possible to clinch a deal by September.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian negotiators were to have reached a
framework agreement by May 13 but missed the deadline due to the
stagnancy in the talks.
</P>
<P>
U.S. National Security Advisor Sandy Berger is expected in
Israel on Friday and will also meet with the leaders in order to

International Monetary Fund (IMF) signed here Wednesday a
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies or better known

<P>
With the signing of the LoI, the Fund is expected to soon
disburse its package loan worth 400 million U.S. dollars to
Indonesia.

<P>
The Indonesian government was represented by Coordinating
Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry, Kwik Kian Gie,
Minister of Finance,Bambang Sudibyo, and Governor of the Central
Bank, Syahril Sabirin.While the Fund was represented by Joshua
Felman, Chairman of the IMF Economic Review Team in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"This step is freighted with meaning. It means that the
government has achieved the first major milestone in its economic
reform effort.And it means that the government and the IMF have
agreed on a strong plan for carrying these reforms forward over
the coming months," Kwik Kian Gie told a press conference after
the signing.
</P>
<P>
Initially, the LoI was expected to be signed last month but was
suspended due the failure of the Indonesian government in
implementing some points of economic reforms program contained in
the last agreement.
</P>
<P>
"It also means that this plan is now ready to be presented to
the IMF Executive Board, paving the way for a new disbursement in
early June, of around 400 million U.S. dollars, from the 5 billion
U.S.dollars arrangement with the Fund," Kwik Kian Gie added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Joshua Felman said that : "We reach this agreement
today because the IMF sees the Indonesia's economy is getting
better."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, he confirmed that "a new disbursement of
the loan package may be done two weeks from now on or early of
June."
</P>
<P>
He, however, did not mention how much will be disburst by the
Fund, saying that the signing of the LoI is a very significant
step made by the Indonesian government on its economic reforms
program.
</P>
<P>
"And it is expected that the new agreement will bring a
positive impact for the strengthening of the rupiah."
</P>
<P>
The new LoI contains four main agenda for the next Indonesia's
economic reform program, namely macroeconomic policies, structural
fiscal reforms, banking system reforms, and reform of state-owned
enterprises and other key structural reforms.

<HEADLINE> German President Visits Switzerland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- German President Johannes Rau
arrived in the Swiss city of Zurich Wednesday to start a three-day
visit to Switzerland, according to Swiss Radio International.
</P>
<P>
It is Rau's first state visit to Switzerland, although he was
amongst the participants of the economic forum in Davos earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
Rau and his entourage was received in Zurich by Swiss President
Adolf Ogi and Foreign Minister Joseph Deiss. The party will then
travel to the Swiss capital of Berne for formal talks on Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The talks are expected to focus on bilateral relations,
cultural exchanges and the role of Europe. Accounting for 31
percent of all Swiss imports and 23 percent of exports, Germany is
by far Switzerland's largest trading partner.
</P>
<P>
The German president's trip is considered as an opportunity for
both governments to stress the continued importance of ties
between the two countries. As a tradition, every German president
has paid at least one official visit to Switzerland since the
founding of the federal republic.

<HEADLINE> Russian State Duma Confirms Kasyanov as New Premier (Update with details, background) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma on Wednesday
confirmed Mikhail Kasyanov as the country's new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old economist expert cleared the lower house of
parliament by a vote of 325-55 with 15 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the Duma deputies, Kasyanov promised to
exercise "effective control" over the monopolies of natural
resources to ease tax burdens, simplify taxation system and equip
the armed forces with modern hardware.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the creation of an efficient civil service
system and the reorganization of the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
Kasyanov, who was finance minister in the previous cabinet, is
a familiar face in the West as the government's top debt
negotiator.
</P>
<P>
The Russian media said that Kasyanov would make "an obedient
and industrious prime minister without any evident political
ambitions."
</P>
<P>
As first deputy prime minister since January, he has been in
charge of day-to-day running of the government and President
Vladimir Putin is likely to keep him in that role - primarily as a
manager rather than a policy-maker.
</P>
<P>
Kasyanov has spent 10 years in the economics and finance
ministries, but has little experience in other spheres of politics.
</P>
<P>
Born on December 8, 1957, Kasyanov is a fluent English-speaker.
He graduated from Moscow's Automobile and Road Institute, and
later worked at Gosplan, the Soviet Union's powerful economic
planning agency.
</P>
<P>
With Kasyanov confirmed, people's attention will now shift to
the formation of the new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Russian media speculated that Putin would prefer stability and
keep many of the ministers.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency, quoting government sources, said
Putin will meet Kasyanov later Wednesday and possibly decide on
the first cabinet appointments.

<HEADLINE> Safety of Hostages Is Our Primary Concern, Says Philippine President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
closely following the hostage situation and its primary concern is
the safety of the hostages, Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a press conference here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada said that he is now maintaining contacts with
the military and officials concerned, and he can send instructions
to them any time.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Domingo Siazon told the
reporters that the Philippine government is aware of the
importance of human lives, and has taken into account the concerns
of the governments of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
"We have purposely kept the military a good distance from the
kidnappers," he said, noting that there would be no military
operations unless the kidnappers start hurting the hostages.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government is aiming for the release of the
hostages through negotiations, and will continue to supply
medicine and food for the hostages, but such supply will depend on
approval by the kidnappers, he said.
</P>
<P>
On April 23, Abu Sayyaf extremists kidnapped 21 people, mostly
foreigners, from a Malaysian diving resort and took them to Sulu
Province of the Philippines.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading Egyptian newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Al Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt and Libya on Tuesday signed a memo of understanding
under which Egypt will provide Libya with 150,000 tons of rice
annually in the coming three years. The trade volume between Egypt
and Libya amounted to 328.6 million Egyptian pounds (94.7 million
U.S. dollars) in 1999. Libya is Egypt's third largest trading
partner in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- A document released by the Federal Aviation Agency late
Tuesday showed there is no evidence supporting claims that the ill-
fated EgyptAir Flight 990 was deliberately downed by Egyptian pilot
Gameel el-Battouti. The jumbo jet plunged into the Atlantic Ocean
off U.S. eastern coast on October 31, 1999, killing all 270
passengers on board.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt will soon hold trade promotion weeks in Turkey, UAE,
Brazil and Romania, a senior economic source said Tuesday. The
organization of these exhibitions is part of the plan of the
Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade to promote Egyptian goods and
services so as to increase exports and make barter trade deals,
said the source.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on Tuesday left for
Mauritius with a high-level delegation to participate in the 5th
COMESA summit meeting which opens Wednesday in Port Louis.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said he would hold a flurry of meetings with the
participants in the summit to discuss closer coordination among
members of the organization.

<HEADLINE> Manila Wants Collective Decision From Abu Sayyaf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Presidential Flagship Projects Committee Chairman Robert
Aventajado, who is also the head of the new government negotiating
team, said the hostage takers must make their collective demands
in written form.
</P>
<P>
"We need a collective decision. We want to make sure the
demands come from them and not from a third party," Aventajado
said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado, who was named chief negotiator by President Joseph
Estrada on Monday, said the government panel under him will remain
calm and collected as it prepares to negotiate for the hostages'
safe release.
</P>
<P>
The chief negotiator also stressed that the pressure is now on
the extremist Abu Sayyaf to show its humanity by releasing their
hostages,especially the ailing ones.
</P>
<P>
"Now is their chance to show the world the stuff they are made
of.The world is watching them and their thinking process. By their
actions they will betray themselves as either a thinking
organization or a mindless one," Aventajado said.
</P>
<P>
He also persuaded the hostage takers anew to release first
ailing German national Renate Wallert as a gesture of goodwill.
</P>
<P>
The 21 hostages taken by the Abu Sayyaf from a Malaysian diving
resort consist of two South Africans, two Finns, a Lebanese, three
Germans, Two French citizens, nine Malaysians and two Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado and his negotiating team were to fly to Sulu
province Tuesday afternoon for the start of the formal talks but
the bad weather had prevented the team from leaving Manila. He
said the formal talks are expected to start on Thursday or Friday.

<HEADLINE> Uganda, Rwanda to Punish Officers Responsible for Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
and his Rwandan counterpart Paul kagame agreed to punish Ugandan
and Rwandan officers responsible for fomenting the crisis between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Monitor daily reported Wednesday that the two presidents
reached the agreement in their closed-door Sunday summit in
Mwanza town of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"They isolated those individuals who are brewing trouble. There
should be lots of changes in the coming days," a U.N. IRIN news
service report was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Uganda People's Defence Forces (UPDF) and the Rwandan Patriotic
Army (RPA) clashed in Kisangani on May 5and 8, the second
following the first bloody fighting last August.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the recent clashes, the two sides launched verbal
attacks against each other. Rwanda has bitterly attacked UPDF's
Chief of Staff James Kazini, who was also at the center of the
row in the first Kisangani clash.
</P>
<P>
Uganda accused Rwanda's Col Patrick Nyanvumba and Col. James
Kabareebe of masterminding the first attacks in Kisangani. They
were removed from DRC under the terms of the "Mweya cease-fire"
agreed upon between Museveni and Kagame last year.

Mbaabu said that his Ugandan counterparts found most of the
guns in a pit in a forest, and four Ugandan suspects were also

<HEADLINE> Donors Halt Talks on Uganda's Debt Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Donors have halted final discussion
on Uganda's debt relief for a month after recent clashes between
Uganda and Rwanda in Kisangani, a northeast city of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The donors, who were meeting in Kampala for two days to review
Uganda's mid-term budget expenditure, confirmed their
contributions to Uganda of up to 2.4 billion U.S. dollars for the
next three years.
</P>
<P>
"Implementation of the debt relief program has been delayed for
a while. May be a month. A third party said It has something to
do with the clashes between Uganda and Rwanda in the DRC, but I
cannot confirm it," Robert Blake, a senior World Bank resident
economist in Kampala, told Xinhua Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The immediate financial impact on Uganda will be 'zero', but
it is obviously to send a signal of some kind," Blake said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a bad sign that they have postponed it. I suppose they
are concerned about the events in Kisangani," a New Vision report
quoted Emmanuel Tumusiime Mutebile, Secretary to the Treasury of
Uganda, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan and Rwandan troops clashed on May 5 and 8 in Kisangani
where they have armies stationed to back rival rebel factions
fighting against the DRC President laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the two neighboring countries have so far agreed
to demilitarize the Kisangani city, and troops will withdraw 100
kilometers outside of the city center.

<P>
MOSCOW, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Federation Council on
Wednesday approved Vladimir Ustinov as the country's new
prosecutor general by a vote of 114-10 with nine abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Ustinov, until now the acting prosecutor general, replaces Yury
Skuratov, who was suspended by former President Boris Yeltsin in
relation to a criminal case.
</P>
<P>
Addressing members of the upper house of parliament, Ustinov
pledged to continue "the investigation into high-profile crimes...
to the end."
</P>
<P>
"No one will escape punishment. We will carry all of the
corruption cases through to the end," the Interfax news agency
quoted Ustinov as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that an interdepartmental investigation group has been
set up to make the struggle against corruption more effective, and
that top officials of the Prosecutor General's Office have been
instructed to visit the scenes of serious crimes.

However, he complained of the sluggishness and the
politicization of the probes.

<P>
"The investigation mechanism is working too slowly and the
investigation process is extremely politicized," Ustinov said.
</P>
<P>
"Many investigators give interviews and the prosecutor's
agencies are overly politicized. We will not allow the law
enforcement bodies to turn into political organs," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Expects to Have Over 1,000 Cities By 2015 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- China expects to see fast
urbanization in the next 15 years, with the number of cities
forecast to rise to more than 1,000 by 2015.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official with the Ministry of
Construction, China will have an urban development rate of around
50 percent and a total urban population of 600 million by 2015.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the process of the fast-growing urbanization,
China will strictly control the number and scale of large and
extra-large cities and giving greater room to medium-sized and
small cities as well as small rural towns.
</P>
<P>
China has so far developed 668 cities. Most of these cities are
concentrated in the Yangtze and Pearl River deltas, as well as on
the eastern Liaoning Peninsula and in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan
area. Some 200 medium-sized cities have been developed on the
basis of fast-growing towns.
</P>
<P>
The official said that rapid urbanization has improved the
uneven distribution of cities across eastern and western China.
The east is home to 44 percent of cities and the west 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
He added that the country spends 140 billion yuan annually on
the development of urban infrastructure facilities. Most of the
funds come from various localities and non-government
organizations.

<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC), met
with Philippine President Joseph Ejercito Estrada here today.
</P>
<P>

witnessed rapid growth with cooperation continuously increasing in
all fields, he noted.

</P>
<P>

economic development in recent years, it is still a developing
country that is earnestly in need of a long-term peaceful and
stable international environment.
</P>

China will not pose any threat to any other country. On the

relations with its neighbors, he said, expressing the conviction
that China's development will bring about broad prospects for
economic and trade cooperation between China and all world
countries.

<HEADLINE> Air-Borne Dust Not Come from Desert: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Deserts are not the source for sand
and dust storms which attacked Beijing and other areas in north
China this spring, according to a latest survey by experts from
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
Degraded pasture land and dry land around some deserts in the
Inner Mongolia and arable lands which are laid idle in areas
northwest of Beijing are the real sources for air-borne dust,
experts told a symposium held by the CAS in Beijing recently.
</P>
<P>
They said that sand storms which affected north China in spring
originated from 250,000 sq. km of deserted land in middle and west
Inner Mongolia and in northwest Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
Samples of air-borne dust in Beijing showed that 80 percent of
the dust is surface soil or sandy soil, rather than real sand.
</P>
<P>
Experts explained that sand cannot be carried by wind to
faraway places, but small sand or soil can be blown to areas more
than 1,000 kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
The major cause for the desertification of land is estrepement,
denudation and overuse of pasture land and water resources,
experts said. The serious drought in north China this spring and
bad weather caused by the La Nina phenomenon are also responsible
for the frequent sand storms.
</P>
<P>
Experts suggested that effective measures should be taken to
reclaim the degraded pasture and arable land in north China and
plant more trees around cities in the suburbs.

<HEADLINE> Party Pays Attention to Religious Work: Official (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1991, Jiang put forward a principle governing the CPC's
relations with religious friends, that is, the two sides should
unite and cooperate politically and mutually respect each other's
beliefs. The principle has won wholehearted support from religious
personages and the religious believers, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the party has enhanced the management of China's
religious affairs and has properly dealt with religious problems
as they arise.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council
jointly issued a circular on better religious work.
</P>
<P>
Three years later, the central government promulgated the
Regulations on the Administration of Sites for Religious
Activities and the Provisions on the Administration of Religious
Activities of Aliens Within The territory of The People's Republic
of China.
</P>
<P>
The provisions marked an important step in China's rule of law
and its religious affairs work, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party also stressed the importance of respecting
the religious beliefs of ethnic nationalities, resolutely checking
and opposing separatist activities by hostile forces under the
pretext of religion, and maintaining the social stability at
border regions.
</P>
<P>
In the process, exchange activities between China's religious
circles and their foreign counterparts have been encouraged, while
efforts been taken to prevent the infiltration of hostile forces,
Ye said.
</P>
<P>
In the article, the official also talked about the CPC's basic
religious policies in the initial stage of socialism and the
aspects that command further attention and more efforts from

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The "secret" Israeli-Palestinian negotiations in Stockholm
are aimed primarily at preparing the ground for a three-way summit
of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, and U.S. President Bill Clinton sometime this summer.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Minister of Public Security Shlomo Ben-Ami revealed the
news on his return Tuesday from Sweden, where he was leading the
Israeli negotiating team.
</P>
<P>
This second channel, which has been active for some time but was
made public only last week, consists of Ben-Ami and attorney Gilad
Sher on the Israeli side and top negotiators Ahmed Qurei (Abu Ala)
and Hassan Asfour on the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Relative calm returned to the West Bank Tuesday after
Palestinian police began restraining demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Palestinians nonetheless clashed with Israeli
soldiers, but unlike the rioting on Monday, there were no exchanges
of fire, even though Israeli soldiers did fire metal-jacketed
rubber-coated bullets at some flash points.
</P>
<P>
Despite the relative calm, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) sources
say they expect at the very least a continuation of violent
demonstrations in the coming days, even though the climax of
rioting marking Palestinian Naqba Day is past.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Two Israeli civilians were lightly wounded in long-range
Hezbollah attacks on an IDF border outpost in Western Galilee
Tuesday night, and a soldier of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army
was assassinated at his home in the security zone.
</P>
<P>
The two civilians were slightly hurt by shrapnel when rounds
struck the Livneh outpost on the border as they were driving past
in their car. They are apparently workers on the site, which is
being reconstructed inside Israeli territory in preparation for the
IDF's withdrawal from the security zone.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas claimed responsibility
for killing Azar Shaklah, a former SLA soldier, after a squad of
its gunmen infiltrated Markabeh village in the eastern sector of
the zone, less than two kilometers from the Israeli border, and
carried out the "death sentence" for collaborating with Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos planned to meet with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat for a "spiritual visit" in
Bethlehem Wednesday night instead of with Palestinian officials in
Ramallah Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The official reason for the change was that the Palestinians
could not guarantee Stephanopoulos's security in the current
atmosphere of rioting.
</P>
<P>
However, both Israeli and Greek diplomats said the real reason
for the change was Stephanopoulos's refusal to meet with the
Palestinians in Jerusalem, as the latter had wished.

plain suit, instead of a tailcoat.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want ostentation," he said to his aides before the
ceremony on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
His official car stopped at all the red traffic lights as he
came to Cankaya while there was no escort, no siren along the road

</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) George Robertson asked Turkey to send more soldiers to
Kosovo for peacekeeping mission on Tuesday.
</P>

stabilization in Kosovo," said Robertson at the West European Union
meeting in Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- Carlo Cottarelli, the director of Turkish affairs in the

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines posted a trade
surplus of 732 million U.S. dollars for the first quarter of 2000,
which is 35.6 percent higher than the 540 million dollars in the
same period of 1999, the National Statistics Office said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the office, total trade in goods from January to
March 2000 amounted to 16.483 billion dollars which was higher by
8.7 percent over 15.165 billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Of the total trade, imports for the first quarter of the year
rose by 7.7 percent to 7.876 billion dollars from 7.313 billion
dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, exports posted a 9.6 percent year-on-year
upswing with an aggregate revenue of 8.607 billion dollars from 7.
852 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
For March 2000 alone, merchandise trade grew by 6.9 percent to
5.730 billion dollars from 5.359 billion dollars a year ago.
Exports grew by 10.6 percent while imports grew by 3.2 percent for
this month,said the office.
</P>
<P>
Capital goods led by telecommunication equipment and electrical
machinery, accounted for 39.3 percent of the aggregate bill as
importation grew by 10.8 percent to 1.076 billion dollars from 970.
691 million dollars in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
But payments for raw materials and intermediate goods fell by
10.8 percent year-on-year to 1.012 billion dollars in March from 1.
134 billion dollars a year earlier. The group has a share of 36.9
percent of the aggregate bill.
</P>
<P>
Data from the office also showed that the United States
remained the country' top source of imports with a share of 17.7
percent in March, followed by Japan, South Korea, Singapore,
Taiwan and Saudi Arabia.

<HEADLINE> Howard Responds Mahathir's Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard believed he was welcome in Asia.
</P>
<P>
It was an answer to Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir who said
Howard was not welcome in the region.
</P>
<P>
Howard was quoted Wednesday by the Australian Associated Press
as saying that "I'm going to Korea tomorrow and I was asked", and
"I've been to China, I've been to Japan, I've been to Indonesia
three times, I've been to Thailand, I've been to the Philippines,
I've been to a meeting in Malaysia". it was clear that Australia
was deeply involved with the region, he argued.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir has told Australian
television channel SBS that Mr Howard is not welcome in the region.
The interview is due to be aired tonight.
</P>
<P>
"You know you have a policy that was formulated by Keating and
then you change your policy because you now feel that Indonesia is
weak and you can impose your will," Mahathir said reportedly
adding that "I mean, if you have a policy, you should stick to
that policy and not change it simply because you think you can
bully others."
</P>
<P>
Howard refused giving a direct answer saying that "I think
perhaps I should wait until I see that interview before
considering whether I should respond to the comments allegedly
made by the Malaysian prime minister."
</P>
<P>
However his words were quite sharp. "Korea is Australia's
second-best customer. Our best customer is Japan. The last time I
checked they were both Asian countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Australia also maintained deep ties with Malaysia with 130,000
Malaysians educated here, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opposition leader Tim Beazley said Howard was paying
the price for his lack of effort in the region. "This is John
Howard's chickens coming home to roost," Beazley told reporters.

International Monetary Fund (IMF) here Wednesday Signed the
postponed Letter of Intent (LoI) for pushing forward the country's
economic reforms.

<P>
The LoI should be signed in April this year, but it was

economic situation in Indonesia has improved and the government is
serious in implementing the programs in the LoI.

<HEADLINE> Drought Hampers Kenya's Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan economy is unlikely to pick
up this year due to the ongoing drought, a report by the Central
Bank of Kenya said.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard, a major newspaper in the country,
Wednesday quoted the report, the Monthly Economic Review for May,
as saying that the current economic slowdown is expected to
continue.
</P>
<P>
A halt to the dismal economic performance will only take place
in 2001, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The document also warned that the inflation pressure fuelled by
the drought is expected to filter further through into the
commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
There was a general price hike as a result of the shortage of
basic food items caused by the drought, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The overall month-on-month inflation rate in April hit 4.1
percent from last month's 3.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Some 700,000 people will be at risk if the drought lingers on
in north and northeast of the country, according to another
statistics provided by the United Nations Children's Fund.

<HEADLINE> Hewlett-Packard Reports Better-Than-Expected Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Hewlett-Packard Company (HP)
, a Computer giant in the world, reported Tuesday that its fiscal
operating profit for second quarter this year had beaten Wall
Street's expectations.
</P>
<P>
According to a news release by the company, during the period
ending April 30, HP saw its earnings from continuing operations of
87 cents per diluted share, seven cents more over that anticipated
by Analysts of the earnings tracker First Call.
</P>
<P>
Sales from continuing operations during the quarter rose 15
percent to 12 billion U.S. dollars from 10.5 billion dollars of
the same period last year, the company said.
</P>
<P>
Including charges for items including its early retirement
program, the spin-off of Agilent Technologies, stock appreciation
rights and equity gains, HP posted net income of 935 million
dollars, or 79 cents per diluted share.
</P>
<P>
Executives at HP in Palo Alto, California, attributed the
quarter's better-than-expected results to strength of several key
product areas, including personal computers and network servers
that run the UNIX operating system.
</P>
<P>
They also said the company remains on track to post a revenue
growth of 12 to 15 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
UNIX server revenue was up 26 percent, the company reported.
HP's notebook computer revenue increased 180 percent, while home
PC revenue rose 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
HP's printing and imaging business, the company's largest,
posted a more modest revenue growth during the quarter, rising 9
percent to 5.1 billion dollars from 4.7 billion dollars last year.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Apologizes Over "Divine Nation" Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori
on Wednesday apologized in the Diet (parliament) for causing "
misunderstandings" by his recent remarks that Japan is a divine
country with the emperor at its center.
</P>
<P>
"If there were any misunderstandings, I feel sorry for them and
offer my apologies," Mori told a plenary session of the House of
Councilors.
</P>
<P>
Mori, however, did not touch on the possibility of withdrawing
the remarks. He told reporters earlier in the day at his official
residence he would not rescind the comments.
</P>
<P>
Mori's apology came after his remarks, linked by some to
Japan's nationalist fervor before and during World War II, drew
widespread criticism from opposition parties and disapproval from
his own cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Mori on Monday said at a meeting of pro-Shinto lawmakers, "
Japan is a divine country centering on the emperor. We have been
working for 30 years to have people firmly acknowledge that."
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties say Mori's remarks run counter to the
principles of democracy and the separation of politics and
religion expressed in the country's constitution.
</P>
<P>
Japan's constitution, which took effect in 1947 after World War
II, stipulates the emperor shall be the symbol of the state and of
the unity of the people, deriving his position from the will of
the people with whom resides sovereign power.
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's parliamentary session, Japan's opposition camp
continued their attack on Mori's remarks.
</P>
<P>
Ryohei Adachi, upper house member of the main opposition
Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), said the remarks "run counter to
the principle of democracy enshrined in the Constitution and
cannot be dismissed as a gaffe," and urged Mori's cabinet to step
down en masse.
</P>
<P>
The DPJ is mulling whether to submit a no-confidence motion
against Mori's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
During a debate on Mori's remarks, the morning session became
rowdy, prompting Juro Saito, president of the upper chamber, to
announce a recess. Mori made the apology after the session resumed
shortly after 12:45 p.m. local time (0345 GMT).
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Japan's religious groups on Wednesday
blasted Mori's remarks.
</P>
<P>
Kenichi Otsu, a senior official of the National Christian
Council in Japan, said the remark could "knock the bottom out" of
Japan's constitutionally protected political system.
</P>
<P>
"Mori's remark is very questionable, coming as it does from
Japan's top political leader," said Otsu, whose council represents
33 Protestant groups in Japan.

<HEADLINE> Lakers, Trail Blazers To Meet In Western Conference Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 16 (Xinhua) - The Los Angeles Lakers and
Portland Trail Blazers Tuesday came out of their second rounds of
NBA playoffs respectively, and the two will fight for the
champions in the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
The lakers, losing Game 4 to the Phoenix Suns Sunday,
rediscovered their defense Tuesday night. They found a killer
instinct, too.
</P>
<P>
Shaquille O'Neal had 15 points, 21 rebounds and three blocked
shots despite sitting out the fourth quarter as the Lakers
humiliated the Phoenix Suns 87-65 to win the best-of-seven Western
Conference semifinals in five games. Kobe Bryant scored 17 points
and Glen Rice added 14 for the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers had two 10-0 runs in the period on their way to a 49-
23 halftime lead. That 23 points tied the playoff record for
futility in a half set by Utah in the second half of a 96-54 loss
to Chicago Bulls on June 7, 1998 in the NBA Finals. The 54 points
are the playoff record low for a game.
</P>
<P>
The Suns also tied the playoff record for futility in a second
quarter, when they scored nine to the Lakers' 28.
</P>
<P>
Todd Day led the Suns with 10 points, all but two in the fourth
quarter. Jason Kidd, who had 22 points, 10 rebounds and 16 assists
for his first playoff triple-double in Game 4, was held to eight
points, seven rebounds and two assists. Cliff Robinson and
Anfernee Hardaway, Phoenix's other big guns, each scored eight
points.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, who won an NBA-high 67 games during the regular
season, face the Trail Blazers in the best-of-seven conference
finals, starting Saturday at Staples Center in downtown Los
Angeles. The Blazers and Lakers haven't played since Feb. 29, when
Los Angeles won a matchup of the league's top teams.
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers eliminated the Utah Jazz on Tuesday night
with an 81-79 victory in Portland, also in five games.
</P>
<P>
The Jazz, beaten for the second straight year by the Blazers,
have been a perennial contender, twice reaching the NBA Finals.
But it was the last game for that team in its current form.
</P>
<P>
Guard Jeff Hornacek has said he is retiring. And it's doubtful
Utah can make another run without dramatically changing the team
surrounding Karl Malone and John Stockton.
</P>
<P>
"This is a tough way to end the season," said Malone who had 27
points and 11 rebounds. "You get nothing for second place in this
business."
</P>
<P>
Throughout the series, Utah again looked old and unathletic as
it again raised questions of whether Malone and fellow superstar
John Stockton ever will win a title. The Jazz reached the NBA
Finals in 1997 and 1998, losing to Chicago each time.

<HEADLINE> Stone Cannons Unearthed Along Great Wall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 17 (Xinhua) -- More than 20 stone cannons
unearthed in north China have been proven to be weapons used by
ancient guards along the Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
The stone weapons made from compact and seamless stones were
discovered by archaeologists and builders in Shanhaiguan Pass on
the seashore of Bohai Sea where the Great Wall starts.
</P>
<P>
"The Great Wall stone cannons were used only in the eastern
area of the Great Wall during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644)," said
Wang Xuenong, head of the Shanhaiguan Pass Great Wall Museum.
These weapons used to defend the Great Wall weigh 200 to 300
kilograms and are 80 to 160 centimeters long.
</P>
<P>
Modern weapon experts believed that the stone cannons could
shoot repeatedly and had served as a strong defensive weapon
during the Ming Dynasty. They estimated that the range of the
stone cannon is no more than 50 meters.
</P>
<P>
The Great Wall was first built during the Warring States Period
(475-221 BC). It starts at Shanhaiguan Pass in the east to
Jiayuguan Pass in northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
The 6,000-kilometer-long Great Wall was a means of defense
against raids from northern Nomadic tribes from the fifth century
BC to the 16th century AD.

XI'AN, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese veterinarians said that the
life of female giant panda Dan Dan is not in danger. Dan Dan was
recently diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma in her tail.
</P>
<P>
Veterinarians from the Xijing Hospital and local veterinary
hospital carried out pathological test here today, and found that
the cancer is not life-threatening.

<HEADLINE> 2.5 Million Chinese Take Wrong Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Ms. Wang bought a bottle of
medicine to lower her high blood pressure at a drugstore in
downtown Beijing. But she found that the medicine which was
actually a medicine for neuropathy.
</P>
<P>
Like Wang, many Chinese people have been given wrong medicine
suffering from adverse drug reaction (ADR).
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 2.5 million people fall victims
to ADR annually in recent years, and about eight percent of them
die from taking the wrong medicine.
</P>
<P>
According to a "China Youth Daily" report Tuesday, people who
used wrong drugs include those who bought over-the-counter
medicine according to the so-called "effects" that have seen
advertised while others took medicine in line with their own
knowledge about medicine, but not the advices of doctors.
</P>
<P>
Another Beijing resident had wanted to buy medicine to cure his
pericoronitis (a kind of tooth disease). Then he decided himself
to buy a kind of antiphlogistic pills which he believed to cure
his pain. But he was allergic to the medicine and suffered from
serious tetter.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Liu did not know how to take the medicine he had bought to
cure his chronic appendicitis. Then he just took it as often as he
used to in taking other medicines. However, he suffered from
diarrhea for several days running.
</P>
<P>
Other reasons for the large number of ADR sufferers include
taking medicine without careful reading the directions, purchasing
fake medicine, and buying medicine themselves in drugstores
according to their own knowledge to avoid long-time waiting for
treatment at hospitals or clinics.
</P>
<P>
"Don't regard yourself as a real doctor, even for some minor
diseases," the report stressed, warning that sometimes the side-
effect of medicine can be deadly. The report also urges
pharmaceutical factories to provide more detailed and easy-to-read
directions for the general public.

<HEADLINE> Party Pays Attention to Religious Work: Official (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Chinese Communist
Party have always paid much attention to religious work in the
country, said China's top official in charge of religious affairs.
</P>
<P>
In his article published in today's "Guangming Daily", Ye
Xiaowen, director of the State Administration of Religious Affairs
(SARA), noted that in the past 10 years, great progress has also
been recorded in the country's religious work.
</P>
<P>
The third generation of the collective leadership of the
Chinese Communist Party (CPC) Central Committee with Jiang Zemin
at its core attaches great importance to China's religious work,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
While upholding the correct policies of the previous
leaderships, the current CPC leadership has put forward a series
of measures and policies to better unite China's religious
believers and non-believers for the goal of building a socialism
with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The leaders emphasized that leading officials at all levels
should pay much attention to religious issues, do their utmost to
maintain the stability and continuity of religious policies, and
develop and consolidate the united patriotic front.
</P>
<P>
On many occasions, Jiang has stressed that how to properly
handle religious issues represents a major subject in China's
modernization drive and that all CPC officials should have a
Marxist religious outlook and be fully aware of the complexity and
importance of religious work.
</P>
<P>
In view of the great domestic and world changes around the end
of 1980s and early 1990s, Jiang pointed out that in the socialist
phase, religion will exist for a long time in the phase of
socialism and that the policies of freedom of religious belief
will not change.

<P>

Tuesday, a local newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 12 people, including nine Kuwaitis and three Bedouns

language daily the Arab Times quoted a well-informed source as
saying.
</P>
<P>

country's smallest Hawalli Governorate foiled an attempt by eight
men to smuggle about 500 kilograms of hashish into Kuwait by sea.

<HEADLINE> NZ Raises OCR As Inflationary Pressures Build </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of New Zealand
Wednesday decided to increase the Official Cash Rate (OCR) by 0.5
percent to 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Governor Don Brash of the New Zealand central
bank said: "We estimate that over the last two years the economy
has grown to the point where demand is beginning to put pressure
on capacity, and thus beginning to create inflationary pressures."
</P>
<P>
"It seems likely that inflation would increase in the next year
or two if monetary conditions were not gradually tightened further.
Today's decision to raise the OCR should be seen in this light,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The OCR determines the cost of borrowing and influences returns
on deposits.
</P>
<P>
The increase means another rise in home mortgage interest rates
is imminent, although people with money in the bank will also get
higher interest payments on their investments.
</P>
<P>
It also means New Zealanders have been hit with a three-punch
combination in the past 24 hours: up go interest rates, up go
petrol prices, and down goes the New Zealand dollar.
</P>
<P>
Petrol prices in New Zealand rose more than two cents of the U.
S. dollar a liter Wednesday and at the same time the New Zealand
dollar sank further to 46.72 cents of the U.S. dollar, hitting at
14-year lows.
</P>
<P>
The latest petrol price rises mean motorists are paying more
than 10 cents of the U.S. dollar a liter than they were last July.

<HEADLINE> Russian State Duma Set to Approve Kasyanov As New PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma is expected
to give Mikhail Kasyanov an easy ride Wednesday when the lower
house of parliament debates confirmation of him as the country's
new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Kasyanov, 42, appeared optimistic Tuesday after a series of
meetings with Duma faction leaders.
</P>
<P>
"There was a friendly attitude everywhere. The general spirit
of all the questions and discussions gives me optimism," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Vladimir Putin, who may attend Wednesday's Duma
plenary session, also met with faction leaders in the run-up to
the vote.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that up to 300 deputies would vote for Kasyanov,
far exceeding the simple majority required in the 448-seat chamber.
</P>
<P>
Most of the factions have expressed support for Kasyanov's
candidacy. The Communist opposition decided to let member deputies
to vote freely, a signal that it had no real objections to the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
Yabloko, the traditional opponent of the ruling establishment,
also made a similar decision, although it voiced dissatisfaction
following the meeting with the nominee.
</P>
<P>
Kasyanov, who was finance minister in the previous cabinet, is
a familiar face in the West as the government's top debt
negotiator.
</P>
<P>
The Russian media said that Kasyanov would make "an obedient
and industrious prime minister without any evident political
ambitions."
</P>
<P>
As first deputy prime minister since January, he has been in
charge of day-to-day running of the government and Putin is likely
to keep him in that role - primarily as a manager rather than a
policy-maker.
</P>
<P>
Kasyanov has spent 10 years in the economics and finance
ministries, but has little experience in other spheres of politics.
</P>
<P>
Born on December 8, 1957, Kasyanov is a fluent English-speaker.
He graduated from Moscow's Automobile and Road Institute, and
later worked at Gosplan, the Soviet Union's powerful economic
planning agency.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Condemns Tokyo Governor's Reckless Utterance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) denounced Japanese Tokyo governor on Wednesday for
his recent reckless utterances.
</P>
<P>
Governor Shintaro Ishihara asserted in a recent lecture that "
it is the best security to produce efficient weapons and sell them
to foreign countries," the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA)
quoted the Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun as saying.
</P>
<P>
A series of militarist and ultra-nationalist outbursts let
loose by Ishihara recently created a public furore. This time he
went to so far as to openly calling for the production and export
of sophisticated weapons under the pretext of "security", thus
exposing the invariable design of the right-wing reactionaries in
Japan to convert it into a military power and launch aggression
overseas, said the KCNA.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that this kind of agitation cannot but
spark public anger. The issue of Japan's "security" is
incompatible with its export of weapons. And it does not stand to
reason to export weapons on account of "security".
</P>
<P>
This is little short of Japan's intention to abandon its much
publicized "three principles of arms export", which, in fact,
exist in name only.
</P>
<P>
Through arms sale, the Japanese reactionaries seek to make
profits, secure their military clout and expand the sphere of
their influence so as to build a springboard from which to launch
aggression overseas, the KCNA stressed.

<HEADLINE> China Restructuring Power Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The China State Power Corporation (
CSPC) is launching a large-scale power restructuring and a
technical renovation in the sector, in a bid to transform CSPC
into a giant corporation with modernized management systems and a
share-holding mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The drive is designed to control pollution, increase economic
performance and guarantee safe operation, said the CSPC source.
</P>
<P>
CSPC expects to sell 845 billion kwh of electricity and make a
profit of 8.6 billion yuan by the end of this year through
restructuring the power industry and developing the country's
major power grids.
</P>
<P>
The sector expects to complete the renovation projects
involving 7.5-8 million kilowatt low and medium pressure condenser
tube generating units which have been in operation for at least 25
years by the end of this year, said the source.
</P>
<P>
The purpose is to improve the capacity of the units to meet
peak demand periods for power, improve security, reduce energy
consumption and protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
Through power restructuring, China has so far given greater
play to and put into operation the large-sized generating units
with capacity ranging between 300,000 kw and 800,000 kw.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the condenser tube generating units with generating
capacity less than 50,000 kw will be shut down step by step, the
CSPC source noted.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladesh Still in Dilemma on CEC Issue  By Pan Xiaozhu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- President Shahabuddin Ahmed said
Tuesday that appointment to an important office like Chief
Election Commissioner (CEC) should be made on the basis of
consensus among political parties in the country.
</P>
<P>
The president came up with his opinion when Chairperson of the
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and Leader of Opposition in
Parliament Begum Khaleda Zia met with him here on Tuesday night to
discuss the CEC issue amid growing contentions on the question
since Abu Hena resigned from the post on May 8.
</P>
<P>
Khaleda Zia met the president after talks with chiefs of three
other parties of the BNP-led four party alliance.
</P>
<P>
During her talk with the president, Khaleda Zia blamed the
government for "closing down the door" to proposed dialogue to
find out a consensus person for the post of CEC.
</P>
<P>
Khaleda Zia claimed that the opposition would not accept any
CEC appointed unilaterally by the government. She also told the
president that the new CEC, to be appointed in consultation with
the opposition, would not hold any elections before the next
parliamentary polls.
</P>
<P>
As the CEC issue continued to shake politics in the country,
the leftist 11-party alliance on Tuesday reiterated that a CEC
acceptable to all should be appointed on understanding and
consensus among all political parties.
</P>
<P>
A statement signed by 11-party coordinator Saifuddin Ahmed
Manik said that the question of appointment of CEC is not only
related to constitution and politics, but the entire electoral and
democratic process are involved. "The country should not be thrown
onto an undemocratic way," the statement stressed.
</P>
<P>
However, a government spokesman on Tuesday night ruled out any
chance for dialogue with opposition leader Khaleda Zia on
appointing CEC on consensus after her rejection of the talks
offered by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.
</P>
<P>
There is no scope at the moment after Khaleda Zia had summarily
turned down the prime minister's offer for discussion on the issue
of CEC, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a big public meeting last Sunday at Kurigram, 400
kilometers northwest of Dhaka, Khaleda Zia asked the government
not to look for a new CEC but to resign immediately to pave the
way for the appointment of the CEC by a caretaker administration
acceptable to all political parties.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said Tuesday night that an honest
and efficient person would be nominated as CEC who would be able
to conduct elections in a free and fair way.
</P>
<P>
Talking to a group of politicians here, the prime minister
noted that she had invited the leader of the opposition to discuss
the matter and "set a new trend in democracy upholding the spirit
of parliamentary democracy," but they did not respond.
</P>
<P>
According to sources of the ruling Awami League, the government
is still in a dilemma to choose the new CEC either from the
bureaucracy or from the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
The president, who would ultimately okay the nomination as per
constitutional provision, is in favor of appointment of a retired
judge of the Supreme Court while the ruling party preferred a man
having bureaucratic background.

</P>
<P>
The JSX Composite Index decreased 3.4 percent last week to
close at 526.87 points, compared to 545.61 the previous week.
</P>
<P>
"Amid rising stocks prices in the region bourses, the JSX
Composite Index dropped. This showed that foreign investors have
lost their patience and saw that domestic problems (in Indonesia)
still need a long time to recover and in turn they decide to
withdraw their investment activities from Indonesia," said Dandosi
Matram, a market analyst.
</P>
<P>
Political statements of the government officials made negative
reactions in the market, Matram was quoted by the Kompas daily
Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government has been badly criticized by analysts for being
too much occupied with political maneuvers while giving little
attention to the nation's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that the market perceive that the government
is not bluffing, and is not weak as well," senior currency dealer

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Celebrates Buddhist Sacred Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vesak is a sacred day to Buddhists the world over as the
birthday of Siddhartha Qautama, founder of Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
As bus loads of people came into the capital city of Colombo
from the early hours Wednesday morning, police and security forces
have intensified their patrols to ensure the safety of Buddhists.
</P>
<P>
In Sri Lanka, some 67 percent of whose population are Buddhists,
Vesak Day was declared as a public holiday as early as in 1885.
</P>
<P>
The country presented the fluttering of the six-color Buddhist
flag  to Buddhist community as the international flag of
Buddhists in 1886.
</P>
<P>
The Buddhist flag over the United Nations Headquarters building
on this Vesak Day reminds everybody the lofty contribution Sri
Lanka has made for world Buddhism, Buddhist community sources here
said.
</P>
<P>
"We will soon take steps to provide comprehensive and lasting
solutions to problems that beset us today, drawing from the
philosophy of Buddhism based on equality with honor and
coexistence which everybody can accept", said Sri Lankan President
Chandrika Kumaratunga in her message to the nation to mark the
Vesak Day.
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out that it should be the priority task
of the country to determine to promote cordial relations among all
communities bringing about a settlement to the ethnic crisis that
has been a calamity in the country for a period of nearly two
decades.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has long been plagued by problems between the
Sinhalese and Tamils-- the major ethnic groups in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels, who have been fighting for a separate Tamil
state since 1983, recently launched a fierce attack on government
troops in a bid to recapture their former stronghold in the Jaffna
Peninsula which they lost in May 1996.

<HEADLINE> BMB Acquisition Maximizes Value for State: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank Co. (
HSBC) Holdings will take a 75 percent stake in Bangkok
Metropolitan Bank (BMB) for 940 million U.S. dollars, the Bangkok
Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Salinee Wangtal, director of the Bank of Thailand's financial
institutions rehabilitation department, was quoted as saying on
Tuesday that the sale represented a 96 percent premium per share.
</P>
<P>
Based on BMB's par value of 29.4 billion baht (753 million
dollars), the Financial Institutions Development Fund would
receive a premium of 7.2 billion baht (184 million dollars) and
the rest would be returned to HSBC, she said.
</P>
<P>
"This is the highest premium which we have received for the
privatized state bank," Salinee said. "It is a deal which
maximizes value for the state."
</P>
<P>
Salinee said regulators will enter a loss-sharing agreement
with HSBC for managing non-performing loans.
</P>
<P>
The non-performing loans of the bank will be separated into two
pools according to their different estimates by the fund and HSBC.
</P>
<P>
For the first 75 percent of the delinquent loans, amounting to
some 90 billion baht (2.3 billion dollars), the fund will shoulder
85 percent of additional losses deriving from irrecoverable loans.
</P>
<P>
It will also shoulder some losses accruing from the remaining
non-performing loans.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Nakornthon Bank and Radanasin Bank, two financial
institutions sold by regulators last year, HSBC planned to manage
the bad assets within BMB rather than splitting them off into a
separate asset management company.
</P>
<P>
Final sales contracts still have to be approved by the cabinet,
Salinee said.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1959, BMB is the eighth-largest bank in Thailand.
The bank was seized by the development fund in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
The bank's first-quarter losses this year totaled 1.18 billion
baht (30.2 million dollars). Non-performing loans at the bank now
stood at around 60 percent, or 110 billion baht (2.82 billion
dollars).

<HEADLINE> Norway to Submit No More Application for EU Entry, PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Norway will not apply for a
European Union (EU) membership once again as Oslo is taking a more
cautious stand on the issue than before, Norwegian Prime Minister
Jens Stoltenberg told reporters here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He was answering a call from his Finnish counterpart Paavo
Lipponen that Norway should join the EU as soon as possible for
the sake of enhancing the role of the Northern European countries
in the development of Europe.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the latest poll that claims the majority of
Norwegian people support the participation in the EU, Stoltenberg
said he was not excited at all.
</P>
<P>
"Norway is the only country in the world that has held entry
negotiations with the EU but the people rejected admission to the
EU twice," Stoltenberg said. "So we should take a cautious
attitude on this issue."
</P>
<P>
Norway applied for EU membership in the 1970s and in early
1990s, but was forced to withdraw its application since most of
its citizens were against it.
</P>
<P>
Stoltenberg is on a one-day visit to Finland at the invitation
of Lipponen. The two leaders discussed Norwegian-Finnish bilateral
trade and economic relations, European security and defense
policies, the expansion of the EU, regional cooperation in the
Baltic Sea Region, and the situation in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Stoltenberg also said his country is interested in taking part
in EU's effort in handling crisis, adding Norway is ready to offer
resources in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Lipponen welcomed Norway's offer and expressed the hope that
the six NATO members who are not EU members will also take part in
checking the region's crisis. "I can't see any contradictions
between EU and NATO in tackling the EU crisis," Lipponen told the
joint press conference.
</P>
<P>
EU's actions in controlling the crisis will not affect the U.S.
interest in Europe or NATO's trans-Atlantic axial role, said
Stoltenberg.
</P>
<P>
"Europe is also able take responsibility for its own security,"
Stoltenberg added. "This will further clarify the purpose of the
United States, which is to cooperate with NATO."

<TEXT>
<P>
PORT OF SPAIN, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Li Ruihuan
arrived here Tuesday afternoon for a three-day friendly official
visit to Trinidad and Tobago, praising the island country for
developing its economy fast.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for a CPPCC chairman to visit this
Caribbean island country, and also the third leg of Li's ongoing
four-country trip to the Americas.
</P>
<P>
In a written speech he delivered at the airport, Li said that
the talented and diligent Trinidad and Tobago people have scored
remarkable achievement in their resolute efforts in development.
</P>
<P>
As an important country in the Caribbean region, Trinidad and
Tobago is playing an increasingly important role in regional and
international affairs and has made major contribution to regional
stability and development, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC National Committee chairman added that although
geographically far apart, the friendly exchanges of the two
peoples date back to two centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of diplomatic ties 26 years ago, Li
said, the friendly relations and cooperation between the two
countries have been constantly developing and growing in strength.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that the Chinese government attaches importance
to the development of its friendly relations and cooperation with
Trinidad and Tobago and cherishes highly the traditional
friendship.
</P>
<P>
It conforms to the fundamental interests of the two peoples to
increase exchanges, improve mutual understanding, enhance
friendship, expand cooperation and further consolidate and develop
the existing friendly relations and cooperation between the two
countries, Li concluded.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader and his entourage were welcomed at the
airport by Foreign Minister of Trinidad and Tobago Ralph Maraj and
other senior officials, as well as Chinese ambassador to this
country Zhang Songxian and local overseas Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Before Trinidad and Tobago, Li and his party have visited
Canada and Venezuela and they will also go to Peru for an official
visit after touring this island country.

<HEADLINE> Returned Liu Wins 100m Butterfly Title but Not Contented </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, May 17 (Xinhua) -- After two years away from Chinese
swimming pool, Olympic runner-up Liu Limin showed her supremacy
again in the women's butterfly, but admitted she was not content
with her winning result.
</P>
<P>
Liu, who returned from America's Nevada University in late
March, calmly tightened the screws in the second half and claimed
the victory in the 100m butterfly with a time of 59.86 seconds, 0.
75 faster than her nearest rival Ruan Yi last night at the
national swimming championships.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy I reached the Olympic standard, but the result was
below my expectation," said Liu, who blamed for her relapsed
rhinitis and lack systematic training since she came back home.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Liu won the first swimming gold medal for
Nevada University at NCAA last year and completed a gold-double in
the butterfly this March.
</P>
<P>
"I swam 59.15 in the 100m and two minutes 9.43 seconds in the
200m in the United States lsat August," said the Asian record
holder.
</P>
<P>
Liu's coach Zhao Ge, the national team head coach, was also
disappointed:" I had predicted she could swim within 59 barrier.
However, I have to say her result is OK after such a short time of
recovery."
</P>
<P>
Liu will bid for her 200m butterfly Olympic berth on Thursday.

<P>
TIANJIN, May 17 (Xinhua) -- A thumb-sized snuff bottle made in
the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) was auctioned for 2.42 million yuan (
about 292,000 US dollars) recently in Tianjin .
</P>
<P>
An anonymous collector from Beijing won the auction after 22
rounds of bidding, paying 2.12 million yuan more than the bottom
bidding price.
</P>
<P>
The tiny snuff bottle is made of white glass, and painted with
designs in bright enamel. It was authorized for production by the
ministry of internal affairs of the Qing Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Since the melting points of glass and enamel are nearly the
same, it was extremely difficult for ancient craftsmen to make the
small bottles without affecting the colors of enamel, said Xia
Gengqi, an expert on snuff bottles with the Beijing-based Palace
Museum.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Pest Insects Sell Out in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has sold out of ladybugs
and other varieties of pest-eating insects, as residents of the
Chinese capital have opted for a cheap and environmentally-
friendly means of pest control.
</P>
<P>
The city's supply of several million ladybugs had been housed
by the Biological Prevention Institute of the Chinese Academy of
Agricultural Science for use in scientific experiments. But they
went on sale when the prevalence of plant pests in the city in the
first four months of the year created public outcry, today's
Beijing Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, tens of thousands of insects kept by
the Chinese Academy of Forestry Science also became hot items in
short supply.
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, Beijing's parks and work units are battling pests
with bugs. The Temple of Heaven Park, Beijing's first park to use
the pest-control insects, initiated the method in 1991. The park
has brought in a large quantity of insects to kill tree pests this
year and the results have been good, according to park officials.
</P>
<P>
A researcher with the biological prevention institute of the
Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science said his institute has
bred over a dozen species of insects for pest control in the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
He said the anti-pest insects can also be applied to crops, and
for vegetable and fruit tree growth, and will help to improve the
quality of farm produce.
</P>
<P>
Ladybugs are less expensive than pesticides, selling for a few
cents apiece.

<HEADLINE> Decline in Baht, Stock Market Temporary: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Thai Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmannahaeminda downplayed the possibility of a new economic
crisis, saying recent declines in the baht and the Stock Exchange
of Thailand (SET) should be only temporary, the Nation reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Thai economy actually looked set to improve based on key
economic figures, Tarrin said, citing increases in export and
consumer spending, stable currency reserves and improvements in
non-performing loan ratios.
</P>
<P>
He said the declines in the baht and the stock market are in
line with other markets in the region, and do not reflect Thailand
's economic fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
The baht closed at 39.24 against the dollar Tuesday, down from
39.20 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the weekly Cabinet meeting Tuesday, Tarrin
echoed analysts' comments regarding the baht's weakness, blaming
it on a stronger dollar that has resulted from a likely rise in U.
S. interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the recent decline in the SET, Tarrin said similar
declines had taken place in other regional bourses, including the
Philippines, South Korea and Indonesia, after many investors sold
shares to buy debentures.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors have been worried about U.S. interest rates,
and prefer to invest in dollar-denominated instruments offering
higher yields, he said.
</P>
<P>
The SET index Tuesday rebounded 3.2 percent from Monday to
close at 350.22 points as investors returned to pick up oversold
shares.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports Council
(KONI) said the council would not protect athletes who were proved
by law enforcement agents to have consumed illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
KONI's official in charge of organizational affairs Putra
Astaman said the council did not have a problem with the police
apprehending the users, but they could not raid a training
location or sports school.
</P>
<P>
"We would be very thankful if the officers arrested athletes
taking illegal drugs in a discotheque or hotel. Still, the police
are not allowed to take action at any training sites," he was
quoted by the Jakarta Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"If KONI finds out an athlete is a drug user, KONI will take
stern measures and sanction him or her. Promising athletes will be
sent to a drug rehabilitation center. If the athlete becomes
addicted to drugs, we will not hesitate to expel him or her from
the sports community. We will also cooperate with the police but
we have yet to set a date to realize this. We will also report to
the police if we have information on athletes who take drugs. We
won't protect the athlete because he or she will become poison in
the sports community," he said.
</P>
<P>
Astaman recommended harsh punishment.
</P>
<P>
"They are trained people, so they deserve severe punishment.
They are like police officers. An officer is a trained person, so
they must receive sterner punishment if they are found guilty of
something," he said.
</P>
<P>
Illegal drug user is already prevalent among national athletes.
There also have been instances of athletes taking medication which
contained substances banned by their international sports
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Others intentionally used banned substances to enhance their
performance and some are addicts. Recent attention has focused on
drug use among soccer players, including Kurniawan Dwi Yulianto,
who was long considered one of the country's best strikers.
</P>
<P>
Astaman said he could not estimate the number of athletes
suspected of taking drugs.
</P>
<P>
"But there is an indication that drug dealers have targeted the
sports community. They thought that athletes have enough money to
buy their goods," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said at Ragunan Sports School in South Jakarta, drug dealers
offered their goods to athletes and coaches.
</P>
<P>
Astaman said KONI would allow sports organizations to sanction
athletes charged with using drugs.
</P>
<P>
"We respect the freedom of sports organizations in deciding
sanctions imposed on athletes who consume illegal drugs. KONI will
take over the decision-making if the case exceeds the authority of
the organization," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The latest establishment of
Huangnihe Nature Reserves protecting Siberian tiger and Japanese
stone pine added the number of nature reserves and preserves in
Jilin Province to 42.
</P>
<P>
Jilin Province is in northeast China with Changbai Mountains in
the east, plain in the middle, and prairie in the west. It was
selected to be an ecological pilot province in China last year for
its typical geology.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that there are 437 kinds of wild animals and
nearly 4,000 kinds of wild plants in the province. Jilin has made
10.4 percent of its land, or 1.94 million hectares, into nature
reserves in order to protect these wildlife and create a better
environment for them.
</P>
<P>
"A sound ecological environment is a must for human beings'
existence," said Zhang Lufeng, an official in charge of wildlife
protection in the province, "it is of scientific, biological and
tourism values for China and the rest of the world to establish
and well manage nature reserves."
</P>
<P>
The Changbai Mountains have been appraised by the World
Wildlife Fund as a nature reserves at the degree of "A".
</P>
<P>
Hunting has long been forbidden since the provincial
legislative body adopted a decree in 1996 to forbid hunting for
five years in the province.
</P>
<P>
The province has confiscated some 100,000 hunting guns and
punished 700 people for violating the law.
</P>
<P>
Wildlife rescue stations established at the provincial and city
levels have rescued 4,500 wild animals.
</P>
<P>
The protection measures resulted in reappearance of Mongolian
gazelles, Siberian tigers and leopards which were once believed to
have or endangered to extinct.

BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- April consumer prices dropped by 0.
9 percent from March, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said

<HEADLINE> Tianjin to Move away 80-Year-Old "Hills" of Alkali Waste </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 17 (Xinhua) -- A huge project is underway in north
China's Tianjin municipality to move away three hills of alkali
wastes that have been piled up over the past 80 years.
</P>
<P>
The three hills containing 24 million cubic meters of wastes
and covering a land of four square kilometers can make a 6,000
kilometers-long, one-meter wide and four-meters tall wall.
</P>
<P>
The environmental friendly project is the largest in this
aspect in China at present and is believed to be one of the top
500 environmental friendly projects in the world, according to
local experts.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the latest move, China has tackled the pollution of
Dianchi Lake in southwest China's Yunnan province and the residue
of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Co. in north China's Shanxi province.
</P>
<P>
The alkali wastes hills in Tanggu District of Tianjin were the
left-overs of China's oldest alkali plant, the Tianjin Alkali
Plant established in 1917. The wastes liquid flew out of the plant
and gradually formed the three hills after over 80 years'
deposition, causing pollution to nearby households and urban
environment as well as Haihe River which runs through Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Using a new technology, technicians will mix the alkali residue
with coal ashes to turn them into a kind of building material for
infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
The project also includes the building of a new residential
area on the four-sqaure-kilometer land of the hills, with new
buildings, roads, and grassland. The whole project is expected to
be completed by the end of 2003.

<HEADLINE> Experts Call for State Aid and Preparations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Agricultural experts in China are
calling on the government to accelerate the restructuring of the
rural economy to make agriculture more competitive in the world
market in face of China's expected entry into the World Trade
Organization(WTO), today's China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar yesterday at the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences(CASS), the experts agreed that agriculture is likely to
be one of the hardest hit industries after China joins the WTO,
and it is also the sector least prepared to face the challenges.
</P>
<P>
They asked related government departments to conduct and
sponsor more studies on the issue, which are lagging far behind.
Farmers should be helped to prepare for an imminent inflow of
cheap imports, they said.
</P>
<P>
The seminar marked the publication of an annual economic green
paper titled "1999-2000, Analysis and Forecast of China's Rural
Economic Situation," compiled by the CASS Rural Development
Institute and the General Organization of Rural Socio-Economic
Survey under the National Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated in the report that this year's total cereal
output will be 490 million tons, 10 million tons less than last
year. The output of cotton is also expected to drop, but beef,
mutton, fish and poultry production will increase.
</P>
<P>
Once China enters the WTO, tax barriers will be lowered on
vegetable, fruit, poultry and meat exports, whose production costs
are lower in China, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
However, imported corn, wheat, edible oils, cotton, sugar and
soy beans will be cheaper than their domestic counterparts, which
could seriously affecting the income of farmers.
</P>
<P>
Experts also call on the government to help re-employ some
farmers in other industries, and redistribute national income
among different groups of people with credit and taxation
adjustments.

ROME, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Italian marathon runner Giuliano

<HEADLINE> Chinese Archeologists Find Ancient Tomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Archeologists have discovered an
unusual ancient tomb in northeast China which buries 35 bodies
collectively.
</P>
<P>
The tomb, dating back to the bronze age, is 31.5 meters long
and 3.5 meters wide. Archeologists say the bodies were sent into
the tomb at the same time and the cause of their death remains a
mystery.
</P>
<P>
The dead are aged between six months and 50 years old and there
is an equal proportion of gender. Two women in their 30s seem to
have taken a higher social status because they possessed more
funerary objects.
</P>
<P>
The bodies all lie face up, arms and legs bent, and heads
towards the east.
</P>
<P>
Buried together with them are pottery, jade, stone and mussel
items.
</P>
<P>
The tomb was discovered in a historical site in Tonghua city of
northeast China's Jilin province, where archeologists have already
found 56 tombs and a large number of relics.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists say the discovery is significant for the study of
ancient funerary custom.

<P>
These problems indicate that it is necessary that China make
greater efforts to restructure agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Present at the press conference were officials and experts from
the Department of Agriculture affiliated with the Research Office
of the State Council, the Agriculture Group affiliated with the
Policy Research Office of the Communist Party of China Central
Committee, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The officials and experts pointed out that China's accession to
the World Trade Organization (WTO) will produce an impact on
agriculture within a short period of time, affecting the income of
farmers.
</P>
<P>
The government cannot underestimate the adverse effects WTO
membership may have on agriculture, and should make preparations
for this, otherwise China's agriculture will have more to lose
than to gain, the officials and experts said, adding that new
strategies and polices should be worked out as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Han Jun, deputy director of the Rural Institute of the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the country should
promote the development of animal husbandry and the breeding of
aquatics, plant more fruit trees, vegetables and flowers, and pay
greater attention to food processing.

<HEADLINE> South Koreans Break Through Darkness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 17 (Xinhua) -- It could not be much
surprising if South Korea goes all the way through to the finals
of the Thomas Cup badminton championship.
</P>
<P>
But it did surprise everybody, even the South Koreans
themselves, when they topped Group A ahead of title contenders
Denmark and Malaysia, after wrapping up the preliminary round with
the third win in row over India 4-1 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It seemed now South Korea could join Malaysia, Indonesia and
China to be the fourth nation to win the world men's team
championships, which were initiated in 1948.
</P>
<P>
"The Thomas Cup battle here is the most unpredictable one in
the past decade," China's coach Li Yongbo said Monday, after he
witnessed South Koreans' first-round success.
</P>
<P>
Seeded only fifth, South Korea raised eyebrows after they edged
off Malaysia 3-2 on Friday on their first outings and stole the
biggest victory of the preliminary round with a 3-2 slash of
Denmark on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two doubles pairs, world No.2 Kim Dong Moon/Ha Tae Kwon and
world runners-up Lee Dong Soo/Yoo Yong Sung, were the basement
where Koreans' confidences building upon, but it was the singles
players who escalated them to another level of their performances.
</P>
<P>
Second singles player Lee Hyun Li, 20, ranked 48 in the world,
jumped onto the stage when he beat Malaysia's Ong Ewe Hock, rated
15th. His victory over world No.3 Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen proved to
be the turning point when Denmark and South Korea tied on 1-1 on
Sunday's matchup before South Koreans steered up.
</P>
<P>
Hoyer-Larsen, turning 35 in September, paid his tribute to his
15-year-old younger conqueror, "He was unbelievable as he returned
everything I threw at him. When I played fast, he followed, and
when I slowed the tempo down, he did the same.
</P>
<P>
"I find it hard to believe he is only 20 for he played like an
experienced player. I couldn't keep up with him."
</P>
<P>
Lee contributed his success to his Chinese coach Li Mao, who
coached Chinese world champions Sun Jun and Dong Jiong before he
left for South Korea in 1999. "I'd like to thank to my Chinese
singles coach Li Mao. He gave me lots of good advices during
trainings," Lee said after a cool 13-15, 15-12, 15-12 comeback win
over the 1996 Atlanta Olympic singles champion.
</P>
<P>
After the three preliminary round wins, Lee became one of the
most formidable singles shuttlers, even South Koreans' hope to
topple China in the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
"If we want to beat China, we must get a point from the second
or third singles," said Kwon Seung Taik on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Lee made a great improvements in the tournament." Park Tae
Sang gave South Koreans the ecstasy by beating Kenneth Jonassen,
15-7, 15-7 in the decisive fifth game when second doubles Lee Dong
Soo and Yoo Yong Sung lost to Jesper Larsen and Jens Eriksen, 15-
10, 15-1 at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
Denmark's manager Thomas Lund said, "We'd expected a tough game,
but we had never thought we could lose two singles matches."
</P>
<P>
Not just Lund who was dumbfounded by the brilliant renascence
of South Korea's singles after the Asians were barred from the
finals three straight times during the span from 1992-1996, and
failed to make the semi-finals in the last version of the
competition in Hong Kong of China in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The glistering Thomas Cup trophy has never been so close to the
South Koreans.

JERUSALEM, May 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross
met with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Tuesday evening in Tel
Aviv to discuss the peace process amidst outbreak of violence in
Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israeli sources said the two touched upon the violent clashes
between Israeli forces and Palestinians, and the planned Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon.

During the one-and-half hour meeting in the Israeli Defense
Ministry, they also discussed the secret negotiations in Stockholm,

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Demands Peace Enforcer Status in West Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria Tuesday called on the
international community to recognize its role as the "peace
enforcer and keeper in the West African sub-region" if it was
requested to play a more active role in solving Sierra Leone
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Vice-President Atiku Abubakar presented the demand
during his talks with visiting British Chief of Defence Staff
Charles Gutherie in the capital Abuja, the News Agency of Nigeria
reported.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar said that non-recognition of such status made the
United Nations and other international bodies ignore Nigeria's
warning on the impending danger in that strife-torn country.
</P>
<P>
"Nigeria had seen the trouble coming and had warned the U.N.
and other appropriate international bodies, yet the warnings were
not taken seriously, " he said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Nigeria's resolve to intervene in the current
crisis triggered by Revolutionary United Front rebels who held
around 500 U.N. peacekeepers hostage early this month, but
insisted that the international community must be ready to foot
the bills for Nigeria's contribution to further military
reinforcement in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Gutherie, who also held a closed-door meeting with Defence
Minister Theophilus Danjuma, said he tried to persuade the
Nigerian leaders to get more involved in Sierra Leone and seek
ways of ending the deteriorating situations in the west African
country.

<HEADLINE> Released U.N. Troops Return to Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNTIED NATIONS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations said here
Wednesday that a group of some 90 peacekeepers detained earlier
this month by the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in Sierra
Leone had returned to the nation's capital Freetown, just hours
before the RUF leader, Foday Sankoh, was arrested by the Sierra
Leonean police.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh was captured around 6 a.m. on Wednesday (local time)
and is now in police custody, the U.N. spokesman, Fred Eckhard,
said here.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 93 former U.N. detainees -- 14 Kenyans and 79
Zambians -- arrived in Freetown late last night in "reasonable
good condition," with two people suffering from malaria, he said.
</P>
<P>
The remaining former detainees were still in the Liberian
border town of Foya and were expected to be transported to
Monrovia, the Liberian capital, and returned to Freetown Wednesday,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are extremely concerned about the reports that some of
these detainees in Foya may be injured and may be requiring urgent
medical assistance," he said. "They will receive the necessary
care at the Lungi Reception Center, set up to clothe, feed and
look after the released detainees."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. peacekeepers were deployed in the West African
country to monitor a peace accord signed last July to end the
nation's eight-year civil war.
