Two cloned calves die soon after birth at research center
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two female calves cloned from cells taken from an
adult cow died shortly after they were born at a local livestock
research center in northwestern Japan, a researcher said Friday.
	   The cause of the deaths late Thursday was not yet known, said
Akio Izumi of the Ishikawa Prefectural Livestock Research Center.
	   Izumi said the twin clones, who had not yet been named before
they died, had been having difficulty breathing.
	   The calves, which were born two weeks premature, both died
within twenty minutes of their births. Researchers tried
unsuccesfully to revive them with massages, Izumi said.
	   On Saturday, a calf cloned from cells taken from a cow fetus
died just 16 hours after its birth at another local cattle breeding
development institute in southern Japan. The calf, a male Holstein,
died of bleeding from the naval area.
	   Local Japanese livestock centers, some with the help of
university researchers, are conducting the nation's ambitious
program to seek ways of consistently reproducing cows that give
more milk or have higher quality beef.
	   Earlier this year, scientists in the United States succeeded in
cloning a cow from fetal cells.

Former Beijing Mayor sentenced to 16 years imprisonment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS in graf 10 that Chen served as mayor from 1983, adds
Chen's age &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A once powerful Communist Party leader was
sentenced Friday to 16 years imprisonment in China's largest graft
scandal, signaling Chinese leaders' renewed determination to clean
up their corruption-tainted government.
	   Chen Xitong, a former mayor and party boss of Beijing, is the
most senior party member to be prosecuted in a five-year campaign
against official corruption that already has seen Chen's son and
other high-level politicians jailed.
	   Many Chinese had believed that Chen was too powerful to put on
trial. So his sentence, while less harsh than those handed down to
some other, lower-ranked officials, indicated that Chinese leaders
are determined to push ahead with their anti-corruption battle.
	   In pursuing their campaign, Chinese leaders have acknowledged
that rampant official graft has provoked widespread public anger
that could undermine Communist Party rule unless assuaged.
	   Indicating that Chinese leaders hope to make an example of his
case, Chen's conviction was announced nationwide on state-run media
shortly after the Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court passed
sentence.
	   The court sentenced Chen to 13 years imprisonment for corruption
and to four years imprisonment for dereliction of duty, the
state-run Xinhua News Agency said.
	   In all, Chen will serve 16 years imprisonment, Xinhua said. It
was not immediately clear why the two sentences were not added
together to make a total of 17 years.
	   The court also ordered that bribes Chen accepted should be
confiscated and handed over to the State Treasury, Xinhua said.
	   Chen can appeal the verdict in the next 10 days, but Xinhua did
not say if he would do so.
	   Chen, 68, ruled Beijing first as mayor and then party secretary
from 1983 to 1995. His downfall confirmed the suspicions of many
Chinese that corruption reached into the highest levels of the
party.
	   Chen stepped down as Beijing's party secretary in 1995 after a
protege committed suicide rather than face arrest for corruption.
Chen's administration was described as a hotbed of graft, kickbacks
and misdeeds that possibly cost the city as much as 18 billion yuan
(more than dlrs 2 billion) in public funds.
	   Chen was expelled from the Communist Party in September and
handed over to prosecutors. Officials announced in March that
prosecutors had finished their investigations and that court
proceedings against Chen would be launched soon.
	   Since his arrest, Chen has been kept out of public view. Rumors
circulating in Beijing had him detained in Inner Mongolia or kept
at a seaside mansion. Hong Kong media recently reported Chen was
moved to a Beijing hospital this year for health problems.

Castro reconciles with Jamaican enemy in Caribbean rapprochement

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Fidel Castro and one of his most
outspoken foes in the Caribbean buried their differences in a
meeting that reflected the Cuban leader's triumphant push for
regional recognition.
	   ``Every conflict has a beginning and has an end, and we have
come to the end,'' Edward Seaga, a former Jamaican prime minister
who once severed his country's ties with Havana, told The
Associated Press.
	   The hour-long meeting Thursday reflected the regional
reconciliation that has taken several Caribbean leaders to Havana
over the past 18 months and inspired them to launch a diplomatic
offensive against the tough U.S. stance on Cuba, exemplified by a
nearly 38-year-old embargo against the communist-ruled island.
	   ``We also do not believe that the embargo has any purpose,''
Seaga said. ``(It) has certainly not demonstrated any usefulness.''
	   At a rally Thursday night, Castro railed against the American
sanctions, saying Washington was ``trying to kill our children by
starvation.''
	   He thanked Jamaican Prime Minister P.J. Patterson and the
Caribbean peoples for denouncing the blockade. He said such
solidarity was the only way for small nations to stand up for their
rights in a globalized world that would ignore them.
	   Castro attacked the North American Free Trade Agreement, that
joins the United States with Canada and Mexico, and a successful
U.S. challenge to the Caribbean's preferential trade in bananas to
the European Union.
	   ``Countries with different degrees of development cannot be
treated equally ... It would not be fair, it would not be humane,''
he said to cheers from a crowd of thousands.
	   NAFTA, he said, had robbed the Caribbean of more than 100,000
jobs and more than 150 garment factories. Many of the jobs and
factories went to Mexico.
	   In a six-day trip ending Aug. 3, Castro is visiting Jamaica,
Barbados and Grenada _ all countries that shunned him at one time
or another.
	   The only opposition to his visit has been voiced in Grenada.
Some politicians on that island say Castro's visit is an insult to
the United States, which lost 18 soldiers in a 1983 invasion to
oust Marxist hard-liners who had overthrown a Cuban-allied
government. Forty-five Grenadians and 29 Cubans also were killed.
	   Seaga said his meeting with Castro, the first ever between them,
was ``very amiable, very frank and vintage Castro, in that we both
had an opportunity to talk around the subject.''
	   ``The subject'' referred to fears from the 1970s that Castro
might export his revolution, taking over Jamaica through proxies.
In Cuba, military training camps were run for Jamaicans, and the
Kingston government of Michael Manley nationalized businesses under
a Cuban-inspired program that damaged the economy and caused
educated and skilled Jamaicans to emigrate.
	   ``Thousands upon thousands left the country,'' Seaga said. ``It
caused the split of many, many families.''
	   In 1980, when Seaga was elected prime minister, ``the economy
was in shambles, almost bankrupt ... and the ambassador was
boasting about Cuban might and what Cuba would do to its enemies.''
So Seaga expelled him and cut ties with Havana.
	   ``We were locked in conflict,'' he said.
	   But on Thursday, Seaga said, ``We made it quite clear that those
days are behind us. We are not dealing with memories. We are
dealing with the future.''

Japan's new prime minister concentrates on economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous; Obuchi news conference planned for 0700 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's new prime minister jumped to work on the
country's pressing economic problems Friday, convening his Cabinet
only hours after being elected and vowing to plow ahead with
reforms and an economic stimulus package.
	   Keizo Obuchi, who served as foreign minister under his
predecessor Ryutaro Hashimoto, was elected premier by Parliament on
Thursday after overcoming a challenge by the country's top
opposition leader.
	   After meeting with top officials from the new government, Obuchi
promised quick action.
	   ``This is a cabinet that will be able to resolve issues one
after another in a decisive and speedy manner,'' Premier Keizo
Obuchi declared early Friday. ``I will do all I can to implement
the financial rebuilding plan as early as possible.''
	   Obuchi moved quickly to win voters' confidence and reassure
worried markets Thursday by announcing an ``economic reform
Cabinet'' with a party economics expert as finance minister, a key
position in plans to power Japan out of recession.
	   More bad economic news hit the new administration Friday: the
government announced that Japan's unemployment rate surged to a
record high of 4.3 percent in June, up from two consecutive months
at 4.1 percent.
	   The June figure is the highest recorded since the government
began its current system of compiling unemployment data in 1953.
	   Obuchi, however, is considered by critics to be too entrenched
in the conservative ways of the Liberal Democratic Party to take
the bold, innovative steps needed to solve the structural flaws of
the Japanese economy.
	   He tried to reverse that image this week by naming former Prime
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa to take the finance minister's job.
Miyazawa, 78, is respected by many as an economics expert and is an
architect of the government's plan to bail out its debt-laden
banking system.
	   On Friday, Miyazawa told Finance Ministry officials that new
policies were needed because the nation's economy was in
``extremely bad shape.'' He also said future policies would have to
be explained to voters, rather than simply imposed as in the past.
	   ``The most important thing is to get the understanding of the
Japanese people,'' he said.
	   One of the first orders of business for Parliament, which began
an 70-day extraordinary session on Thursday, is legislation setting
up a so-called ``bridge bank'' plan to liquidate failing financial
institutions.
	   The new government is under heavy international pressure to move
fast. In Washington, U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers said he hopes the new government will boost economic
growth, deal with the banking problems and accelerate deregulation.
	   ``These economic imperatives remain present with the political
changes,'' Summers said. ``We hope the new Japanese government will
move rapidly and effectively in each of these areas.''
	   In Thursday's vote, Obuchi won easily in the LDP-controlled
lower house. But the opposition-dominated upper house chose
Democratic Party leader Naoto Kan, considered Japan's most popular
politician.
	   Since the lower house has the power to overrule the upper house
in the vote for premier, Obuchi was declared the winner after a
conference between the two chambers failed to come up with a
compromise. It was the first time the chambers had split in a vote
for premier since 1989.

Human rights deteriorate in Cambodia after polls: Amnesty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Amnesty International urged
strongman Hun Sen to call off his security forces Friday from
terrorizing members of the opposition following last Sunday's
parliamentary elections.
	   ``It is essential that the CPP-controlled security forces cease
their intimidating behavior immediately,'' said Demelza Stubbings
of the London-based human rights group following reports of
intimidation against local opposition activists.
	   The human rights situation in Cambodia has deteriorated since
Hun Sen apparently won the parliamentary polls, triggering
retribution by forces loyal to his Cambodian People's Party against
those who had challenged him.
	   Scores of supporters of Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC
party and the Sam Rainsy Party have fled Cambodia's rural areas to
Phnom Penh, seeking refuge at their parties' headquarters.
	   ``One after another, terrified people are fleeing their villages
in fear of their lives,'' Stubbings said. ``They have received
death threats and their houses have been surrounded and shot at by
security forces.''
	   Ranariddh won U.N.-organized elections in 1993. Hun Sen, who
headed a single-party communist state with Vietnamese backing in
the 1980s, refused to accept defeat and forced his way into a
co-premiership with threats of war.
	   He deposed Ranariddh last year in two days of fighting in the
capital. Official results of the election could be released
Saturday, but preliminary figures put the Cambodian People's Party
in the lead. Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy are disputing the results.

American women swimmers defeat World All-Stars
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late swimming; SUBS final graf with Sang Lan
receiving hospital visit from DiCaprio. &QL; 
 &UR; By BILL BARNARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Jenny Thompson thought she was tired
after a tough night at the Goodwill Games. Then she remembered how
grueling, and successful, Cristina Teuscher's night had been.
	   ``I am so spent,'' Thompson said after holding on in the final
decisive event, the 400-meter freestyle relay. ``The last 5 meters
(yards) were fuzzy and in slow motion.''
	   A night before, the final relay was the downfall of the U.S. men
against Germany. This time, the U.S. team won.
	   The American women gained a 65-57 victory over the World
All-Stars with a relay triumph anchored by Thompson, a five-time
Olympic gold medalist. But Thompson said the real hero was
Teuscher, who won the 800 and 400 freestyles and swam an
outstanding third leg on the final relay.
	   ``I shouldn't be complaining,'' said Thompson, 25, of Dover, New
Hampshire, holding her cramping side. ``Cristina had a tougher
night and she did a tremendous job.''
	   ``At least it got easier as the night went on _ from 800 to 400
to 100,'' said Teuscher, of New Rochelle, New York. ``On relays,
the energy and momentum take over. But I was pretty nervous about
the three races I had to do.''
	   The dual meet victory over the All-Stars put the Americans on
the inside track for the team gold medal.
	   The two teams each won seven of the 14 events, but the United
States won the meet because it finished 2-3 in five of the seven
events the All-Stars won.
	   ``It was a team effort because every single place counts in a
dual meet,'' said Lea Maurer, 28, of Crestwood, New York, who won
both backstroke events and swam a leg on the medley relay.
	   Thompson swam the butterfly leg on the medley relay and won the
100 butterfly in the seventh-fastest time in history, just five
minutes before the freestyle relay.
	   No U.S. woman besides the three veterans won an individual
event.
	   But Richelle Fox of Scotia, New York, played a big role in the
freestyle relay. Swimming first, she took a one-second lead over
Rania Elwani of Egypt.
	   Sylvia Bereknyei of Pittsburgh, California, maintained a
half-second edge over Nadezhda Chemezova of Russia before Teuscher
completed her grueling night by extending the margin to 1.3 seconds
over Wilma Van Hofwegen of the Netherlands.
	   Martina Moravcova of Slovakia cut into the margin against
Thompson, but couldn't catch her. The times were 3 minutes, 45
seconds for the United States and 3:45.39 for the World team.
	   ``It was slow motion, but I made it to the wall,'' Thompson
said.
	   In the other dual meet Thursday, Germany defeated China 80-42,
the second straight defeat for the formerly formidable Chinese
women's team.
	   Michelle Kwan dazzled the crowd and the judges at figure
skating.
	   The two-time world champion and Olympic silver medalist scored a
string of 5.9s and one perfect 6 to take the lead after the women's
short program.
	   European champion Maria Butrskaya of Russia was second and
Viktoriya Volchkova of Russia was third.
	   It was another rough night for American boxers in the
semifinals. They started with two straight losses to Russians _
Michael Evans in a 3-2 decision to featherweight Andrei Koslovsky,
then light middleweight Jermain Taylor of Little Rock, Arkansas, in
a 13-9 loss to Gaidarbek Gaidarbekov.
	   World champions Anjelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov led the
ice dance after the figure skating short program, ahead of another
Russian couple, Irina Lobacheva and Ilia Averbukh. Americans
Jessica Joseph and Charles Butler were fourth.
	   In women's beach volleyball, the top two teams stayed unbeaten,
while the defending champions got their first win.
	   No. 1 Shelda Bede and Adriana Behar of Brazil beat Julien Manser
and Kerri Pottharst of Australia, 15-9, before Lisa Arce and Holly
McPeak of Manhattan Beach, California, defeated Eva Celboa and Sona
Dosoudilova of the Czech Republic by the same score.
	   If they keep winning, the Brazilians and the Americans will meet
for the championship Sunday in Central Park.
	   ``We want to play them in the gold-medal match,'' Arce said.
``That's the best scenario. They're good friends of ours and that's
what we kind of said, `Win all your matches and we'll see you in
the finals.'''
	   Liz Masakayan and Karolyn Kirby of San Diego, losers in the
opener against Manser and Pottharst, beat Canada's Kristine Drakich
and Guylaine Dumont 15-5.
	   Meanwhile, gymnast Sang Lan was moved from a hospital on Long
Island to Mount Sinai Rehabilitation Institute in New York City's
borough of Manhattan to begin the next step of rehabilitation from
a practice accident that left her paralyzed.
	   She received a visit Thursday night from actor Leonardo
DiCaprio, the star of ``Titanic.'' The 17-year-old from China had
asked to meet the actor while hospitalized at Nassau County Medical
Center, where she was taken after she landed on her head during
vault warm-ups July 21. Doctors say she probably never will walk
again.

<TEXT>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) _ Gerald Williams and Andruw Jones each homered
and drove in three runs in a balanced attack that carried that
Atlanta Braves to a 13-3 victory Thursday over the Cincinnati Reds.
	   Denny Neagle (11-9) gave up five hits in eight innings as the
Braves took three of four in the series and completed a 7-2 road
trip. At 72-37, the NL East leaders are 35 games over .500 for the
first time this season and have the best record in franchise
history.
	   The Reds lost for the 12th time in 14 games and lost two players
to injury. Infielder Pokey Reese tore a ligament in his right thumb
while diving for a ball at third base in the fifth inning and will
require surgery. Second baseman Bret Boone sprained his left ankle
while catching a grounder in the seventh and left the game.
	   Williams got the Braves going by drawing a game-opening walk
from Rick Krivda (0-2) and stealing second and third in a
three-pitch span off the left-hander's slow move to the plate. He
scored on a sacrifice fly by Tony Graffanino, the only Braves
position player who finished without a hit.
	   Barry Larkin and Willie Greene homered for the Reds.
 &UR; Marlins 4, Astros 3
	   In Houston, Livan Hernandez pitched a five-hitter and Cliff
Floyd hit a three-run homer as the Florida Marlins beat the Astros
and avoided a sweep.
	   The Astros won the first three games of the series, but Florida
came back to snap a four-game losing streak and finish its road
trip 2-8.
	   Floyd gave the Marlins a quick 3-0 lead with his home run in the
first inning off Shane Reynolds (12-7).
	   Hernandez (9-7) struck out seven and walked three in his sixth
complete game, third-most in the NL. He struck out Ricky Gutierrez
with runners on first and second to end the game.
 &UR; Diamondbacks 4, Cubs 0
	   In Phoenix, Omar Daal threw a four-hitter, the first complete
game shutout in Diamondbacks history and the first of Daal's
career, as Arizona gained a split of the four-game series.
	   Devon White, in what might be his last game for Arizona, drove
in two runs with a home run and two singles batting out of the
cleanup spot.
	   Daal (5-5), a 26-year-old left-hander, struck out seven and
walked three in his second complete game of the season and the
fifth by Diamondbacks pitcher.
	   White, considered a prime candidate to be traded by Friday
night's deadline, hit his 15th home run of the season onto the
swimming pool deck in right field to lead off the third against
Chicago starter Kevin Tapani (12-7), giving Arizona a 3-0 lead.
 &UR; Dodgers 3, Phillies 1
	   In Philadelphia, Chan Ho Park allowed only two hits in eight
innings and tied a career high with his fifth straight victory,
leading Los Angeles over Philadelphia.
	   Park (10-5) struck out four and walked two to match the longest
winning streak of his career set last July 10-31.
	   Park, who surrendered back-to-back singles to Doug Glanville and
Gregg Jefferies in the fourth inning, has allowed only four hits in
his last 16 innings.
	   Philadelphia starter Matt Beech (3-7) pitched six strong innings
but took his fourth consecutive loss.
 &UR; Padres 3, Mets 1, 10 innings
	   In New York, pinch-hitter Carlos Hernandez doubled to drive in
two runs in the 10th inning as San Diego beat New York to win for
the 11th time in 14 games and avoid its second three-game losing
streak of the season.
	   The Mets lost for only the third time in 11 games.
	   Dennis Cook (6-4) relieved Mets starter Bobby Jones to begin the
10th. Cook hit Jim Leyritz with a pitch with one out, Chris Gomez
singled with two outs and Hernandez doubled to the gap in
left-center field.
	   Dan Miceli (8-4) pitched a hitless ninth in relief of Sterling
Hitchcock for the win, striking out two. Trevor Hoffman worked the
10th for his 34th save.
 &UR; Cardinals 3, Brewers 2
	   In St. Louis, Pat Kelly kept up his hot hitting while batting
out of the ninth spot, driving in two runs as St. Louis snapped
Milwaukee's four-game winning streak.
	   Kelly, who has batted ninth in 10 games since being acquired
from Toronto on July 16, is hitting .302 in 13 games since the
trade. He reached base safely seven times and drove in three runs
in his last three games _ all while batting one spot behind the
pitcher.
	   Mark McGwire failed to hit a home run for the second straight
game, going was 0-for-3 with a strikeout and his major
league-leading 111th walk.
	   Matt Morris (2-1) allowed one hit over five innings. Mark
Petkovsek pitched three innings and Rick Croushore worked the ninth
to pick up his seventh save, retiring Jeff Cirillo on a liner to
first with the bases loaded to end the game.
 &UR; Expos 12, Giants 6
	   In Montreal, Vladimir Guerrero homered for the second straight
game _ his team-record 11th in July _ and Brad Fullmer added a
two-run homer to lead Montreal over San Francisco.
	   Guerrero drove the first pitch he saw from Mark Gardner (8-5)
leading off the fourth over the wall in center for his 25th home
run. Guerrero has hit six homers in his last eight games.
	   Fullmer hit his eighth homer off reliever Chris Brock with two
outs in the fifth to give Montreal an 8-1 lead.

Former diplomat and champion of TV brain game dies at 84
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sir David Hunt, a former private secretary to
Prime Ministers Winston Churchill and Clement Attlee and a former
ambassador to Brazil, died Thursday at the age of 84, his family
said.
	   Educated at Oxford, where he achieved a top class degree in
Classics, Hunt served in the army in World War II as an
intelligence officer.
	   After joining the diplomatic service in 1947, he went on to
serve as private secretary to Attlee and Churchill.
	   In 1960 he accompanied Prime Minister Harold Macmillan on an
African tour and penned the premier's famous ``winds of change''
speech made to the South African parliament during the trip. After
serving as a diplomat in Uganda, Cyprus and Nigeria, Hunt was made
ambassador to Brazil between 1969 and 1973.
	   In 1963 he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II.
	   He published many scholarly works, including books and articles
on art history and an autobiography in 1975.
	   Hunt moved from quietly working behind the scenes to fame on the
small screen when he became champion of the high-brow television
brain-game show ``Mastermind'' in 1977, with the specialist subject
the Roman Revolution.
	   Five years later he was crowned ``Mastermind of Masterminds''
when he defeated all the winners from the previous 10 years. His
specialist subject was Alexander the Great.
	   After that victory he admitted that completing The Times
crossword on the train to London from his home in West Sussex,
usually took him less than 10 minutes, although his record was six.
	   Married twice, Hunt had two sons and four grandchildren.
	   A memorial service in London is planned for later in the year.

Mexican police arrest suspected Basque separatist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Police in western Mexico arrested a Basque
separatist accused of terrorist acts in Spain.
	   Interpol agents in Morelia, 135 miles (217 kilometers) west of
Mexico City, arrested Manuel Quintans Lopez on a provisional
extradition request filed by Spain with Mexican authorities, local
media reported Thursday.
	   Spanish authorities accuse Quintans Lopez of belonging to the
Basque People's Guerrilla Army, and of kidnapping, homicide and
illegal possession of arms and explosives.
	   Mexico has agreed to extradite such suspects but in the past has
more frequently expelled them on the grounds that their immigration
papers were not in order.

Australia and U.S. fear Myanmar problems may trigger refugee crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The United States and Australia fear
that Myanmar's crackdown on dissent could lead to social chaos and
a flood of refugees into Thailand, Foreign Minister Alexander
Downer said Friday.
	   Emerging from talks with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen, Downer said
he was speaking for both countries in expressing their worry over
events in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma.
	   ``We are deeply concerned about the situation in Burma,'' Downer
told reporters at the HMAS Watson military base, where the talks
are taking place.
	   ``Both Australia and the United States share the view that the
treatment of Aung San Suu Kyi over the last few days has been
unacceptable,'' he added.
	   Myanmar's military-led government forced the Nobel laureate back
to the nation's capital against her will, ending a six-day highway
standoff.
	   ``We are now very concerned that the internal security
environment in Burma could deteriorate rapidly. That could, in
turn, lead to a big increase in refugee flows into Thailand and
perhaps broader regional implications flowing from that.
	   ``As a consequence, we think that still more international
pressure needs to be brought to bear on Burma,'' Downer said.
	   He was echoing criticism issued the day before by Albright, who
said Myanmar's treatment of Suu Kyi was ``an unacceptable violation
of human rights.''
	   ``Suu Kyi was all of a sudden taken in her car by a military
driver back to Yangon and thereby forbidden from exercising a basic
human right, which is the ability to travel freely in your own
country,'' Albright said.
	   The opposition leader accused the government of kidnapping her
to end a six-day standoff, saying police held her down, took the
wheel of her car and forcibly drove her back to the capital. The
government admitted returning the democracy campaigner to the
capital against her will Wednesday evening, but has not explained
its tactics.
	   Albright and Cohen will give a joint news conference with Downer
and Defense Minister Ian Mclachlan later Friday when the
U.S.-Australian talks conclude.

Three held after police find explosives in car search
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Three men were being questioned
by detectives Friday after the seizure of a suspected explosive
device, police said.
	   The device was found during a search of a car in Omagh town
center in County Tyrone, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) west of
Belfast, on Thursday night.
	   Officers stopped the car after noticing ``suspicious activity''
in the area and arrested three men, a police spokesman said,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Meanwhile, a 25-year-old man was shot in both legs in a
paramilitary-style punishment attack in Belfast, police said.
	   Police said the man was recovering in a hospital with gunshot
wounds to both legs after the attack.

U.S., Swedish, French and British companies interested in defense
</HEADLINE>
group

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ U.S., British, French and Swedish
contractors are among the companies seeking to buy ADI, the
Australian government-owned defense industry business, analysts
said Friday.
	   The five short-listed groups will now be invited to undertake
due diligence and prepare bids for assessment, Defense Minister Ian
McLachlan and Finance Minister John Fahey said in a joint
statement.
	   The five companies were not named. However, defense industry
sources listed them as:
	   _Systems Engineering Consortium of Australia, comprising Visy
Industries, National Australia Bank (NAB) and Swedish arms
conglomerate Celsius.
	   _GEC-Marconi Australia, subsidiary of the British defense
electronics firm GEC-Marconi, owned by General Electric Co. of
Britain.
	   _British Aerospace Australia, subsidiary of British Aerospace of
Britain.
	   _Tenix Defense Systems of Melbourne and Lockheed-Martin, the
U.S. aerospace giant.
	   _Transfield of Australia and French firm Thomson-CSF.
	   Excluded, apparently because it said it was only interested in
acquiring ADI's systems division, was U.S. aerospace firm Raytheon.
	   ADI was formerly Australian Defense Industries.
	   McLachlan and Fahey said timing for completion of the sale
process depended on the announcement of a tenderer for the U.S.
dlrs 620 million (1 billion Australian dollars) navy guided missile
frigate upgrade project. ADI and Tenix are the two contenders.
	   ``Should ADI be selected as the preferred tenderer ... the value
placed by bidders on the company could be expected to be
significantly enhanced,'' the ministers said.
	   ADI was formed in 1989 out of the Office of Defense Production,
the government-owned shipyards and munitions factories which dated
back to the last century and routinely drained the defense budget
of up to U.S. dlrs 186 million (300 million Australian dollars) a
year.
	   In 1996/97 ADI recorded a profit of U.S. dlrs 26 million (42
million Australian dollars).
	   The company now has 3,400 employees and turnover of more than
U.S. dlrs 372 million (600 million Australian dollars).

	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ By now, Michelle Kwan is so
comfortable with Rachmaninov's Piano Concerto No. 3 that it feels
like a part of her. Just in time to discard it for something new.
	   Blending brilliantly with the music one last time Thursday
night, she seized the lead with a flawless short program in the
Goodwill Games.
	   ``I might bring it back in a couple of years,'' Kwan said, ``but
that's the last time this year. The best part was the footwork. It
was the thing I'll miss the most.''
	   Coach Frank Carroll said he's a little sad about surrendering
the program that has served Kwan so well this season.
	   ``I really think it's special, with special feeling and impact
on the audience and judges,'' he said.
	   So why give it up?
	   ``It doesn't permit her to improve,'' Carroll said. ``It's
necessary for her development to do something new. It can become
stale if you don't move on.''
	   Kwan was anything but stale, dazzling the Nassau Coliseum crowd
of 5,581 _ about one-third capacity _ with a brilliant exhibition,
skating the program for the ninth time.
	   ``It felt really good,'' she said. ``The people were cheering so
loud, it was hard to concentrate. I said to myself, `OK, this is
the last time I am going to do this, so concentrate,' and I just
enjoyed myself, let loose and let it go.''
	   Kwan, the Olympic silver medalist and two-time world champion,
was the next-to-last skater. She made it worth the wait with a
flawless show as one of the headliners of these games, earning a
perfect score from one of the judges.

	   Kwan dazzled the audience in a performance that counted for
one-third of her final mark. The other two-thirds comes in Saturday
night's free skate.
	   With longtime rival and Olympic gold medalist Tara Lipinski gone
to the pros and Nicole Bobek withdrawn because of fatigue, Kwan was
left as headliner of the Goodwill competition. She did not
disappoint.
	   Wearing a red-and-pink sequined outfit, she opened her 2-minute,
40-second program with a triple lutz/double toe loop and flowed
effortlessly through the eight required elements, finishing with a
spiral sequence and combination spin that left the crowd standing
and roaring. They littered the ice with flowers as Kwan skated off.
	   She embraced Carroll after leaving the ice, then watched the
scoreboard flash her scores, which included six 5.9s and a perfect
6.0 from the English judge for presentation.
	   Can she skate better?
	   ``Of course,'' Carroll said.
	   On Saturday, she gets a chance to in the long program.
	   European champion Maria Butrskaya of Russia, skating to
``Fever,'' was second and Viktoriya Volchkova of Russia, who was
celebrating her 16th birthday and skated to Doga's Waltz, was
third.
	   Displaying a sense of joy that captured the crowd, the
world-champion Russian team of Anjelika Krylova and Oleg
Ovsiannikov maintained their lead in the dance.
	   With ``Five Months, Two Weeks,'' as their music for the original
dance, the Olympic silver medalists dashed around the ice with
abandon, earning a sweep of 5.9 scores for presentation from the
five judges.
	   ``We feel great,'' Krylova said. ``We have so much fun skating
here. We enjoy the public and they enjoy our show.''
	   The performance was worth 30 percent toward their final score
following the 20 percent from Wednesday night's compulsory dance.
The final 50 percent of the score comes in Saturday night's free
dance.
	   Second place belonged to another Russian couple, Irina Lobacheva
and Ilia Averbush, who skated to ``Tuitti Fruitti.'' The Ukranian
pair of Elena Grushina and Rusian Goncharov, who used ``Rock Around
The Clock'' as their music, were third.
	   American teen-agers Jessica Joseph and Charles Butler received a
rousing reception from the crowd of as they skated to ``Great Balls
of Fire,'' but remained last among the four pairs.
	   ``This is our favorite program,'' Joseph said. ``We love to do
it. It's a ton of fun and it seems so short. I wish we could be out
there longer.''

Hyundai Motor fires 1,500 workers despite labor protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Hyundai Motor Co. fired 1,569 workers
Friday despite labor warnings that mass layoffs will lead to a
prolonged strike at the nation's leading automaker.
	   Some 3,000 unionized Hyundai workers, rallying in the company
grounds, vowed to continue their work stoppage that has crippled
company operations for 12 days.
	   ``What management announced today means nothing. We will
continue to fight until the company retracts the layoff decision,''
said a statement from the Hyundai Motor union, one of the nation's
most militant.
	   Earlier Friday, Hyundai posted a list of 1,569 workers being
fired because of ``urgent management reasons.''
	   Hyundai management says it has no alternative but to eliminate
redundant manpower to save the country's No. 1 automaker from its
deep financial problems, caused by sharp drops in domestic sales.
	   It has already shed 5,000 workers through early retirements this
year. Then this month, Hyundai told an additional 2,687 workers to
take early retirement with extra bonuses, or face outright
dismissal.
	   By the midnight Friday deadline, only 1,118 had taken early
retirement, Hyundai said.
	   Hyundai's 26,000 unionized workers went on strike July 20,
protesting the planned layoffs.
	   Thousands of Hyundai workers and family members have since
picketed the main company plant in Ulsan, 280 kilometers (175
miles) southeast of Seoul, sleeping in tents and shouting slogans
demanding job security in daily rallies.
	   Riot police were deployed around the plant, blocking labor and
student activists from joining the workers inside.
	   Hyundai plants have a combined capacity of 1.25 million cars a
year. But its plants are operating at 40 percent of that capacity
amid a severe economic slowdown.
	   South Korea's economy was bailed out by the International
Monetary Fund in December, under strict conditions aimed at making
businesses more efficient. With bankruptcies mounting, more than
1.5 million workers have been driven out of their jobs.

Crew, scientists on fire stricken ship were ready to use lifeboats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ The crew and scientists aboard the
Australian Antarctic research ship Aurora Australis were prepared
to take to the ice after an engine room fire deep in Antarctic
waters nine days ago.
	   Lifeboats had been swung out over the deck before the fire was
put out, Aurora captain Tony Hansen said Friday.
	   Hansen said the fire was his most frightening experience in 24
years at sea, but he was proud that the ship had got home ``without
a cut finger'' among the 54 expeditioners and 25 crew of the
icebreaker.
	   The Aurora limped into Hobart on Friday on one engine. Within
hours, investigators were at work in the blackened engine room,
still full of the charred remains of pipes and cables, to pinpoint
the cause.
	   The fire in the early hours of July 22 ruined a pioneering
midwinter expedition to study a vast polynya, an area where savage
winds break up the sea ice and cause heavy, salt-laden water to
sink to the bottom.
	   Expedition leader Ian Allison believes a winter study would lead
to a better understanding of climate change and how the sea absorbs
carbon gases from the atmosphere.
	   The Aurora was about 57 miles (90 km) from the polynya when the
fire broke out in a turbocharger on the main engine, probably from
a fuel leak.
	   Hansen said his immediate reactions were ``fear first of all,
then the safety of everyone. And then you go into a different mode,
you're all in together. And self-preservation.''
	   He said the crew first tried to fight the fire by conventional
methods and for a time thought it was out.
	   But it flared again and after 21 minutes, he ordered the engine
room be doused with halon, an inert gas.
	   Fearing the fire might get out of control, Hansen had the life
boats swung over the side so they could immediately be lowered to
the ice.
	   It took nearly a day to restore sufficient power to run water
and heat the ship. Until then it was freezing.
	   Although the second engine was undamaged, the Aurora spent three
days drifting in the ice while new cabling and a water pump to cool
it were improvised.

U.S. places five more fighters in finals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with remaining bouts &QL; 
 &UR; By IRA PODELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Two-time Olympic silver medalist Juan Hernandez
of Cuba earned a spot in the Goodwill Games boxing finals Thursday
on a night otherwise dominated by American fighters.
	   Hernandez, a light middleweight, dominated two-time United
States champion Darnell Wilson to gain a 12-1 victory.
	   ``I didn't fight my fight,'' Wilson said. ``I'm going to hear it
from my coaches, I've already heard it from my wife.''
	   After losing the first two semifinal bouts, the United States
responded with wins in five of its next eight fights.
	   Michael Evans lost a 3-2 decision to Russian featherweight
Andrei Koslovsky in the first fight, before a 13-9 loss by light
middleweight Jermain Taylor of Little Rock, Arkansas, to another
Russian, Gaidarbek Gaidarbekov.
	   ``I landed some good shots,'' Evans said. ``But they didn't
count.''
	   Two fighters from Fort Carson, Colorado, split their bouts.
Olanda Anderson, the top ranked American light heavyweight, picked
up a 5-1 victory over Russian Denis Lebedev, while flyweight John
Medina was frustrated and bloodied by the awkward style of
Kazakstan's Yersin Jailauov in an 11-1 loss.
	   Anderson will face Isael Alvarez of Cuba for the light
heavyweight gold medal.
	   ``Russians are always tough,'' Anderson said. ``The Russians and
the Cubans are on the same playing field. They're both technical
fighters.''
	   Roberto Benitez, a flyweight from Marquette, Michigan, turned in
the best American performance with an overpowering 18-8 victory
over Vakhtang Darchinyan of Armenia. The United States' good
fortunes continued as featherweight Teaunce Shepherd, also from
Marquette, beat Russia's Aleksandr Mitishev 8-4.
	   Benitez, who turned 18 on Thursday, will take on Jailauov and
Shepherd, who lost to Evans for the U.S. Championship, will face
Koslovsky. Light welterweight Ebo Elder from Newman, Georgia, edged
Russian Dmitri Pavluchenkov 12-11 and will fight Cincinnati's
Ricardo Williams, Jr., who defeated Paata Gvasaliya, also of
Russia, 12-5.
	   The card ended with Alexis Rubalcaba of Cuba winning a 11-9
slugfest decision over another Marquette fighter, Dominick Guinn,
in the super heavyweight division.
	   The United States placed fighters in 10 of the 12 Thursday bouts
at the Theater at Madison Square Garden. Only three of the seven
American semifinalists who fought on Wednesday advanced to the
final round.
	   ``We're a good team, but we're young,'' Evans said. ``It's a lot
of our first times boxing in international competition.''
	   Taylor agreed that the American team that has won 17 medals at
these Games has overachieved.
	   ``Everyone was saying that we were only going to win one medal,
but look where we are,'' he said.
	   Bronze medals are awarded to all fighters who fail to advance to
the final round.

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ An outbreak of dengue fever, which started
in May, has claimed 166 lives in Vietnam, an official from the
Ministry of Health said Friday.
	   Tran Hung said nearly 70,000 people have contracted the disease
so far, two times higher than in the year-earlier period. The death
toll is four times higher.
	   Hung said that 226 of the 107,000 people who contracted the
disease died in 1997.
	   The 12 Mekong Delta provinces of southern Vietnam were hardest
hit by the fever because the dense network of rivers and canals is
an ideal environment for the mosquito-born disease, Hung said.
	   The official said the disease would peak when the rainy season
sets in in August and September. Hospitals are already reported
overcrowded in many affected provinces, with three patients sharing
a single bed at some medical facilities.

Quiet twist in regulations adds new hitch to Cambodian election
</HEADLINE>
results &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBIN McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A new controversy threatened to
erupt Friday over Cambodia's election results, as reports
circulated that a new, little-known formula to determine the
allocation of the winners' parliamentary seats would favor the
ruling party of strongman Hun Sen.
	   The government's National Election Committee has so far released
complete results of last Sunday's poll from just 16 of the
country's 23 provincial constituencies, giving only the number of
popular votes with no indication of seats won.
	   But the top independent monitoring group, the Committee for Free
and Fair Elections in Cambodia, or COMFREL, had said Thursday
morning that its figures showed that with 90 percent of the ballots
counted, Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party looked set to get 59 of
the 122 National Assembly seats.
	   Opposition party FUNCINPEC won 45 and its ally the Sam Rainsy
Party 18.
	   News of the change in the method of counting seats emerged later
when COMFREL revised its estimates of seats won, to give the ruling
CPP 64 seats, FUNCINPEC 43 and the Sam Rainsy Party 15.
	   The change is crucial, because if the projection is correct,
without the extra seats the CPP would fall short of having even a
simple majority in Parliament.
	   COMFREL head Thun Saray explained Friday his group had been
informed Thursday afternoon of a second official method to
calculate seat numbers, replacing a widely circulated method issued
earlier.
	   He said the first method of calculation under the highest
average system appeared to be more fair.
	   Opposition politician Sam Rainsy blasted the apparent change in
rules as ``unfair, arbitrary and unconstitutional.''
	   ``It is not in the election law and the NEC cannot change just
like this the formula at the last minute,'' he said on Friday,
after meeting with fellow opposition leader Prince Norodom
Ranariddh of FUNCINPEC.
	   COMFREL's Thun Saray said the National Election Committee told
him the new formula was adopted in April.
	   Asked about the existence of a new formula at a news briefing
Friday, a National Election Committee spokesman said only that the
committee would not do anything against the law.
	   An independent observer. Peter Schier of Germany's
democracy-promoting Konrad Adenauer Foundation, said he was also
caught by surprise by the new formula.
	   ``Apparently not many people know about the new formula except
the NEC and a few experts,'' he said.
	   Schier said the published election regulation issued May 25, the
day campaigning began, specified the original seat-allocating
formula, and he had no idea when that was changed.
	   Opposition leaders Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy after their meeting
Friday reiterated their refusal to consider a coalition government
with Hun Sen while they were still disputing the results of last
Sunday's election.
	   The two parties had issued a statement Tuesday saying they could
not accept the election results until their allegations of fraud
had been thoroughly investigated by national and international
observers.
	   They said that they were prepared to boycott the National
Assembly unless they were satisfied that they had not been cheated
in Sunday's polls.
	   Without the opposition's attendance, the assembly is unlikely to
have present the two-thirds of its 122 members needed to conduct
business.
	   Hun Sen countered Wednesday by saying he could lower the
constitutional minimum for the assembly to meet and confirm a
government from two-thirds to 50 percent plus one. He also said his
current government could remain in power.
	   Hun Sen traveled Thursday to the northwestern town of Siem Reap
to meet with King Norodom Sihanouk.
	   After talks with the monarch, he claimed to have won royal
approval for his proposal to form a coalition, under which he will
still hold all the important levers of power.
	   Though Sihanouk is largely a figurehead, his popularity among
many Cambodians and high international profile make his blessing a
vital step for Hun Sen to win back international legitimacy and aid
lost last year by staging a coup d'etat against his then
co-premier, Ranariddh.

Politicians demand action to help child migrants trace parents
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECASTS; UPDATES with comment from Australian government;
moves Australian angle up higher; EDITS to conform; NO PICKUP

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Thousands of people who were sent as children to
Britain's colonies as cheap labor, often without their parents'
knowledge or approval, must be given immediate help to trace their
families and authorities in Australia should prosecute those who
abused them, a government committee has urged.
	   Members of Parliament urged the government Thursday to apologize
to children who were victims of a policy, started in the 17th
century and stopped only in the late 1960s, in which they were sent
to countries such as Australia, New Zealand and Canada.
	   The children were sent as young as three and hardly any were
orphans. On arrival, they were frequently subjected to physical,
sexual and emotional abuse, the House of Commons health committee
said in a report released Thursday.
	   The migration was a joint enterprise between governments and
religious and children's charities in Britain.
	   The committee called on the government of Australia to
investigate the allegations of physical, mental and sexual abuse at
institutions where child migrants lived and said any surviving
members of staff implicated should be prosecuted.
	   ``We would expect the full weight of the law to be felt in cases
where physical and sexual abuse against former child migrants can
be proven,'' the committee said. ``Courts should award the maximum
possible damages when a conviction is obtained.''
	   About 150,000 children were dispatched to the colonies over a
period of 350 years. In the final period from 1947-1967, between
7,000 and 10,000 children were sent to Australia alone.
	   The committee took evidence from migrants that they were told,
wrongly, that their parents were dead, that they were beaten,
raped, treated as slave labor and given inadequate food, clothing
and shoes.
	   Often their names were changed and they were not told of their
true identity or even their birthday.
	   ``These children were placed in large, often isolated,
institutions and were often subjected to harsh, sometimes
intentionally brutal, regimes of work and discipline,'' the report
said.
	   The Australian government Friday ruled out an immediate inquiry
and criticized the report for passing the blame onto the Australian
authorities.
	   Family Services Minister Warwick Smith said it was a premature
to go straight to an inquiry, but it was not out of the question.
	   ``It is a little rich for some of the British people to now be
calling on the Australian government to inquire into a decision
that they made that defies all logic, sending 7,000 young children
to the other side of the world,'' Smith told the Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   ``The Catholic church has got some more explaining to do and I
will be asking them to do so,'' he added.
	   The Christian Brothers have already issued a public apology for
the abuse that took place in their institutions.
	   Barnardos, a well-regarded children's charity, told the
committee that it looked back with ``shock and horror'' on its past
as one of the agencies which sent the children abroad.
	   Former child migrants now trying to trace their relatives in
Britain say that the charities which sent them abroad are refusing
to help.
	   The health committee said the migrants and their descendants
should be given immediate access to all files containing
information about their background and that organizations must be
compelled to cooperate. Those who cannot afford to come to Britain
to find their families should be funded, the committee added.
	   The group also said therapy should be made available to those
left psychologically damaged by their childhood experiences.
	   The report concluded that the child migration policy was ``a
sorry episode in British history'' and said the government is under
a moral and legal duty to help the migrants now.
	   Lawmakers warned that time is running out because the former
child migrants are getting older and their parents, if alive, are
in extreme old age.
	   Surviving migrants are divided over whether compensation should
be paid to them, and the report does not recommend payments. It
says most former migrants are more interested in getting
information about their identity and background.

Army sergeant killed after cartridge case in gun explodes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A cartridge case in the gun barrel of a military
vehicle exploded at a training ground, killing a Japanese army
sergeant and injuring two others, a Defense Agency spokesman said
Friday.
	   The explosion occurred at the Ground Self-Defense Force's
training ground in Imazu, 345 kilometers (214 miles), west of
Tokyo, Thursday afternoon, Defense Agency spokesman Takayuki Hamada
said.
	   Sgt. Hideo Nabara, 36, was taken to a nearby hospital but died
of excessive loss of blood due to the explosion, Hamada said. The
other two received minor injuries.
	   Hamada said one of the three men pulled the trigger of the gun
while training at around 3:00 p.m. Thursday, but a 20-centimeter
long (8-inch) cartridge case failed to shoot from the barrel of the
Type 87 Reconnaissance Combat Vehicle.
	   The three soldiers were trying to remove the cartridge case,
when it suddenly exploded, Hamada said.
	   The cause of the blast was under investigation, Hamada said.

Tajikistan official dies after car bomb attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Tajikistan's deputy customs chief
died in a hospital Friday after sustaining wounds in a bomb attack
that destroyed his car outside the presidential palace in this
Central Asian Nation.
	   The bomb exploded Thursday while the official, Ali Emomnadzarov,
sat with his driver in a car parked 100 meters (yards) from the
residence of President Emomali Rakhmonov, said Tajikistan Interior
Ministry spokesman Dzhumakhon Khomatov.
	   Khomatov said Emomnadzarov's driver was still in critical
condition. Five passersby were also injured in the blast.
	   No one has claimed responsibility for the attack.
	   Tajikistan has been plagued by lawlessness since the Soviet
Union fell in 1991. A five-year civil war between the government
and mostly Islamic opposition ended last year, but sporadic
violence continues.

Typhoons feared as flood waters rise in China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Lower reaches of the swollen Yangtze River were
rising early Friday, and in northeastern China some 36,000 people
were moved away from the flooding Nenjiang river, state-run media
reported.
	   The seasonal floods that had killed 1,261 people as of Thursday
were spreading, despite signs of an abatement in torrential rains
that raised the Yangtze, in central China, to its highest level
ever in some areas, reports said.
	   Central stretches of the river, the world's third longest, have
swamped much of the region near the industrial centers of Wuhan and
Nanjing and further flooding was likely, the newspaper People's
Daily warned.
	   The report, citing meteorologists, noted that between five to
seven typhoons were likely to blow inland in August, causing
further heavy rains.
	   The annual floods, which have appeared to increase in intensity
in recent years, have raised questions about flood controls along
the Yangtze.
	   Thick silting caused by heavy erosion has raised the riverbed,
contributing to the problem, the Xinhua News Agency cited Flood
Control Headquarters officials as saying.
	   More dredging and construction of more reservoirs and better
levees all were needed to help prevent further catastrophes, they
said.
	   ``Flood control standards vary at different sections of the
river, with some embankments able to withstand the biggest flood of
a century ... while other levees can only prevent smaller
flooding,'' it quoted Tan Qifu, a senior engineer at the
headquarters, as saying.
	   Water levels upstream from Wuhan had begun to fall by Friday as
flood crests passed, but downstream the river was still rising, as
some 1.3 million residents and soldiers struggled to reinforce
waterlogged embankments on the verge of collapse.
	   In northeastern Heilongjiang province, some 36,000 people were
moved to higher ground as hundreds of thousands worked to contain
flooding along the Nenjiang river.
	   But the worst disasters have been in central China. Sixty
percent of Hunan province has been flooded, with 15 million people
_ a quarter of the population _ affected and 200 people killed,
said Wilson Wong of the Hong Kong Red Cross.
	   Chinese authorities requested medicines to treat flu, intestinal
and skin diseases, Wong said. A Red Cross team touring Hubei
province also reported seeing skin and eye maladies, but no sign of
diseases like cholera.
	   Flooded-out families sheltering in plastic covered lean-tos atop
dikes might have to wait another month to return home, said
Sharilyn Amy, a Red Cross worker in Wuhan.
	   ``We need to gear up for the long haul to maintain the level of
support and stave off epidemics,'' Amy said.

Seles reaches semifinals, Williams rallies to win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STANFORD, Calif. (AP) _ Despite being bothered by a change of
nine time zones and about 40 degrees (22 degrees Celsius), Monica
Seles became the first player to reach the semifinals of the Bank
of the West tournament Thursday night.
	   Seles had six aces and never lost her serve in the 6-3, 6-1 win
over Anne-Gaelle Sidot of France, but said she still is feeling the
effects of last weekend's Federation Cup matches in Spain and the
flight to California.
	   ``I still feel very lethargic, everything hurts in my body,''
said Seles, who was treated for dehydration after her first-round
victory Wednesday night and said her back was sore after Thursday's
quarterfinal win.
	   ``I never did this before. I think it's too much, my body is
telling me that,'' she said. ``I can't go to sleep. I think my
body's still confused what time zone I'm on.''
	   Venus Williams, seeded third in the dlrs 450,000 tournament,
rallied to reach the quarterfinals with a 4-6, 6-1, 6-0 victory
over Corina Morariu, who was one of Seles' teammates on the U.S.
Fed Cup team in Spain.
	   ``It's been tough for all of us,'' Morariu said. ``I think we've
all gotten a little tired during our matches here.''
	   Fifth-seeded Natasha Zvereva and No. 7 Elena Likhovtseva also
advanced to the the quarterfinals.
	   The U.S. Fed Cup team lost in the semifinals to Spain last
weekend on clay courts in Madrid. The matches were played in
100-degree (38-degree Celsius) heat, and the Americans expended
lots of psychological energy during the trip.
	   ``It was just such an emotional few days there, and it's so hard
to come back and play as an individual,'' Seles said. ``It took
some adjusting _ food, time change, weather. We were playing in 105
degrees and and here it's freezing at night.''
	   Seles, who won the Bank of the West in 1990 and 1992 and is
seeded second this year, uses the event as part of her buildup for
the U.S. Open later this summer. But she's afraid fatigue may cut
into her preparations.
	   ``If I feel like this,'' she said, ``I don't think I can play
that many weeks in a row.''

NEC to turn Packard Bell NEC into subsidiary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese electronics giant NEC Corp. will invest
dlrs 225 million in Packard Bell NEC Inc. to take a controlling
52.81 percent stake in the U.S.-based computer company, NEC said
Friday.
	   NEC, which currently owns 49 percent of Packard Bell NEC, also
said that Groupe Bull of France will invest an additional dlrs 25
million in the company, bringing its total new investment to dlrs
250 million.
	   That will give Groupe Bull an 11.68 percent interest in the
company, while Packard Bell Electronics will have 35.51 percent.
	   NEC said that by making Packard Bell NEC a subsidiary, NEC's
consolidated sales in the current fiscal year through March will
increase by 300 billion yen (dlrs 2.09 billion).
	   The new investment from NEC and Groupe Bull will be used to
boost Packard Bell NEC's sales and promote its restructuring
efforts, said NEC Vice President Seijiro Yokoyama.
	   NEC aims to publicly offer Packard Bell NEC shares in about two
years, he said.

Smoke from forest fires in Russian Far East disrupting flight
</HEADLINE>
traffic &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Smoke from raging forest fires in Russia's Far
East is preventing firefighters from battling the blazes and
disrupting flight traffic at a major regional hub, a news report
said Friday.
	   The smoke in the city of Khabarovsk is so thick that
water-carrying planes cannot take off to fight the fires 400
kilometers (240 miles) away.
	   Many arriving commercial flights must be diverted to
Vladivostok, 575 kilometers (350 miles) to the south, the Moscow
Times reported.
	   ``You can smell and even taste the soot in your mouth,'' said
Dmitry Lebedev, the Khabarovsk city environmental chief, according
to the Moscow Times.
	   Khabarovsk is Russia's main hub for flights to Asia.
	   Over 130,000 hectares (320,000 acres) of forest are burning out
of control in the region, though only a few remote settlements are
threatened by the fires so far.
	   Major fires are also burning on Sakhalin Island and the
Kamchatka peninsula.
	   An unusually dry winter and spring made the Far East more
vulnerable this year to the forest fires, which are normally
contained by summer. Lack of funds has also worsened the situation,
and specialists say that without significant rain, the fires may
continue until winter.

Yiddish summer school in Lithuania graduates first class
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MERCEDES SPROUSE &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ Once considered the Jerusalem of the
north, Lithuania's capital was all but purged of its Jewish
identity during World War II. Now, a Yiddish-language summer school
is reviving a nearly extinguished culture.
	   On Friday, the school was to graduate its first class _ dozens
of Jews and non-Jews from 14 countries. It's a small number
compared with the 200,000 Jews who once lived in Lithuania, 90
percent of whom were exterminated by Nazi troops who occupied the
country from 1941 to 1944.
	   But Dovid Katz, the school's program director, said the school
is not aiming to re-create the Jewish community that existed before
the war. ``My purpose is to create small numbers of dedicated
people who are also experts, who really know Yiddish, for whom love
of Yiddish is not some abstract, sentimentalist concept restricted
to singing songs and telling jokes and going to the theater once in
a while,'' said Katz, a professor at Oxford University in England.
	   For Jews, Hebrew is the language of scholars and Yiddish the
language of daily life. Millions of people throughout Central and
Eastern Europe once used Yiddish, and Vilnius was their
intellectual and spiritual center.
	   The Jewish community languished after the war, when Lithuania
was part of the Soviet Union, and now numbers about 3,500.
	   ``In Soviet times nobody spoke about Jewish issues or if they
did they spoke in negative terms,'' said Simonas Alperavicius,
chairman of the Jewish Community of Lithuania.
	   For many of the summer school students, studying Yiddish is as
much an opportunity to learn about their family as it was to learn
the language.
	   ``I saw the house where my mother grew up,'' said Miriam Dashkin
Beckerman, 70, of Toronto. ``The whole experience was surrealistic
because where there was once such a proud and wonderful Jewish
community, now a Jew is a rarity here. When I walk through the
streets, it strikes me that all our Jews lie buried in these mass
graves.''
	   Liora Grodnik, 19, of Vilnius said friends often wonder why she
chose to learn Yiddish rather than Hebrew. ``There are people who
say that Yiddish is not really important and that you should learn
only Hebrew, but this is my family language.''
	   It was the rich regional history of Yiddish culture that
prompted Briton Jeremy Grant to attend the school.
	   ``In America or England, when they try to make these courses the
environment is always very artificial,'' Grant said. ``Trying to
create a shtetl (village) in the middle of Oxford doesn't work. In
Lithuania you still find Yiddish as an everyday, spoken language.''
	   Jakovas Magidas, 51 years old and vice-chairman of the Vilnius
Jewish Community, is among those who help to keep Yiddish alive.
His Yiddish songs written over the last 30 years are popular among
native Lithuanian Jews and Jewish audiences in Germany and Poland.
	   ``I love Vilnius, but I prefer to sing in my native language,
Yiddish,'' Magidas said. ``I am happy to know the language that my
mother used to speak is still alive after difficult years.''
	   For others who witnessed history in this part of the world,
including Yiddish author Hirsh Reler of Belarus, the revival of
Yiddish is key to sustaining the Jewish community.
	   ``To maintain some part of your culture is absolutely vital,''
he said.

Report: Thai deputy premier seeks top WTO job
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Deputy Prime Minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi, a key member of the government's economic recovery
team, would rather take the helm of the World Trade Organization
than stay in Thai politics, the Bangkok Post said Friday.
	   Supachai, who also serves as commerce minister, is to be Asia's
sole nominee for the WTO directorship, which would become vacant
next year.
	   ``I want the WTO job, but don't yet know whether I'll get it.
With the WTO, the country's profile would be higher,'' he was
quoted as saying by the English-language daily.
	   The nomination is to be made in September.
	   Supachai is part of an economic team trying to grapple with the
worst economic crisis Thailand has faced in modern times. He is
also a leading member of the ruling Democrat Party.

Japan's jobless rate hits record high 4.3 percent in June
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from EPA official, think tank predictions
of jobless rate rising further &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Corporate retrenching and rising bankruptcies sent
Japan's unemployment rate to a record high of 4.3 percent in June,
the government announced Friday.
	   The jump followed two consecutive months at the previous high of
4.1 percent, the Management and Coordination Agency said.
	   Layoffs were the main cause of the surge in the jobless rate as
companies step up restructuring efforts to remain competitive
during Japan's recession and corporate bankruptcies soar, the
agency said.
	   The number of people forced out of their jobs increased to
900,000 in June, up by 340,000 from last year, the agency said.
	   The June unemployment figure is the highest recorded since the
government began its current system of compiling unemployment data
in 1953.
	   The Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Research Institute, a Tokyo
think tank, predicted Thursday that Japan's unemployment rate will
rise to 5.3 percent by 1999 and could hit 10 percent in the future.
	   Takafusa Shioya, administrative vice minister of the Economic
Planning Agency, said he was worried that rising unemployment may
further weaken domestic consumption. Slumping consumer confidence
is seen as one of the main causes of Japan's recession.
	   Demand for labor in June also fell, with 51 jobs being offered
in for every 100 seekers, compared to 53 in May. The ratio of job
offers to seekers was the lowest in Japan since January 1978.
	   The total number of people out of work actually fell due to
seasonal factors to 2.84 million from the record high of 2.93
million set in May, the agency said. But the number of jobless grew
by 550,000 from last year.
	   The jobless rate for women also rose to an all-time high of 4.2
percent in June, the agency said. The rate for men remained
unchanged at a record 4.3 percent.
	   The bad news comes one day after the inauguration of a new
administration headed by Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who has vowed
strong measures to combat Japan's worst recession since the end of
World War II.
	   Japan is under increasing pressure from its trading partners to
repair its troubled financial system.
	   Japan's unemployment rate would be significantly higher if
calculated by U.S. and European standards. The country counts
anyone who has worked one hour or more in the month surveyed as
fully employed.

Dollar rises, Tokyo stocks gain moderately
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stocks, mid-afternoon dollar, bond

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen Friday
afternoon amid speculation Japan won't soon intervene in currency
markets to support the yen. Tokyo stock prices closed moderately
higher.
	   The dollar bought 143.82 yen in afternoon trading, up 1.52 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate
of 143.66 yen overnight.
	   The dollar's strength came after Japan's newly appointed Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa made comments appearing to indicate that
he did not favor government intervention to boost the yen.
	   Miyazawa, a former prime minister, told a news conference early
Friday that the yen and stock markets should move ``on their own''
and intervention in foreign exchange markets should occur only
rarely.
	   Traders interpreted Miyazawa's remarks as diminishing the
likelihood that Japan's central bank will try to prop up the yen,
even if it falls further.
	   Miyazawa attempted to play down his remark later in the day
saying it was just a statement of ``a general principle'' that
reflected ``common sense'' rather than a shift in policy.
	   That apparent clarification by Miyazawa briefly pushed the
dollar down against the yen, but demand to buy the U.S. currency on
dips boosted it in afternoon trading.
	   ``Miyazawa's statement was just an expression of the principle
of intervention, but overseas players took it as a potential sign
of change in the current Japanese stance towards intervention,''
said Shuji Takano, senior trader at ABN AMRO Bank in Tokyo.
	   U.S. and Japanese monetary authorities sold dollars and bought
yen in a dramatic intervention June 17 to prop up the faltering
Japanese currency.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices rose on expectations
new Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's administration will carry out
permanent tax cuts and implement measures to write off massive bad
debts held by Japan's banks.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average finished the day at
16,378.97, up 177.37 points, or 1.09 percent. On Thursday, the
average closed up 43.51 points, or 0.27 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section rose 13.85 points, or 1.11 percent, to 1,262.85. The
TOPIX closed up 7.49 points, or 0.60 percent, the day before.
	   Traders were also encouraged by an overnight rise on Wall
Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 111.99 points
to 9,026.95.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.235 percent from Thursday's finish of
1.225 percent, driving its price down to 111.56 yen from 111.63
yen.

Pakistan's prime minister: Outcome of talks with India is `zero'

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of
Pakistan said a much-anticipated meeting with his Indian
counterpart to resolve longstanding border disputes accomplished
``zero,'' a Sri Lankan newspaper said Friday.
	   ``Yes, it is a stalemate. We are not here to waste each other's
time,'' Sharif told The Island newspaper.
	   Sharif spoke Thursday after he and Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee returned from a seaside retreat that was the site
of a three-day summit of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation.
	   His comments appeared to dampen hopes that accompanied their
first meeting in a year Wednesday, after which they ordered their
respective foreign ministries to find ways to continue stalled
discussions on disputes ranging from Kashmir to demarcating the
boundary of a lake.
	   ``The outcome so far is zero,'' Sharif said after Thursday's
meeting.
	   Top ministry officials from both nations prepared to meet again
Friday to pick up on points raised Thursday, but in the absence of
any common ground, little progress was expected.
	   The meeting between Vajpayee and Sharif carried extra symbolism
because it was their first face-to-face discussions since the
hostile neighbors conducted underground nuclear tests in May. The
tests provoked fears of an all-out conflict between the two
countries, which have already fought three wars, two over the
Himalayan region of Kashmir, since their founding in the final days
of British rule 50 years ago.
	   The nuclear tests also raised the prospect of an arms race in
Asia.
	   In the newspaper interview published Friday, Sharif accused
India of dragging its feet on Kashmir, which, he said, was the core
issue between the neighboring nations. ``So let us resolve the
issues of Kashmir in a serious and substantive manner so that we
would be able to make progress,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   The Indian government did not react immediately, but in the past
New Delhi has said it is willing to discuss Kashmir only in the
context of broader talks between the two nations. It also has
rejected mediation by a third country, which Pakistan favors.
	   Kashmir, a Muslim-majority area, was ruled by a Hindu king who
opted to join with India when colonial Britain carved out both
nations in 1947. The region is now divided between the two
countries.
	   Pakistan wants Kashmiris of both sides of the border to be able
to decide which country they want to join. India opposes the
plebiscite, outlined in United Nations resolutions of the 1940s.

Agassi advances in Mercedes Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Agassi-Gambill match &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Andre Agassi, coming off a victory last week
in Washington, beat Jan-Michael Gambill 6-4, 6-4 on Thursday night
to advance to the quarterfinals of the Mercedes-Benz Cup.
	   Agassi, seeded fifth, overpowered Gambill in the 78-minute match
in sharp contrast to their last meeting _ Gambill's 7-6, 3-6, 6-3
victory in March in the quarterfinals of the Newsweek Champions Cup
at Indian Wells.
	   ``Nobody beats you twice in a row. You beat yourself. The last
time we played I didn't execute and he took over,'' Agassi said.
``Tonight I executed. Every point matters a lot to me. I expected
him to come on strong, that's his game, but I got back into the
match.''
	   Agassi is preparing for the U.S. Open in five weeks in New York.
	   ``As an American, that's the tournament I get excited about,''
said Agassi, the 1994 U.S. Open winner. ``I'm eager and I have the
desire to go there. I want to get the job done.''
	   Agassi advanced to a quarterfinal match Friday against
Australia's Sandon Stolle, a 6-3, 7-6 (8-6) winner over countryman
Andrew Ilie.
	   Australia's Pat Rafter, preparing for his U.S. Open title
defense, beat Martin Damm of Czech Republic 6-3, 5-7, 6-1.
	   ``I thought I played well, but he got fit in the second. Then I
got to a fast start in the final set. This is the best I've played
in Los Angeles,'' said Rafter, who will face Justin Gimelstob in
the quarterfinals.
	   Gimelstob advanced when eighth-seeded Vince Spadea retired
because of exhaustion. Gimelstob led the match 6-3, 3-0.
	   ``It will be very tough, very intense. The last time we played
it was very close,'' said the second-seeded Rafter, who beat
Gimelstob 6-3, 5-7, 7-5 last year in Philadelphia.

Philippine Supreme Court dismisses judge for sexual assault
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine Supreme Court has
dismissed a trial court judge for sexually assaulting seven women
court employees on separate occasions last year.
	   In a 27-page decision Thursday, the high tribunal said trial
court judge Armando de Asa of suburban Caloocan city was found
guilty of taking advantage of his position to harass the women.
	   Asa was ordered dismissed and his retirement benefits and leave
credits forfeited. He was also banned from being employed in any
government office, including state-run companies.
	   The tribunal said Asa failed to meet the standards for
magistrates and behaved immorally. ``The bench is not a place for
persons like him,'' the court said.
	   It said Asa ``misjudged the victims to be fair game.''
	   ``We find totally unacceptable the temerity of respondent judge
in subjecting his subordinates to his unwelcome sexual advances and
acts of lasciviousness,'' the court said.
	   The tribunal dismissed statements of witnesses presented by Asa
and said the statements of the seven women were more believable.
	   Meanwhile, a prosecutor filed rape charges Thursday against
another judge in northern Quirino province for allegedly sexually
assaulting a 15-year-old girl last February.
	   Prosecutor Onofre Dulay said evidence showed Judge Elias Lelina
Jr. conspired with two men to force the girl to eat a drug-laced
dinner.
	   The girl claimed she was raped by Lelina after she felt dizzy
and lost consciousness.

American women swimmers defeat World All-Stars
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BILL BARNARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ There were big heroes and small
heroes for the U.S. women's swimming team.
	   The big heroes were Cristina Teuscher, Jenny Thompson and Leo
Maurer, who helped the U.S. team to a 65-57 victory over the World
All-Stars on Thursday night in the Goodwill Games dual meet.
	   The small ones were the younger swimmers who finished second and
third in five of the seven events the World All-Stars won.
	   ``It was a team effort because every single place counts in a
dual meet,'' said Maurer, 28, of Crestwood, New York, who won both
backstroke events and swam a leg on the medley relay.
	   But the United States had to win the final 400-meter freestyle
relay or it would have lost the meet, just as the U.S. men did in a
narrow loss to Germany the night before.
	   ``I am so spent,'' Thompson, a five-time Olympic gold medalist,
said after swimming anchor in the decisive event. ``The last 5
meters were fuzzy and in slow motion.''
	   But Thompson said the real hero was Teuscher, who won the 800
and 400 freestyles and swam an outstanding third leg on the final
relay.
	   ``I shouldn't be complaining,'' said Thompson, 25, of Dover, New
Hampshire, holding her cramping side. ``Cristina had a tougher
night and she did a tremendous job.''
	   ``At least it got easier as the night went on _ from 800 to 400
to 100,'' said Teuscher, of New Rochelle, New York. ``On relays,
the energy and momentum take over. But I was pretty nervous about
the three races I had to do.''
	   The dual meet victory over the All-Stars put the American women
on the inside track for the team gold medal.
	   Thompson swam the butterfly leg on the medley relay and won the
100 butterfly in the seventh-fastest time in history, just five
minutes before the freestyle relay.
	   No U.S. woman besides the three veterans won an individual
event.
	   But Richelle Fox of Scotia, New York, played a big role in the
freestyle relay. Swimming first, she took a one-second lead over
Rania Elwani of Egypt.
	   Sylvia Bereknyei of Pittsburgh, California, maintained a
half-second edge over Nadezhda Chemezova of Russia before Teuscher
completed her grueling night by extending the margin to 1.3 seconds
over Wilma Van Hofwegen of the Netherlands.
	   Martina Moravcova of Slovakia cut into the margin against
Thompson, but couldn't catch her. The times were 3 minutes, 45
seconds for the United States and 3:45.39 for the World team.
	   ``It was slow motion, but I made it to the wall,'' Thompson
said.
	   In the other dual meet Thursday, Germany defeated China 80-42,
the second straight defeat for the formerly formidable Chinese
women's team.
	   On Friday, the U.S. men face a World team, and Russia meets
Germany.

Kirby and Masakayan still around
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM O'CONNELL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It was only a few years ago that Karolyn Kirby
and Liz Masakayan dominated women's beach volleyball.
	   What they accomplished from 1993-95 is the benchmark for all
those competing in the sport. What they are doing in the Goodwill
Games is more inspirational than impressive, but it means the
longtime teammates are still winning.
	   Kirby, 37, and Masakayan, 33, beat Kristine Drakich and Guylaine
Dumont of Canada 15-5 Thursday to even their round-robin record at
1-1.
	   They close pool play on Friday against the top-seeded Brazilian
team of Shelda Bede and Adriana Behar. A win means moving on to the
medal round. A loss would be another bump in careers that have been
marked in recent years by injuries, operations and the frustration
of seeing your sport struggle in your own country.
	   ``It's probably the biggest match of our partnership so far
coming back together, and it's really going to challenge us,''
Kirby said of facing the Brazilians, who won both their matches.
``We know we have to step up to it. We have to step up our game,
our pace especially.''
	   Kirby and Masakayan were the ones everyone tried to step up to
in the mid-1990s. The two dominated the WPVA tour in the United
States, putting together a 55-match winning streak and taking 13
straight tournaments at one point. They won the gold medal in the
1994 Goodwill Games and it was in the finals of the world
championship that year that things started to turn.
	   Masakayan tore a knee ligament in that tournament and had to
have surgery. She snapped her kneecap nine months later, forcing
her sixth knee operation.
	   Kirby wasn't immune, as she had shoulder surgery in 1997.
	   In the interim, they played with different partners and watched
the U.S. pro league fold. Now they are together again, with a
chance of defending the Goodwill Games gold and rekindling memories
of a dominant time.
	   ``We're happy to be playing together again,'' Kirby said. ``It's
kind of nostalgic, having won the first Goodwill Games title.
Basically, we're just excited to be competing here.''
	   Things didn't start well as they lost to Australia 15-10 in the
opening match. On Thursday they jumped to a 7-1 lead over Canada
and closed the match by winning the last six points.
	   ``It was tough to rebound off yesterday's loss,'' Masakayan
said. ``It took time to heal. We knew we had to come back and
collect ourselves but it was still pretty devastating.''
	   But they were together.
	   ``We're a little older, a little wiser,'' Masakayan said.
``We're really happy to be here, looking forward to having another
long partnership again. We're looking long-term now.''
	   The other bracket has the U.S. team of Lisa Arce and Holly
McPeak. The second seeds won their first two matches and even a
loss to Germany today probably wouldn't keep them from moving on to
the semifinals.
	   Being the ``other'' U.S. team doesn't seem to bother Kirby and
Masakayan.
	   ``We're really happy to be playing together,'' Kirby said. ``We
really are.''

Deputy prime minister obtains court order against negative book
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's deputy prime minister
obtained a second court order Friday against a book which he says
is packed with defamatory lies against him.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim was granted the interim
injunction in High Court against the book, entitled, ``50 Reasons
Why Anwar Cannot Be Prime Minister.''
	   The book was authored by Khalid Jafri, a former editor of a
defunct tabloid newspaper, and published by Media Pulau Lagenda.
	   In granting him the injunction, High Court justice Wira Mohd.
Noor Ahmad ruled that the case contained issues of public interest
which ``overrode journalistic freedom,'' the national news agency
Bernama reported.
	   The judge also rejected the request made by the author and
publisher to dismiss the first injunction which Anwar obtained
against them on June 17.
	   Anwar had sought the second order to prohibit the book from
being distributed until the case was heard in court, Bernama said.
	   The book drew national attention after it was widely circulated
to top politicians attending the annual general assembly of
Malaysia's ruling party.
	   Anwar has often been a victim of privately circulated ``poison
pen'' letters alleging abuse of power and sexual misconduct. A book
was also published last year, titled ``Anwar Trapped,'' about
alleged sex scandals involving him.

Leonardo DiCaprio visits paralyzed Chinese gymnast
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NYR113 &QL; 
 &UR; By VERENA DOBNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In a single week, paralyzed Chinese gymnast Sang
Lan traded one dream for another _ gold in the Goodwill Games for a
golden hour with her movie idol, Leonardo DiCaprio.
	   On Thursday evening, just hours after the teen-ager arrived at a
clinic in New York City's Manhattan borough in an ambulance, the
``Titanic'' star appeared at her bedside.
	   The 17-year-old was transferred from Nassau County Medical
Center for what her family hopes will be the first step in a return
to athletic competition. But doctors warn she may never even walk
again.
	   Immobilized on a stretcher, with her parents walking alongside,
Sang was carried through a media horde into the Mount Sinai
Rehabilitation Institute.
	   Though unable to compete, the vivacious young woman quickly
revealed another desire earlier this week _ to meet DiCaprio. To
buoy her spirits, she kept his picture on a bulletin board in the
Long Island intensive care unit, along with cards from hundreds of
well-wishers.
	   The young Chinese woman even learned a few words of English _
just in case the 23-year-old movie star showed up.
	   On Thursday, presumably, she got to practice her ``Hi, how are
you?''
	   The details of her dream encounter are a bit of a secret for
now.
	   The actor did pay a private visit to Sang, according to a
one-sentence statement released by a public relations firm on his
behalf. The visit was confirmed by hospital spokesman Mel Granick,
who had no further information except to say the pair met for about
an hour.
	   Sang had been disappointed when told the movie ``Titanic''
wasn't yet available on video, but Paramount Pictures rushed to the
rescue, and a studio copy was on its way.
	   Sang, who was China's 1997 national vault champion, ``is
fascinated with American pop culture,'' said Shelley Lotenberg,
spokeswoman for Nassau County Medical Center, where she had stayed
since the accident early last week.
	   The teen-ager broke her neck during a Goodwill Games warmup
vault at the Nassau Coliseum. She underwent surgery Saturday, but
has little sensation from the chest down. Doctors have discounted
some toe movement as an involuntary twitch.
	   Still, her spirits were high.
	   ``I am so happy. I feel no more pain in my neck,'' she told a
Chinese reporter earlier this week at the hospital in East Meadow.
	   At Mount Sinai, she will benefit from ``one of the few model
spinal cord injury centers in the United States,'' said Dr. Brock
Schnebel, chief medical officer for the Goodwill Games. However, he
said in a statement, ``there has been no change in Sang Lan's
neurological condition.''
	   In addition to physical treatment _ including an experimental
nerve-building drug _ the teen-ager will get moral support from
Chinese staff doctors and students at the hospital in Manhattan.
	   ``We're going to translate for her. And we can give her another
kind of care _ make her feel she's not alone,'' said Dr. Jian Dong
of Mount Sinai.
	   She also has the company of 1,000 paper birds _ symbols of that
many wishes for a quick recovery from her friends in China. The
birds flew from her homeland with her parents, who arrived
Saturday.
	   ``I am sure she will be back to the competition circle because
she is very courageous, and with the excellent medical (care), the
doctors and hospitals in America,'' her father, Sang Shisheng, said
earlier in the week.
	   For the next several weeks, Sang will learn to ``optimize her
physical skills ... and enhance her transition back to everyday
activities,'' Granick said in an earlier statement.
	   It was at Mount Sinai that New York Jets football player Dennis
Byrd was treated for a paralyzing spinal cord injury he suffered
during a game six years ago. The defensive end's recovery was
termed ``miraculous.''

Australia says U.S. pledged to not undercut Indonesian wheat market
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Subs lead and adds new grafs 9-12 to explain that 1.5 million
tons of wheat committed to Indonesia, another million tons is not
yet allocated.
 &UR; With BC-Australia-US-Myanmar
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The United States has promised not to
let a donation of 1.5 million tons of wheat to Indonesia undercut
Australia's export market there, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer
said Friday.
	   The U.S. wheat donation _ almost exactly the amount Australia
used to sell to its northern neighbor _ was the major irritant in
otherwise amicable talks between top U.S. and Australian political
and defense officials Friday.
	   After meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
Downer said she had given an assurance that the U.S. wheat donation
will not impact Australia's sales of wheat to Indonesia.
	   ``The Americans have given us an undertaking that their
development assistance program for Indonesia wouldn't, in the area
of wheat, cut across our commercial wheat market,'' Downer said.
	   ``The fact that they have said that they would be prepared to
quarantine the commercial market from any development assistance is
heartening news.
	   ``If the details of that can be worked satisfactorily we'll
regard that as important progress,'' he added.
	   ``We have got to make sure there isn't dumping (of wheat), but
that this is entirely legitimate development assistance to help
with food shortages in Indonesia and that the commercial market
isn't disrupted,'' he said.
	   U.S. and Australian officials are to meet in Washington later to
work out details of honoring the pledge.
	   President Clinton said two weeks ago that the government was
buying 2.5 million tons of wheat to push up prices and help
American farmers. He said the wheat would be donated to countries
such as Indonesia, which has been hit by economic and civil
turmoil.
	   The United States plans to send 500,000 tons of wheat to
Indonesia with another million tons more to come based on need, the
Australian Wheat Board said Friday.
	   Australia exported about 2.5 million tons of wheat to Indonesia,
with a market value of about U.S. dlrs 310-370 million dollars
(500-600 million Australian dollars) a year, it said.
	   Trade and Deputy Foreign Minister Tim Fischer on Thursday said
the United States has a total of 2.5 million tons of wheat intended
for the dual purposes of humanitarian aid and ``export
penetration'' into Indonesia.
	   Downer said the atmosphere at the talks was friendly, but
Australia ``had out'' its case forcibly.
	   Australia had donated food aid through the World Food Program,
which was converted into rice, which Downer said was the most
pressing need in Indonesia, not wheat.
	   He said U.S. officials agree that some 80-100 million
Indonesians are now living in poverty, and 20 million do not have
enough food.

Castro reconciles with Jamaican enemy in Caribbean rapprochement

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Seeking to capitalize on newfound
support among Caribbean leaders, Fidel Castro told a rally of
thousands of Jamaicans that almost four decades of U.S. trade
sanctions were aimed at trying to starve Cuba's children.
	   The Cuban leader also railed against U.S. economic policies he
said have caused factories to leave the Caribbean, costing the
region thousands of jobs and threatening the limited trade of small
islands.
	   The sanctions against Cuba, he said, are more severe than any
measures taken against Central American governments that caused the
disappearance of tens of thousands of people, or those imposed on
South Africa's apartheid regime.
	   Castro said the U.S. trade embargo _ ``the enemy'' _ ``is trying
to kill our children by starvation.''
	   Jabbing the air as he spoke and punctuating jokes with a lift of
his bushy eyebrows, Castro spoke for more than two hours Thursday
night, the second day of a six-day tour that will take him from
Jamaica to Barbados and Grenada. The three countries once shunned
him but now are leading a campaign to soften the U.S. position on
Cuba.
	   ``Jamaica will continue to give the fullest support in ensuring
Cuba's re-integration within the hemispheric system,'' Prime
Minister P.J. Patterson told the rally.
	   ``The forces that pull us together are much stronger than the
forces that would seek to drive us apart,'' he said, indicating he
would not give in to U.S. pressure to isolate Castro and Cuba. The
U.S. sanctions date back to the early 1960s.
	   At the rally, which marked the reopening of the refurbished
Nelson Mandela Park, Patterson praised Castro's role in fighting
white South Africa's apartheid system.
	   Castro noted that the South African president _ a hero here _
has ``accused the president of the United States and scolded him
for the policy of blockading Cuba.''
	   Such solidarity, he said, was the only way for small nations to
stand up for their rights against a trend of globalization that
favors large blocs.
	   Castro maintained that the North American Free Trade Agreement,
which links the United States, Canada and Mexico, had robbed the
Caribbean of more than 100,000 jobs and 150 garment factories. Many
of the companies relocated to Mexico, which offers cheaper labor as
well as tariff-free access to the U.S. market.
	   He also criticized the United States for attacking the preferred
treatment that Caribbean banana exports enjoy in the European
Union, a trade arrangement that is a boon especially for islands
dependent on their banana trade.
	   ``Countries with different degrees of development cannot be
treated equally. ... It would not be fair, it would not be
humane,'' he said to cheers.
	   He dismissed the Geneva-based World Trade Organization _ which
has ruled that Europe's preferential treatment for Caribbean
bananas constituted unfair trading _ as a puppet of Washington.
	   Castro recalled when Cuba was truly isolated _ in the years
after his 1959 revolution, when every country in the hemisphere
except Canada and Mexico broke diplomatic ties. It was Caribbean
nations, led by Jamaica, among others that led the fight to help
restore Cuba's links to the rest of the world, he said.

Cops suspended after burglar saws through handcuffs to escape
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai thief, arrested and being
treated for gunshot wounds, sawed through the chain holding him to
his hospital bed and escaped while police guarding him ran personal
errands, The Nation newspaper reported Friday.
	   The two policeman who left the thief unattended have been
temporarily suspended, the paper said.
	   The burglar was shot in the leg by police as he attempted to
steal a motorcycle on Monday. He apparently cut through the chain
with a saw given him by his wife who visited him in the hospital.

Two losses have All Blacks in relaxed frame of mind
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand winger Jeff Wilson
says two consecutive losses have the All Blacks in a relaxed mood
going into Saturday's Bledisloe Cup and Tri Nations rugby union
test against Australia.
	   Wilson said Friday that good vibes in camp indicated the All
Blacks would put together a winning game after consecutive defeats
against the Australians and South Africa.
	   He said the high public expectation traumatized the All Blacks
in the week leading up to their 13-3 loss to the Springboks last
Saturday at Wellington.
	   The pressure, he said, had eased this week.
	   ``It's been so much better,'' Wilson said. ``There seems to be a
lot more positive vibes.''
	   ``We've started to realize that as much as passionate New
Zealanders are about rugby, it's not the end of the world. I think
the public can see now that we're not far away from bouncing right
back.''
	   The match will mark a milestone for three All Blacks, with
Wilson, 24, playing his 50th match, lock Ian Jones his 75th test
and 100th match and Walter Little his 50th test and 75th game.
	   ``I think we were a bit uptight in Wellington and perhaps in
Melbourne too,'' said Wilson. ``That's because there was so much
pressure we put on ourselves, and from the public expectation.
	   ``It looked like we were trying to grind out a test match win
rather than playing our game and using the abilities we've got.
That's what we've worked on this week.''
	   Wilson said All Blacks openside flanker Mark Carter and Wallaby
winger Jason Little, stepping in for the injured Josh Kronfeld and
Ben Tune respectively, were bringing their own strengths into the
game.
	   ``Josh is obviously the premier No. 7 in the world, but I think
Mark Carter will offer us different things. Jason will do the same
but it doesn't mean these Australians are not the favorites going
into this test match because they're playing so well.''
	   History is stacked against the Wallabies _ Australia has not won
in Christchurch for 40 years and that was only a narrow 6-3 result.
Only three Australian teams have won at the ground.
	   Australia hasn't won in New Zealand since 1990 when hooker Phil
Kearns rejoiced in the face of his great enemy Sean Fitzpatrick
after scoring the game's only try in Wellington. The Wallabies won
the game 21-9.
	   But since then, they have lost six times in New Zealand and have
not held the Bledisloe Cup since winning the one-off test in Sydney
in 1994.
	   The teams:
	   NEW ZEALAND: Christian Cullen, Jeff Wilson, Mark Mayerhofler,
Jonah Lomu, Walter Little, Andrew Mehrtens, Justin Marshall, Taine
Randell (captain), Mark Carter, Ian Jones, Robin Brooke, Michael
Jones, Olo Brown, Anton Oliver, Craig Dowd. Reserves: Scott McLeod,
Carlos Spencer, Ofisa Tonu'u, Scott Robertson, Royce Willis, Carl
Hoeft, Mark Hammett.
	   AUSTRALIA: Matt Burke, Jason Little, Daniel Herbert, Joe Roff,
Tim Horan, Steve Larkham, George Gregan, Toutai Kefu, David Wilson,
John Eales (captain), Tom Bowman, Matt Cockbain, Andrew Blades,
Phil Kearns, Dan Crowley. Reserves: Chris Whitaker, Nathan Grey,
Damian Smith, Willie Ofahenguae, Owen Finegan, Glen Panoho, Jeremy
Paul.
	   Referee: Derek Bevan (Wales).

Mob attacks discotheques suspected of sheltering prostitutes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of people attacked
discotheques in a mountain resort, accusing the night spots of
sheltering prostitutes and allowing illegal drug transactions,
police said Friday.
	   The Thursday morning assault in Puncak, 80 kilometers (50 miles)
southeast of Jakarta, caused damage to 16 discotheques.
	   Five people were detained for interrogation but were released
later, a police officer said by telephone. He put the number of
attackers at more than 200.
	   News reports quoted witnesses as saying a mob stoned the
nightclubs after being encouraged by a group of unidentified
motorcyclists, who later fled.
	   Lt. Col. Ferial Manaf, police chief in the nearby city of Bogor,
said local residents had long objected to the discotheques and
nightclubs in the area.
	   Many residents suspect the places are havens of prostitution and
illegal drug transactions. They have also complained that the loud
music from clubs that were open all night disturbed the Muslim dawn
prayer.

Ukrainian official says IMF mission to recommend loan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A visiting team from the International
Monetary Fund was expected to recommend the release of a badly
needed dlrs 2.5 billion loan for Ukraine, a senior official said
Friday.
	   Economics Minister Vasyl Rohovoi said the IMF team found that
Ukraine had implemented most of the fund's preconditions for the
disbursement of the loan _ including budget cuts, tax changes and
measures to increase revenues.
	   If the recommendation is positive, the IMF board likely to meet
in August or September to make a final decision on the three-year
loan, Rohovoi said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The IMF mission met Ukrainian officials this week to assess the
country's financial situation. The IMF mission chief Mohammad
Shadman-Valavi said Tuesday there were ``significant successes'' in
economic reform, but several issues remained to be decided.
	   Ukrainian officials said the outstanding questions concerned
changes in the value-added tax law, excise taxes, import and export
tariffs and the new 1998 budget.
	   Approval of the loan is crucial for Ukraine. The country owes
dlrs 18 billion in foreign debt _ including about dlrs 450 million
due in August alone _ and is chronically short of cash.
	   In addition, Ukraine's hryvna currency has been under pressure
in recent months because of foreign investors have been withdrawing
from the country's financial market.
	   The government has approved dozens of economic measures since
May, trying to meet requirements set by the IMF. Last year, the
fund refused to release a similar loan because of Ukraine's stalled
economic reforms, and it suspended aid for Kiev in the spring.
	   The government's measures included a new budget draft which
reduces the deficit. Parliament has failed to rule on the draft,
and Cabinet leaders said the draft would be offered to President
Leonid Kuchma within days to be signed and implemented by a
presidential decree.
	   Ukrainian officials say the IMF loan, if released, would be used
primarily to replenish the National Bank's reserves. They also hope
that renewed cooperation with the IMF would restore foreign
investors' confidence in Ukraine and let the former Soviet republic
borrow abroad at lower interest rates.

<TEXT>
	   In Toronto, Juan Guzman, expecting to be traded at any moment,
pitched eight shutout innings as Toronto beat Texas.
	   Guzman (6-12) allowed five hits, struck out three and walked
three while throwing 106 pitches. Randy Myers, also rumored to be
on the trading block, pitched the ninth for his 26th save.
	   Shannon Stewart singled home the game's only run in the fifth
inning against Esteban Loaiza (0-2) after Darrin Fletcher singled
and moved up on a grounder.
 &UR; Yankees 3, Angels 0, 10 innings
	   In Anaheim, California, Tino Martinez singled home two runs
after Rich De Lucia walked the bases loaded in the 10th inning and
New York outlasted Anaheim.
	   Derek Jeter, Paul O'Neill and Bernie Williams all got free
passes from De Lucia (1-4), who has walked 32 batters in 50 2-3
innings. Mike Holtz relieved and got ahead of Martinez 0-2, but
Martinez lined his next delivery just inside of first base.
	   Chad Curtis added a sacrifice fly for New York's third run.
	   The victory went to Ramiro Mendoza (6-2), who allowed two hits
over two innings after replacing starter Andy Petitte. Mariano
Rivera worked the 10th for his 28th save.
 &UR; Indians 9, Mariners 8, 17 innings
	   In Seattle, with Randy Johnson watching the whole five hours and
23 minutes from the bench on possibly his last night in a Seattle
uniform, Manny Ramirez led Cleveland to a 9-8 victory with a
three-run homer in the 17th inning.
	   Ramirez hit his 24th homer over the center field fence off Bob
Wells (0-2), the sixth Seattle pitcher, after Omar Vizquel singled
and moved to second on a groundout and Jim Thome was walked
intentionally.
	   Paul Shuey (3-1), Cleveland's seventh pitcher, got the victory
by pitching the final 2 1-3 innings. He allowed two runs in the
bottom of the 17th and faced a one-out, bases-loaded situation, but
ended the game by getting a groundout and a strikeout.

Ex-spy agents convicted in smear campaign against President Kim
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A court sentenced six people on
Friday, including a Korean-American businessman, to up to two years
in prison for plotting to destroy President Kim Dae-jung's election
campaign last year.
	   The six included five former officials of the main government
spy agency, which was accused of having tried to disrupt Kim's
presidential campaign last December by depicting him as a
communist.
	   After his inauguration in February, Kim, the first opposition
candidate to win presidential election in South Korea, ordered a
thorough probe of the alleged smear campaign.
	   Lee Dae-sung, an assistant minister-level official at the Agency
for National Security Planning, was sentenced to two years in
prison for hiring a Korean-American businessman to hold news
conferences to make a false claims that Kim's election campaign was
funded by North Korea.
	   The Korean-American businessman, Yoon Hong-joon, 32, also was
sentenced to a two-year jail term for violating election laws.
	   Yoon, a frequent traveler to North Korea, was paid dlrs 250,000
by the spy agency to hold news conferences in Beijing, Tokyo and
Seoul ahead of the presidential election, prosecutors said.
	   The alleged smear campaign hurt Kim's popularity. He won the
election by only 300,000 votes.
	   Four lower-ranking government spy agents, who worked with Lee,
were given suspended prison terms.
	   A total of 13 people, including the agency's ex-chief, Kwon
Young-hae, were arrested in the case. Kwon and six other agency
officials are being tried separately.
	   All testified in court that they became involved in the smear
campaign on Kwon's order.
	   South Korea remains staunchly anti-communist after fighting a
war with North Korea in 1950-53. Under South Korea's past
authoritarian governments, the spy agency often portrayed
dissidents or political opponents as communists to destroy their
careers.

Roche says EU approves obesity drug
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss pharmaceutical firm Roche said
Friday the European Union has approved its obesity treatment drug
Xenical.
	   The drug will be launched in September in Germany, France,
Britain, Austria and Finland, and thereafter in the other 10 EU
countries, Roche said in a statement.
	   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has yet to approve
Xenical, which has already been introduced in parts of Asia and
Latin America.
	   In May, the FDA issued Roche an approvable letter for the
product. Roche needs to submit follow-up data on its ongoing
clinical studies of Xenical and work with the agency on labeling.
	   The drug is a ``lipase inhibitor,'' which works by helping
dieters absorb less fat from food and, unlike other obesity
products, acts in the intestine rather than the brain.
	   Taken with each meal, it disables certain pancreatic enzymes and
reduces fat absorption by some 30 percent.
	   The United States' 58 million overweight people spend dlrs 30
billion per year in the battle against fat.

French unemployment edges down to 11.8 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French unemployment continued its gradual descent,
falling to 11.8 percent in June from 11.9 percent the month before,
the National Statistics Institute said Friday.
	   The number of jobseekers fell by 23,000, or 0.75 percent, to
3.03 million, confirming a trend that economists expect will
continue until 1999.
	   Women under the age of 25 were the most successful group at
finding work, with a drop of 0.2 percent in jobseekers, at 26.5
percent compared with 26.7 percent in May.
	   In its campaign to reduce unemployment, the French government in
1997 introduced a program to hire more young people.
	   The French government aims to create 300,000 jobs in 1998 and
had set a target of between 11.7 percent and 11.8 percent
unemployment.

Newspaper report: new clues in SilkAir crash suicide theory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A last-minute life insurance policy for a
debt-ridden captain, a prior incident of erasing a cockpit tape,
and an eerie coincidence were cited Friday in a newspaper report
suggesting a suicidal pilot caused the December SilkAir crash.
	   The Asian Wall Street Journal reported that Capt. Tsu Way Ming,
the Singaporean pilot of the SilkAir jet that crashed Dec. 19 over
Sumatra, killing all 104 people aboard, had taken out an insurance
policy on his life just days before the crash.
	   It was worth several million dollars, the report said. The
captain, who left behind his widow and three children, is reported
to have been heavily in debt from speculating on securities, the
newspaper said, citing unidentified investigators and people close
to the crash probe for the details in its report.
	   One of the most puzzling aspects of the Boeing 737 crash is that
the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder stopped working
minutes before impact. Without those last moments of information,
there is no clue as to what the crew and the aircraft were doing in
the moments before it plunged at supersonic speed into a Sumatran
river.
	   Investigators have announced publicly that the engine was still
running as it hit the ground, a scenario that could be explained if
the nose had been aimed downward to deliberately crash the plane.
	   Suggestions that the troubled Tsu may have committed suicide,
and covered it up by turning off the cockpit's recorders, were
first raised by Aviation Week magazine early this year and have
been followed up by other newspapers. Indonesian, Singaporean and
American investigators have refused to publicly confirm most of the
details in the reports.
	   The Journal reported that Tsu had recently erased the cockpit
voice recorder in an aircraft to cover up a mistake. The action
caused the co-pilot in that previous incident to make a formal
complaint, leading to Tsu's demotion and ruining his chances to
move up to SilkAir's prestigious and better-paying parent company,
Singapore Airlines, the Journal reported.
	   The Journal reported that Tsu could have disabled the recorders
on the fatal SilkAir flight at a panel in the back of the cockpit,
unseen by co-pilot Duncan Ward of New Zealand, if he was flying at
the time.
	   Finally, the Journal reported, Dec. 19 _ the day of the SilkAir
crash _ was the same day that three of Tsu's flying buddies in the
Singapore Air Force had died smashing into a Philippine
mountainside during an acrobatic training mission 18 years before.
Because of a mechanical problem, Tsu had turned back, and thus
survived that mission.
	   While 80 percent of the SilkAir jet has been recovered,
investigators have reported no indication of a bomb, and no
apparent malfunction.

	   ANTALYA, Turkey (AP) _ A U.S. crewman injured during a fatal
crash between two navy jets over the Mediterranean was in stable
condition Friday following a three-hour operation, hospital
officials said.
	   The airman, identified by University Hospital in Antalya as
William Kane, underwent surgery for a broken leg and was expected
to be discharged within three days, said Dr. Ahmet Turan Aydin, who
performed the operation.
	   After Thursday's collision, one of the two F-14 Tomcats made it
safely back to the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower. But
the other crashed while flying to Antalya for an emergency landing,
said Lt. Greg Geisen, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy's public
affairs office in Gaeta, Italy.
	   The two crew members in the plane that crashed ejected, Geisen
said. When a rescue helicopter located the pair, one aviator was
unconscious and the other had a serious leg injury.
	   The unconscious aviator was flown back to the Eisenhower, where
medical staff declared him dead. His identity has not been
disclosed and it was not clear when he would be repatriated.
	   The U.S. Embassy has obtained Turkish authorization for a guided
missile cruiser to begin searching for the plane wreckage to try to
identify the cause of the crash, an embassy official said on
condition of anonymity. The crash occurred about 10 miles (16
kilometers) off the coast, in Turkish territorial waters.
	   The USS Eisenhower, which is based in Norfolk, Virginia, and had
been in the Mediterranean just over a month, was 150 miles (240
kilometers) southwest of Antalya at the time of the crash.

Government bans last exemption for land mine use
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's ban on land mines will become total with
the elimination of an exemption for ``exceptional circumstances,''
the government said Friday.
	   On July 10, under pressure to show support for Princess Diana's
final campaign against land mines before the anniversary of her
death Aug. 31, the House of Commons rushed through a bill ratifying
the international treaty banning their use.
	   But it will not come into effect for some months, until at least
40 of the more than 120 signatories have ratified it.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's government had imposed a moratorium
on the operational use of anti-personnel land mines by British
forces in May. An exemption was allowed for the weapons' use in
exceptional circumstances, such as to defend an occupied zone.
	   Defense Secretary George Robertson said Friday that a total ban
was being implemented to send a ``clear signal'' to the rest of the
world.
	   Robertson, speaking to BBC radio before making a formal
announcement to Parliament, said a concerted effort must be made to
get countries that have not signed the convention to do so.
	   Removing the exemption would reinforce Britain's position, he
said.
	   ``We will wipe that away now to make sure that a very clear
signal goes out to the rest of the world,'' he told BBC.
	   ``We must now go out there and use Britain's moral authority to
make sure that our position becomes the international standard,''
he said.
	   More than 120 countries signed the treaty, known as the Ottawa
Convention, in the Canadian capital in December, but would not come
into force for at least another nine months. It has to be ratified
by a minimum of 40 countries.
	   Half of Britain's one million landmines have already been
destroyed.

 &UR; Eds: Moves up opposition reaffirmation against coalition, updates
with Ranariddh's departure in grafs 4-5; edits thruout &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBIN McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A new controversy threatened to
erupt Friday over Cambodia's election results as reports circulated
that a new, little-known formula to determine the allocation of the
winners' parliamentary seats would favor the ruling party of
strongman Hun Sen.
	   The apparent change in the rules became known as opposition
leaders reaffirmed their refusal to consider a coalition government
with Hun Sen while they were still disputing the results of last
Sunday's election.
	   The two parties had issued a statement Tuesday saying they were
prepared to boycott the National Assembly unless they were
satisfied that they had not been cheated in Sunday's polls. Without
the opposition's attendance, the assembly is unlikely to have the
two-thirds of its 122 members needed to conduct any business.
	   After meeting with Sam Rainsy in the morning, Ranariddh later
caught a plane for Bangkok, his base of operations for almost a
year after he was deposed in a July 1997 coup d'etat by Hun Sen,
then his co-premier.
	   His aides would not give a reason for his trip, but said he
would return in a day or two.
	   News of the apparent change in the method of allocating seats
first emerged Thursday afternoon when the top independent
monitoring group, the Committee for Free and Fair Elections in
Cambodia _ COMFREL _ revised its projections to give Hun Sen's
Cambodian People's Party 64 parliamentary seats, FUNCINPEC 43 and
the Sam Rainsy Party 15.
	   Its earlier projection, based on an unofficial count of 90
percent of the ballots counted, showed the ruling CPP getting 59
seats, FUNCINPEC 45 and the Sam Rainsy Party 18.
	   The change is crucial without the extra seats CPP would fall
short of having even a simple majority in parliament.
	   COMFREL head Thun Saray explained Friday his group had been
informed Thursday afternoon of a second official method to
calculate seat allocations, replacing a widely circulated method
issued earlier.
	   He said the first method of calculation under the highest
average system appeared to be more fair, and added that the
government's National Election Committee told him the new formula
was adopted in April.
	   Opposition politician Sam Rainsy blasted the apparent change in
rules as ``unfair, arbitrary and unconstitutional.''
	   ``It is not in the election law and the NEC cannot change just
like this the formula at the last minute,'' he said.
	   Asked about the existence of a new formula at a news briefing
Friday, a National Election Committee spokesman did not answer
directly, saying that the committee would not do anything against
the law.
	   An independent observer. Peter Schier of Germany's
democracy-promoting Konrad Adenauer Foundation, said he was also
caught by surprise.
	   ``Apparently not many people know about the new formula except
the NEC and a few experts,'' he said. ``I thought I understood a
lot about the election here but frankly I was surprised to find out
only after all the votes had been taken and counted about the new
method.''
	   He said the published election regulations issued May 25, the
day campaigning began, specified the original seat-allocating
formula.
	   The National Election Committee has so far released complete
results of last Sunday's poll from just 16 of the country's 23
provincial constituencies, giving only the number of popular votes
with no indication of seats won.
	   Hun Sen met Thursday with King Norodom Sihanouk in the
northwestern town of Siem Reap, and afterwards claimed to reporters
to have won royal approval for his proposal to form a coalition
government, under which he will still hold all the important levers
of power.
	   Though Sihanouk is largely a figurehead, his popularity among
many Cambodians and high international profile make his blessing a
vital step for Hun Sen to win back international legitimacy and aid
lost last year by staging his coup.
	   Hun Sen said Wednesday that if the opposition carries out its
threat not to attend the National Assembly, he could lower the
constitutional minimum for the assembly to meet and confirm a
government from two-thirds to 50 percent plus one. He also said his
current government could remain in power.
	   Amnesty International on Friday urged strongman Hun Sen to keep
his security forces from terrorizing members of the opposition in
the post-election period.
	   The human rights situation in Cambodia has deteriorated since
Hun Sen apparently won the parliamentary polls, triggering
retribution by forces loyal to his Cambodian People's Party against
those who had challenged him.
	   Scores of supporters of Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC
party and the Sam Rainsy Party have fled Cambodia's rural areas to
Phnom Penh, seeking refuge at their parties' headquarters.

Two Russian policemen killed in checkpoint attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Gunmen opened fire with automatic weapons at a
police checkpoint in the Caucasus region of southern Russia on
Friday, killing two policemen and one civilian, news agencies
reported.
	   The unidentified attackers fired from a truck in North Ossetia,
wounding two other policemen as well. They then headed for the
nearby republic of Ingushetia, Interfax said.
	   North Ossetia, a Christian region, fought a short but bloody war
in 1992 with Ingushetia, which is largely Muslim. Hundreds of
people were killed and most ethnic Ingush were expelled from North
Ossetia.
	   Both sides have blamed each other for numerous kidnappings since
then.
	   The two republics are located in the mountainous northern
Caucasus, an unstable region that also includes breakaway Chechnya.

Dead dogs found in canal leading into Sydney water system

 &UR; Eds: Updates with federal sports minister calling Sydney's water
``poisonous.''

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Dead dogs have been found in a canal
running into the water treatment plant that pumped
parasite-polluted water throughout Sydney, forcing millions to boil
water to drink, the state urban affairs minister said Friday.
	   Fleets of trucks rushed through the streets delivering bottled
water to businesses, schools, hospitals and homes as Sydney's 3.7
million residents were warned to boil their drinking water to make
it safe. Bottled water vanished off store shelves as customers
bought a half-dozen or more bottles each.
	   The anger of Sydney residents was also boiling as they demanded
to know how the parasites giardia and cryptosporidium spread
through the city's water system.
	   No illness has been reported so far as a result of the
contamination, but the parasites have an incubation period of about
a week.
	   In 1993, 100 people died in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in an outbreak
of cryptosporidium in the city's drinking water. More than 400,000
others got sick.
	   The tainted water prompted fears that Sydney's reputation has
been damaged ahead of the 2000 Olympic Games, for which Sydney is
the host.
	   ``Having gone to the trouble of winning the Olympics, the very
least a state government could do is make sure that the water is
not poisonous,'' federal Sports Minister Andrew Thompson said.
	   ``Of course it's embarrassing,'' Prime Minister John Howard told
a radio station. ``It's one of those unexpected things and
everybody here's hoping it will be fixed up as soon as possible.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Secretary of
Defense William Cohen arrived Thursday with a contingent of
American reporters, to be greeted by Intercontinental Hotel
bellhops informing them the tap water is not safe to drink.
	   The two officials are in Australia for annual consultations
Friday with their counterparts here.
	   This is the second major urban infrastructure failure this year
in the region.
	   A power failure struck downtown Auckland in February, plunging
the commercial heart of New Zealand's largest city into darkness.
Sporadic power failures and electricity shortages continued for
five weeks.
	   Several dead dogs were found in an open canal running into the
water treatment plant that has been pinpointed as the source of the
contamination, Urban Affairs Minister Craig Knowles said.
	   ``How they've got in there, goodness only knows, but they've
either fallen in or been thrown in by uncaring owners,'' Knowles
told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio on Friday.
	   But Sydney Water managing director Chris Pollett said he doubted
a few dead animals could have caused the citywide problem, and said
it was more likely that the parasites were generally present in
water running into the system.
	   He said the water system was being flushed and he hoped the tap
water would be safe to drink in 48 hours.
	   Water mains have been opened, and water gushed down curbs as the
system was flushed.
	   Meanwhile, city residents must boil water for at least 60
seconds _ and preferably for three minutes _ to avoid the
parasites.
	   Giardia, normally spread from human or animal fecal matter, can
cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems.
	   Cryptosporidium causes symptoms similar to flu. It can kill
people with weak immune systems, such as the elderly, patients
recovering from surgery and victims weakened by other diseases.
	   New South Wales State Premier Bob Carr vowed to fire those
responsible but played down damage to the Olympic city's
reputation.
	   ``It's got nothing to do with the Olympics, it's got to do with
being able to drink water from a tap knowing you're not in danger
of getting a stomach bug,'' he told reporters.
	   Sydney Water had previously been so proud of its water supply
that it ran ad campaigns featuring prominent Olympic athletes
endorsing its purity.
	   State opposition leader Peter Collins said Sydney's reputation
was on the line because of the contamination.
	   ``Two years out from the Olympics, we get a reputation for being
a city whose water supply has to be boiled before you can drink
it,'' Collins said.
	   ``If this was Dakar (Senegal) after the flood, you might
understand it but how has this been allowed to happen in Sydney?''

Myanmar government says protest leaflets circulating in Yangon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Anti-government and pro-democracy groups
have been distributing leaflets in the Myanmar capital of Yangon
calling for an uprising against military rule, the state-run New
Light of Myanmar reported Friday.
	   The paper warned citizens to ``beware of the instigations by the
axe-handles,'' the government's term for traitors.
	   Myanmar has been ruled by the military since 1962. Opposition
groups in exile in Thailand and other countries have said they will
try to agitate against the military as the 10th anniversary of a
nationwide democracy uprising approaches.
	   The military crushed the Aug. 8, 1988 uprising by gunning down
thousands of protesters. The military claims hundreds of its
intelligence officers and policemen were killed by angry mobs.
	   ``The underground cells in Yangon in collusion with the exiled
All Burma Students Democratic Front terrorist groups have been
distributing anti-government pamphlets through mail, telephone and
dropping leaflets from commuter buses in Yangon recently,'' the
paper said.
	   The ABSDF is a pro-democratic group of former students who fled
Myanmar, also known as Burma, when the army unleashed its firepower
against the populace in 1988.
	   A few hundred of them are still fighting against the military in
the jungles of eastern Myanmar, and the government regularly labels
them as terrorists.

Report: Mushrooms poison 194 in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - At least 194 Ukrainians, many of them
children, have suffered from mushroom poisoning so far this year
and six people have died, a newspaper said Friday.
	   In the capital Kiev alone, 24 poisoning cases were registered
over the period, Kievskiye Vedomosti said.
	   Mushroom hunting is extremely popular during the summer and
autumn months in the former Soviet Union _ and poisoning cases are
quite common.
	   Ukrainian doctors have warned against picking mushrooms. Some
poisoning cases have involved poisonous mushrooms mistaken for
edible ones and some of the victims gathered edible mushrooms, but
in polluted areas.
	   Health authorities have also urged people to avoid buying
mushrooms at outdoors markets, saying that some of them were
gathered in areas affected by radioactive fallout from the 1986
Chernobyl nuclear disaster.
	   A total of 4,578 people have suffered from mushroom poisoning in
Ukraine in 1997-98 and 266 of them died, including 97 children,
according to official figures.

Former senior Chinese leader sentenced to 16 years imprisonment

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ In a verdict that confirmed corruption at the
highest ranks of the Chinese government, a former Communist Party
leader was sentenced Friday to 16 years imprisonment for his part
in China's biggest graft scandal.
	   Chen Xitong, a former mayor and party boss of Beijing, is the
most senior leader to be prosecuted in a five-year-old
anti-corruption campaign that has seen hundreds of thousands of
officials disciplined and many, including Chen's son, jailed.
	   Before his disgrace, Chen rubbed shoulders with the likes of
Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin as one of just 20 members of the
party's elite Politburo, the apex of Chinese political power.
	   Many Chinese had believed Chen was too powerful to prosecute.
But in deciding to punish him, his former colleagues appear to have
judged the need to be seen as tackling graft to outweigh the risk
that exposing Chen might further blacken the party's
corruption-tainted image.
	   Abuses, ranging from doctors who take bribes for their services
to officials who steal from the public purse, have become so
widespread and so offensive to ordinary Chinese that communist
leaders admit that their monopoly on power may hinge on wiping out
corruption.
	   Since October 1992, the Communist Party has expelled more than
121,500 officials and investigated hundreds of thousands of others
for such misdeeds as bribery, embezzlement and even feasting at
public expense.
	   Making an example of Chen, state-run media announced his
conviction shortly after the Beijing Municipal Higher People's
Court passed sentence Friday morning.
	   Chen was sentenced to 13 years imprisonment for corruption and
to four years for dereliction of duty, but will serve a total of 16
years, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said.
	   The court also ordered that bribes Chen accepted should be
confiscated and handed over to the State Treasury, Xinhua said.
	   Chen can appeal the verdict in the next 10 days, but Xinhua did
not say if he would do so.
	   Reflecting the sensitivity of Chen's case, the state media
reports gave no details about his trial, such as whether he denied
the charges against him.
	   Chen had threatened to implicate other leaders if prosecuted,
according to Chinese sources with close ties to party leaders.
	   Chen's sentence was lighter than some of those handed down to
other, lower-ranked officials and it was unclear how far it would
go toward assuaging public anger over corruption. In a petition
last Sunday, four dissidents from northeast China had demanded the
death penalty for Chen.
	   Chen, 68, ran Beijing first as mayor and then as party secretary
from 1983 until he stepped down in 1995 after a vice mayor
committed suicide rather than face arrest for corruption.
	   Party investigators determined that Chen maintained ``a corrupt
and decadent life'' through embezzlement and the squandering of
public funds. The scandal, which involved dozens of officials, cost
Beijing as much as 18.3 billion yuan (more than dlrs 2 billion).
	   Chen was stripped of his Politburo seat in September 1995,
expelled from the party last September, and handed over to
prosecutors.
	   Not seen in public since the spring of 1995, Chen was rumored to
have been detained in Inner Mongolia or at a seaside mansion. Hong
Kong media recently reported Chen had been moved to a Beijing
hospital because of health problems.

Dollar rises, Tokyo stocks gain moderately
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: WRAPS up with late dollar, bond, other details

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Comments by Japan's new finance minister that
appeared to signal reluctance to intervene in currency markets sent
the dollar sharply higher against the yen Friday. Tokyo stock
prices gained moderately.
	   The dollar bought 143.78 yen in afternoon trading, up 1.48 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate
of 143.66 yen overnight.
	   The U.S. currency ranged between 143.45 yen and 143.87 yen in
Friday's trading.
	   Japan's newly appointed Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a
news conference Friday that the yen and stock markets should move
``on their own'' and intervention in foreign exchange markets
should occur only rarely.
	   Traders interpreted Miyazawa's remarks as indicating Japan's
central bank would be less likely to prop up the slumping yen, even
if it falls further.
	   Miyazawa attempted to play down his remark later in the day
saying it was just a statement of ``a general principle'' that
reflected ``common sense'' rather than a shift in policy.
	   Those comments briefly pushed the dollar lower against the yen,
but demand for the U.S. currency boosted it again in afternoon
trading.
	   Traders predicted, however, that Miyazawa's apparent
clarification would be enough to allow the yen to rebound.
	   ``Now that Miyazawa's clarification is out of the way, the
dollar will back off from its overnight highs,'' said Alfred
Patzner, head of currency trading at Bank Gesellschaft Berlin in
Frankfurt, as markets opened in Europe.
	   U.S. and Japanese monetary authorities sold dollars and bought
yen in a dramatic intervention June 17 to prop up the faltering
Japanese currency.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices rose on expectations
new Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's administration will carry out
permanent tax cuts and implement measures to write off massive bad
debts held by Japan's banks.
	   But the gains were tempered by uncertainty over what actions
Obuchi would take to boost the economy.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average finished the day at
16,378.97, up 177.37 points, or 1.09 percent. On Thursday, the
average closed up 43.51 points, or 0.27 percent.
	   ``Essentially, the cat's out of the bag; now let's see if it can
catch mice,'' said Louis Tseng, the head of derivatives at Jardine
Fleming Securities.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section rose 13.85 points, or 1.11 percent, to 1,262.85. The
TOPIX closed up 7.49 points, or 0.60 percent, the day before.
	   An estimated 379 million shares changed hands Friday on the
first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, up from 365 million on
Thursday.
	   Advances outnumbered declines 692 to 394, while 168 issues were
unchanged.
	   Traders were also encouraged by an overnight rise on Wall
Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 111.99 points
to 9,026.95.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.250 percent from Thursday's finish of
1.225 percent, driving its price down to 111.45 yen from 111.63
yen.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A man's legs, arms and entrails were found
stuffed in five sacks at a crowded Cairo bus stop, police said
Friday.
	   The bags were discovered Thursday by rush hour commuters at the
Abu el-Reesh bus stop in a medieval Islamic neighborhood, police
said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Forensic experts are examining the body parts to identify the
man, whose head and chest were missing. The torso had been hacked
in half and only the abdomen containing the intestines and the
stomach was found in the sacks.
	   Egypt witnessed a wave of similar murder a decade ago by wives
who were victims of rape, beatings and other abuse by their
husbands. The victims' mutilated bodies and body parts were
disposed of in plastic bags.

Bomb explosion kills police officer and injures a child

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ An early morning bomb
explosion killed a police officer and wounded a child in the
central Bosnian town of Travnik, local police said Friday.
	   Officers in the international police force, who along with local
officials are investigating the incident, said an unidentified
device exploded in a garbage container across from a joint
Muslim-Croat police station.
	   The blast killed officer Anto Valjan, who was returning from his
overnight shift as the device went off, and shattered windows on a
nearby building, wounding a child, said Franjo Grganovic local
chief of police.
	   Friday's is the fifth explosion in Bosnia this week.
	   Two bombs exploded the same day last week, one in Croat
controlled west Mostar in the south and the other in Muslim-held
Novi Travnik.
	   A few days later, an explosion damaged the Catholic church in
Kakanj, central Bosnia and the same day a handgranade went off in
the center of Sarajevo.
	   The previous explosions caused no casualties and no immediate
evidence linking the explosions was immediately available.
	   In the run-off to elections last year, such explosions were
frequent. Bosnians go to the polls again in September.

Housing starts in Japan fall for 18th straight month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's housing starts in June slumped 11.7 percent
from the same month last year _ the eighteenth straight month of
decline, the Construction Ministry said Friday.
	   Weak consumer confidence, hurt by rising unemployment and slack
demand for labor, was the main cause of the stubborn sluggishness
in housing starts, the ministry said.
	   The Economic Planning Agency announced Friday that unemployment
had soared to a record high 4.3 percent in June compared to 4.1
percent the previous month.
	   There were 106,715 housing starts in June. The figure fell 17.0
percent in May, 16.1 percent in April and 11.9 percent in March.
	   The ministry also said consumers are waiting to buy houses
because they expect the current super-low interest rates to be
maintained for now, and that rates are more likely to be cut
further than raised.
	   Japan's official discount rate has stood at the record-low 0.5
percent since September 1995.t

Taiwanese city council deputy found dead in northern China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A city council deputy from Taiwan has been found
dead in the northern Chinese town of Haicheng, a day after she was
reported kidnapped, police said Friday.
	   The body of Lin Ti-chuan, a member of southern Taiwan's
Kaohsiung city council, was discovered Thursday, said a policeman
from the Public Security Bureau in Anshan, a city near Haicheng in
Liaoning province.
	   Three employees of a Haicheng-based import-export firm have been
arrested in connection with her murder, said the policeman, who
only provided his surname, Chen.
	   Lin's body was dumped at a hospital where her abductors had
taken her Wednesday after giving her a drug overdose, her aides in
Taiwan said. Kidnappers apparently took her body back to the
hospital and left it there after she died, they said.
	   State radio in Taiwan said the suspects were thought to be
business associates of Lin's Taiwanese boyfriend, identified as Wei
Dan-kang.
	   Wei reported the kidnapping on Wednesday after he escaped from
abductors in the port of Dalian, also known as Luda. Police were
unable to locate Wei on Friday, Chen said.
	   The incident is the latest in a rising trend of violence towards
Taiwanese in China, where, like Lin, many have business dealings.
	   Taiwanese officials report the number of murders, kidnappings
and assaults on Taiwanese in China this year is on track to triple
the 27 incidents reported in 1997.
	   Those incidents have a searing affect on Taiwanese feelings
towards the mainland, and Lin's murder renewed concerns about crime
in China. Politicians from the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party, of which Lin was a member, urged Taiwanese on Friday to stop
investing in the mainland until China can ensure their safety.
	   Also on Friday, newspapers reported a Taiwanese businessman,
Wang Fu-ching, was found dead in the southern Chinese city of
Shenzhen after visiting there to negotiate with his local partners
about pulling out of an investment.
	   Since 1991, the Straits Exchange Foundation, a semiofficial body
handling exchanges with China, has handled 184 cases of Taiwanese
business people being kidnapped, intimidated, or facing extortion
threats, of whom 25 were killed.
	   Lawmakers of the ruling Nationalist Party urged China to discuss
guarantees for Taiwanese investments on the mainland and the safety
of investors in long-delayed talks.
	   The two sides have moved slowly to resume the dialogue Beijing
froze in 1995, but progress has been stalled because Beijing wants
to open political talks and Taiwan wants to focus on smaller,
practical matters first.
	   Taiwan is governed by the Nationalists, who fled to the island
after the communist takeover of mainland China in 1949.

<TEXT>
	   NEUCHATEL, Switerland (AP) _ Dutch team TVM pulled out of the
scandal-plagued Tour de France on Friday, reducing the field to
just 14 teams compared to 21 at the start.
	   Jean-Francois Pescheux, the Tour's sporting director, said the
team, at the center of the ongoing drug scandal, had informed him
of its withdrawal. Staff at the hotel where the team had been
staying said they left early Friday for the Netherlands.
	   ``The cyclists say they are tired and don't want to continue,''
Pescheux said. ``They're within their rights. We're a little
disappointed.''
	   The treatment of the TVM team on Tuesday night was the focal
point of the Tour riders' protest the following day that led to the
annulment of the 17th stage.
	   The TVM riders, suspected of drug abuse, were taken to hospital
by police and given lengthy medical tests including blood, urine
and hair tests.
	   After the pack stopped twice during the stage, the rest of the
leg proceeded slowly and the TVM riders were allowed to cross the
line first, raising their arms in victory.

IMF mission to recommend dlrs 2.2 billion loan for Ukraine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with mission to recommend loan, ADDS

 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A visiting team from the International
Monetary Fund will recommend the disbursement of a badly needed
dlrs 2.2 billion loan for Ukraine, the mission's chief said Friday.
	   ``We've reached a tentative agreement with Ukrainian authorities
on the program of stabilization and restructuring of the economy,''
said the official, Mohammed Shadman-Valavi.
	   Shadman-Valavi described the program as ``very ambitious.'' It
aims to reform the finance sector and reducing inflation, and end
years of economic decline.
	   The IMF has set a number of requirements for the former Soviet
republic to qualify for the three-year loan, and Shadman-Valavi's
team was meeting with Ukrainian officials this week to assess
Ukraine's compliance.
	   ``Members of the mission have positively assessed our work and
treated our problems with understanding. They also saw our
decisiveness in implementing economic reforms,'' Deputy Prime
Minister Serhiy Tyhypko told reporters.
	   ``This gives us grounds to hope that the IMF board of directors'
decision would be positive,'' Tyhypko added.
	   The mission's recommendation would be submitted to the board for
approval at a session expected to take place after Aug. 24,
Shadman-Valavi said. The figure he gave for the loan, dlrs 2.2
billion, was slightly lower than the dlrs 2.5 billion Ukraine had
hoped for.
	   Approval of the loan is crucial for Ukraine. The country owes
dlrs 18 billion in foreign debt _ including about dlrs 450 million
due in August alone _ and is chronically short of cash.
	   In addition, Ukraine's hryvna currency has been under pressure
in recent months because of foreign investors have been withdrawing
from the country's financial market.
	   The government has approved dozens of economic measures since
May, trying to meet requirements set by the IMF. Last year, the
fund refused to release a similar loan because of Ukraine's stalled
economic reforms, and it suspended aid for Kiev in the spring.
	   The government's measures included a new budget draft which
reduces the deficit. Parliament has failed to rule on the draft,
and Cabinet leaders said the draft would be offered to President
Leonid Kuchma within days to be signed and implemented by a
presidential decree.
	   Ukrainian officials say the IMF loan, if released, would be used
primarily to replenish the National Bank's reserves. They also hope
that renewed cooperation with the IMF would restore foreign
investors' confidence in Ukraine and let the former Soviet republic
borrow abroad at lower interest rates.

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Talks aimed at resolving longstanding
disputes between India and Pakistan failed Friday, with Pakistan
saying there was no basis for negotiations to resume.
	   ``It has not been possible to reach an agreement,'' Pakistan
spokesman Tariq Altaf told reporters in Colombo, where top foreign
office officials of both nations met Friday on orders of their
prime ministers. ``No basis exists for resumption of dialogue,'' he
said.
	   Indian officials were not immediately available for comment.
	   The high-ranking officials were trying to settle differences
dating back to the birth of their hostile neighboring nations more
than 50 years ago.
	   The diplomatic effort assumed even greater importance because it
followed the first meeting between the prime ministers of India and
Pakistan since the two countries conducted tit-for-tat nuclear
weapons tests in May. The tests sparked fears of a nuclear arms
race and war in South Asia.
	   The disputes between India and Pakistan revolve primarily around
Kashmir, the Himalayan border territory over which the countries
have fought two of their three wars since gaining independence from
Britain in 1947.
	   Meanwhile, Indian military officials in Kashmir said Friday that
16 people were killed during an exchange of artillery fire between
Pakistani and Indian troops overnight Thursday.
	   The officials at India's defense headquarters in Jammu said one
artillery shell slammed into a military hospital, killing 10
people.
	   Indian shells fired across the border also killed six Pakistani
civilians and four soldiers, military sources in Pakistan said.
	   Altaf's statement and similar comments by Pakistani Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif earlier Friday appeared to dampen hopes that
accompanied the first meeting between the Pakistani and Indian
leaders in a year. After the meeting, they ordered their respective
foreign ministries to find ways to continue stalled discussions on
disputes ranging from Kashmir to demarcating the boundary of a
lake.
	   ``The outcome so far is zero,'' Sharif said after Thursday's
meeting with Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, according
to the Sri Lankan newspaper The Island.
	   In the newspaper interview published Friday, Sharif accused
India of dragging its feet on Kashmir, which, he called the core
issue between the neighboring nations.
	   The Indian government did not react immediately, but in the past
New Delhi has said it is willing to discuss Kashmir only in the
context of broader talks between the two nations. It also has
rejected mediation by a third country, which Pakistan favors.
	   Kashmir, a Muslim-majority area, was ruled by a Hindu king who
opted to join with India when Britain carved out both nations from
its colony on the South Asian subcontinent. The region is now
divided between the two countries.
	   Pakistan wants Kashmiris of both sides of the border to be able
to decide which country they want to join. India opposes the
plebiscite, outlined in United Nations resolutions of the 1940s.

Japan's new prime minister concentrates on economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with comments from Obuchi comments; RAISES
new unemployment rate &QL; 
 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ With Japan's unemployment rate hitting a record
high, the country's new prime minister vowed Friday to move quickly
to revive the economy from its worst recession in decades and clean
up its debt-troubled financial system.
	   ``This Cabinet's biggest issue is how to overcome these severe
economic difficulties as soon as possible,'' said Keizo Obuchi,
elected premier by Parliament on Thursday, said in his first news
conference since taking office.
	   More signs Japan's recession is worsening hit the new
administration Friday: The government announced that Japan's
unemployment rate surged to 4.3 percent in June, up from two
consecutive months at 4.1 percent.
	   The June figure is the highest since the government began its
current system of compiling unemployment data in 1953.
	   Hours after his election, Obuchi named the members of what he
has dubbed his ``economic recovery Cabinet,'' including a widely
respected former premier to be finance minister, the Cabinet's most
prominent economic post.
	   Obuchi said Friday he would move promptly to implement economic
stimulus measures he had promised while campaigning last week to
win his party's nomination as premier.
	   These include 6 trillion yen (dlrs 42 billion) in tax cuts to
bring Japan's rates down to U.S. and British levels, 10 trillion
yen (dlrs 70 billion) in extra public works spending and up to a 20
percent cut in the bureaucracy over five years.
	   ``I will definitely carry out these promises,'' Obuchi said.
	   Despite the pledges, the 61-year-old former foreign affairs
minister is considered by critics to be too beholden to the special
interest politics that dominate the Liberal Democratic Party to
take the bold, innovative steps needed to solve the structural
flaws of the Japanese economy.
	   He tried to reverse that image this week by naming former Prime
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa to take the finance minister's job.
Miyazawa, 78, is respected by many as an economics expert and is an
architect of the government's plan to bail out its debt-laden
banking system.
	   Japan's banks are struggling to write off a growing burden of
loans that have defaulted or are at risk of default because of a
long slump in the nation's real estate market.
	   Because disclosure by Japanese banks remains so poor, the exact
size of the problem is still unclear. While the government
estimates that problem loans total 76 trillion yen (dlrs 535
billion), some estimates say the number may be twice that.
	   ``Without dealing with the financial bad loans, Japan's economy
cannot recover,'' Obuchi said. But he gave no details about what he
will do.
	   One of the first orders of business for Parliament, which began
an 70-day extraordinary session on Thursday, will be to pass
legislation put forth by outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
setting up a so-called ``bridge bank'' plan to liquidate failing
financial institutions.
	   The new government is under heavy international pressure to move
fast. In Washington, U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers said he hopes the new government will boost economic
growth, deal with the banking problems and accelerate deregulation.
	   ``These economic imperatives remain present with the political
changes,'' Summers said. ``We hope the new Japanese government will
move rapidly and effectively in each of these areas.''
	   In Thursday's vote, Obuchi won easily in the LDP-controlled
lower house. But the opposition-dominated upper house chose
Democratic Party leader Naoto Kan, considered Japan's most popular
politician.
	   Since the lower house has the power to overrule the upper house
in the vote for premier, Obuchi was declared the winner after a
conference between the two chambers failed to come up with a
compromise. It was the first time the chambers had split in a vote
for premier since 1989.
	   Obuchi's predecessor, Hashimoto, was forced to resign after his
party suffered a humiliating defeat at the polls earlier this month
in a vote widely seen as a referendum on the LDP's handling of the
economy.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An armed band loyal to the government of Georgia
ambushed a police patrol car in the breakaway Abkhazia province
Friday, badly wounding three policemen, news reports said.
	   The attackers opened fire with a grenade launcher and automatic
weapons on the Abkhazian police car as it patrolled the
violence-torn Ghali district, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The wounded men were taken to a hospital, where one remains in
critical condition, Interfax said.
	   Abkhazian Deputy Interior Minister Konstantin Adleiba said
pro-Georgian armed groups have stepped up attacks in the region to
drive out Russian peacekeepers who monitor the Ghali district,
according to Interfax.
	   The peacekeepers have tried to maintain calm in Abkhazia after
the province waged a 1992-93 independence war with Georgia that
left thousands dead.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Ministry of Defense has
asked the government of China to set up an arms repair and
maintenance facility in Thailand, a ministry official said Friday.
	   Thailand's military gets its weapons from a variety of countries
including both the United States and China.
	   The proposal was raised Wednesday during a meeting between
Deputy Defense Minister Gen. Wattanachai Wuthisiri and Gen. Zhang
Zhi-jian, a visiting high-ranking member of China's military.
	   Gen. Zhang said China would seriously consider the issue, said
Col. Phiraphong Thoboonme, a defense ministry spokesman.
	   Gen. Zhang also offered to sell weapons to the army at special
low prices to boost cooperation between the two countries, he said.

	   The 18-year-old from Most in northern Bohemia confessed to
having been the driver after police picked him up near the Czech
border Thursday night, hours after the accident.
	   German border guards say the man ran a roadblock early Thursday
then crashed into a stone wall while speeding around a curve. Seven
refugees in the truck were killed and 20 others injured, some
critically.
	   Another Czech man in the truck was also injured; he was arrested
at the scene.

German parties dismiss proposal to do away with life prison
</HEADLINE>
sentences &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ An election-year proposal by the liberal
Greens to do away with life-long prison sentences was quickly
dismissed Friday by mainstream parties.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Interior Minister, Manfred Kanther,
told the Bild Zeitung that the prospect of life in prison was vital
as a ``last internal check'' on those considering committing a
crime.
	   The general secretary of the arch-conservative Christian Social
Union, Bernd Protzner, called the idea ``especially perverse and
disgusting'' in light of recent rape-murder cases involving
children.
	   Even the opposition Social Democrats, whom the Greens hope to
join in a coalition government after Sept. 27 elections, said the
life-term must remain an option.
	   ``We don't see any need to change anything,'' said Herta
Daeubler-Gmelin, the opposition's shadow justice minister.
	   Green leader Juergen Trittin was undeterred, however, telling
the Tagesspiegel newspaper that even the Federal Constitutional
Court has questioned the constitutionality of sentencing someone to
life imprisonment because there is also a requirement that
prisoners be resocialized.

Communists rebels kill three government men, wound three others
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) - Communist rebels shot to death an
army officer and wounded another during an ambush then attacked a
nearby outpost and killed two more policemen and wounded two others
before fleeing, police said Friday.
	   About 100 Communist New People's Army guerrillas took part in
the Wednesday attack in Catarman town on Northern Samar island,
said acting provincial police chief Benito Lim.
	   Lim said the rebels had positioned themselves on a remote
highway in Catarman and opened fire on an army vehicle, killing 1st
Lt. Gabriel Rosales, an army company commander, and wounding
another soldier.
	   After the ambush, the rebels attacked a police outpost in nearby
Lavezares town and killed two officers and wounded two others, Lim
said.
	   Lim added the rebels fled after seizing a light machine gun,
five automatic rifles and two hand guns from the outpost.
	   Police said pursuing government men killed one guerrilla but the
rest escaped.
	   The provincial police chief Tua Uluma fired his intelligence
officer, Superintendent Edwin Balongay, for failing to detect the
rebel attack. However, national police chief Roberto Lastimoso
later relieved Ulama also for the attack.
	   Samar is among the few places in the Philippines where communist
rebels have a strong presence.
	   The rebels continue to engage in occasional hit-and-run attacks
against isolated military and police units despite ongoing peace
negotiations.
	   The talks to end three decades of insurgency have resulted in an
agreement on respect for human rights, which has not yet been
approved by Philippine President Joseph Estrada.
	   The human rights accord is the first of four agreements before a
political settlement is reached. The three others cover economic
reforms, political reforms and disposition of armed forces.

Basson says West swapped chemical secrets with apartheid state
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ The mastermind behind a secret
chemical and biological warfare program on Friday said Western
countries, including the United States, swapped sensitive military
information with apartheid South Africa.
	   Dr. Wouter Basson, whose scientists made poisons for government
assassins and researched a bacteria to only kill black people, told
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that Western governments
gave him helpful information as he sought to set up the program in
the early 1980s.
	   Basson gave no details of what secrets were passed, but he did
describe attending a 1981 conference in San Antonio, Texas, with
army officers from the United States, West Germany, Japan, Britain
and Canada.
	   Truth Commission lawyer Hanif Vally asked Basson if during the
conference U.S. officials had told him about their own chemical and
biological warfare programs in an ``incredible amount of detail.''
	   ``That is correct,'' replied Basson.
	   During the Cold War with the East Bloc, Western government
officials and army officers were so open because they wanted
details on the chemical warfare capability of Soviet-backed
countries neighboring South Africa, Basson said.
	   ``That was why I had good access to senior government officials
and people at that time,'' he said.
	   With its mandate running out at midnight on Friday, Basson's
testimony came at the last possible moment and follows two days of
legal argument as his laywers aimed to delay proceedings beyond the
deadline.
	   Earlier on Friday Basson's lawyer Jaap Cilliers applied for the
hearings to be held behind closed doors, citing fears Basson's
testimony could prejudice his upcoming trial on charges ranging
from drug possession to conspiracy to murder.
	   However, Dumisa Ntsebeza, head of the commission's investigative
unit, refused the request, saying questioning would continue in
public until specific incidents of prejudice arose.
	   At the original hearings in June, scientists working for Basson
described plotting to poison President Nelson Mandela, who spent 27
years as a prisoner of the white-run state, and hoarding enough
supplies of deadly anthrax and cholera to cause epidemics.
	   The news shocked a nation accustomed to gruesome Truth
Commission hearings and created headlines around the world.
However, until Friday Basson had avoided answering specific
questions about his role as head of the program
	   Set up a year after 1994 all-race elections ended apartheid, the
Truth Commission is charged with uncovering the facts about
atrocities committed by all sides in the fight against white rule.

Saturday deadline in Singapore-Malaysia train customs dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Train passengers traveling from Singapore to
Malaysia on Saturday were to be the guinea pigs in a standoff
between the two countries, bickering over where the Malaysian
customs and immigration post should be located on the railway line
that connects the perennially squabbling neighbors.
	   ``We don't know what will happen tomorrow,'' Singapore Foreign
Minister Shanmugam Jayakumar told Parliament late Friday in answer
to questions such as: Will the Malaysian border officials be
arrested if they try to clear passengers through customs at the
main railway station in downtown Singapore?
	   In Malaysia, Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik was equally
diffident. ``We have our contingency plans,'' he said. ``Tomorrow,
you will know.''
	   The first train was due to leave Singapore, heading for the
Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, at 8:15 a.m. (12:15 GMT)
Saturday.
	   For decades, customs and immigration for train passengers
between Singapore and Malaysia have been handled at platform booths
in the main railway station in the downtown Tanjong Pagar section
of Singapore. The causeway that separates the two countries is 18
kilometers (11 miles) to the north, and that is where buses, cars,
trucks and pedestrians pass through two separate immigration posts
on either side of the Strait of Johor.
	   The different arrangement for trains has a historic basis
because Malaysia still owns property along the railway line in
Singapore, dating from the years just after independence from
British rule. However, most of the daily passengers are Malaysians
workers who do not need to arrive in the central business district.
	   But in 1992, Singapore decided to move its railway customs post
to Woodlands, the checkpoint on the north tip of the island, just
across the water from Malaysia's Johor Bahru. Singapore said it
would be easier to interdict drug traffickers, smugglers and
illegal immigrants by stopping and checking trains at the actual
border.
	   Foreign Minister Jayakumar outlined to Parliament Friday a
history of the negotiations since then, saying that the Malaysians
first agreed, then disagreed with the change, first rejected
options, then accepted them after they had been withdrawn.
	   The news media in both countries have been used in a propaganda
war against the other in a replay of past disputes over water,
tourism, and other issues. Both nations were once joined in the
Malaysia Federation, but Singapore's authoritarian prime minister
pulled the city-state out after race riots and unsolvable political
differences. Affairs of the two countries are still tightly
intertwined, with Malaysia providing most of Singapore's water and
hundreds of thousands of its workers, while Singaporean businessmen
are principal investors in Malaysian business and industry.
	   Singapore went ahead building its new customs station to the
north, and said it would be operational as of Aug. 1, when the
Malaysian border checks in downtown Singapore would no longer be
legal. Singapore said it will make no sense to have Malaysian
customs officials checking train passengers into Malaysia before
the train gets to Woodlands where Singaporean officials are waiting
to check them out of Singapore.
	   ``Malaysian immigration officers performing immigration
functions at Tanjong Pagar will be acting without any legal
authority,'' said a travel advisory issued late Thursday by
Singapore. ``All endorsements made by them on Singapore passports
will be unauthorized and improper. And foreign national passengers
exiting from Singapore with such unauthorized and improper
endorsement on their passports may face difficulties at Singapore
immigration checkpoints.''
	   No further explanation was given.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's housing starts in June slumped 11.7 percent
from the same month last year _ the eighteenth straight month of
decline, the Construction Ministry said Friday.
	   Weak consumer confidence, hurt by rising unemployment and slack
demand for labor, was the main cause of the stubborn sluggishness
in housing starts, the ministry said.
	   The Economic Planning Agency announced Friday that unemployment
had soared to a record high 4.3 percent in June compared to 4.1
percent the previous month.
	   There were 106,715 housing starts in June. The figure fell 17.0
percent in May, 16.1 percent in April and 11.9 percent in March.
	   The ministry also said consumers are waiting to buy houses
because they expect the current super-low interest rates to be
maintained for now, and that rates are more likely to be cut
further than raised.
	   Japan's official discount rate has stood at the record-low 0.5
percent since September 1995.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese electronics giant NEC Corp. will invest
dlrs 225 million in Packard Bell NEC Inc. to take a controlling
52.81 percent stake in the U.S.-based computer company, NEC said
Friday.
	   NEC, which currently owns 49 percent of Packard Bell NEC, also
said that Groupe Bull of France will invest an additional dlrs 25
million in the company, bringing its total new investment to dlrs
250 million.
	   That will give Groupe Bull an 11.68 percent interest in the
company, while Packard Bell Electronics will have 35.51 percent.
	   NEC said that by making Packard Bell NEC a subsidiary, NEC's
consolidated sales in the current fiscal year through March will
increase by 300 billion yen (dlrs 2.09 billion).
	   The new investment from NEC and Groupe Bull will be used to
boost Packard Bell NEC's sales and promote its restructuring
efforts, said NEC Vice President Seijiro Yokoyama.
	   NEC aims to publicly offer Packard Bell NEC shares in about two
years, he said.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Hyundai Motor Co. fired 1,569 workers
Friday despite labor warnings that mass layoffs will lead to a
prolonged strike at the nation's leading automaker.
	   Some 3,000 unionized Hyundai workers, rallying in the company
grounds, vowed to continue their work stoppage that has crippled
company operations for 12 days.
	   Hyundai management says it has no alternative but to eliminate
redundant manpower to save the country's No. 1 automaker from its
deep financial problems, caused by sharp drops in domestic sales.
	   It has already shed 5,000 workers through early retirements this
year. Then this month, Hyundai told an additional 2,687 workers to
take early retirement with extra bonuses, or face outright
dismissal.
	   By the midnight Friday deadline, only 1,118 had taken early
retirement, Hyundai said.
	   Hyundai's 26,000 unionized workers went on strike July 20,
protesting the planned layoffs.
	   Hyundai plants have a combined capacity of 1.25 million cars a
year. But its plants are operating at 40 percent of that capacity
amid a severe economic slowdown.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Asian arm of U.S.-based global
investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. said Thursday it has
acquired Thailand's Peregrine Finance and Securities.
	   The Thai unit of Hong Kong's Peregrine Group was bought from the
group's liquidators, Lehman Brothers Asia said in a statement.
	   No purchase price was announced.
	   The former Peregrine subsidiary will operate independently from
Lehman Brothers Thailand Ltd., which has been principally engaged
in advisory services, the statement said.
	   Peregrine collapsed last year when Indonesia's currency, the
rupiah, plunged in value. The company had invested nearly one-third
of its capital in a taxi company associated with relatives of
former President Suharto.
	   When the rupiah weakened, the company could not repay its loans
and went into bankruptcy, dragging Peregrine with it.
	   Kittivalai Charoensombut-amorn of Lehman Brothers Thailand has
been appointed country manager of Peregrine, responsible for all of
Lehman Brothers' activities in Thailand, it said.
	   Peregrine's Thai finance and securities office has remained open
since the collapse of the group, but securities trading has ceased
for the past several months.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine Stock Exchange said
Thursday it has canceled the listing of Marcopper Mining Corp.,
which was forced to halt operations after a massive mine spill two
years ago.
	   Exchange president Jose Luis Yulo said Marcopper failed to pay
the fee required to maintain its listing.
	   A company official said the exchange refused Marcopper's request
to defer payment of the 110,000 peso (dlrs 2,700) fee because of
the company's financial problems.
	   Until recently, Canada's Placer Dome Inc. owned 39.9 percent of
Marcopper, once the Philippines' third-largest copper mining
company.
	   The government ordered the company to stop its operations after
millions of tons of mine waste spilled from one of its impounding
dams into a river on central Marinduque island in March 1996,
creating an environmental disaster.
	   Former company president John Loney, resident manager Steve Reid
and senior manager Pedro Hernandez face charges of criminal
negligence and violation of the Philippine Mining Act in connection
with the waste spill. Loney and Reid are Australians, while
Hernandez is a Filipino.

Myanmar democrats and US say Myanmar military refused Suu Kyi food
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Australia-US-Myanmar

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Leaders of Aung San Suu Kyi's political
party and U.S. diplomats have accused Myanmar's military government
of lying when it said it provided the Nobel laureate with water and
food during her six-day roadside standoff.
	   ``They willfully withheld food and water from her to endanger
her health,'' a U.S. embassy spokesman in Yangon said Friday. ``The
Burmese authorities lied to the international community, they lied
to the diplomatic community.''
	   Myanmar is also known as Burma.
	   On Wednesday evening, the military government ordered police to
restrain Suu Kyi, take the wheel of her car and drive her back to
Yangon against her will.
	   The 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner was stopped 32 kilometers (19
miles) outside the capital Friday morning by police as she
attempted to drive to the city of Bassein to meet members of her
political party.
	   Suu Kyi refused to return to Yangon and the military refused to
let her proceed, accusing her of trying to foment unrest. It was
the third time during July the military stopped her from traveling
outside the capital.
	   The military government spokesman issued several press releases
during the standoff accusing Western news agencies of fabricating
details about the impasse to exaggerate the danger to Suu Kyi.
	   He claimed the military was supplying Suu Kyi with water and had
food ready for her if she needed it, but her own supplies had not
run out.
	   Leaders of Suu Kyi's political party, the National League for
Democracy, and diplomats in Yangon, said the government lied.
	   They said the military refused to provide her with food or water
and prevented her from purchasing it from a nearby village.
	   Government spokesman, Col. Hla Min, said at a press conference
on Wednesday attended by diplomats that the military took the
initiative to force Suu Kyi home on the advice of her doctors.
	   ``We do not wish to see anyone's life wasted for no good
reason,'' Hla Min said.
	   ``If they really wanted to save her life, why didn't they let us
bring her food and vitamins?'' said NLD Chairman Aung Shwe who was
one of several party leaders who attempted to bring food to Suu Kyi
during the standoff and was stopped by the authorities.
	   Aung Shwe vehemently denied Suu Kyi's doctors had advised the
government to force her home.
	   Furthermore, one of Suu Kyi's two personal physicians was
prevented from examining the Nobel laureate after police found she
had hidden food in her clothing to give to Suu Kyi, an NLD official
said.
	   The U.S. embassy spokesman also said the authorities harassed
Suu Kyi in other ways.
	   ``She was further subjected to the indignity of authorities
videotaping her when she was bathing in the rain,'' he said,
speaking only on condition of anonymity.

Kuala Lumpur hotels stand half empty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian hotel rooms are standing
half empty due to the Asian economic crisis, the head of the hotel
association said.
	   Mohamed Khadar Merican of the Malaysian Association of Hotel
Owners told the Star daily newspaper for Friday editions that hotel
rooms were 75 percent filled last year, but that they would be
lucky to reach 50 percent in 1998.
	   He said the group might appeal to the government for help and
seek special rebates on assessments, sewerage and electricity
charges to see them through until the economic maelstrom has
subsided. He also suggested that the government might consider
price controls on room rates.
	   He said oversupply of rooms was now the main problem facing the
industry, and was prompting a competitive price war between hotels.
	   ``The price war has caused a negative chain reaction for rate
slashing, starting from five-star hotels down to the budget
hotels,'' Mohamed Khadar said.
	   ``The economic downturn does not augur well for us because the
hotel business is very dependent on a positive business climate in
the country,'' Mohamed Khadar said.

Bomb explosion kills police officer and injures a child
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A bomb explosion killed a
police officer and wounded a child in the central Bosnian town of
Travnik, local police said Friday.
	   Officers in the international police force said an unidentified
device exploded in a garbage container across from a joint
Muslim-Croat police station.
	   The blast killed officer Anto Valjan, who was returning from his
overnight shift as the device went off, and shattered windows on a
nearby building, wounding a child, said Franjo Grganovic local
chief of police.
	   Friday's is the fifth explosion in Bosnia this week.
	   Two bombs exploded the same day last week, one in Croat
controlled western Mostar in the south and the other in Muslim-held
Novi Travnik.
	   A few days later, an explosion damaged the Catholic church in
Kakanj, central Bosnia and the same day a hand grenade went off in
the center of Sarajevo.
	   The previous explosions caused no casualties and no immediate
evidence linking the explosions was immediately available.
	   In the run-up prior prior to elections last year, such
explosions were frequent. Bosnians go to the polls again in
September.

 &UR; Tour de France resumes, without Dutch team TVM
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more background on TVM, details of Friday's
stage, edits, trims.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LA CHAUX-DE-FONDS, Switerland (AP) _ The Tour de France got
underway Friday with its field yet further depleted after the
withdrawal of Dutch team TVM.
	   Plagued by an ongoing drugs scandal, just 96 cyclists from 14
teams started the race's 19th leg, which was heading to Autun,
France, a distance of 242 kilometers (151.3 miles.)
	   TVM pulled out of the race Friday morning, reducing the field to
just 14 teams compared to 21 at the start.
	   Jean-Francois Pescheux, the Tour's sporting director, said the
TVM team, which is at the center of the ongoing drug scandal, had
informed him of its withdrawal. Staff at the hotel where the team
had been staying said they left early Friday for the Netherlands.
	   The team cyclists are supposed to report for questioning in the
French city of Reims on Monday following the end of the Tour.
	   ``The cyclists say they are tired and don't want to continue,''
Pescheux said. ``They're within their rights. We're a little
disappointed.''
	   The treatment of the TVM team on Tuesday night was the focal
point of the Tour riders' protest the following day that led to the
annulment of the 17th stage.
	   The team's riders, suspected of drug abuse, were taken to
hospital by police and given lengthy medical examinations,
including blood, urine and hair tests.
	   After the pack stopped twice during the next stage, the rest of
the leg proceeded slowly allowing the TVM riders to cross the line
first, raising their arms in symbolic victory.
	   Meanwhile, police said TVM masseur Jann Moors, being held in
custody, would be questioned Friday by an investigating judge in
the city of Lille.
	   On Thursday, offering some welcome respite from the controversy,
Tom Steels won the 18th stage, beating Erik Zabel in a sprint
finish.
	   The result meant Marco Pantani stayed in the leader's yellow
jersey.
	   Two Spanish teams, Kelme and Vitalcio, on Thursday angrily quit
the field, joining two other Spanish teams and an Italian team, who
quit Wednesday. A sixth team, Festina, was thrown out on July 17
after police found dopants in a team masseur's car _ sparking the
current scandal.
	   Investigators also prevented a cyclist from competing after
finding drugs in his possession. Rodolfo Massi of Italy was still
in police custody Friday after drugs were found in his room during
a search.
	   The scandal was clearly weighing heavily on the competitors.
	   ``I'm just trying to get to Paris in one piece,'' said Frankie
Andreu of the U.S. Postal Service team. ``It's been kind of hard,
mentally.''
	   Pantani has a lead of 5 minutes 42 seconds over American Bobby
Julich, with defending champion Jan Ullrich another 14 seconds
back.
	   After Friday's stage, there is a final time trial on Saturday in
Le Creusot. In the last time trial of the Tour, Ullrich beat
Pantani by 4:21.

	   MIZUNAMI, Japan (AP) _ Yukio Ishiguro shot a 4-under-par 68
Friday for a one-stroke lead in the opening round of the 50 million
yen (dlrs 357,000) Golf 5 Ladies.
	   Ishiguro, who hasn't won a tournament in four years as a pro,

bogey-free round over the 6,449-yard (5,869-meter), par-72 Mizunami

Russian govt. pushes plan to ban Nazi materials
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Displaying a copy of Adolph Hitler's book ``Mein
Kampf,'' Russia's justice minister said Friday that the country was
determined to stamp out all Nazi materials with a new bill.
	   Russia has seen a recent rise in attacks blamed on neo-Nazis,
and the government wants parliament to quickly approve a measure
that would ban all Nazi symbols, literature and videos.
	   ``A rather strange situation has developed in our country
today,'' Justice Minister Pavel Krasheninnikov told a news
conference Friday. ``Our country defeated fascism, but some time
has passed and in the same country ... the works of Nazi and
fascist leaders are freely sold.''
	   ``Just the other day, without any trouble, I bought at a book
fair a copy of Hitler's book, `Mein Kampf,'' the minister said.
	   He held up his copy of the Russian-language edition of the book,
which outlined Hitler's political beliefs, including the notion of
German superiority.
	   The proposed bill was approved by President Boris Yeltsin's
Cabinet this week and will be submitted to parliament next month,
the minister said.
	   The measure would allow people to keep Nazi materials at home,
but giving them to others would be illegal.
	   The use of Nazi material would be available to the public only
if it denounced ``Nazism or related historic events ... (and) is
not aimed at promoting the ideas of fascism,'' the bill says.
	   Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union during World War II
caused tremendous suffering, and Nazi ideologues regarded Soviet
citizens as a pool of manual labor to serve the Third Reich.
	   Leaders of all parliamentary factions and of all major religions
in Russia have expressed support for the bill, the minister said.
	   ``It would be probably be strange if some parties or factions
spoke against this (bill), and one would probably be ashamed in
front of himself, his parents, and all of Russia, which has ...
suffered the most at the hands of the Nazis,'' Krasheninnikov told
reporters.
	   Still, Moscow has seen an increasing number of racist attacks by
members of neo-Nazi groups, drawing attention to the neo-fascist
movement.
	   Most members are young skinheads who are openly racist and call
for driving ethnic minorities out of Russia. Human rights groups
and neo-Nazi organizations estimate that there are about 4,000
neo-fascists in Moscow.
	   In highly publicized attacks earlier this year, a bomb exploded
at an Orthodox synagogue in Moscow, injuring two people and causing
extensive damage. Jewish leaders blamed fascist groups. Also, a
black American Marine was badly beaten at an outdoor market in an
attack blamed on neo-Nazis.
	   If the bill becomes law, violators would face a fine for a first
offense and a possible jail term for repeated offenses.

Hill returns to Belgrade

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- U.S. special envoy Christopher Hill
returned to Belgrade on Friday for talks with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic as diplomatic efforts intensify to arrange talks
on the future of rebellious Kosovo province.
	   Diplomatic sources said Hill was expected to discuss among other
things the humanitarin problem caused by a week-long Serb
offensive, which displaced tens of thousands of people.
	   Milosevic told a European Union delegation Thursday that he had
called off the offensive but made no mention of any troop pullout
from Kosovo.
	   Diplomats said Hill would urge Milosevic to live up to promises
to stop the offensive.

Minister arrested in Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congo's finance minister, Ferdinand
Tala-Ngai, has been arrested at his home in Kinshasa, his family
said Friday.
	   Tala-Ngai was implicated earlier this year in a newspaper report
accusing him of widespread embezzlement, but his family in a
written statement said he was arrested and charged with treason.
	   Police confirmed the arrest, but would not say what Tala-Ngai
had been charged with.
	   The finance minister had been visiting the eastern Congolese
towns of Kisangani, Goma and Bukavu earlier this month to promote
government aid programs and fiscal reform. Shortly after his return
to the capital of Kinshasa on Tuesday, Tala-Ngai was called to the
office of the president's Special Security Advisor.
	   The Kinshasa daily newspaper Vision in March reported that
Tala-Ngai was going to be arrested for allegedly stealing
government funds. The newspaper's publisher, however, spent a month
in prison for printing the controversial story.
	   This latest arrest comes about six weeks after President Laurent
Kabila launched a purge within his cabinet. Among his inner circle
of advisors, Kabila had at least five top ministers arrested in
June, including the director of Congo's state broadcasting
authority.
	   The broadcasting director was arrested for failing to televise a
ceremony to swear in new ministers who were brought in to replace
the arrested ones.

Leading gangland figure shot dead in Cyprus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMASSOL, Cyprus (AP) _ Andros Aeroporos, a leading member of a
gangland family, was shot to death early Friday as he was leaving a
nightclub with a Russian woman, police said.
	   The unidentified woman was seriously wounded, a police statement
said.
	   Two hooded people fired 25 bullets into Aeroporos' car as he was
about to drive away, the statement.
	   Aeroporos and his two brothers, Charalambos, 35, and Panicos,
25, were acquitted last month for the attempted murder of another
gang leader. The attorney-general has appealed the acquittal
verdict.
	   Charalambos was seriously wounded and an uncle of the brothers
was killed in gang warfare in Limassol two years ago.
	   National police chief Andreas Aides rushed to Limassol from the
capital, Nicosia, to undertake personal investigation into Friday's
killing amid fears that it would spark a fresh outbreak of
violence.
	   The Aeroporos brothers operate night clubs and are alleged to be
involved in prostitution, a business mainly dependent on Russian
and East European women. The Interior Minister told Parliament last
month that the illegal prostitution business in Cyprus is worth an
estimated 1 million Cyprus pounds (dlrs 2.2 million) a month.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ In a verdict that confirmed corruption at the
highest ranks of government, a former Communist Party leader caught
in China's biggest graft scandal was sentenced Friday to 16 years
imprisonment.
	   Chen Xitong, a former mayor and party boss of Beijing, is the
most senior leader to be prosecuted in a five-year-old
anti-corruption campaign that has seen hundreds of thousands of
officials disciplined and many, including Chen's son, jailed.
	   Before his disgrace, Chen rubbed shoulders with the likes of
Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin as a member of party's elite,
20-man Politburo, the apex of Chinese political power.
	   Many Chinese believed Chen was too powerful to prosecute. But in
deciding to punish him, his former colleagues apparently judged
that the need to make an example of him outweighed the risk that
exposing Chen might further blacken the party's corruption-tainted
image.
	   Abuses, ranging from doctors who take bribes for their services
to officials who steal from the public purse, have become so
widespread and so offensive to ordinary Chinese that communist
leaders admit that their monopoly on power may hinge on checking
corruption.
	   Since 1992, the Communist Party has expelled more than 121,500
officials and investigated hundreds of thousands of others for such
misdeeds as bribery, embezzlement and even feasting at public
expense.
	   As for Chen, Beijing's Municipal Higher People's Court sentenced
him Friday to 16 years in prison for corruption and dereliction of
duty, and ordered that bribes he accepted be handed over to the
state, the official Xinhua News Agency said. He has 10 days to
appeal.
	   The court ruled that Chen pursued a ``corrupt and decadent
life,'' including lavish partying at two villas that he and a
former Beijing vice mayor, Wang Baosen, built with public funds,
Xinhua said.
	   It was Wang's suicide in April 1995 as investigators were about
to arrest him for embezzlement that blew open the corruption
scandal that brought down Chen and cost Beijing as much as 18.3
billion yuan (more than dlrs 2 billion).
	   Together, Chen and Wang ``spent large amounts ... without
restraint on pleasure-seeking and wining and dining, causing
especially huge losses of public property and betraying the
interests of the state and the people,'' Xinhua said in its report
of the court ruling.
	   Chen also misappropriated official gifts, including eight gold
and silver items, six watches, four expensive pens, three cameras
and a video camera, Xinhua said.
	   Chen spoke at his trial, Xinhua reported, without saying what he
said. Chen had threatened to implicate other leaders if prosecuted,
according to Chinese sources with close ties to party leaders.
	   Photos of Chen in court released by Xinhua showed him flanked by
police officers, staring impassively ahead. It was the first time
Chen had been seen in public since the spring of 1995.
	   Chen's sentence was lighter than some of those handed down to
other, lower-ranked officials and it was unclear how far it would
go toward assuaging public anger over corruption. In a petition
last Sunday, four dissidents from northeast China had demanded the
death penalty for Chen.
	   Chen, 68, ran Beijing first as mayor and then as party secretary
from 1983 until he stepped down in 1995 ``to take responsibility''
for the scandal that erupted with Vice Mayor Wang's suicide.
	   Chen was stripped of his Politburo seat in September 1995,
expelled from the party last September, and handed over to
prosecutors.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A U.S. envoy urged Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic on Friday to allow aid workers to
deliver food, medicine and blankets to tens of thousands of ethnic
Albanians who fled into the hills to escape a major government
offensive.
	   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, also
said Hill would seek assurances that Milosevic has called off the
week-long offensive -- as he promised a European Union delegation
Thursday.
	   Unconfirmed reports indicated sporadic fighting was continuing
around the Kosovo Liberation Army stronghold of Junik, under
government siege for a fifth day.
	   Thousands of Albanian civilians are believed trapped in Junik,
but Milosevic promised the Europeans he would not shell the town.
	   Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, has been spearheading
international efforts to arrange peace talks between Milosevic and
leaders of the Albanian community -- 90 percent of Kosovo's 2
million people.
	   The KLA has been resisting international calls to unite behind
moderate Albanian politician Ibrahim Rugova, who opposes violence.
But diplomats hoped recent Serb gains during the offensive might
make the rebels more amenable to a negotiated settlement.
	   On Wednesday, Hill met with KLA representatives and said they
showed interest for the first time in endorsing the idea of a joint
Albanian delegation.
	   A reliable Albanian source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
told The Associated Press that the rebels asked Hill for a week to
decide whether to accept the negotiating team.
	   Meanwhile, aid workers Friday searched the rugged hills around
scenes of recent fighting in hopes of locating an estimated 20,000
people -- mostly Albanians -- displaced by the Serb offensive.
	   On Thursday, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees found about
500 terrified Albanians, including women and children, sheltering
in the hills near Malisevo. The ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation
Army abandoned the town on Tuesday.
	   UNHCR official Maki Shinohara said they had little food and no
water and were fearful they would be hunted down by Serb police.
She said U.N. refugee workers would try to send a convoy of food
and supplies to them Friday or Saturday.
	   In Geneva, UNHCR spokesman Kris Janowski said at least 100,000
people had been displaced since Milosevic launched a crackdown
against Albanian secessionists in February.
	   ``We're glad that the military operation is over,'' Janowski
said. ``But the problems aren't.''
	   Much of the funding for the armed struggle comes from Albanian
communities in Western Europe. Germany's foreign minister, Klaus
Kinkel, said he would meet KLA representatives in Bonn on Friday to
warn them that continued fighting in Kosovo would damage Albanian
relations with the West.

Australia says U.S. pledged to not undercut Indonesian wheat market

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The United States will consult further
with Australia before donating up to 1.5 million tons of wheat to
Indonesia, a move Australia fears will undercut its export market,
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Friday.
	   The U.S. wheat donation _ almost exactly the amount Australia
used to sell to its northern neighbor _ was the major irritant in
otherwise amicable talks between top U.S. and Australian political
and defense officials Friday.
	   In the talks, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer and
Trade Minister Tim Fischer sought guarantees from Albright that the
donation to Indonesia will not undermine Australia's commercial
interests.
	   ``We have got to make sure there isn't dumping (of wheat); that
this is entirely legitimate development assistance to help with
food shortages in Indonesia and that the commercial market isn't
disrupted,'' Downer told reporters during a break in talks.
	   Later, Albright said further talks would be held at senior
officer level to try and meet Australia's concerns.
	   But Australia should keep in mind the ``ultimate goal,'' which
was to feed hungry Indonesians and avoid social unrest caused by
spiraling poverty as a result of the Asian financial crisis.
	   ``Our programs are intended to feed hungry people,'' Albright
told a news conference after the talks.
	   ``The problem has now reached serious proportions and we believe
that if it is not addressed, millions of Indonesians will suffer,
and their country's reforms and commitment to democracy will be at
peril,'' she said.
	   ``That does begin to create potential problems of disruption in
the area with refugees and a whole host of issues in terms of
social disquiet.''
	   The United States and Australia estimate there are between 80
and 100 million Indonesians living in poverty, and that up to 20
million people do not have enough food because of the financial
crisis, Downer said.
	   Albright said the United States' promise of aid took into
account its obligations not to disrupt commercial markets.
	   ``We understand ... the level of angst about (the issues)
here,'' Albright said.
	   Downer said the details of the deal were still to be worked out,
and that if they were Australia would ``regard that as important
progress.''
	   ``The Americans have given us an undertaking that their
development assistance program for Indonesia wouldn't, in the area
of wheat, cut across our commercial wheat market,'' Downer said.
	   ``The fact that they have said that they would be prepared to
quarantine the commercial market from any development assistance is
heartening news.''
	   U.S. and Australian officials are to meet in Washington later to
work out details of honoring the pledge.
	   President Clinton said two weeks ago that the government was
buying 2.5 million tons of wheat to push up prices and help
American farmers. He said the wheat would be donated to countries
such as Indonesia, which has been hit by economic and civil
turmoil.
	   The United States has pledged to send 500,000 tons of wheat to
Indonesia, Albright said. Another million tons may be allocated
based on need, she said.
	   Australia exported about 2.5 million tons of wheat to Indonesia,
with a market value of about U.S. dlrs 310-370 million dollars
(500-600 million Australian dollars) a year, it said.
	   Trade and Deputy Foreign Minister Tim Fischer on Thursday said
the United States has a total of 2.5 million tons of wheat intended
for the dual purposes of humanitarian aid and ``export
penetration'' into Indonesia.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeline
Albright and her Australian counterpart on Friday asked U.N. chief
Kofi Annan to become involved in escalating tensions in Myanmar.
``He said he was going to take a very careful look,'' Albright
said.
	   Albright and Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer spoke
after meeting on a range of U.S.-Australian issues. Also
participating were U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen and
Australian Defense Minister Ian McLachlan.
	   ``Burma has moved further away from reconciliation and has
increased its isolation,'' Albright said, citing the standoff
between the military regime and opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
	   Albright and Downer both said conditions in Myanmar, also known
as Burma, are worsening and that the crisis extends beyond human
rights issues.
	   Downer raised the possibility that refugees from Myanmar soon
may flock to Thailand.
	   ``I know already that this is a concern of the Thai government.
And there is widespread concern in Asia. That was partly the
argument that we made to the secretary general,'' he said.
	   Albright has sought to rally world opinion against the military
regime and its treatment of Suu Kyi, an opposition party leader and
Nobel laureate.
	   Government police on Wednesday forcibly returned Suu Kyi to her
home in the capital of Yangon, ending a six-day highway standoff.
	   Albright on Thursday called the government's actions ``an
unacceptable violation of human rights.'' She upped the ante Friday
by trying to get the United Nations involved.
	   ``We had a discussion with the secretary general telling him
that we were very concerned about the fact that it is difficult for
diplomats on the ground to be involved in some of he negotiating
processes,'' Albright said at a news conference.
	   Annan was urged ``to become personally involved in it. And he
was very interested in what we were telling him,'' Albright said.
She said she and Annan would talk more about the situation over the
next few days, when they both are back in the United States.
	   ``I think he joined our concern about the fact that the handling
of her was so inappropriate in terms of the way that one handles
any citizen of a country, much less the leader of an opposition
(party). And he wanted to hear more from us about what we knew.''
	   Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party won parliamentary
elections in 1990 but never was allowed to take office because the
government annulled the vote.
	   Albright declined to criticize the tactics of Suu Kyi, who has
said she will try again to leave the capital. Albright called her
``one of the most hardworking and bravest people I have met in my
public life'' who has turned to such tactics because ``she has not
found any satisfaction.''
	   The government has blocked Suu Kyi three times this month from
leaving the capital, saying she was trying to foment unrest.
	   Meanwhile, Albright said that the United States was trying to
resolve a dispute with Australia over wheat exports to Indonesia.
U.S. President Bill Clinton's announcement that he would provide
free wheat to Indonesia as a humanitarian gesture has angered
Australian wheat farmers, who contend it will undercut their sales.
	   But Albright said, ``our programs are intended to feed hungry
people,'' noting that the Asian financial crisis and political
turmoil in Indonesia has made hunger there widespread.
	   Cohen told reporters the U.S.-Australian talks also dealt with
steps being taken to protect defense-related information against
computer theft and electronic espionage. He cited ``great
vulnerabilities ... We are spending a great deal of resources to
protect that information.''
	   Downer, meanwhile, took a gentle swipe at the United States for
not making some dlrs 10 billion in back payments owed to the United
Nations. ``It does make it more difficult for America's friends
that the United States does not pay its bills to the United
Nations,'' Downer said.
	   The payments are being held up by the Republican-led Congress.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The United States will consult further
with Australia before donating up to 1.5 million tons of wheat to
Indonesia, a move Australia fears will undercut its export market,
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Friday.
	   The U.S. wheat donation _ almost exactly the amount Australia
used to sell to its northern neighbor _ was the major irritant in
otherwise amicable talks between top U.S. and Australian political
and defense officials Friday.
	   In the talks, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer and
Trade Minister Tim Fischer sought guarantees from Albright that the
donation to Indonesia will not undermine Australia's commercial
interests.
	   ``We have got to make sure there isn't dumping (of wheat); that
this is entirely legitimate development assistance to help with
food shortages in Indonesia and that the commercial market isn't
disrupted,'' Downer told reporters during a break in talks.
	   Later, Albright said further talks would be held at senior
officer level to try and meet Australia's concerns.
	   But Australia should keep in mind the ``ultimate goal,'' which
was to feed hungry Indonesians and avoid social unrest caused by
spiraling poverty as a result of the Asian financial crisis.
	   ``Our programs are intended to feed hungry people,'' Albright
told a news conference after the talks.
	   ``The problem has now reached serious proportions and we believe
that if it is not addressed, millions of Indonesians will suffer,
and their country's reforms and commitment to democracy will be at
peril,'' she said.
	   ``That does begin to create potential problems of disruption in
the area with refugees and a whole host of issues in terms of
social disquiet.''
	   The United States and Australia estimate there are between 80
and 100 million Indonesians living in poverty, and that up to 20
million people do not have enough food because of the financial
crisis, Downer said.
	   Albright said the United States' promise of aid took into
account its obligations not to disrupt commercial markets.
	   ``We understand ... the level of angst about (the issues)
here,'' Albright said.
	   Downer said the details of the deal were still to be worked out,
and that if they were Australia would ``regard that as important
progress.''
	   ``The Americans have given us an undertaking that their
development assistance program for Indonesia wouldn't, in the area
of wheat, cut across our commercial wheat market,'' Downer said.
	   ``The fact that they have said that they would be prepared to
quarantine the commercial market from any development assistance is
heartening news.''
	   U.S. and Australian officials are to meet in Washington later to
work out details of honoring the pledge.
	   President Clinton said two weeks ago that the government was
buying 2.5 million tons of wheat to push up prices and help
American farmers. He said the wheat would be donated to countries
such as Indonesia, which has been hit by economic and civil
turmoil.
	   The United States has pledged to send 500,000 tons of wheat to
Indonesia, Albright said. Another million tons may be allocated
based on need, she said.
	   Australia exported about 2.5 million tons of wheat to Indonesia,
with a market value of about U.S. dlrs 310-370 million dollars
(500-600 million Australian dollars) a year, it said.
	   Trade and Deputy Foreign Minister Tim Fischer on Thursday said
the United States has a total of 2.5 million tons of wheat intended
for the dual purposes of humanitarian aid and ``export
penetration'' into Indonesia.

Outokumpu profit falls to dlrs 58 million in first half
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Citing sharp decreases in metal prices,
Outokumpu, Finland's leading mining and metals group, reported a
drop in its six-month pretax profit to 316 million markkaa (dlrs 58
million), down from 910 million markkaa a year earlier.
	   Net sales also fell, to 9.3 billion markkaa (dlrs 1.7 billion)
from 9.4 billion markkaa during the same period in 1997, the
company said Friday.
	   ``The prices of both base metals and stainless steel have
declined to very low levels, which has forced many producers to
reduce production,'' Outokumpu said.
	   ``The markets are regaining balance in the wake of the Asian
economic crisis, but no clear change for the better is expected in
the next few months,'' a company statement said.
	   Although Outokumpu had streamlined its operations to improve
cost-efficiency, ``difficult market conditions'' were expected to
push this year's result below that of 1997, the company said.
	   Outokumpu Group, which is also a leading engineering concern,
last year more than quadrupled its pretax profit to 975 million
markkaa (dlrs 180 million), mainly because of higher zinc prices
and a strong dollar.
	   Earlier this year, Outokumpu and the Russian metals giant,
Norilsk Nickel, said they were planning to jointly revamp and
expand Norilsk's aging operations on Russia's Kola Peninsula.
	   Outokumpu employs 14,300 people in 30 countries. The Finnish
government holds a 40-percent stake in the Espoo-based company.

Japan's new prime minister concentrates on economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to delete extraneous word from editor's line
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with comments from Obuchi; RAISES new
unemployment rate
 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ With Japan's unemployment rate hitting a record
high, the country's new prime minister vowed Friday to move quickly
to revive the economy from its worst recession in decades and clean
up its debt-troubled financial system.
	   ``This Cabinet's biggest issue is how to overcome these severe
economic difficulties as soon as possible,'' said Keizo Obuchi,
elected premier by Parliament on Thursday, said in his first news
conference since taking office.
	   More signs Japan's recession is worsening hit the new
administration Friday: The government announced that Japan's
unemployment rate surged to 4.3 percent in June, up from two
consecutive months at 4.1 percent.
	   The June figure is the highest since the government began its
current system of compiling unemployment data in 1953.
	   Hours after his election, Obuchi named the members of what he
has dubbed his ``economic recovery Cabinet,'' including a widely
respected former premier to be finance minister, the Cabinet's most
prominent economic post.
	   Obuchi said Friday he would move promptly to implement economic
stimulus measures he had promised while campaigning last week to
win his party's nomination as premier.
	   These include 6 trillion yen (dlrs 42 billion) in tax cuts to
bring Japan's rates down to U.S. and British levels, 10 trillion
yen (dlrs 70 billion) in extra public works spending and up to a 20
percent cut in the bureaucracy over five years.
	   ``I will definitely carry out these promises,'' Obuchi said.
	   Despite the pledges, the 61-year-old former foreign affairs
minister is considered by critics to be too beholden to the special
interest politics that dominate the Liberal Democratic Party to
take the bold, innovative steps needed to solve the structural
flaws of the Japanese economy.
	   He tried to reverse that image this week by naming former Prime
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa to take the finance minister's job.
Miyazawa, 78, is respected by many as an economics expert and is an
architect of the government's plan to bail out its debt-laden
banking system.
	   Japan's banks are struggling to write off a growing burden of
loans that have defaulted or are at risk of default because of a
long slump in the nation's real estate market.
	   Because disclosure by Japanese banks remains so poor, the exact
size of the problem is still unclear. While the government
estimates that problem loans total 76 trillion yen (dlrs 535
billion), some estimates say the number may be twice that.
	   ``Without dealing with the financial bad loans, Japan's economy
cannot recover,'' Obuchi said. But he gave no details about what he
will do.
	   One of the first orders of business for Parliament, which began
an 70-day extraordinary session on Thursday, will be to pass
legislation put forth by outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
setting up a so-called ``bridge bank'' plan to liquidate failing
financial institutions.
	   The new government is under heavy international pressure to move
fast. In Washington, U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers said he hopes the new government will boost economic
growth, deal with the banking problems and accelerate deregulation.
	   ``These economic imperatives remain present with the political
changes,'' Summers said. ``We hope the new Japanese government will
move rapidly and effectively in each of these areas.''
	   In Thursday's vote, Obuchi won easily in the LDP-controlled
lower house. But the opposition-dominated upper house chose
Democratic Party leader Naoto Kan, considered Japan's most popular
politician.
	   Since the lower house has the power to overrule the upper house
in the vote for premier, Obuchi was declared the winner after a
conference between the two chambers failed to come up with a
compromise. It was the first time the chambers had split in a vote
for premier since 1989.
	   Obuchi's predecessor, Hashimoto, was forced to resign after his
party suffered a humiliating defeat at the polls earlier this month
in a vote widely seen as a referendum on the LDP's handling of the
economy.

Basson says West swapped chemical secrets with apartheid state
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ The mastermind behind a secret
chemical and biological warfare program on Friday said Western
countries, including the United States, swapped sensitive military
information with apartheid South Africa.
	   Dr. Wouter Basson, whose scientists made poisons for government
assassins and researched a bacteria to only kill black people, told
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that Western governments
gave him helpful information as he sought to set up the program in
the early 1980s.
	   Basson gave no details of what secrets were passed, but he did
describe attending a 1981 conference in San Antonio, Texas, with
army officers from the United States, West Germany, Japan, Britain
and Canada.
	   Truth Commission lawyer Hanif Vally asked Basson if during the
conference U.S. officials had told him about their own chemical and
biological warfare programs in an ``incredible amount of detail.''
	   ``That is correct,'' replied Basson.
	   During the Cold War with the East Bloc, Western government
officials and army officers were so open because they wanted
details on the chemical warfare capability of Soviet-backed
countries neighboring South Africa, Basson said.
	   ``That was why I had good access to senior government officials
and people at that time,'' he said.
	   With its mandate running out at midnight on Friday, Basson's
testimony came at the last possible moment and follows two days of
legal argument as his laywers aimed to delay proceedings beyond the
deadline.
	   Earlier on Friday Basson's lawyer Jaap Cilliers applied for the
hearings to be held behind closed doors, citing fears Basson's
testimony could prejudice his upcoming trial on charges ranging
from drug possession to conspiracy to murder.
	   However, Dumisa Ntsebeza, head of the commission's investigative
unit, refused the request, saying questioning would continue in
public until specific incidents of prejudice arose.
	   At the original hearings in June, scientists working for Basson
described plotting to poison President Nelson Mandela, who spent 27
years as a prisoner of the white-run state, and hoarding enough
supplies of deadly anthrax and cholera to cause epidemics.
	   The news shocked a nation accustomed to gruesome Truth
Commission hearings and created headlines around the world.
However, until Friday Basson had avoided answering specific
questions about his role as head of the program
	   Set up a year after 1994 all-race elections ended apartheid, the
Truth Commission is charged with uncovering the facts about
atrocities committed by all sides in the fight against white rule.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The Kosovo Liberation Army has
asked for a week to decide whether to agree to a joint Albanian
team to negotiate the future of Kosovo with the Yugoslav
government, a reliable Albanian source said Friday.
	   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said KLA
representatives asked for a seven-day delay when they met Wednesday
with special U.S. envoy Chris Hill.
	   The Americans and Europeans want the rebels to unite behind
moderate, non-violent politician Ibrahim Rugova for the talks with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   On Friday, Rugova held a press conference in the Kosovo capital
Pristina and said ``some progress had been achieved'' in putting
together a shadow government and negotiating team.
	   But he did not announce formation, as some Albanians had
expected.
	   Rugova said that consultations are still under way regarding the
formation of the Kosovo Albanian government.
	   Asked whether the KLA will get any seats in the new cabinet,
Rugova replied the new government will ``have all the needed
ministry departments.''
	   There has been speculation the rebels would be offered the
defense and police portfolios in the new Cabinet.
	   Asked whether talks with the government could begin soon, Rugova
told reporters that ``it is very difficult to negotiate in these
circumstances.''
	   ``First, conditions must be created to enable successful
negotiations,'' he said. ``There is no purpose in just insisting on
a formal meeting by itself.''

U.N. provides Cambodia additional dlrs 1.68 million in election

aid &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The United Nations on Friday
provided the body which supervised Cambodia's parliamentary
election with an additional dlrs 1.68 million in aid to cover
allowances for some 65,000 polling station officers.
	   The money, which comes from a U.N. Development Program Trust
Fund set up earlier this year to coordinate an expected dlrs 10.65
million in contributions from 16 countries, is part of total dlrs
34 million in international assistance which went to Sunday's
election.
	   The Cambodian government contributed more than dlrs 6 million to
help conduct the polls.
	   The U.N. agency also loaned 21 pickup trucks and 40 motorcycles
to the National Election Committee, and will donate all the
computers and related equipment used for the polls to the body for
its future use.
	   Official results for Sunday's polls have not been released, but
projections show Cambodian leader Hun Sen's ruling political party
is likely to win, with Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party
and the Sam Rainsy Party taking second and third.
	   A year ago Hun Sen ordered tanks into Phnom Penh and deposed
Ranariddh in two days of fighting. He allowed Ranariddh to return
from nine months of exile to contest new elections in a bid to win
back international legitimacy and aid.
	   Hun Sen lost the last elections, organized by the U.N. in 1993
at a cost of more than dlrs 2 billion, but forced the winner,
Ranariddh, into a coalition with threats of renewed fighting.

German Social Democrats drop a point in poll to 41 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The Social Democrats have slipped slightly
in their bid to unseat Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government in
federal elections, but their potential coalition partners gained,
according to a poll released Friday.
	   The n-tv report on the poll by the respected Emnid Institute
found the Social Democrats dropped a percentage point from a week
ago to 41 percent.
	   Kohl's conservative Christian Democrats and the Bavarian
sister-party Christian Social Union had the combined support of 37
percent of those polled, unchanged from a week earlier.
	   The environmental Greens party _ potential partners for the
Social Democrats _ were also up a point in the latest survey to 7
percent. The centrist Free Democrats, the junior partner in Kohl's
coalition, remained unchanged at 5 percent, the bare minimum needed
to retain seats in parliament.
	   According to n-tv, more than two-thirds of those polled said
they were for a change in government after the Sept. 27 election,
with 37 percent saying they favored a coalition between the two
main parties.
	   Only 27 percent of those polled were for a coalition between the
Greens and the leftist Social Democrats, while 20 percent were in
favor of retaining the current center-right coalition government,
n-tv said.
	   An Emnid spokesman said the weekly poll of 1,000 voting age
Germans had a plus or minus 2.5 percent margin of error.

Thai mobile phone company allowed to delay debt repayment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Total Access Communication, a unit of
Thailand's second biggest mobile-phone operator, said Friday it has
signed an agreement with 50 creditors to allow it to delay
repayment of dlrs 537.7 million in foreign-currency debts.
	   Total Access is listed on the Stock Exchange of Singapore. Its
parent company United Communication Industry is listed on the Stock
Exchange of Thailand.
	   Easing debt repayment for Thai companies is a crucial factor in
whether and how soon the country will recover from its economic
crisis. Private sector debt in Thailand is estimated at about dlrs
62 billion.
	   The foreign currency debt of many companies ballooned after
Thailand floated its currency, the baht, in July 1997, touching off
the country's worst economic crisis in modern times and sparking
similar troubles in other Asian nations.
	   The government has implemented austerity measures in exchange
for a dlrs 17.2 billion bailout by the International Monetary Fund,
but government leaders have said that without debt rollover for the
private sector the economy won't turn around.
	   In the case of Total Access, in exchange for extending
maturities of its foreign loans for up to six years, the creditors
require the company to pay higher interest rates. Before the
agreement, Total Access paid an average interest rate of about 7
percent a year on dlrs 537.7 million loans, from now it has to pay
an average of 8.19 percent interest a year.
	   In addition, Total Access has to raise dlrs 150 million capital
within 36 months. Total Access now has 3.78 billion baht (dlrs 92
million) in paid-up capital.

Indonesia's president outlines governing style
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Indonesia's new president on Friday
offered a picture of how he wants to govern: in percentage points.
	   ``My style of government will concentrate on an 80 percent
prosperity and democracy approach, with a 20 percent security
approach,'' said President B.J. Habibie, who took office in May
when his authoritarian mentor, Suharto, quit after 32 years in
power.
	   Habibie is implementing democratic reforms and trying to haul
Indonesia out of its worst economic crisis in decades.
	   Fears linger, however, that the military may be faced with civil
unrest like the deadly riots over price increases that helped force
Suharto out of office.
	   ``My predecessor, President Suharto, had an 80 percent security
and democratic approach, and a 20 percent prosperity approach,''
Habibie told a visiting group of Malaysian business leaders.
	   A former army general, Suharto kept a tight rein on dissent and
made economic development a priority. Indonesia's economy grew
rapidly for years until folding last year amid Asia's currency
crisis, undoing much of the progress.
	   Habibie also said he was pleased that the International Monetary
Fund and other donors had resumed aid to Indonesia. On Thursday,
international donors in Paris pledged to Indonesia dlrs 7.9 billion
in new disbursements for the fiscal year ending March 31.
	   ``I am happy that the world is showing its confidence in
Indonesia,'' Habibie said.
	   Many investors, however, remain wary of Indonesia, where prices
and unemployment are rising fast.

	   Here is a summary of late news from The Associated Press.
Stories carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items
below have moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   TOKYO (AP) _ With Japan's unemployment rate hitting a record
high, the new prime minister vowed Friday to move quickly to revive
the economy from its worst recession in decades and clean up its
debt-troubled financial system. ``This Cabinet's biggest issue is
how to overcome these severe economic difficulties as soon as
possible,'' said Keizo Obuchi, elected premier by Parliament on
Thursday, said in his first news conference since taking office.
More signs Japan's recession is worsening hit the new
administration Friday: The government announced that Japan's
unemployment rate surged to 4.3 percent in June, up from two
consecutive months at 4.1 percent. The June figure is the highest
since the government began its current system of compiling
unemployment data in 1953. (JAPAN-POLITICS)
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Leaders of Aung San Suu Kyi's political
party and U.S. diplomats have accused Myanmar's military government
of lying when it said it provided the Nobel laureate with water and
food during her six-day roadside standoff. ``They willfully
withheld food and water from her to endanger her health,'' a U.S.
embassy spokesman in Yangon said Friday. ``The Burmese authorities
lied to the international community, they lied to the diplomatic
community.'' Myanmar is also known as Burma. On Wednesday evening,
the military government ordered police to restrain Suu Kyi, take
the wheel of her car and drive her back to Yangon against her will.
The 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner was stopped 32 kilometers (19
miles) outside the capital Friday morning by police as she
attempted to go meet members of her political party. In Sydney, the
U.S. secretary of state and her Australian counterpart asked U.N.
chief Kofi Annan to become involved in escalating tensions in
Myanmar. Madeleine Albright and Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer spoke after meeting on a range of U.S.-Australian
issues. (MYANMAR-SUU KYI, AUSTRALIA-US-MYANMAR)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ In a verdict that confirmed corruption at the
highest ranks of government, a former Communist Party leader caught
in China's biggest graft scandal was sentenced Friday to 16 years
imprisonment. Chen Xitong, a former mayor and party boss of
Beijing, is the most senior leader to be prosecuted in a five-year
anti-corruption campaign that has seen hundreds of thousands of
officials disciplined and many, including Chen's son, jailed.
Before his disgrace, Chen rubbed shoulders with the likes of
Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin as a member of party's elite,
20-man Politburo, the apex of Chinese political power. Many Chinese
believed Chen was too powerful to prosecute. But in deciding to
punish him, his former colleagues apparently judged that the need
to make an example of him outweighed the risk that exposing Chen
might further blacken the party's corruption-tainted image.

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Leaders of seven nations in South
Asia, the latest flashpoint of nuclear tensions, called Friday for
the elimination of all nuclear weapons, saying existing treaties
had not curbed the spread of the weapons. A declaration signed by
the seven _ including the two latest aspirants to the nuclear club,
India and Pakistan _ said the spread of weapons cannot be contained
unless everyone dismantles their arsenals. ``Global
nonproliferation goals cannot be achieved in the absence of
progress towards nuclear disarmament,'' said the document, also
endorsed by Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Maldives and Sri Lanka. At
the end of a three-day summit, the heads of government called
``upon all nuclear weapon states to engage in negotiations on
disarmament.'' They criticized the recognized nuclear states for
maintaining huge nuclear arsenals ``even though great power
rivalries have abated,'' the declaration said. (SOUTH ASIA-SUMMIT)
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ The mastermind behind a secret
chemical and biological warfare program on Friday said Western
countries, including the United States, swapped sensitive military
information with apartheid South Africa. Dr. Wouter Basson, whose
scientists made poisons for government assassins and researched a
bacteria to only kill black people, told the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission that Western governments gave him helpful
information as he sought to set up the program in the early 1980s.
Basson gave no details of what secrets were passed, but he did
describe attending a 1981 conference in Texas with army officers
from the United States, West Germany, Japan, Britain and Canada.
During the Cold War with the East Bloc, Western government
officials and army officers were so open because they wanted
details on the chemical warfare capability of Soviet-backed
countries neighboring South Africa, Basson said. (SOUTH

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Theodoros Pangalos is a diplomat _ a most
undiplomatic one. Since taking his post two years ago, his verbal
blasts have ruffled officials from Turkey to Washington.
	   But to many Greeks, who share the impression that their country
is unfairly kicked around by bigger nations, the foreign minister's
bare-knuckles style strikes just the right chord.
	   ``(Pangalos) many times cuts through what can easily be
described as the bull of diplomacy, hypocrisy and expedience,''
said Mario Evriviades, a political analyst with Athens' Institute
of International Relations. ``In this sense Pangalos does have an
appeal to the Greek public.''
	   His latest barrage was aimed at U.S. President Bill Clinton,
whom he called a ``liar'' for reneging on pre-election promises to
make the divided island of Cyprus an American foreign policy
priority.
	   The comments, which touched off a tit-for-tat exchange with
Washington, went straight to the heart of Greek perceptions that
the world's only remaining superpower has been siding with Turkey
in its disputes with Greece.
	   ``Your help, your friendship _ we have had enough of them. ...
Stop working for our good. We have seen this good. Thank you very
much, we have had enough,'' Pangalos said, referring to U.S.
initiatives in the region.
	   ``One thing is certain,'' the Athens daily Ta Nea wrote in an
editorial. ``That in this case, as in others, the Greek foreign
minister expressed exactly what the citizens of our country feel.''
	   In 1993, Pangalos, as European affairs minister, described
Germany a ``bestial force with a child's brain.'' Last year, he
used the words ``the bandit, the murderer and the rapist'' to
describe Turkish officials.
	   Turkey's foreign minister, Ismail Cem, returned the compliment,
calling Pangalos a ``psychopath.''
	   Greeks have for years suffered from an inferiority complex when
it comes to foreign policy. It stems from more than a century of
frustration with various foreign powers that have meddled in Greek
politics _ from the Balkan and Greek-Turkish wars earlier this
century, to the Greek civil war in the 1940s, to the Turkish
invasion of Cyprus in 1974 following an Athens-backed coup on the
island.
	   Cyprus has been divided into Greek- and Turkish-speaking sectors
since the Turkish occupation of its northern third. Turkey keeps
about 35,000 troops in the north, where a breakaway Turkish Cypriot
state is recognized only by Ankara.
	   A series of U.S.-led efforts to solve the 24-year division of
Cyprus have failed because of Turkish Cypriot refusals to negotiate
unless their breakaway state is recognized by the international
community.
	   Some political analysts believe Pangalos' remarks may be partly
linked to a growing fear that Washington could someday lean in
favor of recognizing northern Cyprus.
	   The 49-year-old Pangalos is well known for his dry wit and sheer
presence _ rivaling the size of another political ``heavyweight,''
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. A professor of economics, Pangalos
studied in Athens and Paris. He was elected to parliament when the
Socialists first came to power in 1981 and has held various cabinet
posts since then, but has specialized in foreign affairs.
	   He is the grandson of one of Greece's most quirky military
dictators _ a man said to have complained most about the short
length of women's skirts during the 1920s.
	   Various Greek leaders have over the years sought to take
advantage of the deep anti-American sentiments. The late socialist
Premier Andreas Papandreou, who lived for many years in the United
States, made a career out of America bashing and coined the slogan
``Greece for the Greeks.''
	   Pangalos, a politician who rose to prominence under Papandreou,
seems to have learned that lesson well.

Packers-Chiefs exhibition in Tokyo a big test for Pederson
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos TOK112-115,119-121 &QL; 
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The preseason clash between the Packers and Chiefs
in Tokyo on Sunday is shaping up to be a major test for Green Bay's
new No. 2 quarterback Doug Pederson.
	   While starting players will watch most of the exhibition game in
Japan from the safety of the sidelines, the American Bowl game will
give coaches a chance to size up their second-strings in action.
	   Pederson was the Packer's third string quarterback last season
and got the nod in April for his current spot _ a step away from
leading the two-time defending NFC champions. He had impressive
passer ratings of 83.2 and 94.4 in the last two exhibition seasons.
	   But he has struggled under his new title in training camp,
surprising both himself and the team.
	   ``It's an important game'' for Pederson, said Packers coach Mike
Holmgren. ``His role has changed so he has to get himself ready to
play. He has to have a good pre-season.''
	   For entrenched starters, the game will be a breeze. Packers'
star quarterback Brett Favre expects to play ``maybe about a
quarter.''
	   ``I'll try to do my best and give everyone a good show,'' a
relaxed-looking Favre said at a news conference in Tokyo on Friday.
	   The game will also put the Kansas City Chiefs' newly formatted
offensive strategy to the test. Offensive coordinator Paul Hackett
has been replaced this season by former running back coach Jimmy
Raye.
	   Kansas City coach Marty Schottenheimer said Raye will bring a
fresh perspective to the teams' play, especially in the passing
game where the Chiefs have relied on short, safe plays.
	   ``We will have some things that we do that are much different
than in the past,'' Schottenheimer told reporters after a morning
practice session Saturday, adding at a later news conference that
the Chiefs plan to be ``passing the ball up field in 1998.''
	   That means using starting quarterback Elvis Grbac more
aggressively _ something just fine by him.
	   ``I think it suits my abilities,'' Grbac said. ``Jimmy Raye has
given me the tools to go down field as much as possible.''
	   Sunday's game is a match between two teams that faced off in the
first Super Bowl back in 1966, and, as National Football League
President Neil Austrian noted, could be a preview of the next
league championship.
	   ``Green Bay is clearly one of the pre-season picks and so is
Kansas City,'' Austrian said.
	   Still, Schottenheimer was keen to play down any talk of a
unbeaten 16-0 sweep for his team, a prediction which apparently was
started by defensive end Derrick Thomas after the team signed two
key players, Chester McGlockton and Leslie O'Neal.
	   ``The likelihood of that is about the same as the odds of
winning the lottery,'' Schottenheimer said, mindful of the Chiefs'
respectable 13-3 season last year and playoff loss to the Denver
Broncos.
	   The Packers, hit hard by free agency departures, also expect to
remain contenders after their bitter loss to the Broncos in the
last Super Bowl.
	   Green Bay head coach Holmgren hopes for another chance this
year, saying a number of players, including Reggie White, had
performed well in training camp. A bad back had forced White's
brief retirement in the off season.
	   As for the controversy surrounding defensive end's appearance in
anti-gay newspaper advertisements, Holmgren said White's
off-the-field advocacy won't have an impact on the team.
	   White was featured in his Packers' uniform earlier this month in
ads against homosexuality. Following an outcry, White and 15
sponsoring Christian groups said he would appear only in regular
attire in the future.
	   ``It's not distracting,'' said Holmgren. ``They all know Reggie.
We also know that he's going to speak his mind about the things he
believes in.''

Yeltsin phones new Japanese prime minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin telephoned Japan's
new Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on Friday to congratulate him on
his election and call for continued cooperation between their two
countries.
	   Yeltsin expressed satisfaction with Russian-Japanese relations,
which he said were becoming increasingly neighborly.
	   The two countries have yet to sign a peace treaty formally
ending World War II, largely because of a territorial dispute over
the southern Kuril Islands, which Soviet troops seized at the end
of the war.
	   Yeltsin also invited Obuchi to visit Russia in November, the
presidential press service said.

Asian stocks close generally higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) - Asian stock markets ended the week generally
higher Friday, with the key index in Kuala Lumpur surging 3.4
percent on speculation that Malaysia's central bank would boost
liquidity in the banking system.
	   Dealers said there was talk that Malaysia's Bank Negara is going
to free up liquidity, a move they say would buoy the stock market.
	   Malaysia's corporate sector is burdened by growing debt, with
more than 20 companies having been granted court protection from
creditors.
	   Dealers say the market is optimistic that more liquidity in the
banking system will mean that fewer companies will join those in
trouble.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's benchmark Composite Index rose
13.12 points to 402.65.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices rose on expectations
new Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's administration will carry out
permanent tax cuts and implement measures to write off massive bad
debts held by Japan's banks.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average finished the day at
16,378.97, up 177.37 points, or 1.09 percent. On Thursday, the
average closed up 43.51 points, or 0.27 percent.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar rose sharply after Japan's new
finance minister Kiichi Miyazawa said that the yen and stock
markets should move ``on their own'' and intervention in foreign
exchange markets should occur only rarely.
	   The dollar was quoted at 143.78 yen in afternoon trading, up
1.48 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New
York rate of 143.66 yen overnight.
	   Hong Kong share prices closed higher for a second consecutive
session.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of
blue chips, rose 30.04 points, or 0.4 percent, closing at 7,936.20.
On Thursday, the index had gained 97.33 points.
	   Brokers said share prices rose on hopes that new Japanese Prime
Minister Obuchi will take steps to boost Japan's faltering economy.
	   They said the market was also boosted by an overnight rally on
Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 111.99
points to 9,026.95.
	   Elsewhere:
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower as investors remained
concerned about Taiwan's economic health. The market's Weighted
Stock Price Index fell 76.92 points, or 0.99 percent, to 7,653.51.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher, boosted by
rises in overseas markets. The NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 24.83
points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,122.31.
	   MANILA: Philippine share prices closed mixed. The Philippine
Stock Exchange index of 30 selected stocks fell 5.89 points, or 0.4
percent, to 1,607.61.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher. The All
Ordinaries Index rose 3.3 points, or 0.12 percent, to 2,704.6.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed mixed in relatively active trading.
The Korea Composite Stock Price Index slipped 1.58 points, or 0.4
percent, to 343.33.
	   SINGAPORE: Share prices closed slightly higher on
bargain-hunting. The Straits Times Industrials Index rose 4.67
points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,064.20.
	   JAKARTA: Indonesia share prices closed slightly lower on
profit-taking. The Composite Index slipped 0.971 point to 481.717.
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed slightly lower. The Stock
Exchange of Thailand (SET) index fell 0.02 points to 266.72.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Police on Friday confiscated more than two
kilograms (four pounds) of heroin, half-a-kilogram (one pound) of
cocaine and arrested two Albanians on suspicion of drug
trafficking, authorities said.
	   Dimitri Nasis, 24, and Petrit Faia, 34, both from Tirana,
Albania, were arrested while allegedly attempting to sell heroin on
a central Athens street corner, police said.
	   Authorities confiscated a total of 2,379 grams (5.2 pounds) of
heroin and 571 grams (1.2 pounds) of cocaine and a set of
electronic precision scales following a search of Faia's house.
	   The two were scheduled to appear before a prosecutor later

Philippine peso slips; shares end mixed on blue chips' retreat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine peso closed slightly
lower against the dollar Friday following the yen's overnight
losses.
	   Stocks, meanwhile, closed mixed, hurt by lingering concerns over
the poor prospects of both the domestic and regional economies,
traders said.
	   The dollar averaged 42.080 pesos for the day, up from Thursday's
42.016 pesos.
	   Some of the peso's losses were tempered in afternoon trading as
banks decided to relax their offer rates for the dollar because
demand wasn't strong. After opening at 42.15 pesos, the dollar was
last traded at 42.00 pesos.
	   Traders expect the peso to continue to take its cue from the
yen's movement.
	   In stock trading, the 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index
fell 5.89 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,607.61, a reversal from
Thursday's 8.23-point gain.
	   Gainers beat losers 46 to 38, with 47 issues unchanged, but the
weight of retreating blue chips still brought the main index lower.
	   ``The market is still in a process of discounting all the bad
news,'' said Lourdes Cinco, research director of Eastern Securities
Development Corp.
	   The broader All Shares Index slipped fractionally lower to
511.05 from Thursday's 511.1, when it gained 0.72 point.
	   The market opened on an upward note, but steadily lost steam as
trading progressed. The index slipped below 1,600 at one point.
	   ``Investor sentiment is being weighed down by the poor outlook
for the economy,'' Cinco said.
	   ``Investors are holding off their purchases, because in the back
of their minds, there is still that possibility that the market
might fall to 1,450,'' she added.
	   Andrew Co, analyst for Aurora Securities, said unless the
outlook improves, investors will likely continue avoiding the
market, especially next month.
	   ``August is considered as the ghost month among ethnic
Chinese,'' said Co, noting some investors will likely avoid
investing during this time. A large segment of local investors have
Chinese roots.

German language reform takes effect, but critics still fighting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The controversial German language reform
officially takes effect Saturday. But despite a green light from
Germany's highest court, not everyone is rushing to make the
switch.
	   Critics complain the new rules, intended to simplify the way
German is written, actually make things more complicated and were
still pushing Friday for at least a delay, if not complete
abandonment of the effort.
	   Opponents could still throw a wrench in the works if they win a
state referendum on the reform in Schleswig-Holstein on Sept. 27 _
the same day as federal parliamentary elections.
	   But it's unclear exactly what impact the referendum could have,
since Germany's highest court already upheld on July 14 the right
of the government to implement the changes.
	   Many schools in fact have already adopted the new rules, agreed
to in 1996 by officials of German-speaking countries.
	   They make writing snappier by eliminating many comma rules.
``The man who came to dinner'' will no longer require a comma
before the ``who,'' for example.
	   It also separates many strung-together compound words _
``remainsitting'' becomes ``remain sitting'' _ and introduces more
phonetically German spellings for foreign words, like ``Ketschup''
for ``Ketchup'' and ``Komminikee'' for ``Kommunique,'' or
communique.
	   While the Austrians and Swiss have generally accepted them, the
new rules met with hefty protest in Germany from leading authors
and many ordinary citizens who object to tampering with the
language of Goethe and Schiller.
	   Free Democrat chairman Wolfgang Gerhardt, whose party is part of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition government, said Friday that
linguists, writers and literary experts should be allowed to have a
say on the new rules.
	   ``Then they could take effect when they've been corrected enough
so that they are generally accepted as a real improvement,'' he
said.
	   Many newspapers and news agencies are waiting until after the
referendum to decide what they will do.
	   School textbooks have already been reprinted to adopt the new
way of writing, but many authors have demanded excerpts from their
works that appear in the books remain as originally written.
	   Many government bureaucrats, who are also supposed to start
writing the new way at work, are also balking. Official forms will
have to be revised and computer programs rewritten.
	   Half of the 16 states say they won't be ready by Saturday and
are putting off the switch.
	   ``How many work hours, how much energy will be put into this
chaos?'' Gerhardt asked.
	   In fact, the old way of writing will still be considered
acceptable until July 31, 2005. And adults who haven't learned the
new rules can keep writing their letters however they want.

Rolls-Royce chief quits after Germans agree to split carmaker
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The boss of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd. resigned
Friday, rather than go along with the plans of two German
automakers who agreed to move production of Rolls-Royces out of the
factory in Crewe, England.
	   Chief executive Graham Morris expressed ``deep personal regret''
at leaving Rolls-Royce, which has just been purchased by Volkswagen
AG for 479 million pounds (dlrs 790 million).
	   But Morris said he felt unable to stay amid plans by VW and its
rival BMW to carve up the company into two groups, one making
Rolls-Royces and the other making Bentleys.
	   When VW bought the Rolls-Royce factory, from the engineering
conglomerate Vickers PLC, it was not able to buy the rights to the
Rolls-Royce brand name. VW signed a deal Tuesday that eventually
will let BMW produce Rolls-Royce cars at a new factory that BMW
insists will be somewhere in England.
	   BMW bought the Rolls-Royce brand name and logo for 40 million
pounds (dlrs 66 million) from Rolls-Royce PLC, the jet engine maker
that controlled them for years. Rolls-Royce PLC wanted BMW, its
partner in an aerospace venture, to make Rolls-Royce cars beginning
Jan. 1, 2003.
	   VW will then rename its part of the company Bentley Motor Cars
as of Jan. 1, 2003. VW then will keep producing the luxury line of
Bentleys in Crewe.
	   This did not sit well with Morris, 48, who said earlier in the
week that uncertainties over the future of Rolls-Royce had pushed
new orders down by 30 percent since mid-June.
	   ``My decision is based upon the recent announcements that could
potentially see the Rolls-Royce business move away from Crewe,'' he
said in a statement. ``I now feel that it is in the best interests
of all concerned that VW appoint a successor for my role.''
	   The tabloid Daily Mail reported that Morris told colleagues
Thursday he would quit ``as a matter of honor,'' after assuring the
2,200 employees in Crewe for months that Rolls-Royce would stay
there after Vickers sold it.
	   Morris' statement said he maintained ``the greatest respect''
for VW and its chairman, Ferdinand Piech, who had stressed in a
news conference Tuesday that he wanted to keep Morris in charge of
Rolls-Royce.
	   Morris said he would stay in his job long enough to let VW find
a new chief executive for Rolls-Royce.
	   It was unclear who might get the job. VW spokesman Kurt Rippholz
did not immediately return phone calls placed to his office at the
carmaker's headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany.

Thai ministers get police motorcycles to beat traffic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai ministers will have police
motorcycles standing by to get them to parliament in a hurry so the
coalition government won't be caught short in a quorum call, the
government spokesman said Friday.
	   Bangkok is legendary for having some of the worst traffic jams
in the world. At times, the only way to cut through traffic is by
using a motorcycles which travel in between lanes of stalled cars.
	   Motorcycle taxis, where the passenger rides on the back, are
common.
	   Thai ministers were once notorious for making traffic jams worse
by traveling in police motorcades, forcing everyone else to pull
over and wait while they went by.
	   With the country in the midst of an economic crisis, however,
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai has sharply curtailed the use of
motorcades by officials.
	   The prime minister is also cracking down on lazy lawmakers who
fail to show up for parliament sessions.
	   Chuan has been personally calling members of his coalition
government who were absent without explanation and emphasizing that
he expects them to show up the next day, The Nation newspaper
reported Friday.
	   Earlier this month, his Democrat Party said it would limit
coalition lawmakers' bathroom breaks to five minutes each and make
them stagger their meal breaks to ensure they were present for a
quorum.
	   ``I'm sick and tired. They are all grown ups but they act like
children,'' deputy Democrat whip Charoen Khanthawong, was quoted as
saying in Friday's The Nation about his attempts to ensure his
party's absentee lawmakers show up.

Pakistan to exploit indigenous resources for power generation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AMIR ZIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Cash-strapped Pakistan plans to
switch from expensive, foreign fuels to its own hydroelectric and
coal resources to generate power, the power minister said Friday.
	   ``We are focusing on indigenous resources because they are
cheaper,'' the Federal Minister for Water and Power Raja Nadir
Pervaiz told reporters. For the time being, the government will
only consider new projects that involve hydroelectric or coal
power, he said.
	   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government is locked in a bitter
dispute with independent producers it says are overcharging for
power.
	   Most of the producers were awarded contracts by former Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto's government in the mid-1990s, and most of
them use imported oil for power generation.
	   The government accuses Ms. Bhutto of taking kickbacks in
exchange for awarding expensive power contracts and has threatened
not to honor deals it says are corrupt. Both Ms. Bhutto and the
producers deny the charge.
	   The government has already terminated the contract of one
private power company and issued notices it plans to do so to
several others, most of which are owned in part by foreigners.
	   Nonetheless, Pervaiz said Friday, the government has not
defaulted on payments already due to power producers. The
government paid dlrs 60 billion up to June, and owes another dlrs
93 billion by next June.
	   Pakistan has seen its foreign exchange reserves plummet since it
was hit with international economic sanctions following nuclear
tests in May. The sanctions have led to speculation the country
would soon default on its foreign debt of dlrs 30 billion.
Officials say they are husbanding their resources to avoid default
and that they expect a bailout soon from international lenders.
	   Pervaiz announced guidelines Friday under which he said the
government will guarantee new power contracts and ensure they will
not be affected by future changes in taxes and duties.
	   The government will also ensure convertibility of the rupees
into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates prevailing when contracts
were struck and allow remittances of foreign exchange to cover
payments related to debt servicing and dividends.
	   Pervaiz said the country was producing surplus electricity at
present and the existing public and private units could meet demand
at least until 2003. Additional power generation capacity would be
needed beyond these years, he said.

move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets ended the week generally
higher Friday, with the key index in Kuala Lumpur surging 3.4
percent on speculation that Malaysia's central bank would boost
liquidity in the banking system. Dealers said there was talk that
Malaysia's Bank Negara is going to free up liquidity. The Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange's benchmark Composite Index rose 13.12 points
to 402.65. On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices rose on
expectations new Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's administration will
carry out permanent tax cuts and implement measures to write off
massive bad debts held by Japan's banks. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock
Average finished the day at 16,378.97, up 177.37 points, or 1.09
percent. The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator
of blue chips, rose 30.04 points, or 0.4 percent, closing at
7,936.20. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko warned
striking miners across Russia Thursday that the government will not
tolerate continued blockades of the railways, a news report said.
Protesting for months of unpaid back wages, miners have blocked
rails across Russia in recent months, disrupting rail operations
and leaving many businesses short of supplies. ``The government
will instill order. The law will be enforced,'' Kiriyenko said,
according to the Interfax news agency. But miners on Sakhalin
Island ignored the threat and for a seventh day blocked the railway
that takes coal to the main power plant on the eastern island.
Their protest was expected to force plant officials to shut down
another power unit by Friday night because the station is running
out of coal reserves. As a result of the blockade, the island will
ration electricity, providing six hours of power each day to users,
including hospitals and schools, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported. (RUSSIA-MINERS)
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A visiting team from the International
Monetary Fund will recommend the disbursement of a badly needed
dlrs 2.2 billion loan for Ukraine, the mission's chief said Friday.
``We've reached a tentative agreement with Ukrainian authorities on
the program of stabilization and restructuring of the economy,''
said the official, Mohammed Shadman-Valavi. Shadman-Valavi
described the program as ``very ambitious.'' It aims to reform the
finance sector and reducing inflation, and end years of economic
decline. The mission's recommendation would be submitted to the
board for approval at a session expected to take place after Aug.
24, Shadman-Valavi said. The figure he gave for the loan, dlrs 2.2
billion, was slightly lower than the dlrs 2.5 billion Ukraine had
hoped for. (UKRAINE-IMF)
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Hyundai Motor Co. fired 1,569 workers
Friday despite labor warnings that mass layoffs will lead to a
prolonged strike at the nation's leading automaker. Some 3,000
unionized Hyundai workers, rallying in the company grounds, vowed
to continue their work stoppage that has crippled company
operations for 12 days. ``What management announced today means
nothing. We will continue to fight until the company retracts the
layoff decision,'' said a statement from the Hyundai Motor union,
one of the nation's most militant. Earlier Friday, Hyundai posted a
list of 1,569 workers being fired because of ``urgent management
reasons.'' Hyundai management says it has no alternative but to
eliminate redundant manpower because of deep financial problems
caused by sharp drops in domestic sales. (SKOREA-LABOR)
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The United States will consult further
with Australia before donating up to 1.5 million tons of wheat to
Indonesia, a move Australia fears will undercut its export market,
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Friday. The U.S.
wheat donation _ almost exactly the amount Australia used to sell
to its northern neighbor _ was the major irritant in otherwise
amicable talks between top U.S. and Australian political and
defense officials Friday. In the talks, Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer and Trade Minister Tim Fischer sought guarantees
from Albright that the donation to Indonesia will not undermine
Australia's commercial interests. Later, Albright said further
talks would be held at senior officer level to try and meet
Australia's concerns. (AUSTRALIA-US-WHEAT DISPUTE)

Prison escapees wage shootout with police in Russian Far East
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Ten convicts escaped from a remote prison in
Russia's Far East on Friday after killing a police officer and
stealing a large number of weapons, a news agency said.
	   Hours later at least some were surrounded by police and were
trading gunfire, Interfax said.
	   Police said they had the advantage in the stand-off on the
Chukotka Peninsula because it is so far north that the sun will not
go down far enough to provide adequate darkness for the prisoners
to escape.
	   Interfax said the prisoners killed a police officer and stole 23
assault rifles, 32 handguns, five shotguns, a machine gun, hand
grenades, ammunition and bullet-proof vests during their escape
from a prison on the peninsula near the Bering Sea.
	   They fled in two stolen trucks and an armored vehicle, and then
broke into a store and stole alcohol and food, it said.
	   With the help of armored vehicles and three helicopters, law
enforcement officials corralled the fugitives, six of whom are
soldiers suspected of murder, according to Interfax.

Human rights deteriorate in Cambodia after polls: Amnesty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details in grafs 6-7

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Amnesty International urged
strongman Hun Sen to call off his security forces Friday from
terrorizing members of the opposition following last Sunday's
parliamentary elections.
	   ``It is essential that (Hun Sen)-controlled security forces
cease their intimidating behavior immediately,'' said Demelza
Stubbings of the London-based human rights group following reports
of intimidation against opposition activists.
	   The human rights situation in Cambodia has deteriorated since
Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party apparently won the polls,
triggering retribution by his forces against those who had
challenged him.
	   Scores of supporters of Prince Norodom Ranariddh's Funcinpec
Party and the Sam Rainsy Party have fled Cambodia's rural areas to
Phnom Penh, seeking refuge at their parties' headquarters.
	   ``One after another, terrified people are fleeing their villages
in fear of their lives,'' Stubbings said. ``They have received
death threats and their houses have been surrounded and shot at by
security forces.''
	   Payback threats and efforts at intimidation include verbal
threats, shooting incidents and for those who have mobile phones,
threatening phone calls, the group said.
	   ``The problem for me is that no one will believe I have a
security problem until I turn up dead,'' one man told Amnesty
International who, fearing for his life, has been moving from house
to house.
	   Ranariddh won U.N.-organized elections in 1993. Hun Sen, who
headed a single-party communist state with Vietnamese backing in
the 1980s, refused to accept defeat and forced his way into a
co-premiership with threats of war.
	   He deposed Ranariddh last year in two days of fighting in the
capital. Official results of the election could be released
Saturday, but preliminary figures put the Cambodian People's Party
in the lead. Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy are disputing the results.

Thief steals marble dog's head from Uffizi Gallery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FLORENCE, Italy (AP) _ A thief mingling among tourists at the
Uffizi Gallery stole the marble head of a dog from an ancient
sarcophagus, museum officials said Friday.
	   The stolen piece, described as having little commercial value,
was pried off the coffin of a Roman general dating to the second
century.
	   A tourist saw the man take the piece two hours before closing
time Thursday evening and alerted security guards, but the thief
slipped away.
	   Italy's vast art treasures in museums and churches have been
plagued by thieves.
	   In one of the biggest thefts, thieves stole two van Goghs and a
Cezanne from the National Gallery of Modern Art in Rome in May. The
paintings, valued together at dlrs 30 million, were recovered this
month and eight people were arrested.

Taiwan's ruling party official to visit China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A senior official of Taiwan's ruling
Nationalist Party said Friday he will visit China next week to
attend an academic conference on cross strait relations.
	   Chang Jung-kung, head of the party's Mainland Affairs
Department, will be the most senior Nationalist official to visit
China since 1995 when Li Chung-kuei, a deputy secretary general,
attended an international women's conference there.
	   Chang will attend the Aug. 4-6 conference in Beijing together
with dozens of Taiwanese scholars and politicians.
	   He said the invitation from China was a sign of change that
could help promote understanding between the two sides.
	   ``They used to consider us as a spy agency, and now they regard
us as people whom they can promote exchanges with,'' Chang said.
``Progress has been made on both sides.''
	   Under the martial law era, Chang's department had been
responsible for spy activities in China. But since Taiwan began
democratic reforms a decade ago, it has shifted its focus to
studies of mainland affairs.
	   The Nationalists fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war
to the Chinese communists on the mainland. The two sides don't
recognize each other, and Taiwan bans official contacts with China.

UNHCR admits mismanagement but says chief seeking third term
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PHILIP WALLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ After reports the U.N. refugee agency was losing
millions of dollars because of bad management, senior officials
said Thursday its chief was considering seeking reappointment.
	   High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata is prepared to carry
on in the post for at least a shortened term when the post comes up
for re-election, UNHCR's Assistant High Commissioner Soren
Jessen-Petersen told reporters Friday. If Ogata, a former academic
from Japan, remains for another two years, she will have been head
of the agency for ten years.
	   ``That's what we all want, that's what governments want and that
is what she's prepared to consider,'' Jessen-Petersen said.
	   Governments had already approached Ogata to consider staying on
in the post, Jessen-Petersen said.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan expressed support Wednesday
for Ogata following a report in the London-based Financial Times
that its research and an independent auditors' report highlight
``serious failings'' in UNHCR's financial management. The report
alleged management incompetence, dubious accounting and possibly
fraud.
	   At a news conference, Jessen-Petersen conceded that the
organization suffered from institutional shortcomings ``and at
times mismanagement.''
	   ``This is an organization that in any event would be difficult
to manage without shortcomings and problems here and there,''
Jessen-Petersen said. ``Not all of us every day are Ogata's
angels.''
	   In particular, the agency had identified numerous shortcomings
in its management and operations in Guinea and other countries in
West Africa, he said. In Guinea, financial problems had been found
in the agency's dealings with its local partner organizations. But
those and other problems are being addressed, Jessen-Petersen said.
	   ``It has been a weak operation and yes, indeed, we are dealing
with it now,'' he said.
	   Donor countries have expressed concern about the newspaper
reports. The British government has said it feels there is scope
for improvement in some areas of UNHCR's operations.
	   UNHCR, at its own request, is meeting with governments today to
clarify UNHCR's position regarding the allegations, Jessen-Petersen
said. ``We don't think we are in a position where we have to defend
(ourselves),'' he said. ``But we have to explain so that donors can
maintain the trust and the confidence which ... many of them on the
phone have already told us they have.''

IMF mission to recommend dlrs 2.2 billion loan for Ukraine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details of the program, new quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A visiting team from the International
Monetary Fund will recommend the disbursement of a dlrs 2.2 billion
loan that Ukraine badly needs, the mission's chief said Friday.
	   ``We've reached a tentative agreement with Ukrainian authorities
on the program of stabilization and restructuring of the economy,''
said the official, Mohammed Shadman-Valavi.
	   Shadman-Valavi described the three-year program as ``very
ambitious.'' It aims to reform the finance sector and reduce the
budget deficit to 3.3 percent of gross domestic product in 1998,
and to about 2 percent of GDP in the following years.
	   The plan also envisages economic growth in coming years after a
decade of decline. In addition, the inflation rate is forecast at
10 percent in 1998 and 8 percent through 1999-2001. Last year's
inflation was 12 percent.
	   The IMF has set a number of requirements for the former Soviet
republic to qualify for the loan. Shadman-Valavi's team was meeting
with Ukrainian officials this week to assess Ukraine's compliance.
	   ``Members of the mission have positively assessed our work and
treated our problems with understanding. They also saw our
decisiveness in implementing economic reforms,'' Deputy Prime
Minister Serhiy Tyhypko told reporters.
	   ``This gives us grounds to hope that the IMF board of directors'
decision would be positive,'' Tyhypko added.
	   The mission's recommendation would be submitted to the IMF board
for approval at a session expected to take place after Aug. 24,
Shadman-Valavi said. The figure he gave for the loan, dlrs 2.2
billion, was less than the dlrs 2.5 billion Ukraine had hoped for.
	   If the IMF approves the EFF loan, Ukraine would receive a dlrs
850 million of it in the first year, Shadman-Valavi said. The first
tranche is expected to amount to more than dlrs 200 million, he
added.
	   Approval of the loan is crucial for Ukraine. Being chronically
short of cash, the country needs to repay more than dlrs 1 billion
to foreign lenders in August alone.
	   In addition, Ukraine's hryvna currency has been under pressure
in recent months because foreign investors have been withdrawing
from the country's financial market. The central bank has been
defending the country's currency, and reserves shrank by 15 percent
in recent months to dlrs 1.75 billion.
	   Ukrainian officials say the IMF loan, if released, would be used
primarily to replenish the National Bank's reserves.
	   The government has approved dozens of economic measures since
May, trying to meet requirements set by the IMF. Last year, the
fund refused to release a similar loan because of Ukraine's stalled
economic reforms, and it suspended aid for Kiev in the spring.

Official: Singapore will not set up unemployment benefits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore Minister of Manpower Lee Boon Yang
said Friday that the government will not introduce unemployment
benefits for Singaporeans who lose their jobs.
	   Speaking in Parliament, Lee said that funds for unemployed
generally do not deliver results and would not work in Singapore.
	   ``The real solution is to create jobs and help retrain the
retrenched workers,'' Lee said.
	   A Singapore union leader said earlier this month that tens of
thousands of Singaporeans may lose their jobs by next year as the
effects of the region's economic crisis make themselves felt on the
island nation's economy.
	   According to a Singapore law, retrenched workers with a minimum
of three years service are eligible for benefits, but payments vary
from company to company.
	   Lee urged companies to consider laying off as a last resort.

Packers-Chiefs exhibition in Tokyo a big test for Pederson
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS 10th graf reference to Friday, sted Saturday.
 &UR; AP Photos TOK112-115,119-121

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The preseason clash between the Packers and Chiefs
in Tokyo on Sunday is shaping up to be a major test for Green Bay's
new No. 2 quarterback Doug Pederson.
	   While starting players will watch most of the exhibition game in
Japan from the safety of the sidelines, the American Bowl game will
give coaches a chance to size up their second-stringers in action.
	   Pederson was the Packer's third string quarterback last season
and got the nod in April for his current spot _ a step away from
leading the two-time defending NFC champions. He had impressive
passer ratings of 83.2 and 94.4 in the last two exhibition seasons.
	   But he has struggled under his new title in training camp,
surprising both himself and the team.
	   ``It's an important game'' for Pederson, said Packers coach Mike
Holmgren. ``His role has changed so he has to get himself ready to
play. He has to have a good pre-season.''
	   For entrenched starters, the game will be a breeze. Packers'
star quarterback Brett Favre expects to play ``maybe about a
quarter.''
	   ``I'll try to do my best and give everyone a good show,'' a
relaxed-looking Favre said at a news conference in Tokyo on Friday.
	   The game will also put the Kansas City Chiefs' newly formatted
offensive strategy to the test. Offensive coordinator Paul Hackett
has been replaced this season by former running back coach Jimmy
Raye.
	   Kansas City coach Marty Schottenheimer said Raye will bring a
fresh perspective to the teams' play, especially in the passing
game where the Chiefs have relied on short, safe plays.
	   ``We will have some things that we do that are much different
than in the past,'' Schottenheimer told reporters after a morning
practice session Friday, adding at a later news conference that the
Chiefs plan to be ``passing the ball up field in 1998.''
	   That means using starting quarterback Elvis Grbac more
aggressively _ something just fine by him.
	   ``I think it suits my abilities,'' Grbac said. ``Jimmy Raye has
given me the tools to go down field as much as possible.''
	   Sunday's game is a match between two teams that faced off in the
first Super Bowl back in 1966, and, as National Football League
President Neil Austrian noted, could be a preview of the next
league championship.
	   ``Green Bay is clearly one of the pre-season picks and so is
Kansas City,'' Austrian said.
	   Still, Schottenheimer was keen to play down any talk of a
unbeaten 16-0 sweep for his team, a prediction which apparently was
started by defensive end Derrick Thomas after the team signed two
key players, Chester McGlockton and Leslie O'Neal.
	   ``The likelihood of that is about the same as the odds of
winning the lottery,'' Schottenheimer said, mindful of the Chiefs'
respectable 13-3 season last year and playoff loss to the Denver
Broncos.
	   The Packers, hit hard by free agency departures, also expect to
remain contenders after their bitter loss to the Broncos in the
last Super Bowl.
	   Green Bay head coach Holmgren hopes for another chance this
year, saying a number of players, including Reggie White, had
performed well in training camp. A bad back had forced White's
brief retirement in the off season.
	   As for the controversy surrounding the defensive end's
appearance in anti-gay newspaper advertisements, Holmgren said
White's off-the-field advocacy won't have an impact on the team.
	   White was featured in his Packers' uniform earlier this month in
ads against homosexuality. Following an outcry, White and 15
sponsoring Christian groups said he would appear only in regular
attire in the future.
	   ``It's not distracting,'' said Holmgren. ``They all know Reggie.
We also know that he's going to speak his mind about the things he
believes in.''

South Asian leaders urge total nuclear disarmament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-India-Pakistan-Nuclear &QL; 
 &UR; By NIRESH ELIATAMBY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Seven nations in South Asia, the
latest region to witness heightened nuclear tensions, called Friday
for the elimination of all nuclear weapons, saying current treaties
have not curbed their proliferation.
	   A declaration signed by representatives of the seven _ including
India and Pakistan, the two latest aspirants to the world's nuclear
weapons club _ said the spread of such arms can only be contained
if all nuclear powers dismantle their arsenals.
	   ``Global nonproliferation goals cannot be achieved in the
absence of progress towards nuclear disarmament,'' said the
document, which also was endorsed by Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal,
Maldives and Sri Lanka.
	   Ending a three-day summit, the region's heads of government
called ``upon all nuclear weapon states to engage in negotiations
on disarmament.'' They criticized the recognized nuclear states for
maintaining huge nuclear arsenals ``even though great power
rivalries have abated,'' the declaration said.
	   The acknowledged nuclear weapons states are Britain, France,
China, Russia and the United States.
	   The summit in the Sri Lankan capital saw the first meeting
between the prime ministers of India and Pakistan since the two
uneasy neighbors ordered nuclear tests in May, a move condemned as
undermining efforts to control the global nuclear threat.
	   In the economic arena, the leaders postponed a plan to turn
South Asia into a free trade area by 2001 but said they wanted to
finalize the framework for unrestricted trade by that year. No new
date was set for the South Asian Free Trade Agreement to take
effect.
	   The leaders also set an ambitious target of wiping out South
Asia's rampant poverty by the year 2002.

Rescuers search for bodies of victims of plane crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VANNES, France (AP) _ Rescuers searched Friday for the bodies of
eight people still missing after two planes collided over the ocean
in western France, killing all 15 people aboard both aircraft.
	   Rescuers had pulled out seven bodies from the sea by Thursday
night after the crash, but they had no hope that any of the eight
remaining victims were still alive.
	   The two small planes collided Thursday afternoon over the
Atlantic Ocean just off the Brittany coast. The larger plane had
deviated from its flight plan to give passengers a look at the
giant cruise ship Norway, formerly the France, which was in the
area.
	   An airplane and a helicopter scoured the area Friday in hopes of
discovering the remaining victims. Divers also hunted for bodies
and rescuer workers surveyed nearby beaches.
	   The Cessna and a Beechcraft 1900D twin-engine plane belonging to
the Proteus company collided in the bay off Quiberon, a port 505
kilometers (311 miles) southwest of Paris.
	   The Cessna belonged to a local flying club, while the Proteus
plane was on a regularly scheduled commercial flight from Lyon to
Lorient, a coastal city in Brittany.
	   Fourteen people were aboard the Proteus plane, including 12
passengers and two crew members. One person was flying in the
Cessna.
	   Created in 1986, Proteus provides service to 12 cities in
France. The company has about 20 planes and is partially owned by
the U.S. airliner Delta.
	   It was the worst air catastrophe in France since 1992 when an
Airbus 320 crashed near Strasbourg killing 87 people.

Newspaper report: new clues in SilkAir crash suicide theory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARRIFIES that pilot had previously turned off or erased
cockpit tape in lead, CORRECTS number of pilots killed in 1979 to 4
sted 3 in 9th graf.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A last-minute life insurance policy for a
debt-ridden captain, a prior incident of turning off or erasing a
cockpit tape, and an eerie coincidence were cited Friday in a
newspaper report suggesting a suicidal pilot caused the December
SilkAir crash.
	   The Asian Wall Street Journal reported that Capt. Tsu Way Ming,
the Singaporean pilot of the SilkAir jet that crashed Dec. 19 over
Sumatra, killing all 104 people aboard, had taken out an insurance
policy on his life just days before the crash.
	   It was worth several million dollars, the report said. The
captain, who left behind his widow and three children, is reported
to have been heavily in debt from speculating on securities, the
newspaper said, citing unidentified investigators and people close
to the crash probe for the details in its report.
	   One of the most puzzling aspects of the Boeing 737 crash is that
the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder stopped working
minutes before impact. Without those last moments of information,
there is no clue as to what the crew and the aircraft were doing in
the moments before it plunged at supersonic speed into a Sumatran
river.
	   Investigators have announced publicly that the engine was still
running as it hit the ground, a scenario that could be explained if
the nose had been aimed downward to deliberately crash the plane.
	   Suggestions that the troubled Tsu may have committed suicide,
and covered it up by turning off the cockpit's recorders, were
first raised by Aviation Week magazine early this year and have
been followed up by other newspapers. Indonesian, Singaporean and
American investigators have refused to publicly confirm most of the
details in the reports.
	   The Journal reported that Tsu had recently erased the cockpit
voice recorder in an aircraft to cover up a mistake. The action
caused the co-pilot in that previous incident to make a formal
complaint, leading to Tsu's demotion and ruining his chances to
move up to SilkAir's prestigious and better-paying parent company,
Singapore Airlines, the Journal reported.
	   The Journal reported that Tsu could have disabled the recorders
on the fatal SilkAir flight at a panel in the back of the cockpit,
unseen by co-pilot Duncan Ward of New Zealand, if he was flying at
the time.
	   Finally, the Journal reported, Dec. 19 _ the day of the SilkAir
crash _ was the same day that four of Tsu's flying buddies in the
Singapore Air Force had died smashing into a Philippine
mountainside during an acrobatic training mission 18 years before.
Because of a mechanical problem, Tsu had turned back, and thus
survived that mission.
	   While 80 percent of the SilkAir jet has been recovered,
investigators have reported no indication of a bomb, and no
apparent malfunction.

Italian ambassador: Border conflict ``strangely exaggerated''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ The border dispute between Ethiopia
and Eritrea, which claimed hundreds of lives during brief battles
and bombing raids last month, is strangely exaggerated, the Italian
ambassador to Ethiopia was quoted as saying Friday.
	   Marcello Ricoveri, interviewed in the private weekly Addis
Tribune, said the extent of the conflict was difficult to
understand in light of the once close relationship between the
neighboring countries.
	   ``How come suddenly, for a simple territorial dispute, they
(Ethiopia and Eritrea) become the worst of enemies, carrying
campaigns of animosity, hostility, sometimes hatred ... to such an
extent that it could seriously jeopardize future good
neighborliness?'' Ricoveri was quoted as saying.
	   ``There is a strange and peculiar aspect in this dispute.''
	   The border conflict, which erupted in clashes on May 6 and
escalated briefly into heavy fighting in early June, is stretching
into its third month despite attempts by regional and international
governments to broker peace.
	   The armies of both countries are massed along their common
border, with each side claiming territorial occupation by the
other.
	   The two governments were thought to enjoy close relations since
1993, when Eritrea's 30-year struggle for indpendence from Ethiopia
was rewarded with independence two years after Eritrean rebels
assisted Ethiopian rebels to overthrow a 17-year military regime in
1991.
	   In fact, the ``brotherly countries,'' were so close they did nad
not precisely delineated sections of their common border that had
not been reviewed since Italian colonists in Eritrea defined the
border between the Eritrea Italy then controlled and the rest of
Ethiopia in the first decade of the 20th century, Ricoveri noted.
	   He said his country has offered both Ethiopia and Eritrea _ as
well as any other party invovled in efforts to seek a resolution to
the conflict _ historical, cartographic, technical, economic and
financial assistance to help end the dispute, the Tribune said.
	   Salim A. Salim, secretary-general of the Organization of African
Unity, which has been attempting to broker talks between Addis
Ababa and Asmara, is scheduled to meet Saturday and Sunday with OAU
officials in Ouagadougou, in the West African nation of Burkina
Faso, to discuss the situation.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police released a dissident's lawyer Friday,
while another dissident appealed his conviction for aiding a
democracy activist escape China, a human rights group said.
	   While releasing Wang Peijian after holding him for 48 hours,
police in eastern Hangzhou city said he would remain under
surveillance and should report to them daily, the Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
	   Wang was detained Wednesday when he tried to photocopy documents
for the defense of a dissident in custody for organizing an illegal
opposition party, the Hong Kong-based Information Center said.
	   Meanwhile, a dissident in southern China, Fan Yiping, filed an
appeal Thursday against his three-year prison sentence handed down
earlier this month for helping a fellow activist escape China, the
Information Center said.
	   Fan filed his appeal with the Higher Level People's Court in
Guangdong province, bordering Hong Kong, it said.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Train passengers traveling from Singapore to
Malaysia on Saturday were to be the guinea pigs in a standoff
between the two countries, bickering over where the Malaysian
customs and immigration post should be located on the railway line
that connects the perennially squabbling neighbors.
	   ``We don't know what will happen tomorrow,'' Singapore Foreign
Minister Shanmugam Jayakumar told Parliament late Friday in answer
to questions such as: Will the Malaysian border officials be
arrested if they try to clear passengers through customs at the
main railway station in downtown Singapore?
	   In Malaysia, Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik was equally
diffident. ``We have our contingency plans,'' he said. ``Tomorrow,
you will know.''
	   The first train was due to leave Singapore, heading for the
Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, at 8:15 a.m. (12:15 GMT)
Saturday.
	   For decades, customs and immigration for train passengers
between Singapore and Malaysia have been handled at platform booths
in the main railway station in the downtown Tanjong Pagar section
of Singapore. The causeway that separates the two countries is 18
kilometers (11 miles) to the north, and that is where buses, cars,
trucks and pedestrians pass through two separate immigration posts
on either side of the Strait of Johor.
	   The different arrangement for trains has a historic basis
because Malaysia still owns property along the railway line in
Singapore, dating from the years just after independence from
British rule. However, most of the daily passengers are Malaysians
workers who do not need to arrive in the central business district.
	   But in 1989, Singapore decided to move its railway customs post
to Woodlands, the checkpoint on the north tip of the island, just
across the water from Malaysia's Johor Bahru. Singapore said it
would be easier to interdict drug traffickers, smugglers and
illegal immigrants by stopping and checking trains at the actual
border.
	   Foreign Minister Jayakumar outlined to Parliament Friday a
history of the negotiations since then, saying that the Malaysians
first agreed, then disagreed with the change, first rejected
options, then accepted them after they had been withdrawn.
	   Abdul Kadir Mohamad, the secretary-general of Malaysia's foreign
ministry, said Thursday the issue blew up after Singapore
instructed Malaysia in April to relocate its facilities outside
Singapore. He called the move ``unfriendly'' and said that
``Singapore refused to change any of its positions.''
	   The news media in both countries have been used in propaganda
wars in a replay of past disputes over water, tourism, and other
issues.
	   Britain allowed Singapore to govern itself in 1959, with Lee as
prime minister. In 1963, Singapore was incorporated into Malaysia,
an experiment which failed two years later after wrangling between
Lee and the late Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman.
	   Affairs of the two countries are still tightly intertwined, with
Malaysia providing most of Singapore's water and hundreds of
thousands of its workers, while Singaporean businessmen are
principal investors in Malaysian business and industry.
	   Singapore went ahead building its new customs station to the
north, and said it would be operational as of Aug. 1, when the
Malaysian border checks in downtown Singapore would no longer be
legal. Singapore said it will make no sense to have Malaysian
customs officials checking train passengers into Malaysia before
the train gets to Woodlands where Singaporean officials are waiting
to check them out of Singapore.
	   ``Malaysian immigration officers performing immigration
functions at Tanjong Pagar will be acting without any legal
authority,'' said a travel advisory issued late Thursday by
Singapore. ``All endorsements made by them on Singapore passports
will be unauthorized and improper. And foreign national passengers
exiting from Singapore with such unauthorized and improper
endorsement on their passports may face difficulties at Singapore
immigration checkpoints.''
	   No further explanation was given.

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Talks between India and Pakistan broke
down Friday, with Pakistan saying there was no basis for
negotiations to resume.
	   Pakistan accused India of taking a ``rigid and inflexible
position'' on Kashmir, the Himalayan territory that has been in
dispute for 50 years.
	   In Kashmir, Indian and Pakistani soldiers exchanged mortar fire
across the frontier Thursday, killing at least 52 and wounding more
than 100 on both sides, military officials of both countries said.
In one incident, India said Pakistani mortars fell on a military
hospital, killing 10 people.
	   While border clashes are common, the exchanges of the last four
days seemed heavier than usual. In Thursday's exchange, 22 soldiers
and civilians were killed in India-held Kashmir; 30 on the
Pakistani side, officials said.
	   ``It has not been possible to reach an agreement,'' Pakistan
spokesman Tariq Altaf said in Colombo, where the senior foreign
ministry officials of both nations met Friday.
	   ``No basis exists for resumption of dialogue,'' Altaf said.
	   However, Altaf said Pakistan will remain ready to hold an
``urgent, meaningful and result-oriented dialogue.''
	   Indian officials were not immediately available for comment.
	   The two countries have gone to war twice over Kashmir since they
gained independence from Britain in 1947.
	   The failure of the talks dampened hopes raised by the first
meeting between the Pakistani and Indian prime ministers since each
country detonated nuclear devices in May, a move which had raised
regional tensions to new heights.
	   After their meeting Wednesday, India's Atal Bihari Vajpayee and
Pakistan's Nawaz Sharif ordered their foreign ministries to find
ways to revived stalled discussions on disputes ranging from
Kashmir to demarcating the boundary of a lake.
	   The Vajpayee-Sharif encounter carried extra symbolism because it
was their first face-to-face discussions since Vajpayee's Hindu
nationalist government took office in March.
	   ``The outcome so far is zero,'' Sharif was quoted as saying
Friday after a Thursday meeting with Vajpayee.
	   In an interview published in The Island newspaper, Sharif
accused India of dragging its feet on Kashmir, which he said was
the core issue. ``Let us resolve the issues of Kashmir in a serious
and substantive manner so that we would be able to make progress,''
he was quoted as saying.
	   New Delhi has said it is willing to discuss Kashmir only in the
context of broader talks. It also rejected mediation by a third
country, which Pakistan favors.
	   Kashmir, a Muslim-majority area, was ruled by a Hindu king who
opted to join India when colonial Britain carved out both nations
in 1947. It is now divided between the two countries.
	   Pakistan wants Kashmiris of both sides of the border to be
allowed to vote on which country they want to join. India opposes
the plebiscite, outlined in U.N. resolutions of the 1940s.
	   Friday's talks stalled because India insisted it would not give
top priority to discussing Kashmir and the nuclearization of South
Asia, Altaf said. India has insisted it will discuss these issues
only in the overall context of bilateral relations.
	   New Delhi wants to link discussion on Kashmir to what it says is
continued Pakistani support to guerrillas fighting Indian soldiers.
	   During the talks, Altaf said, Pakistan proposed several measures
to build confidence between the two nations, including a greater
role for U.N. military observers in Kashmir, release of detainees
in Kashmir, and the removal of the Indian army from Srinagar and
other Kashmir towns. India was unlikely to favor any of those
proposals.

American converts to Judaism receive temporary residency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After more than two months of struggling for
Israeli citizenship, an American family of converts to Judaism has
has been granted temporary resident status, their lawyer said.
	   Sarah and Elazar Yaisrael, together with their four children and
two grandchildren, have been in bureaucratic limbo since their
arrival in June from the Chicago area.
	   Their plight has drawn some media attention and raised questions
about Israel's immigration policies. Israel automatically offers
citizenship to Jews, but fears have been growing here that large
numbers of non-Jews may try to obtain easy conversions abroad and
immigrate.
	   The couple were raised as Christians and converted to Judaism 10
years ago under the non-Orthodox Conservative movement. Elazar
Yaisrael was granted citizenship in 1996, but the rest of the
family was only given 30-day tourist visas upon arrival.
	   The family's temporary residency, which will expire after two
months, gives them identity cards, social security and health
benefits. But they are not entitled to other benefits given new
immigrants, including free Hebrew instruction and housing
subsidies.
	   The Ministry of Interior was to make a final decision before
their temporary residency expires, their lawyer Dan Evron said.
	   Evron said the Interior Ministry has not explained why it has
not granted the family citizenship, but said officials want to
review the files of Mrs. Elazar's two grandchildren, of whom she
has legal custody.
	   The Yaisraels say they cannot return to the United States
because their savings are exhausted. Sarah Yaisrael said she is
still hoping for citizenship for the family.
	   ``It isn't over till it's over,'' she said.

Tropical storm strengethens off Mexico's Pacific coast
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES Mexico-Storm for some points. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A tropical storm that formed off of Mexico's
Pacific coast is expected to become a hurricane but was heading
west and away from land, the U.S. National Hurricane Center
reported.
	   Tropical storm Estelle was over 300 miles (483 kilometers) south
of Manzanillo, Mexico at 11:00 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT), with sustained
winds of nearly 70 mph (113 kph). It was heading west at about 9
mph (14 kph).
	   Hurricanes have minimum sustained wind speeds of 74 mph (119
kph).
	   Forecasters said it Estelle would probably grow to hurricane
force by Friday, but early predictions of the track indicated it
was unlikely to hit land.
	   Meanwhile, U.S. forecasters predicted that another tropical
storm, Alex, would strengthen slowly over the weekend.
	   ``During the next two or three days, we expect gradual
strengthening and probably not a direct hit to any land area during
that period,'' Ed Rappaport, a specialist with the National
Hurricane Center in Florida, said late Thursday.
	   At 5 a.m. EDT (0900 GMT) Friday, Alex was located near 16.2
north latitude, 48.9 west longitude. It was about 800 miles (1,287
kilometers) east of the Leeward Islands in the eastern Caribbean.
	   The storm was moving west-northwest near 13 mph (20 kph) with
top sustained winds of 50 mph (80 kph). Those figures were the same
late Thursday and weren't expected to change much Friday _ though
forecasters said Alex might reach hurricane strength within a
couple of days.

Philippine official says government bankruptcy won't deter
</HEADLINE>
investors

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine President Joseph Estrada's
pronouncement that the government is bankrupt should not adversely
affect its plan to attract international investors, an official
said Friday.
	   ``International investors know that the president is talking
about bankruptcy to mobilize more support from the people,''
presidential Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora told a
businessmen's group.
	   In his state-of-the-nation address on Monday, Estrada painted a
bleak picture of the economy's 1998 prospects, saying a gross
national product growth of only 2 percent to 3 percent is
achievable. In 1997, GNP grew 5.8 percent.
	   Estrada also warned the government's budget deficit could
balloon to 70 billion pesos (dlrs 1.7 billion) by the end of the
year unless public expenditures are cut.
	   Zamora said that while the government is bankrupt, the business
community isn't.
	   He stressed that while prospects for the country's economic
growth are weak, the government is determined to improve the
country's chances of a recovery from the region's financial crisis.
	   Zamora was speaking to members of the Makati Business Club,
which groups some 600 businessmen including chief executive
officers of the country's top corporations.
	   The club shares the government's pessimism over the country's
growth prospects for the year. In a survey conducted in July, a
majority of respondents from the club said they expect the economy
to expand by a maximum of only 2.5 percent, lower than the upper
end of the government's target.
	   ``Pessimism remains because the crisis remains,'' said Guillermo
Luz, the club's executive director.
	   Luz believes, however, that the economy could pick up in the
next 12 months as long as the government fulfills its promise of
spending cuts and increased revenue collection, improving
investors' confidence in the country and preventing crimes.
	   ``The economy can turn around in six to 12 months if the
government does all the right moves,'' Luz said.
	   The government has announced plans to issue an international
bond offering worth at least dlrs 500 million in the last quarter
of the year.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congo's finance minister, Ferdinand
Tala-Ngai, along with a leading opposition politician have been
arrested in Kinshasa over the past two days, relatives and
authorities said Friday.
	   Eugene Diomi Ndongala, a cabinet minister in the government of
former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, was arrested Friday morning by
Intelligence Service agents, his wife said.
	   No reason for his arrest was given, she said, asking that her
name not be used. This is the second time since the fall of the
Mobutu regime last year that Ndongala has been arrested.
	   Now a leading opposition politician and the founder of the
Christian Democratic Party, Ndongala was also detained last year.
	   On Thursday, Tala-Ngai, the finance minister in Laurent Kabila's
government, was arrested at his home after being implicated earlier
this year in a newspaper article accusing him of widespread
embezzlement.
	   His family in a written statement said, however, he had been
charged with treason.
	   Police confirmed the arrest, but would not say what Tala-Ngai
had been charged with.
	   The finance minister had been visiting the eastern Congolese
towns of Kisangani, Goma and Bukavu earlier this month to promote
government aid programs and fiscal reform. Shortly after his return
to the capital of Kinshasa on Tuesday, Tala-Ngai was called to the
office of the president's Special Security Advisor.
	   The Kinshasa daily newspaper Vision in March reported that
Tala-Ngai was going to be arrested for allegedly stealing
government funds. The newspaper's publisher, however, spent a month
in prison for printing the controversial story.
	   This latest arrests come about six weeks after President Laurent
Kabila launched a purge within his cabinet. Among his inner circle
of advisors, Kabila had at least five top ministers arrested in
June, including the director of Congo's state broadcasting
authority.
	   The broadcasting director was arrested for failing to televise a
ceremony to swear in new ministers who were brought in to replace
the arrested ones.

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Talks between India and Pakistan to
revive negotiations on long-standing disputes broke down Friday,
with Pakistan saying it found no basis for resuming the dialogue
and India accusing its neighbor of interfering in its domestic
affairs.
	   In Kashmir, the main dispute India and Pakistan were trying to
solve, soldiers exchanged mortar and artillery fire across the
frontier, killing 52 people and injuring more than 100 others,
mostly civilians. While border clashes are common, the exchanges of
the last four days were heavier than usual.
	   Pakistani spokesman Tariq Altaf accused India of taking a
``rigid and inflexible position'' on Kashmir, over which two wars
have been fought since India and Pakistan became independent 50
years ago.
	   Altaf said ``it has not been possible to reach an agreement,''
after officials met briefly, for the second time this week, in
Colombo. ``No basis exists for resumption of dialogue,'' Altaf
said.
	   Altaf said Pakistan will remain ready to hold a ``urgent,
meaningful and result-oriented dialogue'' to resolve the disputes.
	   India's senior diplomat, Foreign Secretary K. Raghunath, said
Pakistan's ``obsessive'' focus on Kashmir while ignoring other
disputes ``is as neurotic for individuals as for nations.''
	   Pakistan suggested a list of measures India should take to build
confidence, such as releasing prisoners and giving U.N. monitors a
greater role. But Raghunath dismissed the proposals as meddling in
India's business. ``They don't constitute a realistic basis for
conducting negotiations,'' he said.
	   The failure of the talks dampened hopes raised by the first
meeting between the Pakistani and Indian prime ministers since each
country detonated nuclear devices in May, a move that raised
regional tensions to new heights.

accused India of dragging its feet on Kashmir, which he said was
the core issue between the neighboring nations. ``Let us resolve

Rolls-Royce chief quits after Germans agree to split carmaker
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS in new grafs 11-12 with VW chairman's comments from
Tuesday about wanting to keep Morris; minor editing below; no
pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The boss of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd. resigned
Friday, rather than go along with the plans of two German
automakers who agreed to move production of Rolls-Royces out of the
factory in Crewe, England.
	   Chief executive Graham Morris expressed ``deep personal regret''
at leaving Rolls-Royce, which has just been purchased by Volkswagen
AG for 479 million pounds (dlrs 790 million).
	   But Morris said he felt unable to stay amid plans by VW and its
rival BMW to carve up the company into two groups, one making
Rolls-Royces and the other making Bentleys.
	   When VW bought the Rolls-Royce factory, from the engineering
conglomerate Vickers PLC, it was not able to buy the rights to the
Rolls-Royce brand name. VW signed a deal Tuesday that eventually
will let BMW produce Rolls-Royce cars at a new factory that BMW
insists will be somewhere in England.
	   BMW bought the Rolls-Royce brand name and logo for 40 million
pounds (dlrs 66 million) from Rolls-Royce PLC, the jet engine maker
that controlled them for years. Rolls-Royce PLC wanted BMW, its
partner in an aerospace venture, to make Rolls-Royce cars beginning
Jan. 1, 2003.
	   VW will then rename its part of the company Bentley Motor Cars
as of Jan. 1, 2003. VW then will keep producing the luxury line of
Bentleys in Crewe.
	   This did not sit well with Morris, 48, who said earlier in the
week that uncertainties over the future of Rolls-Royce had pushed
new orders down by 30 percent since mid-June.
	   ``My decision is based upon the recent announcements that could
potentially see the Rolls-Royce business move away from Crewe,'' he
said in a statement. ``I now feel that it is in the best interests
of all concerned that VW appoint a successor for my role.''
	   The tabloid Daily Mail reported that Morris told colleagues
Thursday he would quit ``as a matter of honor,'' after assuring the
2,200 employees in Crewe for months that Rolls-Royce would stay
there after Vickers sold it.
	   Morris' statement said he maintained ``the greatest respect''
for VW and its chairman, Ferdinand Piech, who had stressed in a
news conference Tuesday that he wanted to keep Morris in charge of
Rolls-Royce.
	   Asked about management plans for Rolls-Royce, Piech pointed out
he had lost Morris as an employee once, when Morris left an
executive sales job at VW's subsidiary Audi to join Rolls-Royce in
April 1995. The VW boss said he had no intention of letting Morris
get away a second time.
	   ``No. He's mine,'' the German executive joked.
	   Not for long. Morris said Friday he would stay in his job long
enough to let VW find a replacement.
	   It was unclear who might get the job or when the successor would
be chosen. VW spokesman Kurt Rippholz did not immediately return
phone calls placed to his office at VW headquarters in Wolfsburg,
Germany.

<TEXT>
	   ORANIENBURG, Germany (AP) _ Police were looking Friday for a
plaster eagle that flew the coop in eastern Germany.
	   The 40 centimeters (16 inches) tall eagle with an equally wide
wingspan disappeared from the top of a memorial for victims of
World War I sometime early Tuesday, according to police in
Oranienburg, just north of Berlin.
	   Police spokesman Uwe Konzack said there were no suspects in the
case and investigators are still puzzling over the possible motive.

Court rejects compensation demand by South Korean war veteran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A court dismissed on Friday a demand for veterans
benefits from a South Korean man wounded while fighting for Japan
in World War II, court officials said.
	   Kim Sung-soo, 73, of Pusan, South Korea, filed the lawsuit in
January 1995 after the Japanese government turned down his request
for a veteran's pension a year earlier on grounds that he is not a
Japanese citizen.
	   During the war, the imperial Japanese military conscripted
millions of people from Japanese-held Asian countries for forced
labor and military service, and for sexual slavery for Japanese
troops.
	   The Japanese government pays its own war veterans and their
families, including those of war criminals, pensions and other
compensation.
	   But citing postwar treaties that settled war reparations, it has
refused to pay compensation to non-Japanese.
	   Kim and his supporters have claimed that such restriction
unfairly discriminate against Koreans and other non-Japanese in
violation of Constitutional guarantees of equality.
	   In dismissing Kim's claim, presiding judge Kazuhiro Tomikoshi
defended Japan's current policy, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   ``The Pension Law, which limits recipients to Japanese citizens,
is reasonable and cannot be said unconstitutional,'' Tomikoshi was
quoted as saying by Kyodo.
	   Kim, who joined the Imperial Japanese Army as a volunteer in
1942, lost his right arm in the battlefield in then-Burma, Kyodo
said. He returned to his home country after the war. Since the late
1970s, he has led a campaign questioning Japan's wartime
responsibility, it said.
	   The Management and Coordination Agency, in charge of veteran
pension payments, said in 1994 that claims by South Korean
nationals were waived in the 1952 San Francisco peace treaty.
	   Japan colonized the Korean peninsula from 1910 until 1945.

Benazir Bhutto files defamation suit against corruption
</HEADLINE>
investigator &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
filed a million-rupee (million-dollar) defamation suit against
Pakistan's top corruption investigator, saying he was making it
impossible for her to get a fair trial.
	   In her court papers, Ms. Bhutto accused Saifur Rehman, head of
the Accountability Commission, of defaming her in comments to
journalists. She sought 20 million rupees (about dlrs 350,000) for
mental anguish and another 70 million rupees (about dlrs 1.25
million) for damage to her reputation.
	   ``The atmosphere has been poisoned. In this atmosphere no fair
trial is possible,'' Ms. Bhutto said as she left the provincial
high court in Karachi. ``The future of my political life, my
liberty, the future of my political party _ Everything is at
stake.''
	   Aides to Rehman said he was not immediately available for
comment.
	   After defeating Ms. Bhutto in 1997 elections, Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif established an anti-corruption team to investigate
allegations that Ms. Bhutto and her family siphoned off millions of
dollars from the state. Ms. Bhutto has since been indicted in
several cases.
	   Ms. says Sharif's accusations are groundless and his government
is conducting a witch hunt.

IMF official in Moscow to discuss loan package
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A senior International Monetary Fund official has
come to Russia to check up on a huge international loan and
economic reforms that were demanded in exchange for the cash
infusion.
	   Stanley Fisher, first deputy managing director of the fund,
arrived in Moscow on Friday and was scheduled to hold talks with
Russian leaders, including Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and
Anatoly Chubais, the government's envoy to international lending
institutions.
	   Russian markets remain skittish, despite the dlrs 22.6 billion
bailout, unconvinced the government can implement reforms and
address fundamental problems in the economy.
	   The Communist-dominated parliament opposes many of the reforms
and the government has been forced to implement some by decree.
	   ``The purpose of the visit (by Fisher) is to review the
IMF-supported program,'' and IMF spokesman said in Washington on
Thursday. ``He is not there to discuss extra money.''
	   Fisher's visit had not been expected, coming only 11 days after
the IMF approved its part of the bailout package. But there did not
appear to be any major problems up for discussion.
	   Fisher was scheduled to have dinner Friday night with Central
Bank chairman Sergei Dubinin and hold meetings on Saturday with the
aggressive new chairman of the State Taxation Service, Boris
Fyodorov, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Poor tax collection is one of the major problems of the Russian
economy. However, Fyodorov said Friday the government collected 500
million rubles (dlrs 80.6 million) more in taxes in July than the
11.2 billion rubles (dlrs 1.8 billion) it collected in June.
	   Fisher is to meet Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov on Saturday
before returning to the United States.

Media tycoon gives stakes in the paper to pay bank debts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ The government became the biggest
shareholder in the country's second-largest daily, after media
mogul Miroslav Kutle sold off his share to pay huge debts owed to a
state-owned bank, media reported Friday.
	   Kutle ceded his 35-percent stake and controlling package in
Slobodna Dalmacija daily to the government to part of the dlrs 130
million he owes to Dubrovacka Banka.
	   Kutle admitted to Croatian television the government had
insisted on his shares in the paper as payment for his debts in the
state-owned Dubrovacka Banka. The bank was the country's
fifth-largest, until it was discovered in late March that a risky
credit portfolio and management corruption had left it more that
1.5 billion kuna (nearly a quarter-billion dollars) in debt.
	   The scope of the mismanagement shocked the Croatian public and
independent newspapers indicated that some government and police
officials were implicated in the bank's shady businesses.
	   Analysts charged that the sordid alliance between politicians
and businessmen enabled tycoons, like Kutle, to expand their
empires.
	   The government intervened _ detaining the bank's chief director
on charges of fraud, embezzlement and bailing out the bank at the
taxpayers' expense _ and essentially took over the bank.
	   Dubrovnik's oppositional mayor, Vido Bogdanovic, charged the the
government had all along intended to control the region, otherwise
ruled by the opposition, through the bank.
	   Although many doubted that the government would touch Kutle _
who was close to some of President Franjo Tudjman's government
officials _ it appeared that he either fell from grace or that the
government was simply interested in taking control over another
newspaper.
	   Kutle, who rose virtually overnight from a small restaurant
owner to a media mogul with majority shares in industries, will
also have to sell some of his properties to cover the rest of his
debts.
	   In addition to its major share in Slobodna Dalmacija, Tudjman's
government controls the only nation-wide television and radio and
two dailies.
	   Ivana Trump owns 33 percent of the paper, with the remaining
shares going to employees of the daily.
	   The daily's reporters and editors had no immediate comment.

Turkey pledges to use influence over Israel for Mideast peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with comments from Turkish, Palestinian
leaders &QL;

 &UR; By SUZAN FRASER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey on Friday blamed Israel for the
stalled Middle East peace talks and pledged to use its influence
with the Jewish state to get the process moving again.
	   ``It is policies that cannot be condoned that have lead to the
failure of the Middle East peace process,'' President Suleyman
Demirel told reporters after a meeting here with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
	   Demirel said Turkey would give its ``full support to the
Palestinian cause.''
	   Turkey and Israel have been developing close strategic ties
since 1996, exchanging warplanes for training, conducting naval
maneuvers and sealing several defense and trade ties.
	   Middle East peace talks between Palestinian and Israeli
negotiators stalled when Arafat called them off to until Israel
accepts an American peace proposal for Israel to gradually withdraw
troops from parts of the West Bank. The plan also requires
Palestinians to crack down on Islamic militants.
	   Arafat arrived in Ankara Friday morning from an Islamic
Conference meeting in Morocco discussing the future of Jerusalem.
Palestinians accuse Israel of violating accords by making
unilateral decisions on the city.
	   The Palestinian leader on Friday repeated concerns over
increased efforts toward the ``Judaization'' of Jerusalem.
	   ``We appreciate continuing efforts to prevent the Judaization of
Al Qods (Jerusalem),'' Arafat said. ``I hope that we will meet in
(Jerusalem) and to pray together.''
	   A Turkish official speaking on condition of anonymity said
Arafat also asked for Turkish support for the establishment of an
Islamic cultural center in Jerusalem.
	   Arafat was scheduled to fly to Paris Saturday.

Court lifts seizure of telecommunications shares linked to Marcos
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine Supreme Court on
Friday lifted the 12-year-old seizure of shares of Philippine Long
Distance Telephone Co. following its decision to remove government
control on Prime Holdings Inc.
	   Prime Holdings was seized by the government in 1986 on
allegations it forms part of the ill-gotten wealth of the late
dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
	   The Supreme Court decision was the latest blow to the
government's efforts to recover several billion dollars it claims
were amassed illegally during Marcos' 20-year rule, which ended in
1986.
	   Prime Holdings owns about 46 percent of Philippine
Telecommunications Investment Corp., which holds around 21 percent
of PLDT, the country's largest telecommunications company.
	   PTIC is the single largest shareholder in PLDT. Through the
seizure of Prime Holdings the government had managed to seat its
representatives on PLDT's board.
	   Around 35 percent of PLDT's shares are American Depository
Receipts listed in New York, nearly 28 percent are listed on the
Philippine Stock Exchange, and the rest are held by employees and
other minority shareholders.
	   The Supreme Court lifted the seizure of the shares on the ground
the order from the Presidential Commission on Good Government, the
government agency tasked to recover Marcos' alleged ill-gotten
wealth, to seize Prime Holdings was flawed and that the agency
failed to file appropriate charges within the six-month period
prescribed by law.
	   The PCGG filed charges only in April 1990, more than three years
after the property's seizure.
	   The anti-graft court which has primary jurisdiction over the
ill-gotten wealth cases had ruled in late 1993 that the seizure was
improper. The PCGG appealed that order to the Supreme Court.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ After reports the U.N. refugee agency was losing
millions of dollars because of bad management, senior officials
said Friday its chief was considering seeking reappointment.
	   High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata is prepared to carry
on in the post for at least a shortened term when the post comes up
for re-election this December, UNHCR's Assistant High Commissioner
Soren Jessen-Petersen told reporters Friday. If Ogata, a former
academic from Japan, remains for another two years, she will have
been head of the agency for ten years.
	   ``That's what we all want, that's what governments want and that
is what she's prepared to consider,'' Jessen-Petersen said.
	   Governments had already approached Ogata to consider staying on
in the post, Jessen-Petersen said.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan expressed support Wednesday
for Ogata following a report in the London-based Financial Times
that its research and an independent auditors' report highlight
``serious failings'' in UNHCR's financial management. The report
alleged management incompetence, dubious accounting and possibly
fraud.
	   At a news conference, Jessen-Petersen conceded that the
organization suffered from institutional shortcomings ``and at
times mismanagement.''
	   ``This is an organization that in any event would be difficult
to manage without shortcomings and problems here and there,''
Jessen-Petersen said. ``Not all of us every day are Ogata's
angels.''
	   In particular, the agency had identified numerous shortcomings
in its management and operations in Guinea and other countries in
West Africa, he said. In Guinea, financial problems had been found
in the agency's dealings with its local partner organizations. But
those and other problems are being addressed, Jessen-Petersen said.
	   ``It has been a weak operation and yes, indeed, we are dealing
with it now,'' he said.
	   Donor countries have expressed concern about the newspaper
reports. The British government has said it feels there is scope
for improvement in some areas of UNHCR's operations.
	   UNHCR, at its own request, is meeting with governments Friday to
clarify UNHCR's position regarding the allegations, Jessen-Petersen
said. ``We don't think we are in a position where we have to defend
(ourselves),'' he said. ``But we have to explain so that donors can
maintain the trust and the confidence which ... many of them on the
phone have already told us they have.''

Scientist says West swapped chemical secrets with apartheid state

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) - The mastermind behind a secret
chemical and biological warfare program on Friday said Western
countries, including the United States, swapped sensitive military
information with apartheid South Africa.
	   Dr. Wouter Basson, whose scientists made poisons for government
assassins and allegedly researched a bacteria to only kill black
people, told the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that Western
governments gave him helpful information as he sought to set up the
program in the early 1980s.
	   Dubbed ``Dr. Death'' by local media, Basson described attending
a 1981 conference in San Antonio, Texas, with army officers from
the United States, West Germany, Japan, Britain and Canada.
	   Truth Commission lawyer Hanif Vally asked Basson if during the
conference U.S. officials had told him about their own chemical and
biological warfare programs in an ``incredible amount of detail.''
	   ``That is correct,'' replied Basson, without elaborating.
	   The commission produced notes Basson made at the conference
which described meetings with senior U.S. army officers where
issues surrounding chemical and biological warfare were discussed.
	   One U.S. officer told Basson Africa's hot climate made it an
ideal arena for chemical weapons, because they would be absorbed
more effectively by sweating soldiers whose heart rates would be
higher.
	   During the Cold War with the East Bloc, Western government
officials and army officers were so open because they wanted
details on the chemical warfare capability of Soviet-backed
countries neighboring South Africa, Basson said.
	   ``That was why I had good access to senior government officials
and people at that time,'' he said.
	   Basson testified on the last day of the commission's mandate. He
faces trial in a criminal court on charges ranging from drug
possession to conspiracy to murder.
	   At the hearings in June, scientists working for Basson described
plotting to poison President Nelson Mandela, who spent 27 years as
a prisoner of the white-run state, and hoarding enough supplies of
deadly anthrax and cholera to cause epidemics.
	   Basson denied much of the testimony by his former employees,
claiming he had actually helped save Mandela's life.
	   Basson said army chiefs warned him in the mid-1980s of a plot by
radical elements in the African National Congress to kill Mandela,
who was in jail at the time, because he was too moderate.
	   To thwart the plan Basson said he set up one team to look at
ways of attacking Mandela and another to investigate protecting
him. The results were then combined to provide him with security.
	   ``The political leaders of that time saved his life,'' Basson
said.
	   Basson denied authorizing his scientists to develop ways of
reducing black women's fertility or researching a bacteria that
would only kill black people.
	   Set up a year after 1994 all-race elections ended apartheid, the
Truth Commission is charged with uncovering the facts about
atrocities committed by all sides in the fight against white rule.

Kabila orders 234 prisoners freed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ President Laurent Desire Kabila has
decided to release 234 prisoners from Kinshasa's central prison, a
Justice Ministry official said Friday.
	   Among the prisoners to be released are children and women, many
of whom are malnourished or ill.
	   The decision was taken as part of a prison reform program that
Kabila has been discussing since coming to power in May 1997,
Justice Ministry spokesman Banza Tiefolo said.
	   The release and reform program will be extended to other parts
of the country, he said.
	   the central Kinshasa prison, known previously as the Makala
prison, has been used by Kabila in large part to house war
prisoners for reeducation purposes. Homeless children and beggars,
however, are also sent to the prison after police sweeps through
the capital's poverty-riddled streets.
	   Kabila came to power after his rebel army ousted longtime
Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. Thousands of Mobutu soldiers and
some former government officials were shunted off to reeducation
camps in Kinshasa and in eastern Congo after the turnover.
	   The government says it has released most of the wartime
prisoners, although some human rights groups say several thousand
remain in reeducation camps.
	   Kabila is also accused of jailing dozens of political opponents,
journalists and human rights critics since coming to power.

Thief steals marble dog's head from Uffizi Gallery

<TEXT>
	   FLORENCE, Italy (AP) _ A thief mingling among tourists at the
Uffizi Gallery stole the tiny marble head of a dog from an ancient
sarcophagus, museum officials said Friday.
	   The stolen piece, the size of a table-tennis ball and with
little commercial value, was pried off the coffin of a Roman
general dating to the second century.
	   A tourist, a French woman, saw the man take the piece two hours
before closing time Thursday evening and alerted security guards,
but the thief slipped away.
	   Italy's vast art treasures in museums and churches have been
plagued by thieves.
	   In one of the biggest thefts, thieves stole two van Goghs and a
Cezanne from the National Gallery of Modern Art in Rome in May. The
paintings, valued together at dlrs 30 million, were recovered this
month and eight people were arrested.
	   Florence's art superintendent, Antonio Paolucci, denied that a
security breakdown allowed the theft.
	   ``No museum can be 100 percent protected,'' he said.
	   Paolucci said the stolen piece was worth no more than 3 million
lire (dlrs 1,700). The dog's head had recently been re-attached to
the sarcophagus during a restoration.

Police keep militants out of newspaper over Khomeini criticism
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Police Friday prevented Islamic militants
from entering the offices of a newspaper that published a letter
critical of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
	   About 30 baton-wielding policemen stood around the offices of
the weekly Khaneh to prevent attacks by the militants who on Monday
threw a petrol bomb at the paper's office and made threatening
phone calls to the editors.
	   Khaneh's managing director, Mohammad-Reza Za'eri, was arrested
this week for printing the letter that authorities said insulted
``Islamic sanctities'' and Khomeini, the leader of Iran's 1979
Islamic revolution.
	   About a dozen militants allied with hard-liners in Iran's
Islamic government tried to enter the building, but were stopped by
police. Their leader argued with police but left without trouble.
	   Khomeini, who also led Iran in the 1980-88 war with Iraq, is
portrayed almost as a saint by the clergy in Iran and any criticism
of Khomeini has been taboo.
	   But in a daring act, Khaneh recently published a letter that has
become the talk of the town. The newspaper did not identify the
writer, describing her as a young woman.
	   ``When I think of Khomeini, all that comes to mind are the
horrifying sounds of the midnight bombs that used to fall on Tehran
and the blood of thousands of innocent young Iranians who died in
that war'' with Iraq, the woman wrote in the letter to Khaneh.
	   She added: ``Do you call me to follow someone who has
transformed Iran into an international terrorist state with his
order to murder Salman Rushdie?''
	   Khomeini said it was the religious duty of Muslims worldwide to
kill Rushdie for insulting Islam in his novel ``The Satanic
Verses.'' Iran put a bounty on Rushdie's head.
	   The publication of the letter and the remarks against Khomeini
are the result of a free press policy being pushed by Iran's
President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate cleric who came to power a
year ago. But he has met strong and often successful opposition
from hard-line clergymen in the government.
	   ``Some people, as soon as they smell a bit of freedom, think
they can do whatever they want,'' the hard-line chief judge
Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi said Friday.
	   ``If anyone tries to insult Islam and the imam (Khomeini), the
nation will not tolerate it,'' Yazdi told worshipers at a Tehran
University prayer sermon.

IMF official in Moscow to discuss loan package
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quote, CORRECTS spelling of Fischer. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A senior International Monetary Fund official has
come to Russia to check up on a huge international loan and
economic reforms that were demanded in exchange for the cash
infusion.
	   Stanley Fischer, first deputy managing director of the fund,
arrived in Moscow on Friday and was scheduled to hold talks with
Russian leaders, including Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and
Anatoly Chubais, the government's envoy to international lending
institutions.
	   Russian markets remain skittish, despite the dlrs 22.6 billion
bailout, unconvinced the government can implement reforms and
address fundamental problems in the economy.
	   The Communist-dominated parliament opposes many of the reforms
and the government has been forced to implement some by decree.
	   ``He is on a working visit to assess together with the Russians
whether everything that needs to be done to insure implementation
of the program is indeed being done,'' said Martin Gilman, head of
the IMF's Moscow office.
	   Fischer's visit comes only 11 days after the IMF approved its
part of the bailout package, but there did not appear to be any
major problems up for discussion.
	   Fischer was scheduled to have dinner Friday night with Central
Bank chairman Sergei Dubinin and hold meetings on Saturday with the
aggressive new chairman of the State Taxation Service, Boris
Fyodorov, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Poor tax collection is one of the major problems of the Russian
economy. However, Fyodorov said Friday the government collected 500
million rubles (dlrs 80.6 million) more in taxes in July than the
11.2 billion rubles (dlrs 1.8 billion) it collected in June.
	   Fischer is to meet Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov on Saturday
before returning to the United States.

Gonzalez says dirty war conviction of minister radically unjust
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Former premier Felipe Gonzalez described as
radically unjust a Supreme Court verdict that found a former
minister of his guilty of dirty war activities and alleged the
court had been under pressure from the current conservative
government, news reports said Friday.
	   In his first public reaction to Wednesday's verdict, the Spanish
news agency Europa Press cited Gonzalez as saying he would back
convicted former Interior Minister Jose Luis Barrionuevo and his
former deputy Rafael Vera until the end.
	   Barrionuevo and Vera were both sentenced to 10 years in jail
after being found guilty along with 10 others of the 1983
kidnapping of French businessman Segundo Marey who had been
mistaken for a hitman from the Basque separatist group ETA.
	   Of the 12 defendants, only Barrionuevo and Vera had pleaded
innocent.
	   Marey's abduction was the first action attributed to the
so-called GAL death squad that killed 27 people between 1983 and
1987 in its pursuit of ETA members and sympathizers. Many of its
victims turned out to be mistaken targets.
	   Gonzalez has long denied allegations that his governments set up

greatly to his Socialist party's defeat in elections in 1996 after
nearly 14 years in office.

Gonzalez denied his governments had anything to do with the death
squads. He has long contended that the affair is part of a plot

former Socialist leader.

Newspaper report: new clues in SilkAir crash suicide theory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead; Edits thruout.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The captain of a doomed SilkAir jet was deeply
in debt, had recently taken out a huge life insurance policy and
had previously tampered with cockpit voice and instrument
recorders, according to a newspaper report Friday.
	   The pilot's background and an eerie coincidence in the timing of
the jet's fatal plunge on Dec. 19 have fueled speculation that the
pilot intentionally crashed the plane in a suicide attempt.
	   The Asian Wall Street Journal reported that Capt. Tsu Way Ming,
the Singaporean pilot of the SilkAir jet that crashed over Sumatra
killing all 104 people aboard, had taken out an insurance policy on
his life worth several million dollars just days before the crash.
	   The captain, who left behind a widow and three children, is
reported to have been heavily in debt from speculating on
securities, the newspaper said, citing unidentified investigators
and people close to the crash probe.
	   One of the most puzzling aspects of the Boeing 737 crash is that
the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder stopped working
minutes before impact. Without the information, there were no clues
as to what the crew and the aircraft were doing in the moments
before it plunged at supersonic speed into a Sumatran river.
	   Investigators have announced publicly that the engine was still
running as it hit the ground, a scenario that could be explained if
the nose had been aimed down to deliberately crash the plane.
	   Suggestions that the troubled Tsu may have committed suicide,
and covered it up by turning off the cockpit's recorders, were
first raised by Aviation Week magazine early this year and have
been followed up by other newspapers. Indonesian, Singaporean and
American investigators have refused to publicly confirm most of the
details in the reports.
	   The Journal reported that Tsu had recently erased the cockpit
voice recorder in an aircraft to cover up a mistake. The action
caused the co-pilot in that previous incident to make a formal
complaint, leading to Tsu's demotion and ruining his chances to
move up to SilkAir's prestigious and better-paying parent company,
Singapore Airlines, the Journal reported.
	   The Journal reported that Tsu could have disabled the recorders
on the fatal SilkAir flight at a panel in the back of the cockpit,
unseen by co-pilot Duncan Ward of New Zealand, if he was flying at
the time.
	   Finally, the Journal reported, Dec. 19 _ the day of the SilkAir
crash _ was the same day that four of Tsu's flying buddies in the
Singapore Air Force had died smashing into a Philippine
mountainside during an acrobatic training mission 18 years before.
Because of a mechanical problem, Tsu had turned back, and thus
survived that mission.
	   While 80 percent of the SilkAir jet has been recovered,
investigators have reported no indication of a bomb, and no
apparent malfunction.

ASEAN should protest against harassment of opposition leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's Democratic Action Party
called on southeast Asian countries to strongly protest the Myanmar
government's treatment of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
	   In a statement issued Friday, the party's secretary-general and
Parliamentary opposition leader Lim Kit Siang said Malaysia and
other countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
should show the world that they are concerned about the
deteriorating human rights situation in Myanmar.
	   They should deplore the military junta's ``kidnapping'' of Suu
Kyi to end her six-day car sit-in protest against violation of her
fundamental right to free movement in her own country, the
statement said.
	   Suu Kyi reportedly said the Yangoon government ``kidnapped'' her
to end the standoff, saying police held her down, took the wheel of
her car and forcibly drove her back to the capital, the statement
reported.
	   Leaders of the National League of Democracy said Suu Kyi had
been determined to continue the standoff until the military agreed
to open a dialogue with her and her party, something the generals
have refused to do, the statement said.
	   ASEAN groups Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Laos,
Myanmar, Brunei, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Torrential rains leave 14 dead, hundreds homeless
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Water from a dam breached by torrential
rains flooded a village in western Sudan, killing 14 people and
leaving 450 families homeless, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   The Sharia village in Darfur state was under 3 feet (1 meter)
water after the flood Thursday, the government's Al-Anbaa said.
	   It did not elaborate on the number of homeless, but seven people
in family is not unusual in rural Sudan.
	   The government declared a state of emergency in Darfur and will
distribute food and medical aid to the victims, it said.
	   Earlier this week, torrential rains destroyed 1,000 homes in the
town of Fashir, also in Darfur. No casualty figures were available.

Japan's oldest person dies at 114
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's oldest person, Asa Takii, died Friday at a
nursing home in southwestern Japan, the nursing home's director
said. She was 114.
	   Takii was born in Hiroshima in April 28, 1884. Her lifetime
encompassed almost the entire span of Japan's history as a modern
nation.
	   She witnessed her country's rise as an imperial power, its
crushing defeat in World War II and its resurgence as the world's
second-largest economy.
	   She lived in Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, when the United States
dropped the world's first atomic bomb. The blast killed her husband
and family and buried her in the rubble of her home until she was
found days later.
	   Takii kept her memories of the war to herself, said Kumiko
Nishiki, director of Tachibana-en nursing home on Kurahashi island
in Hiroshima prefecture, 670 kilometers (420 miles) southwest of
Tokyo.
	   Takii died of heart complications stemming from high blood
pressure, Nishiki said.
	   Takii's death leaves Tokyo-resident Tase Matunaga, also 114, as
Japan's oldest person, Kyodo News reported.
	   Japanese have the world's longest life expectancy _ 83 years for
women and 77 years for men, according to the Health and Welfare
Ministry.

Britain ratifies land mine convention
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates with Britain completes ratification, Cook quotes,
trims &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain formally ratified the international treaty
against land mines on Friday and extended its existing moratorium
to a total ban.
	   On July 10, under pressure to show support for Princess Diana's
final campaign against land mines before the anniversary of her
death Aug. 31, the House of Commons rushed through a bill ratifying
the Ottawa Convention banning their use. On Friday Britain
completed the process by depositing the instrument of ratification
with the United Nations secretary-general in New York.
	   The convention will not come into effect for some months, until
at least 40 of the more than 120 signatories have ratified it.
	   ``We have kept our promise to be among the first 40 countries to
ratify the Ottawa Convention and bring it into force,'' Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook said. ``Britain will remain at the forefront
of the campaign to rid the world of anti-personnel landmines.
	   ``We must now persuade those countries which have not signed and
ratified to do so,'' he said. ``We must also dedicate ourselves to
removing the humanitarian threat posed by the millions of mines
already in the ground. Our goal is a world free of anti-personnel
landmines.''
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's government had imposed a moratorium
on the operational use of anti-personnel land mines by British
forces in May. An exemption was allowed for the weapons' use in
exceptional circumstances, such as to defend an occupied zone.
	   That exemption was removed on Friday and Defense Secretary
George Robertson said that a total ban was being implemented to
send a ``clear signal'' to the rest of the world.
	   More than 120 countries signed the treaty, known as the Ottawa
Convention, in the Canadian capital in December, but it will not
come into force for at least nine more months. It has to be
ratified by a minimum of 40 countries.
	   Half of Britain's 1 million landmines have already been
destroyed.

U.S. envoy: Terrorism will not stop the country from moving

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Those spreading fear among
Bosnia's population through terrorist attacks before the September
elections ``are fighting against the tide of history,'' a U.S.
official said Friday.
	   The official, Robert Gelbard, was referring to a number of
explosions that have occurred in the country during the run up to
the September balloting. The election will determine who will run
the country for the next four years.
	   ``This country is now approaching a critical moment for it's
future ... and will be a determining factor for the future and the
people of this country,'' Gelbard said.
	   But he was confident people ``in their wisdom'' will not be
distracted by recent increased bomb attacks an intimidations.
	   The most recent blast occurred Friday in the central Bosnian
town of Travnik, where a bomb killed a policemen.
	   Gelbard said he would visit Travnik Friday afternoon to express
his support for those who prefer a multiethnic and democratic
country.
	   The Friday blast was the fifth in Bosnia in the past week. No
arrests have been made.
	   Gelbard said the violence was ``extremely serious, dangerous and
tragic,'' clearly ``an effort on a part of a number of various
groups to intimidate and cause fear among the population.''
	   Despite such problems, Gelbard said the United States believed
there had been enormous changes for the good since the end of the
1992-1995 ethnic conflict.
	   He said the elections could still prove to be the freest and
fairest in Bosnia's brief history as an independent country.
	   Gelbard dismissed speculation that the United States had
accepted the long term division of Bosnia into Serb, Muslim and
Croat entities.
	   ``Our goal remains the same: single state of Bosnia-Herzegovina
composed of two multiethnic entities,'' Gelbard said.
	   He accused the Serb member of the joint Bosnian presidency,
Momcilo Krajisnik, as well as indicted war crimes suspect Radovan
Karadzic, of spreading rumors about U.S. support for Bosnian
partition.
	   ``This is a lie, just as they lie about so much else,'' Gelbard
said.

Gonzalez says `dirty war' conviction of minister was unjust
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Former premier Felipe Gonzalez described as
radically unjust a Supreme Court verdict that found one of his
former officials guilty of ``dirty war'' activities and claimed
that the current government had pressured the court, news reports
said Friday.
	   In his first public response to Wednesday's verdict, the Spanish
news agency Europa Press cited Gonzalez as saying he would back
convicted former Interior Minister Jose Luis Barrionuevo and his
former deputy, Rafael Vera, until the end.
	   Barrionuevo and Vera were both sentenced to 10 years in prison
after being found guilty along with 10 others of the 1983
kidnapping of French businessman Segundo Marey, who had been
mistaken for a hitman from the Basque separatist group ETA.
	   Of the 12 defendants, only Barrionuevo and Vera pleaded
innocent.
	   Marey's abduction was the first action attributed to the
so-called GAL death squad that killed 27 people between 1983 and
1987 in its pursuit of ETA members and sympathizers. Many of its
victims turned out to be mistaken targets.
	   Gonzalez has long denied allegations that his governments set up
and ran the GAL. The scandal and other controversies contributed
heavily to his Socialist party's defeat in elections in 1996 after
nearly 14 years in office.
	   As a witness during the 22-day trial which ended July 14,
Gonzalez denied that his governments had anything to do with the
death squads. He has long contended that the affair is part of a
plot orchestrated by members and supporters of the conservative
government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar against the
charismatic former Socialist leader.

Official: High birth rate may lead to population explosion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan's population is expected to reach
seven million by 2010 due to a growth rate of 4.4 percent per year,
the highest in the Arab World, an official was reported as saying
Friday.
	   The Jordan Times quoted Labor Minister Mohammed Mehdi Farhan as
saying the kingdom's population has increased eight-fold since
1952.
	   Farhan said 40 percent of Jordan's 4.6 million people are below
15 years of age, and expressed hope that Jordanians realize the
need to control the birth rate to promote the standard of living.
	   ``Rapid population growth and high fertility hold back economic
development and help increase and perpetuate poverty and
joblessness,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   Despite high cost of living and an unemployment rate estimated
at over 15 percent, birth rate among poor people is higher than
among the well off, said Farhan, who also is the chairman of the
National Population Commission.
	   He said traditional and religious opposition to birth control
contribute to the high birth rate.
	   In a bid to counter that, the health ministry has launched a
campaign on state television to promote birth control methods, the
Times said.
	   The newspaper did not give the birth rates in other Middle
Eastern countries.
	   Farhan said the world population is expected to reach six
billion next year, a figure that could have been much higher if
planning measures had not been introduced.
	   The world population is increasing by about 81 million every
year. The growth rate was 53 million in the 1960s.

Three people dead, 20 wounded, in Algiers bomb attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ A powerful bomb exploded Friday in a
market in Algiers, killing three people and wounding 20 others. It
was the second deadly explosion in the capital in two days.
	   Authorities said the bomb, hidden in a crate of vegetables,
exploded at a market near Kouba, in the southern outskirts of
Algiers.
	   Nobody claimed responsibility for the attack, but such bombings
are usually blamed on Islamic militants waging a violent insurgency
against the military-backed government.
	   The violence came as a U.N. fact-finding mission into the
violence that has continued unabated in Algeria for the last six
years continued its work.
	   On Thursday, a bomb exploded in a bus in a suburb of the
Algerian capital, killing two people and wounding 15 others. The
bomb was concealed in a plastic bag that had been placed behind one
of the seats.
	   The U.N. panel, led by former Portuguese President Mario Soares,
arrived in Algeria last week to look into the insurgency that was
sparked in 1992 after the government canceled parliamentary
elections an Islamic party was set to win.
	   Some 75,000 people have died in the last six years.
	   The U.N. mission is expected to spend about two weeks in
Algeria.

Spared by arbitration ruling AEK prepares to face Ferencvaros
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Thankful it still has a place in the UEFA Cup, AEK
Athens will be the third Greek team in three years to face
Hungary's Ferencvaros when they meet in next month's second
qualifying round.
	   Ferencvaros ousted Olympiakos two years ago and lost to OFI
Crete last year, and Friday's draw means a trip to Athens Aug 28
after the first leg in Budapest on the 11th.
	   But AEK, seeded to go straight into the second qualifying round,
very nearly didn't make it at all.
	   Because AEK and Slavia Prague are controlled by the same British
company, ENIC, UEFA wanted to avoid a conflict of interest by
kicking one of them out of the competition
	   AEK owes its guaranteed participation in the competition to a
ruling by a court of arbitration which suspended UEFA's ruling for
a year. So does Slavia, which crosses the border into Slovakia to
face Inter Bratislava, once a rival in the old Czechoslovak league
when both nations were joined.
	   AEK's media director, Nikos Katsaros, said the club felt ``very
lucky'' to play in the UEFA Cup after the court of arbitration's
ruling it should be reinstated.
	   The decision on postponing UEFA's new ownership rule for a year
was ``a good one for us. In the meantime, in four months there'll
be another discussion in another court where we will appeal for
UEFA to withdraw its decision,'' Katsaros said.
	   ``It's a very big relief for us because our club is under a lot
of pressure from the Greek public and media.''
	   Another Greek club, PAOK Salonika, has a tough matchup with
wealthy Glasgow Rangers.
	   It's a pairing that could go either way with Rangers, reshaping
under new Dutch coach Dick Advocaat, out to prove it can still get
results without midfielder Paul Gascoigne, who's gone to
Middlesbrough, and Brian Laudrup, who now plays for Chelsea.
	   ``This is a very tough draw for us.'' said Rangers' chief
executive Bob Brannan. ``It's very exciting to play in Greece.
Greek football is on the up so obviously it's going to be tough.''
	   ``We're very happy to be playing in Greece but not happy to be
playing PAOK.''
	   For Polish clubs, the draw was overshadowed by the threat of
FIFA and UEFA suspending Poland if its soccer federation and
government don't sort out their differences by Aug. 7, four days
before the first legs.
	   Wisla Krakow, which trounced Welsh soccer minnow Newtown 7-0 on
Wednesday, faces Turkey's Trabzonspor, which has just hired
talented English striker Kevin Campbell.
	   ``It's a very difficult draw because (Trabzonspor) are one of
the best teams in Turkey and the bigger problem is the fight
between the federation and the government,'' said Wisla president
Ludwik Mietta-Mikolajewicz.
	   ``The problem is we don't know if we will play because of the
deadline of Aug. 7. For the players it is very nervous and
disappointing.''
	   He said presidents of Polish clubs playing in Europe, the
national federation and the government will meet Monday in Warsaw.
``We will do our best to make a compromise and finish this
situation,'' Mietta-Mikolajewicz said.
	   ``I'm positive this situation will be resolved,'' said Polonia
Warsaw's sport manager, Vladyslav George Engel, whose team meets
Dinamo Moscow. Both sides are showing ``good will,'' he said.

Industrial output declines by 5.5 percent in one month

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania's industry continued its
downward spiral, dropping by 5.5 percent from May to June, the
National Statistics Commission reported on Friday.
	   In the first six months of 1998, industrial output fell 20
percent compared with the same period of last year, the Commission
report added.
	   An overvalued currency has stymied exports and production.
Investment in Romania's communist-era industry is seen as
unprofitable.
	   Political instability and government bureaucracy have kept
foreign investors away. Since the fall of Communism in December
1989 only dlrs 3.15 billion have been invested while neighboring
Hungary, which has half Romania's population some dlrs 17 billion
have been invested in the same period.
	   Romania's average monthly inflation dropped to 3.7 percent for
the first six months of this year, compared to a monthly average of
12.4 percent last year.
	   The average salary rose by 4.1 percent since May reaching 1.04
million lei (dlrs 119).

	   ANTALYA, Turkey (AP) _ A U.S. crewman injured during a fatal
crash between two Navy jets over the Mediterranean was in stable
condition Friday following a three-hour operation, hospital
officials said.
	   The airman, identified by University Hospital in Antalya as
William Kane, underwent surgery for a broken leg and was expected
to be discharged within three days, said Dr. Ahmet Turan Aydin, who
performed the operation.
	   After Thursday's collision, one of the two F-14 Tomcats made it
safely back to the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower. But
the other crashed while flying to Antalya for an emergency landing,
said Lt. Greg Geisen, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy's public
affairs office in Gaeta, Italy.
	   The two crew members in the plane that crashed ejected, Geisen
said, and both were flown back to the Eisenhower, where medical
staff declared one of the aviators dead.
	   Lt. Cmdr. Ernst Duplessis of the Eisenhower's public affairs
office said the name of the deceased crew member would be released
at the carrier's base in Norfolk, Virginia, after notification of
next of kin. He did he confirm the name of the injured crew member.
	   ``The entire command is saddened by the loss of one of our
shipmates,'' he said.
	   Navy chaplains were dispersed throughout the ship late Thursday
to provide counseling to the troops. ``(They were) the listening
ear we needed,'' Duplessis said.
	   Duplessis told reporters that a search had been launched to
retrieve the wreckage and that an investigation was under way to
determine the cause of the accident.
	   According to the U.S. Embassy in Ankara, the collision occurred
about 10 miles (16 kilometers) off the coast, in Turkish
territorial waters.
	   The USS Eisenhower had been in the Mediterranean just over a
month and was 150 miles (240 kilometers) southwest of Antalya at
the time of the crash. The aircraft carrier, which was due to begin
a one-week call in Antalya Friday, anchored outside the port as
scheduled.

German language reform takes effect, but critics still fighting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with government minister defending changes &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The controversial German language reform
officially takes effect Saturday. But despite a green light from
Germany's highest court, few are rushing to make the switch.
	   Critics complain the new rules, intended to simplify the way
German is written, actually make things more complicated and were
still pushing Friday to at least delay their implementation.
	   Opponents could still throw a wrench in the works if they win a
state referendum on the reform in Schleswig-Holstein on Sept. 27.
	   But it's unclear exactly what impact the referendum could have,
since Germany's highest court already upheld on July 14 the
government's right to make the changes.
	   Many schools have already adopted the new rules, agreed to in
1996 by officials of German-speaking countries.
	   But many government bureaucrats, who are also supposed to start
writing the new way at work, are balking. Half of the 16 states say
they won't be ready with new forms and computer programs by
Saturday anyway and are putting off the switch.
	   Most newspapers and news agencies are waiting until after the
referendum to decide what they will do.
	   ``How many work hours, how much energy will be put into this
chaos?'' asked one prominent opponent, Wolfgang Gerhardt, chairman
of the Free Democratic party.
	   But the head of the state culture and education ministers
conference, Gabriele Behler, insists the new rules are clearer and
better.
	   They make writing snappier by eliminating many comma rules.
``The man who came to dinner'' will no longer require a comma after
``man,'' for example.
	   It also separates many strung-together compound words _
``remainsitting'' becomes ``remain sitting'' _ and introduces more
Germanized spellings for foreign words, like ``Ketschup'' for
``Ketchup'' and ``Komminikee'' for ``Kommunique,'' or communique.
	   The Austrians and Swiss have generally accepted them, but many
leading authors and ordinary citizens in Germany say they object to
tampering with the language of Goethe and Schiller.
	   Although school textbooks have already been reprinted to adopt
the new way of writing, many authors have demanded excerpts from
their works that appear in the books remain as originally written.
	   Gerhardt, whose party is part of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
coalition government, said the reform should be delayed to allow
linguists, writers and literary experts a say on the changes.
	   ``Then they could take effect when they've been corrected enough
so that they are generally accepted as a real improvement,'' he
said.
	   But Behler, the education minister from North Rhine-Westphalia
state, noted that the old way of writing will still be considered
acceptable until July 31, 2005. And even after that, the rules are
only binding on students and in government offices.
	   ``Anyone can write however he wants and however he thinks that
he will be understood,'' she said. ``Whoever uses the old way of
writing therefore won't be wrong, but rather traditional.''

	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Rival faction leaders from north and
south Mogadishu have agreed on plan to set up the first inclusive
administration in the war-torn capital since the central government
was overthrown more than seven years ago.
	   The five-point plan was agreed to late Thursday after north
Mogadishu faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed and his main rival,
Hussein Hajji Bod, sat down with Hussein Mohamed Aidid and Osman
Ali Atto from south Mogadishu.
	   At the end of March, faction leaders from the two halves of the
city announced they had reached a similar agreement, but the deal
did not include Bod, who emerged subsequently as a rival to Ali
Mahdi.
	   The plan includes consolidating the two separate currencies
circulating in the northern and southern halves of the capital, the
opening of the main seaport and airport closed since 1995, the
restoration of Islamic law to deal with rampant crime and the
nomination of a technical committee to draw up laws to govern the
capital and the surrounding Benadir region.
	   The agreement came as the city's major businessmen and private
telecommunications operators set up a 100-man strong security force
to patrol the main Bakara market in south Mogadishu where armed
robbery, kidnapping and for-hire killings are threatening the
capital's economic heart.
	   The 100 security guards _ required to be healthy men between the
ages of 25 and 40 who neither drink alcohol nor chew the narcotic
leaf khat but own their own guns and have the backing of known
business people _ will earn 15,000 shillings or dlrs 2 a day.
	   Olympic and Al-Barakat provide international telecommunications
link-ups via satellite from Somalia to the rest of the world since
the national telecommunications system was destroyed in fighting in
1992-93.
	   They are located next to the sprawling, warren-like Bakara
market where most of the city's money-handling and changing takes
place.
	   Since the city split along clan lines in late 1992, two separate
types of shillings have been in circulation in the north and the
south. Under the agreement, the northern bal-yar and the southern
bal-weyn will be interchangeable.

Hakkinen fastest in free practice

<TEXT>
	   HOCKENHEIM, Germany (AP) _ Mika Hakkinen, seeking to increase
his Formula One championship lead over Michael Schumacher on
Schumacher's home circuit, set the fastest time Friday in free
practice for the German Grand Prix.
	   Hakkinen, coming off his victory at the Austrian Grand Prix five
days ago, takes an eight-point lead over Schumacher into Sunday's
race.
	   The Finn posted a time of one minute, 43.946 seconds on the
6.8-kilometer (4.2-mile) Hockenheimring in his McLaren-Mercedes.
	   ``We improved the car throughout the session and I am pleased
with the performance,'' Hakkinen said. Now we are concentrating on
setting the car up for tomorrow's qualifying but everything looks
very promising.''
	   On one of the fastest Formula One circuits, the McLarens are
believed to have an advantage with their powerful Mercedes engines.
	   Hakkinen's McLaren teammate David Coulthard had the second
fastest time Friday, clocking 1:44.138.
	   ``A trouble-free first day,'' Coulthard said. ``The only
characteristic in the car which we are trying to deal with is some
oversteer, but apart from that I am looking forward to tomorrow.''
	   Although Friday's free practice, usually used for testing tires
and set-ups of the cars, may not have much relevance for the
starting grid order, it indicated that the McLarens are primed for
the battle with the Ferraris of Schumacher and Eddie Irvine.
	   McLaren and Ferrari have been locked in a close battle since the
start of the season.
	   Hakkinen has won five races, Schumacher four and Coulthard one.
Six races are left in the season.
	   No other make has won a race this year. Hakkinen has 66 points
in the drivers' standings, Schumacher 58 and Coulthard 36.
	   Schumacher, a two-time champion with other makes, is seeking to
become the first Ferrari driver to win the championship since Jody
Scheckter in 1979. Neither Hakkinen nor Coulthard have ever won the
title.
	   ``I want to put Hakkinen under pressure and I think I have a
good chance of winning my home Grand Prix,'' said Schumacher, who
was the first German to win here in 1995.
	   ``McLaren has an advantage on this track, but we are not far
behind. It's going to be exciting,'' Schumacher said.
	   Although the championship could be beyond Coulthard's reach, he
could beat Schumacher for second place.
	   Hakkinen's victory in Austria snapped Schumacher's run of three
straight wins. With Coulthard second, it also gave McLaren its
fourth 1-2 finish of the season.
	   ``The red car (Ferrari) has been a challenger all year,''
Hakkinen said Thursday. ``But the top car at the moment is McLaren.
	   Schumacher will have the wild support from 150,000 fans that jam
into Hockenheim's huge grandstand. But for McLaren, it's also
something of a home race, through its alliance with Mercedes
engines.
	   Third in Friday's practice was former champion Damon Hill of
Britain, posting a time of 1:44.294 in his Jordan-Mugen Honda.
	   Jean Alesi of France in a Sauber-Petronas was fourth in
1:44.546, followed by the two Ferraris.
	   Schumacher was fifth in 1:44.757, while his teammate Eddie
Irvine was sixth in 1:44.780.
	   The starting grid will be decided in Saturday's qualifying.

	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ Artillery and mortars rained across the
disputed frontier of Kashmir, killing scores of Indian and
Pakistani civilians and soldiers, officials said Friday, as
diplomatic efforts broke down to revive negotiations on the
50-year-old territorial dispute.
	   Officials said 52 people were killed on both sides in one of the
heaviest exchanges of fire in years along the frontier, known as
the Line of Control.
	   India said Pakistani mortars slammed into a military hospital,
killing 16 civilians in the town of Tangdhar, some 200 meters
(yards) from the mountainous frontier and about 150 kilometers (90
miles) northwest of the provincial capital, Srinagar. The operating
theater and other areas of the field hospital were badly damaged,
said military officials in Jammu, the winter capital of Kashmir.
The officials cannot be identified under military briefing rules.
	   Pakistan said a total of 26 civilians _ including a 6-year-old
girl _ and four soldiers died from firing Thursday. Some 100
people, mostly civilians, were wounded.
	   India said its death toll was 22, including the dead at the
hospital. Seven security forces personnel were also wounded.
	   Police said at least 20,000 villagers living along the frontier
fled their homes to escape the shelling. Authorities were trying to
arrange temporary shelters for them.
	   The latest round of firing has been going on for four days in
India's Kupwara district, opposite Pakistan's Muzzafarabad region,
said an Indian spokesman.
	   Exchanges of mortar and gun fire is almost a daily occurrence,
but casualties of this magnitude are rare. Last September, at least
39 people died in a similar outbreak of border tension.
	   The Himalayan region, wracked by three wars since both nations
became independence 50 years ago, is divided between them by a
400-kilometer (250-mile) line of control that is monitored by the
United Nations.
	   The firing coincided with a regional summit in Colombo, Sri
Lanka, where the Indian and Pakistani prime ministers met for the
first time since the two countries conducted nuclear tests in May.
	   After agreeing in an initial meeting Wednesday to revive a
dialogue on Kashmir and other issues, talks failed between the
senior bureaucrats to find an agreed procedure for conducting the
negotiations. It was the same issue that scuttled the talks last
year.

Liverpool wants to insure star for 60 million pounds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ Liverpool wants to insure teen-age
England star Michael Owen for 60 million pounds (dlrs 100 million)
in case the 18-year-old striker's career is halted by injury.
	   Owen, the biggest young star to emerge from British soccer since
George Best in the 1960s, was a standout performer at the World
Cup, scoring one of the best goals of the championship and
attracting attention from the biggest clubs of Europe.
	   Liverpool, striving to regain a domestic league title for the
first time in nine seasons, has no intention of letting Owen go
and, in case he suffers a career-threatening injury or illness, is
looking for a company which will insure him for 60 million pounds.
	   That figure, which takes into account his transfer value and
what the club earns in sales of shirts and souvenirs, would top the
reported 50 million pound (dlrs 82.5 million) insurance cover Inter
Milan has placed on Brazilian star Ronaldo.
	   Owen, who was mobbed by hundreds of fans when Liverpool traveled
to Dublin Thursday for a series of warmup games, says that all the
attention is getting to him.
	   ``I must admit that I am already getting fed up with it all, but
it's the price you have to pay for the position you are in,'' he
said. ``People want to know about me as they do all top footballers
and it's something I have got to live with.
	   ``I know it will be like this now for probably the next 10
years, maybe longer. It's going to be like this for the rest of my
career and there's nothing I can do about it.''

IMF, ADB to review Pakistan's power utility restructuring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan will hold talks with the
International Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank for a
dlrs 250 million loan for the restructuring of its state utility
next week, a Cabinet minister said Friday.
	   A visit by lenders has been expected since June 21, when the
United States lifted a blockade on international loans to Pakistan.
Loans had been frozen under anti-unclear sanctions after Pakistan
tested nuclear weapons in May.
	   Several other issues will be discussed in the meetings with
teams from the IMF and the ADB scheduled for Tuesday, Raja Nadir
Pervaiz, federal minister for water and power told reporters. He
did not elaborate.

Ex-leprosy patients sue government for its 90-year isolation policy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Thirteen former leprosy patients sued the
government for 1.49 billion yen (dlrs 10.49 million) on Friday,
claiming Japan violated their human rights by forcing them into
isolation.
	   The lawsuit, filed earlier Friday at the Kumamoto District Court
in southern Japan, is the first by a group of former leprosy
patients demanding government compensation.
	   The plaintiffs, from two colonies on the southern island of
Kyushu, claimed Japan's policy of forced isolation, in place until
two years ago, violated their Constitutional rights to seek freedom
and happiness, Kyodo News reported.
	   They said the policy continued for decades despite global
understanding from the late 1940s that the disease was curable.
	   ``Because of the isolation policy, I lost my family, my hometown
and my life, everything,'' said Isao Tateyama, 49, in a news
conference after submitting documents at the court.
	   ``I believe all of us are entitled to be happy to make up for
the amount of tears we've shed.''
	   Tateyama was sent to the Hoshizuka Keiai-en colony in Kagoshima
Prefecture (state) when he was 13, and has lived there since.
	   ``I could have lived a completely different life without the
leprosy protection law or prejudice,'' said another plaintiff
Masaru Saito, 63.
	   Most of the other plaintiffs wanted to remain anonymous because
of bitter social stigma that they have continued to face
	   In 1996, Japan ended its 90-year-old policy of isolating
sufferers of Hansen's Disease, known as leprosy, and apologized for
its belated action to bring them back into society.
	   Although medically groundless, the policy had called for
forcible isolation of leprosy patients in remote colonies.
	   Japan's 1948 eugenics law had allowed forced sterilization of
leprosy patients.
	   While the disease is contagious, it is caused by an extremely
delicate bacteria that rarely spreads in person-to-person contact.
	   Even after they were legally freed, most patients remained in
seclusion because of persistent prejudice that makes it almost
impossible for them to get a job and support themselves.
	   There are 15 leprosy colonies in Japan that house some 5,000
patients. Since the 1960s, most new cases have been treated as
outpatients.
	   ``We believe the government has taken measures in a sincere
manner, and we are a bit surprised by the lawsuit,'' Hiroki
Nakatani, a Health and Welfare Ministry official in charge of
leprosy issues, was quoted as saying by Kyodo.
	   He said the government thought that what former leprosy patients
wanted was government support for their medical costs and welfare
projects, not compensation to individuals.

US envoy voices concern over nuclear weapons use
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ The United States is concerned that India
or Pakistan may set off nuclear weapons by mistake because they
lack adequate command and control systems, U.S. ambassador to India
Richard Celeste said Friday.
	   ``Our concern is less that India and Pakistan will use nuclear
weapons in a war and more that nuclear weapons could be used by
accident or miscalculation,'' Celeste told reporters.
	   ``The cost of managing nuclear weapons safely is very high. ...
Hundreds of safeguards need to be in place. We don't want a
miscalculation to happen in India or Pakistan.''
	   India's nuclear tests in May, followed by Pakistan's own tests,
raised fears of a nuclear conflagration in the sub-continent. The
two rivals have fought three wars since independence from British
rule 50 years ago.
	   Celeste said U.S. economic sanctions imposed on India following
the tests would affect projects dependent on U.S. government
agencies like the Exim Bank. But private U.S. investments would not
decline drastically.
	   ``Sanctions are American government policy. But American
business has its own priorities to find opportunities and to invest
in India,'' Celeste said.
	   In meetings with business and government leaders in Bombay,
Celeste described the post-nuclear test period as a ``difficult
time in Indo-U.S. relations.''

Romanian foreign minister calls for end of bloodshed in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) - Romania's foreign minister said Friday
that negotiations to solve the Kosovo conflict should begin
immediately even if the bloodshed is continuing.
	   ``Starting the negotiations as soon is possible is essential,''
the minister, Andrei Plesu, told reporters during his one-day
visit. ``It will save a lot of human lives.''
	   Plesu, who met with Albanian President Rexhep Meidani and Prime
Minister Fatos Nano, said ``it seems very important'' that the
Kosovo Liberation Army have a role in future talks with Yugoslavia
over the future of Kosovo, a province of Serbia _ the main republic
of the Yugoslav federation.
	   ``Its existence is a reality that can't be denied. Its message
should be taken in consideration during the negotiations,'' Plesu
said.
	   Hundreds of people have died in Kosovo and tens of thousands of
others have fled their homes since long-standing tensions erupted
into violent clashes five months ago, following a crackdown by
Serb-led security forces on Kosovo Albanian separatists.
	   Romania supports broad autonomy for Kosovo according to a
formula to be negotiated by the Albanian and Serb parties.

Former diplomat Sir David Hunt dies at 84

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sir David Hunt, a former private secretary to
Prime Ministers Winston Churchill and Clement Attlee and a former
ambassador to Brazil, died Thursday at the age of 84, his family
said.
	   Sir David died in a hospital but the family did not announce a
cause of death.
	   Educated at Oxford University, where he achieved a top class
degree in classics, Hunt served in the army in World War II as an
intelligence officer.
	   After joining the diplomatic service in 1947, he went on to
serve as private secretary to Attlee and Churchill.
	   In 1960 he accompanied Prime Minister Harold Macmillan on an
African tour and claimed a hand in writing the famous speech in
which Macmillan told the South African parliament he had seen the
strength of African national consciousness.
	   ``The wind of change is blowing through this continent. ... We
must all accept it as a fact, and our national policies must take
account of it,'' Macmillan told the parliament the year before the
country embarked on its apartheid policy of racial separation.
	   Hunt served as a diplomat in Uganda, Cyprus and Nigeria, and was
made ambassador to Brazil between 1969 and 1973.
	   In 1963 he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II.
	   He published many scholarly works, including books and articles
on art history and an autobiography in 1975.
	   Hunt moved from quietly working behind the scenes to fame on the
small screen when he became champion of the high-brow television
brain-game show ``Mastermind'' in 1977, with the specialist subject
the Roman Revolution.
	   Five years later he was crowned ``Mastermind of Masterminds''
when he defeated all the winners from the previous 10 years. His
specialist subject was Alexander the Great.
	   After that victory he said completing The Times crossword on the
train to London from his home in West Sussex, usually took him less
than 10 minutes, although his record was six.
	   Married twice, Hunt had two sons and four grandchildren. His
wife Iro also survives.
	   A memorial service in London is planned for later in the year.

Romanians suspected of breaking UN embargo to Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CONSTANTA, Romania (AP) _ Three Romanians were arrested for
allegedly supplying an American company with a ship which tried to
break the U.N. embargo against Iraq, police said Friday.
	   Calin Marinescu, general manager of a shipping agent company,
leased a state-owned vessel to Greek shippers in January. They in
turn leased it to an American-registered company, identified as
Tafeul Foods Impex.
	   Marinescu and two Romanians, one of whom was on the ``Opal''
when it sailed to the Gulf, were taken into custody late Thursday.
	   Police have asked prosecutors to issue a 30-day detention order
pending further investigations, which could lead to an indictment
and trial.
	   The ship was apprehended in the Gulf in January by the
American-led, multinational naval force which patrols the area to
enforce the embargo.
	   Its cargo of Iraqi oil was confiscated and the ship released. It
is currently moored in Kuwait.
	   The U.N. Security Council imposed a trade embargo on Iraq in
1990 after President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, triggering the
Gulf War.
	   After U.S.-led troops drove the Iraqis from Kuwait, the council
decided to maintain the embargo until it was satisfied that Iraq
had destroyed all weapons of mass destruction.

Yeltsin phones new Japanese prime minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Japanese account of conversation. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin telephoned Japan's
new Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on Friday to congratulate him on
his election and call for continued cooperation between their two
countries.
	   Yeltsin expressed satisfaction with Russian-Japanese relations,
which he said were becoming increasingly neighborly.
	   The two countries have yet to sign a peace treaty formally
ending World War II, largely because of a territorial dispute over
the southern Kuril Islands, which Soviet troops seized at the end
of the war.
	   Yeltsin also invited Obuchi to visit Russia in November, the
presidential press service said.
	   In Tokyo, Japan's Foreign Ministry said Obuchi expressed hopes
that his visit to Russia and Yeltsin's expected visit to Japan next
year would proceed as planned.
	   ``I'll do my best for further progress in Japanese-Russian
relations,'' a Foreign Ministry spokesman quoted Obuchi as telling
Yeltsin.
	   Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura said in an interview with Kyodo
news that he wants to visit Russia in September to pave the way for
Obuchi's visit.

Gonzalez says dirty war conviction of minister radically unjust
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quotes, background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Ex-premier Felipe Gonzalez described as
radically unjust a Supreme Court verdict which found a former
minister of his guilty of dirty war activities and alleged Friday
that the court had been under pressure from the current
conservative government.
	   In his first public reaction to Wednesday's verdict, he told the
Spanish news agency Europa Press in an interview that he would
support convicted former Interior Minister Jose Luis Barrionuevo
and his former deputy Rafael Vera until the end.
	   Asked if he thought the conservative government of Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar had pressured the court, the 56-year-old
Gonzalez said: ``It's not that I believe it. It's obvious.
	   ``I think the court declarations of deputy prime minister
(Francisco Alvarez Cascos) are clearer than anything I can say. He
let himself to condemn with his testimony,'' Gonzalez told Europa
Press.
	   Barrionuevo and Vera were both sentenced to 10 years in jail on
being found guilty along with 10 others of the 1983 kidnapping of a
French businessman who had been mistaken for a hitman from the
Basque separatist group ETA.
	   Of the 12 defendants, only Barrionuevo and Vera had pleaded
innocent.
	   The abduction was the first action attributed to the so-called
GAL death squad that killed 27 people between 1983 and 1987 in its
pursuit of ETA members and sympathizers. Many of its victims turned
out to be mistaken targets.
	   Gonzalez, one of Spain's most popular and respected politicians
ever, has long denied allegations that his 1982-96 governments set
up and ran the GAL death squads.
	   The scandal and other controversies contributed greatly to his
Socialist party's defeat in elections in 1996 after nearly 14 years
in office.
	   As a witness during the 22-day trial which ended July 14,
Gonzalez denied his governments had anything to do with the dirty
war. He has long contended that the affair is part of a plot
orchestrated by members and supporters of Aznar's government to
discredit him.
	   ``Why did they do it?'' Gonzalez asked rhetorically during the
interview. ``Because they believed that was the only way open for
them to win.
	   ``Their policies are based on destruction and elimination of the
adversary, '' he added.
	   He said that Aznar's comments earlier this year that the GAL
trial was only the start ``was a threat I believe they are willing
to carry out.''
	   Gonzalez accused Aznar's Popular Party government of ``breaking
the democratic process'' established during the transition to
democracy following near 40 years of dictatorship under Gen.
Francisco Franco.
	   His comments indicated he had no intention of heeding demands
from some opponents to retire following the verdict.
	   Urging his Socialist party not fall into the trap of seeking
revenge he said: `` We have to win by offering a project for the
country and try to avert the social and territorial disintegration
which people with few scruples and little respect for the rules are
bringing about,'' he said.

Bank Negara lowers its three-month commercial bank rate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Bank Negara Malaysia announced it
will cut a benchmark lending rate from Monday to offset an economic
slump.
	   The bank will lower its rate for three-month loans to commercial
banks to 10.5 percent from 11 percent, it said in a statement
Friday.
	   The rate is the basis for Malaysia's interbank lending rates.
	   Bank Negara said it was reducing the rate to offset a downturn
in the domestic economy.
	   The move confirmed widespread expectations that the country's
policy-makers would assume an easier monetary stance.
	   Bank Negara said the current economic situation indicates that
lowering interest rates would not pose any inflationary or currency
depreciation risks.
	   The bank also said that there is little wage pressure and that
the collapse in the stock and property markets have ``eliminated
the inflationary potential of the asset markets.''
	   It also said that the fall in global petroleum prices has
reduced inflationary pressures.
	   Referring to the ringgit, which has lost around 40 percent of
its value against the dollar, in the past year, Bank Negara said
foreign reserves remained at around dlrs 20 billion.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The bodies of 14 slain men were found
in July floating down a river in the Indonesian island of Sumatra,
a human rights group said Friday.
	   Villagers discovered the bodies of the unidentified men in Way
Umpu River near Lampung, 300 kilometers (185 miles) northwest of
the capital, Jakarta.
	   Munir, head of the Commission for Disappeared People and Victims
of Violence, said the men had been stabbed.
	   A motive for the killings was not immediately known.
	   The area around Lampung has been politically volatile at times.
In the late 1980s, soldiers killed dozens of villagers suspected of
involvement in an anti-government Islamic movement.

<TEXT>
	   DRESDEN, Germany (AP) _ A Czech man who escaped after crashing a
van full of Kosovo Albanian refugees into a wall, killing seven,
has been arrested, police said Friday.
	   The 18-year-old from Most in northern Bohemia, identified as
Marek H., confessed to having been the driver after police picked
him up near the Czech border Thursday night, hours after the
accident.
	   He was charged Friday with various crimes including negligent
homicide and smuggling illegal aliens into Germany.
	   German border guards say he ran a roadblock early Thursday then
crashed into a stone wall while speeding around a curve. Six
refugees were killed in the crush and another died later in a
hospital. Twenty others were injured, some critically.
	   Another Czech man in the van was also injured; he was arrested
at the scene.
	   Police say identification of the Kosovo Albanians has been
difficult because only one was carrying papers.
	   But they said the smuggling operation was apparently well
organized, because after the crash calls came in to police from
around Germany and Norway asking by name about people who were
supposed to be on the van.

Havel's recovery continues according to plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech President Vaclav Havel is
recovering according to plan five days after abdominal surgery to
restore his digestive tract, officials said Friday.
	   ``The course (of recovery) corresponds with expectations usual
after surgery of this nature,'' a statement from Havel's medical
team said.
	   In April, the 61-year-old president was rushed to a hospital in
Innsbruck, Austria from a nearby Alpine resort where he was
vacationing after doctors diagnosed a ruptured colon and acute
peritonitis.
	   An excretory duct was inserted during the surgery in Innsbruck.
The follow-up operation in Prague was designed to remove the duct
and reconnect Havel's large intestine to the rest of the digestive
tract.
	   In both cases, Havel's recovery was slowed down by breathing
problems and infections caused by impaired immunity.
	   The president, long a chain-smoker, has been hospitalized five
times since December 1996, when he had a third of his right lung
and a tumor removed.
	   According to the official report Friday, Havel is still on
respirator and is being fed intravenously.
	   On Thursday, doctors reported a brief case of blood infection
caused by intravenous feeding, but the incident was played down by
doctors as common in early stages of recovery.
	   ''Once the president survives the seventh day (after surgery)
the danger of complications will minimized,'' Zdenek Zadak, member
of the medical team said.
	   Doctors declined to predict when Havel would be fit enough to
resume his duties, but he is expected to stay out of political life
for the rest of the summer.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ An angry mob beat nine suspected
thieves to death after discovering one trying to steal a
motorcycle, a report said Friday.
	   The nine were killed early Friday by residents in the village of
Gading Watu in Gresik, about 650 kilometers (464 miles) east of
Jakarta, the official Antara news service reported.
	   The incident occurred after one of the nine was caught trying to
run away with a motorbike, Antara quoted witnesses as saying.
	   After beating him to death, the mob stopped a car with eight
youths that they suspected were with the first man.
	   They forced the eight out and beat them to death before burning
the car, Antara said.

Blsany to become the smallest European top division stronghold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAN SLIVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BLSANY, Czech Republic (AP) - Fifteen years ago, it was just a
casual village squad struggling at the bottom of the lowest Czech
soccer league. Now, FK Chmel Blsany enters history.
	   When the Czech soccer Extraleague, the equivalent of the English
Premier League, Italy's Serie A or the German Bundesliga, kicks off
Sunday, Blsany, a tiny village of 380 in the heart of a wealthy hop
region northwest of Prague, will become the smallest place in
Europe to be represented by a top flight soccer team.
	   ``We aspire at an entry in the Guinness Book of Records,'' said
team official Josef Vejmelka.
	   When arriving at Blsany, it's impossible to miss the huge soccer
complex. The club has five grassy fields and a smart stadium with a
capacity of 4,600 _ 12 times the village population. Two more
playing areas and a hotel are under construction.
	   ``It shouldn't really matter whether a club is based in a city
or in the country,'' says Blsany's financial manager, Zdenek Kovar.
``Soccer goes hand in hand with the economic situation of the
country. We've always worked hard and never overpaid our players,
and look how far we've got.''
	   Blsany's steady climb began in mid-1980s, when the provincial
club signed several aging stars and one of the country's most
experienced coaches, Frantisek Plass.
	   Sponsored by a prosperous hop company, the club anchored in the
second division in 1993 under the lead of another experienced
coach, Frantisek Cipro.
	   The same year, the club's former goalkeeper, Frantisek
Chvalovsky, was elected chairman of the Czech Soccer Federation
(CMFS).
	   ``He had been with us for some 20 years, always the spirit of
the team,'' recalls Kovar, a former player himself.
	   Although Chvalovsky, who was also elected the Czech
representative in UEFA's executive committee, hasn't retained any
function with the club, he remains a Blsany supporter.
	   Blsany is, however, not the first hamlet to make it to the top
Czech soccer division. Drnovice, a village of 2,000, advanced five
years ago and, backed by a petrochemical giant, almost qualified
for European competition a year later.
	   Blsany's aim for the next season is to stay in the top division.
And, with former Czech internationals Guenther Bittengel, Petr
Vrabec and Roman Hogen, it shouldn't be an unattainable wish.
	   ``The basis of our success is a good team spirit,'' Kovar says.
``We don't even think about relegation.''

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Eleven convicts escaped from a remote prison in
Russia's Far East on Friday after killing a police officer and
stealing a large number of weapons, a news agency said.
	   By the end of the day, four of the escapees were captured and
one was killed, the Interfax news agency said, citing a
high-ranking police official in the region. A police officer
involved in the chase was wounded, said Gen.-Maj. Igor Zubov,
according to Interfax.
	   The news agency said that the prisoners killed a police officer
and stole 23 assault rifles, 32 handguns, five shotguns, a machine
gun, hand grenades, ammunition and bullet-proof vests during their
escape from a prison on the peninsula near the Bering Sea.
	   They fled in two stolen trucks and an armored vehicle, and then
broke into a store and stole alcohol and food, it said.
	   With the help of armored vehicles and three helicopters, law
enforcement officials corralled the fugitives, six of whom are
soldiers suspected of murder, according to Interfax.
	   But when the police called from helicopters for the escapees to
give themselves up, the convicts opened fire with rifles, Interfax
said.
	   Police said they had the advantage in the stand-off on the
Chukotka Peninsula because it is so far north that the sun would
not go down far enough to provide adequate darkness for the
prisoners to escape.

Nigerian tests positive at World Championship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Nigerian center Julius Nwosu has tested
positive for the banned substance ephedrine, international
basketball federation officials said Friday.
	   It was the first positive drug test of the two-week World
Basketball Championship. FIBA declined to specify what action it
would take against Nwosu.
	   The 27-year-old Nigerian tested positive after Nigeria's game
against Spain on Wednesday, the opening day of the tournament.
	   Ephedrine is classed as a stimulant and is typically found in
cold medications. Its use normally carries a warning or a ban of
three months.

Police offer dlrs 5,000 reward to find killers of American woman
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HENRY WASSWA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Police are offering a dlrs 5,000 award
for information about the killers of a Minneapolis woman stabbed to
death in her hotel room in the capital, a police spokesman said
Friday.
	   Bob Ngobi said police have yet to arrest any suspects for the
killing of Maria Cecilia Goetz, a 35-year-old Minneapolis woman who
was found lying in a pool of blood in her room at the Hotel
Equatoria in downtown Kampala Tuesday night.
	   He said police were offering 5 million Uganda shillings (dlrs
5,000) for anyone with information leading to the killers.
	   Goetz, who was a programmer for East Africa Minnesota
Information Health Volunteers, had been staying in the hotel room
where she was killed since July 26.
	   Her body bore deep knife wounds on the lower left abdomen and on
the left side of the mouth.
	   The government-owned New Vision newspaper Friday cited a police
investigator saying that the killers had apparently attacked Goetz
with the toilet seat cover that was found broken to pieces.
	   Ngobi said police were investigating several suspects in the
killing.
	   He said a laptop computer belonging to Goetz was missing from
the room, but police had not yet determined whether any money was
stolen.
	   It was not clear whether anyone was waiting for Goetz in her
room when she arrived back from a meal with friends or whether they
came later.
	   No one at the hotel would speak to reporters, and the management
referred all questions to the police.
	   Kampala is not known for violent crime, although since the
beginning of the year there have been half a dozen deaths in bomb
attacks on Kampala bars and restaurants that police attributed to
rebels.
	   But earlier this month, a South Korean man and his wife and
their housekeeper were hacked to death in a case the police have
not yet solved.

U.N. committee laments Algeria's `unsatisfactory responses'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Algeria &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A U. N. committee said Friday its review of
Algeria's report on the human rights situation in the country left
it with serious concerns.
	   ``Appalled at the widespread massacres'' there, the committee
reviewing adherence to the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights said it was concerned at lack of protection of
civilians by police and military officials.
	   It urged Algeria to ensure attacks are investigated by an
independent body and, ``in all cases of massacres,'' to conduct an
independent inquiry into the conduct of security forces, punishing
them if necessary.
	   Algeria rejects claims there is a human rights crisis in the
country. It insists the killings are an internal affair and that
terrorism is the major problem.
	   Algerian Ambassador Mohamed-Salah Dembri told reporters the
committee's concerns related ``very specifically to violations
committed by the terrorist groups.''
	   The 18-member panel, chaired by French human rights expert
Christine Chanet, was worried about reports of people disappearing,
``given the unsatisfactory responses of the (Algerian) delegation
and the number of complaints from family members.''
	   It urged Algeria to set up a detailed central register of
reported disappearances.
	   The experts were also disappointed with Algeria's response to
the committee last week when queried about widespread massacres and
other atrocities, as well as information provided on
government-armed self-defense forces.
	   ``We asked specific questions on these issues but did not get
very specific answers,'' committee member Elizabeth Evatt of
Australia told a news conference.
	   Chanet said the two-day review was a ``dialogue of the deaf.''
Dembri acknowledged ``communication difficulties,'' but insisted
Algeria had given appropriate responses.
	   The Algerian government has been fighting an Islamic insurgency
for the last six years in a conflict which has left at least 75,000
people dead. A U.N. fact-finding mission is currently visiting
Algeria.
	   Some countries and international human rights groups have
suggested that the army or the self-defense forces might have had
at least a passive role in some massacres.
	   The committee's conclusions ``reflect the gravity of the human
rights situation in the country,'' Amnesty International said in a
statement.

Jan Ullrich: `Bitter and disappointed' at tour scandals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROY KAMMERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Defending champion Jan Ullrich lashed out Friday
at the doping scandals, police raids and riders' revolts which have
brought the Tour de France to the brink of collapse.
	   ``What I'm feeling I can't really describe,'' Ullrich wrote in a
column for the German daily newspaper Bild. ``I'm both unbelievably
angry and deeply disappointed. A great race has been stolen from
all of us.''
	   The Telekom rider was criticial of the Festina team, which was
kicked out of the tour after its officials and riders were
implicated in a systematic doping program.
	   Ullrich was also was angry at riders like ONCE's Laurent
Jalabert and Polti's Luc Leblanc who quit the tour in protest of
the ensuing investigation by French authorities.
	   ``Inside, I'm deeply angry,'' said Ullrich. ``At Festina, at the
justice, and also at pros like Jalabert and Luc Leblanc. They
failed at the Tour and now they're stirring up trouble
prematurely.''
	   On Wednesday, the tour riders twice stopped the stage at
Albertville, France in protest of the way French authorities
entered the hotel room where the Dutch TVM team was staying and
pulled out riders for questioning and blood tests.
	   TVM pulled out of the race Friday, leaving just 15 of the
original 21 teams in the tour.
	   The riders' strike Wednesday was particularly bitter for
Ullrich, he wrote, because he intended to mount another attack on
the holder of the yellow jersey, Marco Pantani.
	   While Ullrich is third, 5 minutes 56 seconds behind the Italian,
he mounted a stirring duel with Pantani the day before the strike
in his bid to defend his title.
	   ``That (the strike) hurt badly. I wanted to attack mercilessly
like the day before,'' Ullrich wrote.
	   ``I felt that morning I was in super form. I looked out the
window, saw it was my kind of weather, my kind of terrain and I
swore: Pantini, this is going to be another hot day for you.''
	   But Ullrich said he believes in solidarity among the riders, and
he feared repercussions from the other teams if he mounted an
attack.
	   ``I, probably also my Telekom team, would have been isolated,''
he said. ``Everybody would have ridden to make sure I don't win.''
	   Ullrich said he was available at any time for a doping test, but
was upset at the description TVM riders gave of how French
authorities stripped them naked and pulled out hair for testing
during the investigation.
	   ``When I heard that, I believed I wasn't in France, but a
totalitarian state like earlier,'' said Ullrich, raised in former
East Germany.
	   Ullrich's few words of praise were reserved for Telekom teammate
Bjarne Riis, who he believes avoided a Tour collapse at Albertville
with his adept negotiating during the race with Tour authorities.
	   Ullrich described Jalabert as the ``spokesman'' who helped
instigate the rider strike that delayed the race shortly after the
Albertville stage began.

Hakkinen fastest in free practice
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Schumacher quotes, Ferrari trying out new
chassis &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HOCKENHEIM, Germany (AP) _ Mika Hakkinen, seeking to increase
his Formula One championship lead over Michael Schumacher on
Schumacher's home circuit, set the fastest time Friday in free
practice for the German Grand Prix.
	   Hakkinen, coming off his victory at the Austrian Grand Prix five
days ago, takes an eight-point lead over Schumacher into Sunday's
race.
	   The Finn posted a time of one minute, 43.946 seconds on the
6.8-kilometer (4.2-mile) Hockenheimring in his McLaren-Mercedes.
	   ``We improved the car throughout the session and I am pleased
with the performance,'' Hakkinen said. Now we are concentrating on
setting the car up for tomorrow's qualifying but everything looks
very promising.''
	   On one of the fastest Formula One circuits, the McLarens are
believed to have an advantage with their powerful Mercedes engines.
	   Hakkinen's McLaren teammate David Coulthard had the second
fastest time Friday, clocking 1:44.138.
	   ``A trouble-free first day,'' Coulthard said. ``The only
characteristic in the car which we are trying to deal with is some
oversteer, but apart from that I am looking forward to tomorrow.''
	   Although Friday's free practice, usually used for testing tires
and set-ups of the cars, may not have much relevance for the
starting grid order, it indicated that the McLarens are primed for
the battle with the Ferraris of Schumacher and Eddie Irvine.
	   McLaren and Ferrari have been locked in a close battle since the
start of the season.
	   Hakkinen has won five races, Schumacher four and Coulthard one.
Six races are left in the season.
	   No other make has won a race this year. Hakkinen has 66 points
in the drivers' standings, Schumacher 58 and Coulthard 36.
	   Schumacher, a two-time champion with other makes, is seeking to
become the first Ferrari driver to win the championship since Jody
Scheckter in 1979. Neither Hakkinen nor Coulthard have ever won the
title.
	   ``I want to put Hakkinen under pressure and I think I have a
good chance of winning my home Grand Prix,'' said Schumacher, who
was the first German to win here in 1995.
	   ``McLaren has an advantage on this track, but we are not far
behind. It's going to be exciting,'' Schumacher said.
	   Although the championship could be beyond Coulthard's reach, he
could beat Schumacher for second place.
	   Hakkinen's victory in Austria snapped Schumacher's run of three
straight wins. With Coulthard second, it also gave McLaren its
fourth 1-2 finish of the season.
	   ``The red car (Ferrari) has been a challenger all year,''
Hakkinen said Thursday. ``But the top car at the moment is McLaren.
	   Schumacher will have the wild support from 150,000 fans that jam
into Hockenheim's huge grandstand. But for McLaren, it's also
something of a home race, through its alliance with Mercedes
engines.
	   Third in Friday's practice was former champion Damon Hill of
Britain, posting a time of 1:44.294 in his Jordan-Mugen Honda.
	   Jean Alesi of France in a Sauber-Petronas was fourth in
1:44.546, followed by the two Ferraris.
	   Schumacher was fifth in 1:44.757, while his teammate Eddie
Irvine was sixth in 1:44.780.
	   Ferrari tried a long wheelbase chassis on Schumacher's car, but
team chief Jean Todt said Schumacher will return to standard
wheelbase.
	   ``Engine power is not a problem for us,'' Schumacher said. ``But
I was sliding quite a bit as I did not have a good grip.''
	   ``Hockenheim seems to be much bumpier than in previous years so
you are shaken around a lot in the cockpit,'' he said.
	   ``Qualifying will be difficult and I can't make any predictions.
This track often comes up with surprises,'' Schumacher said.
	   The starting grid will be decided in Saturday's qualifying.

Japan's financial watchdog penalizes nine banks and four brokerages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's financial watchdog punished Sanwa Bank by
banning it from mutual bond sales for one year after its employees
allegedly bribed government officials.
	   Japan's Financial Supervisory Agency said it also imposed
less-severe penalties on eight other major banks and four
brokerages whose employees allegedly wined, dined and gave gifts to
government officials who were supervising them.
	   The agency said, however, that the bribes did not violate any
laws.
	   It was the first major action taken by the agency in its effort
to crack down on widespread corruption in Japan's financial
industry. The agency was set up in June, taking over the role of
supervising the industry from the Finance Ministry.
	   The agency suspended Sanwa from mutual fund sales at its
branches for one year, effective Aug. 3. During the period, the
bank is also prohibited from taking advantage of recent
deregulation to establish a holding company structure for its
operations.
	   Sanwa has said it is studying a plan to create a holding
company, although it has not announced the timing.
	   Earlier this year, a Sanwa employee allegedly bribed central
bank officials to obtain information about government inspections
of other banks, as well as information about the central bank's
target range for for short-term interest rates, the agency said.
	   A Bank of Japan official and several Finance Ministry officials
were arrested earlier this year for allegedly accepting bribes.
	   The string of bribery scandals involving Finance Ministry and
central bank officials tarnished the image of Japan's bureaucrats,
forcing the government to enact a new law to tighten ethics.
	   The other banks and brokerages named by the agency were given
strong warnings, in the form of administrative orders to improve
their management.
	   Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd., Asahi
Bank Ltd., Sumitomo Bank Ltd. and Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd.
were required to report their progress in complying with the orders
to the agency every six months.
	   The other institutions involved are Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan Ltd., Fuji Bank Ltd., Sakura Bank Ltd., Nomura Securities
Co., Nikko Securities Co., Daiwa Securities Co., and Sakura
Securities Co.
	   Employees of the banks and brokerages were variously found by
the watchdog agency to have treated officials of the Finance
Ministry officials, the Bank of Japan and the state-affiliated
Japan Highway Public Corp. with lavish dinners and other
entertainment.

Report: Deutsche Bank ``could have'' known they profited from
</HEADLINE>
Jewish victims' gold &QL; 
 &UR; By IAN MADER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ A team of historians commissioned by
Deutsche Bank to trace the origin of gold bars it traded during the
Nazi era confirmed Friday that the bank had profited from gold
taken from Holocaust victims.
	   The historians were unable to determine with certainty whether
bank executives knew that some of the gold purchased from the
Reichsbank, the Nazi central bank, had been taken directly from
Nazi victims.
	   However, they said it is ``likely'' that Deutsche Bank officials
were aware of the origins of some of the gold.
	   ``Gold played a deciding roll in financing the import of
strategic goods essential to the Nazi war efforts,'' the report
said.
	   ``The vast majority of the gold that Germany sold was stolen:
from central banks of vanquished countries, but also from
individuals, especially the victims of the Nazis' racist
persecution _ above all Jews.''
	   Given their connections and information available at the time,
bank officials ``could have known that the gold originally belonged
_ and ... still belongs _ to victims of Nazi Germany,'' the report
concluded.
	   German television reported in December that the bank had bought
Reichsbank gold robbed from Jews.
	   Deutsche Bank said at that time it was unaware of the trading
and announced it had commissioned five historians from Israel,
Germany, the United States and Britain to research the origin of
gold it bought during World War II.
	   Separately, Deutsche Bank was named in a lawsuit filed June 3 in
New York on behalf of 10,000 Holocaust survivors and victims'
relatives. That lawsuit, still pending, alleges Deutsche Bank and
Dresdner Bank had profited from the looting of gold and other
personal property from Jewish victims of the Holocaust.
	   Dresdner Bank has commissioned a similar review.
	   Deutsche Bank's historians conducted their research using the
bank's own microfilm records, the books of the defunct Reichsbank
and files from Degussa, which smelted the gold.
	   Their report concludes that Deutsche Bank purchased 4,446
kilograms (4.9 tons) from the Nazi central bank during World War
II, and that at least 744 kilograms (1,637 pounds) of it stemmed
from Holocaust victims.
	   Trading gold through its only overseas subsidiary, in Istanbul,
Turkey, the bank made a profit from 1941-43 of dlrs 378,000, or
dlrs 3.4 million today. The historians said the profit represented
0.15 percent of the bank's total profits during that period.
	   Some gold, 710 pounds, remained among assets frozen into the
1950s in Switzerland at the request of the Allies after the war,
the report said.
	   The gold was sold in 1995. This March, the bank donated the
entire dlrs 3.1 million in proceeds to Jewish groups, saying it
suspected the gold may originally have been robbed from Jews.

 &UR; British police raid sex shop, confiscate black-market Viagra &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Agents raided a London sex shop and confiscated 14
black-market boxes of Viagra, the new anti-impotence drug that is
wildly popular in the United States but remains an unlicensed
``banned substance'' in Britain.
	   The seized medication, 60 pills in all, was removed from a store
in the city's Soho section after an official came across the Viagra
during a routine check of the neighborhood's sex shops, authorities
said Friday.
	   Fourteen boxes containing a total of 60 pills were taken from
the store in a joint operation between government regulatory
agencies and police.

Cambodian opposition party complains of systematic flaw in
</HEADLINE>
vote-counting &QL;

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian opposition parties on
Friday continued their protests over the country's parliamentary
election, and repeated their vow not to accept the results until
their complaints of cheating had been thoroughly investigated.
	   The FUNCINPEC party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh and the Sam
Rainsy Party issued a joint statement saying they would accept the
results of Sunday's poll ``when and if the serious irregularities
reported'' were shown not to have altered its outcome.
	   The Sam Rainsy Party also delivered an official complaint to the
government's National Election Committee charging that there was
possible systematic cheating in the vote-counting process.
	   The complaint alleged that the monitoring system was flawed
because ballots were counted simultaneously at many tables at
counting stations, while only one observer from each party was
allowed to be present for the whole station. They could not
effectively monitor counting at several tables _ sometimes more
than a dozen _ at the same time, it said.
	   The complaint asked that ballots be recounted, or if they were
not properly secured after the counting, that voting be repeated at
stations where the questionable ballots originated.
	   Opposition parties on Tuesday had already asked that new votes
be taken in disputed precincts if their charges of wrongdoing were
found to be valid.
	   They also threatened to boycott the National Assembly if their
complaints were not heeded, bringing the prospect that Cambodia
will remain in a state of political turmoil.
	   The opposition parties anticipate that official election results
will favor the ruling party of strongman Hun Sen. It has been
projected that Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party will get 59-64 of
a total of 122 parliamentary seats, while FUNCINPEC will get 43-45
and the Sam Rainsy Party 15-18.
	   Preliminary final results of the election are expected to be
announced by the election committee Saturday or Sunday. Complete
official results have been released so far from just 16 of the
country's 23 provincial constituencies.
	   More detailed allegations of election fraud are continuing to
emerge, particularly from opposition party activists who have made
their way to the capital from rural areas after being threatened by
police and local authorities loyal to the ruling Cambodian People's
Party.
	   Scores of such activists have taken shelter in the FUNCINPEC and
Sam Rainsy Party headquarters in the capital.
	   A poll watcher from COMFREL, the country's top independent
monitoring group, said he had observed questionable practices at a
counting station in Takeo province.
	   ``I want to tell what I have seen and get justice for the
people,'' he said.
	   He said the counting was done in two separate rooms, although
each party was allowed just one observer apiece, and that when the
opposition poll watchers complained, they were ignored, finally
leaving in disgust.
	   He claimed to have observed from a window ballots for the Sam
Rainsy Party being marked by counting officials, who were then able
to declare them invalid.
	   The man, who asked not to be named, said that all ballots cast
for the main opposition parties which were not perfectly marked
were invalidated, while similar ballots casting a vote for the
ruling Cambodian People's Party were accepted.
	   A spokesman for the National Election Committee asked Hun Sen's
ruling party to help the investigations of election fraud ``by
immediately ending the campaign of intimidation it has mounted
against our activists in villages and communes across Cambodia.''
	   ``The testimony of these activists, many of whom are
eyewitnesses to electoral fraud, is essential to an assessment of
the election results,'' it said.

U.S. presses Milosevic to allow aid flow into Kosovo

 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Albanian sources reporting
shelling Friday near Junik, new quotes from UNHCR, CHANGES estimate

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A U.S. envoy urged Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic on Friday to let aid workers deliver
food, medicine and blankets to tens of thousands of ethnic
Albanians who have fled into the hills of Kosovo to escape a major
government offensive.
	   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, also
said Christopher Hill would seek assurances that Milosevic has
called off the weeklong offensive in the province, as he promised a
European Union delegation Thursday.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, under ethnic Albanian control,
reported heavy shelling Friday of villages close to the Albanian
border, including Junik, a rebel stronghold where thousands of
Albanian civilians were believed to have taken refuge.
	   The report could not be immediately confirmed. Junik has been
under government siege for five days, but Milosevic told the
Europeans he would not shell the town, near the Albanian border.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
people, and many want independence from Serbia, largest of the two
republics that form Yugoslavia.
	   Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, has been spearheading
international efforts to arrange peace talks between Milosevic and
leaders of the ethnic Albanian community.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army has been resisting
international calls to unite behind moderate Albanian politician
Ibrahim Rugova, who opposes violence. But diplomats hoped Serb
gains during the offensive might make the rebels more amenable to a
negotiated settlement.
	   On Wednesday, Hill met with KLA representatives and said they
showed interest for the first time in endorsing the idea of a joint
Albanian delegation.
	   An Albanian source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The
Associated Press that the rebels asked Hill for a week to decide
whether to accept the negotiating team.
	   Meanwhile, aid workers Friday searched the rugged hills around
sites of recent fighting in hopes of locating an estimated 20,000
people _ mostly Albanians _ displaced by the Serb offensive.
	   The search for missing civilians intensified after teams from
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees found at least
500 terrified ethnic Albanians hiding Thursday in the rugged hills
near Malisevo, which the KLA abandoned two days before.
	   Maki Shinohara, a UNHCR official, said the Albanians had little
food and no water and were fearful Serb police would hunt them
down. She said the refugee agency would try to ship them food and
supplies Friday or Saturday.
	   ``They're sleeping under the trees,'' another UNHCR official,
Tom Vargas, told CNN-International. ``A large number of women,
children and elderly are among them.''
	   In Geneva, UNHCR spokesman Kris Janowski said at least 100,000
people had been displaced since Milosevic launched a crackdown on
Albanian militants in February.
	   The United States and the Europeans reject independence for
Kosovo, fearing it would lead to similar demands among
Albanian-speaking communities elsewhere in the southern Balkans.

Alleged Indonesian kidnap victim turns up in Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A man claiming to be an Indonesian
activist who was kidnapped and later released by the military has
turned up in the Philippines, according to a report Friday.
	   The man, Hendra Hendrawan, reported to the Indonesian consulate
general in Davao on Monday, the official Antara news agency quoted
Indonesian military officials as saying.
	   However, Antara cited consulate officials as saying they could
not confirm his identity because he had no personal documents.
	   Human rights activists say the whereabouts of 14 of at least 23
activists believed to have been kidnapped since last year remains
unknown. Others have been freed, telling how they were seized by
armed men and interrogated about their political activities.
	   The government opponents were abducted while former President
Suharto was still in power, and the military has admitted that
members of an elite unit known as Kopassus were involved. Eleven
have been arrested and face a military trial.
	   The authoritarian Suharto often treated his opponents harshly,
jailing many and exercising tight controls on the media.
	   There is no evidence that Suharto, who quit in May amid riots
over price increases and student protests, was behind the
kidnappings. A son-in-law of Suharto was in charge of the Kopassus
unit at the time of the abductions.
	   Hendrawan is a political science student from Airlangga State
University in Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city.
	   He was reported missing along with two other students. The two
others have since reappeared.
	   Hendrawan reportedly said he was freed later in March and fled
secretly to the Philippines for fear of persecution by Indonesian
security forces.

British police raid sex shop, confiscate black-market Viagra

	   LONDON (AP) _ Agents raided a London sex shop and confiscated 14
black-market boxes of Viagra, the new anti-impotence drug that is
wildly popular in the United States but remains an unlicensed
``banned substance'' in Britain.
	   The seized medication, 60 pills in all, was removed from a store
in the city's Soho section after an official came across the Viagra
during a routine check of the neighborhood's sex shops, authorities
said Friday.
	   Fourteen boxes containing a total of 60 pills were taken from
the store in a joint operation between government regulatory
agencies and police.
	   A 38-year-old man was questioned but not arrested and could face
charges.
	   Viagra was launched in the United States three months ago and
has been used by more than 2 million men. It has not yet received
its British license. When it does, it will probably be available
only by prescription.

U.N. committee laments Algeria's `unsatisfactory responses'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Algeria &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A U. N. committee said Friday that its review of
Algeria's report on its own human rights situation left it with
serious concerns.
	   ``Appalled at the widespread massacres,'' the committee
reviewing adherence to the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights said it was concerned by the lack of protection of
Algerian civilians by police and military officials.
	   It urged Algeria to ensure that attacks are investigated by an
independent body and, ``in all cases of massacres,'' to conduct an
independent inquiry into the conduct of security forces, punishing
them if necessary.
	   Algeria rejects claims that there is a human rights crisis in
the country. It insists the killings are an internal affair and
that terrorism is the major problem.
	   The Algerian government has been fighting an Islamic insurgency
for the last six years, a conflict which has left at least 75,000
people dead. A U.N. fact-finding mission is visiting Algeria.
	   Some countries and international human rights groups have
suggested that the army or the self-defense forces might have had
at least a passive role in some massacres.
	   Algerian Ambassador Mohamed-Salah Dembri told reporters that the
committee's concerns related ``very specifically to violations
committed by the terrorist groups.''
	   The 18-member panel, chaired by French human rights expert
Christine Chanet, was worried about reports of people disappearing,
``given the unsatisfactory responses of the (Algerian) delegation
and the number of complaints from family members.''
	   It urged Algeria to set up a detailed central register of
reported disappearances.
	   The experts were also disappointed with Algeria's response to
the committee last week when queried about widespread massacres and
other atrocities, as well as information provided on
government-armed self-defense forces.
	   ``We asked specific questions on these issues but did not get
very specific answers,'' committee member Elizabeth Evatt of
Australia said at a news conference.
	   Chanet said the two-day review was a ``dialogue of the deaf.''
Dembri acknowledged ``communication difficulties,'' but insisted
that Algeria had given appropriate responses.
	   The committee's conclusions ``reflect the gravity of the human
rights situation in the country,'' Amnesty International said in a
statement.

Pakistan expected little from prime ministers' summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-India-Pakistan-Nuclear &QL; 
 &UR; By DONNA BRYSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistanis watched closely but with
little hope as their prime minister sat down with the leader of
their longtime rival. So news Friday that talks with India had
failed met with little more than shrugs.
	   ``I was not expecting much, very frankly,'' said Zafar Iqbal
Cheema, chairman of the department of defense and strategic studies
at Islamabad's Quaid-e-Azam University. ``Once again, there's a
kind of a deadlock.''
	   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his Indian counterpart Atal
Bihari Vajpayee met on a tropical island earlier this week for
their first talks since both ordered nuclear weapons tests in May.
They said they wanted to try to normalize relations that have been
poor since their two countries gained independence from the British
in 1947, and that deteriorated even further with the nuclear tests.
	   As has happened again and again over their long history of
hostility, the talks bogged down over how to resolve competing
claims to the Himalayan territory of Kashmir. Even as they met
Thursday, their armies were trading fire along the Kashmir border,
killing a total of at least 52 people on both sides.
	   Meetings in the Sri Lankan capital of Colombo broke up Friday
with Pakistan calling India ``rigid and inflexible'' and India
retorting that Pakistan was ``neurotic.'' No new talks were
scheduled.
	   ``The situation has become more grave and more serious, and
carries more serious consequences'' because both sides are
determined to build nuclear arsenals, Cheema said. Like his prime
minister, he suggested outsiders step in to mediate. India is
firmly opposed to international interference on Kashmir.
	   The Sharif-Vajpayee talks in Sri Lanka have been front-page news
in Pakistan for days, the stories illustrated by color photographs
of the two prime ministers in similar traditional dress shaking
hands, in grave conversation, even posed together against the
Indian Ocean surf.
	   Ironically, the photographs gave the impression of two old
friends on a summer holiday.
	   The ``much-awaited meeting'' failed to ``generate any hope of a
breakthrough in the two countries' relations,'' The Muslim
newspaper said in an editorial.
	   India took much of the blame. ``Anyone hoping that the pressure
of world opinion might force Mr. Vajpayee to make some move, even
the slightest one, towards addressing the core issue of Kashmir
that has pushed Pakistan and India into a nuclear confrontation,
has been proved to be unrealistic,'' The Nation said in its
editorial.
	   ``The whole world is watching us now,'' said Kunwar Khalid
Yunas, a member of parliament from the Mohajir Qaumi Movement, a
party that is part of Sharif's governing coalition. ``If both of
the countries would sit together seriously, changes could be
far-reaching. It's what the world expects, it's what the people of
the region expect.''
	   The Pakistani government never expected much. Foreign Minister
Gohar Ayub Khan kicked off the trip by telling reporters the talks
in Sri Lanka would likely produce what Indo-Pakistani meetings
usually do: ``Nil.''

IMF mission to recommend dlrs 2.2 billion loan for Ukraine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMS. Recasts, UPDATES with IMF statement, comments from
National Bank chief. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A team from the International Monetary Fund
offered Ukraine a respite from its economic distress Friday, saying
it would recommend the release of a dlrs 2.2 billion loan for the
struggling country.
	   The loan, yet to be approved by the fund's board of directors,
would help Ukraine pay off some of its mounting foreign and
domestic debts. Ukrainian officials also voiced hope it would help
stabilize the shaky hryvna currency and attract foreign investors.
	   ``We've reached a tentative agreement with Ukrainian authorities
on the program of stabilization and restructuring of the economy,''
said the IMF mission leader, Mohammed Shadman-Valavi. He said that
the IMF would consider the team's recommendation in late August.
	   Shadman-Valavi described the three-year program as ``very
ambitious.'' It aims to reform the finance sector and reduce the
budget deficit to 3.3 percent of gross domestic product in 1998,
and to about 2 percent of GDP in the following years.
	   The plan also envisages economic growth in coming years after a
decade of decline. In addition, the inflation rate is forecast at
10 percent in 1998 and 8 percent through 1999-2001. Last year's
inflation was 12 percent.
	   The program ``should enable Ukraine to attract new credits from
other international organizations'' and ``encourage private
creditors to maintain their current exposure to Ukrainian
borrowers,'' the IMF team said in a statement.
	   ``Members of the mission have positively assessed our work and
treated our problems with understanding. They also saw our
decisiveness in implementing economic reforms,'' Deputy Prime
Minister Serhiy Tyhypko told reporters.
	   Approval of the loan is crucial for Ukraine. The chronically
cash-short country needs to repay more than dlrs 1 billion to
foreign lenders in August alone.
	   In addition, Ukraine's hryvna has been under pressure in recent
months because foreign investors have been withdrawing from the
country's financial market. The National Bank has spent some 15
percent of its reserves defending the country's currency, leaving
about dlrs 1.75 billion in its treasury.
	   National Bank chairman Viktor Yushchenko said the IMF
announcement gives the hryvna a major impetus to remain stable
until the end of 1998.
	   The government has vowed to keep the hryvna currency within the
band of 1.85 to 2.25 to the U.S. dollar in 1998. But it has been
sliding steadily, from 1.95 to the dollar in January to 2.13 by
Friday.
	   Ukrainian officials say the IMF loan, if released, would be used
primarily to replenish the National Bank's reserves.
	   The government has approved dozens of economic measures since
May, trying to meet requirements set by the IMF. Last year, the
fund refused to release a similar loan because of Ukraine's stalled
economic reforms, and it suspended aid to Kiev in the spring.

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Italian veteran cyclist Gianni Bugno, a
two-time world road champion, told the Italian television network
RAI that he will retire at the end of this season.
	   ``This is my last year on a bike. I think I have given all I had
to give,'' the 34-year-old Italian said Friday.
	   Bugno said he hoped to win a last race, the Tour of Lombardy
classic in October, before retiring for good.

Former senior Chinese leader sentenced to 16 years imprisonment

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Former Beijing party boss and mayor Chen Xitong,
once one of the most powerful men in China, was sentenced Friday to
16 years in prison, in the climax to a case that galvanized public
disgust with corruption.
	   The state-run media's announcements of the verdict, shortly
after it was handed down Friday morning, did little to clarify
Chen's role in a massive graft scandal that may have cost Beijing
as much as 18.3 billion yuan (more than dlrs 2 billion).
	   Chen's sentence underscored the ruling Communist Party's fears
that simmering anger over corruption is menacing its monopoly on
power and its recognition that with millions being laid off from
state factories, officials can ill afford to be seen living high on
the hog.
	   Before his disgrace, Chen was one of 20 members of the party's
elite Politburo, the apex of Chinese political power. He was the
highest Communist Party official to face criminal prosecution since
the notorious Gang of Four were tried for political crimes
following the calamitous 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
	   Hundreds of thousands of officials have been punished in a
five-year-old anti-corruption campaign that has seen many,
including Chen's own son, jailed or even executed.
	   Corruption has undermined public trust in many of the
institutions China needs to build its economy _ courts, public
pensions, housing among them.
	   President Jiang Zemin, who heads the party, recently intensified
the fight against graft by ordering the military to divest itself
of its wideranging business interests, which have often served as
covers for smuggling, prostitution and other illicit activities.
	   State television showed Chen, flanked by court police, standing
impassively before a line of five judges, five prosecutors and his
defending lawyer, as his verdict was read out at the Beijing
Municipal Higher People's Court. A public audience of more than 150
people was on hand to hear the verdict, according to the official
Xinhua News Agency.
	   It was Chen's first public appearance since his ouster in the
spring of 1995.
	   Xinhua said evidence showed Chen lived ``a corrupt and decadent
life'' and had built and outfitted two luxury villas, taken gifts
of gold and silver, expensive pens, watches and cameras and
squandered public money on extravagant food, drink and
entertainment.
	   Chen also was found guilty of conspiring with other officials to
embezzle public funds and of violating laws regarding the approval
of real estate projects.
	   During Chen's tenure, Beijing became a sea of construction sites
for glossy shopping malls and hotels, many of which are now having
trouble staying in business.
	   Scores of other Beijing officials have been sentenced in
connection with the scandal, including Chen's secretary, Chen Jian,
who was sentenced to 15 years, and his son, Chen Xiaotong,
sentenced to 12 years for unspecified ``economic crimes.''
	   Many Chinese had believed Chen was too powerful to prosecute,
and Chinese sources with close ties to party leaders said Chen had
threatened to implicate other leaders if prosecuted.
	   Public anger mounted, however, as details about the case leaked
out, and Chen was made the highest-profile example of official
determination to root out corruption.
	   Chen will serve 16 years for corruption and dereliction of duty,
and bribes and other public property taken by him are to be
confiscated and handed over to the State Treasury. He can appeal
the verdict in the next 10 days, Xinhua said.
	   It was unclear how far Chen's sentence would go toward assuaging
public resentment over corruption.
	   Chen, 68, ran Beijing first as mayor and then as party secretary
from 1983 until he was forced to step down after a vice mayor
committed suicide rather than face arrest for corruption.
	   Chen was stripped of his Politburo seat in September 1995,
expelled from the party last September, and handed over to
prosecutors in February.
	   A closed trial was conducted on July 20, in keeping with laws
stipulating that cases involving state secrets or individual
privacy should not be open to the public, Xinhua reported.

U.S. presses Milosevic to allow aid flow into Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Albanian sources reporting
shelling near Junik, new quotes from UNHCR, CHANGES estimate of
refugees from ``about 500'' to ``at least'' 500; No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A U.S. envoy urged Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic on Friday to let aid workers deliver
food, medicine and blankets to tens of thousands of ethnic
Albanians who have fled into the hills of Kosovo to escape a major
government offensive.
	   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, also
said that Christopher Hill would seek assurances that Milosevic has
called off the weeklong offensive in the province, as he promised a
European Union delegation Thursday.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, under ethnic Albanian control,
reported heavy shelling Friday of villages close to the Albanian
border, including Junik, a rebel stronghold where thousands of
Albanian civilians were believed to have taken refuge.
	   The report could not be immediately confirmed. Junik has been
under government siege for five days, but Milosevic told the
Europeans he would not shell the town.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
people, and many want independence from Serbia, largest of the two
republics that form Yugoslavia. But Serbs consider Kosovo the
cradle of their culture.
	   The United States and the Europeans reject independence for
Kosovo, fearing it would lead to similar demands among
Albanian-speaking communities elsewhere in the southern Balkans.
	   In Geneva, UNHCR spokesman Kris Janowski said at least 100,000
people have been displaced since Milosevic launched his crackdown
on ethnic Albanian militants in February.
	   Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, has been spearheading
international efforts to arrange peace talks between Milosevic and
leaders of the ethnic Albanian community.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army has been resisting
international calls to unite behind moderate Albanian politician
Ibrahim Rugova, who opposes violence. But diplomats hoped that Serb
gains during the offensive might make the rebels more amenable to a
negotiated settlement.
	   On Wednesday, Hill met with KLA representatives and said they
showed interest for the first time in endorsing the idea of a joint
Albanian delegation.
	   An Albanian source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The
Associated Press that the rebels asked Hill for a week to decide.
	   Meanwhile, aid workers searched the rugged hills around sites of
recent fighting in hopes of locating an estimated 20,000 people _
mostly ethnic Albanians _ displaced by the Serb offensive.
	   The search for missing civilians intensified after teams from
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees found at least
500 terrified ethnic Albanians hiding Thursday in the rugged hills
near Malisevo, which the KLA abandoned two days before.
	   Maki Shinohara, a UNHCR official, said the Albanians had little
food and no water and feared that Serb police would hunt them down.
She said the refugee agency would try to ship them food and
supplies Friday or Saturday.
	   ``They're sleeping under the trees,'' another UNHCR official,
Tom Vargas, told CNN International. ``A large number of women,
children and elderly are among them.''

Nigerian tests positive at World Championship

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Nigerian center Julius Nwosu has tested
positive for the banned substance ephedrine at the World Basketball
Championship, officials of FIBA said Friday.
	   It was the first positive drug test of the two-week tournament.
FIBA, the sport's world governing body, declined immediate comment
and would not specify what action it would take.
	   The 27-year-old tested positive after Nigeria's 80-68 loss to
Spain on Wednesday, the opening day of the championship.
	   Nwosu has had short stints in the CBA and NBA and is now with
Galatasaray in the Turkish League.
	   He was suspended indefinitely by the Connecticut Pride of the
CBA in January for conduct detrimental to the team. He also was
briefly with the NBA's San Antonio Spurs and Boston Celtics.
	   Ephedrine is classed as a stimulant and is typically found in
cold medications. Its use normally carries a warning or a ban of
three months or fewer.
	   The world of sports has been rocked in recent days by a series
of doping scandals, including in the Tour de France, track and
field and swimming.

Carp beat Dragons 8-6

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Hiroshima Toyo Carp rapped out 13 hits Friday
to beat the Central League's second-place Chunichi Dragons 8-6 at
home and halt a nine-game losing streak.
	   Timoniel Perez, a Dominican who was formerly with the Carp
Academy, hit a three-run homer in the bottom of the first inning,
his 3rd of the year.
	   The Carp batted in three more runs in the second on consecutive
singles by Tomoaki Kanemoto and Itsuki Asai for a comfortable 8-0
lead.
	   At Koshien, Yasuaki Taiho blasted two homers as the Hanshin
Tigers beat archrival Yomiuri Giants 6-1 at home, extending their
winning streak to four.
	   Taiho hit a solo homer in the bottom of the third inning, then
slammed a three-run homer into the right stands in the seventh.
	   Dave Hansen, formerly of the Chicago Cubs, drove in a run on a
single in the first.
	   In Pacific League action, Ichiro Suzuki went 5-for-5 and batted
in a total of two runs as the Orix BlueWave beat the second-place
Kintetsu Buffaloes 7-3 at Osaka Dome.
	   Phil Clark hit a solo homer and Tuffy Rhodes blasted out a two
run homer for the Buffaloes but the team could not add more runs.
Both Clark and Rhodes are former Boston Red Sox players.
	   At Fukuoka, Domingo Martinez, formerly with Triple-A Rochester,
and Norio Tanabe drove in two runs with back-to-back singles,
giving the Seibu Lions a 3-1 victory over the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks.

	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
filed a million-rupee (million-dollar) defamation suit against
Pakistan's top corruption investigator, saying he was making it
impossible for her to get a fair trial.
	   In her court papers, Ms. Bhutto accused Saifur Rehman, head of
the Accountability Commission, of defaming her in comments to
journalists. She sought 20 million rupees (about dlrs 350,000) for
mental anguish and another 70 million rupees (about dlrs 1.25
million) for damage to her reputation.
	   ``The atmosphere has been poisoned. In this atmosphere no fair
trial is possible,'' Ms. Bhutto said as she left the provincial
high court in Karachi. ``The future of my political life, my
liberty, the future of my political party _ Everything is at
stake.''
	   Rehman told The Associated Press that his statements to the
media have been factual responses to the public's legitimate
interest in his work.
	   His investigation, he said, ``is not politically motivated. It's
totally legal. We have collected evidence and acted on that
evidence.''

Tens of thousands of women rally for peace

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Tens of thousands of Ethiopian
women rallied Friday for a peaceful end to the three-month border
conflict with Eritrea, bearing signs saying that women and children
are the victims of war.
	   In towns throughout the country, women staged demonstrations
urging both he Ethiopian and Eritrean governments to end the border
dispute that erupted in brief but deadly clashes and air strikes in
late May and early June.
	   Hundreds were reported killed and thousands displaced by the
conflict, and both countries have massed troops along their common
border.
	   In the capital, approximately 100,000 women converged on central
Meskel (Holy Cross) Square, calling on their ``Eritrean sisters''
to put pressure their own government to accept proposals for peace
put forth by the U.S. and Rwanda and backed by the Organization of
African Unity.
	   Eritrea has steadfastly rejected the point in the U.S.-Rwanda
proposal that calls on its troops to withdraw to positions held
before May 6.
	   Under OAU auspices, Burkina Faso, Djibouti and Zimbabwe have
been investigating the causes of the conflict and are expected to
present their findings to an OAU committee in the Burkinabe capital
Ouagadougou Saturday and Sunday.
	   Eritrea denied reports that there would be direct contact
between representatives of Eritrea and Ethiopia at the OAU meeting.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Health inspectors demanded the government
act to end a 3-month-old homeless protest inside Warsaw's main
railway station Friday, saying the dozens of people living there
could start an epidemic.
	   ``Nobody realizes that an epidemic bomb in the center of Warsaw
can explode any time,'' said rail health inspector Jolanta
Szewczyk.
	   Homeless from all over Poland have occupied the main hall of
Warsaw's central station for the last three months to demand land
for building a proper shelter.
	   Szewczyk said dozens of them sleep at the station and some
200-300 turn up to have a meal distributed by Carmelite nuns. She
said she was worried that some were infected with tuberculosis,
AIDS and jaundice and could spread the diseases.
	   But homeless say the central station is the best location for
their protest.
	   ``Many people see us here and the authorities must do
something,'' said Wojciech Trzcinski, 45, who left prison in
January and found his wife living with another man in their former
apartment.
	   Warsaw has about 800 beds in four shelters but Trzcinski says
homeless want to have ``a real home, not left-luggage office.''
	   The government agricultural agency promised to sell to the
Carmelites two hectares (five acres) in Brwinow, outside of Warsaw,
to be paid for over 10 years. The agreement is to be signed next
week and the homeless are to leave the station by Aug. 15.
	   But Brwinow residents have already announced they will protest
against building a shelter for homeless in their neighborhood.

Two arrested on charges of causing major forest fire in Spain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Police have arrested two men accused of
starting a five-day day forest fire in northeastern Spain last week
that destroyed some 27,000 hectares (67,000 acres) of forest and
scrubland, a government spokeswoman said Friday.
	   The two men, whose names were not released, are also suspected
of causing other forest fires in the Barcelona area over the past
few days, said the Interior Ministry spokeswoman.
	   The fire, which was extinguished July 22, was the worst to hit
the region of Catalonia since 1994.
	   Recent summer temperatures of over 38 degrees Celsius (100
Fahrenheit) aided the blaze's rapid spread across an area 100
kilometers (62 miles) northwest of Barcelona.
	   Fires destroy thousands of hectares (acres) of forest land each
year in Spain.

shelling Friday near Junik, new quotes from UNHCR, CHANGES estimate

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A U.S. envoy urged Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic on Friday to let aid workers deliver
food, medicine and blankets to tens of thousands of ethnic
Albanians who have fled into the hills of Kosovo to escape a major
government offensive.
	   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, also
said Christopher Hill would seek assurances that Milosevic has
called off the weeklong offensive in the province, as he promised a
European Union delegation Thursday.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, under ethnic Albanian control,
reported heavy shelling Friday of villages close to the Albanian
border, including Junik, a rebel stronghold where thousands of
Albanian civilians were believed to have taken refuge.
	   The report could not be immediately confirmed. Junik has been
under government siege for five days, but Milosevic told the
Europeans he would not shell the town, near the Albanian border.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
people, and many want independence from Serbia, largest of the two
republics that form Yugoslavia.
	   Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, has been spearheading
international efforts to arrange peace talks between Milosevic and
leaders of the ethnic Albanian community.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army has been resisting
international calls to unite behind moderate Albanian politician
Ibrahim Rugova, who opposes violence. But diplomats hoped Serb
gains during the offensive might make the rebels more amenable to a
negotiated settlement.
	   On Wednesday, Hill met with KLA representatives and said they
showed interest for the first time in endorsing the idea of a joint
Albanian delegation.
	   An Albanian source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The
Associated Press that the rebels asked Hill for a week to decide
whether to accept the negotiating team.
	   Meanwhile, aid workers Friday searched the rugged hills around
sites of recent fighting in hopes of locating an estimated 20,000
people _ mostly Albanians _ displaced by the Serb offensive.
	   The search for missing civilians intensified after teams from
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees found at least
500 terrified ethnic Albanians hiding Thursday in the rugged hills
near Malisevo, which the KLA abandoned two days before.
	   Maki Shinohara, a UNHCR official, said the Albanians had little
food and no water and were fearful Serb police would hunt them
down. She said the refugee agency would try to ship them food and
supplies Friday or Saturday.
	   ``They're sleeping under the trees,'' another UNHCR official,
Tom Vargas, told CNN-International. ``A large number of women,
children and elderly are among them.''
	   In Geneva, UNHCR spokesman Kris Janowski said at least 100,000
people had been displaced since Milosevic launched a crackdown on
Albanian militants in February.
	   The United States and the Europeans reject independence for
Kosovo, fearing it would lead to similar demands among
Albanian-speaking communities elsewhere in the southern Balkans.

Japan's oldest person dies at 114

 &UR; Eds: ADDS personal background about Takii in grafs 6-7

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's oldest person, Asa Takii, died Friday at a
nursing home in southwestern Japan, the nursing home's director
said. She was 114.
	   Takii was born in Hiroshima in April 28, 1884. Her lifetime
encompassed almost the entire span of Japan's history as a modern
nation.
	   She witnessed her country's rise as an imperial power, its
crushing defeat in World War II and its resurgence as the world's
second-largest economy.
	   She lived in Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, when the United States
dropped the world's first atomic bomb. The blast killed her husband
and family and buried her in the rubble of her home until she was
found days later.
	   Takii kept her memories of the war to herself, said Kumiko
Nishiki, director of Tachibana-en nursing home on Kurahashi island
in Hiroshima prefecture, 670 kilometers (420 miles) southwest of
Tokyo.
	   Takii loved poetry and regularly wrote ``haiku,'' a traditional
Japanese form of short poem, Kyodo News reported.
	   News reports described her as cheerful but strong willed. When
at age 106 she felt she had lost the knack for composing haiku, she
announced she had quit and never wrote another poem, Kyodo said.
	   Takii died of heart complications stemming from high blood
pressure, nursing home director Nishiki said.
	   Takii's death leaves Tokyo-resident Tase Matunaga, also 114, as
Japan's oldest person, Kyodo reported.
	   Japanese have the world's longest life expectancy _ 83 years for
women and 77 years for men, according to the Health and Welfare
Ministry.

 &UR; Backstedt wins 19th stage of scandal-plagued Tour de France
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with day's stage

 &UR; By JEAN-LUC COURTHIAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AUTUN, France (AP) _ After losing another team before the day's
racing began, the Tour de France returned to home territory Friday
with the 19th stage won by Magnus Backstedt of Sweden.
	   TVM pulled out of the race Friday morning, reducing the field to
just 14 teams compared to 21 at the start.
	   Plagued by an ongoing drug scandal, just 96 cyclists started the
race's 19th leg, which began in Switzerland and ended in Autun,
France, after a leg of 242 kilometers (151.3 miles.)
	   A group of 13 riders broke away early and built up a big lead.
Less than two hours into the stage, the margin was up to more than
11 minutes. At the end, the pack was 16 minutes behind.
	   In the final kilometers, the 22-year-old Backstedt took a few
riders away and won in the final sprint. Maarten Den Bakker of the
Netherlands was second, Italiain Eddy Mazzolini third and Pascal
Derame of France was fourth.
	   It was the first time a Swede has won a stage of the Tour de
France.
	   Marco Pantani of Italy retained the yellow jersey despite
finishing behind the main pack. He was not concerned with the
leaders, all far behind in the overall standings.
	   Pantani still has a 5 minute, 14 second lead over American Bobby
Julich. Defending champion Jan Ullrich is 5:56 behind.
	   There is a final time trial on Saturday in Le Creusot. In the
last time trial of the Tour, Ullrich beat Pantani by 4:21. Ullrich
also beat Julich by 1:18.
	   With two days to go, the TVM team became the latest to quit.
	   Jean-Francois Pescheux, the Tour's sporting director, said the
TVM team, which is at the center of the ongoing drug scandal, had
informed him of its withdrawal. Staff at the hotel where the team
had been staying said they left early Friday for the Netherlands.
	   The team cyclists are supposed to report for questioning in the
French city of Reims on Monday following the end of the Tour.
	   ``The cyclists say they are tired and don't want to continue,''
Pescheux said. ``They're within their rights. We're a little
disappointed.''
	   The treatment of the TVM team on Tuesday night was the focal
point of the Tour riders' protest the following day that led to the
annulment of the 17th stage.
	   The team's riders, suspected of drug abuse, were taken to
hospital by police and given lengthy medical examinations,
including blood, urine and hair tests.
	   After the pack stopped twice during the next stage, the rest of
the leg proceeded slowly allowing the TVM riders to cross the line
first, raising their arms in symbolic victory.
	   Meanwhile, police said TVM masseur Jann Moors, being held in
custody, would be questioned Friday by an investigating judge in
the city of Lille.
	   The result meant Marco Pantani stayed in the leader's yellow
jersey.
	   Two Spanish teams, Kelme and Vitalcio, on Thursday angrily quit
the field, joining two other Spanish teams and an Italian team, who
quit Wednesday. A sixth team, Festina, was thrown out on July 17
after police found dopants in a team masseur's car _ sparking the
current scandal.
	   Investigators also prevented a cyclist from competing after
finding drugs in his possession. Rodolfo Massi of Italy was still
in police custody Friday after drugs were found in his room during
a search.
	   The scandal was clearly weighing heavily on the competitors.
	   ``I'm just trying to get to Paris in one piece,'' said Frankie
Andreu of the U.S. Postal Service team. ``It's been kind of hard,
mentally.''
	   Pantani has a lead of 5 minutes 42 seconds over American Bobby
Julich, with defending champion Jan Ullrich another 14 seconds
back.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Smoke from forest fires raging in Russia's Far
East is preventing firefighters from battling the blazes and
disrupting flights at a major regional hub, a newspaper said
Friday.
	   The smoke in the city of Khabarovsk is so thick that
water-carrying planes cannot take off to fight the fires 400
kilometers (240 miles) away.
	   Many arriving commercial flights must be diverted to
Vladivostok, 575 kilometers (350 miles) to the south, The Moscow
Times reported.
	   ``You can smell and even taste the soot in your mouth,'' said
Dmitry Lebedev, the Khabarovsk city environmental chief, according
to the newspaper.
	   Khabarovsk is Russia's main hub for flights to Asia.
	   More than 130,000 hectares (320,000 acres) of forest are burning
out of control in the region, though only a few remote settlements
are threatened so far.
	   Medical experts urged the residents of Komsomolsk-on-Amur, near
the fires, to leave the city if possible because of the smoke, the
Interfax news agency said. More than 200,000 people live in the
city.
	   Major fires are also burning on Sakhalin Island and the
Kamchatka peninsula.
	   An unusually dry winter and spring made the Far East more
vulnerable this year to the forest fires, which are normally
contained by summer. Lack of funds has also worsened the situation,
and specialists say that without significant rain, the fires may
continue until winter.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A preseason clash in Tokyo on Sunday between two
National Football League titans, the Packers and Chiefs, will be a
crucial test of Kansas City's revised offensive strategy.
	   ``We will have some things that we do that are much different
than in the past,'' Chiefs head coach Marty Schottenheimer told
reporters Friday after a morning practice session.
	   That means more ``passing the ball up field in 1998,''
Schottenheimer said later at a news conference.
	   The change was brought about by former running back coach Jimmy
Raye's promotion to offensive coordinator, where he replaces Paul
Hackett _ now the head coach at Southern Cal.
	   Schottenheimer said Raye has brought a fresh perspective to the
Chiefs' offense, especially in the passing game where the team had
previously relied on shorter, safer plays.
	   The new thinking calls for a more aggressive role by starting
quarterback Elvis Grbac, which is just fine by him.
	   ``I think it suits my abilities,'' Grbac said. ``Jimmy Raye has
given me the tools to go down field as much as possible.''
	   While starting players were expected to watch much of the
exhibition game in Japan from the safety of the sidelines, the
American Bowl will give coaches a welcome opportunity to size up
their second-stringers.
	   Among those in the spotlight will be Doug Pederson, Green Bay's
new primary backup quarterback.
	   ``The preseason is very important for Doug because he's our No.
2 quarterback now,'' said Packers head coach Mike Holmgren.
	   The Packers' No. 3 quarterback last season, Pederson got the nod
in April for his current spot _ a step away from leading the
two-time defending NFC champions. He had impressive passer ratings
of 83.2 and 94.4 in the last two exhibition seasons.
	   But he has struggled under his new title in training camp,
surprising both himself and the team. Green Bay's head coach
stressed the need for Pederson to grow into his role quickly.
	   ``He's going to get every chance to do that and I'm pretty sure
he can do that,'' Holmgren said.
	   For entrenched starters, the game will be a breeze. Packers'
star quarterback Brett Favre expects to play ``maybe about a
quarter.''
	   ``I'll try to do my best and give everyone a good show,'' a
relaxed-looking Favre said at a news conference in Tokyo on Friday.
	   Sunday's game is a match between two teams that faced off in the
first Super Bowl back in 1966, and, as National Football League
President Neil Austrian noted, could be a preview of the next
league championship.
	   Kansas City's Grbac agreed both teams have a good shot at
playing in the championship game next January.
	   ``The road to the Super Bowl starts here,'' he said.
	   Still, the Chiefs' Schottenheimer was keen to play down any talk
of a unbeaten 16-0 sweep for his team, a prediction which
apparently was started by defensive end Derrick Thomas after the
team signed two key players, Chester McGlockton and Leslie O'Neal.
	   ``The likelihood of that is about the same as the odds of
winning the lottery,'' Schottenheimer said, mindful of the Chiefs'
respectable 13-3 season last year and playoff loss to the Denver
Broncos.
	   The Packers, hit hard by free agency departures, also expect to
remain contenders after their bitter loss to the Broncos in the
last Super Bowl.
	   Green Bay head coach Holmgren hopes for another chance this
year, saying a number of players, including Reggie White, performed
well in training camp. A bad back had forced White's brief
retirement in the off season.
	   As for the controversy surrounding the defensive end's
appearance in anti-gay newspaper advertisements, Holmgren said
White's off-the-field advocacy won't have an impact on the team.
	   White was featured in his Packers' uniform earlier this month in
ads against homosexuality. Following an outcry, White and 15
sponsoring Christian groups said he would appear only in regular
attire in the future.
	   ``It's not distracting,'' said Holmgren. ``They all know Reggie.
We also know that he's going to speak his mind about the things he
believes in.''

Poles pay last respects to poet Zbigniew Herbert
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Polish leaders joined thousands of other
mourners, some carrying poetry books, at the funeral Friday of
Zbigniew Herbert, one of the country's most outstanding postwar
writers and moralists.
	   ``Poets have a gift of seeing the world more clearly and of
conveying that to their readers. I thank him that his showed our
generation and the future ones how to see the world,'' said
Cardinal Jozef Glemp, the head of Poland's Roman Catholic Church,
at the funeral Mass.
	   Polish Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek, the Sejm and Senate speakers,
other politicians and artists also took part in the funeral at
Warsaw's Powiazki cemetery.
	   Herbert was linked to the democratic opposition starting in the
1970s and became a Solidarity supporter in 1981. Protesting
communist policies, he left Poland in 1986 and settled in Paris. He
returned to Warsaw in 1992, three years after the end of communism.
	   In his poems, Herbert discussed moral problems facing the
present generations, drawing broadly from the humanistic tradition
of European culture, its classic works and myths.
	   Herbert who suffered from asthma and serious circulatory
problems, died in a Warsaw hospital Tuesday at age 73.

No Belgian vacation for young victims of Algerian violence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Families waiting at Brussels airport
Friday to welcome 100 Algerian children visiting Belgium for a
holiday returned home without their young guests after the plane
landed here without them.
	   The director of Handicap International, which had sponsored the
project with the help of an Algerian humanitarian group, flew back
to Brussels alone after failing to convince government officials to
let the children come.
	   ``The reason of my trip was to meet the Algerian government as I
was informed it is not very pleased by this project,'' Georges
Dallemagne told reporters at the airport.
	   ``But I didn't get to see anybody there, so I don't know what
the formal reason is. The usual reason is that the image of Algeria
might be tarnished by this kind of project, which is a reason I
don't understand.''
	   He said the children he met in Algiers had clearly looked
forward to the three-week trip and were ``really very sad'' they
couldn't leave.
	   These children are the victims of the violence in Algeria that
has left some 75,000 people dead in the last six years.
	   ``They have all been traumatized in one way or another,'' a
spokeswoman for the Algerian group Djezairouna said by phone from
Algiers.
	   ``Some of them have lost their parents in massacres, others have
seen people being butchered,'' she said. The organization deals
with the victims of violence, many of them children.
	   Families waiting at the airport expressed disappointment.
	   ``We hope to see her next year,'' said one young Belgian woman,
who was waiting with her daughter for a little Algerian girl.
	   ``In the meantime we intend to write to her as much as possible.
We won't forget her,'' she said.

Students from Indonesian province testify about alleged military
</HEADLINE>
abuses &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A dozen students from Indonesia's
northernmost province testified Friday before human rights
officials about alleged abuses by security troops.
	   In testimony at the office of the Indonesian Legal Aid
Institute, students from Aceh told of illegal detention and torture
at the hands of security forces. The military has long denied any
wrongdoing.
	   Syaiful Bahri, a 23-year-old student, said he was held for three
days in 1992 by government agents who questioned him about alleged
arms supplies to separatist guerrillas.
	   ``The soldiers tortured me by punching and beating my face and
my body,'' said Bahri, who was a junior high school student at the
time.
	   Over the years, Indonesian soldiers have conducted military
operations against a small band of separatist rebels in the
province of Aceh, which lies in northern Sumatra island.
	   There are also independence movements in the Indonesian
provinces of East Timor and Irian Jaya, where soldiers have clashed
with anti-Indonesian demonstrators in recent weeks.
	   In the wake of the resignation of President Suharto, his
reform-minded successor, B.J. Habibie, has promised to vigorously
pursue officials suspected of human rights violations, corruption
and other abuses.
	   A eight-member, government team began investigating reports of
official abuse in Aceh on July 26. It has received reports that at
least 1,679 people have gone missing in the province since 1988.
	   In the past, Indonesia has restricted the access of
international human rights groups to Aceh. But activists are
hopeful of greater freedom to investigate now that the
authoritarian Suharto, ousted in May following riots and student
protests, is no longer in power.

Authorities concerned by stray dogs in Ukraine's capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Concerned by packs of stray dogs roaming
the capital and biting its residents, Kiev municipal authorities
have decided to open a third animal shelter outside the city.
	   Mayor Oleksandr Omelchenko said Friday that two pounds were
already operating in villages near Kiev. The city government has
allocated 750,000 hryvna (dlrs 375,000) for a new one, he said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   In 1997, 6,787 residents of the city of about 3 million people
suffered from dog bites, almost one-third of them by strays,
according to municipal health authorities.
	   In the first six month of 1998 alone, 4,473 residents already
have turned to doctors for treatment of dog bites, including 1,700
people attacked by stray dogs, Interfax reported.
	   Media reports have put the number of stray dogs in Kiev in the
thousands. At night, their barking echoes through the capital.

Lloyd's of London wins legal fight against investors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lloyd's of London won a legal victory Friday that
lets it go after 150 million pounds (dlrs 245 million) from some
500 investors who lost a fortune in the insurance market but don't
want to pay up.
	   The investors, known as ``names,'' are individuals who, in
keeping with three centuries of tradition at Lloyd's, had put up
their entire personal wealth as collateral to back the company's
insurance policies.
	   When the market lost some 8 billion pounds (dlrs 13 billion) in
a disastrous period from 1988-92, many of the names complained they
had been cheated by Lloyd's insiders and refused to pay their
bills.
	   Lloyd's won a judgment against the investors in March, and on
Friday the Court of Appeal refused to let the names fight their
case any further, saying that ``would have served no legitimate
purpose.''
	   ``This is the end of the long road of litigation for those names
who have not paid their debts,'' said Philip Holden, who leads the
Lloyd's department that will pursue the investors' money. Holden
vowed ``all the appropriate enforcement measures will now be
pursued as quickly as possible.''
	   Lloyd's also said some U.S. investors have failed in their
attempts to avoid paying by going to bankruptcy court in New York
and California.
	   Lloyd's blamed its financial troubles on bad luck, namely a
string of natural disasters such as hurricanes, as well as
unanticipated troubles from pollution lawsuits.
	   The losses forced Lloyd's to radically shake up its business
that is famous worldwide for covering everything from the Titanic
to movie stars.

	   AUTUN, France (AP) _ After losing another team before the day's
racing began, the Tour de France returned to home territory Friday
with the 19th stage won by Magnus Backstedt of Sweden.
	   TVM pulled out of the race Friday morning, reducing the field to
just 14 teams compared to 21 at the start.
	   Plagued by an ongoing drug scandal, just 96 cyclists started the
race's 19th leg, which began in Switzerland and ended in Autun,
France, after a leg of 242 kilometers (151.3 miles.)
	   A group of 13 riders broke away early and built up a big lead.
Less than two hours into the stage, the margin was up to more than
11 minutes. At the end, the pack was 16 minutes behind.
	   In the final kilometers, the 22-year-old Backstedt took a few
riders away and won in the final sprint. Maarten Den Bakker of the
Netherlands was second, Italiain Eddy Mazzolini third and Pascal
Derame of France was fourth.
	   It was the first time a Swede has won a stage of the Tour de
France.
	   Marco Pantani of Italy retained the yellow jersey despite
finishing behind the main pack. He was not concerned with the
leaders, all far behind in the overall standings.
	   Pantani still has a 5 minute, 42 second lead over American Bobby
Julich. Defending champion Jan Ullrich is 5:56 behind.
	   There is a final time trial on Saturday in Le Creusot. In the
last time trial of the Tour, Ullrich beat Pantani by 4:21. Ullrich
also beat Julich by 1:18.
	   With two days to go, the TVM team became the latest to quit.
	   Jean-Francois Pescheux, the Tour's sporting director, said the
TVM team, which is at the center of the ongoing drug scandal, had
informed him of its withdrawal. Staff at the hotel where the team
had been staying said they left early Friday for the Netherlands.
	   The team cyclists are supposed to report for questioning in the
French city of Reims on Monday following the end of the Tour.
	   ``The cyclists say they are tired and don't want to continue,''
Pescheux said. ``They're within their rights. We're a little
disappointed.''
	   The treatment of the TVM team on Tuesday night was the focal
point of the Tour riders' protest the following day that led to the
annulment of the 17th stage.
	   The team's riders, suspected of drug abuse, were taken to
hospital by police and given lengthy medical examinations,
including blood, urine and hair tests.
	   After the pack stopped twice during the next stage, the rest of
the leg proceeded slowly allowing the TVM riders to cross the line
first, raising their arms in symbolic victory.
	   Meanwhile, police said TVM masseur Jann Moors, being held in
custody, would be questioned Friday by an investigating judge in
the city of Lille.
	   Two Spanish teams, Kelme and Vitalcio, on Thursday angrily quit
the field, joining two other Spanish teams and an Italian team, who
quit Wednesday. A sixth team, Festina, was thrown out on July 17
after police found dopants in a team masseur's car _ sparking the
current scandal.
	   Investigators also prevented a cyclist from competing after
finding drugs in his possession. Rodolfo Massi of Italy was still
in police custody Friday after drugs were found in his room during
a search.

New Bhutanese leader discusses refugee problem with Nepal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NIRESH ELIATAMBY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Bhutan's new head of government said
Friday the fate of 94,000 Bhutanese refugees living in camps in
Nepal was a serious problem that needed to be resolved quickly.
	   Jigmi Thinley discussed the question with Nepalese Prime
Minister Girija Prasad Koirala Thursday on the sidelines of a South
Asian summit and agreed it was ``a serious humanitarian problem
which demands an immediate response and action.''
	   The refugee question has been a severe strain on relations
between the two Himalayan kingdoms for the last eight years. The
two countries are divided on how to identify legitimate refugees
and weed out Nepalese citizens suspected of trying to make their
way illegally to the more prosperous Bhutan.
	   Thinley also met Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee
about India's claim that separatists active in India's remote
northeast have set up guerrilla camps inside Bhutan's jungles.
	   ``Our problem is that the forests are so thick that we have no
way of driving them out,'' Thinley told reporters. He promised to
act against the rebels. So far, Bhutan's small army has made no
attempt to dislodge the guerrillas.
	   The ethnic Nepalese, who migrated to southern Bhutan over many
decades looking for jobs, comprised nearly 25 percent of the
kingdom's 600,000 people by the late 1980s when the government
adopted its campaign of ``one nation, one people.''
	   Fearing their culture was under threat, some ethnic Nepalese
began a violent pro-democracy campaign for what they called
adequate representation in the government. A crackdown by the
authorities forced many Nepalese to leave.
	   Thinley, Bhutan's foreign minister, was elected chairman of
Buddhist kingdom's Cabinet a month ago after parliament endorsed
King Jigme Singye Wangchuk's plan to transfer power.

Cambodian parties continue complaints while awaiting vote tally

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Still awaiting final results from
Cambodia's parliamentary election, opposition parties on Friday
continued to allege cheating by the ruling party in the polls.
	   The FUNCINPEC party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh and the Sam
Rainsy Party issued a joint statement saying they would accept the
results of Sunday's poll ``when and if the serious irregularities
reported'' were shown not to have altered its outcome.
	   After meeting with Sam Rainsy, Ranariddh caught a plane for
Bangkok, Thailand, his base of operations for almost a year after
he was deposed in a July 1997 coup d'etat by Hun Sen, then his
co-premier.
	   His aides would not give a reason for his trip, but said he
would return in a day or two.
	   The Sam Rainsy Party also delivered an official complaint to the
government's National Election Committee charging that there were
systematic opportunities for cheating in the vote-counting process.
	   The opposition parties anticipate that official election
results, expected to be announced Saturday, will favor the
Cambodian People's Party of strongman Hun Sen.
	   Complete official results have been released so far from just 16
of the country's 23 provincial constituencies
	   A new controversy threatened to erupt Friday as reports
circulated that a new, little-known formula favoring the ruling
party would be used to determine the allocation of the winners'
parliamentary seats.
	   The new calculating method favors the party getting the most
votes in a given province.
	   Informed of the formula Thursday afternoon, the top independent
monitoring group, the Committee for Free and Fair Elections in
Cambodia _ COMFREL _ revised its projections to give Hun Sen's
Cambodian People's Party 64 parliamentary seats, FUNCINPEC 43 and
the Sam Rainsy Party 15.
	   Its earlier projection, based on an unofficial count of 90
percent of the ballots counted, showed the ruling CPP getting 59
seats, FUNCINPEC 45 and the Sam Rainsy Party 18.
	   The change is crucial because_ if the projection is correct _
without the extra seats CPP would fall short of having even a
simple majority in parliament.
	   Opposition politician Sam Rainsy blasted the apparent change in
rules as ``unfair, arbitrary and unconstitutional.''
	   COMFREL head Thun Saray said the National Election Committee
told him the new formula was adopted in April.
	   Asked about the existence of a new formula at a news briefing
Friday, a National Election Committee spokesman did not answer
directly, saying that the committee would not do anything against
the law.
	   An independent observer, Peter Schier of Germany's
democracy-promoting Konrad Adenauer Foundation, said he was also
caught by surprise and that the published election regulations
issued May 25, the day campaigning began, specified the original
seat-allocating formula.
	   Additional allegations of election fraud are continuing to
emerge, particularly from opposition party activists who made their
way to the capital from rural areas after being threatened by
police and local authorities loyal to the Cambodian People's Party.
	   Scores of such activists have taken shelter in the FUNCINPEC and
Sam Rainsy Party headquarters in Phnom Penh.
	   Friday's statement by the two parties asked Hun Sen's party to
help the investigations of election fraud ``by immediately ending
the campaign of intimidation it has mounted against our activists
in villages and communes across Cambodia.''
	   ``The testimony of these activists, many of whom are
eyewitnesses to electoral fraud, is essential to an assessment of
the election results,'' it said.
	   Opposition parties on Tuesday had already asked that new votes
be taken in disputed precincts if their charges of wrongdoing were
found to be valid.
	   They threatened to boycott the National Assembly if their
complaints were not heeded.
	   Without the opposition's attendance, the assembly is unlikely to
have present the two-thirds of its 122 members needed to conduct
any business.
	   Hun Sen responded by inviting them to join a coalition
government, but warning that saying that if they carried out their
threat not to attend the National Assembly, he could lower the
constitutional minimum for the assembly to meet and confirm a
government from two-thirds to 50 percent plus one. He also said his
current government could remain in power.
	   Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as his co-premier in a violent coup a
year ago, dismantling much of his political machine in the process.
	   Their co-premiership emerged from U.N.-sponsored elections in
1993 which were meant to usher in a new era of peace and democracy.
	   Ranariddh won, but Hun Sen, who came to power in 1985 under the
harsh Vietnamese occupation that followed the Khmer Rouge, forced
his way into a coalition by threatening war.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Sally Becker, a British aid worker
imprisoned by the Serbs in the embattled Kosovo province, will be
released and deported, diplomats said Friday.
	   Ms. Becker, who was detained on July 16 and charged to 30 days
in prison for illegally crossing the Albanian-Yugoslav border while
attempting to assist Kosovo refugees, will be released Saturday,
the diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity told the
Associated Press.
	   There was no independent confirmation and the Serb authorities
refused to elaborate. The diplomats said Ms. Becker will be
deported to neighboring Macedonia.
	   On July 23, she announced that she had stopped eating and
drinking in her prison cell in Lipljane, 20 kilometers (12 miles)
south of Kosovo's capital Pristina, to protest innocent victims of
the fighting in the Serbian province.
	   Ms. Becker briefly fell unconscious Monday after five days of
hunger strike, and had an intravenous fluid attached by Serbian
doctors.
	   She is known as the Angel of Mostar for her humanitarian efforts
in that Bosnian city during the 3 1/2 war.

Russians inspect Finnish military sites under Open Skies Treaty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Russian pilots flew their first
observer mission over Finland to inspect military sites under the
Open Skies Treaty, Finnish defense officials said Friday.
	   The flight, in a Russian An-30B, lasted several hours Thursday
and covered most of southern Finland, said Capt. Jukka Haltia from
the Defense Ministry.
	   ``It was a regular inspection flight, with officers taking
aerial pictures to check if the information about our forces,
training camps and military storage areas is correct,'' Haltia
said.
	   Finnish observers made a similar inspection flight over
northwestern Russia last month.
	   The 1992 Open Skies Treaty, signed by 27 countries, promotes
openness by allowing participating countries to gather information
about each other's military forces through unarmed observation
flights.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian People's Republican Party re-elected
former national security chief Alexander Lebed as its leader on
Friday, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Lebed now is governor of the huge Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia.

Celtic, Rangers seek to revive past glories
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ A first-round loser at the World Cup
for the eighth time, Scotland is in need of a boost when its
domestic season kicks off Saturday.
	   The national team came home two weeks early from the World Cup a
month ago and its latest flop produced more soul searching among
the players, coaches and administrators who are convinced Scottish
soccer is better than its record suggests.
	   Yet a whole generation has gone by since Scotland had teams
worth talking about.
	   Back in the mid-60s, Scotland outplayed England at Wembley only
a year after the English had won the World Cup at the same stadium.
	   Glasgow Celtic became the first British club to win Europe's
most prestigious trophy, the Champions Cup, in 1967. Rangers,
losing finalist to Bayern Munich in the Cup Winners Cup that year,
won the trophy five seasons later.
	   Players such as Denis Law and Jim Baxter were among the best in
the world then. Now the most eye-catching and successful Scots are
coaches rather than players and virtually all of them, including
Manchester United's Alex Ferguson, Leeds United's George Graham and
Newcastle's Kenny Dalglish, are employed in England.
	   Significantly, Scotland's top two clubs, Celtic and Rangers, no
longer have Scottish coaches.
	   Josef Venglos, a Slovak who guided Czechoslovakia to a European
Championship triumph in 1976, is in charge of Celtic while Dutchman
Dick Advocaat has taken over at Rangers after switching from PSV
Eindhoven.
	   Celtic begins the defense of its title at home to modest
Dunfermline Saturday while Rangers has a tough opener against
another title contender, Hearts, on Sunday.
	   Venglos will feel a little relieved after Celtic's 2-0 victory
in Dublin Wednesday over St. Patrick's Athletic in the Champions
Cup first qualifying round. That result followed an embarrassing
0-0 tie with the Irish semi-pros before 57,000 disgruntled fans in
Glasgow a week earlier.
	   Swedish forward Henrik Larsson is still a livewire attacker for
the green-and-whites, who also have Danish World Cup stars Marc
Rieper and Morten Wieghorst, Norwegian striker Harald Brattbakk and
Dutch midfielder Regi Blinker as well as eight of Scotland's World
Cup players.
	   Rangers no longer has English midfield veteran Paul Gascoigne or
Danish forward Brian Laudrup. But it's still hard to find a
Scotsman on the lineup.
	   The roster against Shelbourne in the UEFA Cup Wednesday had a
two Dutch World Cup players, Arthur Nurman and Giovanni van
Bronckhorst, German midfielder Jorg Albertz, Italians Lorenzo
Amoruso, Gabriel Amato, Sergio Porrini and Rino Gattuso, Finland's
Antti Niemi and Jonatan Johansson and Russian international winger
Andrei Kanchelskis. Sweden's Jonas Thern didn't even get onto the
field.
	   Hearts, a third place finisher in the 10-team division and
winner of the Scottish Cup, likely will be the main challenger
again while Aberdeen, which flirted with relegation last season,
hopes to improve under coach Alex Miller.
	   The Dons travel to promoted Dundee on Saturday while the other
matchups are Kilmarnock-Dundee United and Motherwell-St. Johnstone.

Former German intelligence service officer, accomplice, charged
</HEADLINE>
with spying &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ Germany's chief federal prosecutor
said Friday that a former top German intelligence officer and an
accomplice have been charged with fraud and spying.
	   A statement from the office identified the former officer only
as 49-year-old Helmuth D., who worked for Germany's BND foreign
intelligence service based in Pullach, near Munich.
	   According to the statement, the former officer committed the
fraud with a 49-year-old friend identified only as Alfred H.,
providing him intelligence information gathered by the BND. Helmuth
D. then would buy it back with government money as verification for
information the BND already had.
	   Helmuth D. claimed his friend had contact with high-level
Russian businessmen who initially provided mostly information on
illegal drug smuggling and money laundering, and later on the
political situation in the former Soviet Union, the statement said.
	   The men allegedly made contact twice a month from 1991-96, when
the former BND officer paid up to 250 marks (dlrs 140) for an
exchange of information, the statement said.
	   The two men are also accused of attempting to set up contacts to
sell BND secrets to an east European intelligence agency in 1997.
That backfired when the eastern agency contacted the BND to inform
them of the attempt, the statement said.
	   The men, who were arrested in September and released on their
own recognizance, are to be tried in the Munich high state court,
the statement said. No date has been set for the trial.

No Belgian vacation for young victims of Algerian violence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Families waiting at Brussels airport
Friday to welcome 100 Algerian children visiting Belgium for a
holiday returned home without their young guests after the plane
landed without them.
	   The director of Handicap International, which sponsored the
project with the help of an Algerian humanitarian group, flew back
to Brussels alone after failing to convince government officials to
let the children come.
	   ``The reason of my trip was to meet the Algerian government, as
I was informed it is not very pleased by this project,'' Georges
Dallemagne said at the airport. ``But I didn't get to see anybody
there, so I don't know what the formal reason is. The usual reason
is that the image of Algeria might be tarnished by this kind of
project, which is a reason I don't understand.''
	   He said the children he met in Algiers had clearly looked
forward to the three-week trip and were ``really very sad'' they
couldn't leave.
	   These children are the victims of the violence in Algeria that
has left some 75,000 people dead in the last six years.
	   ``They have all been traumatized in one way or another,'' a
spokeswoman for the Algerian group Djezairouna said by phone from
Algiers.
	   ``Some of them have lost their parents in massacres, others have
seen people being butchered,'' she said. The organization works
with the victims of violence, many of them children.
	   Families waiting at the airport expressed disappointment.
	   ``We hope to see her next year,'' said one young Belgian woman,
who was waiting with her daughter for an Algerian girl.
	   ``In the meantime we intend to write to her as much as possible.
We won't forget her,'' she said.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Train passengers traveling from Singapore to
Malaysia on Saturday were to be the guinea pigs in a standoff
between the two countries, bickering over where the Malaysian
customs and immigration post should be located on the railway line
that connects the perennially squabbling neighbors.
	   ``We don't know what will happen tomorrow,'' Singapore Foreign
Minister Shanmugam Jayakumar told Parliament late Friday in answer
to questions such as: Will the Malaysian border officials be
arrested if they try to clear passengers through customs at the
main railway station in downtown Singapore?
	   In Malaysia, Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik was equally
diffident. ``We have our contingency plans,'' he said. ``Tomorrow,
you will know.''
	   The first train was due to leave Singapore, heading for the
Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, at 8:15 a.m. (12:15 GMT)
Saturday.
	   For decades, customs and immigration for train passengers
between Singapore and Malaysia have been handled at platform booths
in the main railway station in the downtown Tanjong Pagar section
of Singapore. The causeway that separates the two countries is 18
kilometers (11 miles) to the north, and that is where buses, cars,
trucks and pedestrians pass through two separate immigration posts
on either side of the Strait of Johor.
	   The different arrangement for trains has a historic basis
because Malaysia still owns property along the railway line in
Singapore, dating from the years just after independence from
British rule. However, most of the daily passengers are Malaysians
workers who do not need to arrive in the central business district.
	   But in 1989, Singapore decided to move its railway customs post
to Woodlands, the checkpoint on the north tip of the island, just
across the water from Malaysia's Johor Bahru. Singapore said it
would be easier to interdict drug traffickers, smugglers and
illegal immigrants by stopping and checking trains at the actual
border.
	   Foreign Minister Jayakumar outlined to Parliament Friday a
history of the negotiations since then, saying that the Malaysians
first agreed, then disagreed with the change, first rejected
options, then accepted them after they had been withdrawn.
	   Abdul Kadir Mohamad, the secretary-general of Malaysia's foreign
ministry, said Thursday the issue blew up after Singapore
instructed Malaysia in April to relocate its facilities outside
Singapore. He called the move ``unfriendly'' and said that
``Singapore refused to change any of its positions.''
	   The news media in both countries have been used in propaganda
wars in a replay of past disputes over water, tourism, and other
issues.
	   Britain allowed Singapore to govern itself in 1959, with Lee as
prime minister. In 1963, Singapore was incorporated into Malaysia,
an experiment which failed two years later after wrangling between
Lee and the late Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman.
	   Affairs of the two countries are still tightly intertwined, with
Malaysia providing most of Singapore's water and hundreds of
thousands of its workers, while Singaporean businessmen are
principal investors in Malaysian business and industry.
	   Singapore went ahead building its new customs station to the
north, and said it would be operational as of Aug. 1, when the
Malaysian border checks in downtown Singapore would no longer be
legal. Singapore said it will make no sense to have Malaysian
customs officials checking train passengers into Malaysia before
the train gets to Woodlands where Singaporean officials are waiting
to check them out of Singapore.
	   ``Malaysian immigration officers performing immigration
functions at Tanjong Pagar will be acting without any legal
authority,'' said a travel advisory issued late Thursday by
Singapore.
	   ``All endorsements made by them on Singapore passports will be
unauthorized and improper. And foreign national passengers exiting
from Singapore with such unauthorized and improper endorsement on
their passports may face difficulties at Singapore immigration
checkpoints.''
	   No further explanation was given.
	   Meanwhile Malaysian Opposition leader in Parliament, Lim Kit
Siang called on Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong to intervene
to resolve the dispute.
	   ``This is not the time for saber rattling by both countries,
whether by governments or citizen groups but for the good sense to
prevail to avert a new round of Singapore-Malaysia tensions,'' he
said in a statement.

Hamburg state court lifts 1934 Nazi convictions of communists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ A Hamburg state court has lifted
Nazi-era convictions against 14 communists who attended a 1932
rally of Hitler's party where 18 Nazis were killed, officials said
Friday.
	   The 14 were not charged with the killings, but sentenced to long
prison terms for being communists and for allegedly working as
couriers. Four other communists were given death sentences for the
killings.
	   Despite a federal law clearing Nazi era convictions passed in
May, the state court ruled June 29 to clear the names of the 14.
Though the federal law has been approved by both houses of
parliament, it hasn't yet taken effect because it requires a
compromise over its wording to satisfy holdouts in Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's ruling coalition.
	   Conservatives have been reluctant to pardon deserters, fearing
it would be seen as a condemnation of the German military's conduct
during the war. Some opponents also argued that Germany had atoned
enough for the Nazi past.

Editorial comment criticizes suspension of anti-graft boss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ President Daniel arap Moi's decision to
get rid of the man he recently named to fight rampant corruption in
the East African nation will undermine confidence that Kenya can
deal with the problem, major newspapers said Friday.
	   ``The government has goofed once again,'' wrote the private
daily Business Africa, on the dismissal Wednesday of John Harun
Mwau as head of the Kenya Anti-Corruption Authority.
	   The independent Daily Nation, the largest newspaper in East
Africa, said the suspension ``sends the wrong signal'' on Kenya's
seriousness in pursuing corruption.
	   The East African Standard, usually close to Moi's ruling Kenya
African National Union party, warned the government to move
cautiously after having ``shot itself in the foot.''
	   Moi suspended Mwau, a former opposition presidential candidate
and karate expert, after he obtained arrest warrants for four
senior treasury and tax department officials and 11 other minor
officials for allegedly failing to collect 230 million shillings
dlrs 3.8 million) in duties on imported wheat and sugar.
	   A statement from Moi's office said he had set up a tribunal to
look into ``the proper performance'' of Harun's office.
	   A magistrate issued the warrants on July 16, but they were
declared null and void the following day the the Attorney General's
office.
	   Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae claimed Mwau's move was an
attempt to intimidate senior treasury officials who were only
carrying out his instructions.
	   Those implicated in the scandal _ all responsible to Nyachae _
are Kenya Revenue Authority chief John Msafiri, Customs and Excise
boss Samuel Chebii, Finance Ministry director of fiscal and
monetary affairs N. Njeru Kiria and finance secretary Joseph
Kinuya.
	   The anti-Moi weekly People newspaper claimed Friday that the
whole affair was connected with the power struggle over the
succession to the 78-year-old Moi, who has yet to name a vice
president following his re-election to a fifth term last December.
	   The anti-corruption unit was set up under pressure from the
International Monetary Fund which last August suspended a dlrs 220
million loan to Kenya because of the government's failure to stem
corruption.

EU opens inquiry into imports of steel stranded ropes, cables
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -The European Union has opened an
anti-dumping inquiry into EU imports of steel stranded ropes and
cables from Poland, Hungary and Mexico.
	   The EU's Official Journal said Thursday that the Liaison
Committee of EU Wire Rope Industries (EWRIS) complained in June
that these imports have increased sharply as a result of unfairly
low import prices.
	   EWRIS claimed the imports have led to declining sales, market
shares and income for EU producers of steel stranded ropes and
cables.
	   If the complaints are founded, the European Commission, the EU's
lending arm, could slap anti-dumping duties on these imports for a
six-month period.
	   The Commission can then recommend to EU governments to impose
duties for an extra five years. This decision is up to EU
ministers.

Japan's new prime minister says fixing economy his biggest priority
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; RECASTS; ADDS comments by new prime minister, finance
minister
 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Promising a ``fresh'' approach to solving his
country's pressing economic problems, Japan's new prime minister
said Friday his government will take prompt action to kick start
growth and fix the debt-ridden banking system.
	   ``This will be a fresh new Cabinet that will strive with all its
might to take decisive, speedy action to deal with difficult
problems,'' Keizo Obuchi said in his first news conference since
being elected premier by Parliament on Thursday.
	   No sooner had Obuchi spoken than new signs appeared Friday of
just how bad Japan's economy has gotten: The government announced
that Japan's unemployment rate surged to 4.3 percent in June, up
from two consecutive months at 4.1 percent.
	   The June figure is the highest since the government began its
current system of compiling unemployment data in 1953.
	   Hours after his election, Obuchi named the members of what he
has dubbed his ``economic recovery Cabinet,'' including a widely
respected former premier to be finance minister, the Cabinet's most
prominent economic post.
	   Obuchi said Friday he would move promptly to implement economic
stimulus measures he had promised while campaigning last week to
win his party's nomination as premier.
	   These include 6 trillion yen (dlrs 42 billion) in tax cuts to
bring Japan's rates down to U.S. and British levels, 10 trillion
yen (dlrs 70 billion) in extra public works spending and up to a 20
percent cut in the bureaucracy over five years.
	   ``I will definitely carry out these promises,'' Obuchi said.
	   Despite the pledges, the 61-year-old former foreign affairs
minister is considered by critics to be too beholden to the special
interest politics that dominate the Liberal Democratic Party to
take the bold, innovative steps needed to solve the structural
flaws of the Japanese economy.
	   He tried to reverse that image this week by naming former Prime
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa to take the finance minister's job.
Miyazawa, 78, is respected by many as an economics expert and is an
architect of the government's plan to fix its debt-laden banking
system.
	   Miyazawa pledged to open up the long-protected industry to the
sort of competition that experts say is necessary to weed out the
weaker companies.
	   ``It will be inevitable for unhealthy banks to close,'' Miyazawa
told state-run NHK television Friday.
	   Japan's banks are struggling to write off a growing burden of
loans that have gone bad or are at risk of default because of a
long slump in the nation's real estate market.
	   Because disclosure by Japanese banks remains so poor, the exact
size of the problem is still unclear. While the government
estimates that problem loans total 76 trillion yen (dlrs 535
billion), some estimates say the number may be twice that.
	   ``Without dealing with the financial bad loans, Japan's economy
cannot recover,'' Obuchi said. But he gave no details about what he
will do.
	   One of the first orders of business for Parliament, which began
a 70-day extraordinary session on Thursday, will be to pass
legislation put forth by outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
setting up a so-called ``bridge bank'' plan to liquidate failing
financial institutions.
	   The new government is under heavy international pressure to move
fast. In Washington, U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers said he hopes the new government will boost economic
growth, deal with the banking problems and accelerate deregulation.
	   ``These economic imperatives remain present with the political
changes,'' Summers said. ``We hope the new Japanese government will
move rapidly and effectively in each of these areas.''
	   In Thursday's vote, Obuchi won easily in the LDP-controlled
lower house. But the opposition-dominated upper house chose
Democratic Party leader Naoto Kan, considered Japan's most popular
politician.
	   Since the lower house has the power to overrule the upper house
in the vote for premier, Obuchi was declared the winner after a
conference between the two chambers failed to come up with a
compromise. It was the first time the chambers had split in a vote
for premier since 1989.
	   Obuchi's predecessor, Hashimoto, was forced to resign after his
party suffered a humiliating defeat at the polls earlier this month
in a vote widely seen as a referendum on the LDP's handling of the
economy.

	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   Numerous showers and isolated thunderstorms continued to move
westward across the coastal waters of the U.S. Virgin Islands and
Puerto Rico during the night. Some of the showers and thunderstorms
moved inland mainly across St. Thomas and over the east sections of
Puerto Rico. The winds were from the east southeast at 5 to 10 mph.
	   The showers and thunderstorms mentioned before were associated
with a weak tropical wave that moved over our area during the
night. By early Friday morning this system was already over the
east sections of Hispaniola. However, abundant moisture behind this
system will produce scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms,
especially across Puerto Rico this afternoon.
	   Tropical storm Alex continued to move west northwest across the
tropical Atlantic Friday morning. Residents and visitors in the
U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico should continue to monitor the

Butler says new analysis won't change U.S. findings on Iraqi gas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ New tests by European laboratories won't alter
the impact of U.S. lab results that found traces of deadly VX nerve
gas on Iraqi missile fragments, chief U.N. weapons inspector
Richard Butler said Friday.
	   Baghdad's suggestions that the U.S. lab's findings were biased
are ``unacceptable,'' Butler said. The lab was objective and
properly certified to perform the analysis, he said during a brief
visit to Beijing.
	   The findings frustrated Iraqi efforts to convince the U.N.
Security Council that it was revealing all about its programs for
weapons of mass destruction. The council's agreement would have
permitted it to end U.N. weapons inspections and lift sanctions
imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which touched
off the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Iraq disputed the U.S. lab findings and Butler agreed to new
tests by French and Swiss labs to verify the U.S. claims. Iraq has
said it was never able to move beyond experimenting with VX to
producing it in large quantities for weapons.
	   Results of the new analyses won't be known for weeks, but the
U.S. lab's findings will stand regardless of how they turn out,
Butler said.
	   Butler met with Chinese officials here on a two-day visit, his
first to Beijing as executive chairman of the U.N. Special
Commission.
	   China is one of the five permanent Security Council members, and
has mostly sided with France and Russia in calling for the
inspections to be wrapped up.
	   That has it pitted it against the United States and Great
Britain _ the other two members of the council _ who have taken a
tougher line on Iraq.
	   Butler said he told Vice Premier Qian Qichen in their talks that
China has a ``crucial role to play'' in helping conclude the
inspections.
	   Increasingly assertive in its role as an emerging superpower,
China has contributed experts to the inspection teams in Iraq as
well and played a larger role in formulating policy. Butler said he
thanked Qian for China's technical contributions, which also serve
to diversify and strengthen the U.N. mission's political
credentials.
	   Butler was to travel to Baghdad on Sunday for a new round of
talks with Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Sally Becker, a British aid worker
imprisoned by the Serbs in embattled Kosovo province, has been
released and is en route to Britain, diplomats said Friday.
	   Ms. Becker was arrested July 16 and sentenced to 30 days in
prison for illegally crossing the Albanian-Yugoslav border while
trying to help Kosovo refugees.
	   She was released Friday and deported to neighboring Macedonia,
where she caught a flight for Britain, according to diplomats who
spoke on condition of anonymity. Serb authorities refused comment.
	   On July 23, Ms. Becker announced that she had stopped eating and
drinking in her prison cell in Lipljane, 20 kilometers (12 miles)
south of Kosovo's capital Pristina, to protest innocent victims of
the fighting in the Serbian province.
	   She briefly fell unconscious Monday after five days of hunger
strike, and had an intravenous fluid attached by Serbian doctors.
	   She is known as the Angel of Mostar for her humanitarian efforts
in that Bosnian city during the 3 1/2 war.

U.N. finds 100 dead, fails to identify gunmen behind Angolan

massacre
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ A group of about 40 men used machetes,
automatic weapons and grenades to slaughter at least 100 unarmed
people in a night attack on a remote village, United Nations
officials said Friday.
	   A U.N. investigation found eight mass graves containing at least
100 corpses in the northeast of the country near the scene of a
massacre that has placed the country's fragile peace process in
jeopardy.
	   Government officials initially put the number killed in the July
21 attack at over 200.
	   A team made up of U.N. staff and officials from the government
and former rebel group UNITA probed the killings which took place
in Bula, a makeshift village of illegal diamond diggers about 250
miles (400 kilometers) east of Luanda.
	   However the team, which interviewed survivors, was unable to
identify the attackers, nor could it establish a motive for the
slaughter, according to U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst.
	   ``We know what happened there in physical terms. We just don't
know who did it,'' Wimhurst said, adding that the attackers fled
into the bush.
	   Survivors blamed UNITA troops but could not provide concrete
evidence for their accusation, Wimhurst said.
	   ``Survivors say it was UNITA because the gunmen were speaking a
tribal language traditionally associated with that movement's
supporters and because the gunmen were heavily-armed. But we need
more concrete evidence than that,'' Wimhurst told The Associated
Press.
	   The state-run media has accused UNITA of the slayings, fanning
sentiment against the group which signed a peace pact with the
government in 1994 to end a devastating two-decade civil war.
	   UNITA denies the charge and has expressed concern about the
accusations, saying they are further unsettling the country,
according to Wimhurst.
	   UNITA has insisted that the massacre was the work of rival
illegal diamond-diggers in the region who are feuding over the
richest patches of land.
	   The government has also accused UNITA of attacking rural towns
in several provinces in recent months, killing dozens of police and
civilians. The rebel group has denied those charges.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ was supposed to have demobilized its
70,000-strong guerrilla army, but the government claims the group
maintains armed men hidden in the bush.

Historians say Deutsche Bank profited from Holocaust victims' gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs, recasts, adds quote from German Jewish leader, Deutsche
Bank, additional detail from report. &QL; 
 &UR; By IAN MADER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Historians tracing the origin of gold
bars Deutsche Bank traded during the Nazi era confirmed Friday that
the bank profited from gold plundered from Holocaust victims.
	   The historians were unable to determine with certainty whether
bank executives knew that some of the gold purchased from the
Reichsbank, the Nazi central bank, came directly from Jews sent to
concentration camps.
	   However, they said it is ``likely'' that top officials of
Deutsche Bank, now Germany's biggest private bank, were aware of
the origins of some of the gold.
	   The leader of Germany's Jewish community, Ignatz Bubis, said the
conclusion could have been more strongly worded.
	   ``The people at the top, I think, all knew where the gold came
from,'' Bubis said. ``There was a conspiracy of silence.''
	   German television reported in December that the bank had bought
Reichsbank gold robbed from Jews.
	   Deutsche Bank said at that time it was unaware of the trading
and announced it had commissioned five historians from Israel,
Germany, the United States and Britain to research the origin of
gold it bought during World War II.
	   Separately, Deutsche Bank was named in a lawsuit filed June 3 in
New York on behalf of 10,000 Holocaust survivors and victims'
relatives. That lawsuit, still pending, alleges Deutsche Bank and
Dresdner Bank profited from the looting of gold and other personal
property from Jewish victims of the Holocaust.
	   The panel of five historians from Israel, Germany, the United
States and Britain conducted their research using the bank's own
microfilm records, the books of the defunct Reichsbank and files
from Degussa, which smelted the gold.
	   ``Gold played a deciding roll in financing the import of
strategic goods essential to the Nazi war efforts,'' the report
said.
	   ``The vast majority of the gold that Germany sold was stolen:
from central banks of vanquished countries, but also from
individuals, especially the victims of the Nazis' racist
persecution _ above all Jews.''
	   Given their connections and information available at the time,
Deutsche Bank officials ``could have known that the gold originally
belonged _ and ... still belongs _ to victims of Nazi Germany,''
the report concluded.
	   The report concludes that Deutsche Bank purchased 4,446
kilograms (4.9 tons) from the Nazi central bank during World War
II, and that at least 744 kilograms (1,637 pounds) of it stemmed
from Holocaust victims.
	   The 744 kilograms were linked through documents to gold looted
from Holocaust victims and collected by SS Capt. Bruno Melmer, the
historians said.
	   Trading most of the gold through its only overseas subsidiary,
in Istanbul, Turkey, the bank made a profit from 1941-43 of dlrs
378,000, or dlrs 3.4 million today. The historians said the profit
represented 0.15 percent of the bank's total profits during that
period.
	   Some of the gold, 323 kilograms (710 pounds), remained among
assets frozen into the 1950s in Switzerland at the request of the
Allies after the war, the report said.
	   That gold was sold in 1995. This March, the bank donated the
entire dlrs 3.1 million in proceeds to Jewish groups, saying it
suspected the gold may originally have been robbed from Jews.
	   Deutsche Bank released a brief statement Friday thanking the
historians for their work and saying the bank ``reaffirms its moral
responsibility for the darkest chapter in its history and deeply
regrets any injustices.''

Editorial comment criticizes suspension of anti-graft boss

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ President Daniel arap Moi's decision to
get rid of the man he recently named to fight rampant corruption in
the East African nation will undermine confidence that Kenya can
deal with the problem, major newspapers said Friday.
	   ``The government has goofed once again,'' wrote the private
daily Business Africa, on the dismissal Wednesday of John Harun
Mwau as head of the Kenya Anti-Corruption Authority.
	   The independent Daily Nation, the largest newspaper in East
Africa, said the suspension ``sends the wrong signal'' on Kenya's
seriousness in pursuing corruption.
	   The East African Standard, usually close to Moi's ruling Kenya
African National Union party, warned the government to move
cautiously after having ``shot itself in the foot.''
	   Moi suspended Mwau, a former opposition presidential candidate
and karate expert, after he obtained arrest warrants for four
senior treasury and tax department officials and 11 other minor
officials for allegedly failing to collect 230 million shillings
dlrs 3.8 million) in duties on imported wheat and sugar.
	   A statement from Moi's office said he had set up a tribunal to
look into ``the proper performance'' of Harun's office.
	   A magistrate issued the warrants on July 16, but they were
declared null and void the following day the the Attorney General's
office.
	   Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae claimed Mwau's move was an
attempt to intimidate senior treasury officials who were only
carrying out his instructions.
	   Those implicated in the scandal _ all responsible to Nyachae _
are Kenya Revenue Authority chief John Msafiri, Customs and Excise
boss Samuel Chebii, Finance Ministry director of fiscal and
monetary affairs N. Njeru Kirira and finance secretary Joseph
Kinyua.
	   The anti-Moi weekly People newspaper claimed Friday that the
whole affair was connected with the power struggle over the
succession to the 78-year-old Moi, who has yet to name a vice
president following his re-election to a fifth term last December.
	   The anti-corruption unit was set up under pressure from the
International Monetary Fund which last August suspended a dlrs 220
million loan to Kenya because of the government's failure to stem
corruption.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ A city council deputy from Taiwan has been found
dead in the northern Chinese town of Haicheng, a day after she was
reported kidnapped, police said Friday.
	   The body of Lin Ti-chuan, a member of southern Taiwan's
Kaohsiung city council, was discovered Thursday, said a policeman
from the Public Security Bureau in Anshan, a city near Haicheng in
Liaoning province.
	   Three employees of a Haicheng-based import-export firm have been
arrested in connection with her death, said the policeman, who only
provided his surname, Chen. The kidnappers had demanded U.S. dlrs
200,000 in ransom for Lin and her Taiwanese boyfriend, Wei
Dan-kang, Taiwanese media reported.
	   Lin's body was dumped at a hospital where her abductors had
taken her Wednesday after giving her a drug overdose, her aides in
Taiwan said.
	   State radio in Taiwan said the suspects were thought to be
business associates of Wei.
	   Wei reported the kidnapping on Wednesday after he escaped from
abductors in the port of Dalian, also known as Luda. Police were
unable to locate Wei on Friday, Chen said.
	   Preliminary investigation showed that Wei was deputy manager of
a Taiwanese trading company that owed U.S. dlrs 700,000 to a firm
in Haicheng, China's official Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   The incident is the latest in a rising trend of violence towards
Taiwanese in China, where many have business dealings.
	   The Straits Exchange Foundation, a semiofficial body handling
exchanges with China, says since 1991, it has handled 184 cases of
Taiwanese business people being kidnapped, extorted or threatened,
of whom 25 were killed.
	   Those incidents have a searing affect on Taiwanese feelings
towards the mainland, and Lin's slaying renewed concerns about
crime in China. Politicians from the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party, of which Lin was a member, urged Taiwanese on
Friday to stop investing in the mainland until China can ensure
their safety.
	   Also on Friday, newspapers reported a Taiwanese businessman,
Wang Fu-ching, was found dead in the southern Chinese city of
Shenzhen after visiting there to negotiate with his local partners
about pulling out of an investment.

Afghans caught at Hungarian-Slovak border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Thirty-four Afghans were caught at the
Hungarian-Slovakian border Friday trying to reach Western Europe,
the state news agency MTI said.
	   The group of 11 men, seven women and 16 children were
transported by Hungarian smugglers towards the border in five taxis
at Parassapuszta, 60 kilometers (35 miles) north of Budapest.
	   The Afghans planned to travel through Slovakia to Western
Europe, they told Hungarian authorities.
	   The Afghans, together with the five Hungarian smugglers, were
taken into custody by border guards.
	   It was the second such incident along the Hungarian-Slovakian
border in the past 24 hours.
	   On Thursday, 45 Kosovo Albanians were caught trying to cross the
border into Slovakia.

Vatican paper assails registry of gay marriages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ When the archbishop of Florence got back
from Africa he was in for a big surprise: The city council had
opened the common law marriage rolls to gay couples.
	   On Friday, in the pages of the Vatican newspaper, Cardinal
Silvano Piovanelli fired a broadside at the city for recognizing
something that ``is against the teachings of the church, that
doesn't correspond to our society's or to traditional
Christianity's concept of family.''
	   Florence is not the only city which has opened its common law
marriage registry to gays. So has Pisa, where two women became the
first in the nation to register on July 9, and in Voghera.
	   The registry is symbolic, but the symbol is a powerful one for
both gays and those who disapprove of their lifestyle.
	   The Roman Catholic Church teaches that homosexual activity is
wrong and the only acceptable family is the traditional nuclear
family.
	   ``The registry _ to my way of seeing _ doesn't alleviate the
suffering and the possible marginalization of those who might be,
and often are, the victims of homosexuality,'' the cardinal wrote
in L'Osservatore Romano.
	   Italy's leading gay association, Arcigay, has praised city
officials in Pisa, Florence and Voghera, and said opening the
registries, even though symbolic, is an important official
recognition of gay rights in Italy.

Videos of women crushing bugs, frogs costly for British man
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TELFORD, England (AP) _ A factory worker who imported videos
that featured scantily clad women crushing frogs, fish, lizards,
mice and insects under stiletto heels was fined Friday in what
British authorities say was the first prosecution of its kind.
	   Keith Twogood, 44, of Highley, was fined 2,000 pounds (dlrs
3,260) for obtaining the videos, which he admitted importing from
the United States. In them, the women toyed with the creatures
before ultimately squashing them underfoot.
	   Prosecutor Matthew Jowitt said the tapes featured the women
``playing with the creatures before their ultimate demise is
brought about by the flat of the foot or the heel.''
	   ``They were obscene because they were what is known as `crush'
videos,'' Jowitt said. ``The obscenity is increased by the
circumstances of the video in that they showed in the main scantily
dressed women wearing stiletto heels performing this act.''
	   One of the nine seized videos showed women stomping on an
assortment of diminutive critters _ even a snail. Another showed
``pinkies,'' newly born rodents, being crushed to death by a ``sexy
woman.''
	   A mail-order catalogue similar to the one used by Twogood to
purchase the dlrs 20 tapes featured a description of one of the
films by its star _ the voluptuous ``Goddess Express,'' described
as 23 with size 6 1/2 feet.
	   ``I love to step on tiny worthless vermin as I crush and grind
out their pathetic lives,'' it reads. ``I laugh as they worship me
the Goddess ... ha ha.''
	   Titles of the films, by a U.S. supplier called Expressions
Videos, included ``Clogs and Frogs,'' ``Crushfest'' and ``Toad
Trampler.''
	   ``We just can't imagine the market for this. That's what's
really worrying us,'' said Julie Briggs, a spokeswoman for the
Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
	   She said she and her colleagues were ``sickened'' by the tapes.
``You just can't imagine what motivates people,'' she said.
	   Customs spokesman Bill O'Leary said it was the first ``crush''
case to reach the courts.
	   Twogood's attorney, Edward Salisbury, said his client's life had
been miserable since his arrest. Twogood left the court without
commenting.

Celtic, Rangers seek to revive past glories
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: fixes nationality of Amato, 13th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ A first-round loser at the World Cup
for the eighth time, Scotland is in need of a boost when its
domestic season kicks off Saturday.
	   The national team came home two weeks early from the World Cup a
month ago and its latest flop produced more soul searching among
the players, coaches and administrators who are convinced Scottish
soccer is better than its record suggests.
	   Yet a whole generation has gone by since Scotland had teams
worth talking about.
	   Back in the mid-60s, Scotland outplayed England at Wembley only
a year after the English had won the World Cup at the same stadium.
	   Glasgow Celtic became the first British club to win Europe's
most prestigious trophy, the Champions Cup, in 1967. Rangers,
losing finalist to Bayern Munich in the Cup Winners Cup that year,
won the trophy five seasons later.
	   Players such as Denis Law and Jim Baxter were among the best in
the world then. Now the most eye-catching and successful Scots are
coaches rather than players and virtually all of them, including
Manchester United's Alex Ferguson, Leeds United's George Graham and
Newcastle's Kenny Dalglish, are employed in England.
	   Significantly, Scotland's top two clubs, Celtic and Rangers, no
longer have Scottish coaches.
	   Josef Venglos, a Slovak who guided Czechoslovakia to a European
Championship triumph in 1976, is in charge of Celtic while Dutchman
Dick Advocaat has taken over at Rangers after switching from PSV
Eindhoven.
	   Celtic begins the defense of its title at home to modest
Dunfermline Saturday while Rangers has a tough opener against
another title contender, Hearts, on Sunday.
	   Venglos will feel a little relieved after Celtic's 2-0 victory
in Dublin Wednesday over St. Patrick's Athletic in the Champions
Cup first qualifying round. That result followed an embarrassing
0-0 tie with the Irish semi-pros before 57,000 disgruntled fans in
Glasgow a week earlier.
	   Swedish forward Henrik Larsson is still a livewire attacker for
the green-and-whites, who also have Danish World Cup stars Marc
Rieper and Morten Wieghorst, Norwegian striker Harald Brattbakk and
Dutch midfielder Regi Blinker as well as eight of Scotland's World
Cup players.
	   Rangers no longer has English midfield veteran Paul Gascoigne or
Danish forward Brian Laudrup. But it's still hard to find a
Scotsman on the lineup.
	   The roster against Shelbourne in the UEFA Cup Wednesday had a
two Dutch World Cup players, Arthur Numan and Giovanni van
Bronckhorst, German midfielder Jorg Albertz, Argentina's Gabriel
Amato, Italians Lorenzo Amoruso, Sergio Porrini and Rino Gattuso,
Finland's Antti Niemi and Jonatan Johansson and Russian
international winger Andrei Kanchelskis. Sweden's Jonas Thern
didn't even get onto the field.
	   Hearts, a third place finisher in the 10-team division and
winner of the Scottish Cup, likely will be the main challenger
again while Aberdeen, which flirted with relegation last season,
hopes to improve under coach Alex Miller.
	   The Dons travel to promoted Dundee on Saturday while the other
matchups are Kilmarnock-Dundee United and Motherwell-St. Johnstone.

EU opens inquiry into imports of steel stranded ropes, cables
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union has opened an
anti-dumping inquiry into EU imports of steel stranded ropes and
cables from Poland, Hungary and Mexico.
	   The EU's Official Journal said the Liaison Committee of EU Wire
Rope Industries (EWRIS) complained in June that these imports have
increased sharply as a result of unfairly low import prices.
	   EWRIS claimed the imports have led to declining sales, market
shares and income for EU producers of steel stranded ropes and
cables.
	   If the complaints are founded, the European Commission, the EU's
lending arm, could slap anti-dumping duties on these imports for a
six-month period.
	   The Commission can then recommend to EU governments to impose
duties for an extra five years. This decision is up to EU
ministers.

 &UR; With BC-India-Pakistan-Nuclear &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistanis watched closely but with
little hope as their prime minister sat down with the leader of
their longtime rival. So news Friday that talks with India had
failed met with little more than shrugs.
	   ``I was not expecting much, very frankly,'' said Zafar Iqbal
Cheema, chairman of the department of defense and strategic studies
at Islamabad's Quaid-e-Azam University. ``Once again, there's a
kind of a deadlock.''
	   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his Indian counterpart Atal
Bihari Vajpayee met on a tropical island earlier this week for
their first talks since both ordered nuclear weapons tests in May.
They said they wanted to try to normalize relations that have been
poor since their two countries gained independence from the British
in 1947, and that deteriorated even further with the nuclear tests.
	   As has happened again and again over their long history of
hostility, the talks bogged down over how to resolve competing
claims to the Himalayan territory of Kashmir. Even as they met
Thursday, their armies were trading fire along the Kashmir border,
killing a total of at least 52 people on both sides.
	   Meetings in the Sri Lankan capital of Colombo broke up Friday
with Pakistan calling India ``rigid and inflexible'' and India
retorting that Pakistan was ``neurotic.'' No new talks were
scheduled.
	   ``The situation has become more grave and more serious, and
carries more serious consequences'' because both sides are
determined to build nuclear arsenals, Cheema said. Like his prime
minister, he suggested outsiders step in to mediate. India is
firmly opposed to international interference on Kashmir.
	   Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, speaking by telephone from
Karachi, called results in Colombo a ``disappointment,'' but
stressed that more talks had not been ruled out. She said that with
his economy crumbling and ties with old allies the United States
and Japan strained because of his nuclear tests, Sharif should go
to India and offer a no-first-use nuclear pact and talks on trade.
Only then should Sharif, her political rival, pursue a Kashmir
solution, she said.
	   ``It's a time for boldness and courage,'' Ms. Bhutto said of
what many might consider a humiliating capitulation. ``Kashmir must
obviously not be given up. But we can't allow lack of progress on
Kashmir to blind us to lack of progress in other areas.''
	   The Sharif-Vajpayee talks in Sri Lanka have been front-page news
in Pakistan for days, the stories illustrated by color photographs
of the two prime ministers in similar traditional dress shaking
hands, in grave conversation, even posed together against the
Indian Ocean surf.
	   Ironically, the photographs gave the impression of two old
friends on a summer holiday.
	   The ``much-awaited meeting'' failed to ``generate any hope of a
breakthrough in the two countries' relations,'' The Muslim
newspaper said in an editorial.
	   India took much of the blame. ``Anyone hoping that the pressure
of world opinion might force Mr. Vajpayee to make some move, even
the slightest one, towards addressing the core issue of Kashmir
that has pushed Pakistan and India into a nuclear confrontation,
has been proved to be unrealistic,'' The Nation said in its
editorial.
	   ``The whole world is watching us now,'' said Kunwar Khalid
Yunas, a member of parliament from the Mohajir Qaumi Movement, a
party that is part of Sharif's governing coalition. ``If both of
the countries would sit together seriously, changes could be
far-reaching. It's what the world expects, it's what the people of
the region expect.''
	   The Pakistani government never expected much. Foreign Minister
Gohar Ayub Khan kicked off the trip by telling reporters the talks
in Sri Lanka would likely produce what Indo-Pakistani meetings
usually do: ``Nil.''

Poles pay last honors to poet Zbigniew Herbert
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Thousands of Poles, some with flowers and
poetry books, turned up at the funeral of poet Zbigniew Herbert,
one of the country's most outstanding postwar writers and
moralists.
	   ``Poets have a gift of seeing the world more clearly and
conveying that to their followers. I thank him that he showed our
generation and the future ones how to see the world,'' said
Cardinal Jozef Glemp, the head of Poland's Roman Catholic Church at
the funeral mass.
	   Numerous politicians, including Poland's Prime Minister Jerzy
Buzek, the culture minister, parliament speakers and artists also
took part in the funeral at the Warsaw's Powiazki cemetery.
	   Herbert was linked to the democratic opposition starting in the
1970s and became a Solidarity supporter in 1981. Protesting
communist policies, he left Poland in 1986 and settled in Paris. He
returned to Warsaw in 1992, three years after the end of communism.
	   In his poems, Herbert discussed moral problems facing the
present generations, drawing broadly from the humanistic tradition
of European culture, its classic works and myths.
	   Herbert, who suffered from asthma and serious circulatory
problems, died in a Warsaw hospital Tuesday. He was 73.
	   He is survived by his wife, Katarzyna.

U.S. presses Milosevic to allow aid flow into Kosovo

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A U.S. envoy urged Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic on Friday to let aid workers deliver
food, medicine and blankets to tens of thousands of ethnic
Albanians who fled a major government offensive in Kosovo .
	   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, also
said Christopher Hill had also sought assurances that Milosevic had
called off the weeklong offensive in the province, as he promised a
European Union delegation Thursday.
	   Despite the pledge, scattered clashes were reported by both Serb
and Albanian sources Friday. The government's Tanjug news agency
said eight ethnic Albanian ``terrorists'' were killed and several
were arrested Friday when they attacked Serb police near Lipljane,
some 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of Kosovo's capital Pristina.
	   Three Serb policemen were seriously injured, the report said.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, under ethnic Albanian control,
reported heavy shelling Friday of villages close to the Albanian
border, including Junik, a rebel stronghold where thousands of
Albanian civilians were believed to have taken refuge.
	   The report could not be immediately confirmed. Junik has been
reported under government siege for five days, but Milosevic told
the Europeans he would not shell the town, near the Albanian
border.

Police arrest some 10 people in alleged subversion plot 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Police have accused 10 people of
plotting subversive acts against the government, radio stations
reported Friday.
	   The alleged ringleader is Roger Cazeau, a former army colonel
who retired in 1983 and remains at large, police spokesman Felder
Jean-Baptiste said at a press conference.
	   Jean-Baptiste said the accused were involved drug trafficking
and planned to use the proceeds to finance subversive acts. He did
not say when Cazeau and the others were arrested.
	   Cazeau, who is in hiding, denied the accusation.
	   ``With that accusation hanging over me, both my life and the
lives of my family are threatened,'' he told the private Radio
Vision 2000 in a telephone interview.
	   Others were skeptical of the accusations.
	   ``Every time the government is in difficulty, it attempts to
divert attention,'' said former interim police chief and 1995
presidential candidate Leon Jeune, in an interview with The
Associated Press on Friday.
	   Jeune was arrested Nov. 16, 1997 on subversion charges but
released a month later. In August 1996, some 20 former soldiers
were charged with plotting to overthrow the government but were
later released for lack of evidence.
	   Haiti has been without effective government since June 1997,
when Premier Rosny Smarth resigned to protest legislative elections
he said were tainted by fraud. Three attempts to nominate Smarth's
successor have been rejected by Parliament.
	   Meanwhile, international patience is wearing thin.
	   At the beginning of July, a U.S. congressional delegation warned
Haitian leaders that the U.S. Congress is inclined to cut all aid
if Haitians do not swiftly resolve the year-old power struggle.

U.N. finds 100 dead, fails to identify gunmen behind Angolan
</HEADLINE>
massacre &QL; 
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ A group of about 40 men used machetes,
automatic weapons and grenades to slaughter at least 100 unarmed
people in a night attack on a remote Angolan village, U.N.
officials said Friday.
	   A U.N. investigation found eight mass graves containing at least
100 corpses in the northeast, near the scene of a massacre that has
placed the country's fragile peace process in jeopardy.
	   Government officials initially put the number killed in the July
21 attack at over 200.
	   A team of U.N. staff and officials from the government and
former rebel group UNITA probed the killings in Bula, a makeshift
village of illegal diamond diggers about 250 miles (400 kilometers)
east of Luanda.
	   The team, which interviewed survivors, was unable to identify
the attackers or establish a motive for the slaughter, according to
U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst.
	   ``We know what happened there in physical terms. We just don't
know who did it,'' Wimhurst said, adding that the attackers fled
into the bush.
	   Survivors blamed UNITA troops but could not provide concrete
evidence, Wimhurst said.
	   ``Survivors say it was UNITA because the gunmen were speaking a
tribal language traditionally associated with that movement's
supporters and because the gunmen were heavily armed. But we need
more concrete evidence than that,'' Wimhurst told The Associated
Press.
	   The state-run media has accused UNITA of the slayings, fanning
sentiment against the group which signed a peace pact with the
government in 1994 to end a devastating two-decade civil war.
	   UNITA denies the charge and has expressed concern about the
accusations, saying they are further unsettling the country,
according to Wimhurst.
	   UNITA has insisted that the massacre was the work of rival
illegal diamond-diggers feuding over the richest patches of land in
the region.
	   The government has also accused UNITA of attacking rural towns
in several provinces in recent months, killing dozens of police and
civilians. The rebel group has denied those charges.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ was supposed to have demobilized its
70,000-strong guerrilla army, but the government claims the group
maintains armed men hidden in the bush.

Nigerian tests positive at World Championship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS FIBA statement with Nwsou suspended &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Nigerian center Julius Nwosu was suspended
Friday from the World Basketball Championship after testing
positive for the banned substance ephedrine, officials of FIBA said
Friday.
	   It was the first positive drug test of the two-week tournament.
FIBA, the sport's world governing body, said in a brief statement
that Nwosu had been suspended but did not specify for how long.
	   FIBA said Nwosu's A-sample contained ``ephedrine/nor-ephedrine
at an abnormally high level.''
	   Ephedrine is classed as a stimulant and is typically found in
cold medications. Its use normally carries a warning or a ban of
three months or fewer.
	   The 27-year-old tested positive after Nigeria's 80-68 loss to
Spain on Wednesday, the opening day of the championship.
	   FIBA said Nigeria's games were not subject to forfeit. They lost
their first two and played and late match Friday against Australia.
	   Nwosu has had short stints in the CBA and NBA and is now with
Galatasaray in the Turkish League.
	   He was suspended indefinitely by the Connecticut Pride of the
CBA in January for conduct detrimental to the team. He also was
briefly with the NBA's San Antonio Spurs and Boston Celtics.
	   The world of sports has been rocked in recent days by a series
of doping scandals, including in the Tour de France, track and
field and swimming.

German plan to split up Rolls-Royce sends boss packing

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The plan by two German automakers to divide
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars prompted the company's chief executive to
resign Friday, bringing further uncertainty to the luxury carmaker.
	   Graham Morris said the shakeup announced by Volkswagen AG, which
bought the factory, and rival BMW, which bought the Rolls-Royce
brand name, made his position untenable.
	   ``I now feel that it is in the best interests of all concerned
that VW appoint a successor for my role,'' Morris said in a
statement. He then left for vacation, declining further comment.
	   Morris' departure was the second sensational loss of the week
for VW, which conceded Tuesday it will have to let its archrival
BMW take over production of Rolls-Royces in a few years.
	   VW paid 479 million pounds (dlrs 790 million) for Rolls-Royce
Motor Cars, but it will end up with only the Rolls-Royce factory in
Crewe, England, as well as the lesser-known but better-selling
Bentley line of luxury cars.
	   BMW, meanwhile, lost the bidding for the Rolls-Royce company but
paid just 40 million pounds (dlrs 66 million) for one of the auto
industry's biggest prizes _ the Rolls-Royce brand name and logo.
	   BMW has announced plans to start up a new Rolls-Royce Motor Cars
company on Jan. 1, 2003, but will let VW use the brand name for
free until then.
	   The German deal was a devastating blow for the 48-year-old
Morris. Ever since Rolls-Royce's former corporate parent, the
engineering conglomerate Vickers PLC, put the carmaker up for sale
in October, Morris had assured his 2,200 workers that all
operations would stay in Crewe.
	   Morris said he decided to quit ``based upon the recent
announcements that could potentially see the Rolls-Royce business
move away.''
	   The tabloid Daily Mail reported that Morris told colleagues
Thursday he would leave ``as a matter of honor,'' after seeing his
promises will not be kept under the new deal between BMW and VW.
	   The cloudy outlook at Rolls-Royce has pushed new orders down by
about 30 percent since mid-June, Morris said earlier this week.
	   VW's hopes of running the whole Rolls-Royce operation were
thwarted when it bought the factory from Vickers but was unable to
obtain the brand name rights that were held by the British jet
engine maker Rolls-Royce PLC. Rolls-Royce PLC prefered a pact with
BMW, its partner in a major aerospace venture.
	   Despite his resignation, Morris predicted the VW-BMW deal ``will
bring short-term stability back to the Rolls-Royce and Bentley
businesses, and I am still convinced that the long term holds out
very positive opportunities for our employees.''
	   Morris said he maintained ``the greatest respect'' for VW and
its chairman, Ferdinand Piech. Piech had stressed in a news
conference Tuesday that he wanted to keep Morris in charge of
Rolls-Royce.
	   Piech pointed out he had lost Morris as an employee once, when
Morris left an executive sales job at VW's subsidiary Audi to join
Rolls-Royce in April 1995. The VW boss said he had no intention of
letting Morris get away a second time.
	   ``No. He's mine,'' the German executive joked.
	   Not for long. Morris said Friday he would stay in his job only
until VW can find a replacement. VW offered no immediate hints
about who it might hire, but said it hopes to act ``as soon as
possible.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A U.S. envoy urged Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic on Friday to let aid workers deliver
food, medicine and blankets to tens of thousands of ethnic
Albanians who have fled into the hills of Kosovo to escape a major
government offensive.
	   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, also
said that Christopher Hill would seek assurances that Milosevic has
called off the weeklong offensive in the province, as he promised a
European Union delegation Thursday.
	   Despite the pledge, scattered clashes were reported by both Serb
and ethnic Albanian sources Friday. The government's Tanjug news
agency said eight ethnic Albanian ``terrorists'' were killed and
several were arrested Friday when they attacked Serb police near
Lipljane, some 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of Kosovo's capital,
Pristina. Three Serb policemen were seriously wounded, the report
said.

IMF official in Moscow to discuss loan package

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A senior International Monetary Fund official
returned to Moscow on Friday to press Russia to enact economic
reforms that were demanded in exchange for a huge international
loan.
	   The IMF denied the fund is considering further loans to Russia,
whose markets remain skittish despite the promised dlrs 22.6
billion cash infusion.
	   Both the ruble and the stock market closed slightly lower
Friday, reflecting continued uncertainty about the government's
ability to address fundamental problems in the economy.
	   Stanley Fischer, first deputy managing director of the IMF, was
scheduled to hold talks Friday and Saturday with Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko, his finance minister and the chairman of the
Central Bank about cutting spending and improving tax collection.
	   Coming less than three weeks after the IMF approved its portion
of the bailout, Fischer's visit appeared to be hastily arranged.
Yet IMF officials denied that the visit signaled any major
problems.
	   ``He (Fischer) is on a working visit to assess together with the
Russians whether everything that needs to be done to insure
implementation of the program is indeed being done,'' said Martin
Gilman, head of the IMF's Moscow office.
	   The Communist-dominated parliament opposes many of the reforms
and the government has been forced to implement some by decree.
International lenders are intent on keeping up pressure on the
government to follow through with its promises, which have often
been allowed to melt away in the past.
	   Fischer is also scheduled to meet Anatoly Chubais, the
government's envoy to international lending institutions, who spent
three hours Friday bringing Russian President Boris Yeltsin up to
date on economic developments.
	   The IMF deputy is to meet Saturday with the aggressive new
chairman of the State Taxation Service, Boris Fyodorov, the
Interfax news agency said. Poor tax collection is one of the major
problems of the Russian economy.
	   However, Fyodorov said Friday that the government had collected
500 million rubles (dlrs 80.6 million) more in taxes in July than
the 11.2 billion rubles (dlrs 1.8 billion) it collected in June. It
expects to collect 12 billion rubles (dlrs 1.9 billion) in August,
he said.
	   The government also said that the natural gas monopoly Gazprom,
Russia's largest company and one of its biggest tax-dodgers, had
paid its July tax bill of 2.5 billion rubles (dlrs 40 million) in
full.
	   Fyodorov had threatened to seize Gazprom's assets if it didn't
pay up. Gazprom maintains the government owes it more in unpaid gas
bills than the company owes in taxes.
	   Gazprom's July taxes account for 21 percent of all tax revenue
for that month.

Eight jailed in family child abuse ring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Eight people were jailed Friday for their parts in
a family sex abuse ring that the judge described as ``wickedness
beyond belief.''
	   A ninth person _ a woman _ was given a suspended jail sentence.
	   Judge William Taylor said children and grandchildren were abused
for pleasure and called the crimes ``the worst abuse of children
contemplated by the criminal law.''
	   The nine were convicted of nearly 80 charges of rape, indecent
assault and serious sexual offenses covering a period between 1961
and 1995.
	   Taylor forbade the identification of the family, or the
publication of any other information that might identify the
victims and abusers.
	   The grandfather, convicted of 26 offenses, including rapes,
indecent assaults and serious sexual offenses on his children and
grandchildren, was sentenced to 25 years.
	   His wife was jailed for 14 years by Judge Taylor, who said she
had known from the beginning what her husband was doing to their
children, and had herself selected them for abuse.
	   He said the grandmother, convicted of six offenses, had
humiliated her children, ignored their complaints, and laughed
while her husband abused their granddaughter at their home.
	   The couple's son-in-law, convicted of 15 offenses, was jailed
for 18 years. His wife was sentenced to two years, with the
sentence suspended for two years, after admitting a charge of rape
involving her daughter.
	   An elderly neighbor was jailed for 16 years for seven offenses.
	   The judge said the man had taken pleasure in inflicting pain on
the children and grandchildren.
	   Also in the dock were two of the grandparents' three sons.
	   One of them, who was convicted of 14 offenses involving his two
daughters and two nieces _ was jailed for 14 years.
	   His wife, convicted of six offenses involving rape and indecent
assaults, was jailed for five years. The judge said she had
assisted in a significant way.
	   A male cousin of the family who was convicted of three offenses,
photographed the abuse of the children 25 years ago.
	   ``You did nothing despite their suffering,'' the judge said as
he jailed the man for five years.
	   A second son, convicted of one offense of raping one of his
sisters at knifepoint when he was 16, was jailed for three years.
	   ``Degradation and humiliation were used as a tool to subjugate
these children and to ensure their silence and cooperation,'' he
said. ``If they resisted or complained they were hurt more.
	   ``These children led pitiful lives.''

Prisoners escape, wage shootout with police in Russian Far East
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with second policeman killed, two convicts killed, six
captured and three escaped. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police killed two of 11 convicts who escaped from
a remote prison in Russia's Far East on Friday and captured six
others, the Interior Ministry said.
	   The remaining three convicts fled into the hills of the Chukotka
Peninsula where they were hidden by fog.
	   The convicts killed a police officer and stole a large number of
weapons before escaping from the prison and fleeing in two stolen
trucks and an armored vehicle.
	   With the help of armored vehicles and three helicopters, law
enforcement officials corralled the fugitives, six of whom were
soldiers suspected of murder, according to the Interfax news
agency. The other five were civilians convicted of rape and
robbery.
	   But when the police called from helicopters for the escapees to
give themselves up, the convicts opened fire with rifles, Interfax
said.
	   Two policeman were killed and another injured during the ensuing
shootout, the Interior Ministry said. Two convicts were killed and
one shot himself, the ITAR-Tass news agency said, quoting Maj.-Gen.
Igor Zubov of the Interior Ministry.
	   Interfax said the prisoners had stolen 23 assault rifles, 32
handguns, five shotguns, a machine gun, hand grenades, ammunition
and bullet-proof vests during their escape from a prison on the
Chukotka Peninsula near the Bering Sea.
	   Police said they had the advantage in the stand-off because the
Chukotka Peninsula is so far north that the sun would not go down
far enough to provide adequate darkness for the prisoners to
escape.

Sydney residents fear city's polluted tap water
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to ADD dead foxes found in water, hundreds of
people becoming ill, water treatment plant did not filter out
parasites; RECASTS. No pickup. &QL;

 &UR; By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Panicked residents stocked up on
bottled water in Sydney on Friday amid fears that a treatment plant
had pumped parasite-polluted water throughout the city.
	   Fleets of trucks delivered bottled water to businesses, schools,
hospitals and homes as Sydney's 3.7 million residents were warned
to boil their drinking water to make it safe. Vendors sold small
bottles of water to drivers at stop lights.
	   Tests around the city earlier this week turned up signs of
contamination in a small area of downtown. But emergency warnings
were expanded to include suburban areas after the outbreak was
found to be much more widespread than originally thought.
	   A hotline was inundated with calls Friday from people concerned
that they might have drunk tainted water and hundreds of people
reported stomach upsets.
	   Angry residents were demanding to know how the parasites
cryptosporidium and giardia spread through the water system.
	   Authorities admitted failing consumers by not issuing early
warnings to all residents and promised an investigation. Sydney
Water also said that the treatment plant did not filter for one of
the parasites.
	   The parasites have an incubation period of about a week, so any
serious health problems are expected to develop next week.
	   Cryptosporidium causes symptoms similar to flu and can kill
people with weak immune systems, such as elderly people and
patients recovering from surgery. Giardia, normally spread through
human or animal fecal matter, can cause diarrhea and other
gastrointestinal problems.
	   Urban Affairs Minister Craig Knowles said Friday that dead dogs
have been found in a canal leading to the treatment plant. Sydney
Water Managing Director Chris Pollett said foxes were found as
well. But it was not known whether the animals contaminated the
water.
	   ``How they've got in there, goodness only knows,'' Knowles told
Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   Pollett said the water system was being flushed and he hoped the
tap water would be safe to drink in 48 hours. Water mains have been
opened, and water gushed down curbs as the system was cleaned out.
	   Meanwhile, city residents were told to boil water for at least
60 seconds _ and preferably for three minutes _ to avoid the
parasites.
	   In 1993, an outbreak of cryptosporidium in Milwaukee's drinking
water contributed to the death of an estimated 100 people, many
with immune systems already weakened by AIDS or cancer. More than
400,000 others got sick.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and U.S. Secretary of
Defense William Cohen arrived Thursday with a contingent of
American reporters to be greeted by Intercontinental Hotel bellhops
informing them the tap water was not safe to drink. The two
officials are in Australia for annual consultations with their
counterparts.
	   The tainted water prompted fears that Sydney's reputation has
been damaged ahead of the 2000 Olympic Games there. Sydney Water,
the city's water agency, had run ad campaigns featuring prominent
Olympic athletes endorsing the water's purity.
	   ``Having gone to the trouble of winning the Olympics, the very
least a state government could do is make sure that the water is
not poisonous,'' federal Sports Minister Andrew Thompson said.
	   ``Of course it's embarrassing,'' Prime Minister John Howard told
a radio station. ``It's one of those unexpected things and
everybody here's hoping it will be fixed up as soon as possible.''

Turkish Cyprus condemns Strasbourg ruling, rules out peace talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash
condemned on Friday a European Court ruling, saying it closed the
door to any peace talks with Greek Cyprus.
	   The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg had ordered
Turkey to pay 320.000 Cyprus pounds (dlrs 704.000) to Titina
Loizidou, a Greek Cypriot refugee, for depriving her of the use of,
and access to, her property in Kyrenia, a port in what is now
Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus.
	   The court held that Turkey, as the occupying power, was
responsible for developments in the north and it rejected any legal
status for the Turkish Cypriot breakaway state.
	   Denktash, who heads the Turkish Cypriot administration, said the
decision amounted to the ``total closure of all doors'' between
Turks and Greeks on Cyprus, which has been divided since Turkey
invaded in 1974 after a coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   ``Until this decision is reversed, there will be no discussions
with the Greek Cypriot side on bicommunality,'' Denktash said,
referring to repeated calls by the United States and the European
Union for him to resume U.N.-chaired reconciliation talks.
	   ``The court's decision closes its eyes to the realities of
Cyprus, to the 35 year-old situation,'' Denktash said, recalling
the outbreak of inter-ethnic strife in Cyprus in 1963.
	   ``(The decision) ignores the laws, disrupts human rights at the
root, is biased and politically-motivated,'' he said.
	   Turkey rejected the ruling Thursday, maintaining that
responsibility for events in the north lay with the Turkish Cypriot
state.
	   The Cypriot government, however, welcomed the court ruling
Friday as ``a landmark decision that sets a legal precedent'' for
all the 180,000 Greek Cypriot refugees from the north.
	   Attorney-General Alecos Markides said that Turkey was obliged to
respect the ruling and that if it fails to do so, it will face the
risk of being expelled from the Council of Europe and lose all hope
of joining the 13-member European Union.
	   The court of human rights falls under the 40-member Council of
Europe.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Animal rights activist Brigitte Bardot
appealed to Austrians on Friday to boycott Viennese artist Hermann
Nitsch's six-day art extravaganza which will include slaughtering
three bulls on stage and using their blood and entrails to create
``art.''
	   During a press conference, the former film star called on
Austrian authorities and members of the European Union to denounce
the performance, which is to begin Monday at Nitsch's private
castle in Prinzendorf about 50 miles (30 miles) north of here.
	   She also contacted a leading Austrian media lawyer to file an
injunction to stop the performance for ``pushing the limits of
art.''
	   ``I call on the Austrian people to boycott the murders of Mr.
Nitsch,'' Bardot said.
	   During the performance, which represents the culmination of
Nitsch life's work, three bulls are to be slaughtered by
professional butchers under the watchful eye of licensed
veterinarians.
	   While Bardot acknowledged that animals are slaughtered around
the world each day, she argued that making a public spectacle of
``killing and watching them suffer'' was ``morbid.''
	   ``I have never heard of a performance where animals are murdered
and where people pay to rejoice in the suffering of animals,'' she
said. ``Have you ever been to a slaughterhouse as a spectator?''
	   The coming marathon performance is not the first time Nitsch,
whose art has been controversial since the 1960s, has used animals
as part of his presentation.
	   Nitsch's previous performances have included actors covered in
animal entrails and mixing them with grapes. Those who want to
attend all six days of the performance must pay 7,000 Austrian
schillings (dlrs 580).
	   For one day, the admission drops to 3,000 schillings (dlrs 250).
	   Bardot said she had never heard of the 60-year-old Austrian
artist until Thursday, when she learned of the planned performance.
She immediately launched her appeal to put an end to the ``murder
of innocent animals.''
	   ``It is never to late to do something good,'' she said. ``If
this were not important, I wouldn't have left the Cote d'Azur to
come here.''
	   Nitsch is widely known in his native Austria, both for his
paintings and his often-controversial performances on stage,
occasionally involving naked women and crucifixes.
	   His paintings hang in some of the world's premier museums,
including the Guggenheim and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New
York and the Tate Gallery in London.

Author Arthur Hailey among victims of dinner party robbery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ The dinner party robbery might have been
a scene out of an Arthur Hailey novel _ except that Hailey,
himself, was one of the victims and the gun was definitely not
fictional.
	   The Nassau Tribune reported Thursday that Hailey and his wife,
Sheila, were robbed Wednesday night by two intruders, though nobody
was injured.
	   ``We'd just finished dinner, the six of us _ Lester and Anne
Smith, our hosts, Baroness dePosson, Michael Withers and ourselves
_ when two masked bandits, brandishing handguns and knives, walked
into the room with Catherine, the Smiths' youngest daughter,'' said
Hailey.
	   At first they thought it was a prank, but Catherine's ashen face
convinced them it was real, Hailey said.
	   ``When you're looking down the barrel of a gun you know you
don't fool around,'' said Hailey, who is 78 and had open-heart
surgery last year.
	   The robbers were completely covered by clothing and wore gloves,
but Hailey said he thought one of them was a woman. They made off
with jewelry and possibly some cash and fled in the Smiths' car,
which was later recovered by police.
	   Hailey's latest novel, ``Detective,'' is currently on several
bestseller charts.

Slovenes, Croats meet over the power feud
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Slovenia must urgently restore power
supplies to Croatia from their jointly-owned plant, while Croatia
will pay its ``real'' debts, Jasna Boric, Croatian deputy economics
minister, said Friday.
	   Boric spoke before the meeting with her Slovene colleagues,
aimed at mending the two countries' relations after Slovenia's
electricity company Thursday stopped supplying Croatia with
electricity from the nuclear plant of Krsko.
	   Slovenia said the Croatian government had not paid its bills,
amounting to a total of dlrs 14 million. Boric claimed Croatia's
debt is about dlrs 8.8 million.
	   She said Slovenia's move was ``unacceptable,'' and added that
the time-frame in which Croatia would pay its debts should be
established at the meeting.
	   Boric also told Croatia's HINA news agency that if Slovenia
doesn't re-open the transmission lines from Krsko, relations
between the two neighboring countries ``could be jeopardized and
Croatia could be forced to take counter-measures.'' She did not
elaborate.
	   Krsko supplies Croatia with about 15 percent of its power needs.
But the dispute represents the first serious quarrel between the
two former Yugoslav republics, which simultaneously proclaimed
independence in June 1991.
	   The Krsko plant, the only nuclear plant in former Yugoslavia,
was built jointly by Croatia and Slovenia in 1980s, but it is based
in Slovenia.
	   After their split, ownership and management over the plant
remained a constant dispute. Recently, the two argued over who
should finance the plant's upgrading.
	   Meanwhile, Croatian state electricity company accused Slovenes
of endangering the security of Krsko by turning off two of its
three transmission lines.
	   The company said such a move is against all the nuclear security
principles, which prescribes avoiding changes in the reactor's
work. It said it would seek an opinion from the International
Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna.

BC-Germany-Nazi Gold, 1st Ld-Writethru

 &UR; Historians say Deutsche Bank profited from Holocaust victims' gold &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: AMs, recasts, adds quote from German Jewish leader, Deutsche
Bank, additional detail from report. &QL; 
 &UR; By IAN MADER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Historians tracing the origin of gold
bars Deutsche Bank traded during the Nazi era confirmed Friday that
the bank profited from gold plundered from Holocaust victims.
	   The historians were unable to determine with certainty whether
bank executives knew that some of the gold purchased from the
Reichsbank, the Nazi central bank, came directly from Jews sent to
concentration camps.
	   However, they said it is ``likely'' that top officials of
Deutsche Bank, now Germany's biggest private bank, were aware of
the origins of some of the gold.
	   The leader of Germany's Jewish community, Ignatz Bubis, said the
conclusion could have been more strongly worded.
	   ``The people at the top, I think, all knew where the gold came
from,'' Bubis said. ``There was a conspiracy of silence.''
	   German television reported in December that the bank had bought
Reichsbank gold robbed from Jews.
	   Deutsche Bank said at that time it was unaware of the trading
and announced it had commissioned five historians from Israel,
Germany, the United States and Britain to research the origin of
gold it bought during World War II.
	   Separately, Deutsche Bank was named in a lawsuit filed June 3 in
New York on behalf of 10,000 Holocaust survivors and victims'
relatives. That lawsuit, still pending, alleges Deutsche Bank and
Dresdner Bank profited from the looting of gold and other personal
property from Jewish victims of the Holocaust.
	   The panel of five historians from Israel, Germany, the United
States and Britain conducted their research using the bank's own
microfilm records, the books of the defunct Reichsbank and files
from Degussa, which smelted the gold.
	   ``Gold played a deciding roll in financing the import of
strategic goods essential to the Nazi war efforts,'' the report
said.
	   ``The vast majority of the gold that Germany sold was stolen:
from central banks of vanquished countries, but also from
individuals, especially the victims of the Nazis' racist
persecution _ above all Jews.''
	   Given their connections and information available at the time,
Deutsche Bank officials ``could have known that the gold originally
belonged _ and ... still belongs _ to victims of Nazi Germany,''
the report concluded.
	   The report concludes that Deutsche Bank purchased 4,446
kilograms (4.9 tons) from the Nazi central bank during World War
II, and that at least 744 kilograms (1,637 pounds) of it stemmed
from Holocaust victims.
	   The 744 kilograms were linked through documents to gold looted
from Holocaust victims and collected by SS Capt. Bruno Melmer, the
historians said.
	   Trading most of the gold through its only overseas subsidiary,
in Istanbul, Turkey, the bank made a profit from 1941-43 of dlrs
378,000, or dlrs 3.4 million today. The historians said the profit
represented 0.15 percent of the bank's total profits during that
period.
	   Some of the gold, 323 kilograms (710 pounds), remained among
assets frozen into the 1950s in Switzerland at the request of the
Allies after the war, the report said.
	   That gold was sold in 1995. This March, the bank donated the
entire dlrs 3.1 million in proceeds to Jewish groups, saying it
suspected the gold may originally have been robbed from Jews.
	   Deutsche Bank released a brief statement Friday thanking the
historians for their work and saying the bank ``reaffirms its moral
responsibility for the darkest chapter in its history and deeply
regrets any injustices.''

U.N. committee urges Israel to cease interrogation methods
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PHILIP WALLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A U.N. panel of human rights experts on Friday
condemned Israel's interrogation techniques and urged it to respect
international human rights norms in the occupied territories.
	   The committee of 18 independent experts said discrimination
against Arabs, Bedouin people and women should be ended.
	   It said it remained concerned that prisoners can be kept in
custody for long periods without trial.
	   The committee's chairwoman, Christine Chanet, said condemnation
wasn't too strong a term to characterize the committee's opinion of
Israel's use of handcuffing, hooding, shaking and other physical
force in interrogating suspected terrorists. ``It's a violation of
the covenant,'' Chanet said. Israel has acknowledged it is using
such methods, but has said most are necessary to extract
information that could prevent attacks on Israelis by Palestinian
militants.
	   The committee was publishing the conclusions of its two-day
examination of Israel's first report on its implementation of the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which the
country ratified in 1991.
	   While containing four paragraphs of ``positive factors,'' the
document listed more than seven pages of concerns and
recommendations.
	   The committee acknowledged Israel's security concerns and
problems linked to its occupation of territories affected the
covenant's implementation.
	   Members welcomed the government's efforts to address questions
of police violence and to review complaints of alleged mistreatment
of civilians by members of the police and security forces.
	   But they expressed deep concern that Israel ``continues to deny
its responsibility'' to fully apply the covenant in the occupied
territories, which they define as the West Bank, Gaza Strip and
other areas where they say the Israelis exercise effective control.
	   The committee's report said it ``is concerned that Palestinians
in the occupied territories who remain under the control of Israeli
security forces don't enjoy the same rights and freedoms as Jewish
settlers.''
	   It urged Israel to take immediate steps to end discriminatory
practices.
	   The committee criticized the lack of information in Israel's
report about the human rights situation in the occupied
territories.
	   It expressed concern about Israeli security forces' use of
rubber-covered metal bullets to disperse demonstrations in the
occupied territories.
	   The committee requested information from Israel about the number
of people killed by the bullets, the number of complaints about
their use and the number of security personnel punished as a
result.
	   Israel contends that measures criticized by the panel are
required to maintain national security.
	   ``Agonizing dilemmas arise in trying to balance certain
provisions of the covenant with a government's primary
responsibility: to protect the lives of its citizens,'' the Israeli
mission to U.N. offices in Geneva said in a statement.
	   The Israeli statement said the covenant doesn't apply in the
occupied territories because the Palestinian Authority has assumed
responsibility for more than 95 percent of Palestinians there.
	   Where Israel is responsible, ``it applies the relevant
principles of humanitarian law,'' the statement said.

In old-style campaign, Lukashenko urges Belarusians to harvest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Combining communist-style appeals to
workers with promises of new cars and refrigerators, Belarusian
President Alexander Lukashenko went live on state television and
radio on Friday to exhort his compatriots to bring in the summer
harvest.
	   Lukashenko told his Cabinet during a two-hour meeting, broadcast
live on state media, that the basis of ``our independence ... has
always been and always will be bread, the village.''
	   ``Agriculture makes up a big sector of our economy, some 40
percent. If we lose August, we'll lose a big part of our economy,''
he said.
	   Official media have reported that only one-quarter of the
country's grain has been harvested so far.
	   Lukashenko declared that as of Monday, the country would be put
on a special footing, with top officials exercising ``tight
control'' and reporting results of the campaign to him daily.
	   ``That means, in plain folk language, that everything alive,
everything that moves or is capable of moving, must be directed
toward the grain harvest,'' he said.
	   The state will buy 2 million tons of grain from state and
collective farms and farmers, Lukashenko said.
	   If that's not incentive enough, a state competition announced
Friday might help. According to a decree by the Council of
Ministers, Belarus' biggest reapers will win financial bonuses,
televisions, refrigerators, motorcycles, watches and automobiles.

Franco-German match to raise money for policeman hurt by hooligans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France and Germany will play each other in a match
to raise money for the family of a French gendarme seriously
injured by German hooligans during the World Cup, organizers said
Friday.
	   The match the evening of Sept. 20 in the German town of Kiel,
across the border from Strasbourg, will pit former members of the
two countries' international teams, said a statement by the French
Soccer Federation.
	   Proceeds from ticket sales were to go to the family of Daniel
Nivel, who was beaten into a coma by German toughs outside a
stadium in the northern French city of Lens when Germany played
Yugoslavia on June 21. At last word, Nivel remained in a coma.
	   With the slogan ``Yes to soccer without violence,'' the match
was being organized by both the French and German national soccer
federations.

Notorious Hells Angel released
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ The most notorious of Denmark's Hells
Angels has been released from prison for killing a rival and the
outlaw biker gang has invited all of Copenhagen to a party to
celebrate his freedom.
	   Police in the Danish capital said they had no special plans for
monitoring the Saturday party, despite memories of the violence in
the now-dormant Nordic biker war.
	   Joern Nielsen was released after completing his 12-year sentence
for shooting to death the leader of a rival gang. His sentence
marked the end of a biker feud that killed 13 people in the 1980s.
	   Another feud, between the Hells Angels and Bandidos, erupted in
1994 in Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Norway, leaving 12 dead and
some 70 injured before ending in a truce last year.
	   During the second feud, Nielsen was attacked by assailants who
entered his minimum-security prison and fired 25 shots and grenade
at his cell.
	   The bloodiest attack of the later feud was in October 1996, when
an anti-tank grenade was fired into the Hells Angels' Copenhagen
compound during a party, killing two people and injuring 19.

U.N. committee urges Israel to cease interrogation methods
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PHILIP WALLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A U.N. panel of human rights experts condemned
Israel's interrogation techniques Friday and urged it to respect
international human rights norms in the occupied territories.
	   The committee of 18 independent experts said discrimination
against Arabs, Bedouin people and women should end.
	   It said it remained concerned that prisoners can be kept in
custody for long periods without trial.
	   The committee's chairwoman, Christine Chanet, said condemnation
wasn't too strong a term to characterize the committee's opinion of
Israel's use of handcuffing, hooding, shaking and other physical
force in interrogating suspected terrorists. ``It's a violation of
the covenant,'' Chanet said.
	   Israel has acknowledged using such methods, but has said most
are necessary to extract information that could prevent attacks on
Israelis by Palestinian militants.
	   The committee was publishing the conclusions of its two-day
examination of Israel's first report on its implementation of the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which the
country ratified in 1991.
	   While containing four paragraphs of ``positive factors,'' the
document includes more than seven pages of concerns and
recommendations.
	   The committee acknowledged that Israel's security concerns and
problems linked to its occupation of territories affect the
covenant's implementation.
	   Members welcomed the government's efforts to address questions
of police violence and to review complaints of alleged mistreatment
of civilians by members of the police and security forces.
	   But they expressed deep concern that Israel ``continues to deny
its responsibility'' to fully apply the covenant in the occupied
territories, which they define as the West Bank, Gaza Strip and
other areas where they say the Israelis exercise effective control.
	   The committee's report said it ``is concerned that Palestinians
in the occupied territories who remain under the control of Israeli
security forces don't enjoy the same rights and freedoms as Jewish
settlers.''
	   It urged Israel to take immediate steps to end discriminatory
practices.
	   The committee criticized the lack of information in Israel's
report about the human rights situation in the occupied
territories, and expressed concern about Israeli security forces'
use of rubber-covered metal bullets to disperse demonstrations in
the territories.
	   The committee requested information from Israel about the number
of people killed by the bullets, the number of complaints about
their use and the number of security personnel punished as a
result.
	   ``Agonizing dilemmas arise in trying to balance certain
provisions of the covenant with a government's primary
responsibility: to protect the lives of its citizens,'' the Israeli
mission to U.N. offices in Geneva said in a statement.
	   The Israeli statement said the covenant doesn't apply in the
occupied territories because the Palestinian Authority has assumed
responsibility for more than 95 percent of Palestinians there.
	   Where Israel is responsible, ``it applies the relevant
principles of humanitarian law,'' the statement said.

U.S., Lithuania, Yugoslavia roll; Nigerian tests positive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.S., Russia wins. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Jason Sasser led a balanced offense with
17 points as the United States rebounded from its first loss since
1990 at a major tournament and routed South Korea 88-62 Friday to
reach the second round at the World Basketball Championship.
	   Lithuania, which struggled one day after its upset of the
Americans, and Yugoslavia both won Friday to stay unbeaten, while
Russia also advanced with a victory.
	   Off the courts, FIBA announced that Nigerian center Julius Nwosu
was suspended from the championship after testing positive for the
banned substance ephedrine. Nwosu, who had a brief pro career in
the NBA and CBA, was tested after Nigeria's loss to Spain
Wednesday, the opening day of the tournament.
	   The mostly anonymous U.S. team (2-1), drawn largely from the CBA
and European leagues, started slowly against South Korea and led
44-34 at halftime.
	   With South Korea content to launch one 3-point shot after
another _ the team shot 12-for-36 from behind the arc, 10 more
attempts than from inside _ the non-Dream Teamers managed to pull
away in the second half.
	   The United States held a 46-24 rebounding edge and were much
more aggressive than in Thursday's 84-82 loss to Lithuania. Former
Syracuse star Wendell Alexis chipped in with 13 points, as did
Jimmy King of Michigan Fab Five fame.
	   ``That game yesterday got away from us. We knew it was South
Korea today and maybe they're not the strongest team,'' said Jimmy
Oliver, who had 11 points, ``but we didn't want to let this one
go.''
	   The Americans finish second in Group C, behind Lithuania and
ahead of Brazil.
	   Lithuania trailed by as many as 14 points in the first half
against Brazil (1-2) but rallied late to win 66-62. Seton Hall
product Arturas Karnisovas poured in 20 points, Saulius Sombergas
added 18, and Darius Lukminas hit two key 3-pointer down the
stretch.
	   ``We won today so I can't say we're tired mentally. But playing
like we did yesterday and then staying up until 3:00 in the morning
to watch the game on television tired us physically,'' Lithuanian
coach Jonas Kazlauskas said. ``We spent a lot of emotion.''
	   His country, which won the bronze at the last two Olympics, will
play either Australia or Nigeria when action resumes Sunday with
the second round. The United States will play either Argentina or
Spain.
	   The top three from each group advance to the round-robin second
round, forming two new six-team brackets. Four countries from each
will move on to the quarterfinals.
	   European champion Yugoslavia clinched Group B by routing winless
Japan 99-54 as Sasha Obradovic and Dragan Lukovsi had 18 points
apiece. The 1990 world titlists hit 14-of-22 shots from behind the
3-point line.
	   Russia (2-1) finished second in the group by defeating Puerto
Rico 86-73 behind Vassily Karassev's 17 points.
	   Puerto Rico (1-2) led 54-45 with 15:21 left in the game, but
scored just one field goal over the final seven minutes and Russia
used a 15-2 run to take the lead for good.
	   Veteran center Jose Ortiz led Puerto Rico with 18 points and 15
rebounds before fouling out.

Allen Johnson takes on strong field in hurdles, Wariso out of
</HEADLINE>
showdown with Black &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SHEFFIELD, England (AP) _ World and Olympic 110m hurdles
champion Allen Johnson takes on world record holder Colin Jackson
and Goodwill Games titlist Mark Crear at the British Grand Prix
Sunday.
	   To make it even more competitive, the field also includes the
world's fastest this year, Reggie Torian.
	   The American newcomer clocked 13.03 to win the title at the U.S.
Championship at New Orleans last month with Crear second in 13.06.
	   Jackson, whose world record of 12.91 is five years old now, also
has been flying this season although he finished fourth behind his
three main rivals at the Goodwill Games last week.
	   Johnson, who has run 13.12, has been beaten three times by Crear
this season, the last time being on Wednesday in Paris, where his
rival won in 13.11 and Torian was second in 13.24. Johnson placed
third in 13.27 and will be looking for a better performance at
Sheffield.
	   Another highlight of Sunday's meet will be an attempt on the
women's mile record by double Olympic champion Svetlana Masterkova
of Russia, who won the 800 and 1,500 meter titles at Atlanta.
	   Javelin world champion Marius Corbett of South Africa goes
against Goodwill Games winner Sergei Makarov of Russia and former
world record holder Steve Backley, who threw 89.89 two weeks ago.
	   Jonathan Edwards, triple jump world record holder who flopped at
both the Olympics and world championship, is back to form and has
leaped over 18 meters this season
	   World champion Cathy Freeman has pulled out of the women's 400
meters because of a lingering foot injury the Australian sustained
in Oslo and the men's event won't have the showdown between Roger
Black and Solomon Wariso, who edged his countryman for a place on
Britain's European Championship team.
	   Black, silver medalist behind Michael Johnson at the Olympics in
Atlanta, announced his retirement after being dropped from the team
and said Sunday's race would be his last.
	   What would have been a chance to show the selectors they were
wrong won't now happen because Wariso has withdrawn because of the
knee injury he ironically suffered in beating Black to the line at
the British championship.
	   Wariso injured his knee diving for the line to beat Black at
Alexander stadium Birmingham.

Author Arthur Hailey among victims of dinner party robbery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ The dinner party robbery might have been
a scene out of an Arthur Hailey novel _ except that Hailey himself
was one of the victims and the gun was definitely real.
	   The Nassau Tribune reported Thursday that Hailey and his wife,
Sheila, were robbed Wednesday night by two intruders. Nobody was
injured.
	   ``We'd just finished dinner, the six of us _ Lester and Anne
Smith, our hosts, Baroness dePosson, Michael Withers and ourselves
_ when two masked bandits brandishing handguns and knives walked
into the room with Catherine, the Smiths' youngest daughter,'' said
Hailey.
	   At first they thought it was a prank, but Catherine's ashen face
convinced them it was real, Hailey said.
	   ``When you're looking down the barrel of a gun you know you
don't fool around,'' said Hailey, who is 78 and had open-heart
surgery last year.
	   The robbers were completely covered by clothing and wore gloves,
but Hailey said he thought one of them was a woman. They took
jewelry and possibly some cash and fled in the Smiths' car, which
was later recovered by police.
	   Hailey's latest novel, ``Detective,'' is on several bestseller
charts. His best-known work may be ``Roots,'' his account of his
search for his family's history, from Africa to the United States.

American Julich looks toward podium; one more team quits

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AUTUN, France (AP) _ Safely in second place as the Tour de
France arrived Friday in the wine country of Burgundy, Bobby Julich
was thinking ahead to another appealing locale: the winner's podium
on the Champs-Elysees.
	   That's where the American plans to be standing on Sunday, when
the scandal-plagued tour, which lost another team Friday, staggers
into Paris for its not-so-grand finale.
	   Hopefully, Julich says, he'll be on the podium's second step _
one above last year's winner, Jan Ullrich, now in third.
	   ``Those 14 seconds are very, very important,'' Julich said of
the gap between him and Ullrich after Friday's 19th stage. ``I
expect a big battle for second.''
	   And as for catching Marco Pantani, the current leader by a huge
five minutes and 42 seconds?
	   ``That's a dream,'' said Julich, of Glenwood Springs, Colorado,
who rides for the Cofidis team. ``It would be very difficult to
overcome that deficit.
	   ``I'll try, though.''
	   The standings of the top three didn't change Friday, as the
riders ended a brief trip into Switzerland for a fast 242-kilometer
(151.3-mile) ride to Autun, in Burgundy.
	   After an early breakaway by 13 riders, Sweden's Magnus Backstedt
won the stage in a final sprint. Maarten Den Bakker of the
Netherlands came in second, and Italy's Eddy Mazzoleni was third.
	   But there was still no respite from the doping scandal that has
enveloped the Tour. The latest to withdraw was the Dutch team TVM,
one of two teams at the very center of the scandal.
	   ``They are neither physically nor mentally capable of finishing
this Tour de France,'' said Tour director Jean-Marie Leblanc,
reading a team statement.
	   Only 14 of the original 21 teams are still in the race. Six have
pulled out in anger at police tactics, and one, Festina, was
expelled on July 17 after its officials admitted to systematic
doping.
	   It was the police treatment of the TVM team Tuesday night that
sparked the riders' unprecedented protest the following day,
leading to the annulment of the 17th stage.
	   The TVM riders were taken to the hospital and given lengthy
medical examinations, including blood, urine and hair tests.
	   Team masseur Jann Moors, now in custody, will be questioned
Friday by an investigating judge in the city of Lille.
	   The defending champion, Ullrich, had harsh words Friday for some
of his fellow riders _ and also the French justice system.
	   ``What I'm feeling I can't really describe,'' Ullrich wrote in a
column for the German daily newspaper Bild. ``I'm both unbelievably
angry and deeply disappointed. A great race has been stolen from
all of us.
	   He said he was angry ``at Festina, at the justice (system), and
also at pros like (Laurent) Jalabert and Luc Leblanc. They failed
at the Tour and now they're stirring up trouble prematurely.''
	   But most riders weren't talking about the scandal on Friday _
they were thinking ahead.
	   The crucial day is Saturday, with a time trial at Le Creusot. In
the last time trial of the Tour, Ullrich beat Pantani 4:21.
	   ``Nothing is won yet,'' said Pantani. ``I need to stay
concentrated.
	   ``One can never be too tranquil, because at the last minute you
can always have a flat tire.''

Second arrest in fatal van crash with refugees in Germany
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS four grafs with background on smuggling arrests in
another German state. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DRESDEN, Germany (AP) _ A Czech man who escaped after crashing a
van full of Kosovo Albanian refugees into a wall, killing seven,
has been arrested, police said Friday.
	   An 18-year-old Czech from Most in northern Bohemia, identified
as Marek H., confessed to having been the driver of the van, after
police arrested him near the Czech border in the eastern state of
Saxony Thursday night, hours after the accident.
	   He was charged Friday with various crimes including negligent
homicide and smuggling illegal aliens into Germany.
	   German border guards say he ran a roadblock early Thursday then
crashed into a stone wall while speeding around a curve. Six
refugees were killed in the crush and another died later in a
hospital. Twenty others were injured, some critically.
	   Another Czech man in the van was also injured; he was arrested
at the scene.
	   Police say identification of the Kosovo Albanians has been
difficult because only one was carrying papers.
	   But they said the smuggling operation was apparently well
organized, because after the crash calls came in to police from
around Germany and Norway asking by name about people who were
supposed to be on the van.
	   Germany has sought to crack down on illegal immigration from
non-European Union neighbors to the east even as it loosens its
borders with EU countries.
	   Police in the southern state of Bavaria, which also shares a
border with the Czech Republic, have been investigating a large
smuggling ring since late last year.
	   Bavarian police said Friday they had arrested 45 suspects since
April, most of them Czechs, who allegedly smuggled in more than
1,000 refugees, many from the Balkan region.
	   The suspects, who allegedly charged refugees up to dlrs 3,000
each for transit into Germany, are expected to be charged and tried
in Germany, police said.

	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ Artillery and mortars rained across the
disputed frontier of Kashmir, killing scores of Indian and
Pakistani civilians and soldiers, officials said Friday, as
diplomatic efforts broke down to revive negotiations on the
50-year-old territorial dispute.
	   Officials said 52 people were killed on both sides in one of the
heaviest exchanges of fire in years along the frontier, known as
the Line of Control.
	   India said Pakistani mortars slammed into a military hospital,
killing 16 civilians in the town of Tangdhar, some 200 meters
(yards) from the mountainous frontier and about 150 kilometers (90
miles) northwest of the provincial capital, Srinagar. The operating
theater and other areas of the field hospital were badly damaged,
said military officials in Jammu, the winter capital of Kashmir.
The officials cannot be identified under military briefing rules.
	   Pakistan said a total of 26 civilians _ including a 6-year-old
girl _ and four soldiers died from firing Thursday. Some 100
people, mostly civilians, were wounded.
	   India said its death toll was 22, including the dead at the
hospital. Seven security forces personnel were also wounded.
	   Police said at least 20,000 villagers living along the frontier
fled their homes to escape the shelling. Authorities were trying to
arrange temporary shelters for them.
	   Gul Mohammad Khan, a villager from Rampur, 75 kilometers (45
miles) north of Srinagar said he had been forced to flee his
village because of the firing.
	   ``There was heavy shelling on our village. It is a warlike
situation,'' said Khan who is living with relatives in a safer
area.
	   Khan said regular bus services had been disrupted and private
vehicles were not allowed to move in areas near the border.
	   The latest round of firing has been going on for four days in
India's Kupwara district, opposite Pakistan's Muzzafarabad region,
said an Indian spokesman.
	   Exchanges of mortar and gun fire is almost a daily occurrence,
but casualties of this magnitude are rare. Last September, at least
39 people died in a similar outbreak of border tension.
	   The Himalayan region, wracked by three wars since both nations
became independence 50 years ago, is divided between them by a
400-kilometer (250-mile) line of control that is monitored by the
United Nations.
	   The firing coincided with a regional summit in Colombo, Sri
Lanka, where the Indian and Pakistani prime ministers met for the
first time since the two countries conducted nuclear tests in May.
	   After agreeing in an initial meeting Wednesday to revive a
dialogue on Kashmir and other issues, talks failed between the
senior bureaucrats to find an agreed procedure for conducting the
negotiations. It was the same issue that scuttled the talks last
year.

Israeli-allied militiaman killed in roadside bomb
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ A roadside bomb exploded in southern
Lebanon Friday, killing a pro-Israeli militiaman and injuring his
seven-year old sister, Lebanese security officials said.
	   The bomb, apparently detonated by remote control, went off on a
road outside the town of Jezzine in the Israeli-occupied zone,
officials said on condition of anonymity.
	   Nabil Iskandar, a member of the South Lebanon Army, was killed
instantly while at the wheel of his pickup truck, the officials
said.
	   His 12-year-old sister Salam, who was sitting next to him, was
wounded, the officials added. She is being treated at a nearby
hospital.
	   Jezzine is 20 kilometers (13 miles) north of Marjayoun, the
biggest town in the occupied sector, and is run by the
Israeli-backed SLA, which patrols the zone with Israeli soldiers.
Israel set up the zone in 1985 to protect its northern territory
from guerrilla attacks.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but the attack
bore the hallmarks of the Hezbollah movement, whose guerrillas have
frequently used roadside bombs against Israeli soldiers and SLA
militiamen.
	   On Thursday, one Israeli soldier was killed and five others
wounded in a Hezbollah ambush in south Lebanon.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah is fighting to oust the 1,500
Israeli troops and 2,500 SLA militiamen from the zone.

Tropical storm strengethens off Mexico's Pacific coast
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES tropical storm Alex's position, trajectory. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A tropical storm that formed off of Mexico's
Pacific coast is expected to become a hurricane but was heading
west and away from land, the U.S. National Hurricane Center
reported.
	   Tropical storm Estelle was over 300 miles (483 kilometers) south
of Manzanillo, Mexico at 11:00 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT), with sustained
winds of nearly 70 mph (113 kph). It was heading west at about 9
mph (14 kph).
	   Hurricanes have minimum sustained wind speeds of 74 mph (119
kph).
	   Forecasters said it Estelle would probably grow to hurricane
force by Friday, but early predictions of the track indicated it
was unlikely to hit land.
	   Meanwhile, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Miami
said Friday that tropical Storm Alex poses an increasing threat to
Puerto Rico and other Caribbean islands but is weakening.
	   The storm doesn't have a chance to develop in the short term as
it advances with 50 mph (80 kph) winds toward the northeastern
Caribbean Sea, center director Jerry Jarrell said Friday.
	   ``(So) it's a little bit of a threat to Puerto Rico and the
Virgin Islands ... with a weaker storm,'' he said.
	   At 1500 GMT Friday, Alex was located near 15.5 north latitude,
49.5 west longitude, or about 725 miles (1,166 kilometers) east of
the Leeward Islands in the eastern Caribbean.
	   The storm is expected to continue moving west near 12 mph (19
kph) with top sustained winds of about 50 mph (80 kph), but
forecasters said it could begin a gradual turn to the
west-northwest.

Bardot asks Austrians to boycott bull-slaughtering performance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MELISSA EDDY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Animal rights activist Brigitte Bardot
appealed to Austrians on Friday to boycott Viennese artist Hermann
Nitsch's six-day art extravaganza which will include slaughtering
three bulls on stage.
	   The former film star called on Austrian authorities and members
of the European Union to denounce the performance, which was to
begin Monday at Nitsch's castle in Prinzendorf, about 50 miles (30
miles) north of Vienna.
	   She also contacted a leading Austrian media lawyer to file an
injunction to stop the performance for ``pushing the limits of
art.''
	   ``I call on the Austrian people to boycott the murders of Mr.
Nitsch,'' Bardot said.
	   During the performance, which represents the culmination of
Nitsch's life work, three bulls are to be slaughtered by
professional butchers under the watchful eye of licensed
veterinarians.
	   Nitsch is widely known in his native Austria, both for his
paintings and his often-controversial performances on stage,
occasionally involving naked women and crucifixes. His paintings
hang in some of the world's premier museums, including the
Guggenheim and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the
Tate Gallery in London.
	   While Bardot acknowledged that animals are slaughtered around
the world each day, she argued that making a public spectacle of
``killing and watching them suffer'' was ``morbid.''
	   ``I have never heard of a performance where animals are murdered
and where people pay to rejoice in the suffering of animals,'' she
said. ``Have you ever been to a slaughterhouse as a spectator?''
	   The coming marathon performance is not the first time Nitsch,
whose art has been controversial since the 1960s, has used animals.
Previous performances have included actors covered in animal
entrails and the mixing of entrails with grapes.
	   Those who want to attend all six days of the upcoming
performance must pay 7,000 Austrian schillings (dlrs 580). For one
day, the admission drops to 3,000 schillings (dlrs 250).
	   Bardot said she had never heard of the 60-year-old Austrian
artist until Thursday, when she learned of the planned performance.
She immediately launched her appeal.

Romanians suspected of breaking UN embargo to Iraq

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with prosecutors' indictement

<TEXT>
	   CONSTANTA, Romania (AP) _ Two Romanians were indicted Friday for
allegedly supplying an American company with a ship which tried to
break the U.N. embargo against Iraq.
	   Calin Marinescu, general manager of a shipping agent company,
leased a state-owned vessel to Greek shippers in January. They in
turn leased it to an American-registered company, identified as
Tafeul Foods Impex.
	   Marinescu and two Romanians, one of whom was on the ``Opal''
when it sailed to the Gulf, were taken into custody late Thursday.
	   Prosecutors indicted Marinescu Friday of ``instigating
smuggling.'' The ship's captain Paul Petrache was indicted with
forgery and smuggling. The other Romanian was released.
	   The ship was apprehended in the Gulf in January by the
American-led, multinational naval force which patrols the area to
enforce the embargo.
	   Its cargo of Iraqi oil was confiscated and the ship released. It
is currently moored in Kuwait.
	   The U.N. Security Council imposed a trade embargo on Iraq in
1990 after President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, triggering the
Gulf War.
	   After U.S.-led troops drove the Iraqis from Kuwait, the council
decided to maintain the embargo until it was satisfied that Iraq
had destroyed all weapons of mass destruction.

Israeli-allied militiaman killed in roadside bomb

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ A roadside bomb exploded in southern
Lebanon Friday, killing a pro-Israeli militiaman and injuring his
12-year old sister, Lebanese security officials said.
	   The bomb, apparently detonated by remote control, went off on a
road outside the town of Jezzine in the Israeli-occupied zone,
officials said on condition of anonymity.
	   Nabil Iskandar, a member of the South Lebanon Army, was killed
instantly while at the wheel of his pickup truck, the officials
said.
	   His sister, Salam, who was sitting next to him, was wounded, the
officials added. She is being treated at a nearby hospital.
	   Jezzine is 20 kilometers (13 miles) north of Marjayoun, the
biggest town in the occupied sector, and is run by the
Israeli-backed SLA, which patrols the zone with Israeli soldiers.
Israel set up the zone in 1985 to protect its northern territory
from guerrilla attacks.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but the attack
bore the hallmarks of the Hezbollah movement, whose guerrillas have
frequently used roadside bombs against Israeli soldiers and SLA
militiamen.
	   On Thursday, one Israeli soldier was killed and five others
wounded in a Hezbollah ambush in south Lebanon.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah is fighting to oust the 1,500
Israeli troops and 2,500 SLA militiamen from the zone.

Third case of cholera reported in Moscow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A third case of cholera has been reported in
Moscow this year, a news agency reported Friday.
	   The victim was a 67-year-old woman who was hospitalized on
Tuesday, ITAR-Tass said, quoting the Moscow Sanitary Surveillance
Committee.
	   The Interfax news agency said the woman died. The report could
not be confirmed. Interfax said the woman was already in a coma
when she was hospitalized, and also suffered from diabetes, kidney
problems and other ailments.
	   Fifty-five relatives who came in contact with the woman have
been checked, Interfax said.
	   Cholera is an infectious, intestinal disease caused by bacteria.
Symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, cramps and collapse.

	   ----
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Military officials from the world's
Portuguese-speaking countries met Friday in Cape Verde to discuss
the possible deployment of a peace-keeping force in Guinea-Bissau,
the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
	   Last week a delegation from the Community of Portuguese Speaking
Countries, or CPLP, brokered a cease-fire in Guinea-Bissau, the
tiny west African country submerged in conflict since a June 7 coup
attempt.
	   During talks, both Guinea-Bissau President Joao Bernardo
Vieira's government and the breakaway military faction showed
interest in a peacekeeping force.
	   Cape Verde's armed forces chief of staff, Amilcar Baptista, said
the CPLP military meeting would be the ``first step'' towards the
idea, Lusa reported.
	   The rebels seized the capital's main military garrison and
airport two months ago, after Brig. Gen. Ansumane Mane was
dismissed as head of the armed forces for allegedly running guns to
Senegal's Casamance separatists.
	   No numbers were available on how many have been killed in the
fighting, which has spread to inland areas of the small country
wedged between Senegal and Guinea.
	   The CPLP comprises Portugal, Brazil, Angola, Mozambique, Cape
Verde, and Sao Tome and Principe.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's new military ruler has announced
oil sector reforms aimed at eliminating corruption by government
officials and middlemen selling the country's lucrative crude
reserves.
	   In a statement issued late Thursday, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar
said oil sales would be restricted to recognized international
firms, buyers holding term contracts and winners of monthly
competitive bids.
	   The new guidelines will be used to help eliminate corruption and
ensure the Nigerian government retains ``maximum'' revenue from oil
sales, the statement said.
	   Last month, Abubakar announced that only large international
firms based in Nigeria would be allowed to import refined products
for the junta, ending the alleged practice by the late Gen. Sani
Abacha of granting contracts to his friends and relatives.
	   Abubakar came to power in early June, after the death of Abacha,
whose five-year rule left Nigeria scarred and isolated. Corruption,
neglect and incompetence crippled Nigeria's economy and
infrastructure, while an abysmal human rights record made it a
diplomatic pariah.
	   ___
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Misuse of special low-capacity
electricity meters for some Ivorian households is costing the state
more than dlrs 15 million in lost revenue annually, a newspaper
reported Friday.
	   Quoting the Ivorian energy ministry, the government-backed
Fraternite-Matin newspaper reported that the illegal use of the
meters _ designed to provide an inexpensive source of electricity
to low-income households _ was on the increase, especially among
higher-income families which can afford to pay regular rates.
	   The Ivorian government sanctioned the low-capacity meters in
1990 to subsidize electricity in rural areas.
	   The special meters can be purchased on the black market, the
Energy Ministry report said, and are used by about a quarter of all
Ivorian households.
	   The loss in funds could seriously compromise government plans to
extend electric lines into the countryside, the newspaper reported.
	   ___
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Hundreds of women marched through downtown
Nairobi on Friday to mark the start of a U.N. campaign to combat
violence against women in Africa.
	   ``Violence against women and girls is the most pervasive
violation of the universal human rights principles,'' said Paul
Chuke, the campaign's resident coordinator.
	   In Africa, Chuke said, increased poverty, political and
religious conflict and cultural practices such as female
circumcision add to the violence.
	   The Africa-wide campaign is coordinated by U.N. Fund for Women,
UNIFEM, which provides financial and technical support to programs
that promote human rights for women.
	   Marere Wamwachai, a Kenyan legislator and assistant minister of
home affairs, national heritage and social services, told the
gathering that women face violence in their daily lives that is far
above that faced by men.
	   ``It is important during this campaign that we break the silence
and say no to violence against women and girls,'' Wamwachai said.
	   The U.N campaign being launched simultaneously in all African
countries coincides with Pan-African Women's Day, which honors the
contribution of women to development in Africa.
	   ___
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ A 37 percent hike in electricity rates
was announced Thursday in Zimbabwe.
	   The increase adds new strain to an economy that has seen
inflation of more than 30 percent, high unemployment and a falling
Zimbabwe dollar.
	   Electricity costs jumped to compensate for a 40 percent fall in
the value of the Zimbabwe dollar that must buy nearly half of the
country's power from neighboring countries.
	   The price hike is expected to boost prices of all products and
to particularly hurt the mining industry, where 18 percent of costs
is eaten by electric power.
	   ``It's not something we can cut down on,'' said Doug Verden,
chief executive of the Zimbabwe Chamber of Mines.
	   Consumers continue to pay steady rates for imported fuel under
price controls levied by President Robert Mugabe's government.
	   The only black leader since the former British colony of
Rhodesia became independent in 1980, Mugabe faces a serious threat
to his government from unrest over deteriorating economic
conditions and government corruption.
	   ___
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Entry-level diamond miners
will receive 1,800 rand (dlrs 295) a month, according to an
agreement between De Beers consolidated mines and the National
Union of Mineworkers.
	   The wages represent an 8 percent increase that will also apply
to higher salaries, according to Thursday's announcement.
	   The agreement affects about 5,300 employees.
	   South African inflation was more than 6 percent over the past
year.
	   Last year, entry-level coal miners received a 23 percent
increase for a base pay of 900 rand (dlrs 147) a month.
	   By comparison, a liter of milk costs 3.19 rand (dlrs 0.52),
bread costs 2.80 rand (dlrs 0.45).

Israeli-allied militiaman killed in roadside bomb in Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ A roadside bomb exploded in southern
Lebanon on Friday, killing a pro-Israeli militiaman and wounding
his 12-year-old sister, Lebanese security officials said.
	   The bomb, apparently detonated by remote control, went off on a
road outside the town of Jezzine in the Israeli-occupied zone,
officials said on condition of anonymity.
	   Nabil Iskandar, a member of the South Lebanon Army, was killed
instantly while at the wheel of his pickup truck, the officials
said.
	   His sister, Salam, who was sitting next to him, was wounded, the
officials added. She was taken to a hospital.
	   Jezzine is 20 kilometers (13 miles) north of Marjayoun, the
biggest town in the occupied sector, and is run by the
Israeli-backed SLA, which patrols the zone with Israeli soldiers.
Israel set up the zone in 1985 to protect its northern territory
from guerrilla attacks.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but the attack
bore the hallmarks of the Hezbollah movement, whose guerrillas have
frequently used roadside bombs against Israeli soldiers and SLA
militiamen.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah is fighting to oust the 1,500
Israeli troops and 2,500 SLA militiamen from the zone.

Three youths confess to vandalizing statue near Buchenwald
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WEIMAR, Germany (AP) _ Three youths confessed to vandalizing a
bronze statue of liberated prisoners at the former Buchenwald
concentration camp in eastern Germany, prosecutors said Friday.
	   The youths, aged 17 to 19, said they had been drinking and that
they used a metal saw to cut into the 3.5-meter-high (12-foot-high)
last week, prosecutor Raimund Sauter said.
	   Sauter said the motive did was not political, but that the
youths appeared to have a ``certain sympathy'' for Germany's
neo-Nazi scene. The youths, who were not identified, were released
pending possible criminal charges.
	   Earlier this week, officials at the museum near Weimar found saw
marks on the figure of a child among 11 just-liberated prisoners
depicted in the 1958 statue by Fritz Cremer.
	   From 1937 to 1945, Nazis imprisoned about 263,000 people at
Buchenwald. The prisoners came from more than 30 countries and
included Jews, Gypsies, communists and others who resisted Nazi
rule. Some 56,000 people died there, including at least 11,000
Jews.

Author Arthur Hailey among victims of dinner party robbery
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS final graf to REMOVE INCORRECT reference to Hailey as
author of ``Roots.'' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ The dinner party robbery might have been
a scene out of an Arthur Hailey novel _ except that Hailey himself
was one of the victims and the gun was definitely real.
	   The Nassau Tribune reported Thursday that Hailey and his wife,
Sheila, were robbed Wednesday night by two intruders. Nobody was
injured.
	   ``We'd just finished dinner, the six of us _ Lester and Anne
Smith, our hosts, Baroness dePosson, Michael Withers and ourselves
_ when two masked bandits brandishing handguns and knives walked
into the room with Catherine, the Smiths' youngest daughter,'' said
Hailey.
	   At first they thought it was a prank, but Catherine's ashen face
convinced them it was real, Hailey said.
	   ``When you're looking down the barrel of a gun you know you
don't fool around,'' said Hailey, who is 78 and had open-heart
surgery last year.
	   The robbers were completely covered by clothing and wore gloves,
but Hailey said he thought one of them was a woman. They took
jewelry and possibly some cash and fled in the Smiths' car, which
was later recovered by police.
	   Hailey's latest novel, ``Detective,'' is on several bestseller
charts.

U.S. presses Milosevic to allow aid flow into Kosovo

 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with KLA statement on Albanian
television &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic gave his personal assurance Friday that relief workers
can deliver aid to thousands of Kosovo Albanians who fled into the
hills to escape a major government offensive, a U.S. envoy said.
	   The envoy, Christopher Hill, told reporters that Milosevic
promised he would take ``personal responsibility'' for allowing aid
workers access to refugees.
	   Hill said the Yugoslav president also agreed to allow
international monitors to escort the civilians back home to avoid
intimidation by local authorities.
	   Hill arrived here in the Kosovo provincial capital Friday
following a two-hour meeting with Milosevic in Belgrade. Hill said
Milosevic repeated his promise _ made to European Union delegation
Thursday _ that the week-long Serb offensive against the Kosovo
Liberation Army was over.
	   Serb forces drove the KLA from several key strongholds during
the operation.
	   Despite the pledge, scattered clashes were reported by both Serb
and ethnic Albanian sources Friday. The government's Tanjug news
agency said eight ethnic Albanian ``terrorists'' were killed and
several were arrested Friday when they attacked Serb police near
Lipljane, some 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of Pristina.
	   Three Serb policemen were seriously wounded, the report said.
	   In a statement broadcast Friday by Albanian state television,
KLA spokesman Jakup Krasniqi expressed disappointment that the
world had not reacted more strongly to the Serb offensive.
	   ``The Kosovo Liberation Army will be more strong and more
professional than it is now,'' Krasniqi said. ``The Serbian
offensive can never bring the KLA to its knees. We will fight the
Serbian vandals until our victory so long as we have breath.''

Clavet advances as rain delays Generali Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KITZBUEHEL, Austria (AP) _ Spain's Francisco Clavet and Italy's
Andrea Gaudenzi won quarterfinal matches Friday as heavy rain and
wind slowed play at the Generali Open.
	   Clavet rolled past Brazil's Fernando Meligeni, 6-3, 6-1, and
will face Gaudenzi in Saturday's semifinals at the dlrs 535,000
event.
	   Gaudenzi advanced with a 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) victory over Ecuador
player Nicolas Lapentti, who stunned second-seeded Yevgeny
Kafelnikov in straight sets Thursday.
	   Clavet, seeded sixth, has yielded just 15 games in his three
matches and become a favorite to win his first title since Bogota
last year.
	   ``I can't say I'll win, but I'm playing very good tennis,'' said
the Spaniard, 29. ``I hardly made any unforced errors today.''
	   Clavet dominated the match against Meligeni, who reached the
round of 16 at the French Open, although strong wind affected his
baseline game.
	   Top-seeded Marcelo Rios pulled out with an injury while the rest
of the top five seeds have been beaten except No. 3 Albert Costa of
Spain.
	   Downpours stopped play between Costa and defending champion
Filip DeWulf of Belgium, with DeWulf up, 6-2, 2-3.
	   Bad weather and darkness will also likely force the delay until
Saturday of the final quarterfinal matchup with Australia's
eighth-seeded Richard Fromberg pitted against Argentinian Franco
Squillari.

Rwanda prepares for first post-genocide elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Rwanda is preparing to hold its first
post-genocide local elections next month, a member of the country's
leading political movement said Friday.
	   The elections to choose local councils will be conducted among
groups of 10 households _ the smallest unit of social organization
in the tiny central African nation.
	   Voting will take place simultaneously throughout the country and
is aimed at decentralizing the decision-making process and giving
people the power of the vote, said Charles Muligande,
secretary-general of the Rwandan Patriotic Front.
	   ``Everything is being done in order to have elections this year,
probably in August,'' said the former professor of statistics at
Howard University in Washington, D.C.
	   The elections will be conducted on a no-party basis, and
candidates will run as individuals.
	   The elections would be the first conducted in Rwanda since the
1994 genocide when former Hutu soldiers and militiamen slaughtered
more than 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus.
	   The Rwandan Patriotic Front was initially a rebel movement
formed by Tutsis who had fled into exile in the late 1950s and
early 1960s after wholescale slaughters by the majority Hutus.
	   RPF rebels, who also included Hutus opposed to the extremist
government of President Juvenal Habyarimana, invaded Rwanda in
October 1990. In August 1993, they negotiated a power-sharing
agreement with Habyarimana under which elections would have taken
place in August 1999.
	   In April 1994, Habyarimana died when his plane was shot down
over Kigali by unidentified attackers. The incident signaled the
beginning of the carefully planned massacre that lasted for 90 days
and was only ended when the RPF assumed power in July.
	   Since then, the country has been run by RPF and seven other
political parties who formed a transitional government of national
unity.
	   The decision to hold local elections was made by a powerful but
informal forum representing all parties, the cabinet, the National
Assembly, president of the Supreme Court and his vice president and
prefects, who are the representatives of the central government in
the country's 11 prefectures, Mulingade said.
	   The forum has been meeting every Saturday in Kigali.
	   Mulingade said the forum, which last met on July 24, instructed
the Ministry of Interior to begin preparations for the elections.

Cuba crushes the Netherlands, moves to semifinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: will be updated with late games &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME _ Veteran infielder Omar Linares smacked in a grand slam
and starting pitcher Jose Ibar tossed a three-hitter to lead Cuba
to a 12-1 victory over the Netherlands Friday in the quarterfinals
of the World Baseball Championships.
	   Cuba, which is aiming to clinch its sixth consecutive title,
advanced to Saturday's semifinals. It has claimed the gold medal at
every world championship it has played in since 1952, and has a
total of 21 titles from 24 tournaments overall.
	   ``The team is playing so well,'' said Cuban manager Alfonso
Urquiola. ``I am confident we can win the championships again.''
	   Ibar, the first man to record 20 wins in a Cuban league season,
pitched for the entire game _ only seven innings due to the 10-run
mercy rule _ and struck out seven batters.
	   Known as ``El Nino,'' the 30-year-old Linares helped Cuba
collect a total of 13 hits compared to the Netherlands' three.
	   Oscar Machado cracked another homer in the fourth inning to seal
the victory, Cuba's 39th consecutive win at the Worlds.
	   South Korea also advanced to the semifinals after defeating
Japan 8-5 in 10 innings.
	   Australia, which qualified for the quarterfinals at the top of
its pool with a 5-2 record, faced Italy later Friday, while
Nicaragua played the Dominican Republic.
	   The top four teams of each of the two eight-country pools
advanced to the quarterfinals. The final is set for Sunday.
	   The tournament is open to professionals for the first time but
no players from the Major Leagues are participating. Some minor
leaguers are playing for the Dominican Republic and Canada, which
failed to qualify for the quarters along with the United States.

MLS pits top U.S. players against world stars
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FRED GOODALL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ Forget East vs. West. Major League
Soccer is giving its American stars a chance to settle a score
against the world.
	   And while a victory Sunday in the MLS All-Star game won't
necessarily atone for a poor World Cup showing this summer, it
would do wonders for some bruised egos.
	   Nine members of the U.S. team that loss all three games in
France are among 11 starters for the MLS USA All-Stars, who'll face
the league's top international players at the Florida Citrus Bowl.
	   ``We want to show all those guys that we're right there with
them,'' Tampa Bay Mutiny midfielder Frankie Hejduk said. ``We've
got a team here, the starting 11, that have played together before.
We're going to come at them with everything we've got. Let's just
hope they're ready for it.''
	   After matching the best between the Eastern and Western
conferences in East Rutherford, New Jersey, the past two years,
league officials opted for a United States vs. World format in a
new setting.
	   Orlando caught the attention of MLS officials when the city
hosted games during World Cup '94. The league held spring training
in Orlando this year and Sunday's game will be part of a
doubleheader featuring an opening friendly match between the U.S.
women's national team and Canada.
	   Although Florida has not been a particularly strong market for
the MLS attendance-wise, with Tampa Bay and Miami ranking near the
bottom of league averages, a crowd of more than 40,000 is expected.
	   And while officials stop short of saying the weekend could
provide a gauge of how Central Florida might support a team, they
clearly are measuring the reception for the first major MLS event
outside a league city.
	   ``We will probably try and put other games in the market to test
it over the course of time,'' MLS commissioner Doug Logan said.
``But it's not No. 1 on our (expansion) list for 2000 or 2002.''
	   The format for the game has changed, regardless that many of the
faces remain the same. Half the 22 starters selected by fans _ six
for the U.S. squad and five for the world _ also appeared in the
first two All-Star games.
	   Colombian midfielder Carlos Valderrama, Most Valuable Player
award winner in the past two All-Star games, is expected to start
for the world team despite being slapped with a league-record dlrs
10,000 fine earlier this week for refusing to train for the Miami
Fusion in a dispute with new coach Ivo Wortmann.
	   The leading scorer in the brief history of the All-Star game
with one goal and four assists, Valderrama is joined in the world
lineup by one other player who represented his country in World Cup
_ Mexican goalkeeper Jorge Campos of the Chicago Fire.
	   Two-time defending MLS champion D.C. United sent a league-high
five starters to the game (two Americans, three world), while the
New York-New Jersey Metrostars had three starters selected for the
U.S. squad and one for the world team.
	   Fifteen of the 22 starters were picked from the Eastern
Conference. One notable Western Conference player who was left off
the United States roster when reserves were announced was San
Jose's Eric Wynalda, the all-time leading scorer for the U.S.
national team.
	   The U.S. starters include goalkeeper Tony Meola of the
MetroStars; his teammates Tab Ramos and Alexi Lalas; Brian McBride
of Columbus, the only American to score at France 98; Tampa's
Frankie Hejduk, bound for Germany's Bayer Leverkusen, Los Angeles'
Cobi Jones; D.C. United defender Eddie Pope and his teammate John
Harkes, controversially dropped from the U.S. World Cup side in
May.
	   Poland's Peter Nowak (Chicago), voted a starter for the World
All-Stars, will miss the game because of a sprained left knee.
Nowever, the lineup is still formidable with Valderrama, Campos,
Salvadorans Mauricio Cienfuegos (Los Angeles) and Raul Diaz Arce
(New England), Uruguay's Adrian Paz (Colorado), and Canada's Geoff
Aunger and Bolivian Marco Etcheverry of D.C. United.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Starting Lineups &QC; 
	   United States: Tony Meola (New York-New Jersey); Eddie Pope
(Washington), Alexi Lalas (New York-New Jersey), Marcelo Balboa
(Colorado); Frankie Hejduk (Tampa Bay), Thomas Dooley (Columbus),
Tab Ramos (New York-New Jersey), John Harkes (Washington), Cobi
Jones (Los Angeles); Preki (Kansas City), Brian McBride (Columbus).
	   World: Jorge Campos (Mexico, Chicago); Geoff Aunger (Canada,
Washington); Jan Eriksson (Sweden, Tampa Bay); Diego Sonora
(Argentina, New York-New Jersey); Adrian Paz (Uruguay, Colorado);
x-Martin Machon (Guatemala, Los Angeles); Mauricio Cienfuegos (El
Salvador, Los Angeles); Carlos Valderrama (Colombia, Miami), Marco
Etcheverry (Bolivia, Washington); Jaime Moreno (Bolivia,

Iakovakis triumphs in 400 hurdles; Li, Bilunas lift women's gold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANNECY, France (AP) _ Greece's Periklis Iakovakis ran a personal
best time of 49.82 seconds Friday to lift the 400 meters hurdle
gold medal at the World Junior championship.
	   Periklis' performance, the best of the year by a junior, was
just enough to see off challenges by Cuba's Osiris Martinez and
Peter Bate of Australia.
	   In the 800 meters, Kenya's William Chirchir just beat countryman
Wilfred Bungei to win the gold in 1:47.23, while at 400 meters
there was victory for Nigeria's Nduka Awazie.
	   In the women's competitions, Lithuania's Zigmas Bilunas won gold
in the 400 meter race, ahead of U.S. sprinter Nakiya Johnson, who
posted a personal best time of 52.09 to clinch silver.
	   In the 400 meter hurdles, China's Yu Lian Li, the reigning Asian
champion at the distance, won impressively in 55.93 seconds, ahead
of silver medalist Allison Beckford of Jamaica.
	   In a close 800 meter race, Russia's Olga Mikayeva held off a
challenge from African junior champion Jebet Langat of Kenya to win
gold in 2:05.34.

Cuba crushes the Netherlands, moves to semifinals

	   ROME (AP) _ Omar Linares hit a grand slam and Jose Ibar tossed a
three-hitter to lead Cuba to a 12-1 quarterfinal victory over the
Netherlands at the World Baseball Championship on Friday.
	   Cuba, aiming for its sixth consecutive title, advanced to
Saturday's semifinals. It has won the gold medal at every world
championship it has played in since 1952, a total of 21 titles in
24 tournaments tries.
	   ``The team is playing so well,'' Cuban manager Alfonso Urquiola
said. ``I am confident we can win the championship again.''
	   Ibar, the first man to record 20 victories in a Cuban league
season, needed only seven innings due to the 10-run rule _ and
struck out seven.
	   Known as ``El Nino,'' the 30-year-old Linares was part of a
13-hit effort, which also included Oscar Machado fourth-inning
homer, that earned Cuba's 39th consecutive victory at the World
Championship.
	   South Korea also advanced to the semifinals with a 8-5 victory
over Japan in 10 innings.
	   Australia, which qualified for the quarterfinals at the top of
its pool with a 5-2 record, faced Italy later Friday, while
Nicaragua played the Dominican Republic.
	   The top four teams of each of the two eight-country pools
advanced to the quarterfinals. The final is set for Sunday.
	   The tournament is open to professionals for the first time but
no players from U.S. Major League Baseball are participating. Some
players who play for U.S. minor league teams are playing for the
Dominican Republic and Canada, which failed to qualify for the
quarters along with the United States.

Moscow mayor wants North, South Korean Embassies together
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov proposed Friday that the
North and South Korean Embassies be located next to each other, on
the assumption the two countries will eventually reunite, a news
agency said Friday.
	   ``Then it will be enough to remove the fence for a single
embassy to be established,'' said Luzhkov, who has tried to parlay
his mayoral job into a statesman's post.
	   Capitalist South Korea and communist North Korea have never
signed a peace treaty ending their 1950-53 war, and their border
remains one of the most tense and heavily fortified in the world.
	   North Korea's embassy now is located in southwestern Moscow and
South Korea's is more centrally located.

Australia off to rough start

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, GREECE (AP) _ Australia's team _ nicknamed the Boomers _
has been an early bust in the World Championship.
	   Silver medalists just days ago at the Goodwill Games, Australia
dropped its first two games here to Argentina and Spain _ neither
regarded as a medal contender.
	   Australia was fourth in the Atlanta Olympics, but this team is
younger and still adjusting, says coach Barry Barnes.
	   ``You watch all the European teams, playing what we don't play
at home. We play a very loose, free flowing, running, shooting
style of game.
	   ``But this group now is still learning the way. We're still
becoming a little extravagant at times, when we really don't have
to be,'' he added.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   WELL HEALED: &LR;  Australian guard Shane Heal will join Greek
first-division team Near East later this month, reported to have
signed for dlrs 500,000.
	   ``There was a lot of media attention on me, there were fans from
Near East there to give me bouquets of flowers. Everyone's been
really nice,'' he said.
	   That will end quickly if Heal doesn't produce in
basketball-crazy Greece.
	   ``The Greek league is the most respected outside the NBA, so I
feel I'll be able to learn a lot here as an import,'' Heal added.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   DREAM TEAM: &LR;  Greek newspapers Friday poked a little fun at the
Americans after their 84-82 loss to Lithuania, ending a string of
26 consecutive U.S. wins in the Olympics and world championship.
	   ``The Lithuanians had the last laugh against the Americans,''
said a photo caption in Eleftheros Typos.
	   ``Lithuania, The Dream Team,'' ran a headline in the Exousia
newspaper.
	   Arturas Karnisovas, the former Seton Hall star who vexed the
Americans with 29 points on slashing drives through the lane, got
much of the headline attention in Greece where he starred for
Olympiakos.
	   ``King Arthur,'' headlined the daily Eleftherotypia.
	   ___
	   NO DOPING: &LR;  Australians, in their warm-up Friday against
Nigeria, wore t-shirts with the phrase ``No Doping'' written across
the front accompanied by a drawing of a basketball being punctured
by a hypodermic needle.
	   Their message was directed at Nigeria player Julius Nwosu, who
was suspended Friday by FIBA _ the world governing body of
basketball _ after testing positive for ephedrime in Wednesday's
opening loss to Spain. It was the first positive drug test
announced a the championship.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   REBOUNDS: &LR;  The Argentine team got steamed the other day when
they were without towels on the bench _ a necessity in Athens where
temperatures have been hovering around 100 F (38 C) for days. ...
Senegal's players _ with no chance to medal _ have been enjoying
themselves and were seen out the other night until 5 a.m. at a
local club _ Glyfada's KingSize Club.

Austria's agricultural minister recalls tons of beef for inspection
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Austrian agricultural authorities Friday
recalled tons of beef exported to Italy because of fears the
shipment may be contaminated with dangerously high levels of
cancer-causing hormones.
	   The beef was immediately recalled to Austria for inspections,
the Austrian Press Agency reported, after tests conducted on six
tons of Austrian beef in Italy revealed the abnormally high levels
of hormones that are cancerous in high doses.
	   The Ministry of Agriculture has demanded an explanation from the
veterinarian authorities, who are conducting tests. The results are
not expected until next week.
	   Feeding hormones to animals raised for slaughter has been
illegal in Austria since 1975. Butchers and farmers in Austrian are
subject to regular quality tests to determine whether the meat has
been injected with any illegal hormones.
	   Every third shipment of Austrian beef destined for Italy is now
being withheld for inspections. The slaughterhouses where the meat
originated were also ordered to undergo strict tests, as were the
farms where the cattle were raised.
	   Authorities have set up a hotline and are recommending people
not eat beef or sausages until tests results are available.

Russia campaigns for Iraq inspections to be replaced by monitoring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Foreign Ministry on Friday reiterated Russia's
call for U.N. inspections of Iraq's nuclear facilities to be
replaced by less intrusive, occasional monitoring.
	   ``Moscow firmly believes that there are no reasons why Iraq's
nuclear file cannot be closed,'' ministry spokesman Vladimir
Rakhmanin told reporters.
	   The Interfax news agency quoted him as saying that a report
released this week by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the
U.N. nuclear watchdog, showed that ``despite some ambiguity about
Iraq's nuclear program in the past, the progress made so far ...
makes it possible to raise the issue of the IAEA starting a
long-term monitoring plan.''
	   Rakhmanin said the U.N. Security Council could institute such a
plan once Iraq enacted a law punishing anyone who violates U.N.
disarmament resolutions.
	   Russia failed Wednesday to persuade the Security Council to
scale back nuclear inspections in Iraq. Washington had successfully
blocked a similar effort by Russia, France and China after the
previous IAEA report in April.
	   That report and the one considered Wednesday said U.N.
inspectors had found no evidence that Baghdad was trying to
maintain its nuclear program. But the reports said the inspectors
also couldn't certify that no such evidence existed.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic gave his personal assurance Friday that relief workers
can deliver aid to thousands of Kosovo Albanians who fled into the
hills to escape a major government offensive, a U.S. envoy said.
	   The envoy, Christopher Hill, said Milosevic promised that he
would take ``personal responsibility'' for allowing aid workers
access to refugees.
	   Hill said the Yugoslav president also agreed to allow
international monitors to escort the civilians home to avoid
intimidation by local authorities.
	   Hill arrived in the Kosovo provincial capital Friday following a
two-hour meeting with Milosevic in Belgrade. Hill said Milosevic
repeated his promise _ made to European Union delegation Thursday _
that the week-long Serb offensive against the Kosovo Liberation
Army was over.
	   Serb forces drove the KLA from several key strongholds during
the operation.
	   Despite the pledge, scattered clashes were reported by both Serb
and ethnic Albanian sources Friday. The government's Tanjug news
agency said eight ethnic Albanian ``terrorists'' were killed and
several were arrested Friday when they attacked Serb police near
Lipljane, some 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of Pristina. Three
Serb policemen were seriously wounded, the report said.
	   In a statement broadcast Friday by Albanian state television,
KLA spokesman Jakup Krasniqi expressed disappointment that the
world had not reacted more strongly to the Serb offensive.
	   ``The Kosovo Liberation Army will be more strong and more
professional than it is now,'' Krasniqi said. ``The Serbian
offensive can never bring the KLA to its knees. We will fight the
Serbian vandals until our victory, so long as we have breath.''

Barnes' B sample tests positive, faces lifetime ban
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The second part of shot putter Randy Barnes'
doping test is positive, and now he must appeal to U.S. athletics
authorities to avoid a lifetime suspension.
	   Athletics world governing body on Friday confirmed the B sample
from Barnes' out-of-competition test April 1 tested positive for a
banned nutritional supplement.
	   Barnes, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist and world indoor and
outdoor record-holder, faces a lifetime ban for a second offense.
His next step is to go before USA Track and Field's Doping Hearing
Board.
	   ``After the hearing, if the panel decides he is guilty, he will
be suspended for life,'' Giorgio Reineri, a spokesman for the
International Amateur Athletic Federation, said from Annecy,
France, site of the World Junior Championships. ``If the panel
decides he is not guilty, he could be free to compete again.''
	   To go before the board, Barnes must make a request by the second
week of August, said lawyer Bob Duplantis, who along with his son,
Greg, represents Barnes.
	   Actually, there could be two more steps available to Barnes if
the three-member hearing board finds against him. The first would
be to go before USATF's Doping Appeals Board, a different
three-member panel. The appeals board cannot hear new evidence; it
can determine only whether protocol was followed.
	   If discrepancies are found, the appeals board can dismiss the
case. It then goes back to the IAAF, which can agree with the board
or say Barnes is banned. If the IAAF bans Barnes, he then can go to
binding arbitration.
	   Barnes' test in Charleston, West Virginia, on April 1 showed he
had used the nutritional supplement androstenedione, which
increases the body's ability to produce its own testosterone
naturally.
	   Barnes said earlier in the week he did not know the drug was on
the banned list.
	   ``I would never knowingly take a prohibited substance,'' he
said. ``I did not receive notice from USATF or the IAAF that this
supplement was prohibited until after the drug test.''
	   ``We still do not know when it was put on the list,'' Duplantis
said. ``It looks like it was put on the list after the first of the
year, but we're not sure when. USATF did not know either. It said
it would find out.''
	   Barnes served a two-year suspension beginning in 1991 for
testing positive for the steroid methyltestosterone at a meet in
Malmo, Sweden, in August 1990.
	   Earlier in the week, Craig Masback, executive director of USATF,
criticized the IAAF for the suspensions of Barnes and sprinter
Dennis Mitchell.
	   The IAAF said Mitchell tested positive for excessive
testosterone. Reineri said only Mitchell's A sample had been
analyzed so far.

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash
condemned on Friday a European Court ruling, saying it closed the
door to any peace talks with Greek Cyprus.
	   The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg had ordered
Turkey to pay 320.000 Cyprus pounds (dlrs 704.000) to Titina
Loizidou, a Greek Cypriot refugee, for depriving her of the use of
her property in Kyrenia, a port in what is now Turkish-occupied
northern Cyprus.
	   The court held that Turkey, as the occupying power, was
responsible for developments in the north. It rejected any legal
status for the Turkish Cypriot breakaway state.
	   Denktash, who heads the Turkish Cypriot administration, said the
decision amounted to the ``total closure of all doors'' between
Turks and Greeks on Cyprus, which has been divided since Turkey
invaded in 1974 after a coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   ``Until this decision is reversed, there will be no discussions
with the Greek Cypriot side,'' Denktash said. The United States and
the European Union have repeatedly pressed him to resume
U.N.-chaired reconciliation talks.
	   ``The court's decision closes its eyes to the realities of
Cyprus, to the 35 year-old situation,'' Denktash said, recalling
the outbreak of inter-ethnic strife in Cyprus in 1963, ``(it) is
biased and politically-motivated.''
	   Denktash added there were up to 70,000 Turkish Cypriots with
properties in southern Cyprus, which is run by the Greek-dominated
Cypriot government.
	   Turkey rejected the ruling Thursday, saying responsibility for
the north lay with the Turkish Cypriot state.
	   The Cypriot government, however, welcomed the court ruling
Friday as ``a landmark decision that sets a legal precedent'' for
all the 180,000 Greek Cypriot refugees from the north.
	   Attorney-General Alecos Markides said that Turkey was obliged to
respect the ruling and that if it fails to do so, it will risk
being expelled from the Council of Europe.
	   The court of human rights falls under the 40-member Council of
Europe.
	   Separately on Friday, the Greek Cypriot mayor of Famagusta,
another port in the Turkish-occupied zone, appealed to the U.N.
Security Council to press for the return of the displaced Greek
Cypriot inhabitants.
	   The Greek Cypriot quarter of Famagusta has become a
weed-infested ghost town since 1974 when its 50,000 residents fled
before advancing Turkish troops.
	   ``Twenty-four years is too long a period to suffer the injustice
and violation of our fundamental human rights and freedom,'' Mayor
Andreas Pouyouros said in a letter he delivered to the Nicosia
embassies of the five permanent members of the Security Council.
	   The town council of Famagusta has continued to meet in southern
Cyprus since the invasion.
	   In a 1984 resolution, the Security Council called for the return
of the Famagusta refugees as a step to promote rapprochement
between Greek and Turkish Cypriots.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A senior International Monetary Fund official
returned to Moscow on Friday to press Russia to enact economic
reforms that were demanded in exchange for a huge international
loan.
	   The IMF denied the fund is considering further loans to Russia,
whose markets remain skittish despite the promised dlrs 22.6
billion cash infusion.
	   Both the ruble and the stock market closed slightly lower
Friday, reflecting continued uncertainty about the government's
ability to address fundamental problems in the economy.
	   Stanley Fischer, first deputy managing director of the IMF, was
scheduled to hold talks Friday and Saturday with Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko, his finance minister and the chairman of the
Central Bank about cutting spending and improving tax collection.
	   In their Friday night talks, Fischer and Kiriyenko noted that
markets in many parts of the world are unstable, but that the
Russian government's austerity program should lead to stability
here, the government's press service said.

Probe into Rajiv Gandhi's assassination inconclusive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A seven-year investigation into the
assassination of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
concluded there was an international conspiracy to kill him, but
failed to establish who participated in it, reports said Friday.
	   The voluminous report prepared by Judge Milap Chand Jain was
presented in parliament Friday. The report is likely to cause an
uproar because it is inconclusive and raises many more questions.
	   The report singles out a local party in Tamil Nadu, the state
where Gandhi was killed, as supporters of the Sri Lankan rebels
blamed for the killing. Twenty-six Tamil rebels were convicted and
were sentenced to death earlier this year.
	   The report said Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi and his
government tacitly supported the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.
	   The report also said there was circumstantial evidence that
Chandraswami, a holy man who is facing multiple charges of fraud,
was involved in Gandhi's assassination. But the report falls short
of accusing him of conspiring to kill Gandhi. The report also hints
at the involvement of international spy agencies but offers no
proof.
	   The report cleared two former prime ministers, Chandra Shekhar
and V.P. Singh, of any direct or indirect involvement in Gandhi's
1991 assassination.
	   The two politicians have been accused of not providing adequate
security for Gandhi, who was leader of the opposition and had grave
security risks.
	   To clarify questions left unanswered in the report, the
government has ordered a panel should be set up to establish the
guilt of those accused in the Jain report.

Governor wants simulated invasion of Russia called off
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian-American naval exercises that would
simulate an invasion of Russia should be canceled, a regional
governor in the Far East said Friday.
	   Primorye Gov. Yevgeny Nazdratenko said the exercises scheduled
to begin Tuesday in Vladivostok coincide with the 60th anniversary
of fighting around nearby Lake Khasan, when Chinese troops had to
be beaten back.
	   Demonstrators picketed the U.S. consulate in Vladivostok on
Wednesday to protest the six days of naval maneuvers involving
Russia's Pacific Fleet and the U.S. Seventh Fleet.
	   The exercises, code-named ``Cooperation at Sea 98,'' involve
training to respond to natural disasters. Among other exercises,
U.S. Marines are to conduct mock landings on the outskirts of
Vladivostok.
	   The governor's press secretary, Natalia Vstovskaya quoted him as
``doubting the appropriateness of the maneuvers,'' Russian news
agencies reported.

Piech says VW, BMW could consider minority stakes in each other
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Britain-Rolls-Royce &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Volkswagen and BMW, the two German automakers
planning to divide Rolls-Royce, could ensure a close relationship
by exchanging shares in their companies, Volkswagen chief Ferdinand
Piech said Friday.
	   In an interview for Saturday's edition of Die Welt daily, Piech
declined to comment on recent German media reports that Volkswagen
and BMW were considering an eventual full merger.
	   But Piech was quoted as saying that each of the two German
automakers could consider selling a minority share of 24.9 percent
to the other.
	   ``Such an interconnection would make the companies stronger,
even unbeatable,'' Piech said.
	   The companies battled each other this year to buy Rolls-Royce,
with Volkswagen ending up with the British factory that builds the
cars for dlrs 790 million and BMW with rights to the brand name for
dlrs 66 million.
	   BMW has announced plans to start up a new Rolls-Royce Motor Cars
company on Jan. 1, 2003, but will let VW use the brand name for
free until then.
	   In the meantime, the automakers plan to cooperate to produce the
latest Rolls-Royce model, the Silver Seraph, and BMW will supply
engines and components for Rolls-Royce cars until the end of 2002.

U.S.-Australia urge U.N. intervention in Myanmar crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.N. reaction, recasts, edits to tighten, trims &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM RAUM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright asked U.N. chief Kofi Annan to intervene in the Myanmar
crisis, saying the military regime had ``increased its isolation''
by harsh treatment of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.
	   Albright and Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer
suggested that political tensions in the nation also known as Burma
could escalate.
	   ``There is widespread concern in Asia,'' Downer said Friday at a
news conference with Albright after U.S.-Australian talks.
	   Albright was heading to New Zealand on Saturday, her last stop
in a 10-day tour of Asia.
	   Albright and Downer called Annan on Friday to make a direct
appeal for intervention in Myanmar. ``He said he was going to take
a very careful look,'' Albright said.
	   U.S. officials said they expect Annan to go along.
	   ``Burma has moved further away from reconciliation and has
increased its isolation,'' Albright said, citing the standoff
between the military regime and Suu Kyi.
	   Downer raised the possibility that refugees from Myanmar soon
may flock to Thailand.
	   Albright has sought to rally world opinion against the military
regime and its treatment of Suu Kyi, an opposition party leader and
winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize.
	   On Wednesday, government police forcibly returned Suu Kyi to her
home in the capital of Yangon, ending a six-day highway standoff.
	   ``We had a discussion with the secretary general telling him
that we were very concerned about the fact that it is difficult for
diplomats on the ground to be involved in some of he negotiating
processes,'' Albright told a news conference.
	   Albright said she urged Annan to get personally involved.
Albright said she plans further discussions when both she and Annan
are back in the United States.
	   ``I think he joined our concern about the fact that the handling
of her was so inappropriate in terms of the way that one handles
any citizen of a country, much less the leader of an opposition
(party). And he wanted to hear more from us about what we knew.''
	   Annan had already planned to send his envoy, the assistant
secretary-general for political affairs, Alvaro de Soto, to Myanmar
this fall, possibly in October.
	   Those plans have not changed, said U.N. spokesman Juan Carlos
Brandt.
	   De Soto plans to discuss the human rights situation there with
government officials and will prepare a report.
	   Annan will continue to keep watch over the situation, he said.
	   Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party won parliamentary
elections in 1990 but never was allowed to take office because the
government annulled the vote.
	   On other issues, Albright said the United States hopes to
resolve a dispute with Australia over wheat exports to Indonesia.
President Bill Clinton's announcement that he would provide free
wheat to Indonesia as a humanitarian gesture has angered Australian
wheat farmers, who contend it will undercut their sales.
	   ``Our programs are intended to feed hungry people,'' Albright
said, noting that the Asian financial crisis and political turmoil
in Indonesia has made hunger there widespread.
	   In an attempt to meet Australian concerns, Albright said the
United States will do its best to ensure that wheat gets to those
who are needy, and does not distort markets.
	   After delivery of 500,000 tons of wheat that Clinton had already
promised Indonesia, the government will hold off on another one
million tons and distribute it ``only if there is a need for it,''
Albright said.
	   Defense Secretary William Cohen, who also attended the
conference, said the U.S.-Australian talks also dealt with efforts
to protect defense-related information against computer theft and
electronic espionage.

Britain's defense minister expected in South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Britain's minister of state
for defense, Lord John Gilbert, is expected to visit South Africa
starting Monday to discuss co-operation.
	   Officials will also discuss the British military advisory
training team's role in the integration process of the South
African National Defense Force.
	   Since 1994's first democratic elections, the government has been
trying to combine former members of the anti-apartheid African
National Congress's military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, with the
apartheid-era army.
	   Gilbert was expected to meet Defense Minister Joe Modise, his
deputy Ronnie Kasrils, South African National Defense Force chief
Siphiwe Nyanda and other officials.

Foreign ministers expected at peace meetings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ Border foes Ethiopia and
Eritrea will fly their foreign ministers to this West African
country on Saturday to meet diplomats bidding to end a simmering
frontier dispute, officials said Friday.
	   Although the opponents have not agreed to meet face-to-face,
Eritrea's Haile Woldetensae and Ethiopia's Seyoum Mesfin are
expected to talk separately with Organization of African Unity
officials on Sunday morning, Burkina Faso Foreign Minister Ablasse
Ouedraogo said.
	   African diplomats led by OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim
will present the feuding sides with a list of peace proposals being
developed by ambassadors from Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe and Djibouti,
Ouedraogo said.
	   ``If they agree with the proposals, we are going to ask them to
sign an agreement,'' the minister said, adding the mediators would
try to convince the Ethiopians and Eritreans to meet directly.
	   Fighting broke out briefly between the two countries in mid-May,
and in early June both sides bombed each other's territory. It is
believed several hundred people _ perhaps more _ perished before
the fighting died down in mid-June.
	   Both sides have massed troops along the contested portion of the
border and the situation is at a stalemate.
	   The opponents have refused to meet each other and Ethiopia has
demanded that Eritrea first pull out of the disputed region.
Eritrea, meanwhile, insists rightful ownership over area under its
control.
	   Ethiopia says it was Eritrea's invasion of the two districts of
Badme and Shiraro on May 6 on the western end of the 960-kilometer
(600-mile) border separating the two countries that precipitated
the crisis and subsequent fighting.
	   But Eritrea has called Ethiopia's saber-rattling a ``bluff'' to
maneuver the international community into pressuring Eritrea to
withdraw. The two countries were one until Eritrea won its
independence in 1993.
	   A United Nations mission to Ethiopia's northern Tigray and
eastern Afar regions said as many as 100,000 people had been
displaced by the fighting. Ethiopia puts the figure at 180,000.
	   Eritrea says 100,000 of its people alone have been forced to
flee because of the conflict.
	   Tens of thousands of Ethiopian women rallied in towns throughout
the country Friday for a peaceful end to the three-month border
dispute.

Nigerian tests positive at World Championship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Nwosu quotes. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Nigerian center Julius Nwosu, who had a
brief pro career in the United States, was suspended Friday from
the World Basketball Championship after testing positive for the
banned substance ephedrine, FIBA officials announced.
	   The sport's world governing body said in a brief statement that
Nwosu had been suspended but did not specify for how long.
	   He was on the bench, in street clothes, for Nigeria's game
against Australia later Friday.
	   ``That's FIBA, you can't fight FIBA,'' Nwosu told The Associated
Press at halftime of the game. ``I'm always clean. It's just been
blown out of proportion.''
	   He said he thinks the positive sample, taken after Nigeria's
80-68 loss to Spain on Wednesday, resulted because he is taking a
vitamin supplement called Up The Gas.
	   ``I have a knee injury and so the solution is either to drink a
lot of milk or take the vitamins,'' he said.
	   FIBA said Nwosu's A-sample contained ``an abnormally high
level'' of ephedrine, which is classed as a stimulant and is
typically found in cold medications. Its use normally carries a
warning or a ban of three months or fewer.
	   Nigeria's games at the two-week tournament are not subject to
forfeit, FIBA said.
	   Nwosu, 27, has had short stints in the CBA and NBA and played
last season with Galatasaray in the Turkish League.
	   The 2.06-meter (6-foot-10) player was suspended indefinitely by
the Connecticut Pride of the CBA in Ja

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Rod Laver was moved out of the intensive unit
on Friday and is able to talk following a stroke on Monday.
	   The tennis great's condition was upgraded from serious to fair
at UCLA Medical Center. He is expected to remain in the hospital
about one more week.
	   Laver, who will be 60 on Aug. 8, still has difficulty moving his
right arm and right leg, said Dr. Neil Martin, co-director of the
hospital's stroke center.
	   The Australian, who now lives in nearby Newport Beach, sustained
a small hemorrhage on the left side of his brain.
	   He was a short distance from the hospital Monday when he was
stricken while doing an interview for cable television sports
channel ESPN on the century's greatest athletes.
	   Nicknamed ``Rocket'' for the power of his left-handed serves and
returns, Laver is the only player to have won two Grand Slams _
winner of the Australian, French and U.S. championships and
Wimbledon the same calendar year. He won his first Grand Slam as an
amateur in 1962 and as a professional in 1969.
	   He was the world's No. 1 player in 1961, 1962, 1968 and 1969,
and was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in
1981.
	   Laver won 11 singles titles in Grand Slam events, one fewer than
career leader Roy Emerson. Bjorn Borg and Pete Sampras also have
won 11 Grand Slam events.
	   Laver won Wimbledon four times, the Australian crown three times
and the U.S. and French titles twice each.
	   He was the first professional to amass more than dlrs 1 million
in earnings. He retired from full-time tennis in the mid-1970s.

Death toll crosses 300 in Bangladesh floods

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Officials reported 54 more deaths from
drowning and flood-related illness in Bangladesh over the last two
days, bringing the death toll in three weeks of floods to 327, a
government spokesman said Friday.
	   As many as 39,000 people were ill from water-borne diseases such
as diarrhea and viral fever as almost half of Bangladesh was
flooded and marooned people were drinking polluted water, spokesman
Mohammad Badiuzzman said.
	   The government has sent nearly 20,000 doctors and health workers
with medicine and water-purification tablets to the flooded areas,
but they could not reach many places for lack of transport.
	   The country's worst flooding in 10 years has been caused by
torrential monsoon rains that have inundated 37 of 64 districts.
	   The overflowing rivers in the country's main basins _ Ganges,
Brahmaputra and Meghna _ have washed out more than 5,000 kilometers
of roads, 3,000 kilometers of embankments and 2,100 bridges.
	   The floods swept away 176,000 mainly mud-and-thatch huts and
damaged standing crops on 258,000 acres (104,400 hectares) of land,
the spokesman said.
	   According to Badiuzzman, the water level has started falling in
20 districts, but the situation is still serious in 17 others,
mainly in central and southern regions.
	   Low-lying areas of Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital of 8 million,
are filled with waist-high water. At least 800,000 people living in
the city's shanty towns have been affected and many of them are in
crowded relief centers.
	   Bangladesh, situated on one of the world's largest deltas, is
hit by floods and cyclones that kill hundreds of people every year.

Tropical storm strengethens off Mexico's Pacific coast
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES tropical storm Alex's condition, ADD comments from
hurricane specialist, center director. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A tropical storm that formed off of Mexico's
Pacific coast is expected to become a hurricane but was heading
west and away from land, the U.S. National Hurricane Center
reported.
	   Tropical storm Estelle was over 300 miles (483 kilometers) south
of Manzanillo, Mexico at 11:00 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT), with sustained
winds of nearly 70 mph (113 kph). It was heading west at about 9
mph (14 kph).
	   Hurricanes have minimum sustained wind speeds of 74 mph (119
kph).
	   Forecasters said it Estelle would probably grow to hurricane
force by Friday, but early predictions of the track indicated it
was unlikely to hit land.
	   In Miami, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center said
Friday that as tropical storm Alex weakens, it could move closer to
Puerto Rico and other Caribbean islands, but the threat is minimal.
	   ``The good news is that the storm is falling apart,'' center
director Jerry Jarrell said.
	   But the storm is centered farther south than earlier thought, so
it could go closer to the islands than previously anticipated, he
said.
	   At 1500 GMT Friday, Alex was located near 15.5 north latitude,
49.5 west longitude, or about 725 miles (1,166 kilometers) east of
the Leeward Islands in the eastern Caribbean.
	   Jarrell said the storm doesn't have a chance to strengthen in
the short term as it advances with 50 mph (80 kph) winds toward the
northeastern Caribbean Sea.
	   ``(It's not) particularly bad news for Puerto Rico and the
(Virgin) Islands,'' Jarrell said. ``It looks like it wouldn't be
much of a storm, even if it gets there,'' in two or three days.
	   Hurricane specialist Lixion Avila said Alex may weaken enough by
late Friday to be recategorized as a tropical depression. It is
expected to continue moving near 12 mph (19 kph) to the west
northwest, he said.

Turkish Cyprus condemns Strasbourg ruling, rules out peace talks

 &UR; Eds: ADDS Greek Cypriot reaction to Denktash graf 2 and 11; no

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash
condemned Friday a European Court ruling on a refugee's property,
saying it killed any chance of peace talks with Greek Cyprus.
	   The Greek Cypriot attorney-general said Denktash's rejection
constituted contempt of the European Court of Human Rights.
	   The court in Strasbourg had ordered Turkey to pay 320.000 Cyprus
pounds (dlrs 704.000) to Titina Loizidou, a Greek Cypriot refugee,
for depriving her of the use of her property in Kyrenia, a port in
what is now Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus.
	   The court held that Turkey, as the occupying power, was
responsible for developments in the north. It rejected any legal
status for the Turkish Cypriot breakaway state.
	   Denktash, who heads the Turkish Cypriot administration, said the
decision amounted to the ``total closure of all doors'' between
Turks and Greeks on Cyprus, which has been divided since Turkey
invaded in 1974 after a coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   ``Until this decision is reversed, there will be no discussions
with the Greek Cypriot side,'' Denktash said. The United States and
the European Union have repeatedly pressed him to resume
U.N.-chaired reconciliation talks.
	   ``The court's decision closes its eyes to the realities of
Cyprus, to the 35 year-old situation,'' Denktash said, recalling
the outbreak of inter-ethnic strife in Cyprus in 1963, ``(it) is
biased and politically-motivated.''
	   Denktash added there were up to 70,000 Turkish Cypriots with
properties in southern Cyprus, which is run by the Greek-dominated
Cypriot government.
	   Turkey rejected the ruling Thursday, saying responsibility for
the north lay with the Turkish Cypriot state.
	   The Cypriot government, however, welcomed the court ruling
Friday as ``a landmark decision that sets a legal precedent'' for
all the 180,000 Greek Cypriot refugees from the north.
	   Attorney-General Alecos Markides said Denktash's rebuttal was
``brazen and amounts to contempt of the European Court.''
	   Speaking to Cypriot television, Markides said the same could be
said of Turkey's rejection.
	   Earlier Markides had said that if Turkey fails to respect the
ruling, it would risk being expelled from the Council of Europe.
	   The court of human rights falls under the 40-member Council of
Europe.
	   Separately on Friday, the Greek Cypriot mayor of Famagusta,
another port in the Turkish-occupied zone, appealed to the U.N.
Security Council to press for the return of the displaced Greek
Cypriot inhabitants.
	   The Greek Cypriot quarter of Famagusta has become a
weed-infested ghost town since 1974 when its 50,000 residents fled
before advancing Turkish troops.
	   ``Twenty-four years is too long a period to suffer the injustice
and violation of our fundamental human rights and freedom,'' Mayor
Andreas Pouyouros said in a letter he delivered to the Nicosia
embassies of the five permanent members of the Security Council.
	   The town council of Famagusta has continued to meet in southern
Cyprus since the invasion.
	   In a 1984 resolution, the Security Council called for the return
of the Famagusta refugees as a step to promote rapprochement
between Greek and Turkish Cypriots.

Rescuers search for bodies of victims of plane crash
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with wreckage, bodies, black box reportedly located

<TEXT>
	   VANNES, France (AP) _ Rescuers on Friday located wreckage,
bodies and possibly a black box flight recorder from the crash of
two small planes carrying 15 people off the Brittany coast the day
before, officials said.
	   The French navy divers located two sections of a Beechcraft
belonging to Proteus Airlines on the bottom of the bay of Quiberon,
a port 500 kilometers (310 miles) southwest of Paris. Several
bodies were seen inside, authorities said.
	   The aircraft, with 12 passengers and two crew aboard, collided
with a Cessna belonging to the local flying club, when the Proteus
pilot decided to give passengers a better look at an ocean liner
while on a regularly scheduled commercial flight from Lyon to
Lorient, a coastal city in Brittany.
	   Judicial sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
divers located the black boxes in the twin-engine plane, but
authorities running the salvage operation did not immediately
confirm it.
	   Capt. Joel Royer said the divers would have to wait until
Saturday to bring the debris and bodies to the surface with the
help of equipment. Six bodies were recovered on Thursday.
	   Meanwhile, the president of Proteus Airlines said the pilot of
the Beechcraft apparently did not respect the company's flight
procedures when he made a detour to fly over the ship Norway to
give the passengers a better look.
	   ``It is clear that barring procedure and immediate danger,
flying by sight is prohibited by Proteus,'' said Franklin Devaux,
the company president. ``It's clear there was a change of course,
that he apparently flew over the Norway.''
	   Minutes before the crash, the Proteus pilot contact the control
tower at Lorient-Lann Bihoue Airport to request authorization for
the overflight.
	   Investigators have launched an investigation of the collision.
	   Created in 1986, Proteus provides service to 12 cities in
France. The company has about 20 planes and is partially owned by
the U.S. airliner Delta.
	   It was the worst air accident in France since 1992 when an
Airbus 320 crashed near Strasbourg killing 87 people.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Spanish opera star Montserrat Caballe performed at
a benefit concert in the Kremlin's Cathedral Square on Friday.
	   Caballe sang a piece written for voice and the bells of the
belfry of Ivan the Great, one of the oldest and largest bell towers
in Russia, and joined an international children's choir in singing
selections from Bizet's opera Carmen.
	   Caballe planned to donate the proceeds from the concert to a
charity to help talented disabled children, the Interfax news
agency said.
	   Tickets cost between 130 and 2,000 rubles (dlrs 21.50 to 330).
One-thousand free tickets were given to children, dozens of whom
sat in wheelchairs in the front rows.
	   The concert also featured Caballe's daughter Martine and an
international symphony orchestra of 1,650 musicians, including 150
disabled children, Interfax said.

 &UR; Historians say Deutsche Bank profited from Holocaust victims' gold &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: AMs, recasts, adds quote from German Jewish leader, Deutsche
Bank, additional detail from report. &QL; 
 &UR; By IAN MADER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Historians tracing the origin of gold
bars Deutsche Bank traded during the Nazi era confirmed Friday that
the bank profited from gold plundered from Holocaust victims.
	   The historians were unable to determine with certainty whether
bank executives knew that some of the gold purchased from the
Reichsbank, the Nazi central bank, came directly from Jews sent to
concentration camps.
	   However, they said it is ``likely'' that top officials of
Deutsche Bank, now Germany's biggest private bank, were aware of
the origins of some of the gold.
	   The leader of Germany's Jewish community, Ignatz Bubis, said the
conclusion could have been more strongly worded.
	   ``The people at the top, I think, all knew where the gold came
from,'' Bubis said. ``There was a conspiracy of silence.''
	   German television reported in December that the bank had bought
Reichsbank gold robbed from Jews.
	   Deutsche Bank said at that time it was unaware of the trading
and announced it had commissioned five historians from Israel,
Germany, the United States and Britain to research the origin of
gold it bought during World War II.
	   Separately, Deutsche Bank was named in a lawsuit filed June 3 in
New York on behalf of 10,000 Holocaust survivors and victims'
relatives. That lawsuit, still pending, alleges Deutsche Bank and
Dresdner Bank profited from the looting of gold and other personal
property from Jewish victims of the Holocaust.
	   The panel of five historians from Israel, Germany, the United
States and Britain conducted their research using the bank's own
microfilm records, the books of the defunct Reichsbank and files
from Degussa, which smelted the gold.
	   ``Gold played a deciding roll in financing the import of
strategic goods essential to the Nazi war efforts,'' the report
said.
	   ``The vast majority of the gold that Germany sold was stolen:
from central banks of vanquished countries, but also from
individuals, especially the victims of the Nazis' racist
persecution _ above all Jews.''
	   Given their connections and information available at the time,
Deutsche Bank officials ``could have known that the gold originally
belonged _ and ... still belongs _ to victims of Nazi Germany,''
the report concluded.
	   The report concludes that Deutsche Bank purchased 4,446
kilograms (4.9 tons) from the Nazi central bank during World War
II, and that at least 744 kilograms (1,637 pounds) of it stemmed
from Holocaust victims.
	   The 744 kilograms were linked through documents to gold looted
from Holocaust victims and collected by SS Capt. Bruno Melmer, the
historians said.
	   Trading most of the gold through its only overseas subsidiary,
in Istanbul, Turkey, the bank made a profit from 1941-43 of dlrs
378,000, or dlrs 3.4 million today. The historians said the profit
represented 0.15 percent of the bank's total profits during that
period.
	   Some of the gold, 323 kilograms (710 pounds), remained among
assets frozen into the 1950s in Switzerland at the request of the
Allies after the war, the report said.
	   That gold was sold in 1995. This March, the bank donated the
entire dlrs 3.1 million in proceeds to Jewish groups, saying it
suspected the gold may originally have been robbed from Jews.
	   Deutsche Bank released a brief statement Friday thanking the
historians for their work and saying the bank ``reaffirms its moral
responsibility for the darkest chapter in its history and deeply
regrets any injustices.''

UNHCR finds 500 people from Serb Malisevo attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with some people from town getting aid;
security concerns preventing widescale access, details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations has tracked down about
500 people, mostly women and children, who fled the Kosovo village
of Malisevo after Serb forces entered earlier this week, U.N.
officials said Friday.
	   The people were found Thursday huddled in groups of about 20 in
the woods above Malisevo near Mirusa, U.N. spokesman Juan Carlos
Brandt said. The groups, which included five newborn babies, had no
shelter or water and only the limited amount of food which they
carried with them when they fled, the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees said a statement.
	   The UNHCR was trying to organize a relief convoy to Mirusa, but
security concerns in the area were hampering efforts, said Kabra
Mbaidjol, the deputy director of UNHCR in New York.
	   ``The issue is security rather than access,'' he said.
	   U.N. workers had been able to provide only limited aid to
individuals from Malisevo, he said.
	   The refugees said there were thousands of people in the woods,
part of the estimated 65,000 in Malisevo before the Serbs entered
the town, UNHCR said. This figure includes 15,000 to 20,000 people
who had fled earlier from the town of Orahovac, the statement said.
	   ``The people there said they were afraid of going back to
Malisevo or anywhere else and spoke about hearing gunfire and
shellings during the past two nights,'' the statement said.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
people, and many want independence from Serbia, the largest of the
two republics that form Yugoslavia. But Serbs consider Kosovo the
cradle of their culture.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic told a European Union
delegation on Thursday that he had called off the weeklong
offensive in the province that forced thousands to flee their
homes.

	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Police have accused 10 people of
plotting subversive acts against the government, radio stations
reported Friday.
	   The alleged ringleader is Roger Cazeau, a former army colonel
who retired in 1983 and remains at large, police spokesman Felder
Jean-Baptiste said.
	   Jean-Baptiste said the accused were involved drug trafficking
and planned to use the proceeds to finance subversive acts.
	   Three police officers were injured, one seriously, when they
tried to defuse a grenade. Jean-Baptiste said the incident occurred
at Cazeau's house when police searched it, but Radio Metropole
previously reported the officers were injured during a separate
training exercise that had nothing to do with the search.
	   Cazeau, who is in hiding, denied the accusations against him.
	   ``With that accusation hanging over me, both my life and the
lives of my family are threatened,'' he told the private Radio
Vision 2000 in a telephone interview.
	   Others were skeptical of the accusations.
	   ``Every time the government is in difficulty, it attempts to
divert attention,'' said former interim police chief and 1995
presidential candidate Leon Jeune, in an interview with The
Associated Press on Friday.
	   Jeune was arrested Nov. 16, 1997 on subversion charges but
released a month later. In August 1996, some 20 former soldiers
were charged with plotting to overthrow the government but were
later released for lack of evidence.
	   Haiti has been without effective government since June 1997,
when Premier Rosny Smarth resigned to protest legislative elections
he said were tainted by fraud. Three attempts to nominate Smarth's
successor have been rejected by Parliament.
	   Meanwhile, international patience is wearing thin.
	   At the beginning of July, a U.S. congressional delegation warned
Haitian leaders that the U.S. Congress is inclined to cut all aid
if Haitians do not swiftly resolve the year-old power struggle.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Portugal will support East Timor's right
to self-determination at next week's U.N-brokered talks with
Indonesia over the disputed Southeast Asian territory, Foreign
Minister Jaime Gama said Friday.
	   But Gama said he would ``discuss the details'' of Jakarta's
recent proposal to grant limited autonomy to East Timor, where
rebels have been fighting for full independence since Indonesia
invaded 23 years ago.
	   ``The general principle for a solution of the East Timor problem
is international law and the resolutions of the United Nations
General Assembly. Naturally, self-determination is an essential
aspect in that context,'' Gama said.
	   Gama was speaking after a meeting of the Council of State, a
body of hand-picked advisers to President Jorge Sampaio.
	   The Council was summoned to discuss the East Timor issue prior
to Gama's talks with his Indonesian counterpart Ali Alataslks in
New York Aug. 4-5 under the auspices of U.N Secretary-General Kofi
Anna.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor during the civil war which erupted
in the half-island after the departure of Portugal's colonial
administration a few months earlier.
	   The United Nations regards Portugal as the legitimate
administering power of East Timor.
	   The New York meeting is the product of renewed efforts to
resolve the East Timor dispute since May's resignation of
Indonesian President Suharto.
	   Under the Indonesian plan, East Timor would be granted autonomy
except in foreign policy, external defense and certain monetary and
fiscal policies.
	   On Tuesday, the Indonesian army began a gradual withdrawal of
troops from East Timor, fulfilling a pledge by Suharto's
replacement President B.J. Habibie.
	   But Jose Ramos Horta, a leading East Timorese independence
activist and co-winner of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize, said Friday
that he had ``no great expectations'' for the talks.
	   ``We haven't seen any serious signs of good faith,'' he said in
Lisbon, accusing Indonesia of sending in 800 new troops under the
guise of being doctors and civil servants.
	   He also called on Portugal to remain firm in its support of the
rebels' demand for a referendum on self-rule for the East Timorese.
	   Human rights organizations have accused the Indonesian military
of widespread abuses, including torture and executions, in East
Timor.
	   Alatas has said this would be likely to lead to renewed civil
war.

Opposition leader arrested in Mexico
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) _ A state opposition party official has
been arrested on a charge of plundering property in Guerrero, a
state where several other members of his leftist party have been
detained in recent months.
	   State police arrested David Molina Francisco on Thursday in
Coyuca de Benitez. Authorities said he built housing on a public
basketball court.
	   Molina is president of the state council of the Democratic
Revolution Party, known as the PRD, and a party leader in Coyuca de
Benitez, 20 miles (30 kilometers) northwest of Acapulco.
	   Leaders of the state government, controlled by the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party, previously accused Molina of
involvement in the Popular Revolutionary Army.
	   That leftist rebel group first appeared in a village of the
Coyuca de Benitez district in July 1996 during a memorial service
for 17 members of a peasant organization who had been ambushed and
killed by state police.
	   The PRD is one of Mexico's three major parties and is the
governing party's main rival in Guerrero.
	   PRD state president Octaviano Santiago Dionisio accused Gov.
Angel Aguirre Rivero of harassing and persecuting social activists
such as Molina, who is a university professor.
	   State officials have recently arrested activists from several
PRD-linked peasant organizations, claiming they were tied to the
rebels _ a claim the groups and those arrested have denied.
	   PRD leaders last week reported that one activist, Alfredo
Barragan, had been kidnapped by gunmen at a rally in Guerrero.
State police denied knowing anything about him for two days _ then
turned him over to a prison. Officials charged him with
embezzlement and claimed he was a rebel.
	   Barragan said he was tortured.
	   The PRD also claims that scores of its activists in Guerrero
have died in political violence over the past decade. Officials say
the incidents were common crimes, not political ones.
	   Molina was taken to a jail in Acapulco, where the PRD's state
human rights secretary is being held on charges of blocking roads
during protests, the daily Reforma reported.

U.S. presses Milosevic to allow aid flow into Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Albanians saying 30 refugees
crossed border from Junik area; UN to organize relief convoy &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic gave his personal assurance Friday that relief workers
can deliver aid to thousands of Kosovo Albanians who fled into the
hills to escape a major government offensive, a U.S. envoy said.
	   The envoy, Christopher Hill, told reporters that Milosevic
promised he would take ``personal responsibility'' for allowing aid
workers access to refugees.
	   Hill said the Yugoslav president also agreed to allow
international monitors to escort the civilians back home to avoid
intimidation by local authorities.
	   In New York, a senior U.N. relief official, Kabra Mbaidjol, said
the United Nations was trying to organize a relief convoy to
refugees who fled the fighting but ``security rather than access''
was the main obstacle.
	   Hill arrived here in the Kosovo provincial capital Friday
following a two-hour meeting with Milosevic in Belgrade. Hill said
Milosevic repeated his promise _ made to European Union delegation
Thursday _ that the week-long Serb offensive against the Kosovo
Liberation Army was over.
	   Serb forces drove the KLA from several key strongholds during
the operation.
	   Despite the pledge, scattered clashes were reported by both Serb
and ethnic Albanian sources Friday. The government's Tanjug news
agency said eight ethnic Albanian ``terrorists'' were killed and
several were arrested Friday when they attacked Serb police near
Lipljane, some 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of Pristina.
	   Three Serb policemen were seriously wounded, the report said.
	   In neighboring Albania, Interior Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga
said about 30 refugees _ mostly women and children _ fled across
the border Friday from the area of Junik, which has been reported
under government siege.
	   The ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center said seven people
had been killed in Junik from Serb shelling since the siege began.
Several others had been injured and houses had been destroyed, the
center said.
	   A KLA spokesman, in a statement broadcast Friday by Albanian
state television, expressed disappointment that the world had not
reacted more strongly to the Serb offensive.
	   ``The Kosovo Liberation Army will be more strong and more
professional than it is now,'' the spokesman, Jakup Krasniqi, said.
``The Serbian offensive can never bring the KLA to its knees. We
will fight the Serbian vandals until our victory so long as we have
breath.''
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
people, and many want independence from Serbia, largest of the two
republics that form Yugoslavia.
	   Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, has been spearheading
international efforts to arrange peace talks between Milosevic and
leaders of the ethnic Albanian community.
	   The KLA has been resisting international calls to unite behind
moderate Albanian politician Ibrahim Rugova, who opposes violence.
But diplomats hoped Serb gains during the offensive might make the
rebels more amenable to a negotiated settlement.
	   On Wednesday, Hill met with KLA representatives and said they
showed interest for the first time in endorsing the idea of a joint
Albanian delegation.
	   An Albanian source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The
Associated Press that the rebels asked Hill for a week to decide
whether to accept the negotiating team.
	   Meanwhile, aid workers searched the rugged hills around sites of
recent fighting in hopes of locating an estimated 20,000 people _
mostly Albanians _ displaced by the Serb offensive.
	   Some aid teams complained they had been turned back by Serb
police.
	   The search for missing civilians intensified after teams from
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees found at least
500 terrified ethnic Albanians hiding Thursday in the rugged hills
near Malisevo, which the KLA abandoned two days before.
	   Maki Shinohara, a UNHCR official, said the Albanians had little
food and no water and were fearful Serb police would hunt them
down. She said the refugee agency would try to ship them food and
supplies.
	   ``They're sleeping under the trees,'' another UNHCR official,
Tom Vargas, told CNN-International. ``A large number of women,
children and elderly are among them.''
	   In Geneva, UNHCR spokesman Kris Janowski said at least 100,000
people had been displaced since Milosevic launched a crackdown on
Albanian militants in February.
	   The United States and the Europeans reject independence for
Kosovo, fearing it would lead to similar demands among
Albanian-speaking communities elsewhere in the southern Balkans.

 &UR; EDS: Adds Costa beating DeWulf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KITZBUEHEL, Austria (AP) _ Spain's Francisco Clavet and Italy's
Andrea Gaudenzi won quarterfinal matches Friday as heavy rain and
wind slowed play at the Generali Open.
	   Clavet rolled past Brazil's Fernando Meligeni, 6-3, 6-1, and
will face Gaudenzi in Saturday's semifinals at the dlrs 535,000
event.
	   Gaudenzi advanced with a 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) victory over Ecuador
player Nicolas Lapentti, who stunned second-seeded Yevgeny
Kafelnikov in straight sets Thursday.
	   Clavet, seeded sixth, has yielded just 15 games in his three
matches and become a favorite to win his first title since Bogota
last year.
	   ``I can't say I'll win, but I'm playing very good tennis,'' said
the Spaniard, 29. ``I hardly made any unforced errors today.''
	   Clavet dominated the match against Meligeni, who reached the
round of 16 at the French Open, although strong wind affected his
baseline game.
	   Top-seeded Marcelo Rios pulled out with an injury while the rest
of the top five seeds have been beaten except No. 3 Albert Costa of
Spain.
	   Costa ousted defending champion Filip DeWulf of Belgium, 2-6,
6-3, 6-4, rallying after downpours stopped the match for over two
hours.
	   Australia's eighth-seeded Richard Fromberg was pitted against
Argentinian Franco Squillari in the final quarterfinal match to be
played later Friday.

U.S., Lithuania, Yugoslavia roll; Nigerian tests positive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Australia, Italy victories. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Jason Sasser led a balanced offense with
17 points as the United States rebounded from its first loss since
1990 at a major tournament and routed South Korea 88-62 Friday to
reach the second round at the World Basketball Championship.
	   Lithuania, which struggled one day after its upset of the
Americans, and Yugoslavia both won Friday to stay unbeaten, while
Russia and Italy also advanced with victories.
	   Australia scraped into the next round by holding off Nigeria
70-64 behind 24 points from Shane Heal, who used to play for the
Minnesota Timberwolves, and 20 from Seton Hall product Andrew Gaze.
	   Dallas Mavericks center Chris Anstey, the only NBA player at the
worlds, contributed 13 points and 9 rebounds.
	   Nigeria (0-3) played without center Julius Nwosu, who was
suspended from the tournament earlier Friday by FIBA because he
tested positive for the banned substance ephedrine. Nwosu, who had
a brief pro career in the NBA and CBA, was tested after Nigeria's
loss to Spain on Wednesday, the event's opening day.
	   The mostly anonymous U.S. team (2-1), drawn largely from the CBA
and European leagues, started slowly against South Korea and led
44-34 at halftime.
	   With South Korea content to launch one 3-point shot after
another _ the team shot 12-for-36 from behind the arc, 10 more
attempts than from inside _ the non-Dream Teamers managed to pull
away in the second half.
	   The United States held a 46-24 rebounding edge and were much
more aggressive than in Thursday's 84-82 loss to Lithuania. Former
Syracuse star Wendell Alexis chipped in with 13 points, as did
Jimmy King of Michigan Fab Five fame.
	   ``That game yesterday got away from us. We knew it was South
Korea today and maybe they're not the strongest team,'' said Jimmy
Oliver, who had 11 points, ``but we didn't want to let this one
go.''
	   The Americans finish second in Group C, behind Lithuania and
ahead of Brazil.
	   Lithuania trailed by as many as 14 points in the first half
against Brazil (1-2) but rallied late to win 66-62. Seton Hall
product Arturas Karnisovas poured in 20 points, Saulius Sombergas
added 18, and Darius Lukminas hit two key 3-pointer down the
stretch.
	   ``We won today so I can't say we're tired mentally. But playing
like we did yesterday and then staying up until 3:00 in the morning
to watch the game on television tired us physically,'' Lithuanian
coach Jonas Kazlauskas said. ``We spent a lot of emotion.''
	   His country, which won the bronze at the last two Olympics, will
play Australia (1-2, third in Group D) when action resumes Sunday
with the second round. The United States will play either Argentina
or Spain.
	   The top three from each group advance to the round-robin second
round, forming two new six-team brackets. Four countries from each
will move on to the quarterfinals.
	   European champion Yugoslavia clinched Group B by routing winless
Japan 99-54 as Sasha Obradovic and Dragan Lukovsi had 18 points
apiece. The 1990 world titlists hit 14-of-22 shots from behind the
3-point line.
	   Russia (2-1) finished second in the group by defeating Puerto
Rico 86-73 behind Vassily Karassev's 17 points.
	   Puerto Rico (1-2) led 54-45 with 15:21 left in the game, but
scored just one field goal over the final seven minutes and Russia
used a 15-2 run to take the lead for good.
	   Veteran center Jose Ortiz led Puerto Rico with 18 points and 15
rebounds before fouling out.
	   Italy improved to 2-1 in Group A by defeating Canada 79-69.
Italy's top player, Carlton Myers, played for the first time at the
tournament. The guard, who was sidelined by a fever and sore
throat, scored 11 points in 24 minutes of action.

Lisbon backs East Timor self-determination, will discuss limited
</HEADLINE>
autonomy &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC;

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Portugal will support East Timor's right
to self-determination at next week's U.N-brokered talks with
Indonesia, Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said Friday.
	   But Gama said he would ``discuss the details'' of Jakarta's
recent proposal to grant limited autonomy to the disputed Southeast
Asian territory, where rebels have been fighting for full
independence since Indonesia invaded 23 years ago.
	   ``The general principle for a solution of the East Timor problem
is international law and the resolutions of the United Nations
General Assembly. Naturally, self-determination is an essential
aspect in that context,'' Gama said.
	   Gama was speaking after a meeting of the Council of State, a
body of hand-picked advisers to President Jorge Sampaio.
	   The Council was summoned to discuss the East Timor issue prior
to Gama's talks with his Indonesian counterpart Ali Alataslks in
New York Aug. 4-5 under the auspices of U.N Secretary-General Kofi
Anna.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor during the civil war which erupted
after the departure of Portugal's colonial administration a few
months earlier.
	   The United Nations regards Portugal as the legitimate
administering power of East Timor, a territory covering half of an
island.
	   The New York meeting is the product of renewed efforts to
resolve the East Timor dispute since May's resignation of
Indonesian President Suharto.
	   Under the Indonesian plan, East Timor would be granted autonomy
except in foreign policy, external defense and certain monetary and
fiscal policies.
	   On Tuesday, the Indonesian army began a gradual withdrawal of
troops from East Timor, fulfilling a pledge by Suharto's
replacement President B.J. Habibie.
	   But Jose Ramos Horta, a leading East Timorese independence
activist and co-winner of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize, said Friday
that he had ``no great expectations'' for the talks.
	   ``We haven't seen any serious signs of good faith,'' he said in
Lisbon, accusing Indonesia of sending in 800 new troops under the
guise of being doctors and civil servants.
	   He also called on Portugal to remain firm in its support of the
rebels' demand for a referendum on self-rule for the East Timorese.
	   Human rights organizations have accused the Indonesian military
of widespread abuses, including torture and executions, in East
Timor.

Legislator dies of heat stroke in southern Egypt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASSIUT, Egypt (AP) _ A member of Egypt's parliament died of heat
stroke in the southern Egyptian town of Dairut, hospital officials
said Friday.
	   Hospitals in the local province of Assiut are on alert for a
wave of heat-related illnesses.
	   Temperatures in Dairut, 179 miles (286 kilometers) south of
Cairo, topped 108 Fahrenheit (42 Celsius) on Friday. They have
hovered around the 100-degrees mark (38 Celcius) for over two weeks
through most of Egypt.
	   Hosam Kilani, 55, Dairut's representative in the People's
Assembly, had just finished a tour of the villages in his
constituency when he collapsed at his home, a hospital official
said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   He was rushed to hospital where he died of heat stroke.
	   The official said Assiut hospitals were ordered to prepare for a
spate of heat-wave casualties.
	   It was not immediately possible to determine the number of
heat-stroke victims admitted to hospitals in southern Egypt, where
most of the population is employed in agriculture and many homes
and offices lack air-conditioning.

	   LILLE, France (AP) _ French authorities probing drug use during
the Tour de France placed Italian rider Rodolfo Massi under formal
investigation Friday, one step short of charging him.
	   It was the first time in the probe that authorities had taken
such action against a rider in the three-week competition that ends
in Paris Sunday.
	   Along with Massi, of the Casino team, Dr. Nicolas Terrados
Cepada of the Spanish team Once, was also placed under formal
investigation in this northern French city.
	   Altogether, five people have been placed under formal
investigation in the scandal. The other three are: Festina team
director Bruno Roussel, trainer Willy Voet and the team's Belgian
doctor Eric Ryckaert, who remained in custody.
	   Massi and Terrados were placed under formal investigation for
allegedly breaking a 1989 law against doping during sports
competitions. They were later released on bail of 50,000 francs
(dlrs 8,300) and 100,000 francs (dlrs 16,600), respectively.
	   Massi's lawyer, Eric Dupont-Moretti, criticized officials for
``not having waited for the end of the Tour de France to question
him.''
	   Authorities requested that Massi find a residence in France
within a month, pending the results of the investigation.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic gave his personal assurance Friday that relief workers
can deliver aid to thousands of Kosovo Albanians who fled into the
hills to escape a major government offensive, a U.S. envoy said.
	   The envoy, Christopher Hill, said Milosevic promised that he
would take ``personal responsibility'' for allowing aid workers
access to refugees.
	   Hill said the Yugoslav president also agreed to allow
international monitors to escort the civilians home to avoid
intimidation by local authorities.
	   In New York, a senior U.N. relief official, Kabra Mbaidjol, said
the United Nations was trying to organize a relief convoy to
refugees who fled the fighting but ``security rather than access''
was the main obstacle.

American Julich looks toward podium; one more team quits

	   AUTUN, France (AP) _ Safely in second place as the Tour de
France arrived Friday in the wine country of Burgundy, Bobby Julich
was thinking ahead to another appealing locale: the winner's podium
on the Champs-Elysees.
	   That's where the American plans to be standing on Sunday, when
the drug scandal-plagued tour, which lost another team Friday,
staggers into Paris for its not-so-grand finale.
	   Hopefully, Julich says, he'll be on the podium's second step _
one above last year's winner, Jan Ullrich, now in third.
	   ``Those 14 seconds are very, very important,'' Julich said of
the gap between him and Ullrich after Friday's 19th stage. ``I
expect a big battle for second.''
	   And as for catching Marco Pantani, the current leader by a huge
five minutes and 42 seconds?
	   ``That's a dream,'' said Julich, of Glenwood Springs, Colorado,
who rides for the Cofidis team. ``It would be very difficult to
overcome that deficit.
	   ``I'll try, though.''
	   The standings of the top three didn't change Friday, as the
riders ended a brief trip into Switzerland for a fast 242-kilometer
(151.3-mile) ride to Autun, in Burgundy.
	   After an early breakaway by 13 riders, Sweden's Magnus Backstedt
won the stage in a final sprint. Maarten Den Bakker of the
Netherlands came in second, and Italy's Eddy Mazzoleni was third.
	   But there was still no respite from the doping scandal that has
enveloped the Tour. The latest to withdraw was the Dutch team TVM,
one of two teams at the very center of the scandal.
	   ``They are neither physically nor mentally capable of finishing
this Tour de France,'' said Tour director Jean-Marie Leblanc,
reading a team statement.
	   Only 14 of the original 21 teams are still in the race. Six have
pulled out in anger at police tactics, and one, Festina, was
expelled on July 17 after its officials admitted to systematic
doping.
	   More legal action in the drug probe came Friday when authorities
placed Italian rider Rodolfo Massi under formal investigation, one
step short of charging him, along with Dr. Nicolas Terrados Cepada
of the Spanish team Once.
	   It was the first time in the probe that authorities had taken
such action against a rider. Altogether, five people have been
placed under formal investigation.
	   Police treatment of the TVM team Tuesday night sparked the
riders' unprecedented protest the following day, leading to the
annulment of the 17th stage.

Ethnic Albanian rebels weigh deal for talks team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNE THOMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian rebels have asked
U.S. diplomats for time to review a proposal to join politicians in
negotiations with the Serb-led government on the future of Kosovo
province, a leading politician said Friday.
	   Mehmet Hajrizi, who this week accompanied U.S. envoy Christopher
Hill to a meeting with the Kosovo Liberation Army, said the rebel
group would reveal next week whether it will enter a coalition with
ethnic Albanian politicians.
	   A team for negotiations with the Serbs would be drawn from the
coalition.
	   The development follows weeks of diplomatic machinations aimed
at getting Albanian factions to cooperate with each other toward
starting talks and reaching a cease-fire in the war for control of
Kosovo.
	   Albanians _ who outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in the province of 2
million people _ want independence. President Slobodan Milosevic
has staged a brutal military push to keep Kosovo in Serbia, the
republic that makes up most of Yugoslavia. The five-month conflict
has killed at least hundreds of people and driven an estimated
130,000 ethnic Albanian civilians from their homes.
	   The details of the negotiating plan were not resolved, and there
was doubt as to whether Milosevic actually would permit it. ``The
only thing I believe is what happens on the ground,'' a Western
diplomat close to the negotiations said Friday on condition of
anonymity. ``And I think that's a very good rule of thumb in the
Balkans.''
	   Speaking with reporters here Friday, Hill said the Yugoslav
leader assured him he was ``most interested'' in starting peace
talks soon and that he would do nothing to stop the Albanians from
putting together a negotiating team.
	   The intricate web of Albanian factions has been a major block
toward starting talks with the Serbs. While all sides share a goal
for independence, opposing camps among rebels and politicians have
foiled diplomats struggling to unite Albanians in a group that
could enter negotiations.
	   Hard-line guerrillas reject the pacifist stance of ethnic
Albanian political leader Ibrahim Rugova, while another KLA faction
calls Rugova its leader. Politicians such as Hajrizi, once allied
with Rugova, have in recent months denounced him as ineffective and
formed their own parties.
	   Complicating the mix even further is the apparent difficulty in
identifying who truly represents the Kosovo Liberation Army, a
secretive band whose members numbering anywhere from 20,000 to
50,000 hide in hills and villages scattered around the province.
	   Other KLA members and claimed leaders are in Albania, Germany
and Switzerland, from where they channel money and weapons to the
fighters back home.
	   KLA member Jakup Krasniqi, who claims to represent for the
group, told Albanian reporters this week that Hajrizi could not
speak for the KLA _ despite the politician's role in meetings
between Hill and the rebels.
	   Instead, Krasniqi said the only KLA member authorized to make
foreign contacts was Mahmuti Bardhyl, the Swiss-based spokesman for
the rebel group's Western European wing. Diplomats say they are not
working with KLA members outside Kosovo, arguing that these rebels
are too removed from the fighting.
	   Hajrizi, the leader of the Albanian Democratic Movement, said he
is currently in contact by telephone with the rebels two or three
times a day. He dismissed speculation that the KLA was cowed by
Milosevic's recent offensive, which drove the rebels from their
headquarters and from two strategic roads.
	   ``They don't consider this a defeat and they've had very flew
losses,'' the politician said. ``We can see in their faces they are
absolutely sure of themselves.''
	   Hajrizi also said the KLA was prepared to sit down for talks
with the Serbs providing that Milosevic withdraws military forces
from the province and that international monitors participate in
negotiations.
	   But Western diplomats said it was unlikely that ethnic Albanians
and Serbs would meet face to face any time soon, and the U.S.-led
shuttle diplomacy between the two sides could continue for weeks if
not months.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Sally Becker, a British aid worker
imprisoned by the Serbs in embattled Kosovo province, was released
and deported Friday, diplomats and the state-run media said.
	   Ms. Becker was arrested July 16 and sentenced to 30 days in
prison for illegally crossing the Albanian-Yugoslav border while
trying to help Kosovo refugees.
	   She was released Friday and deported to neighboring Macedonia,
where she caught a flight for Britain, according to diplomats who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The Serbian state-run TV confirmed Becker was released. The
official Tanjug news agency said she was banned from returning to
Serb-led Yugoslavia.
	   On July 23, Ms. Becker announced that she had stopped eating and
drinking in her prison cell in Lipljane, 20 kilometers (12 miles)
south of Kosovo's capital Pristina, to protest innocent victims of
the fighting in the Serbian province.
	   She briefly fell unconscious Monday after five days of hunger
strike, and had an intravenous fluid attached by Serbian doctors.
	   She is known as the Angel of Mostar for her humanitarian efforts
in that Bosnian city during the 3 1/2 war.

Public exploration of apartheid's horrors ends

 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES South Africa-Chemical Warfare &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ An extraordinary public
exploration into the decades of massacres, beatings and torture
that marked South Africa's apartheid-era ended Friday after two
years of often painful testimony .
	   Before closing its hearings into human rights abuses committed
during the years of white minority rule, the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission heard from one final witness, a man
dubbed ``Dr. Death'' by the local media.
	   Wouter Basson, who headed a secret program to devise chemical
and biological weapons aimed at South Africa's blacks, countered on
Friday many of the charges leveled against him.
	   Scientists in June testified about poisoning shirts and
chocolates, trying to poison President Nelson Mandela, who spent 27
years as a prisoner of the white-run state and searching for a
bacteria that would affect only blacks.
	   Basson denied trying to kill Mandela, saying he helped protect
him from a plot by radicals in the African National Congress who
thought their imprisoned leader too moderate.
	   Basson also denied telling his scientists to develop ways to
reduce black women's fertility or to find a bacteria that would
kill only black people.
	   Seeking to implicate the United States and other countries, he
said the West shared military secrets with him about chemical and
germ warfare. In exchange, he provided information on the chemical
warfare capability of Soviet-backed countries neighboring South
Africa.
	   Basson's testimony capped two years of hearings in which the
panel, headed by retired Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu summoned
up some of the most divisive episodes of apartheid's past: the
death of activist Steve Biko, murders and assaults laid at the door
of Nelson Mandela's ex-wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, the actions
of police death squads and the torture of black activists.
	   Dozens of secret burial sites were found when former security
officers led panel members through dusty fields and identified
bodies in shallow graves.
	   Police assassin Eugene De Kock, who was so ruthless his men
nicknamed him ``Prime Evil,'' testified that torture and murder by
the state security forces had become commonplace.
	   Tutu was overcome by emotion at times and buried his head in his
arms and wept.
	   ``I wasn't sure I was the right person for the job,'' Tutu told
SABC radio Friday. ``I asked myself, `How did so many of us
survive?' ''
	   The panel heard from 21,000 witnesses. It now will write a
report due in October that is designed to bring reconciliation and
racial healing through a reckoning with the past.
	   A separate committee will continue to hear amnesty applications.
	   The question of who gave the orders has dogged the commission
hearings throughout.
	   Former President P.W. Botha, the last hard-line apartheid
leader, has refused to appear. But in an amnesty hearing, a former
law and order minister said Botha gave the orders to bomb the
building housing the anti-apartheid South African Council of
Churches.
	   Botha has denied the charge.
	   The commission hearings have been a painful experience for South
Africans. A newspaper survey this week found that most believed
they have been more divisive than reconciling.
	   ``We were asked to provide as big a picture of gross human
rights violations'' as possible, Tutu told SABC television this
week.
	   ``If you uncover the ghastly atrocities that took place ... it
would be very odd if people said, `Oh it's wonderful.' But the
truth is quite crucial to the process of reconciliation,'' the
Nobel Peace Prize winner said.

Few U.S. students leave St. Kitts after threat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASSETERRE, St. Kitts (AP) _ Some U.S. students left St. Kitts
Friday after the State Department reported that an accused drug
trafficker had threatened to kill Americans if he were extradited.
	   But the chairman and founder of Ross University said only ``a
small number'' of students had left and classes were continuing as
normal.
	   ``There is no immediate threat, but we had to inform the
students'' of the Stated Department report, Dr. Robert Ross said
Friday.
	   The State Department said Thursday it had received information
that Charles Miller, also known as ``Little Nut,'' had threatened
to kill U.S. students at random if he were extradited to the United
States to face drug trafficking charges.
	   The extradition is currently being considered by the courts in
St. Kitts. The United States has been seeking the extradition of
Miller, 37, and other suspects for trial, since 1996.
	   ``The statement from the State Department says nothing is
imminent,'' said Ross. ``Nothing is going to happen unless he is
extradited.''
	   Nearly 300 students and more than 50 faculty members, almost all
U.S. citizens, are at the Ross University veterinary school on St.
Kitts, an island in the eastern Caribbean.
	   ``The operation of the university is is as usual,'' said Ross.
``Classes are being attended to. Finals are in two weeks.''
	   Students who wanted to leave would be allowed to take their
finals in September, Ross said.
	   The office of the prime minister in St. Kitts issued a statement
saying the government would ``use all its resources, including the
police and the defense forces,'' to protect the university.
	   Ross said additional university security personnel were added,
St. Kitts police officers were on the campus and security officers
from U.S. embassies in the region were also present.

U.S., Lithuania, Yugoslavia roll; Nigerian tests positive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, reorganizes. will be updated with late games. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC;

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Lithuania suffered lapses while Yugoslavia
dominated from the start, but both picked up victories Friday at
the World Basketball Championships to remain undefeated and advance
to the second round.
	   Lithuania beat Brazil 66-62 and Yugoslavia routed Japan 99-54.
	   Jason Sasser led a balanced offense with 17 points as the United
States rebounded from its first loss since 1990 at a major
tournament and routed South Korea 88-62.
	   Russia and Italy also advanced with victories.
	   Australia scraped into the next round by holding off Nigeria
70-64 behind 24 points from Shane Heal, who used to play for the
Minnesota Timberwolves, and 20 from Seton Hall product Andrew Gaze.
	   Dallas Mavericks center Chris Anstey, the only NBA player at the
worlds, contributed 13 points and 9 rebounds.
	   Nigeria (0-3) played without center Julius Nwosu, who was
suspended from the tournament earlier Friday by FIBA because he
tested positive for the banned substance ephedrine. Nwosu, who had
a brief pro career in the NBA and minor-league Continental
Basketball Association, was tested after Nigeria's loss to Spain on
Wednesday, the event's opening day.
	   A day after its historic win over the United States, Lithuania
trailed by as many as 14 points in the first half against Brazil
(1-2) but rallied late. Seton Hall product Arturas Karnisovas
poured in 20 points, Saulius Sombergas added 18, and Darius
Lukminas hit two key 3-pointer down the stretch.
	   ``We won today so I can't say we're tired mentally. But playing
like we did yesterday and then staying up until 3:00 in the morning
to watch the game on television tired us physically,'' Lithuanian
coach Jonas Kazlauskas said. ``We spent a lot of emotion.''
	   His country, which won the bronze at the last two Olympics, will
play Australia (1-2, third in Group D) when action resumes Sunday
with the second round. The United States will play either Argentina
or Spain.
	   The top three from each group advance to the round-robin second
round, forming two new six-team brackets. Four countries from each
will move on to the quarterfinals.
	   European champion Yugoslavia clinched Group B as Sasha Obradovic
and Dragan Lukovsi had 18 points apiece against Japan. The 1990
world titlists hit 14-of-22 shots from behind the 3-point line.
	   ``We played really well from the very beginning and were able to
take an immediate lead,'' center Zeljiko Rebraca said.
	   The mostly anonymous U.S. team (2-1), drawn largely from the CBA
and European leagues, started slowly against South Korea and led
44-34 at halftime.
	   With South Korea content to launch one 3-point shot after
another _ the team shot 12-for-36 from behind the arc, 10 more
attempts than from inside _ the non-Dream Teamers managed to pull
away in the second half.
	   The United States held a 46-24 rebounding edge and were much
more aggressive than in Thursday's 84-82 loss to Lithuania. Former
Syracuse star Wendell Alexis chipped in with 13 points, as did
Jimmy King of Michigan Fab Five fame.
	   ``That game yesterday got away from us. We knew it was South
Korea today and maybe they're not the strongest team,'' said Jimmy
Oliver, who had 11 points, ``but we didn't want to let this one
go.''
	   The Americans finish second in Group C, behind Lithuania and
ahead of Brazil.
	   Russia (2-1) finished second in Group B by defeating Puerto Rico
86-73 behind Vassily Karassev's 17 points.
	   Puerto Rico (1-2) led 54-45 with 15:21 left in the game, but
scored just one field goal over the final seven minutes and Russia
used a 15-2 run to take the lead for good.
	   Veteran center Jose Ortiz led Puerto Rico with 18 points and 15
rebounds before fouling out.
	   Italy improved to 2-1 in Group A by defeating Canada 79-69.
Italy's top player, Carlton Myers, played for the first time at the
tournament. The guard, who was sidelined by a fever and sore
throat, scored 11 points in 24 minutes of action.

Ex-soccer club head investigated for financial wrongdoing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French businessman Alain Afflelou was placed Friday
under formal investigation -- one step short of being charged --
for allegedly misusing millions of francs (dollars) for the
Bordeaux soccer team he once headed.
	   It was the latest financial scandal involving the sport in
France, where other businessmen have faced legal action over how
they ran their teams.
	   Afflelou, who owns an upscale chain of eyeglass shops and was
president of the Bordeaux club from 1991-96, was released after
being placed under investigation.
	   Investigative Judge Laurence Vichnievski questioned Afflelou
about his relationship with the Franco-Italian bank, Fondo Sociale
di Cooperazione Europea, where Afflelou invested 49 million francs
(dlrs 8 million.)
	   Police were investigating whether funds from the bank were
illegally used to buy players and other activities.
	   The judge was also looking into a 5 million-franc (dlrs 830,000)
loan by the bank to France's Republican Party, investigators said
on customary anonymity.
	   Vichnievski has already placed several other people under formal
investigation, including the bank's president, Guy Gennesseaux.
	   French soccer has been rocked by several financial scandals in
recent years.
	   In April, Francis Borelli, former president of Paris-Saint
Germain, was given a 15-month suspended jail sentence and fined
100,000 francs (dlrs 16,700) for irregularities during his reign at
the soccer giant.
	   In the early 1990's, former Olympique Marseille president
Bernard Tapie was at the center of a series of match-fixing
scandals.

Israeli air raid after bomb kills Israeli-allied militiaman
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Israeli air raid; no pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli planes fired rockets at
guerrilla routes in southern Lebanon Friday, hours after a roadside
bomb killed a pro-Israeli militiaman, Lebanese security officials
said.
	   At least two Israeli fighter-bombers fired a total of four
missiles at guerrilla infiltration paths in a valley near Jezzine
in the Israeli-occupied zone, the officials said.
	   Less than three hours before the raid, a roadside bomb,
apparently detonated by remote control, went off on a road outside
Jezzine as a pickup truck was passing.
	   The driver, Nabil Iskandar, a member of the South Lebanon Army
militia, was killed instantly and his sister Salam, 12, who was
sitting next to him, was wounded, the officials said.
	   Salam is being treated at a nearby hospital.
	   Jezzine is 20 kilometers (13 miles) north of Marjayoun, the main
town in the Israeli-occupied sector. It is run by the
Israeli-backed SLA, a local militia of 2,500 which maintains the
zone with 1,500 Israeli soldiers. Israel set up the zone in 1985 to
protect its northern territory from guerrilla attacks.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the roadside
bombing. But the attack bore the hallmarks of the Hezbollah
movement, whose guerrillas have frequently used such bombs in their
campaign to oust Israeli soldiers and the SLA from the zone.
	   On Thursday, one Israeli soldier was killed and five others were
wounded in an ambush by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah.

Sierra Leone army brass fingered for 1997 coup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Prosecutors opened their case
Friday against 38 military officers accused of launching a bloody
coup that toppled Sierra Leone's President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah in
May last year.
	   The accused were being court-martialled in a Freetown courthouse
on charges of treason and mutiny. If found guilty, they face death
by firing squad, a sentence that in a Sierra Leonean court-martial
cannot be appealed.
	   Each of the accused pleaded innocent as the proceedings opened.
	   The first prosecution witness, state radio technician Leslie
During, described how armed soldiers led by some of those on trial
captured the state broadcasting station in the capital of Freetown
on May 25, 1997 after surrounding the facility with military Land
Rovers.
	   The soldiers went on air to announce the coup, which forced
Kabbah into exile until March, when a West African intervention
force known as ECOMOG ousted the coup leaders and their followers
from Freetown.
	   Among those being tried are Col. F.Y. Koroma, the brother of
junta leader Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma, who has gone into hiding
with other members of his forces.
	   The military court trials are separate from a hunt for junta
collaborators that have led to at least 58 treason charges earlier
this year against government officials, journalists and some
prominent Freetown citizens.
	   More than 200 people are being investigated by Kabbah's
government for alleged ties to Koroma's junta.
	   Although Kabbah's return was hailed as a victory for democracy
in West Africa, fighting between the coalition army and ousted
junta fighters has continued in the country's east.
	   The court-martial is expected to continue for several weeks.

Nigerian tests positive at World Championship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Nwosu quotes.

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Nigerian center Julius Nwosu, who had a
brief pro career in the United States, was suspended Friday from
the World Basketball Championship after testing positive for the
banned substance ephedrine, FIBA officials announced.
	   The sport's world governing body said in a brief statement that
Nwosu had been suspended but did not specify for how long.
	   He was on the bench, in street clothes, for Nigeria's game
against Australia later Friday.
	   ``That's FIBA, you can't fight FIBA,'' Nwosu told The Associated
Press at halftime of the game. ``I'm always clean. It's just been
blown out of proportion.''
	   He said he thinks the positive sample, taken after Nigeria's
80-68 loss to Spain on Wednesday, resulted because he is taking a
vitamin supplement called Up The Gas.
	   ``I have a knee injury and so the solution is either to drink a
lot of milk or take the vitamins,'' he said.
	   FIBA said Nwosu's A-sample contained ``an abnormally high
level'' of ephedrine, which is classed as a stimulant and is
typically found in cold medications. Its use normally carries a
warning or a ban of three months or fewer.
	   Nigeria's games at the two-week tournament are not subject to
forfeit, FIBA said.
	   Nwosu, 27, has had short stints in the CBA and NBA and played
last season with Galatasaray in the Turkish League.
	   The 2.06-meter (6-foot-10) player was suspended indefinitely by
the Connecticut Pride of the CBA in January for conduct detrimental
to the team. He also was briefly with the NBA's San Antonio Spurs
and Boston Celtics.
	   ``I'm not really interested in going back to the NBA. I didn't
like it,'' he said, adding that he is looking for a contract with a
European team.
	   FIBA said only one other player had tested positive at a world
championship. Egypt's Mohammed Ashraf was banned for two years
after failing a doping test at the 1994 tournament.
	   The world of sports has been rocked in recent days by a series
of doping scandals, including in the Tour de France, track and
field and swimming.

Ethnic Albanian rebels weigh deal for talks team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNE THOMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian rebels have asked
U.S. diplomats for time to review a proposal to join negotiations
with the Serb-led government on the future of Kosovo province, a
leading politician said Friday.
	   Mehmet Hajrizi, who this week accompanied U.S. envoy Christopher
Hill to a meeting with the Kosovo Liberation Army, said the rebel
group would reveal next week whether it will enter the talks with a
coalition of ethnic Albanian politicians.
	   A negotiation team would be drawn from the coalition to meet
with the Serbs.
	   The development follows weeks of diplomatic machinations aimed
at getting Albanian factions to cooperate with each other toward
starting talks and reaching a cease-fire in the war for control of
Kosovo.
	   Albanians _ who outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in the province of 2
million people _ want independence. President Slobodan Milosevic
has staged a brutal military push to keep Kosovo in Serbia, the
republic that makes up most of Yugoslavia. The five-month conflict
has killed hundreds of people and driven an estimated 130,000
ethnic Albanian civilians from their homes.
	   The details of the negotiating plan were not resolved, and there
was doubt as to whether Milosevic actually would permit it. ``The
only thing I believe is what happens on the ground,'' a Western
diplomat close to the negotiations said Friday on condition of
anonymity. ``And I think that's a very good rule of thumb in the
Balkans.''
	   Speaking with reporters here Friday, Hill said the Yugoslav
leader assured him he was ``most interested'' in starting peace
talks soon and that he would do nothing to stop the Albanians from
putting together a negotiating team.
	   The intricate web of Albanian factions has made starting talks
with the Serbs difficult. While all sides share a goal for
independence, opposing camps among rebels and politicians have
foiled diplomats struggling to unite Albanians in a group that
could enter negotiations.
	   Hard-line guerrillas reject the pacifist stance of ethnic
Albanian political leader Ibrahim Rugova, while another KLA faction
calls Rugova its leader. Politicians such as Hajrizi, once allied
with Rugova, have in recent months denounced him as ineffective and
formed their own parties.
	   Complicating the mix even further is the apparent difficulty in
identifying who truly represents the Kosovo Liberation Army, a
secretive band whose members numbering anywhere from 20,000 to
50,000 hide in hills and villages scattered around the province.
	   Other KLA members and claimed leaders are in Albania, Germany
and Switzerland, from where they channel money and weapons to the
fighters back home.
	   Hajrizi, the leader of the Albanian Democratic Movement, said he
is currently in contact by telephone with the rebels two or three
times a day. He dismissed speculation that the KLA was cowed by
Milosevic's recent offensive, which drove the rebels from their
headquarters and from two strategic roads.
	   ``They don't consider this a defeat and they've had very flew
losses,'' the politician said. ``We can see in their faces they are
absolutely sure of themselves.''
	   Hajrizi also said the KLA was prepared to sit down for talks
with the Serbs providing that Milosevic withdraws military forces
from the province and that international monitors participate in
negotiations.
	   But Western diplomats said it was unlikely that ethnic Albanians
and Serbs would meet face to face any time soon, and the U.S.-led
shuttle diplomacy between the two sides could continue for weeks if
not months.

Boldon tries for sunny attitude in sunless Stockholm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Ato Boldon says he's running his
smartest season ever. But he may have made a miscalculation in
expecting to find sun in Stockholm.
	   The Swedish capital, where Boldon will compete in the 100-meter
in Thursday's DN Galan meet, is glumly enduring one of the grayest
and wettest summers in recent memory.
	   Boldon drew a round of laughs from journalists on Friday when he
explained why he and his friend-and-rival Maurice Greene had come
to Stockholm nearly a week before the meet.
	   ``We just can't handle that weather in Paris,'' where they had
run in the Gaz de France, Boldon said as rain spattered down.
``That cloud just hangs over, and a lot of the time it can be very
depressing. We feel there is a better chance for sun in
Stockholm.''
	   It could be more than a laughing matter.
	   ``Stockholm always represents the meet at which I start to run
well. It's because I'm usually coming from climates I don't run
well in, cold or rain, and usually here on the day of the meet we
get a nice sunny day,'' said Boldon.
	   But his strategy seems to have worked in past competitions at
Stockholm's 1912 Olympic Stadium. Boldon holds the track record in
the 100 of 9.95.
	   And if foul weather fouls the plans, Boldon's and Greene's coach
John Smith said he's trained his runners to keep things in
perspective.
	   ``When I turn around and look at these brave human beings
running on artificial limbs (I see that) we don't have problems ...
we just have days that don't meet our standards,'' Smith said.
	   ``I mean, we complain about the sun _ it's all relative about
the sun.''

Castro: World financial collapse is coming

visit to Manley's grave, EDITS throughout. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Physically fatigued but ideologically
unfazed, Fidel Castro on Friday predicted a world financial
collapse that would lead to a more just society.
	   ``We have no doubt the present world order is going to go into a
crisis,'' Castro told an audience of several hundred ordinary
Jamaicans. ``And after, there will have to be a new world, a
different world with a new culture, because we know that culture
cannot be the culture of the consumer society.''
	   Castro, on the third and last day of a triumphant visit, said
that the 1994 Mexico currency crisis, last year's Asian crisis, the
economic turmoil in Russia and the prolonged Japanese stagnation
all pointed to a global failure of capitalism.
	   ``They are trying to provide sedatives because their disease is
incurable and cancer cannot be cured with aspirin,'' he told the
group, which came for a dialogue but received a lecture delivered
in Spanish and translated into English by an interpreter.
	   Earlier, Castro, dressed in a dark business suit with a red,
black and yellow striped tie, stood in meditation at the graveside
of former Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley. He laid a flower
wreath dedicated ``to the unforgettable friend.''
	   Manley's flirtation with socialism nearly bankrupted the
Jamaican economy in the 1970s, and when the conservative Edward
Seaga came to power he cut off relations with Cuba.
	   But there appeared to be scant memory of those times during
Castro's three-day stay in Jamaica, the first stop on a
three-nation tour that takes him to Barbados later Friday and on to
Grenada on Sunday.
	   All are countries that once shunned him but now are leading a
campaign to soften the U.S. position on Cuba _ a reflection of a
general bitterness about U.S. economic policy in the region.
	   Jamaican Prime Minister P.J. Patterson welcomed Castro as ``one
of the great leaders of the 20th century'' and promised his support
to reintegrate Cuba into the region. Even Seaga met Castro for the
first time Thursday and declared the animosity over.
	   Outside the cemetery Friday, a few dozen people gathered
carrying homemade signs welcoming Castro. ``Love that man! Love
that man!'' said one of them, Elaine Green. ``The times are
changing _ when is the United States going to change?''
	   Castro has cast himself as a champion of the economically
vulnerable island nations of the Caribbean, charging that U.S.
policies have caused factories to leave the area, cost thousands of
jobs and threaten its limited trade.
	   Castro leaves Jamaica on Friday for Barbados, where he will
honor the 73 victims of the 1976 bombing of a Cuban jetliner.
	   The 71-year-old Castro has looked tired on occasion during his
trip, but he has stuck to a rigorous schedule and on Thursday night
spoke for over two hours _ helping dispel reports that he is
ailing.

Robinson ends four-day visit, pleas for U.S. patience with Haiti
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ At the head of a delegation of
prominent black Americans, U.S. activist Randall Robinson wound up
a good will visit to Haiti Friday with a plea for U.S. patience
towards troubled Haiti.
	   The four-day visit will help the delegation to continue working
for ``constancy in American support for Haiti as well as
patience,'' Robinson said in an interview.
	   The findings of the delegation were heartening, said Robinson,
who directs the TransAfrica Forum in Washington D.C., where he
works to influence U.S. policy toward Africa and the Caribbean.
	   During the 1991-94 army coup d'etat, ``bodies littered the
streets. Now Port-au-Prince is safer than most major American
cities,'' Robinson said. ``The fact that we are here and safe is
testimony to the country's enormous progress.''
	   Robinson said the fact that his wife Hazel Ross Robinson is
currently a paid lobbyist for the Haitian government did not affect
the objectivity of his assessment.
	   From January 1995 to May 1997, the Haitian government paid Hazel
Ross Robinson &AMP; Associates more than dlrs 400,000 in fees and
reimbursement of expenses, U.S. Justice Department documents
revealed.
	   ``The people in Haiti are experiencing confidence in the
future,'' said novelist Walter Mosley, one of the nine members of
the delegation that included businessman Melvin Clark, actor Danny
Glover, union leader Bill Lucy, and television host Tavis Smaly.
	   But fewer and fewer people share their enthusiasm.
	   More than 90 percent of the electorate voted in the 1990
presidential election Aristide swept in a landslide. Disenchanted
with their bickering leaders and discouraged by chronic economic
depression, only 30 percent voted in 1995, and between 5 and 10
percent in 1997.
	   ``Haiti's ruling circle has lost its national and international
credibility. The TransAfrica visit is an attempt to polish its
tarnished image,'' said socialist party co-leader Mischa Gaillard,
in an interview with The Associated Press. Gaillard's party has
boycotted the electoral process since June 1995.
	   Haiti has been without effective government since June 1997,
when Premier Rosny Smarth resigned.
	   Meanwhile, international patience with Haiti is wearing thin.
President Clinton is seeking to double U.S. aid to Haiti, from dlrs
70 million to dlrs 140 million. Both Republicans and Democrats are
objecting.

Israeli air raid after bomb kills Israeli-allied militiaman
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Israeli air raid; no pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli planes fired rockets at
guerrilla routes in southern Lebanon Friday, hours after a roadside
bomb killed a pro-Israeli militiaman, Lebanese security officials
said.
	   At least two Israeli fighter-bombers fired a total of four
missiles at guerrilla infiltration paths in a valley near Jezzine
in the Israeli-occupied zone, the officials said.
	   Less than three hours before the raid, a roadside bomb,
apparently detonated by remote control, went off on a road outside
Jezzine as a pickup truck was passing.
	   The driver, Nabil Iskandar, a member of the South Lebanon Army
militia, was killed instantly and his sister Salam, 12, who was
sitting next to him, was wounded, the officials said.
	   Salam is being treated at a nearby hospital.
	   Jezzine is 20 kilometers (13 miles) north of Marjayoun, the main
town in the Israeli-occupied sector. It is run by the
Israeli-backed SLA, a local militia of 2,500 which maintains the
zone with 1,500 Israeli soldiers. Israel set up the zone in 1985 to
protect its northern territory from guerrilla attacks.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the roadside
bombing. But the attack bore the hallmarks of the Hezbollah
movement, whose guerrillas have frequently used such bombs in their
campaign to oust Israeli soldiers and the SLA from the zone.
	   On Thursday, one Israeli soldier was killed and five others were
wounded in an ambush by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah.

First Swedish win, American eyes podium; one more team quits

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to move up reference to Backstedt, drug scandal
developments

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AUTUN, France (AP) _ After losing another team before the day's
racing began, the Tour de France returned to home territory Friday
with the 19th stage won by Magnus Backstedt of Sweden.
	   It was the first time Sweden had ever won a leg of the Tour de
France. Maarten Den Bakker of the Netherlands was second, Italian
Eddy Mazzolini third and Pascal Derame of France was fourth.
	   But the drug scandal cast an even darker shadow on a Tour de
France that has continued to lose riders out of protest or due to
allegations.
	   The Dutch team TVM pulled out of the race Friday morning,
reducing the field to just 14 teams compared to 21 at the start.
Just 96 cyclists started the race's 19th leg, about half the number
who began the Tour.
	   And more legal action came Friday, with the first cyclist placed
under formal investigation, one step short of being charged.
	   The 19th stage began in Switzerland and ended in Autun, France,
after a leg of 242 kilometers (151.3 miles.)
	   A group of 13 riders broke away early and built up a big lead.
Less than two hours into the stage, the margin was up to more than
11 minutes. At the end, the pack was 16 minutes behind.
	   In the final kilometers, the 22-year-old Backstedt took a few
riders away and won in the final sprint.
	   Marco Pantani of Italy retained the yellow jersey despite
finishing behind the main pack. He was not concerned with the
leaders, all far behind in the overall standings.
	   Pantani still has a 5 minute, 42 second lead over American Bobby
Julich. Defending champion Jan Ullrich is 5:56 behind.
	   There is a final time trial on Saturday in Le Creusot. In the
last time trial of the Tour, Ullrich beat Pantani by 4:21. Ullrich
also beat Julich by 1:18.
	   Safely in second place as the Tour de France arrived in the wine
country of Burgundy, Bobby Julich was thinking ahead to another
appealing locale: the winner's podium on the Champs-Elysees.
	   Hopefully, Julich says, he'll be on the podium's second step _
one above Ullrich.
	   ``Those 14 seconds are very, very important,'' Julich said of
the gap between him and Ullrich. ``I expect a big battle for
second.''
	   But there was no respite from the doping scandal that has
enveloped the Tour, with the exit of TVM, one of two teams at the
very center of the investigation.
	   ``They are neither physically nor mentally capable of finishing
this Tour de France,'' said Tour director Jean-Marie Leblanc,
reading a team statement.
	   Six teams have pulled out in anger at police tactics, and one,
Festina, was expelled on July 17 after its officials admitted to
systematic doping.
	   More legal action in the drug probe came Friday when authorities
placed Italian rider Rodolfo Massi under formal investigation,
along with Dr. Nicolas Terrados Cepada of the Spanish team Once.
	   It was the first time in the probe that authorities had taken
such action against a rider. Altogether, five people have been
placed under formal investigation.
	   Police treatment of the TVM team Tuesday night sparked the
riders' unprecedented protest the following day, leading to the
annulment of the 17th stage.
	   The TVM riders were taken to the hospital and given lengthy
medical examinations, including blood, urine and hair tests.
	   Team masseur Jann Moors, now in custody, will be questioned
Friday by an investigating judge in the city of Lille.
	   The defending champion, Ullrich, had harsh words Friday for some
of his fellow riders _ and also the French justice system.
	   ``What I'm feeling I can't really describe,'' Ullrich wrote in a
column for the German daily newspaper Bild. ``I'm both unbelievably
angry and deeply disappointed. A great race has been stolen from
all of us.''
	   But most riders weren't talking about the scandal on Friday _
they were thinking ahead.
	   ``Nothing is won yet,'' said Pantani. ``I need to stay
concentrated.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Sally Becker, a British aid worker
imprisoned by the Serbs in embattled Kosovo province, was released
and deported Friday, diplomats and the state-run media said.
	   Ms. Becker was arrested July 16 and sentenced to 30 days in
prison for illegally crossing the Albanian-Yugoslav border while
trying to help Kosovo refugees.
	   She was released Friday and deported to neighboring Macedonia,
where she caught a flight for Britain, according to diplomats who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The Serbian state-run TV confirmed Becker was released. The
official Tanjug news agency said she was banned from returning to
Serb-led Yugoslavia.
	   On July 23, Ms. Becker announced that she had stopped eating and
drinking in her prison cell in Lipljane, 20 kilometers (12 miles)
south of Kosovo's capital Pristina, to show support for the
innocent victims of the fighting in the Serbian province.
	   She briefly fell unconscious Monday after five days of hunger
strike, and had an intravenous feeding tube attached by Serbian
doctors.
	   She is known as the Angel of Mostar for her humanitarian efforts
in that Bosnian city during the 3 1/2 war.

Boldon tries for sunny attitude in sunless Stockholm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Ato Boldon says he's running his
smartest season ever. But he may have made a miscalculation in
expecting to find sun in Stockholm.
	   The Swedish capital, where Boldon will compete in the 100-meter
in Thursday's DN Galan meet, is glumly enduring one of the grayest
and wettest summers in recent memory.
	   Boldon drew a round of laughs from journalists on Friday when he
explained why he and his friend-and-rival Maurice Greene had come
to Stockholm nearly a week before the meet.
	   ``We just can't handle that weather in Paris,'' where they had
run in the Gaz de France, Boldon said as rain spattered down.
``That cloud just hangs over, and a lot of the time it can be very
depressing. We feel there is a better chance for sun in
Stockholm.''
	   It could be more than a laughing matter.
	   ``Stockholm always represents the meet at which I start to run
well. It's because I'm usually coming from climates I don't run
well in, cold or rain, and usually here on the day of the meet we
get a nice sunny day,'' said Boldon.
	   But his strategy seems to have worked in past competitions at
Stockholm's 1912 Olympic Stadium. Boldon holds the track record in
the 100 of 9.95.
	   And if foul weather fouls the plans, Boldon's and Greene's coach
John Smith said he's trained his runners to keep things in
perspective.
	   ``When I turn around and look at these brave human beings
running on artificial limbs (I see that) we don't have problems ...
we just have days that don't meet our standards,'' Smith said.
	   ``I mean, we complain about the sun _ it's all relative about
the sun.''

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Islamic hard-liners protested against a
liberal newspaper Friday in the holy city of Qom and in Tehran,
where police had to prevent militants from storming the editor's
offices.
	   About 4,000 people marched through Qom, shouting slogans such as
``Death to mercenary newspapers,'' the official Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
	   Some 300 hard-liners staged a similar protest in Tehran's
Palestine Square, condemning the weekly newspaper Khaneh which had
published a letter critical of Iran's late supreme leader,
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
	   The demonstrators in both Tehran and Qom, 80 miles (130
kilometers) southwest of the capital, demanded that Culture
Minister Ataollah Mohajerani resign. The minister is reponsible for
publications.
	   The demonstrators were allied to hard-line elements in the
ruling hierarchy that oppose the liberal reforms introduced by
President Mohammad Khatami, who took office in August 1997.
	   About 30 baton-wielding policemen blocked a dozen militants from
the building of Khaneh's offices. The militants' leader argued with
police and then left.
	   Hard-liners threw a petrol bomb at the paper's offices Monday
and made threatening phone calls to its editors.
	   Khaneh's managing director, Mohammad-Reza Za'eri, was arrested
this week for printing a letter that allegedly insulted ``Islamic
sanctities'' and Khomeini.
	   Khomeini, who led Iran during the 1980-88 war with Iraq, is
portrayed almost as a saint by the clergy. Any criticism of him is
taboo.
	   But Khaneh published a letter that has become the talk of the
town. The newspaper did not identify the writer, describing her as
a young woman.
	   ``When I think of Khomeini, all that comes to mind are the
horrifying sounds of the midnight bombs that used to fall on Tehran
and the blood of thousands of innocent young Iranians who died in
that war'' with Iraq, the woman wrote in the letter to Khaneh.
	   She added: ``Do you call me to follow someone who has
transformed Iran into an international terrorist state with his
order to murder Salman Rushdie?''
	   Khomeini said it was the religious duty of Muslims worldwide to
kill Rushdie for insulting Islam in his novel ``The Satanic
Verses.'' Iran put a bounty on Rushdie's head.
	   The publication of the letter and the remarks against Khomeini
are the result of a free press policy being pushed by President
Khatami.
	   ``Some people, as soon as they smell a bit of freedom, think
they can do whatever they want,'' the hard-line chief judge
Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi said Friday.
	   ``If anyone tries to insult Islam and the imam (Khomeini), the
nation will not tolerate it,'' Yazdi told worshipers at a Tehran
University prayer sermon.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congo's finance minister and a leading
opposition politician have been arrested in Kinshasa over the past
two days, relatives and authorities said Friday.
	   Eugene Diomi Ndongala, a cabinet minister in the government of
former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, was arrested Friday by
Intelligence Service agents, his wife said.
	   No reason was given, she said, asking that her name not be used.
This is the second time since the fall of the Mobutu regime last
year that Ndongala has been arrested.
	   On Thursday, Finance Minister Ferdinand Tala-Ngai was arrested
at his home.
	   He was released a day later after being interrogated about
rumors of his alleged involvement in a plot by ethnic Tutsis from
from neighboring Rwanda to oust Congo's President Laurent Kabila, a
friend of Tala-Ngai said on condition of anonymity.
	   Tala-Ngai's family said that he had been charged with treason.
	   The finance minister is a close friend of another member of
Kabila's inner circle, Gratias Bugera, an ethnic Tutsi who has been
reported missing since last week.
	   Congo's government has fallen out with Rwanda's Tutsi
government, which helped Kabila's forces rise to power in a
rebellion last year. Rwandan soldiers working with Congo's army
have been ordered home, according to Kinshasa officials. Rwanda has
refuted that version, saying it withdrew its troops.
	   The Kinshasa daily newspaper Vision in March reported that
Tala-Ngai was going to be arrested for allegedly stealing
government funds. The newspaper's publisher spent a month in prison
for printing the story.
	   The finance minister visited the eastern Congolese towns of
Kisangani, Goma and Bukavu earlier this month to promote government
aid programs and fiscal reform. Shortly after his return to the
capital, Kinshasa, on Tuesday, Tala-Ngai was called to the office
of the president's security advisor.
	   The latest arrests come about six weeks after President Laurent
Kabila launched a purge of his cabinet. Kabila had at least five
top ministers arrested in June, including the director of Congo's
state broadcasting authority.
	   The broadcasting director was arrested for failing to televise a
ceremony to swear in new ministers brought in to replace the
arrested ones.

Rescuers find two more bodies, airline criticizes pilot
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with two more bodies found, ADDS byline
 &UR; By PHILIPPE DOSSAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VANNES, France (AP) _ Divers off the Brittany coast on Friday
retrieved two more bodies from the wreckage of a commuter plane
that collided with another small aircraft, killing 15 people,
officials said.
	   Meanwhile, the pilot of the commuter plane came under fire from
his airline for leaving his flight path, allegedly to get a better
view of a cruise ship for his passengers, shortly before the
Thursday crash.
	   The French navy divers found the bodies after locating two
sections of the Proteus Airlines Beechcraft off Quiberon, a port
500 kilometers (310 miles) southwest of Paris, officials said. Six
bodies were recovered Thursday.
	   Six other bodies remained missing from the accident, the
officials said on customary anonymity.
	   The Beechcraft, with 12 passengers and two crew aboard, collided
with a Cessna belonging to a local flying club, with only the pilot
aboard. The Proteus plane was on a regularly scheduled commercial
flight from Lyon to Lorient, another coastal city in Brittany.
	   Judicial sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
divers located the black boxes in the twin-engine plane, but
authorities running the salvage operation did not immediately
confirm it.
	   Capt. Joel Royer said the divers would have to wait until
Saturday to bring the debris to the surface with the help of
equipment.
	   The president of Proteus Airlines said the pilot of the
Beechcraft apparently did not respect the company's flight
procedures when he made a detour to fly over the ship Norway to
give the passengers a better look.
	   ``It is clear that barring procedure and immediate danger,
flying by sight is prohibited by Proteus,'' said Franklin Devaux,
the company president. ``It's clear there was a change of course,
that he apparently flew over the Norway.''
	   Minutes before the crash, the Proteus pilot contact the control
tower at Lorient-Lann Bihoue Airport to request authorization for
the overflight. It was not clear if the pilot got the go-ahead.
	   Investigators have launched an investigation of the collision.
	   Created in 1986, Proteus provides service to 12 cities in
France. The company has about 20 planes and is partially owned by
the U.S. airliner Delta.
	   It was the worst air accident in France since 1992 when an
Airbus 320 crashed near Strasbourg killing 87 people.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Sally Becker, a British aid worker
imprisoned by the Serbs in embattled Kosovo province, was released
and deported Friday, diplomats and the state-run media said.
	   Ms. Becker was arrested July 16 and sentenced to 30 days in
prison for illegally crossing the Albanian-Yugoslav border while

late Friday.
	   The official Tanjug news agency said she was banned from

Parnevik 8-under-par when play suspended because of darkness
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Jesper Parnevik topped the leaderboard
at 8-under-par through 14 holes when Friday's second round was
suspended because of darkness in the dlrs 1.3-million Scandinavian
Masters.
	   Parnevik, winner of the 1995 tournament on another Swedish
course, bogeyed the first hole but made five birdies between the
second and eleventh holes.
	   Torrential rain forced a suspension of four and a half hours in
the morning. A total of 58 players were unable to complete the
second round. Weather permitting, they will complete the second
round early Saturday before the third round.
	   The bad weather didn't bother Parnevik, who shot a 67 Thursday
and tied for third.
	   ``I stayed at home and relaxed,'' he said.
	   Parnevik grew up only a short drive from the European Tour Club
north of the Swedish capital and the tight, tree-lined course suits
his game very well. Few players master all shots like the Swede, a
U.S. Tour regular who won his first American title in the Phoenix
Open early this year.
	   Michael Jonzon, another Swede, was 6 under through 15 holes when
play was suspended in the evening. Jonzon had three birdies and one
eagle.
	   Brian Davis of England, who shared the overnight lead with
Swedish amateur sensation Anders Hultman, shared the clubhouse lead
with Sweden's Mathias Gronberg at 137, 5 under par. Davis shot 72,
Gronberg 69.
	   Hultman, who's heading to Oklahoma State University in two
weeks, had three double-bogeys and finished with a 76. That was 11
strokes off his score Thursday, when he and Davis tied the course
record (65).
	   Jose Maria Olazabal, who won The Masters in 1994 at Augusta
National, was heading home after his worst tournament in seven
years. He had a 36-hole total of 153, 11 over par, after rounds of
79 and 74.
	   ``My driving is terrible,'' the Spaniard said. ``I hit the ball
into the trees many times, into the water three or four times and
into the rough.''
	   Colin Montgomerie also struggled to a 74 after two straight
double-bogeys but the burly Scot is likely to make the cut with a
144 aggregate.
	   Derrick Cooper of England had perhaps the strangest incident of
the day. Starting on the 11th hole, he lost a ball early and then
hit five straight balls into the water on the 16th, a par 3-hole
where Norwegian Per Haugsrud missed a hole-in-one and a new Volvo
car by just 10 centimeters during the first round.
	   Cooper then discovered he didn't have another ball in his bag
and was forced to retire on the 11th tee.
	   ``I had plenty of balls in my locker in the clubhouse, but not
in my bag'' he said. ``But I never expected to lose six balls in
one round.''

Chilean President shuffles cabinet, leading figure quits
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds. UPDATES throughout with more resignations and speculation on
replacements &QL; 
 &UR; SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Five ministers resigned from the Chilean
government Friday after President Eduardo Frei said he was planning
a cabinet shuffle for the final stage of his term.

<TEXT>
	   A new 21-member cabinet will be announced on Saturday, the
government said.
	   Public Works Minister Ricardo Lagos, widely expected to seek the
pro-government coalition's presidential nomination in next year's
election, quit along with the Ministers of Interior Carlos
Figueroa, Economy Alvaro Garcia, chief-of-staff Juan Villarzu and
chief spokesman Jose Brunner.
	   Lagos, Garcia and Brunner are members of the Socialist Party
while Figueroa and Villarzu are members of Frei's Christian
Democratic Party.
	   ``The president told me he is planning a cabinet change for the
final stage of his term,'' which ends in March 2000, Lagos said.
``So I considered it convenient to resign and leave him freedom of
action.''
	   Lagos' departure from the post he has held since 1994 was
considered the most politically important because of his probable
presidential nomination. His main rival is Sen. Andres Zaldivar, a
member of Frei's Christian Democratic Party.
	   Local media reports said Frei was recalling his envoy to
Washington, George Biehl, to fill the sensitive Defense Ministry
post. Current Defense Minister Raul Troncoso, one of Frei's closest
aides, would become Interior Minister, in charge of internal
security.
	   The shuffle was not expected to bring any changes in the
government's economic policies.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ It still doesn't feel like a world
championship, and few of the 250 fans who saw the United States
beat South Korea 88-62 Friday could disagree.
	   Nor would the several hundred at tournament-favorite
Yugoslavia's 99-54 victory over Japan.
	   As the three-day preliminary round ended Friday, only
homestanding Greece has drawn near-sellout crowds in the 18,000 and
14,000-seat areans here and everyone knows why: there's No
You-Know-What Team.
	   ``I think that will change as this thing goes on,'' said U.S.
coach Rudy Tomjanovich. ``I scouted the worlds in Toronto in '94
and some of the games were like this.''
	   ``That's something you have to deal with. You've got to make
your own excitement to keep yourself up.''
	   After a two-point loss Thursday against Lithuania, any victory
was welcome for the makeshift Americans (2-1), who were led by
Jason Sasser with 17 scored against the tournament's smallest team.
	   `It's the first time I played against a team that was that small
since I was in high school,'' said 6-9 (2.06-meter) David Wood.
	   Moon Kyung Eun, a 6-2 guard (1.90 meter) led the Koreans (0-3)
with 14.
	   With second-round play beginning Sunday, Lithuania, Yugoslavia,
Greece and Spain got through the first round undefeated and must be
the favorites in a wide-open field.
	   The top three from each group advance to the round-robin second
round, forming two new six-team brackets. Four countries from each
will move on to the quarterfinals.
	   In key games Sunday it's: Yugoslavia vs. Canada, Russia vs.
Italy, Puerto Rico vs. Greece, Australia vs. Lithuania, United
States vs. Argentina, Spain vs. Brazil.
	   Lithuania (3-0) trailed by as many as 14 in the first half
against Brazil (1-2) but survived 66-62. Former Seton Hall star
Arturas Karnisovas had 20 and Saulius Sombergas added 18 as the
Lithuanians were feeling a letdown after the emotional win over the
United States.
	   ``We won today so I can't say we're tired mentally. But playing
like we did yesterday and then staying up until 3 a.m. to watch the
game on television tired us physically,'' Lithuanian coach Jonas
Kazlauskas said. ``We spent a lot of emotion.''
	   Yugoslavia (3-0) routed winless Japan 99-54 as Sasha Obradovic
and Dragan Lukovsi had 18 points. The 1990 world champions hit
14-of-22 shots from behind the 3-point line.
	   ``My goal was to build an early lead after playing two rough
games with Russia and Puerto Rico,'' said Yugoslav coach Zeljko
Obradovic.
	   Russia (2-1) defeated Puerto Rico 86-73 as Vassily Karassev
scored 17. Puerto Rico (1-2) led 54-45 with 15:21 left in the game,
but scored just one field goal over the final seven minutes as
Russia hit a 15-2 run to take the lead for good.
	   Veteran center Jose Ortiz led Puerto Rico with 18 points and 15
rebounds before fouling out.
	   Italy (2-1) defeated Canada (1-2) 79-69. Italy's top player,
Carlton Myers, played for the first time at the tournament. The
guard, who was sidelined by a fever and sore throat, scored 11
points in 24 minutes of action.
	   Australia (1-2) _ Goodwill Games silver medalists _ limped into
the next round by holding off Nigeria 70-64 behind 24 points from
Shane Heal and 20 from Andrew Gaze.
	   Dallas Mavericks center Chris Anstey, the only NBA player at the
worlds, contributed 13 points and 9 rebounds.
	   Nigeria (0-3) played without center Julius Nwosu, who was
suspended from the tournament earlier Friday by FIBA because he
tested positive for the banned substance ephedrine. Nwosu, who had
a brief pro career in the NBA and CBA, was tested after Nigeria's
loss to Spain on Wednesday, the event's opening day.
	   Coach Ayo Bakare said Nwosu bought the vitamin supplement and
couldn't read the contents because they were written in Greek.
	   Spain (3-0) won in overtime over Argentina 68-67 as Alfonso
Reyes scored an inside basket at the gun off a pass from Ignacio
Rodriguez. Alberto Herreros led Spain with 21 and Rodriguez has 18.
Argentina (2-1), which trailed 31-22 at half, was led by Hugo
Sconochini's 17.
	   Greece (3-0) defeated Senegal (0-3) as Dimitris Papanikolaou,
Georgios Sigalas and Angelos Koronios had 11 each. Senegal led
30-29 at halftime, but broke the game open with a 17-5 run to start
the second half.

Former husband of purported Cuban doctor denies claims about
</HEADLINE>
Castro's health &QL; 
 &UR; By JAVIER BAENA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ The former husband of a purported Cuban
doctor who claimed Fidel Castro suffered a brain disease said
Friday that she lied about being a physician and that her claims
about the Cuban leader's health were fabricated.
	   Felix Ochoa Cabrera, who is himself a surgeon, told reporters
his ex-wife was not a doctor but rather a secretary who lied to El
Nuevo Herald _ the Spanish-language newspaper published by The
Miami Herald - when she said Castro suffered from the potentially
fatal disease.
	   Earlier this week the newspaper itself acknowledged there were
questions about Elizabeth Trujillo Izquierdo's claims, which also
have been denied by the Cuban government and several of Trujillo's
acquaintances.
	   In an interview from Costa Rica last week, Trujillo, 34, told
the Herald that she was present at a Havana hospital Oct. 22 when
Castro was rushed there with symptoms of hypertensive
encephalopathy, a rise in blood pressure that often leads to
stroke. The condition paralyzes brain functions and can lead to
death in severe cases.
	   ``She never worked in that clinic. She studied for several
months in a nursing school, and she did not graduate. When I met
her she was a secretary at a paper company in Havana,'' Ochoa said,
adding that he and Trujillo were divorced last year. Ochoa, 50, now
lives in Bogota.
	   Trujillo has claimed she is seeking political asylum in Costa
Rica after fleeing Cuba.
	   In its initial report on July 19, the newspaper said it had
confirmed Trujillo's identity through documents and multiple
sources. But it said no other sources in or outside Cuba confirmed
her report of Castro's illness.
	   Trujillo's comments had revived speculation about the
71-year-old leader's reportedly delicate health.
	   ``As things now appear it seems that Mrs. Trujillo has lied to
El Nuevo Herald, to La Nacion of San Jose, the main newspaper of
Costa Rica and to the Costa Rican government,'' Roberto Fabricio,
managing editor of El Nuevo Herald, said in Wednesday's editions.
	   Ochoa said his ex-wife was ``not trustworthy.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Sally Becker, a British aid worker
imprisoned by the Serbs in embattled Kosovo province, was released
and deported Friday, diplomats and the state-run media said.
	   Ms. Becker was arrested July 16 and sentenced to 30 days in
prison for illegally crossing the Albanian-Yugoslav border while
trying to help Kosovo refugees.
	   She was released Friday and deported to neighboring Macedonia,
where she caught a flight for Britain, according to diplomats who
spoke on condition of anonymity. Britain's domestic news agency,
Press Association, said she arrived at Stansted airport near London
late Friday.

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ The Colorado Rockies traded outfielder Ellis
Burks to the San Francisco Giants on Friday for outfielder Darryl
Hamilton, minor league pitcher James Stoops and a player to be
named.
	   The trade was announced in the top of the seventh inning of the
Rockies' game with the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field.
	   Burks, batting .288 entering the game with 16 homers and 54
RBIs, started in center field and went 0-for-3. He was replaced in
the bottom of the seventh by Curtis Goodwin.
	   Burks, 33, has been with the Rockies since 1994 when he signed
as a free agent. His best season came in 1996 when he batted .344
with 40 homers, 128 RBIs and 32 stolen bases. He is in the final
season of a two-year deal.
	   The Giants began the day 3 1/2 games behind the Cubs in the NL
wild-card race.
	   Hamilton, 33, was batting .294 with one homer and 26 RBIs.

Rangers get Zeile in trade from Marlins
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Todd Zeile was traded for the second time this
season, with the Texas Rangers acquiring the third baseman from the
Florida Marlins on Friday for a pair of minor leaguers.
	   Zeile, 32, is hitting .276 with 13 homers and 66 RBIs. He was
acquired by Florida from Los Angeles in May as part of the Mike
Piazza trade.
	   Florida's payroll, which was dlrs 53 million at the end of 1997
at dlrs 33 million at the start of the season, dropped to about
dlrs 13 million. Zeile is making dlrs 3.2 million this year and is
guaranteed dlrs 3.2 million in 1999.
	   Florida got third base prospect Jose Santo, hitting .299 with 21
homers and 90 RBIs in 107 games at Class-A Savannah, and
right-handed pitcher Daniel DeYoung. 13-4 with a 4.02 ERA in 20
starts at Class-A Charlotte.
	   The right-handed-hitting Zeile has a career average of .265 with
153 homers and 679 RBIs in 1,165 games with St. Louis, the Chicago
Cubs, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Los Angeles and Florida. He had
career highs of 31 home runs and 90 RBIs with the Dodgers last
year.
	   Texas will be Zeile's seventh club.

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Alfonso Reyes scored at the gun in
overtime to lift Spain to a 68-67 victory Friday over Argentina in
one of the hardest fought games of the World Basketball
Championship.
	   Reyes scored an inside basket at the gun off a pass from Ignacio
Rodriguez to seal the Spanish victory.
	   Alberto Herreros led Spain (3-0) with 21 and Rodriguez had 18.
Argentina (2-1) was led by Hugo Sconochini's 17.
	   Spain, which led at halftime 31-22, was made to play five more
minutes as Argentina kept fighting back and forced overtime when
Juan Alberto Espil hit a 3-point shot with 1:14 to play in
regulation to make it 61-61.
	   It was the first time in the second half that Argentina wasn't
trailing.
	   Argentina took a four-point lead in overtime _ 65-61 _ on
baskets by Fabricio Oberto and Alejandro Montecchia but failed to
hold on and Spain rallied.
	   Argentina will face the United States (2-1) Sunday as the second
round opens and Spain goes against Brazil (1-2).

<TEXT>
	   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) _ In a big deal made on the day of the
trading deadline, the St. Louis Cardinals sent pitcher Todd
Stottlemyre and shortstop Royce Clayton to the Texas Rangers on
Friday for pitcher Darren Oliver and third basemen Fernando Tatis.
	   Stottlemyre, who had been mentioned in several trade rumors this
season, was 9-9 this season with a 3.51 ERA. The 33-year-old
right-hander was acquired from Oakland before the 1996 season.
	   Clayton, 28, was acquired by St. Louis before the 1996 season
and became Ozzie Smith's successor at shortstop. While he hit a
combined .271 in his first two seasons with St. Louis, Clayton
dropped to .234 this year with four homers and 29 RBIs.
	   Oliver, 27, is 6-7 with a team-high 6.53 ERA in 19 starts.
Tatis, 23, is hitting .270 with three homers and 32 RBIs.

Tropical storm strengethens off Mexico's Pacific coast

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with tropical storm Alex weakening &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A tropical storm that formed off of Mexico's
Pacific coast is expected to become a hurricane but was heading
west and away from land, the U.S. National Hurricane Center
reported.
	   Tropical storm Estelle was over 300 miles (483 kilometers) south
of Manzanillo, Mexico at 11:00 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT), with sustained
winds of nearly 70 mph (113 kph). It was heading west at about 9
mph (14 kph).
	   Hurricanes have minimum sustained wind speeds of 74 mph (119
kph).
	   Forecasters said it Estelle would probably grow to hurricane
force by Friday, but early predictions of the track indicated it
was unlikely to hit land.
	   In Miami, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center said
Friday that tropical storm Alex is weakening, and its winds may
slow enough for it to be downgraded to a tropical depression,
	   ``The good news is that the storm is falling apart,'' center
director Jerry Jarrell said.
	   But there is some bad news.
	   ``There is a very impressive looking wave behind Alex that may
become something,'' Jarrell said. ``That will be at least next week
before we get a look at it.''
	   Alex is centered farther south than previously thought, so it
could move closer to Puerto Rico and other Caribbean islands. But
forecasters say the threat is minimal.
	   At 2100 GMT Friday, Alex was located near 15.8 north latitude,
51.1 west longitude, or about 600 miles (965 kilometers) east of
the Leeward Islands in the eastern Caribbean.
	   The storm's wind speed decreased to near 40 mph (65 kph). It is
moving west at about 12 mph (19 kph). Forecasters say that although
they said Thursday that they expected Alex to reach hurricane
status within two days, strong southerly upper-level winds hit the
storm, weakening it.
	   Forecasters said Alex could be downgraded to a tropical
depression Friday night or Saturday.

Blue Jays trade Guzman to Orioles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Pitcher Juan Guzman, who had been expecting a
deal, was traded from the Toronto Blue Jays to the Baltimore
Orioles on Friday for pitcher Nerio Rodriguez and minor league
outfielder Shannon Carter.
	   Toronto made its second deal in two days. Baltimore began the
day eight games behind Boston in the American League wild-card
race.
	   Told before Thursday night's game that several teams were
interested in him, Guzman went out and pitched eight strong innings
in a 1-0 win over Texas.
	   Guzman said he was surprised to be going to Baltimore, saying he
had thought he was headed for Los Angeles.
	   Guzman is 6-12 with a 4.41 ERA in 22 starts this season. He has
come on strong in recent weeks after recovering from shoulder
surgery in September, going 3-4 with a 2.01 ERA in his last eight
starts.
	   The 31-year-old right-hander is eligible for free agency at the
end of the season.
	   Guzman, who led the American League in ERA in 1996, has a career
record is 75-62 with a 4.07 ERA.
	   Rodriguez is 1-3 this season with an 8.05 ERA with Baltimore.

Camilla joins young princes at Prince Charles' birthday bash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Princes Charles' early 50th birthday party wasn't
the surprise that his sons had hoped, but there was one prominent
unadvertised guest at Friday's celebrations.
	   Camilla Parker Bowles, who reportedly met Prince William and
Prince Harry for the first time only this summer, was there to
cheer her long-time love, according to Press Association, the
British news agency. She was among a hundred guests at the
festivities at Highgrove, Charles' home in Gloucestershire in
western England.
	   The party, arranged by Prince William, 16, and Prince Harry, 13,
was well in advance of their father's actual birth date, which is
Nov. 14.
	   Contrary to some earlier reports, Queen Elizabeth II did not
attend, but spent the weekend at her Sandringham estate. Charles'
brothers, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, were there and so was
his sister, Princess Anne.
	   William and Harry had been planning a surprise party, but their
plans were revealed by the Sunday Mirror newspaper.
	   ``We are not confirming any details of this private party given
by Prince William and Prince Harry for their father,'' said
Charles' spokeswoman, Sandy Henney.
	   ``There are no media facilities and members of the media are not
welcome at the venue.''
	   So journalists had to stand outside to see who went to the
party. From their vantage point at the gates, they were able to
report that Rowan Atkinson, start of ``Mr. Bean,'' arrived in a BMW
and Oscar-winning actress Emma Thompson came in a Toyota, while
journalist Simon Sebag-Montefiore rolled past in a Peugeot with
socialite Tara Palmer-Tomkinson.

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A tropical storm that formed off of Mexico's
Pacific coast has become a hurricane, but was heading west and away
from land, the U.S. National Hurricane Center reported.
	   Hurricane Estelle was 510 miles (820 kilometers) south of the
tip of the Baja California Peninsula at 5:00 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT),
with sustained winds of nearly 85 mph (137 kph). It was heading
west at about 14 mph (23 kph).
	   Hurricanes have minimum sustained wind speeds of 74 mph (119
kph).
	   The storm, which had yet to develop a defined eye at its center,
was expected to move to the west or west-northwest through the
weekend, the center said.
	   Port authorities in Acapulco advised ships to take extreme
caution along the Pacific coast of Guerrero, Michoacan, Jalisco and
Nayarit states. The Michoacan port of Lazaro Cardenas was
restricting activity by small vessels due to intense rain and
waves.

Queen Elizabeth visits McDonald's, but doesn't bite
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ELLESMERE PORT, England (AP) _ Queen Elizabeth II stopped at a
McDonald's restaurant Friday _ just for a chat and a photo op, not
for a Big Mac.
	   Both the monarch and the restaurant ought to be delighted. The
Times' front page on Saturday had a big picture of Her Majesty
walking toward the golden arches.
	   ``The people longed for a less remote monarch: yesterday they
met her,'' the headline said.
	   In the small print the review was more cynical: ``As an exercise
in carefully stage-managed window-shopping, it opened the yes of
both sovereign and subjects,'' The TImes said.
	   After visiting McDonald's, the queen then walked around the
Cheshire Oaks Designer Outlet Village, having a look at kitchenware
and shoes.
	   Apparently responding to surveys which found that the public
regard the monarch as too remote, the queen has lately made a point
of showing a common touch, including a visit to a pensioner in the
east end of London, and a trip to a supermarket.
	   ``I couldn't have imagined the queen driving through a burger
bar a few years ago,'' said Jean Reynolds, 54, of Liverpool, who is
the crowd welcoming th queen.
	   ``The royal family is certainly moving with the times these
days,'' Mrs. Reynolds said.

Mets trade Gilkey to Arizona for Blair
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHOENIX (AP) _ Shaking up the roster for their wild card run,
the New York Mets traded slumping outfielder Bernard Gilkey to the
expansion Arizona Diamondbacks on Friday for right-hander Willie
Blair.
	   As part of the deal, New York also sent minor league
right-hander Nelson Figueroa and cash to the Diamondbacks. They
also will receive catcher Jorge Fabregas a player to be named.
	   Gilkey, 31, was hitting .227 in 82 games with the Mets this
season. He sustained a stress fracture in his left elbow early this
year and was on the disabled list from April 26 to May 11.
	   ``Bernard Gilkey was struggling last year and had a great month
of September. He never got it going again after his elbow injury,''
Phillips said.
	   Blair, 32, signed an dlrs 11.5 million, three-year contract with
Arizona last winter after going 16-8 with a 4.17 ERA for Detroit in
1997. But he slumped to 4-15 with a 5.34 ERA in 23 starts for
Arizona.
	   The move may lead to an even bigger trade. The Mets were said to
be discussing a deal that would send pitcher Bobby Jones to the
Chicago White Sox for third baseman Robin Ventura.
	   Fabregas, 28, was batting .199 in 50 games with Arizona. After
Fabregas lost his salary arbitration case last winter, Diamondbacks
owner Jerry Colangelo caused a stir in baseball when he gave the
catcher an extra dlrs 175,000 this year as part of a two-year deal
worth dlrs 2.9 million.
	   Figueroa, 24, was 12-3 with a 4.66 ERA in 21 starts for Double-A
Binghamton of the Eastern League.

Hurst, Burton lead scoring assault at du Maurier

<TEXT>
	   WINDSOR, Ontario (AP) _ Pat Hurst made six straight birdies
Friday in the du Maurier Classic and quietly served noticed that Se
Ri Pak isn't the only woman capable of winning two major
championships this year.
	   Hurst, who won her first major in the Dinah Shore in March, shot
a 7-under-par 65 and shared the lead with Brandie Burton after two
rounds of the lowest scoring in LPGA major championship history.
	   Burton, whose birdie-eagle finish gave her a 64, and Hurst were
at 132. They were one stroke ahead of Betsy King going into the
weekend, with Annika Sorenstam and Meg Mallon another stroke back
at 134.
	   While big galleries and big expectations followed Pak in her bid
to win a third straight major, Hurst made one putt after another
with only about 100 people looking on.
	   That didn't seem to bother the 28-year-old Hurst, whose victory
in the Dinah Shore has been all but forgetten in the euphoria over
Pak.
	   ``You can't take that away from me, and you can't take away from
what Se Ri has done,'' Hurst said. ``What she's done the last five
weeks has been unbelievable.
	   ``I'm just quietly going along, and that's the way I like it.''
	   Pak, trying to become the first woman since Pat Bradley in 1986
to win three majors in a season and the first golfer since Ben
Hogan in 1953 to win three in a row, played another lackluster
round _ a 2-under 70 that left her seven strokes off the lead.
	   ``My game not good, but not bad,'' Pak said. ``Maybe tomorrow or
Sunday I can find solid shot. I have two days left. I have
chance.''
	   Her 5-under 139 through two rounds wasn't nearly enough to keep
pace with the leaders, who had few problems at the Essex Golf and
Country Club on a sunny, sometimes breezy day.
	   ``I think there are a lot of people who can still win the golf
tournament,'' said King, who lacks only the du Maurier for the
LPGA's career grand slam. ``It might take 20-under the way things
look now.''
	   Tammie Green was among those at 9-under 135. Laura Davies worked
herself back into contention with a 67 that left her at 136, along
with Dottie Petter and Helen Alfredsson.
	   ``I don't think you can sharpen this course's teeth too much,''
Davies said. ``Ten-under at a major is usually leading by 10
strokes.''
	   The cut was 2-under 142, the lowest ever for an LPGA major. The
previous record was 1-over 145 in the 1987 LPGA Championship. The
lowest cut for any LPGA Tour event was 3-under 141 in the State
Farm Rail Classic last year at Springfield, Ill.
	   Among those who missed the cut were Bradley, Kelly Robbins and
defending champion Colleen Walker.
	   ``The course is playing a little shorter than a major like the
U.S. Open,'' Hurst said. ``The greens are true, but when you have a
lot of wedges and 9-irons into greens, you will have birdie
opportunities.''
	   No one took more advantage than Hurst.
	   It started with a 6-iron into eight feet for birdie at the par-3
fifth hole. She holed putts on the next two holes, dropped in a
40-footer (12 meters) on No. 8 and then two-putted from 35 feet (10
1/2-meter) at the par-5 ninth.
	   She closed out the best string of birdies in her career with a
15-footer (4 1/2 meters) on No. 10.
	   ``It seemed like the hole was a big garbage can collecting
everything, which was fine by me,'' she said.
	   Burton made three straight birdies to get to 9-under, but then
settled into a routine of nine straight pars _ great for a U.S.
Open, but a sure way to lose ground in the du Maurier.
	   She finished in style, making a birdie putt on No. 8, her 17th
hole of the day. She hit a 4-wood into 30 feet (9 meters) and made
that for eagle at the 450-yard (410-meter) ninth, the easiest hole
on the course.
	   ``I kind of came through a lull in the middle of my round for a
good finish,'' Burton said.
	   Thirty-four players were within six strokes of the lead going
into a weekend that could turn into a shootout, depending on
whether the wind kicks up off the Detroit River, or whether the
leaders falter.

	   ROME _ Omar Linares hit a grand slam and Jose Ibar tossed a
three-hitter to lead Cuba to a 12-1 quarterfinal victory over the
Netherlands at the World Baseball Championship on Friday.
	   Cuba, which is aiming to clinch its sixth consecutive title,
advanced to Saturday's semifinals along with South Korea, Nicaragua
and Italy.
	   Cuba has claimed the gold medal at every world championship it
has played in since 1952, a total of 21 titles from 24 tournaments
overall.
	   ``The team is playing so well,'' Cuban manager Alfonso Urquiola
said. ``I am confident we can win the championship again.''
	   Ibar, the first man to record 20 wins in a Cuban league season,
pitched for the entire game _ halted after the seventh inning
because of the 10-run mercy rule _ and struck out seven.
	   Known as ``El Nino,'' the 30-year-old veteran infielder,
Linares, helped Cuba collect a total of 13 hits compared to the
Netherlands' three.
	   Oscar Machado cracked another homer in the fourth inning to seal
the victory, Cuba's 39th consecutive win at the Worlds since 1986.
	   After trailing Japan for the entire game, South Korea's batters
burst into life, scoring four home runs in the ninth and 10th
innings to help the team clinch an 8-5 victory. The South Koreans
finished runner-up to Cuba at the 1994 Worlds.
	   Nicaragua, winner of five silver medals and three bronzes at the
Worlds, took advantage of Ambriori Ramos' poor pitching to crush
the Dominican Republic 12-4.
	   Italy stunned Australia, which qualified for the quarterfinals
as No. 1 in its pool, winning 9-8 in the 10th inning. In Italy,
baseball trails most other sports in popularity and its team has
never finished better than sixth at the Worlds.
	   The top four teams of each of the two eight-country pools
advanced to the quarterfinals. The final is set for Sunday.
	   The tournament is open to professionals for the first time but
no players from the Major Leagues are participating. Some minor
leaguers are playing for the Dominican Republic and Canada, which
failed to qualify for the quarters along with the United States.

Study: Hospitals were unprepared for Chicago heat wave
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KEVIN HOFFMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Hospital staff may have been able to save
more lives in the 1995 Chicago heat wave if heat stroke victims
were immersed in ice water right away, a study says.
	   Only one of 58 patients admitted for heat stroke during that
time was cooled within 30 minutes, the recommended time frame for a
patient's best chance at survival, according to a study being
released Saturday in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Twelve died
in hospitals. At least nine more died the following year.
	   The study's authors believe many of the victims were sent first
for CAT scans, which delayed the cooling process.
	   ``The medical community in general, including paramedics, should
refreshen their education on heat stroke,'' said Dr. Maurice
Ndukwu, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of
Chicago Medical Center and senior author of the study.
	   The study was conducted in July 1995 when a Chicago heat wave
claimed more than 600 lives. It followed every patient with classic
heat stroke admitted to 12 area hospitals, and found that most
patients suffered from brain, kidney, and cardiovascular damage.
	   Many of the hospitals studied were not adequately prepared to
deal with heat stroke, the study said. This isn't surprising,
Ndukwu said, because it was the first heat wave of such magnitude
to hit Chicago in almost 80 years. Chicago hospitals have since
updated their procedures, he said.
	   Classic heat stroke usually strikes the ill or elderly during
prolonged exposure to heat, a worry again this summer because of a
nationwide heat wave blamed for at least 144 deaths.
	   ``Anybody whose temperature is above 105 degrees Fahrenheit (40
Celsius) should be cooled to 102 (38 Celsius) within 10 to 40
minutes of rescue,'' Ndukwu said.
	   Dr. Robert Spence at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center
said cooling the body is a necessity, but immersion may not be the
best method. Instead, UPMC sprays overheated patients with a fine
mist of water and uses fans to cool them off, he said.
	   ``The evaporation is the quickest way to cool them down,''
Spence said.

Paralyzed gymnast begins rehabilitation

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A Chinese gymnast paralyzed in a Goodwill Games
accident has been told by doctors she likely never will walk again
much less compete.
	   Sang Lan began rehabilitation Friday at Mount Sinai Hospital in
Manhattan, where doctors and therapists will try to return the
17-year-old to as normal a life as possible, Dr. Kristjan T.
Ragnarsson said.
	   ``From the medical point of view, the chances of her gaining
strength in her legs is poor. That doesn't mean there isn't hope,''
Ragnarsson said. ``I am hoping that she will one day be able to
become self-sufficient.
	   From conversations conducted through a translator, ``I think she
fully realizes the extent of her injury,'' Ragnarsson said.
	   The teen-ager broke her neck during a warm-up vault at the
Nassau Coliseum on July 21. She underwent surgery last Saturday,
but has little sensation from the chest down. Doctors have
discounted some toe movement as an involuntary twitch.
	   ``We hope that she will eventually be able to turn herself over
in bed, use a wheelchair and ... take a shower,'' Ragnarsson said.
	   Sang is expected to stay at the hospital for at least two
months, where she will undergo rigorous physical therapy and
receive psychological counseling to help her cope with her
disabilities and ``separation anxiety'' she may experience when her
teammates depart at the end of the games Sunday, the doctor added.
	   China's 1997 national vault champion also will continue to take
an experimental nerve-building medicine. But doctors have warned
against calling it a miracle drug.
	   Ragnarsson is the same doctor who treated New York Jets
defensive lineman Dennis Byrd, who recovered six years ago from
paralysis after he broke his neck in a game. His recovery was
termed ``miraculous,'' but the doctor said Sang's injuries were
more severe.
	   Byrd had feeling in his legs almost immediately after the
injury, while Sang has no feeling in her lower body.
	   Despite the diagnosis, Ragnarsson said, Sang's spirits remain
high.
	   She received an emotional boost when ``Titanic'' star Leonardo
DiCaprio visited with her for more than an hour Thursday.
	   ``She didn't need a doctor for that meeting,'' Ragnarsson said.
	   Posters autographed by DiCaprio were hung in her private
hospital room.
	   Her parents, Sang Shisheng and Chen Xiufeng, arrived from China
last week and are staying in the hospital's temporary residence for
relatives of patients.
	   Sang Lan has requested traditional Chinese food, which her
parents have been preparing for her, the doctor said.

Calcutta golf makes du Maurier seem tame
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARRY ATKINS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WINDSOR, Ontario (AP) _ Think you've seen some tough golf
hazards? Try sidestepping cobras. That's how Smriti Mehra learned
the game.
	   Mehra, who shot 3-under-par 69 for a 7-under 137 in the second
round of the LGPA du Maurier Classic on Friday, grew up in
Calcutta. That made golf a complex venture at best.
	   ``Up until three years ago, the only golf equipment you could
buy in the country were tees and golf gloves,'' said Mehra, who
claims to be India's only female professional golfer. ``We'd fly to
Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand or England to buy golf equipment. But
you had to pay 300 percent duty when you brought it back into the
country.''
	   That means if Mehra bought a dlrs 1,000 set of clubs, she had to
fork over another dlrs 3,000 to get it back home.
	   Still, she says, golf is the fastest-growing sport in India.
	   ``It's second in coverage right now, behind only cricket in
popularity,'' Mehra said.
	   Mehra, 26, comes from a golfing family. Her brother's company
runs the Indian PGA Tour and her mother played for India in the
Asian Games.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; TEAM CANADA &LR; : Liz Earley, one of 16 Canadians in the
tournament, admits to getting a little nervous playing in her
homeland. Still, she didn't let it bother her for long.
	   ``I got a little nervous on the first tee when they announce you
being Canadian. I ripped a drive and felt much better after that,''
said Earley, who shot 71 for 138 at Essex Golf and Country Club.
	   Earley is playing her 11th tournament in 12 weeks. Yet the grind
doesn't seem to be bothering her.
	   ``You reach a point where you think you're tired,'' she said.
``But then you start playing well. Like, I'm not tired a bit right
now.''
	   Her solid play easily qualified Earley for the final two rounds
this weekend. Some of the other Canadian women weren't so
fortunate. She was one of four to make the cut which came at 142.
	   Lori Kane, the pride of Prince Edward Island, was in tears in
the scoring tent after missing a putt on her final green. Kane shot
even-par 72 for 143, missing the cut by one stroke.
	   Bobbi Burton, the only amateur in the event, shot 77-78_155.
While that was a bit of a disappointment for the Canadians who
cheered her on, Burton, 20, still went home happy.
	   ``I still have a year and a half of school, so I'm going to do
that,'' Burton said. ``I'm not turning pro any time soon. That's
definitely far off in my future.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; WELCOME BACK &LR; : Deb Richard, who had surgery on her left
shoulder May 23, was pleasantly surprised to shoot 69 for 136.
	   And why not?
	   Richard only returned to the tour last week, shooting 73-74 and
missing the cut in the LPGA Giant Eagle.
	   ``It's funny, because I actually played better last week than I
have this week,'' Richard said. ``But, my mind is fresh and I'm
working hard.''
	   Actually, she might have returned to action a bit sooner. But
the intense heat around her Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., home made it
hard for Richard to recover from surgery.
	   ``I finally went to Maine to get away from the Florida
weather,'' Richard said. ``I worked with my teacher, Peter Kostis.
I could hit balls all day long up there. It was great. Finally, he
said, `Just go play.' I haven't hit it great, but I'm playing
smart.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; U.P. POWER &LR; : Becky Iverson, who grew up playing golf on
Michigan's Upper Peninsula, surged into the title picture with a 66
for 135, three shots off the pace.
	   ``I feel pretty good. But you can't help think of all the lost
opportunities and I had a chance to shoot a really low number
today,'' said Iverson, who lives in Gladstone. ``I'd be a lot
happier if I was at 12-under, or maybe even 13.
	   ``But, it's a major and you just like to keep yourself in it.''
	   Iverson's lone win since joining the tour in 1994 was the 1995
Friendly's Classic.
	   ``Saturday, they always say, is moving day and I think that's
the case,'' Iverson said. ``If I can have another 66 or something
in the third round and put myself in a really good position for
Sunday, it'd be a good weekend.''

Defending champions out, top seeds advance to semis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Age and injury caught up with Karolyn Kirby and
Liz Masakayan at the Goodwill Games.
	   The defending women's beach volleyball champions were eliminated
from the tournament Friday, losing to a Brazilian pair that is
their latest successor as the world's top team.
	   Shelda Bede and Adriana Behar won 15-9 on the Central Park sand,
running off nine straight points largely on crossing serves by
Behar for a 10-1 lead, then scoring four of the last five points to
wrap it up.
	   ``What happened at the beginning of the game for them to get a
big lead is exactly what happened at the end of the game when they
got their last points,'' the 33-year-old Masakayan said.
	   In between those two runs, the San Diego pair scored seven of
eight points with play that brought back visions of their days at
the top: an ace, three kills and a block by Kirby, and pressure
behind Masakayan's serve.
	   ``Once we started getting points, it was really the old Liz and
Karolyn started coming back, where we started gaining some
confidence and we had something we could work with,'' the
37-year-old Kirby said. ``It's just too bad we didn't think of that
a little bit earlier.''
	   With just one win in three preliminary matches, Masakayan and
Kirby still had a slim chance of advancing to Saturday's
semifinals. That evaporated when Pauline Manser and Kerri Pottharst
of Australia beat winless Kristine Drakich and Guylaine Dumont of
Canada 15-8 to reach the final four.
	   ``It would have been nice,'' Kirby said.
	   Kirby and Masakayan dominated the Women's Pro Volleyball
Association tour in the mid-1990s, taking 13 straight tournaments
at one point. They won the gold medal in the 1994 Goodwill Games
and reached the final of the world championship that year, before
things started to go bad.
	   Masakayan tore a knee ligament in that tournament and had to
have surgery. She snapped her kneecap nine months later, forcing
her sixth knee operation. Kirby had shoulder surgery in 1997.
	   They played with different partners for a while and watched the
U.S. pro league fold. Now they are together again, rekindling
memories if not repeating results. Kirby called it ``kind of
nostalgic.''

Stottlemyre, Clayton, Zeile to Texas, Guzman to Baltimore _ Big
</HEADLINE>
Unit next? &QL; 
 &UR; By BEN WALKER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Baseball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Trade rumors turned into reality Friday with
Todd Stottlemyre, Royce Clayton and Todd Zeile going to the Texas
Rangers and Juan Guzman, Willie Blair and Ellis Burks also
switching teams.
	   But as the non-waiver trading deadline of midnight EDT (0400
GMT) approached, all of U.S. Major League Baseball was still
waiting and watching for one big deal: Would the Seattle Mariners
move Randy Johnson?
	   The New York Yankees, Cleveland, Los Angeles and Atlanta were
said to be pursuing the 1995 AL Cy Young winner.
	   Texas, meanwhile, turned down a chance to get four-time Cy Young
winner Roger Clemens after Toronto insisted on obtaining outfielder
Rusty Greer.
	   By early Friday evening, there had already been six trades. And
there was speculation more would follow, with the names of Randy
Myers, Roberto Hernandez, Denny Neagle and Robin Ventura mentioned
most prominently.
	   The Rangers, who began the day one game behind Anaheim in the AL
West, got busy early. They acquired Stottlemyre and Clayton from
St. Louis for pitcher Darren Oliver and third baseman Fernando
Tatis, and got Zeile from Florida for a pair of minor leaguers.
	   Stottlemyre, 33, was 9-9 this season with a 3.51 ERA. Clayton,
28, who became Ozzie Smith's successor at shortstop in St. Louis,
slumped to .234 this year with four homers and 29 RBIs.
	   Stottlemyre and Clayton are both eligible for free agency at the
end of the season.
	   Oliver, 27, was 6-7 with a 6.53 ERA in 19 starts for Texas.
Tatis, 23, is hitting .270 with three homers and 32 RBIs.
	   Zeile was traded for the second time this season, having gone
from Los Angeles to Florida in May as part of the deal involving
Mike Piazza. At the time, the Marlins told the third baseman they
would try to move him shortly.
	   Zeile, 32, is hitting .276 with 13 homers and 66 RBIs.
	   Baltimore, eight games behind Boston in the AL wild-card chase,
acquired Guzman from Toronto for pitcher Nerio Rodriguez and minor
league outfielder Shannon Carter.
	   Guzman, 31, was 6-12 with a 4.41 ERA. He pitched eight strong
innings Thursday night in a 1-0 win over Texas, then said he
expected to be traded at any moment.
	   The San Francisco Giants, bidding for the NL wild-card spot,
traded Darryl Hamilton, minor league pitcher James Stoops and a
player to be named to Colorado for Burks in a swap of 33-year-old
outfielders.
	   In a swap of slumping players, the New York Mets traded
outfielder Bernard Gilkey to the Arizona Diamondbacks for Blair,
who leads the majors in losses.
	   As part of the deal, New York also sent minor league pitcher
Nelson Figueroa and cash to the Diamondbacks. The Mets also will
receive catcher Jorge Fabregas and a player to be named.
	   In a minor deal, the Boston Red Sox traded pitcher Joe Hudson to
the Milwaukee Brewers for infielder Eddy Diaz. Boston made the move
one day after getting Mike Stanley from Toronto for two pitching
prospects.

Duval, Morgan lead field in Utah Showdown; Bench bats a 78
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG BEACHAM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ Bob Duval plays his best golf when his
son is in the gallery. Of course, PGA pro David Duval usually has
other commitments.
	   David was able to make it to the Utah Showdown this week, and
his father responded with a 6-under-par 66. He tied Gil Morgan for
the lead after the first day of the 54-hole tournament at Park
Meadows Country Club.
	   ``I'm going to see if he wants to quit his tour and follow me
around,'' Bob Duval joked. He recorded his first top-10 finish on
the Senior PGA Tour in the Showdown last year _ again with his son
in the gallery. ``I just play well when he's here and we're
together.''
	   Morgan and Duval were a dozen strokes better than Johnny Bench,
who carded a 78 in his debut on the senior tour. The baseball Hall
of Famer received a sponsor's exemption into the Showdown, and he
stumbled with two double bogeys on the back nine of an otherwise
solid round.
	   ``I'm pleased with the way I played,'' Bench said. ``I'm a
rookie just trying to do the best I can. I wasn't intimidated, but
it was definitely a different experience.''
	   Bob Duval, who never played on the PGA Tour, birdied three of
the last four holes on the day, but it was a looping 50-foot
(15-meter) eagle putt on the eighth hole that kick-started his
round.
	   ``That's one of those lucky putts that makes you think maybe
it's your day,'' Duval said.
	   Morgan didn't decide to enter the Showdown until earlier this
week. It's looking like a good decision. Morgan, who has won five
times on the Senior PGA Tour this year, roared into the clubhouse
with four straight birdies.
	   ``It was a last-minute decision to come here,'' Morgan said.
``But several players told me it was a great course and a great
event, so I thought I'd give it a shot.''
	   Morgan, No. 2 on the tour's money list behind no-show Hale
Irwin, played a steady round with a fantastic finish. After two
birdies and 12 pars on the first 14 holes, he birdied the last four
holes and finished with a twisting 30-foot (9-meter) putt on the
18th.
	   Morgan hasn't played in Utah since 1984, but he entered after
last week's U.S. Senior Open to boost a lackluster field in a
tournament that could be knocked off the tour schedule next year
because of sponsorship troubles.
	   ``The tournament was needing some help,'' said Morgan, who leads
the senior tour in the all-around rankings. ``I came in here not
knowing what to expect. Hopefully, I'm learning as I go forward.''
	   Morgan and Duval finished the day two strokes ahead of Jerry
McGee and John Jacobs. McGee is still looking for his first senior
victory.
	   Jacobs, the senior tour's longest driver, took advantage of Park
Meadows' wet fairways and supple greens. He's hunting for his
second victory of the year after taking his first in the Nationwide
Championship in early June.
	   ``For a while it looked like I was going to (score) 72 and be
very depressed, but now it's a 68 and I'm happy,'' Jacobs said.
``Hopefully the course favors a guy that hits like me.''
	   Dave Stockton, who has won the Showdown twice and finished
second twice in the last five years, carded a 2-under-par 70 to tie
him with Isao Aoki and 11 others.

	   Here is a summary of late news from The Associated Press.
Stories carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items
below have moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   WASHINGTON _ President Bill Clinton, commenting publicly for the
first time about his Aug. 17 testimony, said he will ``completely
and truthfully'' answer prosecutors' questions about Monica
Lewinsky. ``I am anxious to do it,'' he said. As his investigation
enters a crucial phase, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr
eliminated one past path of criticism by taking an unpaid leave
from his private law firm. He had juggled both jobs for nearly four
years. ``Mr. Starr said he wanted to fulfill his moral commitment
to his private clients, which he has done, and he is taking an
unpaid leave of absence from the firm until he has completed his
public duties,'' said spokesman Charles Bakaly. Meanwhile, new
information emerged about the dark blue cocktail dress that Ms.
Lewinsky turned over earlier this week. An initial examination by
the FBI identified a recognizable stain that can be further tested
as possible evidence of a sexual encounter, sources said.
(US-CLINTON-CONTROVERSY)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Relief workers are preparing to test
President Slobodan Milosevic's promise that they can deliver
humanitarian aid to ethnic Albanians who fled recent fighting and
ensure they can return safely to their homes . U.S. special envoy
Christopher Hill said Milosevic told him Friday he would take
``personal responsibility'' for letting U.N. and other aid workers
deliver food, medicine, blankets and other supplies to Albanians
hiding in forested hills after Serb forces drove the Kosovo
Liberation Army from several strongholds. In New York, a senior
official of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Kabra
Mbaidjol, said security concerns were hampering efforts to reach an
estimated 20,000 refugees. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa _ A public exploration into the decades
of massacres, beatings and torture that marked South Africa's
apartheid-era ended Friday after two years of often painful
testimony. Before closing its hearings into human rights abuses
committed during the years of white minority rule, the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission heard from one final witness, a man
dubbed ``Dr. Death'' by the local media. Wouter Basson, who headed
a secret program to devise chemical and biological weapons aimed at
South Africa's blacks, countered on Friday many of the charges
leveled against him. Scientists in June testified about poisoning
shirts and chocolates, trying to poison President Nelson Mandela,
who spent 27 years as a prisoner of the white-run state, and
searching for a bacteria that would affect only blacks. (SOUTH
AFRICA-RECKONING)
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica _ Physically fatigued but ideologically
unfazed, Fidel Castro predicted a world financial collapse that
would lead to a more just society. ``We have no doubt the present
world order is going to go into a crisis,'' Castro told several
hundred ordinary Jamaicans whom he met before flying on to
Barbados. ``There will have to be a new world, a different world
with a new culture, because we know that culture cannot be the
culture of the consumer society.'' Castro, on the third day of a
triumphant Jamaican stop, said that the 1994 Mexico currency
crisis, last year's Asian crisis, the economic turmoil in Russia
and the prolonged Japanese stagnation all pointed to a global
failure of capitalism. (JAMAICA-CASTRO)
	   TOKYO _ Promising a fresh approach to solving his country's
pressing economic problems, Japan's new prime minister said Friday
his government will take prompt action to kick start growth and fix
the debt-ridden banking system. ``This will be a fresh new Cabinet
that will strive with all its might to take decisive, speedy action
to deal with difficult problems,'' Keizo Obuchi said in his first
news conference since being elected premier by Parliament on
Thursday. No sooner had Obuchi spoken than new signs appeared
Friday of just how bad Japan's economy has gotten: The government
announced that Japan's unemployment rate surged to 4.3 percent in
June, up from two consecutive months at 4.1 percent. The June
figure is the highest since the government began its current system
of compiling unemployment data in 1953. (JAPAN-POLITICS)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A late burst of panicky selling cut short
another rebound Friday, nearly slicing 200 more points off the Dow
and extending the stock market's two-week slump. The Dow Jones
industrial average finished 143.66 points _ or 1.6 percent _ lower
at 8,883.29, after falling as much as 198 points during the
pre-weekend plunge. The barometer of 30 blue-chip companies now
sits about 455 points below the record close of 9,337.97 set just
two weeks ago on July 17. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. economy's production of goods and
services slowed sharply in the April-June quarter, hurt by lost
trade to Asia and a prolonged strike at General Motors, the largest
corporation in the United States. The gross domestic product _ the
sum of goods and services produced within U.S. borders _ increased
at a modest 1.4 percent annual rate, the Commerce Department said
Friday. That's down sharply from the torrid 5.5 percent rate during
the first three months of the year. Nevertheless, it wasn't nearly
as bad as many analysts expected because business and consumer
spending remained healthy. Some had thought the economy's output
actually had decreased for the first time since the 1990-91
recession rather than just moderated. (US-ECONOMY)
	   LONDON (AP) _ The plan by two German automakers to divide
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars prompted the company's chief executive to
resign Friday, bringing further uncertainty to the luxury car
maker. Graham Morris said the shakeup announced by Volkswagen AG,
which bought the factory, and rival BMW, which bought the
Rolls-Royce brand name, made his position untenable. Morris'
departure was the second sensational loss of the week for VW, which
conceded Tuesday it will have to let its archrival BMW take over
production of Rolls-Royces in a few years. VW paid 479 million
pounds (dlrs 790 million) for Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, but it will
end up with only the Rolls-Royce factory in Crewe, England, as well
as the lesser-known but better-selling Bentley line of luxury cars.
(BRITAIN-ROLLS ROYCE)
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Volkswagen and BMW, the two German automakers
planning to divide Rolls-Royce, could ensure a close relationship
by exchanging shares in their companies, Volkswagen chief Ferdinand
Piech said Friday. In an interview for Saturday's edition of Die
Welt daily, Piech declined to comment on recent German media
reports that Volkswagen and BMW were considering an eventual full
merger. But Piech was quoted as saying that each of the two German
automakers could consider selling a minority share of 24.9 percent
to the other. The companies battled each other this year to buy
Rolls-Royce, with Volkswagen ending up with the British factory
that builds the cars for dlrs 790 million and BMW with rights to
the brand name for dlrs 66 million. (GERMANY-VOLKSWAGEN-BMW)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A senior International Monetary Fund official
returned to Moscow on Friday to press Russia to enact economic
reforms that were demanded in exchange for a huge international
loan. The IMF denied the fund is considering further loans to
Russia, whose markets remain skittish despite the promised dlrs
22.6 billion cash infusion. Both the ruble and the stock market
closed slightly lower Friday, reflecting continued uncertainty
about the government's ability to address fundamental problems in
the economy. Stanley Fischer, first deputy managing director of the
IMF, was scheduled to hold talks Friday and Saturday with Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, his finance minister and the chairman of
the Central Bank about cutting spending and improving tax
collection. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lloyd's of London won a legal victory Friday that
lets it go after 150 million pounds (dlrs 245 million) from some
500 investors who lost a fortune in the insurance market but don't
want to pay up. The investors, known as ``names,'' are individuals
who, in keeping with three centuries of tradition at Lloyd's, had
put up their entire personal wealth as collateral to back the
company's insurance policies. When the market lost some 8 billion
pounds (dlrs 13 billion) in a disastrous period from 1988-92, many
of the names complained they had been cheated by Lloyd's insiders
and refused to pay their bills. Lloyd's won a judgment against the
investors in March, and on Friday the Court of Appeal refused to
let the names fight their case any further, saying that ``would
have served no legitimate purpose.'' (BRITAIN-LLOYD'S OF LONDON)

	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Taking his crusade for an end to the
U.S. embargo against Cuba on the road, Fidel Castro warned of a
world financial while visiting his Caribbean neighbors.
	   ``We have no doubt the present world order is going to go into a
crisis,'' Castro told several hundred ordinary Jamaicans whom he
met before flying on to Barbados. ``There will have to be a new
world, a different world with a new culture, because we know that
culture cannot be the culture of the consumer society.''
	   Castro, on the third and last day of a triumphant Jamaican stop,
said that the 1994 Mexico currency crisis, last year's Asian
crisis, the economic turmoil in Russia and the prolonged Japanese
stagnation all pointed to a global failure of capitalism.
	   Later, at a news conference, Castro and Jamaican Prime Minister
P.J. Patterson outlined a new role for the Non-Aligned Movement of
more than 100 developing nations, which has been essentially
without a cause since losing its role as a third voice after the
two superpowers during the Cold War.
	   ``We see it as a framework for dialogue and cooperation among
developing countries... an avenue for ensuring respect for
principles which offer protection to small and vulnerable states,''
Patterson said.
	   During the news conference, Castro lost his temper with a
journalist for Miami's Channel 23 who described the social chasm
between Cubans who have access to hard currency and those who do
not as ``dollar apartheid.''
	   ``You make assertions because you don't know what apartheid
is,'' he shouted. ``You're too white to know that!''
	   Castro then to flew Barbados, where he will honor the 73 victims
of the 1976 bombing of a Cuban jetliner.
	   At the airport near Bridgetown he was to meet with Prime
Minister Owen Arthur, who plans to join his guest in leading a
procession at dawn Saturday to commemorate the 160th anniversary of
the emancipation of Barbadian slaves.
	   On Sunday Castro proceeds to his third and last stop, Grenada.
	   All three islands on Castro's unprecedented tour once shunned
the Communist leader but now are leading a campaign to soften the
U.S. position on Cuba _ a reflection of general bitterness about
U.S. economic policy in the region.
	   Castro has cast himself as a champion of the economically
vulnerable island nations of the Caribbean, charging that U.S.
policies have caused factories to leave the area, cost thousands of
jobs and threaten its limited trade.
	   Earlier, in Kingston, Castro stood in meditation at the
graveside of former Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley. Dressed
in a dark business suit, he laid a flower wreath dedicated ``to the
unforgettable friend.''
	   Outside the cemetery Friday, a few dozen people gathered
carrying homemade signs welcoming Castro. ``Love that man! Love
that man!'' said one of them, Elaine Green. ``The times are
changing _ when is the United States going to change?''
	   By contrast, little fanfare accompanied Castro's visit in
Barbados, as most ``Bajans'' focused on their Cropover carnival.
	   Several callers to local radio stations protested Castro's
participation in the Emancipation Day proceedings, saying full
freedom starts at home _ a reference to human rights conditions in
Cuba.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Relief workers are preparing to test
President Slobodan Milosevic's promise that they can deliver
humanitarian aid to ethnic Albanians who fled recent fighting.
	   U.S. special envoy Christopher Hill said Milosevic told him
Friday he would take ``personal responsibility'' for letting U.N.
and other aid workers deliver food, medicine, blankets and other
supplies to Albanians hiding in forested hills after Serb forces
drove the Kosovo Liberation Army from several strongholds.
	   In New York, a senior official of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, Kabra Mbaidjol, said security concerns were hampering
efforts to reach an estimated 20,000 refugees.
	   U.N. officials said they would try to organize a relief convoy
as soon as possible to reach a group of at least 500 refugees
located near the hamlet of Mirusa.
	   Those refugees _ including old men, women and five newborns _
escaped from Malisevo, a former KLA stronghold which fell to Serb
police earlier this week.
	   ``The people there said they were afraid of going back to
Malisevo or anywhere else and spoke about hearing gunfire and
shellings during the past two nights,'' a U.N. statement said.
	   Hill told reporters that Milosevic had also promised to allow
international observers to escort the refugees back to their homes
to prevent abuse by Serb police or local authorities.
	   Milosevic assured a European Union delegation Thursday that the
week-long offensive was over. But he made no pledge to withdraw
Serb forces from Kosovo, a province of Serbia where Albanians form
90 percent of the 2 million inhabitants.
	   The KLA and Albanian politicians want independence for Kosovo _
a province of Serbia, the dominate of two republics which form
Yugoslavia.
	   Despite Milosevic's pledge to halt the offensive, Serb and
Albanian sources reported scattered clashes Friday. The
government's Tanjug news agency said Albanian ``terrorists'' were
killed and several were arrested Friday when they attacked Serb
police near Lipljane, some 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of
Pristina.
	   Three Serb policemen were seriously wounded, the report said.
	   The Albanian-controlled Kosovo Information Center also reported
fighting near Junik, a KLA stronghold near the Albanian border.
Albanian officials said about 30 refugees _ mostly women and
children _ fled into Albania on Friday from the Junik area.
	   Western diplomats say the Serb offensive has complicated efforts
to organize an Albanian delegation to negotiate Kosovo's future
with the government.
	   Diplomats and others said the KLA was expected to announce next
week whether it would approve such a delegation. On Friday, KLA
spokesman Jakup Krasniqi told Albanian state television that Serb
forces would ``never bring the KLA to its knees.''
	   The KLA has been resisting international calls to unite behind
moderate Albanian politician Ibrahim Rugova, who opposes violence.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Barry Rosen says his decision to meet with one of
the men who planned the capture of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran was
his biggest dilemma in nearly two decades.
	   In the end, he shook hands with his former captor, Abbas Abdi.
	   The two met as private citizens. But both said they hope their
Friday encounter will help Iran and the United States turn the page
in a relationship poisoned by the Embassy seizure that trapped 52
Americans for 444 days.
	   Still, the pain ran deep, on both sides.
	   Abdi, listing grievances against the United States that date to
1953, refused to apologize for the storming of the Embassy on Nov.
4, 1979.
	   And Rosen, 54, made clear he cannot forget.
	   ``But this platform is not for remembering only my pain, or
blows to American honor,'' Rosen said in opening remarks.
``Iranians also suffered deeply ....
	   ``I'm here with Mr. Abdi because I want to see Americans and
Iranians turn that difficult corner away from mutual demonizing.''
Both peoples need to ``humanize'' each other to achieve real
dialogue, said Rosen, once a Peace Corps volunteer in Iran.
	   The more than three-hour meeting in a hall at UNESCO, organized
by the Center for World Dialogue based in Cyprus, was what Rosen
called a ``baby step'' on the road to reconciliation.
	   ``The past cannot be altered,'' Abdi said. ``Instead, we must
focus on the years ahead and endeavor to build a better future
which is unquestionably within our capabilities.''
	   Angry students seized the compound in the heart of Tehran to
protest the American decision to allow Shah Mohamed Reza Pahlavi,
deposed nine months earlier and dying of cancer, to seek medical
treatment in the United States.
	   The students thought the occupation would last ``no more than a
week,'' Abdi said, adding that the seizure ``was the most
nonviolent possible measure taken ... in response to what the
United States had done.''
	   Abdi, 42, now a senior editor at the previously hard-line
newspaper Salaam, acknowledged that he was among those who planned
the event.
	   But he refused to apologize.
	   ``I could be taken hostage for 444 days,'' Abdi said. ``This I
could overlook.
	   ``But taking a nation hostage for 25 years,'' he said, ``needs
more apologies.''
	   The hostage crisis was but ``a row of bricks in this tall wall
(of mistrust),'' Abdi said. He said the wall's foundation was laid
in 1953, with the U.S.-backed coup that toppled President Mohamed
Mossaddegh and returned the shah to the Peacock Throne.
	   On a symbolic level, the encounter brought full circle the
changes that have taken place in Iran since the 1979 revolution
that established the Islamic Republic.
	   Several people with roles in the hostage crisis now have
government posts, including the woman who served as spokeswoman and
translator, known then only as ``Sister Mary.'' Now, she is vice
president for environmental affairs, Massoumeh Ebtekar.
	   Iran has considerably softened its attitude toward the United
States since the election last year of Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami.
	   Khatami's appeal in January for a ``crack in the wall of
mistrust'' provided a timid opening for both sides.
	   Last month, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright acknowledged
the wide schism between Tehran and Washington but said that ``it is
time to test the possibilities for bridging this gap.''
	   But rancor runs deep, dividing even Iranians.
	   The session was interrupted three times by outbursts from
members of the audience, including two Iranians who denounced Abdi
as a ``mass murderer'' and a ``terrorist.'' They were forcibly
removed from the hall.
	   In Tehran, hardline opponents of Khatami would like to scuttle
any rapprochement.
	   Initial plans to hold the meeting in London were canceled when
Britain refused Abdi a visa, according to Hooshang Amirahmadi,
president of the American-Iranian Council, of Princeton, New
Jersey.
	   At the end of the session, Rosen and Abdi were asked if they
would shake hands. They stood up and moved toward each other.
	   ``I have no problems shaking hands with Mr. Rosen,'' Abdi said.
	   Rosen was silent as he clasped Abdi's hand.
	   The State Department said it viewed Friday's encounter as ``a
positive development in the people-to-people dialogue that both
nations support ....''
	   There was no immediate response from Iran.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The head of Mexico's governing party charged
that two U.S. diplomats, briefly detained in a remote village, were
in Mexico illegally and meddling in the country's affairs.
	   The comments by Mariano Palacios Alcocer, prominently reported
by many Mexican newspapers on Friday, added still more heat to a
furor over the detention of the diplomats and about the role of
foreigners in Chiapas, where the government is trying to quell a
revolt.
	   Pro-government villagers in Los Platanos, apparently tense from
recent conflicts with Zapatista rebels, detained two U.S. military
attaches for four hours on Sunday because the two would not allow
their bags to be searched.
	   In recent months President Ernesto Zedillo's government has
crusaded against foreign involvement in Chiapas, apparently trying
to strip away outside support for the Zapatistas and their
charismatic leader, Subcomandante Marcos.
	   The discovery of a U.S. military attache touring Chiapas roused
the suspicion of Mexico's left as well as nationalists always wary
of U.S. intentions.
	   ___
	   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) _ A passenger on a bus in this popular
Pacific resort was arrested when police found he was carrying a
plastic bag with limes and a human skull.
	   Police said Hermenegildo Garcia Gonzanez, 50, admitted on
Thursday that the skull had been taken from a cemetery southeast of
Acapulco. He was held on charges of desecrating a body and improper
exhumation.
	   Police said he told them he was a witch and planned to use the
skull for a ceremony. He did not say what he intended to do with
the limes.
	   ___
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ A 25-year-long
religious dispute has heated up with the expulsion of about 70
Protestants from the traditional Indian municipality of Chamula.
	   The expulsions, announced late Thursday, appear to end a period
of relative calm in the conflict that has seen some 15,000 people
expelled from Chamula by leaders enforcing a unique mix of Catholic
and Maya religious traditions.
	   Abdias Tovilla Jaime, president of the independent Evangelical
Defense Committee, said word of the expulsions was delayed because
the victims, fearful of further reprisals, did not immediately
report them.
	   Those expelled this week are evangelical Protestants _ a rapidly
growing force in Chiapas. But some Roman Catholics have also been
forced out of Chamula and village leaders place strict limits on
visiting Catholic priests.
	   Repeated efforts by state and federal officials have sometimes
brought a pause in the expulsions, but they have failed to solve a
conflict that pits an Indian village defending its endangered
culture against the right to freedom of religion.
	   Chamula's religion blends Catholicism with Mayan beliefs and
practices, which include the sipping of a potent alcohol called
posh during prayers in the township's only permitted church.
	   ___
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Two ministers resigned from the Chilean
government Friday after President Eduardo Frei said he was planning
a cabinet shuffle for the final stage of his term.
	   Public Works Minister Ricardo Lagos, widely expected to seek the
pro-government coalition's presidential nomination in next year's
election, quit along with Economy Minister Alvaro Garcia. More
changes were expected shortly.
	   Both Lagos and Garcia are members of the Socialist Party.
	   There was no indication immediately on when Frei would announce
the changes, which according to local media reports were to include
the key Interior and Defense portfolios, and the presidential
chief-of-staff.
	   Frei was expected to meet later in the day with the leaders of
the four parties in his coalition prior to making a final
announcement.
	   Lagos' departure from the post he has held since 1994 was
considered the most politically important because of his probable
presidential nomination. His main rival is Sen. Andres Zaldivar, a
member of Frei's Christian Democratic Party.

	   CANCUN, Mexico (AP) _ The balmy Caribbean coast may not have
been as kind to 18th century sailors as it is to modern tourists:
Authorities reported that a 1 1/2-ton cannon found near Cancun
indicates a ship at least 230 feet (70 meters) long sank in the
area in the 1700s.
	   Fishermen found the 8-foot (2.6-meter) cannon in the Isla
Mujeres Bay Tuesday. Smaller ships of the era couldn't have carried
such a heavy weapon, according to officials of the National
Institute of History and Archeology.
	   The fishermen tried to sell the cannon, but authorities seized
the item after hearing of the plan. Unauthorized sales of
historical objects are illegal in Mexico.
	   The institute took charge of the cannon, and said it will send
divers to the wreck if the fishermen say where the cannon was
found.
	   The very qualities that make Mexico's Caribbean coast attractive
_ long, sloping beaches, shallow water and coral reefs _ made it a
perilous but much-used route for Spanish galleons and English,
French and Dutch buccaneers in the 1700s.

	   LE CREUSOT, France (AP) _ Only two more days remain for the Tour
de France _ Saturday's time trial and Sunday's ride into Paris.
	   In the past, the time trial would have suspense and the last
day's ride would have the air of a ceremonial parade ending
triumphantly on the Champs Elysees.
	   Now, with only 14 of 21 teams and under 100 riders remaining,
the Tour will limp into the final weekend.
	   This year, with drug revelations, searches and charges nearly
every day since the start of the Tour nearly three weeks ago, the
end could not come soon enough.
	   For the first time since the doping scandal began three weeks
ago, a rider was placed under formal investigation, a step short of
being charged.
	   Rodolfo Massi of Italy, who was the leading mountain climber in
the Tour before police detained him before the start of the 18th
stage, was put under formal investigaion by judicial authorities in
Lille, a step short of being charged.
	   Meanwhile the Tour goes on.
	   Marco Pantani is in the lead by more than five minutes entering
Saturday's 52-kilometer (32.3-mile) time trial.
	   In any other year, the stage would be full of suspense, even
with Pantani's 5:43 lead over American Bobby Julich and 5:56 over
defending champion Jan Ullrich.
	   ``Nothing is won yet,'' said Pantani. ``I need to stay
concentrated.''
	   Julich of Glenwood Springs, Colo., hopes he'll be on the
podium's second step as the runner-up.
	   Julich is barely ahead of Ullrich, who beat Julich by more than
a minute in the last time trial and Pantani by more than four.
	   ``Those 14 seconds are very, very important,'' Julich said of
the gap between him and Ullrich after the 19th stage. ``I expect a
big battle for second.''
	   Magnus Backstedt won the Friday's stage. Backstedt made a bit of
history by becoming the first Swede to win in the Tour since it
began in 1903.
	   However this year's Tour will hardly be remembered for that.
	   The drug scandal cast an even darker shadow on the Tour that has
continued to lose riders out of protest or due to allegations.
	   The Dutch team TVM pulled out of the race Friday morning, bring
the total to six of the teams that have pulled out in anger at
police tactics. Another one, Festina, was expelled on July 17 after
its officials admitted to systematic doping.
	   More legal action in the drug probe came Friday when authorities
placed Massi under formal investigation, along with Dr. Nicolas
Terrados Cepada of the Spanish team ONCE.
	   It was the first time in the probe that authorities had taken
such action against a rider. Altogether, five people have been
placed under formal investigation since the Tour began.

Mets trade Gilkey to Arizona for Blair

<TEXT>
	   PHOENIX (AP) _ Shaking up the roster for their wild card run,
the New York Mets traded slumping outfielder Bernard Gilkey to the
expansion Arizona Diamondbacks on Friday for right-hander Willie
Blair, who leads the majors in losses.
	   As part of the deal, New York also sent minor league
right-hander Nelson Figueroa and cash to the Diamondbacks. The Mets
also will receive catcher Jorge Fabregas and a player to be named.
	   Gilkey, 31, was hitting .227 in 82 games with the Mets this
season. He sustained a stress fracture in his left elbow early this
year and was on the disabled list from April 26 to May 11.
	   ``Bernard Gilkey was struggling last year and had a great month
of September. He never got it going again after his elbow injury,''
Mets general manager Steve Phillips said.
	   Gilkey is in the second year of a dlrs 20.4 million, four-year
contract he signed after his best season in 1996, when he hit .317
with 44 doubles and 30 homers.
	   ``It's a good chance for me to start over and start playing ball
the way I can,'' Gilkey said. ``It started getting crowded in the
outfield. I wasn't playing as much as I wanted.''
	   That said, Gilkey was sorry to be leaving New York.
	   ``The team is playing well here and I thought I was going to be
a part of it,'' Gilkey said.
	   Arizona general manager Joe Garagiola Jr. said he thinks Gilkey
will benefit from a change of scenery.
	   ``He's consistently through his career been a .280 hitter, a
70-80 RBI guy and there's absolutely no reason that at age 31 he
can't produce those same numbers for us,'' Garagiola said.
	   Blair, 32, signed an dlrs 11.5 million, three-year contract with
Arizona last winter after going 16-8 with a 4.17 ERA for Detroit in
1997. But he was just 4-15 with a 5.34 ERA in 23 starts for Arizona
and often was the victim of a lack of offensive support, finally
complaining openly after a recent loss.
	   Fabregas, 28, was batting .199 in 50 games with Arizona.

The Dream _ not Team _ makes appearance at world championship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The Dream Team might not be here for the
World Basketball Championship, but The Dream is.
	   Hakeem ``The Dream'' Olajuwon took time out of his summer
vacation to drop by Olympic arena and watch his native Nigeria play
Australia Friday night in a preliminary round game.
	   ``I think the team is playing very well here. We have a lot of
size and talent,'' the Houston Rockets center said. ``It's the kind
of team that will get better with competition.''
	   Olajuwon, a certain National Basketball Association Hall of
Famer, worked out with the team Friday morning.
	   ``I was just trying to encourage them,'' he said.
	   Nigeria did play its best game of the tournament, but could not
stay with Australia and lost 70-64, assuring the Africans no better
than a 13th-place finish out of 16 countries.
	   Olajuwon also had the chance to speak with U.S. coach Rudy
Tomjanovich, his boss at the Rockets. The pair won two NBA titles
earlier this decade.
	   The player said it's too bad the NBA labor dispute led to the
dumping of the Dream Team's collection of stars.
	   ``It changes the whole tournament,'' Olajuwon said. ``Those
players would have brought excitement to Greece, to the world of
basketball.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   TAKE TWO ASPIRIN ...: &LR;  Italy has not been as impressive as many
expected it to be here, and that's mostly attributable to Carlton
Myers' poor health.
	   The slick guard, who plays with former NBA great Dominique
Wilkins at TeamSystem Bologna in the Italian League, made his first
appearance Friday in a 79-69 win over Canada.
	   Myers missed the team's first two games with a fever and sore
throat and said he's still not 100 percent.
	   ``If I'm going to play like that for the rest of the games I
might as well go home,'' the London-born Myers said after scoring
11 points in 24 minutes against Canada. He shot just 2-for-9 from
the field.
	   Myers, whose mother is Italian, moved to the Mediterranean
country when he was 10.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   VITAMINS?: &LR;  Nigerian center Julius Nwosu said it was a vitamin
supplement called Up The Gas that resulted in his positive doping
test and suspension from the worlds.
	   ``I have a knee injury and so the solution is either to drink a
lot of milk or take the vitamins,'' Nwosu said Friday at halftime
of Nigeria's loss.
	   He sat on the bench in street clothes, hours after FIBA, the
sport's governing body, announced the punishment.
	   ``That's FIBA, you can't fight FIBA,'' said Nwosu, who played
briefly in the NBA and minor-league Continental Basketball
Association. ``I'm always clean. It's just been blown out of
proportion.''
	   FIBA said he tested positive for ephedrine, a banned stimulant
typically found in cold medication.
	   Only once before has a player tested positive at the worlds.
Egypt's Mohammed Ashraf was banned for two years after failing a
doping test at the 1994 tournament.

Clarke says Lindros must perform to stay
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Eric Lindros must start performing if he
wants to be the National Hockey League's highest paid player,
Philadelphia Flyers general manager Bob Clarke said.
	   Lindros signed a contract extension in December that will pay
him dlrs 8.5 million next season, but he and the Flyers have said
they want to negotiate a new multiyear deal.
	   In his most candid comments since the deal was struck, Clarke
said Lindros must pick up the level of his game.
	   ``If you want to be the highest-paid player in the game or close
to it, you've got to play that way,'' Clarke told The Philadelphia
Inquirer in Friday's editions. ``You're not a kid anymore. He's 25
years old, and he's been in the league six years. It's time.''
	   Last year, Lindros had 30 goals and 41 assists for 71 points in
63 games. His career totals are 223 goals, 284 assists and 507
points in 360 games.
	   Carl Lindros, Eric's father and agent, had no comment on
Clarke's remarks. He did say he expected his son to get a new
contract.
	   Addressing rumors, Clarke said he has never told Carl Lindros
that Eric would be traded.
	   ``I've never said that to Carl, but if there's a change on the
landscape and we can't get Eric signed, then, yes,'' he would be
traded, Clarke said.
	   Lindros, the NHL MVP in 1994-95, came to the Flyers in 1992,
after the NHL's first overall draft choice in 1991 sat out a season
rather than play for the team that selected him, the Quebec
Nordiques.
	   The Flyers sent six players, two first-round draft choices and
dlrs 16 million to Quebec for the rights to Lindros.

Defending champions out, top seeds advance to semis

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with McPeak-Arce victory &QL; 
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC;

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Age and injury caught up with Karolyn Kirby and
Liz Masakayan at the Goodwill Games.
	   The defending women's beach volleyball champions were eliminated
from the tournament Friday, losing to a Brazilian pair that is
their latest successor as the world's top team.
	   Shelda Bede and Adriana Behar won 15-9 on the Central Park sand,
running off nine straight points largely on crossing serves by
Behar for a 10-1 lead, then scoring four of the last five points to
wrap it up.
	   ``What happened at the beginning of the game for them to get a
big lead is exactly what happened at the end of the game when they
got their last points,'' the 33-year-old Masakayan said.
	   In between those two runs, the San Diego pair scored seven of
eight points with play that brought back visions of their days at
the top: an ace, three kills and a block by Kirby, and pressure
behind Masakayan's serve.
	   ``Once we started getting points, it was really the old Liz and
Karolyn started coming back, where we started gaining some
confidence and we had something we could work with,'' the
37-year-old Kirby said. ``It's just too bad we didn't think of that
a little bit earlier.''
	   With just one win in three preliminary matches, Masakayan and
Kirby still had a slim chance of advancing to Saturday's
semifinals. That evaporated when Pauline Manser and Kerri Pottharst
of Australia beat winless Kristine Drakich and Guylaine Dumont of
Canada 15-8 to reach the final four.
	   ``It would have been nice,'' Kirby said.
	   There will be an American team in the semifinals.
	   Holly McPeak and Lisa Arce of Manhattan Beach, California,
defeated Maike Friedrichsen and Danja Musch of Germany 15-11.
	   They will meet Manser and Pottharst, while Bede and Bahar face
Italy's Laura Bruschini and Annamaria Solazzi, who beat Eva Celbova
and Sona Dosoudilova of the Czech Republic 15-7.
	   Kirby and Masakayan dominated the Women's Pro Volleyball
Association tour in the mid-1990s, taking 13 straight tournaments
at one point. They won the gold medal in the 1994 Goodwill Games
and reached the final of the world championship that year, before
things started to go bad.
	   Masakayan tore a knee ligament in that tournament and had to
have surgery. She snapped her kneecap nine months later, forcing
her sixth knee operation. Kirby had shoulder surgery in 1997.
	   They played with different partners for a while and watched the
U.S. pro league fold. Now they are together again, rekindling
memories if not repeating results. Kirby called it ``kind of
nostalgic.''

Castro: World financial collapse is coming

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Taking his crusade for an end to the
U.S. embargo against Cuba on the road, Fidel Castro warned of a
world financial collapse during a visit to his Caribbean neighbors.
	   ``We have no doubt the present world order is going to go into a
crisis,'' Castro told several hundred ordinary Jamaicans whom he
met before flying on to Barbados. ``There will have to be a new
world, a different world with a new culture, because we know that
culture cannot be the culture of the consumer society.''
	   Castro, on the third and last day of a triumphant Jamaican stop,
said that the 1994 Mexico currency crisis, last year's Asian
crisis, the economic turmoil in Russia and the prolonged Japanese
stagnation all pointed to a global failure of capitalism.
	   Castro then to flew Barbados, where he will honor the 73 victims
of the 1976 bombing of a Cuban jetliner.
	   Earlier, at a news conference, Castro and Jamaican Prime
Minister P.J. Patterson outlined a new role for the Non-Aligned
Movement of more than 100 developing nations, which has been
essentially without a cause since losing its role as a third voice
after the two superpowers during the Cold War.
	   ``We see it as a framework for dialogue and cooperation among
developing countries... an avenue for ensuring respect for
principles which offer protection to small and vulnerable states,''
Patterson said.
	   During the news conference, Castro lost his temper with a
journalist for Miami's Channel 23 who described the social chasm
between Cubans who have access to hard currency and those who do
not as ``dollar apartheid.''
	   ``You make assertions because you don't know what apartheid
is,'' he shouted. ``You're too white to know that!''
	   At the airport near Bridgetown he was to meet with Prime
Minister Owen Arthur, who plans to join his guest in leading a
procession at dawn Saturday to commemorate the 160th anniversary of
the emancipation of Barbadian slaves.
	   On Sunday Castro proceeds to his third and last stop, Grenada.
	   All three islands on Castro's unprecedented tour once shunned
the Communist leader but now are leading a campaign to soften the
U.S. position on Cuba _ a reflection of general bitterness about
U.S. economic policy in the region.
	   Castro has cast himself as a champion of the economically
vulnerable island nations of the Caribbean, charging that U.S.
policies have caused factories to leave the area, cost thousands of
jobs and threaten its limited trade.
	   Earlier, in Kingston, Castro stood in meditation at the
graveside of former Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley. Dressed
in a dark business suit, he laid a flower wreath dedicated ``to the
unforgettable friend.''
	   Outside the cemetery Friday, a few dozen people gathered
carrying homemade signs welcoming Castro. ``Love that man! Love
that man!'' said one of them, Elaine Green. ``The times are
changing _ when is the United States going to change?''
	   By contrast, little fanfare accompanied Castro's visit in
Barbados, as most ``Bajans'' focused on their Cropover carnival.
	   Several callers to local radio stations protested Castro's
participation in the Emancipation Day proceedings, saying full
freedom starts at home _ a reference to human rights conditions in
Cuba.

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey (AP) _ Forty-five years after two
lifeguards swam around the island on a bet, marathon swimmers from
around the world will make the 22-mile (35-kilometer) trip
Saturday.
	   It is no longer just a friendly dlrs 200 bet, like it was when
Ed Solitaire and Dutch Stetser dove off Steel Pier in August 1953
to see who could do it faster.
	   Twenty-three professional swimmers _ and one amateur _ will vie
for dlrs 30,000 in prize money in the grueling seven-hour event.
They include 16 men and seven women from 10 countries.
	   But the Atlantic City Ocean Marathon Swim, one of the most
difficult events of its kind, remains a cherished local tradition
for both participants and spectators.
	   ``It is a unique blend of the world's best marathon swimmers
mixing with some of the best ocean athletes we have,'' says Mayor
James Whelan, a former lifeguard who twice competed in the race and
is still involved in its organization.
	   After Stetser and Solitaire started it, the Around the Island
Swim _ as it was originally known _ attracted an international
field and was held annually for 11 years. It was discontinued in
1964 because of difficulty raising the money necessary to offer
prizes.
	   In 1978, Whelan swam around the island by himself to try to drum
up interest. It worked: Beginning in 1979, businesses and casinos
got into the swim, contributing money and other support.
	   Each year, they come from around the world, greasing their
bodies in Vaseline or oil and climbing into the water in the back
bay near Gardner's Basin for the start of the race.
	   Lifeguards from up and down the Jersey shore man surf boats _
two per boat _ and row alongside each swimmer to provide food,
drink, direction, support, information about who's ahead and how
many miles (kilometers) there are to go.
	   Every 20 minutes or so, the swimmer will roll over and
backstroke while his support team hands him or her a banana, bottle
of Gatorade or cookie.
	   ``It's a surreal experience,'' says Sid Cassidy, 42, a former
lifeguard who has competed five times. ``You definitely find a
different beam within yourself.''
	   When Cassidy swam it, he had his support team play Bruce
Springsteen tapes on a boom box in the boat to keep him motivated.
Other swimmers sing to themselves to kill the boredom.
	   ``You try to put your mind in a different state. You just try
and let go. For me it was music, getting into a rhythm. Some people
get into a trance-like meditation,'' he said.
	   Training for months in advance _ and year-round in some cases _
the swimmers are well prepared for the distance. It's the special
circumstances that can make the trip tricky. This year, it's
jellyfish. Ocean beaches have been plagued by them, and the
swimmers are worried.
	   ``They're the big enemies,'' said last year's winner, Christof
Wandratsch, 31, of Germany.
	   This year, competitors representing Argentina, Australia,
Bulgaria, Canada, the Czech Republic, Egypt, France, Germany, the
Netherlands and the United States will compete.

Controversial group tracks down child porn in Belgium
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Europe was shocked when Dutch police
raided an apartment in a quiet seaside town earlier this month and
discovered a trove of pornography on computer disks showing
middle-aged men having sex with children. Jan Boeykens wasn't
surprised.
	   Boeykens leads a group called Morkhoven that is waging its own
private war against child pornography and already had disks from
the apartment. These vigilantes are determined to put an end to a
business that has spread to the Internet, and their actions _
including a fight with police about handing over evidence _ have
earned them a mixed reputation.
	   Boeykens, a human rights campaigner who long has fought child
abuse and police brutality, says he has no faith in Belgian
authorities. He doesn't have much confidence in Dutch police
either. And like many vigilante groups, his has had occasional
brushes with the law.
	   Founded in 1988 in northern Belgium, Morkhoven caught the public
eye earlier this month when police in the Dutch town of Zandvoort
raided the apartment of convicted German pedophile Gerrie Ulrich,
49. Ulrich was shot to death in Pisa, Italy, in June, allegedly by
a rival gang member.
	   Morkhoven already had been on to Ulrich and had diskettes from
the Zandvoort apartment. Instead of taking its findings to police,
Morkhoven took them to Dutch television.
	   Police claimed Morkhoven people broke into the apartment.
Boeykens says the material was obtained from the Ulrich family.
	   On July 20, Belgian police arrested Morkhoven member Marcel
Vervloesem for refusal to hand over diskettes and files on the
child-sex ring. He eventually complied and was released.
	   ``I think some people in the justice system are involved,'' said
Boeykens, explaining why Morkhoven was reluctant to relinquish the
material. ``Some policemen are involved. They are not angels. And I
think some political people are involved.''
	   Belgian officialdom is similarly suspicious of Morkhoven. An
investigation of the group is under way, but State Prosecutor Marc
Sterkens refused to say whether charges have been filed.
	   Boeykens says the Netherlands case is part of a ring that
includes Amsterdam, Berlin, Antwerp, Rotterdam, Vienna and Prague.
He claims the ring is also connected to a case in the small Belgian
town of Tamise, where more than 300 cassettes depicting child sex
were found in the home of a pedophile.
	   The prosecutor says the cases are unrelated. Boeykens says the
prosecutor's office has had a file on the Tamise case since 1991
with specific names and places, but until recently did nothing.
	   Morkhoven got ahold of these names and began its own
investigation.
	   Morkhoven often has rubbed people the wrong way with its
anti-police tactics, and Vervloesem has had other scrapes with the
law over the years. The tarnished image makes the organization
difficult to judge.
	   Morkhoven is a close-knit group of 20 to 25 people, most of them
part-time volunteers from Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany with
the shared goal of exposing mistreatment of children. They began
fighting the use of isolation cells for children in a psychiatric
clinic and eventually moved on to other issues involving young
people.
	   ``From the beginning we've had a lot of problems with the
authorities,'' said Boeykens. ``When we started with actions
against the isolation cells, it was a taboo. They denied these
problems existed. It's the same now with the pornographic network.
They are criminalizing us.
	   ``We are not connected to a political party, we are not
subsidized. We are completely free.''
	   One sympathizer is Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel,
president of the European Union Council of Ministers, who thanked
Vervloesem for his ``courageous and exemplary action'' in helping
to expose the pornography ring in the Netherlands.
	   ``This case proves once more how urgently we have to act,
determinedly and together, on a European level, if our fight
against child abuse is to be successful,'' Schuessel said in a
letter to Vervloesem.
	   The publicity generated from the Netherlands case has shed light
on the previously little-known organization, increasing its support
and funding. But there are no plans to increase its size.
	   ``It's best to work small,'' says Boeykens. ``We have been
infiltrated in the past. And I think our telephone conversations
are monitored.''

Duval, Morgan lead field in Utah Showdown; Bench bats a 78
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG BEACHAM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ Bob Duval plays his best golf when his
son is in the gallery. Of course, PGA pro David Duval usually has
other commitments.
	   David was able to make it to the Utah Showdown this week, and
his father responded with a 6-under-par 66. He tied Gil Morgan for
the lead after the first day of the 54-hole tournament at Park
Meadows Country Club.
	   ``I'm going to see if he wants to quit his tour and follow me
around,'' Bob Duval joked. He recorded his first top-10 finish on
the Senior PGA Tour in the Showdown last year _ again with his son
in the gallery. ``I just play well when he's here and we're
together.''
	   Morgan and Duval were a dozen strokes better than Johnny Bench,
who carded a 78 in his debut on the senior tour. The baseball Hall
of Famer received a sponsor's exemption into the Showdown, and he
stumbled with two double bogeys on the back nine of an otherwise
solid round.
	   ``I'm pleased with the way I played,'' Bench said. ``I'm a
rookie just trying to do the best I can. I wasn't intimidated, but
it was definitely a different experience.''
	   Bob Duval, who never played on the PGA Tour, birdied three of
the last four holes on the day, but it was a looping 50-foot
(15-meter) eagle putt on the eighth hole that kick-started his
round.
	   ``That's one of those lucky putts that makes you think maybe
it's your day,'' Duval said.
	   Morgan didn't decide to enter the Showdown until earlier this
week. It's looking like a good decision. Morgan, who has won four
times on the Senior PGA Tour this year, roared into the clubhouse
with four straight birdies.
	   ``It was a last-minute decision to come here,'' Morgan said.
``But several players told me it was a great course and a great
event, so I thought I'd give it a shot.''
	   Morgan, No. 2 on the tour's money list behind no-show Hale
Irwin, played a steady round with a fantastic finish. After two
birdies and 12 pars on the first 14 holes, he birdied the last four
holes and finished with a twisting 30-foot (9-meter) putt on the
18th.
	   Morgan hasn't played in Utah since 1984, but he entered after
last week's U.S. Senior Open to boost a lackluster field in a
tournament that could be knocked off the tour schedule next year
because of sponsorship troubles.
	   ``The tournament was needing some help,'' said Morgan, who leads
the senior tour in the all-around rankings. ``I came in here not
knowing what to expect. Hopefully, I'm learning as I go forward.''
	   Morgan and Duval finished the day two strokes ahead of Jerry
McGee and John Jacobs. McGee is still looking for his first senior
victory.
	   Jacobs, the senior tour's longest driver, took advantage of Park
Meadows' wet fairways and supple greens. He's hunting for his
second victory of the year after taking his first in the Nationwide
Championship in early June.
	   ``For a while it looked like I was going to (score) 72 and be
very depressed, but now it's a 68 and I'm happy,'' Jacobs said.
``Hopefully the course favors a guy that hits like me.''
	   Dave Stockton, who has won the Showdown twice and finished
second twice in the last five years, carded a 2-under-par 70 to tie
him with Isao Aoki and 11 others.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The birthplace of the Olympics is building
a basketball tradition.
	   Buoyed by boisterous crowds, the host of the Basketball World
Championship has emerged as a medals contender with three straight
victories.
	   ``We haven't had our best game yet, but we played well enough to
win all three,'' coach Panagiotis Yannakis said after Greece's
68-57 win over Senegal on Friday night put the team into the
tournament's second round as the winner of Group A.
	   In a performance typical of the team's balance, three players _
Dimitri Papanikolaou, Giorgios Sigalis and Angelos Koronios _
shared scoring honors with 11 points apiece.
	   Fragiskos Alvertis, a 2.06-meter (6-foot-10) forward, added 10.
He led Greece to its earlier wins over Italy and Canada, averaging
19.5 points per game.
	   After Saturday's off-day, play resumes Sunday with the
round-robin second round, which takes the top 12 teams so far and
puts them in two brackets.
	   One group's games Sunday are Greece vs. Puerto Rico, Russia vs.
Italy, and Yugoslavia vs. Canada. The other group has the United
States vs. Argentina, Lithuania vs. Australia and Spain vs. Brazil.
	   Greece burst onto the international basketball scene by taking
the 1987 European title. Since then, the team has finished fourth
at the 1994 world championship and fifth at the Atlanta Olympics.
Pro teams from the Greek League have won two of the last three
European club titles.
	   But the lack of a long-standing history of success has some fans
cautious.
	   ``I think that it will be difficult to win the gold medal here
because we will have to beat good teams like maybe the U.S.,
Lithuania or Yugoslavia,'' said Costas Moschomakis, 16, his hair
painted blue and his voice hoarse from cheering. ``We don't know if
we will make it.''
	   It will be tough, if history is any indication.
	   The last eight world titles have been divvied up by the United
States, Yugoslavia and the old Soviet Union. Greece will likely
have to beat Yugoslavia or Russia to reach the quarterfinals here.
	   Moschomakis was part of the near-sellout crowd that watched the
win over Senegal at the Peace and Friendship arena. Greece has been
playing to packed houses this week while crowds in the hundreds
have watched other games.
	   In addition to the hosts, Yugoslavia, Lithuania and Spain all
reached the next stage with 3-0 records. The United States, without
its Dream Team because of the NBA labor dispute, is 2-1 heading
into the second round.

Accused money launderer may try to finger top Mexican officials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A suspect held in the United States has
accused top Mexican military and government officials of
involvement in money laundering, Mexican prosecutors said Friday as
they announced a request to interview the man.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo told prosecutors to ask U.S.
authorities for access to Victor Alcala Navarro, a suspect caught
in a U.S. money laundering sting operation in May.
	   ``This request is motivated by court transcripts ... that refer
in a general and imprecise way to the involvement of high-ranking
army and Mexican government authorities in attempts to launder
money,'' the Attorney General's Office said in a a press statement.
	   ``This corresponds to behavior frequently used by drug
traffickers and money launderers ... bragging about relationships
they do not have,'' the statement continued.
	   Prosecutors pledged to use the requested interview to
``investigate the truth'' about such accusations, but said ``the
underlying motive (of the accusations) is to ... plant suspicions
and mistrust between authorities of both countries.''
	   U.S. anti-drug officials were caught by surprise in February
1997 when Mexico's newly-appointed drug czar was arrested on
charges that he receiving money from Mexico's top cocaine smuggler.
	   Alcala Navarro, whom prosecutors called ``a known drug
trafficker and money launderer for the Alvaro Tostado and Amado
Carrillo Fuentes'' drug cartels, was indicted in Los Angeles May 18
on charges of conspiracy and money laundering.
	   The U.S. sting, code named ``Operation Casablanca,'' resulted in
the seizure of dlrs 110 million and indictments against three
Mexican banks in the United States.
	   Prosecutors also announced Friday that they had caught two more
money laundering suspects, using information gathered by U.S.
undercover agents during the Casablanca operation.
	   Under questioning, both men admitted that they had made up
stories about having high-level contacts in the federal government,
in order to convince potential associates of their ability to
launder money, according to the statement.
	   The Mexican government has expressed anger that U.S. agents
carried out the sting without informing Mexican officials, and has
indicated that it wants to prosecute the agents and to seek their
extradition to face criminal charges.

IMF official discusses Russian loan package in Moscow

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A senior International Monetary Fund official is
pressuring Russia to enact economic reforms in exchange for a dlrs
22.6 billion international bailout even as the IMF denies that it
is considering further loans to the country.
	   Both the ruble and the stock market closed slightly lower
Friday, reflecting continued uncertainty about the government's
ability to address fundamental problems in the economy.
	   Stanley Fischer, the IMF's first deputy managing director, held
talks Friday with Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko in Moscow.
Fischer was also scheduled to meet with Kiriyenko's finance
minister and the chairman of the Central Bank about cutting
spending and improving tax collection.
	   Fischer and Kiriyenko agreed the Russian government's austerity
program should lead to stability, the government's press service
said.
	   Fischer's visit appeared to be hastily arranged, coming less
than three weeks after the IMF approved its portion of the bailout.
Yet IMF officials denied the visit signaled any major problems.
	   ``He is on a working visit to assess together with the Russians
whether everything that needs to be done to ensure implementation
of the program is indeed being done,'' said Martin Gilman, head of
the IMF's Moscow office.
	   The Communist-dominated parliament opposes many economic
reforms, and the government has been forced to implement some by
decree. International lenders are keeping pressure on the
government to follow through on its promises, which often have
remained unfulfilled.
	   Fischer also was scheduled to meet Anatoly Chubais, the
government's envoy to international lending institutions.
	   The IMF deputy was expected to meet Saturday with the aggressive
new chairman of the State Taxation Service, Boris Fyodorov, the
Interfax news agency said. Poor tax collection is a major problem
for the Russian economy.
	   Fyodorov said Friday the government had collected dlrs 80.6
million more in July taxes than the dlrs 1.8 billion it collected
in June. It expects to collect dlrs 1.9 billion in August, he said.
	   The government also said the natural gas monopoly Gazprom,
Russia's largest company and one of its biggest tax-dodgers, had
paid its July tax bill of dlrs 40 million.

The unexpected is part of the jungle adventure

<TEXT>
	   IRANDUBA, Brazil (AP) _ The Acajatuba Jungle Lodge had no phone,
TV or hot water. The electricity came on only after dark. Swimming
was discouraged because of flesh-eating piranhas.
	   The Krabbes loved it.
	   ``Well, we expected to find the rain forest, and we found it,''
said Henning Krabbe, a postal worker from Nykobing, Denmark.
	   ``And it is more beautiful than I could have imagined,'' added
his wife, Jane.
	   Not all guests are so satisfied. Eco-tourism in the Amazon
jungle is so new that quality varies widely. Service is
hit-or-miss, and some visitors feel hoteliers take ``rustic'' too
far.
	   Still, for many eco-tourists, the unexpected is simply part of
the adventure.
	   It starts on the bustling docks of Manaus, the Amazon's biggest
city. Hoarse shouts in Portuguese direct the chaotic traffic below,
where dugout canoes jostle among banana barges, an oceangoing
freighter from Singapore and the white wooden ``recreios,'' the
passenger boats that serve as regional buses.
	   The equatorial sun is already burning through the early morning
haze when the Wladynha, a boxy, double-decked craft, nuzzles up to
the pier to pick up guests for the jungle lodge.
	   The boat wheels and heads up the Rio Negro, named after its
black, naturally acidic waters. The two passengers on this trip
stretch out in pool chairs on the upper deck, which doubles as the
roof. The sun pours down _ and up, reflecting off the river.
Sunscreen is a survival item.
	   Leaving the city behind, the boat chugs past beaches of
glittering white sand. Egrets perch on the gray skeleton of an
abandoned fishing shack. Tree trunks and floating islands of grass
and reeds drift past: night sailing here is not for the timid.
	   Rising above the forest canopy on the left bank is the Ariau
Amazon Tower, the Ritz of jungle resorts. A suite here can cost
more than 700 reals (dlrs 600) a night, and special features
include a helipad, theater, convention rooms and treetop walkways
100 feet (30 meters) above the ground. Actor Kevin Costner and
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl stayed here, but most tourists prefer
a place with fewer frills.
	   Nearly four hours after setting out, the boat veers left into
the Rio Acajatuba. Around another bend, almost hidden in the
forest, is the thatch-roofed Acajatuba Jungle Lodge.
	   The boat ties up at a catwalk that leads up to an open-air
lobby, where manager Gustavo Santos waits with a complimentary
glass of jenipapo liqueur, made from a local fruit. Then he shows
guests to their rooms, in wooden bungalows along an elevated
walkway.
	   The accommodations are spotless but Spartan: bed, table, sink,
flush toilet, for about 100 reals (dlrs 90) a night per person,
including meals. Light at night is powered by a 12-volt battery,
but no one came here to spend time indoors.
	   The guests are a mix of 20-somethings and older couples. All are
foreigners, mostly from Europe. They are grouped by language and
assigned a local guide who speaks English, German, French and
Spanish.
	   Activities are decided by consensus. Jungle walks are an early
morning favorite, especially for bird fanciers. Visitors try to
photograph a giant samauma (pronounced sah-mah-OO-mah) tree, but
it's so huge no lens can capture it all.
	   Groups head off to explore jungle creeks or to visit the nearby
Anavilhanas, the world's largest river archipelago. Others fish for
piranha.
	   Lunch is served buffet-style in the lobby, while workers pound
away on a new restaurant next door. The main dish, not
surprisingly, is fresh fish _ tucunare and jaraque, bony but
delicious.
	   In a box by the reception desk is another visitor, a 10-foot
(3-meter) boa constrictor found by the grounds crew that morning.
Santos will release it far away. He says the hotel once tried
keeping a boa as a pet ``but it kept eating the parrots.''
	   In the afternoon, it's off to visit a typical riverside village
of neat wooden cabins, a church and soccer field. A diesel
generator and satellite dish at the general store provide a link
with the outside world.
	   On the way out, there's a mandatory visit to the crafts store.
Most items are fake Indian beads and feathers, shoddily made.
Visitors usually feel obliged to buy something.
	   After dinner, the program is alligator spotting. As the dugout
glides silently under the black sky, the guide flashes a lantern on
the water where dozens of coal-red eyes gleam in the darkness. The
canoe suddenly seems unstable, and passengers reach instinctively
for the gunwales.
	   Safely back on shore, it's time to turn in. Guests head for
their rooms, guided by torches on the handrail, and fall sleep to
the songs and screeches of the jungle just beyond the screen.

Tours are less than ecologically correct

	   MANAUS, Brazil (AP) _ For John Coelho, eco-tourism means donning
a headdress of dyed chicken feathers, slinging an abused-looking
anaconda over his shoulders and charging tourists to have their
picture taken with him.
	   But, hey, it beats whacking weeds with a hoe for a living.
	   Eco-tourism is a family business for the Coelhos. John's father
runs the restaurant where boatloads of tourists eat lunch after
their jungle walk. The rest of the family sells imitation Indian
artifacts.
	   ``If we have a lot of people, I make good money, but it hasn't
been that way for a while,'' says John, who earns between 10 reals
(dlrs 9) and 20 reals (dlrs 18) a day.
	   That's not too bad in a country where the minimum wage is about
30 reals (dlrs 25) a week. But it's a far cry from the bonanza that
eco-tourism seemed to promise a few years ago.
	   Encouraged by Latin American success stories, especially in
Costa Rica, Brazil belatedly discovered eco-tourism after the 1992
Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.
	   With the world's largest wilderness, Brazil seemed the perfect
place to attract eco-tourists. Supporters predicted it would bring
wealth to the region and jobs to the poor. Best of all, it would
preserve the Amazon's natural riches.
	   Now, Brazilians are finding that eco-tourism produces fewer jobs
than expected, and that the jobs, like John's, are often less than
glamorous.
	   ``We see now that eco-tourism is just one of the solutions, not
the only solution, to developing the Amazon,'' says Jayth Chaves
Filho, director of tourist development for the Amazonas state
tourism board.
	   Another problem is the Amazon's sheer size and distance from
traditional tourist gateways, thousands of miles (kilometers) away
in southern Brazil. And, domestic air fares aren't cheap.
	   ``It's beautiful, but too expensive. It's cheaper to fly to
Miami than it is to come here,'' says Maria Halford, who paid just
over 1,100 reals (dlrs 1,000) for a round-trip plane ticket from
Rio de Janeiro.
	   Eco-tourism became even more expensive with a 1994
anti-inflation plan that has kept the real, the local currency,
overvalued. The dollar just doesn't go very far in Brazil.
	   A night at a jungle lodge can cost as much as 200 reals (dlrs
170), or about three times what it might cost in Ecuador or Peru.
The rudimentary accommodations fuel suspicions that the hotels are
overcharging.
	   ``It was all very charming, but it could have been more
comfortable,'' complains Tanya Price, an Englishwoman living in New
York. ``To get to the bathroom we had to take a boat or swim to an
outhouse on the other side of the river.''
	   Since 1995, the number of tourists to Manaus has dropped 40
percent.
	   ``A few years ago, we had 40 or 50 people on this boat every day
of the week. Now we don't leave port but two or three times a week
because there aren't enough people,'' says tour guide Waldemiro
Ferreira as his riverboat leaves port with nine people aboard, less
than one-tenth of its capacity.
	   The quality of the tours can leave much to be desired.
	   ``They walked us through some woods, showed us some Vitoria
Regis lilies. We didn't even see any animals,'' says Giorgio Boni
of Genoa, Italy. ``I was hoping for a little more.''
	   Tours often are less than ecologically correct.
	   ``A lot of people are raising the flag of eco-tourism just for
the sake of marketing,'' Chaves concedes. ``They open a jungle
lodge, but they use a diesel generator that pollutes the air, the
sewage runs untreated into the river and garbage disposal is
another problem.''
	   Also, to make a profit, tour operators must bring more tourists
into unspoiled areas than is ecologically sound.
	   Furthermore, profits don't necessarily trickle down to the
community. Even the guide jobs, a natural for the locals, often go
to foreigners who can speak the same language as the tourists.
	   In New Guinea, some tribes became so angry at the lack of money
going to the communities that they burned down some jungle lodges.
	   It's not that bad in the Amazon. But Bret Whitney, who runs
bird-watching tours in several countries _ including Brazil _ says,
``the reality is that after the lodges are built, most of the jobs
dry up.''

	    &UR; IF YOU GO ...
	   TRAVEL: The starting point for most eco-tourism in Brazil is
Manaus, the capital of Amazonas state and the largest city in the
region. About halfway between Miami and Rio de Janeiro, Manaus is
best reached by air. The alternative is a five-day boat trip from
Belem in the neighboring Para state, which is 51 hours by bus from
Rio de Janeiro.
	   Varig has a few direct flights to Manaus from abroad and will
add a stopover in Manaus to a Rio de Janeiro or Sao Paulo ticket
for not much more than the standard fare, about dlrs 1,200 from New
York.
	   The best time to go is when it is summer in the Northern
Hemisphere, or winter in Brazil. Reservations should not be a
problem, unless your plane passes through Rio where flights fill up
in February and March as tourists head for Carnival.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   CLIMATE: The rainy season is from January to June, but because
the Amazon is close to the equator, the temperature does not vary
much throughout the year. The average temperature is 27 C (80 F),
but a visitor should prepared for high humidity and temperatures as
high as 40 C (104 F).
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LODGING: In Manaus, the top-of-the-line hotel is the Tropical _
(55-92) 238-5757 _ where rooms run about 200 reals (dlrs 170) a
night. It is a little off the beaten path. In the center, there are
better bargains; rooms range from about 20 reals (dlrs 18) a night
for basic accommodations to about 80 reals (dlrs 70) a night for
something in mid-range, such as the Hotel Nacional, (55-92)
233-7533.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   JUNGLE LODGES: The most famous jungle lodge is the Ariau Jungle
Tower. There you can stay in an air-conditioned tree house in the
middle of the jungle, just three hours out of Manaus by boat.
Reservations can be made through Rio Amazonas Turismo, (55-92)
234-7308. Nightly rates start at about 200 reals (dlrs 170).
Somewhat more reasonable options are the Acajatuba Jungle and
Janaucaca Jungle lodges. Reservations can be made through Tropical
Tours at (55-92) 238-5757.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   RESTAURANTS: Amazon River fish is the local specialty. Fish
dishes such as calderada de tambaqui and pirarucu ribs are very
tasty. In the jungle there is little choice but to eat the food the
tour operator provides. In Manaus, the best fish can be found at
Chapeu de Palha, Rua Fortaleza 619 and Restaurante Panorama, Rua
Recife 900. Mostly the food is under 20 reals (dlrs 18), and one
dish will easily serve two.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   TRANSPORTATION: Lodges provide transportation to and from
Manaus. River boats travel up and down the Rio Negro for days in
either direction. Prices vary and passages can be booked at the
floating port.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   PEOPLE: Real Indians are hard to find. Most of the locals are
caboclos, people of mixed Indian blood. Many of the local
handicrafts are imitations made by the caboclo. For authentic
Indian goods the best bet is the FUNAI store, run by the Federal
Indian Bureau in Manaus.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   CURRENCY: The Brazilian real, currently trading at about 1.15
reals to the dollar.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   INFORMATION: Despite promises of an improved tourism program,
tourist information is hard to obtain and maps rarer still. The
Amazonas Tourism Board, Emamtur, may provide some assistance at
(55-92) 243-5983.

Dude ranches are putting a 1990s spin on the Old West

<TEXT>
	   HARRISON, Idaho (AP) _ Dude ranches are still doing business at
a gallop after more than a century, but some are putting a very
1990s spin on the Old West.
	   Traditional operations _ working ranches where guests sweat and
toil through their vacation _ are still around. But now there's a
new version _ part resort, part riding school and part
environmental retreat.
	   Take Hidden Creek Ranch, now in its sixth year of operation near
this northern Idaho town.
	   In addition to trail rides, nature hikes and a week's end rodeo
for the more adventurous, it offers yoga and meditation classes, a
pipe and sweat lodge ceremony, and a medicine trail hike, where
guests learn the edible and medicinal properties of native plants.
	   ``You have to slow down from your hectic pace and find peace
within yourself,'' says Iris Behr, who operates the ranch with her
husband, John Muir, a descendant of the 19th-century naturalist and
Sierra Club founder of the same name.
	   ``We always wanted to go to a dude ranch,'' says Peter Weertman,
who spent a recent week at the ranch with his wife and two
children.
	   ``Last year, we had a family reunion here. We all had such a
great time. The kids liked it better than Disneyland.''
	   Weertman's 11-year-old daughter, Renee, confirms that.
	   ``There's a lot of stuff you can do here that you can't do at
Disneyland,'' she says. ``I really like riding horses, but you also
get to sleep in tepees, do archery and go swimming.''
	   The kids put in busy days and get together with the adults at
dinnertime.
	   ``It's a very stress-free vacation,'' says Renee's mother,
Michelle Weertman. ``The kids have a lot of freedom and it's very
safe and relaxing.''
	   Some ranches are near national parks and offer forest trail
rides with naturalists. Others get wildlife rescuers to bring in
native animals such as eagles, hawks and owls, allowing guests a
close-up look.
	   At Hidden Creek Ranch, ``We lead guests to fall in love with
nature and want to protect it,'' Behr says.
	   That philosophy extends to the ranch's 100 horses.
	   ``We want the guests to have fun and ride as much as they want,
but we always think of the horses first,'' says head wrangler
Morton Barnes.
	   ``It's a Native American philosophy, a commitment to living in
harmony with nature,'' Behr says.
	   The ranch also is committed to preserving the environment, which
means using recycled, reusable and organic products wherever
possible. Behr and Muir say they want to show guests _ the ranch
can accommodate 45 people at a time _ how easy it is to recycle and
live with fewer disposable products.
	   ``We let them try it out. It's not a hard sell,'' Muir says.
	   Honeymooners Joe and Dawn Simonetti of Cleveland, Ohio, felt a
bit out of step with the Indian philosophy, but tried the sweat
lodge.
	   ``It was a different kind of experience,'' Joe Simonetti says.
	   ``We'll definitely come back,'' adds Dawn Simonetti. ``I've
always appreciated nature and this just makes you want to
appreciate it more.''
	   Dude ranches have been around since the 1880s, but there's been
a resurgence since the late 1980s _ in part due to Hollywood and
movies such as ``The Horse Whisperer'' and ``City Slickers,'' says
Jim Futterer, executive director of The Dude Ranchers' Association,
based in LaPorte, Colorado.
	   Between 300 and 400 guest ranches operate in the western United
States, Futterer says. While it's difficult to know exactly how
many new ranches have opened recently, he says membership in the
68-year-old association has doubled _ from 50 to more than 100 _ in
the past 10 years.
	   The cost of a one-week stay at a dude ranch ranges from about
dlrs 700 a person for a smaller, out-of-the-way facility that has
some horses but few or no planned activities, to dlrs 4,000 for
four-star accommodations. Hidden Creek Ranch charges about dlrs
1,500 for adults, with discounts for children.
	   ``It was in my childhood dreams to ride Western in a place like
this,'' says Billy Thomson, an experienced horsewoman from
Edinburgh, Scotland, who recently spent two weeks at Hidden Valley
Ranch with her husband, Sandy, and their 7-year-old son, David.
	   ``I think we've found something really special,'' Mrs. Thomson
adds, her eyes following the flight of an osprey soaring over the
ranch's 570 acres (230-hectares) of pine-studded hills and valleys
near Lake Coeur d'Alene.
	   ``It's really, really expensive, but it's been the holiday of a
lifetime.''

Renovating museums and historic sites

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A hundred years after declaring
independence from Spain, the Philippines is putting its history on
display.
	   The government is spending at least 3.8 billion pesos (dlrs 92
million) on centennial celebrations this year. A third of that
money was used to renovate 16 historic shrines _ some buried in
debris _ and to construct about 100 new historical markers and
monuments along the ``freedom trail'' where Filipinos put up
resistance against Spain.
	   The islands have a lively history interwoven with influences
from Southeast Asia, Spain, China, the United States and Japan. But
like many Philippine tourist attractions, the country's museums
have been hard to find and often lacking in facilities.
	   Manila's national museum, for example, was so short on space
that most of its artifacts were displayed in the hallways of a
building it shared with the Philippine Senate.
	   But thanks to the centennial, tourists and lovers ofculture and
history will soon have a much more rewarding time.
	   The government, helped by private companies, is building three
museums and renovating many others.
	   For historians, the new facilities are likely to be the
centennial celebration's most important legacy.
	   Samuel Tan, chairman of the National Historical Institute, says
he is elated by all of the atttention after years of struggling
with too little money for the institute to properly maintain the
country's monuments.
	   The Philippines declared independence from 333 years of Spanish
colonial rule on June 12, 1898. But before it could gain its
independence it was acquired by the United States, which defeated
Spain in the 1898 Spanish-American War.
	   It received independence from the United States in 1946.
	   The restoration efforts are aimed in part at popularizing
history among Filipinos, who are often derided for knowing too
little about their past.
	   Three old buildings near Manila's historic Intramuros district _
the walled city where the Spanish elite once lived _ are being
transformed into people-friendly museums.
	   The Museum of the Filipino People opened in June with exhibits
including 2,000-year-old burial jars and a prominent collection of
artifacts from a sunken 16th-century Spanish galleon.
	   The museum also offers hands-on activities, such as archaeology
lessons in a sandbox containing buried ancient pottery, and
storytelling about the country's 2,000-year tradition of
boat-building.
	   An art museum is to open in 2001, followed by a natural science
museum two years later.

Lancaster, Price lead St. Jude after two rounds

<TEXT>
	   MEMPHIS, Tennessee (AP) _ Neal Lancaster shot a 6-under-par 65
Friday to catch Nick Price at 10-under for a share of the
second-day lead in the St. Jude Classic.
	   Price backed up his opening-round 65 with a 67, while Lancaster
played the front nine in 5-under par, including three straight
birdies.
	   The big mover of the round was Glen Day, who eagled both par-5s
on the front side and shot a 64, the low round of the tournament.
Day was alone in third at 9-under, a stroke behind the leaders.
	   Paul Azinger began the day sharing the lead with Price and Russ
Cochran. Azinger shot a 69 on Friday, leaving him at 8-under par
with Scott Hoch, who shot 68.
	   Cochran shot a 70 and was tied with Bob Estes, who shot 67, and
Donnie Hammond, who had a 69, at 7-under.
	   Day became the 13th player to card two eagles in one round on
the PGA Tour this year. He said a chip from 30 yards (27 meters)
short of the green on the 525-yard (477-meter) No. 3 ``just
happened to go in.''
	   Two holes later, on the 527-yard (480-meter) No. 5, he hit a
2-iron approach from 250 yards (228 meters) ``and just got lucky.''
	   Day also had five birdies to offset two bogeys on the 7,006-yard
(6,375-meter) TPC at Southwind course.
	   Price, the 1993 St. Jude champion, played another steady round
highlighted by an eagle on No. 16, his second there in two days.
	   ``I think I doubled my eagle score for the year in two days,''
Price said. ``Making back-to-back eagles is in the lap of the gods.
That's just a lot of luck.''
	   It was the 11th consecutive round of par or better in the
FedEx-sponsored St. Jude for Price, who said his game is returning
to the form that made him the world's preeminent player in 1994,
when he won six tournaments.
	   ``It's just a question of how hot the putter gets,'' he said.
``Tee to green, my game is better than it was through that period
of '91 through '94. The only thing lacking right now is confidence.
If I can get a win under my belt, I think the dam wall will break
and I'll win a few more.''
	   Lancaster bogeyed two of the first four holes and was 1-under
after playing the back nine to start. He caught fire on the front
nine with birdies at Nos. 1, 3, 4, 5 and 9.
	   He got a break on No. 3 when he pulled his short approach shot
30 feet (9 meters) past the hole, then made the putt almost by
accident.
	   ``I was lagging and it went in,'' he said. ``It was
unbelievable. I could have stood there and hit 25 balls and never
made one, no way.''
	   After that, he said, all the putts looked like gimmes.

Dinosaur design team brings back history in Oklahoma
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NORMAN, Oklahoma (AP) _ This is one big move.
	   Dinosaur designers at the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural
History have worked for three years readying prehistoric creatures
for a December move into the museum's Ancient Life Gallery.
	   The new dlrs 44 million facility to replace the University of
Oklahoma's old natural history museum is scheduled to open in late
1999, with some five million artifacts on display.
	   Fossil preparators and volunteers have been busy cleaning and
mounting the remains of dozens of exhibits, including an
85-million-year-old marine turtle that once swam in a shallow ocean
that stretched across eastern Oklahoma and a 9-million-year-old
elephant-like creature known as a Gomphotherium.
	   The dinosaur builders are working out of an old gym at the
University of Oklahoma, where the unfinished skull of a
75-million-year-old Pentasaratops dominates a section of the
building. The skull, which is considered the largest of any land
vertebrate, has five distinct horns and is 10 feet (3 meters) tall
from its nose to the top of its frill.

 &UR; A book lover's guide to literary landmarks in Great Britain
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Bookworms should get a gander at a literary map
being offered free by the British Tourist Authority.
	   In full color on heavy paper, the number-coded site guide covers
literary England, Scotland and Wales, listing authors from A to W,
Jane Austen to William Wordsworth.
	   It will guide you, for example, to Hill Top Farm in the Lake
District, where Beatrix Potter wrote ``Peter Rabbit,'' or to Rye on
the south coast of Kent where Henry James lived in his later years.
It suggests you wear stout walking shoes if you plan to head for
the North Yorkshire moors of the Bronte sisters, Charlotte, Emily
and Anne.

 &UR; Zagat survey of French diners upsets old culinary order
	   PARIS (AP) _ The French are indignant once again over an
incursion into their culture _ ordinary diners rating food!
	   Americans, in the form of the Zagat Survey, called for everyone
to vote, and the French voted with their forks.
	   Zagat's, which already rates restaurants in New York and London
by surveying eaters, has upset the old culinary order with a newly
published guide that reviews 825 Paris restaurants. More than 1,700
diners participated, 96 percent of them French.
	   One French critic called it a scandal and sniffed: ``It's the
very negation of a guidebook _ it's done by polls.''
	   Zagat's responded in a news release that French diners are much
tougher critics than New Yorkers, but at French prices they should
be. Of the 20 most expensive restaurants reviewed in Paris, the
average cost was dlrs 121.99, compared to dlrs 69.33 in New York.

 &UR; Horsey set returning to Saratoga for 130th thoroughbred meeting
	   SARATOGA, New York (AP) _ August marks the 130th thoroughbred
meeting in this old town of mineral springs and pre-Revolutionary
memories, where the horsey set has come for more than a century to
open their big houses and beat the heat.
	   But this year's calendar of events emphasizes the ordinary with
its racetrack giveaways of T-shirts and umbrellas.
	   The oldest track in the nation is offering baseball caps to paid
entrants on Aug. 2, T-shirts on Aug. 9, an umbrella on Aug. 16, and
a six-pack cooler bag on Aug. 23. NFL (National Football League)
alumni greats will be on hand for festivities on Aug. 9, and a

 &UR; Trolley makes comeback on streets of San Francisco
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ They're the streetcars named desirable _
again.
	   While tourists and residents alike ooh and ahh over the city's
famous cable cars, the clickety-clack of a rival has proven popular
on the streets of San Francisco.
	   Vintage trolleys _ once close to extinction _ are a
transportation workhorse slowly making a comeback here and around
the nation.
	   Trolleys are reappearing in cities such as Portland, Oregon,
Dallas, Memphis, Tennessee, and Charlotte, North Carolina. In some
cases, the trains have been credited for helping to revive moribund
neighborhoods.
	   Electric trolleys were introduced in the late 1800s and signaled
a new mobility for working-class people formerly confined to their
neighborhoods. By 1917, there were nearly 45,000 miles (72,400
kilometers) of tracks nationwide.
	   San Francisco's 17 cars were designed in the 1930s at the
request of presidents of electric car companies in the United
States and Canada who wanted standardized, improved, streamlined
street cars.
	   That's what they got _ cars that were among the sturdiest and
most reliable transit vehicles ever made.
	   ``They were built in an era when things were designed to last,''
said Mike Simonds, the shop foreman at the Seashore Trolley Museum
in Kennebunkport, Maine. ``Back then they didn't even know how to
spell `planned obsolescence.'''
	   Then, with the advent of gasoline-powered buses and underground
subways, most cities gradually dropped trolleys. They still operate
in Boston, Newark, New Jersey, and Toronto.
	   But only in New Orleans and San Francisco are the trolleys _
usually called streetcars by city natives _ a major transportation
force.

Japan reacts with skepticism at Obuchi's first steps as premier
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recaps previous. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's promises of swift
action to pull the economy out of recession and heal the ailing
banking system were greeted with mixed reviews Saturday in the
Japanese media.
	   Commentators agreed that the tax cuts and public works spending
that Obuchi pledged Friday in his first news conference as premier
were necessary steps toward economic recovery.
	   But some wondered if the prime minister's self-styled ``economic
recovery Cabinet'' was up to the task of implementing those
policies effectively.
	   The respected Nihon Keizai financial daily lamented ``the lack
of capable people and lack of determination among today's
politicians.''
	   Obuchi said Friday he would promptly implement 6 trillion yen
(dlrs 42 billion) in tax cuts, 10 trillion yen (dlrs 70 billion) in
extra public works spending and up to a 20 percent cut in the
bureaucracy over five years.
	   ``I will definitely carry out these promises,'' Obuchi said.
	   But many criticized Obuchi's vagueness concerning other pressing
issues facing the economy.
	   ``These measures miss the mark,'' the mass-circulation Mainichi
Shimbun said in an editorial. ``The top priority is to pump life
back into the Japanese banking system.''
	   Japan's banks are struggling under a mountain of bad loans
incurred through the long slump in the nation's real estate market.
That has raised fears that many banks may fail and has triggered a
credit crunch that is starving Japanese companies of capital.
	   The exact size of the bad loan problem is still unclear. While
the government estimates that problem loans total 76 trillion yen
(dlrs 535 billion), some estimates say the number may be twice
that.
	   Obuchi repeated his previous pledges to address instability in
the banking system, but he gave no details about what he will do.
	   Friday's press conference was accompanied by more grim news
about the Japanese economy. The government announced that Japan's
unemployment rate surged to 4.3 percent in June, up from two
consecutive months at 4.1 percent.
	   The June figure is the highest since the government began its
current system of compiling unemployment data in 1953.
	   ``The ruling Liberal Democratic Party and Prime Minister Obuchi
lack a sense of crisis,'' the mass-circulation Yomiuri Shimbun said
in an editorial Saturday.
	   Obuchi is considered by many critics to be too beholden to the
special interest politics that dominate the Liberal Democratic
Party to take the bold, innovative steps.
	   He tried to reverse that image this week by naming former Prime
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa to take the finance minister's job.
Miyazawa, 78, is respected by many as an economics expert and is an
architect of the government's plan to fix its debt-laden banking
system.
	   Miyazawa on Friday pledged to open up the long-protected
industry to the sort of competition that experts say is necessary
to weed out the weaker companies.
	   ``It will be inevitable for unhealthy banks to close,'' Miyazawa
told state-run NHK television Friday.

Dead dogs, foxes apparently contaminated Sydney's water
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Its main water system infested with
parasites, the city that will host the 2000 Olympics is having a
tough time facing the international community. Even visiting U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has been warned: ``Don't
drink the water.''
	   The parasites giardia and cryptosporidium were found throughout
the system Wednesday and Thursday, and authorities admitted failing
consumers by not issuing early warnings to all residents. Prime
Minister John Howard labeled the health scare an international
embarrassment.
	   ``Of course it's embarrassing,'' Howard told a radio station
Friday. ``It's one of those unexpected things and everybody here's
hoping it will be fixed up as soon as possible.''
	   Albright and U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, in Australia
for annual consultations with their counterparts, arrived at the
Intercontinental Hotel on Thursday to be greeted by bellhops with a
friendly reminder not to drink the water.
	   Millions of residents resorted Friday to boiled or bottled water
and authorities tried to determine whether dead dogs and foxes were
the sources of the contamination.
	   Supermarkets reported panic-buying of bottled water and vendors
sold small bottles of water to drivers at stoplights. Millions of
people had to boil water to make it safe to drink.
	   A hotline was inundated with calls from people concerned they
drank tainted water and hundreds of people reported upset stomachs.
The parasites have an incubation period of about a week, so any
serious health problems were expected to develop next week.
	   Giardia, normally spread through human or animal fecal matter,
can cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems.
Cryptosporidium is spread in similar fashion. It causes flu-like
symptoms and can kill people with weak immune systems, such as the
very young and the elderly.
	   Cryptosporidium got into Milwaukee's water supply in 1993,
killing about 100 people. More than 400,000 others got sick.
	   Craig Knowles, urban affairs minister for New South Wales state,
said the public no longer trusted Sydney Water and the government
had taken over management of the issue.
	   Knowles said an independent inquiry will examine why only
southern Sydney residents were warned Thursday even though the
water filtration plant served the entire city.
	   ``I want them (the inquiry) to put on record whether there has
been a bungle in not extending the area of alert to the entire
Sydney region in the first place,'' Knowles said.
	   Knowles blamed rotting animal carcasses in a canal near the
water plant for the contamination.
	   Sydney Water Managing Director Chris Pollett said, ``We found
carcasses, dogs and foxes. ...The dogs were not actually in the
canals they were outside, but we think the foxes might have been in
the water.''
	   Pollet, however, has said the contamination may have come from
run-off that already had been contaminated with parasites.
	   Water mains have been opened, and water gushed down curbs while
the system was flushed. Pollett said all Sydney residents should be
keep alert for water contamination until Sunday morning.
	   Knowles said water had begun to test clear and the system should
be flushed of the parasites over the weekend. But he said the
government would not take Sydney Water's word on whether the water
was safe and would establish an independent committee of
microbiologists to determine when to give the all-clear.
	   Sydney Water revealed that the water treatment plant did not
filter for giardia, a situation described as farcical by state
political opposition leader Peter Collins.
	   ``This is like an episode of `Yes Minister,''' Collins said,
referring to a British TV comedy. ``You've got Sydney Water saying
`But we've complied with the guidelines' _ the problem is you can't
drink the water that's provided under the guidelines.''

Mets acquire Phillips from Toronto
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The New York Mets finally got Tony Phillips.
	   After turning down a chance to sign the outfielder last spring,
the Mets acquired him from the Toronto Blue Jays on Friday night
for minor leaguer right-hander Leoncio Estrella.
	   ``I'm sure he will find himself in the leadoff spot in our
lineup quite a lot,'' Mets general manager Steve Phillips said.
	   The deal came several hours after the Mets traded outfielder
Bernard Gilkey, minor league right-hander Nelson Figueroa and cash
to the Arizona Diamondbacks for right-hander Willie Blair (4-15,
5.34), catcher Jorge Fabregas and a player to be named.
	   Phillips, 39, was arrested last Aug. 10 at an Anaheim motel.
Police said he was trying to purchase dlrs 30 dollars worth of
cocaine, and he later pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor.
	   The Angels attempted to suspend Phillips but the penalty was
overturned by baseball's arbitration panel. He then became a free
agent on Dec. 20 when Anaheim failed to offer him a 1998 contract,
but Phillips wasn't able to come up with a deal during spring
training.
	   The Mets who have only 51 stolen bases, have been looking to
upgrade their speed. Phillips will play second and third base and
see time in the outfield.
	   Toronto signed Phillips on July 1, and he hit .348 in 12 games,
with one homer and six RBIs. He is joining his sixth team during a
16-year major league career. Estrella, 23, was 10-8 with a 3.93 ERA
with Class-A Capital City of the South Atlantic League.

	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ World champions Elena Berezhnaya and
Anton Sikharulidze won the Goodwill Games' gold medal in pairs
skating Friday night, beating archrivals Artur Dmitriev and Oksana
Kazakova.
	   The bronze medal went to Dorota Zagorska and Mariusz Siudek of
Poland, who overtook Xue Shen and Hongo Zhao of China.
	   Wearing maroon skating outfits that included an evening coat and
striped cravat for Sikharulidze, the couple protected the lead they
had earned in the short program with a flowing 4 1/2 minutes on the
Nassau Coliseum ice.
	   The Olympic silver medalists earned three 5.8s and a 5.9 from
the Chinese judge for presentation.
	   It marked the second straight gold in major international
competition for Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze, whose first place at
the worlds was somewhat tainted by the withdrawal of Dmitriev and
Kazakova because of food poisoning.
	   Just weeks earlier, Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze had finished
second to Dmitriev and Kazakova in a battle of Russians for the
Olympic gold.
	   Dmitriev and Kazakova, second before the free skate, experienced
some rough moments.
	   They were slightly out of synch on a side-by-side double axel
into a double toe loop near the start of their program and Kazakova
slipped, losing her balance for an instant.
	   They received no mark higher than 5.8 and got a 5.2 for
technical merit from the United States judge.

American men swimmers defeated by World All-Stars

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ The loss to Germany was painful. This
time, the defeat was downright embarrassing.
	   A team of World All-Stars used six 1-2 sweeps in individual
events Friday night to hand the U.S. men swimmers a 78-43 loss in a
Goodwill Games' dual meet.
	   The Americans, who narrowly lost to Germany when they were
defeated in the 400-meter freestyle relay _ an event they've won at
every Olympics _ started OK against the World team by winning the
400 medley relay for a 7-0 lead.
	   But the World team then went 1-2 in five of the next seven
events for a 46-24 lead that the Americans never challenged. Among
the sweeps was in the 50 freestyle, where world champion Bill
Pilczuk of Auburn, Alabama, finished third behind Lorenzo Vismara
of Italy and Ricardo Busquets of Puerto Rico.
	   U.S. men traditionally have had a wealth of speedy freestylers,
but the embarrassment in the sprints continued with another sweep
by the World All-Stars in the 100.
	   Fernando Scherer of Brazil became the fourth man in history to
break 49 seconds in the event, joining Americans Matt Biondi and
Gary Hall Jr., and Russian Aleksandr Popov, the world record-holder
at 48.21 seconds. Scherer was timed in 48.91, and Pieter van den
Hoogenband of the Netherlands was second in 49.61.
	   The final indignity came in the 400 freestyle relay, as the
World team, anchored by Scherer, won in 3:22.42 _ 2.73 seconds
ahead of the Americans.
	   There were a few U.S. highlights. World champion Lenny
Krayzelburg of Los Angeles won the 200 backstroke in 1:58.17, a
Goodwill record and the ninth-fastest time in history. Josh Davis
of San Antonio captured the 200 freestyle and Kurt Grote of San
Diego, California, won the 100 breaststroke.
	   World champions Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze of
Russia won the gold medal for pairs figure skating, beating
archrivals Artur Dmitriev and Oksana Kazakova.
	   The bronze medal went to Dorota Zagorska and Mariusz Siudek of
Poland, who overtook Xue Shen and Hongo Zhao of China.
	   There will be a new champion in women's beach volleyball.
Defending gold medalists Karolyn Kirby and Liz Masakayan of San
Diego lost to Brazil's top-seeded Shelda Bede and Adriana Behar
15-9.
	   Bede and Behar scored nine straight points for a 10-1 lead, then
four of the last five points to wrap it up. In between, the U.S.
pair scored seven of eight points with play that brought back
visions of their days at the top: an ace, three kills and a block
by Kirby, and pressure behind Masakayan's serve.
	   ``Once we started getting points, it was really the old Liz and
Karolyn started coming back, where we started gaining some
confidence and we had something we could work with,'' the
37-year-old Kirby said. ``It's just too bad we didn't think of that
a little bit earlier.''
	   Masakayan and Kirby's last chance of advancing to Saturday's
semifinals ended when Pauline Manser and Kerri Pottharst of
Australia beat winless Kristine Drakich and Guylaine Dumont of
Canada 15-8.
	   Also reaching the final four were Americans Holly McPeak and
Lisa Arce, who beat Maike Friedrichsen and Danja Musch of Germany
15-11, and Italy's Laura Bruschini and Annamaria Solazzi.
	   As boxing prepared to crown its first champions, four referees
and judges accused of bias against Russian boxers were suspended by
AIBA, the international amateur boxing federation.
	   AIBA said it took the action after evaluating the Russian Boxing
Federation's protest ``that judgments made by the officials were
biased and led to the elimination of their boxers.''
	   Suspended for the rest of the games were referee-judges Macario
Sosa of Guatemala and Alfredo Toledo of Cuba; referee Per-Olaf
Larsson of Sweden; and judge Dieter Mika of Germany.
	   The bouts involved were not identified, but Russia's boxers had
two tough nights in the semifinals, with only four of 14 advancing.
	   Meanwhile, the Chinese gymnast paralyzed in a Goodwill Games
accident began rehabilitation at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan.
	   Doctors and therapists will try to return 17-year-old Sang Lan
to as normal a life as possible. But Dr. Kristjan T. Ragnarsson
said Sang has been told she likely never will walk again, much less
compete.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Its main water system infested with
parasites, the city that will host the 2000 Olympics is having a
tough time facing the international community. Even visiting U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has been warned: ``Don't
drink the water.''
	   The parasites giardia and cryptosporidium were found throughout
the system Wednesday and Thursday, and authorities admitted failing
consumers by not issuing early warnings to all residents. Prime
Minister John Howard labeled the health scare an international
embarrassment.
	   ``Of course it's embarrassing,'' Howard told a radio station
Friday. ``It's one of those unexpected things and everybody here's
hoping it will be fixed up as soon as possible.''
	   Albright and U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, in Australia
for annual consultations with their counterparts, arrived at the
Intercontinental Hotel on Thursday to be greeted by bellhops with a
friendly reminder not to drink the water.
	   Millions of residents resorted Friday to boiled or bottled water
and authorities tried to determine whether dead dogs and foxes were
the sources of the contamination.
	   Supermarkets reported panic-buying of bottled water and vendors
sold small bottles of water to drivers at stoplights. Millions of
people had to boil water to make it safe to drink.
	   A hotline was inundated with calls from people concerned they
drank tainted water and hundreds of people reported upset stomachs.
The parasites have an incubation period of about a week, so any
serious health problems were expected to develop next week.
	   Giardia, normally spread through human or animal fecal matter,
can cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems.
Cryptosporidium is spread in similar fashion. It causes flu-like
symptoms and can kill people with weak immune systems, such as the
very young and the elderly.
	   Cryptosporidium got into Milwaukee's water supply in 1993,
killing about 100 people. More than 400,000 others got sick.
	   Craig Knowles, urban affairs minister for New South Wales state,
said the public no longer trusted Sydney Water and the government
had taken over management of the issue.
	   Knowles said an independent inquiry will examine why only
southern Sydney residents were warned Thursday even though the
water filtration plant served the entire city.
	   ``I want them (the inquiry) to put on record whether there has
been a bungle in not extending the area of alert to the entire
Sydney region in the first place,'' Knowles said.
	   Knowles blamed rotting animal carcasses in a canal near the
water plant for the contamination.
	   Sydney Water Managing Director Chris Pollett said, ``We found
carcasses, dogs and foxes. ...The dogs were not actually in the
canals they were outside, but we think the foxes might have been in
the water.''
	   Pollet, however, has said the contamination may have come from
run-off that already had been contaminated with parasites.
	   Water mains have been opened, and water gushed down curbs while
the system was flushed. Pollett said all Sydney residents should be
keep alert for water contamination until Sunday morning.
	   Knowles said water had begun to test clear and the system should
be flushed of the parasites over the weekend. But he said the
government would not take Sydney Water's word on whether the water
was safe and would establish an independent committee of
microbiologists to determine when to give the all-clear.
	   Sydney Water revealed that the water treatment plant did not
filter for giardia, a situation described as farcical by state
political opposition leader Peter Collins.
	   ``This is like an episode of `Yes Minister,''' Collins said,
referring to a British TV comedy. ``You've got Sydney Water saying
`But we've complied with the guidelines' _ the problem is you can't
drink the water that's provided under the guidelines.''

Four officials kicked out of Goodwill after Russian protest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more quotes and details. &QL; 
 &UR; By ED SCHUYLER JR. &QC; 
 &UR; AP Boxing Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A protest and threat by the Russian Boxing
Federation led to the suspension of four officials from the finals
of the Goodwill Games.
	   Arthur Tunstall of Australia, technical delegate to the
competition from AIBA, the International Amateur Boxing
Association, said Friday that the Russians did not protest specific
bouts but were generally unhappy with judging in bouts involving
their boxers.
	   Suspended were referee-judges Macario Sosa of Guatemala and
Alfredo Toledo of Cuba, referee Per-Olof Larsson of Sweden and
judge Dieter Mica of Germany.
	   ``They were not happy and said they might take their boys
home,'' Tunstall said of the Russians, who had two finalists in
Friday night's six bouts and two boxers in Saturday night's six
finals.
	   Tunstall said the Russians agreed to keep their fighters in the
tournament after the AIBA announced its action.
	   ``We didn't pay much attention to their pulling their boys out
because that would have had dire circumstances,'' said Herb
Embuldeniya of Canada, a member of the AIBA international jury.
	   He said forfeiting the finals bouts could have led to the
suspension of Russian boxers in future international competitions.
	   ``Certainly we are pleased that the Russians have decided to
continue in the program,'' Tunstall said.
	   Tunstall also said, ``Boxing, as we know, is always a
controversial sport.''
	   AIBA said it took the action after evaluating the Russian
protest ``that judgments made by the officials were biased and led
to the elimination of their boxers.''
	   ``Upon review of the judgments, it was decided by the AIBA
international jury that suspensions of certain officials were
warranted,'' Tunstall said. ``It is an unfortunate incident, but we
hope the AIBA action puts to rest any remaining questions or
concerns.''
	   Russia's boxers had two tough nights in the semifinals. Only
four of 14 Russian semifinalists advanced, and just one of them _
featherweight Andrei Kozlovsky's 3-2 win over Michael Evans of the
United States _ won a close decision.
	   The losses included a tiebreak given to American lightweight
Jacob Hudson over Aleksandr Leonov and a 12-11 decision to U.S.
light welterweight Ebo Elder over Dmitri Pavluchenkov.
	   Goodwill Games officials said the rest of the tournament would
take place as scheduled, despite the officiating pool being reduced
to nine referee/judges for the last 12 bouts.
	   ``We regret that such action was necessary during this exciting
boxing competition,'' Goodwill Games president Mike Plant said.
``This decision is the most appropriate for all parties concerned,
and we respect the action taken.''

Jamaica beats Trinidad and Tobago 2-1 to take Caribbean Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad and Tobago (AP) _ Jamaica's ``Reggae
Boyz'' confirmed they are the class of the region's soccer Friday,
beating host Trinidad and Tobago 2-1 in the finals of the Shell
Caribbean Cup.
	   The Jamaicans took advantage of gaping holes in the defense of
the home team, which seemed to be having more trouble with the wet,
slushy conditions. O'Neil McDonald opened the scoring in the 20th
minute and Dean Sewell made it 2-0 in minute 34.
	   However, inspired by a large crowd at Hasely Crawford Stadium,
Trinidad and Tobago came out fired up in the second half and nearly
scored within a minute on a shot by Irasto Knight.
	   John Stern _ the tournament's Most Valuable Player and leading
scorer with 10 goals _ rose above the entire Jamaican defense in
the 48th minute to reduce the deficit to 2-1.
	   But despite concerted pressure, Jamaican goalie Clayton Ince was
able to deny the equalizer with a series of timely saves.
	   Jamaica wins U.S. dlrs 20,000 and becomes Shell Caribbean Cup
champion for the third time in the tournament's 10-year history.
	   Both teams played without several key players. Jamaica was
without Walter Boyd, who served out a two-match suspension for
elbowing, and several English league professionals who have
returned to their clubs. Trinidad and Tobago was without strikers
Jerren Nixon and Swight Yorke and midfielder Russell Latapy.

Former Khmer Rouge arrested for murder of Western tourists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A former Khmer Rouge general wanted
for the abduction and murder of three Western tourists in 1994 has
been arrested and brought to Phnom Penh, an interior ministry
official said Saturday.
	   ``Nuon Paet was arrested this morning and taken to Phnom Penh,''
said the chief of the information department in the Interior
Minister, Sok Phal. He gave no other details.
	   Nuon Paet led a band of Khmer Rouge guerrillas that halted a
train in 1994 and abducted David Wilson of Australia, Mark Slater
of Britain and Jean-Michel Braquet of France.
	   The guerrillas, holed up on rugged Vine Mountain in the southern
province of Kampot, held three months of protracted negotiations
with the government before killing their captives.
	   There are conflicting reports about where Sunday's arrest took
place.
	   Sim Theng, a former Khmer Rouge division commander, told the
Associated Press last year that Nuon Paet had disguised himself and
attempted to hide among the estimated 10,000 guerrillas who have
defected to the government since August, 1996.
	   The defections, initiated by high-ranking Khmer Rouge figure
Ieng Sary, have crippled the revolutionary movement and given the
country its best chance for peace in decades.
	   The Khmer Rouge seized power in 1975 and killed an estimated 2
million Cambodians in a bid to create a communist agrarian utopia.
It warred against successive central governments after it was
overthrown by a Vietnamese invasion in 1979.

Unit next? &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Dodgers-Expos, Mets-Blue Jays trades &QL; 
 &UR; By BEN WALKER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Baseball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Trade rumors turned into reality with Todd
Stottlemyre, Royce Clayton and Todd Zeile going to the Texas
Rangers and Juan Guzman, Carlos Perez and Ellis Burks also
switching teams.
	   But as the non-waiver trading deadline of midnight EDT (0400 GMT
Saturday) approached, all of baseball was still waiting and
watching for one big deal: Would the Seattle Mariners move Randy
Johnson?
	   The New York Yankees, Cleveland, Los Angeles and Atlanta were
said to be pursuing the 1995 American League Cy Young winner.
	   Texas, meanwhile, turned down a chance to get four-time Cy Young
winner Roger Clemens after Toronto insisted on obtaining outfielder
Rusty Greer.
	   By 9:30 p.m. EDT (0130 GMT), there had been eight trades
involving 28 players, including 16 major leaguers. Mark
Grudzielanek, Willie Blair and Tony Phillips were among those on
the move.
	   And there was speculation more deals would follow, with the
names of Randy Myers, Roberto Hernandez, Denny Neagle and Robin
Ventura mentioned most prominently.
	   The Rangers, who began the day one game behind Anaheim in the AL
West, got busy early. They acquired Stottlemyre and Clayton from
St. Louis for pitcher Darren Oliver and third baseman Fernando
Tatis, and got Zeile from Florida for a pair of minor leaguers.
	   St. Louis, which last year got Mark McGwire only hours before
the trading deadline, gave up two players eligible for free agency
at the end of the season.
	   Stottlemyre, 33, was 9-9 this season with a 3.51 ERA. Clayton,
28, was hitting just .234 with four homers and 29 RBIs at
shortstop.
	   Oliver, 27, was 6-7 with a 6.53 ERA in 19 starts for Texas.
Tatis, 23, is hitting .270 with three homers and 32 RBIs.
	   Zeile was traded for the second time this season, having gone
from Los Angeles to Florida in May as part of the deal involving
Mike Piazza. Zeile, 32, is hitting .276 with 13 homers and 66 RBIs.
	   The deal cut the Marlins' payroll to dlrs 14.2 million _ it was
dlrs 53 million when they won last year's World Series. Florida got
third base prospect Jose Santo and pitcher Daniel DeYoung for
Zeile.
	   The Los Angeles Dodgers, already in the middle of several big
deals this season, bolstered themselves for a wild-card run by
getting Perez, Grudzielanek and a prospect from Montreal for second
baseman Wilton Guerrero and three minor leaguers.
	   The Expos got pitcher Ted Lilly, outfielder Peter Bergeron and
first baseman Jonathan Tucker in addition to Guerrero. The Dodgers
also got minor league outfielder Hiram Bocachica.
	   Perez was 7-10 with a 3.75 ERA in 23 starts. Grudzielanek, 28,
who tied the major league record for doubles by a shortstop with 54
last season, was batting .276 with eight homers and 41 RBIs.
	   Baltimore, eight games behind Boston in the AL wild-card chase,
acquired Guzman from Toronto for pitcher Nerio Rodriguez and minor
league outfielder Shannon Carter.
	   Guzman, 31, was 6-12 with a 4.41 ERA. He pitched eight strong
innings Thursday night in a 1-0 win over Texas, then said he
expected to be traded at any moment.
	   The San Francisco Giants, bidding for the National League
wild-card spot, traded Darryl Hamilton, minor league pitcher James
Stoops and a player to be named to Colorado for Burks in a swap of
33-year-old outfielders.
	   In a swap of slumping players, the New York Mets traded
outfielder Bernard Gilkey to Arizona for Willie Blair, who leads
the majors in losses.
	   Gilkey, 31, was hitting .227 in 82 games. He sustained a stress
fracture in his left elbow early this year and was on the disabled
list from April 26 to May 11.

Olympic City says ``Welcome, but don't drink the water''

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia's premier harbor city is
surrounded by water but without a drop to drink after dangerous
bacterial parasites invaded the whole water distribution system.
	   Sydney's 3.7 million residents continued boiling water Saturday
for drinking, cooking and tooth-brushing to kill the parasites
giardia and cryptosporidium, discovered in city water this week.
	   Prime Minister John Howard called the problem an international
embarrassment for the city that will host the Olympics in two
years.
	   Federal Sports Minister Andrew Thompson added: ``Having gone to
the trouble of winning the Olympics, the very least a state
government could do is make sure that the water is not poisonous.''
	   A spokeswoman for state Urban Affairs and Planning Minister
Craig Knowles said experts will look at water tests Saturday and
make a decision on the safety of the water supply by the evening.
	   Meanwhile, an independent inquiry set up by the government has
begun examining why only southern Sydney residents were warned
about the contamination on Thursday, even though the filtration
plant at fault served all of Sydney.
	   Public anger is at the boiling point. A Sydney Water repair crew
working on broken pipes in the city was pelted with stones Friday,
the Australian Services Union said. None of the crew members were
hurt.
	   Law firms placed ads in newspapers Saturday seeking clients to
join a class action lawsuit against Sydney Water. One firm, Slater
and Gordon, said Sydney Water's compensation bill would almost
certainly run into tens of millions of dollars.
	   Supermarkets reported sales of bottled water skyrocketed 300
percent, with many store shelves emptying out as panicked customers
bought cases at a time.
	   An estimated U.S. dlrs 1.8 million (3 million Australian
dollars) in bottled water was sold in the last three days,
retailers estimated.
	   The source of the contamination is unclear.
	   Knowles on Friday said dead dogs had been found in an open canal
leading to the water filtration plant found to have been spreading
the parasites.
	   ``We found carcasses, dogs and foxes. ...The dogs were not
actually in the canals they were outside, but we think the foxes
might have been in the water,'' said Sydney Water Managing Director
Chris Pollett.
	   Pollett, however, has said the contamination may have come from
run-off that already had been contaminated with parasites.
	   No serious illnesses have been reported yet by hospitals. But
the parasites have an incubation period of about a week, so any
serious health problems were expected to develop next week.
	   Giardia, normally spread through human or animal fecal matter,
can cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems.
Cryptosporidium is spread in similar fashion. It causes flu-like
symptoms and can kill people with weak immune systems, such as the
very young and the elderly.
	   Cryptosporidium got into the water supply of Milwaukee,
Wisconsin in 1993, killing about 100 people. More than 400,000
others got sick.
	   Water mains have been opened, and water gushed down curbs while
the system was flushed. Pollett said all Sydney residents should be
keep alert for water contamination until Sunday morning.
	   Knowles said water had begun to test clear and the system should
be flushed of the parasites over the weekend. But he said the
government would not take Sydney Water's word on whether the water
was safe and would establish an independent committee of
microbiologists to determine when to give the all-clear.
	   Sydney Water revealed that the water treatment plant did not

political opposition leader Peter Collins.
	   ``This is like an episode of `Yes Minister,''' Collins said,
referring to a British TV comedy. ``You've got Sydney Water saying
`But we've complied with the guidelines' _ the problem is you can't
drink the water that's provided under the guidelines.''

U.S. Defense Secretary Cohen meets Indonesia military chiefs

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen,
who has urged the Indonesian military to show restraint as their
nation moves toward democracy, met top military brass Saturday at
the beginning of a two-day visit.
	   Cohen arrived in Jakarta late Friday from Sydney, where he and
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright took part in annual
talks on the state of U.S.-Australian relations.
	   He met Indonesia's armed forces chief, Gen. Wiranto, at the
defense ministry and was scheduled to hold talks with President
B.J. Habibie later Friday morning. On Sunday, he planned to fly to
the Philippines, the next leg on his regional tour.
	   Cohen suspended joint U.S. military training in Indonesia in May
amid rioting and protests that ended the 32-year authoritarian rule
of former President Suharto. The United States wants to resume some
military programs with the Indonesian armed forces, which have been
tainted by allegations of human rights abuses.
	   In Sydney, Cohen said that the United States had maintained
military contacts to urge restraint as Indonesia endures its worst
economic crisis in decades. U.S. officials have praised the
military for backing the transition from Suharto to his civilian
successor, Habibie.
	   Human rights groups have accused Indonesian military units, some
with U.S. training, of widespread abuses.
	   Prior to Suharto's downfall, security forces killed four
students at a demonstration in Jakarta, unleashing the citywide
rioting in which 1,200 people were killed.
	   Critics have also accused the armed forces of responding slowly
to much of the rioting and of failing to thoroughly investigate
reports that rioters raped ethnic Chinese women.
	   Additionally, the military has been tainted by its alleged
involvement in the kidnapping of pro-democracy activists earlier
this year. Eleven members of an elite army unit have been arrested.

American men swimmers defeated by World All-Stars

	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ For U.S. men's swimming, it's never
been this bad.
	   Even when American women struggled in the pool with the rise of
East Germany in the 1970s and China in the '90s, the guys always
found a way to win more than their share.
	   With the Olympics coming up in two years, it looks now like the
men's team has a long way to go to catch up with the women, are
undefeated in two Goodwill Games dual meets. The men are 0-2 after
a 78-43 thrashing by a World All-Star team Friday night.
	   ``I saw my mom in the stands and she made eye contact with me
and said, `Good job,''' said Bill Pilczuk of Auburn, Alabama, a
world champion this year in the 50-meter freestyle, but third to
two World teamers. ``I just rolled my eyes and said `Sheesh.'''
	   Wednesday's loss to Germany was painful. This time, the defeat
was downright embarrassing, with six 1-2 sweeps by the World team
in 12 individual events.
	   ``Americans come in to win every race, every day,'' said Josh
Davis of San Antonio, one of the few U.S. winners. ``Wednesday was
just a bad day in the office. It was an off day. We pride ourselves
on having one of the strongest swimming programs.''
	   The Americans, who lost to Germany on the final race, the
400-meter freestyle relay _ an event they've won at every Olympics
_ started OK against the World team by winning the 400 medley relay
for a 7-0 lead.
	   But the World team then went 1-2 in five of the next seven
events for a 46-24 lead that the Americans never challenged. Among
the sweeps was in the 50 freestyle, where Pilczuk finished third
behind Lorenzo Vismara of Italy and Ricardo Busquets of Puerto
Rico.
	   ``I would've liked to have another meet where it came down to
the free relay, but it didn't work out that way,'' U.S. men's coach
Bill Wadley said.
	   U.S. men traditionally included a wealth of speedy freestylers,
but the embarrassment in the sprints continued with another World
sweep in the 100.
	   Fernando Scherer of Brazil became the fourth man in history to
break 49 seconds in the event, joining Americans Matt Biondi and
Gary Hall Jr., and Russian Aleksandr Popov, the world record-holder
at 48.21 seconds. Scherer was timed in 48.91, and Pieter van den
Hoogenband of the Netherlands was second in 49.61.
	   ``I knew I had swum a great race when I finished, but I wasn't
sure how good my time would be,'' said Scherer, who was fifth in
the Olympic 100 free two years ago. ``I felt great until the last 5
meters, when my legs felt dead.''
	   The final indignity came in the 400 freestyle relay, as the
World team, anchored by Scherer, won in 3:22.42 _ 2.73 seconds
ahead of the Americans.
	   ``This is the fastest pool I've ever been in,'' Scherer said.
	   Few Americans would agree, but there were a few U.S. highlights.
	   World champion Lenny Krayzelburg of Los Angeles won the 200
backstroke in 1:58.17, a Goodwill record and the ninth-fastest time
in history. Davis captured the 200 freestyle and Kurt Grote of San
Diego, California won the 100 breaststroke.
	   ``The World team is a lot stronger than the rest of the
competition,'' Davis said. ``They have an advantage because they
have some of the best in the world mixed on one team.''
	   World champions Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze of
Russia won the gold medal in pairs figure skating, beating
archrivals Artur Dmitriev and Oksana Kazakova. The bronze went to
Dorota Zagorska and Mariusz Siudek of Poland.
	   There will be a new champion in women's beach volleyball.
Defending gold medalists Karolyn Kirby and Liz Masakayan of San
Diego lost to Brazil's top-seeded Shelda Bede and Adriana Behar
15-9.
	   Bede and Behar scored nine straight points for a 10-1 lead, then
four of the last five points to wrap it up. In between, the U.S.
pair scored seven of eight points with play that brought back
visions of their days at the top: an ace, three kills and a block
by Kirby, and pressure behind Masakayan's serve.
	   ``Once we started getting points, it was really the old Liz and
Karolyn started coming back, where we started gaining some
confidence and we had something we could work with,'' the
37-year-old Kirby said. ``It's just too bad we didn't think of that
a little bit earlier.''
	   Masakayan and Kirby's last chance of advancing to Saturday's
semifinals ended when Pauline Manser and Kerri Pottharst of
Australia beat winless Kristine Drakich and Guylaine Dumont of
Canada 15-8.
	   Also reaching the final four were Americans Holly McPeak and
Lisa Arce, who beat Maike Friedrichsen and Danja Musch of Germany
15-11, and Italy's Laura Bruschini and Annamaria Solazzi.
	   As boxing prepared to crown its first champions, four referees
and judges accused of bias against Russian boxers were suspended by
AIBA, the international amateur boxing federation.
	   Suspended for the rest of the games were referee-judges Macario
Sosa of Guatemala and Alfredo Toledo of Cuba; referee Per-Olaf
Larsson of Sweden; and judge Dieter Mika of Germany.

Agassi, Henman advance to semifinals

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Andre Agassi kept up his recent habit of
speedy victories, defeating Australian Sandon Stolle 7-6 (7-2), 6-2
Thursday in just over an hour to advance to the Mercedes Cup
semifinals.
	   Agassi won his ninth straight match without dropping a set since
Wimbledon. His streak includes a title last week at Washington,
where his matches averaged 59 minutes. He beat Stolle in 1 hour, 20
minutes.
	   ``I tend to walk quick, but when it comes time to serve I slow
it down,'' he said. ``I don't think I rush out there.''
	   Agassi advanced to Saturday's semifinals, where he'll play
either top-seeded Patrick Rafter or Justin Gimelstob, who met in a
night match.
	   In other quarterfinals, No. 2 seed Tim Henman beat No. 7 Bryon
Black 5-7, 6-1, 6-4 and Guillaume Raoux of France outlasted local
favorite Michael Joyce 6-7 (7-9), 6-4, 7-5.
	   Agassi didn't take the court until after the two previous
matches went three sets. By then, the sun was going down and
towering trees on the UCLA campus cast long shadows across the
court.
	   ``You can't see the ball at all that time of day,'' he said.
``My game is based around hitting the ball cleanly and I didn't
have any confidence at all the first set that I could swing and hit
it cleanly in the shadows.''
	   Agassi's coach, Brad Gilbert, came on the court during the first
changeover in the second set, part of the ATP Tour's experiment
with coaching during matches. Los Angeles is the final stop in a
five-tournament experiment.
	   ``He was trying to get me to swing out on my shots because I
couldn't see with the shadows,'' said Agassi, who played his first
two matches here at night. ``I'm not used to playing at that time
of day.''
	   Agassi broke Stolle to take a 2-0 lead after Gilbert's
two-minute pep talk. He fought off triple break point in the fifth
game and took a 4-1 lead when Stolle netted a forehand volley.
	   Stolle, whose father, Fred, won the doubles title here in 1968
with Ken Rosewall, held serve to trail 4-2. But Agassi held serve
with an ace and then broke Stolle on his second match point to win.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A former Khmer Rouge general wanted
for the abduction and murder of three Western tourists in 1994 has
been arrested and brought to Phnom Penh, an interior ministry
official said Saturday.
	   ``Nuon Paet was arrested this morning and taken to Phnom Penh,''
said the chief of the information department in the Interior
Minister, Sok Phal.
	   Nuon Paet led a band of Khmer Rouge guerrillas that halted a
train in 1994 and abducted three Western tourists: David Wilson of
Australia, Mark Slater of Britain and Jean-Michel Braquet of
France.
	   Ambassadors from the countries of the victims met Saturday
morning with Cambodia's top leader, Co-Premier Hun Sen, to discuss
the arrest.
	   The guerrillas, holed up on rugged Vine Mountain in the southern
province of Kampot, held three months of protracted negotiations
with the government before killing their captives.
	   There are conflicting reports about where Saturday's arrest took
place.
	   Sim Theng, a former Khmer Rouge division commander, told The
Associated Press last year that Nuon Paet had disguised himself and
attempted to defect among the estimated 10,000 guerrillas who have
laid down their arms since August, 1996.
	   The defections, initiated by high-ranking Khmer Rouge figure
Ieng Sary, have crippled the revolutionary movement and given the
country its best chance for peace in decades.
	   The Khmer Rouge seized power in 1975 and killed as many as 2
million Cambodians in a bid to create a communist agrarian utopia.
It battled successive central governments after it was overthrown
in 1979 by a Vietnamese invasion.

Political violence in southern Mexico two days before state
</HEADLINE>
election &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YAITEPEC, Mexico (AP) _ Members of a leftist opposition party
engaged in a brief shootout with ruling-party supporters in
southern Oaxaca state just two days before gubernatorial elections
there. Three policemen were wounded in the confrontation.
	   The three policemen were ambushed, said state officials, who
offered no information on the condition of the wounded.
	   The shootout occurred about 70 miles (113 kilometers) south of
Oaxaca City in the village of Yaitepec, where politically-motivated
violence has occurred in past elections. The village was gripped by
a three-day running gun battle between local activists during
mayoral elections in 1995.
	   Oaxaca voters go the polls Sunday to elect the state's governor
and members of the state congress.
	   Manuel Leon Sanchez, a leader of the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party in the neighboring village of Juquila, accused
supporters of the left-center Democratic Revolution Party of
threatening to disrupt voting in Yaitepec.

Chiapas state funds allegedly used to defend massacre suspects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS (AP) _ A rights group protested
Friday what it claimed was the use of public funds to pay for
private lawyers for some of the 123 defendants charged in the Dec.
22 massacre of 45 women, children and men.
	   A Chiapas state official denied the accusation, saying the state
government had simply agreed to provide six more public defenders
for the suspects.
	   ``What public interest is served by spending state money for
this purpose? The state government ... should be the party most
interested in punishing those responsible'' for the massacre, the
Fray Bartolome de las Casas Human Rights Center said in a press
statement.
	   The group argued that, since federal prosecutors filed the
charges against the suspects, the federal government, not the
state, should make decisions about public defenders.
	   Ruling-party supporters are accused of carrying out the massacre
in the village of Acteal, Chiapas. The victims belonged to a group
that sympathizes with leftist rebels.
	   Zapatista rebels staged a brief armed uprising in Chiapas in
January 1994, demanding greater democracy and Indian rights.
