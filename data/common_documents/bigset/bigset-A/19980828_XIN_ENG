<HEADLINE> Canada's Central Bank Raises Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Canada's central bank raised
interest rates by one percentage point to six percent Thursday in
a desperate move to prop up its battered currency.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the Canadian dollar made a new record
Wednesday, dropping below 64 cents U.S. for the first time in its
140-year history.
</P>
<P>
During the past six months alone, the dollar has lost about 10
percent of its value against the strong U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
With the rate hike, the bank's operating band for the overnight
rate was similarly adjusted to a range of five to six percent.
</P>
<P>
"Today's increase in interest rates is aimed at providing
support for the Canadian dollar in order to bolster confidence,
while preserving monetary conditions that will help to sustain the
present non-inflationary expansion of the economy," the bank said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian dollar has been under persistent downward
pressure, which reflected an adjustment to increased economic
uncertainty in Asia, the associated downward pressure on the
prices of the primary commodities that Canada exports, and the
developing problems in Russia, it said.
</P>
<P>
"However, the currency decline has more recently developed a
momentum that, together with the upper pressure on medium and
longer-term interest rates, signals a diminishing of confidence in
Canadian dollar investments," it said.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, the depreciation of the currency has
resulted in a substantial easing of monetary conditions. While
some of this easing has been warranted by economic developments,
it is the bank's view that it has become excessive," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Canada has been resisting calls of interest rates
hike for fear of slowing the economy.
</P>
<P>
Despite its constant market interventions, the bank has failed
so far to halt the continuing slide of the Canadian dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian dollar was trading as low as 63.5 cents U.S. early
Thursday, which meant that in a 24-hour period it had dropped more
than one percent.

<HEADLINE> Suspects in Kenyan Embassy Bombing Sent to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Two suspects involved in the
bombing of U.S. embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, have been brought to
New York for trial, U.S. officials said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The first suspect, Khalid Salim, was flown by the FBI to New
York, the officials said. But the exact date of Salim's arrest
was not known.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. federal prosecutors said they expected the suspect
to be arraigned at midday in Manhattan federal court.
</P>
<P>
FBI Director Louis Freeh, Attorney General Janet Reno and
other senior U.S. government officials will hold a news
conference at 1 p.m. EDT (1700GMT) at FBI headquarters in
Washington "to announce developments in the investigation of the
bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania," the FBI
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Salim is suspected of throwing a hand grenade to guards
outside the Naairobi embassy at the start of the bombing attack,
a U.S. law enforcement official said in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Another suspect, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, was also flown to New
York, according to a diplomatic source in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Odeh has been held by Kenyan authorities since August 14, a
week after his arrest in Karachi, Pakistan, on the day of the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. officials said others among the several suspects in
custody in Kenya could also be sent to the United States for
trial.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan officials were said to be eager to seek justice for the
hundreds of Kenyan victims of the embassy bombing, but also wary
that a trial for an attack on a U.S. target in Kenya might invite
new terrorist assaults on Kenyan targets.

<HEADLINE> No More Aid for Russia without Reforms, Kohl Warns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 27 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
warned Thursday that Russia could not count on further financial
help, either from Germany or international financial institutions,
if it did not push through necessary economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Berlin on Thursday, Kohl said he is
"considerably concerned" about the recent financial turmoil in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he has kept frequent contact with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin and is also planning to speak to U.S.
President Bill Clinton, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and
French President Jacques Chirac about the situation in Russia.
</P>
<P>
As Russia's financial crisis continues to spin out of control,
there is growing alarm in Germany that the Russian turmoil could
soon have damaging economic consequences for the world economy and
hence for Germany, which is Russia's leading trade partner and
biggest lender.
</P>
<P>
Although the German government has been trying to convince
investors that any economic meltdown in Russia would only have
minor repercussions for Germany, some economists have warned that
if panic in Moscow triggers further instability in Asia and
Eastern Europe, the impact could be more devastating.

<HEADLINE> EU Calls for Immediate Ceasefire in DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Union called on
Thursday an immediate cease-fire in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation union expressed its grave concern through a
written statement issued by the Austrian presidency.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the ongoing crisis in the DRC and the
wider dangers for the region can only be solved through a
negotiated settlement acceptable to all Congolese that will allow
the DRC and other countries of the region to find peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
The European Union appreciated and supported the recent
mediation efforts undertaken by South African President Nelson
Mandela in his capacity as chairman of the Southern African
Development Community.
</P>
<P>
The union believes that an immediate cease-fire will be the
precondition for a political process that will lead up to
negotiations aimed at finding a solution to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The European Union, the statement added, remains ready to help
with the political dialogue and stands ready to support any
negotiation scheme designed to find the consent of all parties
involved.
</P>
<P>
A regional conference, the statement said, can provide the
opportunity for considering issues of a regional dimension and for
creating the mechanism to promote security and cooperation in the
region.

<P>
Ameenzadeh will call on Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and hold
formal talks with Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz on international,
regional and bilateral issues, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Ameenzadeh's visit follows a recent trip to Iran by Pakistan's
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Siddique Kahn Kanju.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan issue will prominently figure in the talks as Iran
is highly concerned over the recent offensives of the Taliban
militia in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Tension arose between Pakistan and Iran after Iranian diplomats
and a correspondent of Iranian News Agency (IRNA) got missing in
Mazar-i-Sharif early this month when the Taliban captured the
northern Afghan town.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Iran, Kanju renewed Pakistan's offer to
extend cooperation in resolving the diplomatic issue and other
issues. However, media reports have suggested that he failed to
convince the Iranian leadership of Pakistan's role in this regard.

UNITED NATIONS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Thursday appealed to Haitian authorities and
political leaders for a swift ratification of a new prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
The appeal is contained in his report on the United Nations
Civilian Police Mission in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
 In the report, the Secretary-General noted that Haiti is
still without a government. He highlighted the importance of
taking concrete steps to prepare for the next local and

The Secretary-General cited a widely accepted notion that
there will be a continuing need for international training of the
Haitian National Police.

<HEADLINE> Gullit Takes over Newcastle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Former Dutch international and
Chelsea manager Ruud Gullit replaced Kenny Dalglish as manager of
Newcastle United on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced on the London stock market, which
had seen the publicly listed club's shares climb over 10 percent
to 64p as rumors of Gullit's arrival strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Dalglish, who took over from Kevin Keegan in January 1997,
offered his resignation nine days ago, prompting the club to
approach Gullit, who was sacked by Chelsea in February and has
been out of management since then.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch's agent, Phil Smith, told BBC Radio that Gullit met
Newcastle directors in Amsterdam on Monday when he agreed in
principle to take over, pending the release of Dalglish.
</P>
<P>
Newcastle issued a statement on Thursday saying that Dalglish
had offered to stand down on August 18, three days after the
first game of the season - a 0-0 home draw with Charlton when the
team was booed off the pitch.
</P>
<P>
Dalglish said he did not want to leave until a replacement was
arranged.
</P>
<P>
Gullit's first match in charge will be Sunday's home game
against Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
Gullit has been out of the game since he was surprisingly
sacked by Chelsea in February, after leading them to their first
major trophy for 26 years, the 1997 F.A. Cup. He was the first
overseas coach to win one of English soccer's major trophies.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Taliban Chief representative
based in Islamabad Saeedur Rahman has twice rejected the
telephonic requests by U.S. embassy officials for talks, the News
Network International quoted diplomatic sources as saying
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We had received two phone calls from the U.S. embassy, seeking
appointment with ambassador Saeedur Rahman, but the request was
turned down twice," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the U.S. embassy are making requests for talks
on the basis of diplomatic contacts but Rahman expressed inability
to spare time for them, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
"There is no justification for talks with the Americans after
they launched air strikes in Afghanistan in violation of
international law and norms," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from the U.S. embassy said Tuesday that the U.S. was
ready to talk with the Taliban militia on Osama bin Laden and
other issues.
</P>
<P>
Top Taliban leader Muhammad Omar has already rejected the U.S.
offer for talks on Saudi dissident Osama. The Taliban militia have
ruled out any possibility of handing over Osama who is now in the
Taliban-controlled area in Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> UK Steps up Pressure on Libya over Lockerbie Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Labor government
Thursday stepped up pressure on Libya over Lockerbie bombing case,
calling on the Libyan government to hand over the two Libyan
bombing suspects to stand for trial in Hague.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told reporters early
Thursday: "I welcome the Libyan response. As far as it goes it is
the most positive response we have had for the last seven years."
</P>
<P>
"But it doesn't meet the acid test of handing over the two
accused to the Netherlands and until we get that, we can't be too
confident or too optimistic about any response."
</P>
<P>
The Libyan Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that it would
"respond positively" to the joint Anglo-American proposal but did
not specifically say Libya had accepted it.
</P>
<P>
Cook also noted that Britain wanted to see a trial start as
soon as possible, reaffirming if the two Libyans were handed over
for trial, Britain would support the suspension of international
sanctions against Libya.
</P>
<P>
Some 270 people were killed when a Pan AM airliner exploded
over the Scottish town of Lockerbie on December 21, 1988 and the
U.N. imposed strict international sanctions against Libya in 1992
after the Libyan government refused to hand over the alleged
bombers.

<HEADLINE> S. African Tourism Hurt by Bombing: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The South African
Environment and Tourism Ministry is to consult government's
tourism safety task group on ways of thwarting further acts of
terrorism, Tourism Minister Pallo Jordan said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He condemned Tuesday's blast at Cape Town's waterfront, a
popular tourism destination, as a senseless act of terrorism that
also inflicted untold damage on the economy.
</P>
<P>
"This act of terrorism, seen within the global context, hurts
our country's tourism industry," he said. "Those responsible for
this blast clearly acted to harm our country and its people."
</P>
<P>
One person was killed and 27 injured in the powerful bomb
blast in a U.S.-franchised restaurant at 7:20 p.m. local time
Tuesday. It appeared to be linked to U.S. strikes against
alleged Muslim terrorists in Sudan and Afghanistan last week.
</P>
<P>
Among the wounded are five of a British family of six, who
arrived at Cape Town Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The British government has advised all British nationals to be
vigilant when visiting South Africa, noting that there were high
levels of violence in the country.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. embassy in South Africa also asked American citizens
in the country to take extra precautions.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is an important industry in South Africa and Cape Town
is a major tourist attraction in the country.
</P>
<P>
The tourism safety task group run by the Tourism Ministry,
includes representatives of the police, the Foreign Ministry,
South African Tourism Board (Satour) and private sector
organizations.
</P>
<P>
It aims to find ways of making South Africa a safer
destination for tourists and creating a better overseas image of
this country.

<HEADLINE> Two Men Killed in Somalia Amid Insecurity Posed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The various types of weapons
including large explosives, land mines and hand grenades continue
posing mortal threats and increasing insecurity to the Somalis
around the country.
</P>
<P>
Two men were killed and another seriously wounded in the
Huriwa district of the capital Mogadishu controlled by faction
leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred when a hand grenade carried by one of
the deceased exploded inside a garage near the SOS hospital at
about 10:00 am local time.
</P>
<P>
The seriously wounded man has been rushed to Ali Hassan
private clinic for treatment where his condition is reported to
be serious, but stable.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the explosion is not clear. However, several
men inside the same garage said the hand grenade was a bad one
and its holder never believed it would trigger off. Some
believed the bomb was heated up by the hot temperature inside the
garage.
</P>
<P>
Exactly ten days ago, two men were killed and four others
wounded when a similar hand grenade exploded inside a mosque in
the southern port town of Kismaio, 500 km south of the capital.
</P>
<P>
According to people inside the mosque which is at the heart of
the town, the hand grenade exploded after it fell off the pocket
of one of the men as the worshippers tried to kneel down for
prayer. The owner of the grenade, a weapon seller, had himself
killed on the spot.
</P>
<P>
Carrying hand grenades has been a fashion especially in
Mogadishu nowadays as the number of gangs and looters increases
in the streets of the capital. Hand grenades are also used by
women selling kat as a threat against the bandits getting close
to them with pistols in an attempt to intimidate them.
</P>
<P>
Three people have been killed in separate incidents in the
capital since Wednesday. The reason for the shooting is
reportedly related to a new rivalry by two groups of gunmen in
the area.
</P>
<P>
As insecurity is everywhere, Radio Galkaio quoted a circular
by Colonel Abdullahi Yuss-uf Ahmed, the so-called president of
the disputed Puntland authority, ordered his ministers and the
commanders of the police stations Wednesday to take a firm step
against anyone seen to be erecting a roadblock.
</P>
<P>
The five-point circular prohibits all roadblocks in and
outside the towns and calls on people to implement the new
circular which also states that all culprits will be subjected to
Islamic courts.

Sri Lanka also believes that the struggle against terrorism

action but in full conformity with international law, the
principles of the U.N. Charter and respect for the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of all States, the release said.
</P>

extends their deepest sympathies to the innocent people of
Afghanistan and Sudan who have been affected by the loss of life

<HEADLINE> Arafat Not Optimistic About Advancement of Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat is not optimistic over the chances
to advance the stalled peace process, an Israeli legislator who
met Arafat Thursday said.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting in the West Bank town of Ramallah, Arafat told
Israeli Labor Knesset (Parliament) Member Salah Tarif that based
on the conditions imposed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, there is still a long way to go before an agreement
could be reached over the long overdue Israeli redeployment in the
West Bank, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's remarks were made several days after he sounded an
optimistic note on the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations over an
American proposal which calls for Israel to withdraw its troops
from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
When attending a ceremony marking the fifth anniversary of the
Oslo Accords in Norway, Arafat declared Monday that the latest
Israeli withdrawal proposals could be "a beginning" toward an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that in a written proposal given to the
Palestinians last week, Israel suggested that it withdraw from 10
percent of the West Bank and turn another 3 percent into a "nature
reserve" where the Palestinians would not be allowed to settle.
</P>
<P>
In an exchange for a possible Palestinian concession, Israel
reportedly gave up one of its key demands. It would not insist
that the Palestinian National Council (PNC) be reconvened, before
any agreement is to be reached, to annul those articles in the
Palestinian Covenant which calls for the destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli officials played down the optimism, saying there
is no development to indicate progress towards an
agreement. Netanyahu has also denied that Israel has given up its
demand on the reconvening of the PNC.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tarif told Israel Radio that Arafat condemned the
bombing attack Thursday morning in Tel Aviv which injured more
than 20 people, saying the PNA is taking measures to prevent any
violence against civilians.
</P>
<P>
Israel has accused Arafat of failing to publicly condemn the
two recent killings of Jewish settlers in the West Bank. Two
Jewish settlers were killed in a settlement near the West Bank
town of Nablus early this month and one rabbi was stabbed to
death in his home in Hebron a week ago.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets Over Draft Lockerbie Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Thursday went on with its meeting over a draft resolution,
introduced by America and Britain, one day after Libya announced
its acceptance of a American-British proposal on the trial of two
Lockerbie suspects in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Security Council went ahead with consultations
on the draft resolution despite Libyan earlier Wednesday asked
for a delay any council decision on the proposed resolution.
</P>
<P>
Later Wednesday, the Libyan Government said that it would
accept the U.S.-UK offer that the two Libyan suspects in the
bombing of an American airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in
December 1988. The blast claimed 270 lives, including 11 people
on the ground.
</P>
<P>
More details of the U.S.-UK proposal were revealed here
Thursday as the Security Council circulated as a document the
letter to the U.N. Secretary-General, dated August 24, from the
American and British acting permanent representatives to the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that the two suspected Libyans would be tried
in the Netherlands by a Scottish court under normal Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
"It would be a Scottish court and would follow normal Scots law
and procedure in every respect, except for the replacement of the
jury by a panel of three Scottish High Court judges," the letter
said. "The Scottish rules of evidence and procedure, and all the
guarantees of fair trial provided by the law of Scotland, would
apply."
</P>
<P>
The letter assured Libya of the safe passage of the two
suspects, and said that if found guilty, the two Libyans would
serve their sentence in Scotland,
</P>
<P>
In announcing its acceptance of the offer, the Libyan Government
also demanded a fair and just trial, and a complete end of the
sanctions imposed on it in 1992.
</P>
<P>
It remains unknown of the specific location of the trial to be
held in the Netherlands, accepted by Tripoli as "a neutral third
country." Diplomatic sources here said the Dutch authorities had
offered three sites to try the suspects, but The Hague, which
was originally thought of, was not among them.

<HEADLINE> Greece Reiterates Commitment to Defend Cyprus Militarily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Greece on Thursday reiterated its
commitment to defend Cyprus militarily in the event of a threat.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique issued after a two-hour talks between
Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis and visiting Cyprus President
Glafcos Clerides, Simitis said that the Greek government made it
clear to all that the Greek and Cypriot joint defense doctrine was
not restricted to defense planning, it constituted a commitment on
the part of Greece, the core of which was the Greek government's
decision to defend Cyprus militarily in the event of a threat.
</P>
<P>
Clerides, who arrived in Athens Wednesday for a two-day visit,
said that he was completely satisfied with his talks and welcomed
in particular Simitis's statement that any threat against Cyprus
would be confronted jointly.
</P>
<P>
On the deployment of Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles
in Cyprus, both sides stressed that there had been no decision to
postpone deployment of the missiles.
</P>
<P>
While stressing that the S-300 missiles were purely defensive,
they said that neither government wanted friction or tension and
that their only concern was to strengthen Cyprus' defenses in the
face of Turkey's constantly growing provocactiveness and extensive
modernization of Turkish armaments in northern Cyprus, which has
been occupied by Turkey since 1974.
</P>
<P>
The essence of the Cyprus problem had nothing to do with one
kind of weapons or the other, it was a problem of invasion and
illegal occupation, Simitis pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders said that Greece and Cyprus fully supported the
efforts of the U.N. Secretary-General to find a solution within
the framework of the Security Council resolutions and the summit
agreements reached by the Greek-Cypriot and Turkish-Cypriot sides
in 1977 and 1979.
</P>
<P>
They urged the international community to continue its efforts
towards a resumption of inter-communal dialogue on the divided
island and the commencement of a dialogue on reducing arms and the
island's demilitarization.
</P>
<P>
Both men said that the two countries would not have any
objection in principle to a guaranteed military flight prohibition
zone over Cyprus, provided this was within the U.N. framework and
was part of a procedure which would lead to gradual disarmament.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- China "supports in
principle" the U.N. Security Council's adoption of a draft
resolution, but still "has concerns over some wording" in the
resolution, offered by America and Britain, a Chinese diplomat
said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Ranfeng, spokesman for the Chinese U.N. mission, told
Xinhua that "we support in principle the adoption of the draft
resolution, but we still have concerns over some wording" in the
draft.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, "we want the present draft resolution to be improved

<P>

consultations on the draft resolution, which is expected to
endorse a U.S.-UK plan to try the two suspected Libyans of the
Lockerbie bombing in the Netherlands, sources here said.
</P>
<P>
China has some reservations on some wording in the eighth
paragraph of the draft resolution, which said that the Security
Council would "consider additional measures if the two accused
have not arrived or appeared for trial promptly," said the
spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Rebuts Handover Rumors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 27 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
Thursday dismissed speculations that he might not serve a full
four-year term if he is re-elected in the September general
elections.
</P>
<P>
"I'm running for four years," Kohl told reporters in Berlin,
adding that "If I says I'll do something, I'll do it."
</P>
<P>
Kohl, 68, has been German chancellor since 1982. He is running
for an unprecedented fifth term against the chancellor candidate
of the main opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD), Gerhard
Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
The latest speculations about Kohl's early retirement was
triggered by his designated successor, Wolfgang Schaeuble, who
told the German weekly Die Woche that the chancellor was running
for a full term but did not completely rule out handing over power
before 2002.
</P>
<P>
Kohl formally named Schaeuble, the 55-year-old parliamentary
leader of his Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party, as his
designated successor in October last year, but he never specified
when the handover should take place.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday Kohl stressed he could fully imagine that
Schaeuble would become CDU's chancellor candidate in the 2002
general elections.
</P>
<P>
However, as the 1998 election day is approaching, Kohl is still
fighting an uphill battle against Schroeder whom he is trailing
between three to six percentage points in opinion polls.

<HEADLINE> Tel Aviv Bombing Injures 21, Leaders Condemn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A total of 21 people were
injured in the explosion in Tel Aviv on Thursday morning, while
both Israeli and Palestinian leaders condemned the bombing attack.
</P>
<P>
The bomb hid in a garbage can went off at an intersection of
the bustling Allenby Street and Rothschild Boulevard. A pregnant
woman and two children were among the injured, one of whom is in
serious condition.
</P>
<P>
The injured have been rushed to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The explosion erupted during the morning rush hour but it was
lucky that a city public bus carrying passengers just left the
scene before the explosion went off, otherwise, the explosion
could cause more injuries or damage, Israeli police said.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the bombing, but the
police suspected it to be a terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who went to Tel Aviv
in the afternoon to see the injured in hospitals, said the
explosion showed the terrorists were acting against Israeli
civilians not only in the West Bank city of Hebron but anywhere.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a Jewish settler was stabbed to death by a
Palestinian in Hebron. Israel has complained that Palestinian
National Authority President Yasser Arafat did not condemn it.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu again urged the Palestinian side to take measures to
fight against all kinds of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"This attack is another sign that we need to fight terror," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat condemned Thursday's explosion.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting in the West Bank city of Ramallah with
Israeli Labor Knesset (parliament) member Saleh Tarif, Arafat said
the Palestinians condemn any kind of terrorist attacks,
particularly these acts against innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
Many other people suffered from minor burns to only shock in
the explosion. Tel Aviv police sealed off the area to conduct
investigation immediately after the blast. They found that the
bomb, weighing about one to two pounds, was packed with nails.
</P>
<P>
Police said they will mobilize more personnel to investigate
the incident and vowed to bring the criminals to justice as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
Tel Aviv has been a frequent target for Palestinian militants,
led by the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), who have been
launching a terror campaign through bombing buses and public
places in order to wreck the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces have been put on high alert in the past
days following the U.S. missile attacks against suspected Islamic
terrorist-related sites in Sudan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Anti-U.S. Islamic activists have warned to launch retaliatory
attacks against American and Israeli targets.
</P>
<P>
Israel is expected to take advantage of the explosion to
pressure the PNA to crack down tougher on militants. David Bar
Illan, Netanyahu's media adviser, said Thursday that the peace
process cannot continue unless Israeli security is secured.

Los Angeles, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A new survey by Nielsen
Media this week shows that more people in the United States and
Canada are online and doing their shopping there.
</P>
<P>
The number of Internet users older than 16 in the two countries
reached 79 million as of June, according to the study. That's 36
percent increase over last year, when a survey showed 58 million
users online.
</P>
<P>
Of the 79 million Net users, Nielsen said, 20 million are
buying products and services online. And the number of Web
shoppers -- people checking out or comparing products and services
on the Web -- is now 48 million.
</P>
<P>
"The Internet continues its impressive growth as a
communications, research, entertainment and commercial medium,"
said Jerome Samson, director of technology and business strategy
at Nielsen in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Based on the statistics, he said, the number of Internet users
grew at a rate of 2.5 percent a month from January 1997 through
June this year. When it came to e-commerce, the numbers grew at
3.5 percent a month from January 1997 through September 1997. And
from September through June this year, the growth in online buyers
accelerated 8 percent a month.
</P>
<P>
"The dramatic increase in online purchasing is primarily due to
people realizing how quick and easy it is to shop on the Web,"
Samson said.

PYONGYANG, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The government of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) has deported an

Lee's activities seriously violated the DPRK's sovereignty and

<HEADLINE> German Machinery Exports Hit by Steep Drop in New Orders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The German machine-building
industry suffered a 15 percent steep drop in foreign orders in
July mainly due to the Asian financial crisis and declining
investments in Latin America, the industry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the German machine-building industry association
VDMA in Frankfurt, the sharp drop in foreign orders wiped out a
six percent gain in domestic orders, so that the industry saw an
overall drop of seven percent in new orders in July.
</P>
<P>
A positive development came only from Western Europe where
orders for German investment goods increased by seven percent in
July over the same month of last year, the VDMA said.
</P>
<P>
The association, however, also expressed the belief that the
steep drop in foreign orders in July was partly exaggerated by the
extraordinarily high order volume registered in July last year.
</P>
<P>
For the period from May to July, the German machine-building
industry only received two percent less foreign orders than the
same period of last year, the VDMA said.

<HEADLINE> War Not Likely Between Greece and Turkey, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Deputy Foreign Minister
of Sweden Pierre Schori Friday ruled out the possibility of a war
between Greece and Turkey, saying that only crazy people would
contemplate something of the sort.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in the northern Greek city of
Thessaloniki, Schori said that there was a problem of dialogue
between the two countries, but this was not a new problem and a
war between the two neighbors was impossible, the Macedonian Press
Agency (MPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
As for the Kosovo crisis, he said that Sweden backed an
increased autonomy within the framework of the Yugoslav
Federation.
</P>
<P>
He called on Belgrade to stop its military actions in Kosovo
while pointing out that the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) would not
win their armed struggle in seeking independence from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the spread of the Asian and Russian economic
crisis to the European Union (EU), the minister stressed that the
European countries were not in any danger as in view of the
economic and monetary union their economies fulfill strict terms
allowing them to cope with international competition.
</P>
<P>
Schori is in Thessaloniki as part of the Swedish Social
Democrat Party's election campaign because some 20,000 Swedes are
now living in Greece with the right to vote in the Swedish
elections.

<HEADLINE> China Resumes Ambitious Tibetan Railway Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, August 28 (Xinhua) -- China has re-started an
ambitious plan to build the first railway in the Tibet Autonomous
Region, which was abandoned a decade ago, according to Legqog,
Chairman of the Regional People's Government.
</P>
<P>
Legqog, who has been in Guiyang, the capital of Guizhou
Province, for a regional economic coordination forum for 6
southwestern provinces and autonomous regions and Chongqing
Municipality, said that leaders at the meeting have asked the
central government for an early start on the project.
</P>
<P>
Tibet is the only provincial-level administrative region that
has no railway. Since the 1950s, Chinese engineers have been
planning and studying its prospects, and have proposed 4 routes
from Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan, and Yunnan provinces.
</P>
<P>
One of them, from Qinghai to Tibet, was even started in the
1970s, but it came to a halt in the '80s, when it proved too
difficult and costly to complete, after the section from Xining,
the capital, to Golmud was finished in 1984.
</P>
<P>
This year, the central government's decision to increase
spending has rekindled Tibetans' hope for having their own
railway, Legqog said. Over the next 5 years, 70 billion yuan will
be spent on railways in the southwestern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Railway Ministry's No.1 Exploration and Design Institute
has completed a feasibility study on the 1,100-kilometer-long
section from Golmud to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, which will
cost 13.9 billion yuan. They are expected to conduct a feasibility
study on a second option from Dali in Yunnan Province to Lhasa,
which is 710 kilometers long and is expected to cost 63.5 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The second route will put Tibet closer to the sea than the
first, and can link the Tibetan railway with two proposed railways
from China to Thailand and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Hua Maokun, the Ministry's engineer-in-chief, is cautious about
the project and says that it needs to be carefully studied and
that people should be patient and not in a hurry.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Friday:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Pressure mounted on Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin to
cede some of his powers or step aside as Russia's political
leaders frantically negotiated over fundamental changes in the
country's economic policies.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Federal authorities brought a suspect in the embassy
bombings in Africa to the United States, saying he had admitted
that he was trained at terrorist camps in Afghanistan by Osama bin
Laden.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Full-scale warfare erupted in Kinshasa, Congo's capital
Thursday as Rwandan-backed rebels fought government troops and
their allies in several neighborhoods near the city center.
</P>
<P>
-- Bad economic news ricocheted around the globe Thursday, from
Japan to Russia to Europe and then to Latin America, finally
exploding in U.S. stock markets and sending the Dow Jones
industrial average plunging more than 350 points to close at
8165.99. The 4.2 percent drop was the largest since October's dive
of 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:

<HEADLINE> Libya Sees Offer Acceptance as "Serious Position" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
United Nations, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Libya late on Thursday
voiced its acceptance to the American-British offer to try the two
suspected Libyans in the Netherlands, saying that it is hoped that
other parties concerned would be serious in its position.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Abuzed Dorda, Libyan permanent
representative to the United Nations, took the floor Thursday
night before the U.N. Security voted 15-0 to adopt a resolution,
introduced by the U.S. and UK, which endorsed a plan on changing
venue for the Lockerbie trial.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan Government's acceptance "is a serious position, an
irreversible position, " the Libyan envoy said, "We hope the other
parties will likewise be serious in its position."
</P>
<P>
Dorda said that the Libyan Government had the duty and right to
consider the different procedural legal issues pertaining to the
trial. "We are prepared on our part to undertake that
consideration either directly with the judicial authorities of the
states concerned or with the Secretary-General of the United
Nations," he added.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Security Council adopted the resolution one day
after Tripoli announced its acceptance to the American-British
plan to try the two accused in the Netherlands by Scottish judges
under normal Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
However, the just-adopted resolution said that the Security
Council would "consider additional measures" if Libya failed to
promptly hand over the two suspected.
</P>
<P>
The two Libyans were accused of blowing up an American airliner
over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988, which killed a total
of 270 people.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Personal Income Picks Up 0.5 Percent in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Personal income in the United
States picked up 0.5 percent in July, to a seasonally adjusted
7.14 billion dollars, but Americans seem to spend less for the
first time in over two years, the Commerce Department reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wages and salaries, which account for more than half of
Americans' income rose 0.6 percent in July, reflecting continued
low unemployment.
</P>
<P>
But factory wages dropped 0.5 percent and farmers' income fell
5.5 percent, indicating that economic crises in Asia may be
affecting American commerce.
</P>
<P>
However most other income categories, including service and
distributive industry wages, business owners' income, rents and
transfer payments such as Social Security, went up.
</P>
<P>
After-tax personal incomes in June rose by only 0.2 percent,
but consumer spending remained high, rising by 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, personal consumption expenditures fell 0.2
percent, the first decline since June 1996, to a seasonally
adjusted rate of 5.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Those factors pushed the nation's personal savings rate in June
down to a revised 0.1 percent, the lowest since the government
began keeping monthly statistics in 1959.
</P>
<P>
In July, after-tax personal income rose 0.5 percent, the same
increase as the overall income figure. Combined with lower
spending, that brought the savings rate back up to 0.8 percent.

<P>
YANGON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The crew members and 36
passengers on board a missing airliner of state-run Myanmar
Airways, which was found Thursday crashed in a dense forest under
a mountain in Myanmar's eastern Shan state, are all feared dead,
state-owned Radio Myanmar reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar Armed Forces Thursday night discovered the Fokker F-27
aircraft XY-AEN 16 kilometers northeast of Tachilek in the state
bordering Laos and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Rescue work is underway by the Myanmar authorities, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
It added that a special investigation board has been formed to

An earlier official report said that Lao government officials
informed the Myanmar government Thursday that the missing Myanmar
airliner had been found crashed in the Payakha mountain in the
north of Laos.
</P>
<P>
The Fokker aircraft lost its way over Tachilek when it was on a
domestic flight from Yangon to Tachilek Monday morning with 36
local passengers aboard.

ANKARA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi Kurdish faction have
killed 269 of Turkey's Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq over the
past eight months, Turkey's Anatolia News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted a radio report by Iraq's Kurdish Democratic Party
(KDP) as saying that the rebels of the Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK), outlawed in Turkey, were mostly killed during their raids
on villages in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting for independence in southeast Turkey
since 1984, while Turkish troops were trying every way to wipe out
the militants.
</P>
<P>
About 2,500 PKK members have been taking shelters in northern
Iraq since Baghdad was rendered ineffective in controlling the
area in the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The KDP radio said its forces launched counterattacks against
PKK militants who looted villages and killed some of them. It also
said that 20 PKK guerrillas were captured in clashes in August.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the KDP has been cooperating with Turkish troops
and helping them to uproot the PKK, who used northern Iraq as a
springboard for attacks against Turkish targets across the
border.

<HEADLINE> China to Stop Deterioration Of Water Ecology (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- China's State Environmental
Protection Administration said today that China will try to stop
the ecological deterioration in major river and lakes as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
The director of the administration's Nature Protection
Department says that China will monitor construction and
development in resource-rich areas and use legal, administrative,
economical, technical and educational means to prevent further
damage to the ecology.
</P>
<P>
China will clarify developers' ecological protection
responsibilities and that they will have to protect the area they
work in and rehabilitate it. Those who benefit from development
have to pay for restoration.
</P>
<P>
The official said that China will set up a number of reserves
to protect river sources and lakes and wetlands and the government
has decided to increase protection of natural forests which are
already threatened, and ban deforestation in forest and grassland
areas that have good water conservation possibilities.
</P>
<P>
The State Forestry Administration has also said that not a
single natural tree should be chopped down on the upper reaches of
the Yangtze River and that anyone who cuts trees needs to be
punished in accordance with the Forestry Law.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan Province, on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River,
plans to stop deforestation from September 1 and will close all
lumber markets in the province. This means that the Chuanxi Forest
Area, with more than 4.6 million hectares of land, which is one of
the country's three major forest areas, will see no more axes and
saws.

China will no longer consider the interests of tree-cutters
when building hydroelectric power station on the upper reaches of
the Yangtze and will not leave log channels for them.
</P>
<P>
The State Environmental Protection Administration says that all
water conservation projects, and agriculture and forestry
development along China's major rivers must be assessed in
accordance with environmental protection standards, and that no
projects will be allowed if they pose a threat to the environment.
</P>
<P>
Ecological damage has been a source of this year's
floods. Water levels on some sections of the Yangtze and at
Dongting Lake have reached record highs, even though the flow was
below record levels.
</P>
<P>
The State Environmental Protection Administration said in a
report that serious damage to lakes, pools, and wetlands, a
decline in vegetation's ecological function, and the resulting
soil erosion have all contributed to the floods.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Foreign Exchange Demand Increases in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Demand for foreign exchange
increased to 111.89 million U.S. Dollars this week from last
week's 74.27 million Dollars at the autonomous foreign exchange
market in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The This Day newspaper said Friday that this week's high level
of demand had been seen as realistic demand on the part of
foreign exchange users, especially the manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Ade Adefeko, Head of Treasury Department of Fidlity Union
Merchant bank, was quoted as saying that manufacturers are this
time around making effective demand to import some of their
important raw materials for production.
</P>
<P>
A demand analysis showed that foreign exchange demand under
letters of credit stood at some 99.87 million Dollars or 89.25
percent of the total while those made under the invisibles was
12.06 million Dollars or 10.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that the high demand for foreign exchange
reflected investors' confidence in the country's economy due to
the reconciliatory political and economic policies taken recently
by Nigerian Federal Government.
</P>
<P>
In the last four weeks, the exchange rate of the local
currency Naira has been stable, standing at 84 Naira to one
Dollar, and observers here predicted that the rate stability
would continue for a long time.
</P>
<P>
Adefeko noted that most of the leakages in the economy
experienced during the Sani Abacha (the late head of state who
died of heart attack last June) days had been blocked, adding
that this had sanitized the foreign exchange market and hindered
speculative bidding.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Economy Further Slows Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' gross national
product (GNP) grew by a merely 0.6 percent during the first
semester this year, Economic Planning Secretary Felipe Medalla
said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate was the lowest since the fourth quarter of 1992
when production was affected by the Gulf War, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, when compared with other economies also hit by the
Asian financial crisis, the rate was still better, Medalla said,
adding that Malaysia and South Korea posted a negative 7 percent
and 6.6 percent growth respectively during the second quarter
while Indonesian economy is expected to contract by 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months this year, the Philippines' gross
domestic product (GDP) managed to post a positive growth of 0.2
percent with the help of the services sector.
</P>
<P>
The services sector, which comprises 20 percent of the overall
GDP growth, grew by 4.1 percent under the boost of communications,
especially the increase in telephone rates.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture and industry sectors recorded a negative 7.5
percent and zero growth compared with last year's growth of 3.4
percent and 6.3 percent. Agriculture plunged to its 20-year low
because of the El Nino drought.
</P>
<P>
"With this (GNP) growth (of 0.6 percent), the high-end of the
2-3 percent government target is virtually out of reach, but there
is still a chance that we are still within the range," Medalla
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the agriculture sector will perform better in the
second half because rains are expected to come during the period
when farmers will be harvesting their crops.
</P>
<P>
"If that happens, then we can have positive agricultural output
growths in the second semester. In this case, the lower end range
of the target is still feasible," he said.
</P>
<P>
This optimistic view about the economy was shared by central
bank governor Gabriel Singson. He said that with an improvement in
weather conditions and the continued decline in interest rates,
both the agriculture and the manufacturing sectors should perform
better.
</P>
<P>
Singson said the country's monetary policy will remain flexible
to accommodate higher credit growth without upsetting this year's
inflation target of 9.25-9.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We should be able to avoid a recession and maintain a
sustainable growth in 1999," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the Asian financial crisis, the Philippines' GNP
and GDP grew by 2.5 percent and 1.7 percent respectively during
the first quarter this year.

Soldiers who gave their lives in the fight against the floods,
which were the worst since 1954, have been commemorated as
"flood-fighting martyrs" and their families were paid out of the
insurance fund, which came into being on August 1, to compensate
the family of soldiers who are killed or injured in the course of
service.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Parties Ask U.N. to Renew Its Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Two major opposition parties
Friday sent a letter to United Nations Secretary General Kofi
Annan to ask the U.N. to renew its commitment in assessing the
Cambodian elections.
</P>
<P>
The letter signed by Prince Ranariddh, president of Funcinpec,
and Sam Rainsy, president of Sam Rainsy Party (SRP), said they had
filed complaints to the Constitutional Council against the
National Election Committee (NEC) Friday in regard to two
critically important issues.
</P>
<P>
The complaints included the seat allocation formula and the
process that led to it and the NEC's failure to fulfil its duties
of hearing appeals and protests, according to the letter.
</P>
<P>
"We have been beset by pressures to negotiate with the ruling
party and form a coalition government. We feel that it would be
more appropriate that pressure should first be directed at the
ruling party," they added.
</P>
<P>
They asked Annan to help create a multilateral body to examine
the ongoing electoral process and to remain engaged in the
electoral process until a credible result is achieved and a
legitimate government is formed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they demanded the U.N. refrain from making any
further assessment of the electoral process as a whole until it
has reached its conclusion and also to transmit their requests to
other observation bodies so that the international community's
assessment was coordinated.
</P>
<P>
Funcinpec and SRP have been started a massive sit-in protest
across from the National Assembly five days ago against the
election results and demanding the Second Prime Minister step down.
</P>
<P>
The government, however, charged the rally was illegal because
permission had not been sought.

<HEADLINE> Faction Convoy Ambushed in S. Somalia, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Reports from the southern
Somali region of Bay indicate that a convoy of battle wagons were
ambushed Friday near the town of Bur Hakaba, 215 km south of
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the VHF radios, the battle wagons
consisting of four technicals and nearly 50 heavily armed
militiamen of Hussein Aidid's faction were on their way to the
capital from the town of Huddor when they were attacked just
outside Bur Hakaba town at about 10:00 a.m. local time Friday.
</P>
<P>
At least four militiamen were killed and more than three
others wounded during the exchange of the heavy gunfire between
Hussein Aidid's men and those suspected Rahanwein Resistance Army
(RRA) guerrilla fighters.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Hussein Aidid's men said the convoy was
halted after one of the battle wagons ran out of fuel when they
noticed unidentified infantry gunmen surrounding them from all
sides.
</P>
<P>
However, sources said two battle wagons from the ambushed
technicals have managed to arrive in the capital in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The militiamen on board these technicals confirmed the
incident and reported to have seen one of the dead bodies of the
attackers lying by the tarmac roadside just after the shooting
had subsided.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what else they had suffered, but they fled,"
said one of the militiamen.
</P>
<P>
However, unconfirmed reports said one of Hussein Aidid's
battle wagons was seized by the suspected RRA guerrilla fighters
during the exchange of the fire, a claim strongly denied by
Hussein Aidid's side.
</P>
<P>
But Hussein Aidid's men admitted to have lost three of their
gunmen who died on the spot during the ambush, while three others
suffered gunshot wounds. There has been no word as yet from the
RRA nor was there any official comment from Hussein Aidid's side
over the ambush.
</P>
<P>
The regions of Bay and Bakol remained calm these days despite
the continuous occupation by Hussein Aidid's militiamen since
late 1995 when late General Mohamed Farah Aidid invaded those
regions with the aim of wiping out a regional autonomous
administration established for the Rahanwein communities with the
help of UNOSOM (United Nations Operation in Somalia).
</P>
<P>
Hussein Aidid had pledged that he will withdraw his forces
from the two regions ten days prior to the anticipated Baidoa
conference in accordance with the Cairo peace declaration signed
in late last December.

BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese authorities have asked
the 3.75 million civilians and soldiers who are still busy
fighting floods not to relax even though water levels in the
Yangtze and Songhua rivers have been falling.
</P>
<P>
A senior State Flood Control Headquarters official told Xinhua
that this is not the right time to talk about victory because
water levels are fluctuating and dikes are more likely to slide or
collapse during the period of receding waters.
</P>
<P>
And, water levels on some parts of the Yangtze and Songhua have
remained high, he said.

The two months of flooding has exhausted both human and

<HEADLINE> Funcinpec Reaffirms Rejection of Election Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Funcinpec party
said Friday that the National Election Committee (NEC) and
Constitutional Council must resolve all complaints concerning the
general election before it accepted the result and offered to
cooperate.
</P>
<P>
In a four-point statement released Friday, the Funcinpec party,
led by Prince Norodom Ranariddh, said it could not accept the
result because of widespread voting and counting irregularities.
</P>
<P>
According to the official figures, Hun Sen's Cambodian People's
Party (CPP) won 41.4 percent of the vote, while his main
opponents, Funcinpec and the Sam Rainsy Party, received 31.7
percent and 14.3 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
But Funcinpec and the Sam Rainsy Party have rejected the count
since the release of the preliminary result.
</P>
<P>
"The preliminary result of the General Election on July 26
announced by the NEC did not reflect the will of the Cambodian
people," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Funcinpec and other political parties had filed complaints to
the NEC and demanded that the voting and counting irregularities,
and the illegally used formula allocating assembly seats be
properly investigated. However, the NEC had rejected most of the
complaints," said the statement.

<HEADLINE> China's Lawmakers Say No Stricter Adoption Controls For Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- China will not impose more
restrictions on Chinese children adopted by foreigners but will
have more detailed and standardized adoption procedures,
legislators said here today.
</P>
<P>
A draft of the Adoption Law has relaxed restrictions in many
aspects for Chinese and foreigners who apply for adoptions,
according to a member of the National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee, Wan Shaofen, who was debating the draft.
</P>
<P>
In a report submitted to the 4th meeting of the 9th NPC
Standing Committee last Monday, Doje Cering, minister of civil
affairs, said that the draft has stricter requirements on adoption
of Chinese children by foreigners, but Wan pointed out today that
"requirements" means adoption procedures.
</P>
<P>
She said that new procedures could help protect the safety and
interests of children who are up for adoption and prevent
international crimes.
</P>
<P>
One of the members, Chen Junliang, said that adoption
procedures should be simplified with fewer restrictions for
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
From 1992 to 1997, there were 2,403 adoptions in Liaoning
Province, only five of which were by foreigners.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Thwarts Speculative Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong has successfully
repelled international speculators when a two-week government
intervention in the stock market came to a showdown Friday, said a
high-ranking official.
</P>
<P>
The government intervention has pushed the Hang Seng Index up
about 1,200 points over the past two weeks, thwarting the
speculators' plan to profit from a sharp fall in the stock and
futures markets by dumping the Hong Kong dollar.
</P>
<P>
"We have frustrated their plan," Financial Secretary Donald
Tsang told a press conference Friday shortly after the stock
market closed with a record high single-day turnover of nearly 80
billion HK dollars (10 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Instead of benefiting from a collapse of the Hang Seng Index,
the speculators had to settle their short positions in the index
futures ahead of the expire of the August futures contract
Friday, said Tsang.
</P>
<P>
He added that the speculators would also found it expensive to
roll their short positions in the Hang Seng Index futures from
August to September.
</P>
<P>
Though Hong Kong is reluctant in market intervention, Tsang
noted, adding "As a respectable and responsible government, we
must take all the necessary steps to protect the stability and
integrity of our currency and financial markets when they are
under speculative attacks."
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar and the
greenback has been stable for the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said that the government will soon work out follow-up
policy measures to enhance Hong Kong's resilience to speculative
attacks.
</P>
<P>
On the monetary side, Tsang said, the government will make the
currency board system more transparent and open to boost public
confidence, but less susceptible to manipulative play.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government is considering measures to make the
securities and futures markets less vulnerable to manipulative
practices.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive of the Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tung
Chee Hwa said at a separately held press conference here Friday:
"This was an operation thought through in Hong Kong, and decided
in Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
He said the move was necessary to enable Hong Kong to have a
stable interest rate environment for an economic recovery. Hong
Kong economy contracted 5 percent in the second quarter of 1998,
following a negative GDP growth of 2.8 percent in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Tung reaffirmed that the government still stands ready to
intervene whenever there is a clear linkage between speculation on
the currency market, and stock and futures markets.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Budget Revision Rejected by Some Ministries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Spending cuts stipulated in
Romania's 1998 budget revision has been rejected by several
ministries which are set to be hit hardest by the policy.
</P>
<P>
The rejections from the National Education, Health, Culture and
Transport ministries came Friday as the government began debate
over the draft ordinance on budget revision, which will axe funds
for ministries by 8,000 billion lei (about 900 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The figure represented about 10 percent of the current budget
and two percent of the gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
As the spending cuts are the only way to cover part of the
budgetary deficit, all the ministers have formally accepted
it. But the agreement of principle over this measure was not
automatically accepted by the government members.
</P>
<P>
National Education Minister Andrei Marga said his ministry's
cuts of 1,000 billion lei (112 million dollars) "are absolutely
unacceptable and will have serious consequences on education".
</P>
<P>
Marga said that his ministry needed another 800 billion lei (90
million dollars) this year and could not accept any reduction.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Hajdu Gabor said the cuts of 100 billion lei
(11 million dollars) would be extremely painful for his ministry.
He specified measures such as cancelling investment, cutting
hospital spending and not filling vacancies.
</P>
<P>
Culture Minister Ion Caramitru showed no enthusiasm on his
ministry's budget revision, where spending will drop 74 billion
lei (8.3 million dollars), affecting investments.
</P>
<P>
National Defense Minister Victor Babiuc was also unhappy, for
his ministry will lose at least four percent of the given budget.
</P>
<P>
But the budget revision, proposed by Minister of Finance Daniel
Daianu, won the backing of Prime Minister Radu Vasile, who said,
"There is no other better solution and an increase in the budget
deficit cannot be accepted."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Daianu justified the revision, claiming there could
be a risk of the budget deficit jumping over 5.5 percent from the
initial target of 3.6 percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the government said no decision had been made till
now over the issue and the draft ordinance would be discussed
during an extraordinary government session on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian government has pressed ahead with unpopular
austerity policies aimed at overhauling the troubled economy which
witnessed a surge in inflation from 57 percent in 1996 to over 100
percent last year.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Still Easing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The continuing weakening of the
Australian dollar has failed to stop an easing in wool prices this
week, the Australian Council of Wool Exporters (ACWE) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the Australian dollar falling to an all-time low
against the U.S. dollar during the course of this week, this did
not have any positive effect on wool prices in Australian currency
terms," ACWE said in its weekly report.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, this further lowering of the spot cost of Australian
wool to our overseas customers will only increase the risk of
earlier contracts being dishonored."
</P>
<P>
ACWE said prices eased marginally at sales in Newcastle and
Fremantle.
</P>
<P>
"The eastern indicator fell three cents to 563 cents clean
based essentially on a drop of eight cents in the north, as in the
west there was no change in the regional indicator."
</P>
<P>
"Consequently the northern and western regional indicators
finished the week at 568 and 519 cents per kilogram clean
respectively."
</P>
<P>
With no sale in the south, the regional indicator remained at
557 cents per kilogram clean.
</P>
<P>
ACWE noted that the smaller offering of 52,938 bales had failed
to hold the market steady.
</P>
<P>
"The continuing uncertainty over the stockpile decision is not
helping the situation and the worsening economic outlook in Asia
and other countries is impeding trade confidence."
</P>
<P>
If parliament did not meet next week to impose a legislative
freeze on the wool stockpile from October, then the principle area
of speculation would be what action Wool International would take
about its commitment to selling 90,000 bales in the December
quarter.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Say Peking Man Had Fire (1) by Yu Zheng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese paleoanthropologists and
archaeologists say that ash and charcoal remains found in a cave
near Beijing prove that Peking Man was the first to use fire.
</P>
<P>
No place in the world can compare with Zhoukoudian (the site
where Peking Man was discovered) for evidence of the controlled
use of fire, according to Zhang Senshui, a research fellow with
the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Vertebrate
Paleontology and Paleoanthropology.
</P>
<P>
Since the late 1920s, archaeologists have found hominid
fossils and primitive tools from as far back as 500,000 to 200,000
years ago at Zhoukoudian, in Beijing's southwestern suburbs.
</P>
<P>
Burnt animal bones and charcoal remains found in the cave there
in the 1930s caused people to believe that Peking Man might be the
earliest ancestor of fire users.
</P>
<P>
But, some researchers were suspicious of this and suggested
that water might have carried the charred bones and ash into the
cave over time.

<P>
Steve Weiner of Israel's Weizmann Institute of Science, who
was involved in 5 studies between 1994 and 1997 at Zhoukoudian,
wrote in the journal Science that no ash or charcoal remains could
be detected, so, although indirect evidence of burning is present,
there is no direct evidence.
</P>
<P>
But, Wu Xinzhi, a paleoanthropologist who works with Zhang,
says that Weiner and the other four researchers only examined some
sediment from the western section of Site 1 and that they did not
have enough evidence to support the claim that most of the
fine-grain sediment at the site came in with water laid, and that
even if ash remains could be recognized, it would be difficult to
demonstrate where they were produced.
</P>
<P>
Guo Shilun, a research fellow of the Atomic Energy Institute,
says that in the 1970s they examined samples from the cave using
fission track dating and concluded that they were the same age as
the sediment. If the ash was from burning, the rock inside the
cave would show a much older age.
</P>
<P>
The use of fire offered early ancestors protection against
large beasts, provided warmth, nutrition and light at night, and
experiments have shown that rocks and lithological units outside
the cave are at least 100 million years old.

Running water might affect the aggregation in the cave in some
way because it was not enclosed so much, Zhang, who is a
specialist in Paleolithic artifacts, says, and the hearth was very
difficult to keep intact.
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt about Peking Man's ability to use fire," says
Jia Lanpo, of CAS, who unearthed parts of Peking Man in the
1930s. He says he found charcoal grains in Layer 10 and even a
piece of charred Chinese redbud in the quartzite layer, about 10
centimeters long and thicker than his thumb.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhoukoudian's geology, the ash layer might be thin
or thick and there might be more than one, says Liu Dongsheng,
also of CAS's Geology Institute, and even forest fires can leave a
thin layer of black grains in loess.
</P>
<P>
The bones of tiny fauna might be moved by water, but water
could hardly wash heavy stone artifacts into the cave, Zhang adds,
and a heavy stone tool excavated from Layer 4 was obviously
burnt. The occurrence of ash, burnt bones, stone artifacts and
hominid fossils in the same layers prove cultural association, he
says.
</P>
<P>
The Peking Man site at Zhoukoudian is on UNESCO's World
Heritage list.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislators Say Cause Of Floods Should Be Made Clear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Some Chinese legislators view
the nation-wide fight against floods with mixed feelings and say
that the causes of the disaster need to be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
At the 4th meeting of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress here today, 7 legislators said that more
attention should be paid to water conservation and environmental
deterioration, which are believed to be one of the major causes of
this year's flooding.
</P>
<P>
They said that from 1996 to 2000, about 300 billion yuan is
expected to be put into water conservation projects.
</P>
<P>
The destructive floods were caused by the excessive cutting of
trees on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The widespread
deforestation caused serious soil erosion on 570,000 square
kilometers of land.
</P>
<P>
Yao Zhengyan, a former vice minister of Water Resources, says
that China has built more than 80,000 reservoirs since 1949, and
that rivers with water conservation projects were in better
condition than those without. He said the central government needs
to put more money into water conservation projects and
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Wan Shaofen says that the most important thing is to ensure a
basic living standard of people in the flood hit areas, and
control disease and provide help for students in those areas.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea to Suspend Credit to Subsidiaries of Five Conglomerates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government Friday
announced the suspension of credit to weak and nonviable
subsidiaries of the nation's five biggest conglomerates from next
month.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the National Assembly on Thursday, Lee
Hun-jai, chairman of the Financial Supervisory Commission, said
any subsidiaries of Hyundai, Daewoo, Samsung, LG and SK, which had
lost competitiveness would be subjected to the credit suspension.
</P>
<P>
The suspension measures included the halting of new loans,
refusal to extend maturing loans and withdrawal of existing loans,
Lee added.
</P>
<P>
The survival of the South Korean economy largely depends on the
competitive strength of the five family-owned conglomerates and
they should give up all nonviable and unprofitable businesses,
said government officials.
</P>
<P>
However, the five industrial giants said recently they had to
tackle many other issues, including strikes and layoffs.
</P>
<P>
South Korean conglomerates have been blamed for devouring bank
loans and shirking responsibility for producing the current
financial crisis with their high debts.
</P>
<P>
The subsidiaries of the nation's top 30 conglomerates were
laden with total debts of 28 billion U.S. dollars, which was 4.5
times more than their capital at the end of 1997 when the nation
signed an agreement with the International Monetary Fund for a
rescue loan of 58 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, South Korea has to restructure its economy
and open its markets this year.

Standing Committee, China's top legislature, is expected to vote
on a draft of a higher education law and amendments to the land

Council bill on 100 billion yuan in treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
The Committee heard proposed changes in the two laws and a
report from the NPC's Financial and Economic Committee.
</P>
<P>
A suggestion of legislators that Party committees are leaders
of universities, but should not handle all work, like that of
university presidents and that they should support those
presidents in their duties in a responsible and independent way
was added and the duties of Party committees and university
presidents was clarified in the draft.
</P>
<P>
They also said that misuse of land and deforestation are part
of the reason for the devestating floods on the Yangtze River and
suggested a new draft of the land management law prohibiting
wasteland caused by deforestation, filling and leveling of lakes
and cultivating rivers.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Financial and Economic Committee suggested that the
legislature approve a State Council bill on 100 billion yuan worth
of treasury bonds, calling it feasible because of deflation and
too much currency having been taken out of circulation.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Religious Leader Says Door To China Should Remain Open (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Pat Robertson, chairman of the
board of the U.S.'s Christian Broadcasting Network and founder of
the American Center of Law and Justice, told Xinhua in an
interview today that Sino-U.S. relations have entered a new era of
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Robertson was concluding his fourth visit to China today. On
Wednesday, he met with Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji at Zhongnanhai,
the Chinese government compound for over an hour.
</P>
<P>
The 68-year-old Robertson was born in Lexington, Virginia, and
is a descendant of Benjamin Harrison, one of the signers of the
Declaration of Independence, and of two former U.S. Presidents.
</P>
<P>
When Robertson first visited China in 1979, he found a
"backward" nation that he said was "best characterized by masses
of somber people dressed in drab gray Mao jackets riding silently
on thousands of cheap, mass-produced bicycles."
</P>
<P>
He says that he learned then that the Chinese government owned
every means of production and distribution down to the smallest
kiosk and that the only free enterprises were those with
home-grown vegetables. A factory worker earned the equivalent of
28 U.S. dollars a month. The manager of a factory employing 2,000
people earned no more than 70 or 80 dollars per month, he
recalls.

<P>
On subsequent visits, after the economic reforms begun by Deng
Xiaoping, however, Robertson found "something extraordinary", and
that China had become a "beehive" of commercial activity, with 220
million television sets, fiber optic television cables, cellular
phones, shops full of Western consumer goods, ultra-modern hotels
and office buildings, a fledgling stock exchange, roads with sleek
automobiles, construction projects going twenty-four hours a day,
seven days a week, and the largest McDonald's in the world. What
he saw was an emerging industrial giant.
</P>
<P>
Robertson said that he is very happy to see a new era of warm
cooperation taking place between the United States and China and
that he recently wrote an article for the Wall Street Journal
titled "Keep The Door To China Open", in which he said that
isolating China and hoping that China would never become a
super-power is like hiding under the covers and hoping that the
sun does not rise in the morning.
</P>
<P>
There is no question that Chinese society is a great deal more
open, he said, when asked about the progress China has made in the
past two decades,
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the live TV coverage of a debate between
President Jiang Zemin and visiting President Bill Clinton as a
historic event signifying great social progress and a great
movement toward freedom.

<HEADLINE> Asian Games Attract Enough Sponsors: Organizers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Games to be held in
December has attracted enough sponsorship to finance the event,
organizers said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Asian Games Organising Committee Financial
Director Santipab Thejavanijaya said: "The marketing promotion

<HEADLINE> Chinese President on Diplomatic Work (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that China will make efforts to create a better
international environment favorable to the realization of the
country's goals in its socialist moderization drive.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks while addressing China's envoys at a
national meeting on diplomatic work.
</P>
<P>
To that end, Jiang said, China will implement the
diplomatic ideas of late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping,
unswervingly adhere to an independent foreign policy of peace,
and implement the principles set forth by the 15th Congress of
the Communist Party of China, thus bringing the country's diplomatic
work into the next century.
</P>
<P>
Other Chinese leaders including Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, Li
Ruihuan, Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing and Li Lanqing, all members of
the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central
Committee, also met with delegates attending the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he considered this meeting, held on the eve of the
new century, important for China's diplomatic work. "After the
previous envoy meeting held in 1993, China's diplomacy scored new
achievements," he said, adding that those efforts helped keep a
good neighborly and international environment for the country.
</P>
<P>
In his address, the president summed up achievements including
the improvement of relationships with all major countries; the
important turnaround in Sino-U.S.ties; enhanced solidarity and
cooperation between China and other developing countries; the
successful resumption of the exercise of China's sovereignty over
Hong Kong; the improvement of the situation across the Taiwan
Straits, and ongoing multi-lateral diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
"China's international position has been upgraded, with greater
influence in international affairs," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang attributed this progress to adherence to the diplomatic
thoughts of late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. "Applying the
viewpoints of dialectic and historical materialism, Deng calmly
observed the drastic changes in the international arena and made a
series of scientific conclusions and decisions based on his
objective analysis of the development trends and characteristics
of the contemporary world and the world situation," Jiang pointed
out.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Propose Int'l Conference on Monetary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will table a proposal
calling on the international society to hold an international
conference on monetary and financial concerns, Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
This proposal has been made sometime ago but developed nations
refused to hold such a conference because they thought the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are already there,
said the minister when talking about the forthcoming Non-Aligned
Movement (NAM) Summit to be held in Durban, South Africa from
August 29 to September 3.
</P>
<P>
Given the fact that the monetary crisis continues to plague
East and Southeast Asia, Indonesia considers that such a
conference is important, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the field of politics, he said, Indonesia will also propose
to the Movement the formation of a special mission to countries
sponsoring the Middle East peace process, like the United States
and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The special mission needs to meet with Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said that the NAM needs to play a more active role in
the Middle East, particularly in settling the problems related to
Israel's move to continue the development of human settlements in
areas it is occupies.
</P>
<P>
Alatas, who was appointed to lead the Indonesian delegation to
the NAM summit, said President B.J. Habibie will not be able to
attend the summit because of the vacancy in the post of vice
president who should take over his state duties.

<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang pointed to Deng Xiaoping's ideas on diplomacy as a guide
to long-term diplomacy in China, and said that an in-depth study
of Deng's ideas accords with global changes and whether China can
succeed in teamwork in diplomacy depends on it.
</P>
<P>
Deng was not only a great statesman and strategist, but also a
outstanding diplomat with good diplomatic ideas and artistry and
a distinctive style, he said.
</P>
<P>
Deng's ideas are an important part of Deng Xiaoping Theory,
which is a combination of Marxism-Leninism and Chinese diplomatic
practices and a development of Mao Zedong Thought in a new
historical period, Jiang explained.
</P>
<P>
He said the world is heading toward multi-polarization now that
the Cold War has ended, and international tensions have gradually
eased, with significant changes in international relations and
progress.
</P>
<P>
This trend helps to limit hegemony and power politics and is
conducive to a new international political and economic order with
justice and fairness, and brings a peaceful, stable and prosperous
world into the new century. But, he said, there will be a
considerably long period of evolution before a new global pattern
is formed eventually.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jiang also pointed out that the economic
globalization is arousing wide attention. Economic globalization,
is an objective and irreversible trend in the development of
the world economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
In today's world, no one country developing economically can
cut itself off from the rest of the world, he said, noting: "We
need to continue the opening-up policy and adapt ourselves to
economic globalization."
</P>
<P>
He asked everyone to participate in international economic
cooperation and competition and to make full use of opportunities
and challenges that come with globalization, while keeping alert
to the risks brought by globalization, and to work independently
and minimize risks to maintain economic safety and better develop
the country.

<P>
Jiang stressed that in terms of the global situation at the
turn of the century, there are generally more opportunities and
hopes than challenges and difficulties, and more favorable factors
than unfavorable ones.
</P>
<P>
"We must have a clear understanding of the main stream of
development, seize opportunities, and strive for a more positive
and favorable position for our nation in the international
competition of the 21st century," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that the primary task for China's diplomatic
work is to create a peaceful environment for the country's
socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
China's reform, opening-up and modernization drive need a
domestic political situation of stability and unity, as well
as a peaceful international environment, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence,
China should properly handle relations with other major nations to
promote global multi-polarization, he noted.
</P>
<P>
China should adhere to the principle of seeking friendly
relationship with all neighboring nations, and properly handle
relations with them, the leader said.
</P>
<P>
He added that China will further strengthen solidarity and
cooperation with all other developing countries, and make
concerted efforts with them to safeguard the rights and interests
of all developing countries.
</P>
<P>
China will actively participate in multi-lateral diplomatic
activities, firmly safeguard its own sovereignty, territorial
integrity and national dignity, and work hard to advance the great
cause of the reunification of the motherland, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that China must take a clear-cut stand,
always uphold principles, work effectively and wage necessary
struggles when dealing with issues related to state sovereignty,
national security and fundamental interests, to the rights and
interests of developing countries, to world peace and regional
stability, and to the establishment of a new global political and
economic order that is just, fair and rational.

Jiang pointed out that new situations and tasks make higher
demands on China's diplomatic work and the building of the
diplomatic ranks.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes people working in the diplomatic field stick to
the ideology of "emancipating the mind, and seeking truth from
facts," and bear Deng Xiaoping Theory, especially his
diplomatic thoughts, in mind.
</P>
<P>
He further hopes they will learn to acquire a correct
understanding of the international situation by observing and
analyzing it with the Marxist stand, method and viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
He said that people in the diplomatic field should
maintain a firm political belief and stance, foster keen
political insight and judgement, and observe and
analyze the world situation from an overall political view.
</P>
<P>
"You must implement the principles and policies of the Central
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party conscientiously and
creatively," Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
"You must inherit and carry forward the fine style and
tradition of diplomatic work advocated by Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai
and Deng Xiaoping," he added.
</P>
<P>
"You must firmly establish a correct view of the world, life
and values, and stand the tests of various international
environments and turmoils," he continued.
</P>
<P>
Leaders at all levels should place emphasis on the building of
diplomatic contingents, and put the cultivation of young people in
an important position in order to have more people demonstrate
their talents and guarantee a powerful organization for the new
phase of our diplomatic work, Jiang noted.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Australian shares dived almost
100 points at the opening Friday before a surging AMP and slight
rally by the local dollar clawed back the stock market's loses to
1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark all ordinaries index finished 43.7 points down at
2,516.9 points after falling to 2,461.3 points in early trade with
plunging overseas markets buffeting the local bourse.
</P>
<P>
"If it wasn't for AMP, the market would be further down than it
is," said Morgan Stockbroking client adviser Kim Ferrier, "the
Australian dollar and AMP saved the day."
</P>
<P>
Still, the all ordinaries closed at its lowest level since
December 12 last year.
</P>
<P>
More than 7.34 million AMP shares were traded, with fund
managers buying up the stock before its listing on the Morgan
Stanley Capital Index next week.

<P>
On the local equities markets, the all industrials index closed
66.6 points lower at 4,471.8 points, while the all resources index
dropped 27.2 points to 930.8 points.

<P>
Against the negative market sentiment, Telstra rose five,
topping the turnover table with 70.3 million installment receipts
traded.
</P>
<P>
The "big four" banks all lost ground, with the industry index
plunging 130 points to 5,584.6 points.
</P>
<P>
National Australia Bank shed 65 cents, ANZ dropped 33, Westpac
slid 25 and the Commonwealth surrendered 14.7.

<HEADLINE> Bank of China Launches Investment Banking Arm in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Bank of China (BOC) launched
its investment banking arm, the new BOC International Holdings
Ltd. here Friday to streamline the bank's overseas investment
banking businesses.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters of BOC International, previously based in
London, moved to the Special Administrative Region after more than
half year's ground work, winding up BOC's re-grouping of all its
overseas investment banking operations, Vice Chairman of BOC
International Liu Jinbao told a press conference Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Before BOC International's restructuring, BOC, a leading
state-owned commercial bank in China, had already been involved in
investment banking activities in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Now, under the new BOC International's umbrella, there are nine
subsidiaries offering all-round investment banking services
including securities business, asset management, project finance
and direct investment, said Liu, who is also general manager of
BOC Hong Kong Branch.
</P>
<P>
Liu pledged that BOC International will continue to provide
services to China's state-owned enterprises by facilitating their
restructuring of assets and debts, and guiding them to
international capital market.
</P>
<P>
BOC International aims to "grow into one of the first-class
investment banks in the region in the next three to five years,"
the banker said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the opening of BOC International demonstrated its
confidence in Hong Kong's future while constituting an actual
support for Hong Kong's position as an international financial
center.

<HEADLINE> Falling Dollar Not All Bad News: Economists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The suffering Australian dollar
has the potential to fall even further but the tumble is not
necessarily a disaster for the Australian economy, economists said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this week the local currency has fallen
almost three U.S. cents and dropped through its record post-float
low to create a new all-time low of 55.30 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Associated Press quoted ANZ Banking group chief
economist Saul Eslake as saying that if commodity prices continued
to decline, by another 10 percent for example, the Australian
dollar could sink to anywhere between 54.00 and 52.00 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
But many market participants have commented on the difficulty
on picking a base for the fall of the domestic dollar, simply due
to the fact the currency has not traded in this region before.
</P>
<P>
Before this week the Australian dollar had only traded as low
as 57.10 U.S. cents, which was reached on July 28, 1986.
</P>
<P>
While commenting about the falling dollar, AAP Financial
Markets economist Gary Shilson-Josling said, the Australian dollar
could travel lower from here but market consensus is that it was
undervalued at present levels.
</P>
<P>
"Most people would see the Australian dollar's fair value as
somewhere closer to 60.00 U.S. cents than 55.00," Shilson-Josling
said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the overwhelming bearish sentiment on the Australian
dollar economists have been at pains to point out that the fall is
not all bad news for the Australian economy.
</P>
<P>
"If it (the fall) were to become a disorderly rout then it
obviously would be bad news," he said, but at the moment the
tumble is bad news only for people who are planning overseas
holidays or trying to sell imported goods to Australian consumers.
</P>
<P>
The level of the Australian dollar is good for Australia's
exporters, farmers, miners and most of our manufacturers and
therefore for employment.
</P>
<P>
If the Australian dollar fell in such a way or to the point
where the Reserve Bank of Australia felt necessary to raise
interest rates only then would it become a risk to the economy.
</P>
<P>
Many of the economists here believed that it would be unlikely
that the Reserve Bank of Australia would raise official interest
rates to support the currency in the near future.

<P>
KUNMING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Devastating disasters, including
floods, mudflows, landslides and hail, have killed some 477
people in southwestern China's Yunnan Province since the beginning
of this year.
</P>
<P>
Gao Zuxing, director of the Yunnan Provincial Civil Affair
Administration, said today that disasters have also injured over
7,000 people and destroyed well over 700,000 houses.
</P>
<P>
He added that disasters have adversely affected over 14 million
people, and have resulted in economic losses of some 5.8 billion
yuan (700 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Gao pointed out the disasters have caused varying levels of
death and damage in 125 of the province's 128 counties.
</P>
<P>
The province has provided adequate shelter, food and medical
treatment for over four million disaster victims. Over four
million soldiers and Yunnan citizens have participated in disaster
relief efforts, with the central government providing some 300
million yuan (36 million dollars) in assistance.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists say some parts of Yunnan face the continuing
possibility of similar disasters in the remaining months of this

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A tripartite commission of the
Russian government and legislature has drafted an agreement to
urge President Boris Yeltsin to surrender some powers to the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The commission, composed of representatives of the government
and both chambers of parliament, also formed a pact on social and
economic policy.
</P>
<P>
Both accords will be presented to the lower house on Friday for
approval, commission coordinator Oleg Morozov said on Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to curb the worsening financial situation, Yeltsin
reappointed Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime minister over the weekend
to replace the young Sergei Kiriyenko, who succeeded Chernomyrdin
only five months ago with the support of Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
After the announcement of Chernomyrdin's appointment, the
Communists, who hold a majority in the State Duma (lower house),
demanded more power as a condition for approving the new
appointment.
</P>
<P>
The drafting of the two documents by the commission is a key
step in the State Duma's approval of Chernomyrdin's appointment.

<HEADLINE> Clashes Erupt in Hebron as Israel Lifts Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Clashes erupted Friday in the
volatile West Bank city of Hebron between local Palestinians and
Israeli soldiers. Two palestinians were reportedly injured.
</P>
<P>
The clashes occurred shortly after Israeli troops lifted the
week-long military closure on Hebron Friday morning, prompting
hundreds of Palestinian residents to take to the streets to
demonstrate against the closure.
</P>
<P>
A local Palestinian reporter told Xinhua the Palestinian police
tried in vain to control the protesters, who threw stones at
Israeli soldiers guarding the enclaves where Jewish settlers are
living.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers responded with rubber bullets and tear gas.
</P>
<P>
Israel lifted the closure to allow local Palestinians to buy
food and water, but the curfew imposed around the areas where
Jewish settlers are living remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Israel imposed closure on Hebron eight days ago following the
killing of 63-year-old Jewish settler rabbi Shlomo Ra'anan by
suspected Palestinian militants at his home in Tel Rumeida
neighborhood in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
While Israel is only controlling 20 percent of the divided city,
it can impose total closure on the whole city for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
The week-long blockade caused great hardship to the local
Palestinians, who suffered from acute shortage of water and food
due to ban on free travel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side estimated that the financial losses of the
closure were about 21 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy Pledges to Devote to Angolan Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The new special representative
of the United Nations to Angola, Issa Diallo, said here Friday
that he will devote himself to the peace process in the
war-ravaged country despite all difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Diallo who arrived in Luanda early Friday morning said that he
will devote his "body and soul" to help the Angolan people fully
carry out the 1994 Lusaka Peace accords.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy noted in a statement at the airport that the
faltering Angolan peace process is undergoing the most serious
crisis in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
But Diallo said he believes that the Angolan people will
cherish the hard-won peace and concentrate on the economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The 59-year-old new U.N. envoy also extended his thanks to
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his trust.
</P>
<P>
Annan appointed Diallo as the new U.N. envoy to Angola after
Alioune Beye, the late U.N. special representative and Malian
foreign minister died on June 26 when his plane crashed in Cote
d'Ivoire. The investigation of the incident is still going on.
</P>
<P>
Diallo, born in Conakry, capital of Guinea in 1939, was a
graduate from the Department of International Relations and
Political Science in Paris University. He earned his doctorate
degree at the Institute of Advanced International Studies in the
University of Geneva.
</P>
<P>
With 16 years of diplomatic experience, he has a lot of works
on the African politics and economy.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Diallo became the special advisor on African affairs
to the then U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar. From
1991 to 1992, he was the acting executive secretary of the U.N.
Commission on African Economy. And then, he had been in charge
of the secretariat of the U.N. agency in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Next Monday, the new U.N. envoy will go to South Africa's
Indian Ocean port of Durban to attend a meeting on Angola of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC)initiated by U.N.
Secretary-General Annan.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Reaches New Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Australia's battered dollar
suffered another king hit overnight to reach a new record low of
55.30 U.S. cents, prompting a rescue mission by the Reserve Bank
of Australian (RBA).
</P>
<P>
The effects of the central bank intervention, which occurred in
New York with the cooperation of the New York Federal Reserve,
lifted the currency back to around 56 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Analysts in New York said the intervention by RBA had come
after the local dollar hit 55.30 U.S. cents, its lowest level
since it was floated in 1983.
</P>
<P>
And as sellers continue to buffet the local dollar, fears
resurfaced that the RBA could still resort to a hike in interest
rates to support the currency.
</P>
<P>
Overnight, Canada and Norway lifted their interest rates to
save their own beleaguered currencies. But traders doubted such a
move would be effective in the current volatile climate.
</P>
<P>
Rory Robertson, senior economist with Bankers Trust, said,
"raising rates to defend currencies in today's circumstances is a
loser's game."
</P>
<P>
"We are clearly in the middle of something over which the RBA
has little control."
</P>
<P>
The offshore sell down followed new drama in Russia, filtering
through to the U.S. sharemarket which sent the Dow Jones
industrial average down 357.4 to 8166.
</P>
<P>
The Australian economy relies heavy upon commodities with fears
any move by Russia to sell its resources at lower prices to pay
off debt would drag down commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
The unfolding drama in Russia and turmoil on markets has seen
the Australian dollar lose almost 3 U.S. cents since the beginning
of the week, or 4.7 percent of its value.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed trading here at 80.27 yen from
82.87 and 1.0058 German marks from 1.0168.

<HEADLINE> Few Plan to Observe Diana Death Anniversary, Survey Finds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LONDON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Most British people have no
plans to observe the first anniversary of the death of Diana,
Princess of Wales, according to a newspaper poll released Friday.
</P>
<P>
The survey by The Daily Telegraph and Gallup says just six
percent of people are planning a commemoration on August 31, the
day Diana died in a car crash in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Of 1,009 people asked, 93 percent said they were not planning
any act of remembrance, the poll showed.
</P>
<P>
More than two-thirds of respondents said marking the
anniversary should be a matter of individual choice.
</P>
<P>
The Royal family, the Spencers and the government have all said
that Monday should be a personal, rather than a national occasion.
</P>
<P>
The poll also shows that a majority of people -- 58 percent --
believe the Royal family is more in tune with the national mood
since the death of the princess.
</P>
<P>
But there is marked opposition to naming the August Bank
Holiday "Diana Day" or establishing a joint memorial to the
princess and Dodi Fayed, her companion who died with her in the
accident.
</P>
<P>
And fewer than half of the people surveyed said they now
thought of Diana as having unique qualities.

<HEADLINE> US to Grant Tanzania $90,000 of Medical Supplies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States Friday
donated a batch of medical equipment to the Muhimbili Medical
Center (MMC) which has played a key role in providing medical
treatment to the victims of the August 7 bombing of U.S. embassy
to Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The Charge de Affaires of the embassy, John Lange, delivered
the assignment of medical supplies such as syringes, dressing
sponge and ventilators to MMC Director General Prof. Samuel
Maselle.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the medical assignment worth 90,000 U.S.
Dollars donated to Tanzania through the U.S. Office of Foreign
Disaster Stance, Lange said, adding that the rest will arrive in
the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
The charge de affaires expressed his "strong appreciation" for
the quick response of the medical center after the bombing three
weeks ago, which killed 11 people and injured more than 70
others.
</P>
<P>
Most of the wounded have been admitted into the hospital after
the terrorist attack. So far, all patients related to the
incident have been discharged after medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
The medical equipment was carried to Tanzania by the special
plane of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who visited
Dar es Salaam last week to inspect the damaged embassy and
console the victims, Lange said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the progress of investigation into the bomb blast,
Lange declined to comment. He also refused to say how many
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents are still in
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
However, Dudley O. Sims, the Director of the United States
Information Service (USIS) in Tanzania, revealed that some FBI
agents have already left here.
</P>
<P>
Sims also said that the new U.S. Ambassador to Tanzania Rev.
Charles Stith, 48, the minister of the Union United Methodist
Church in Boston, will come to office in the middle of next
month.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Vows to Stop Deforestation in Yangtze, Yellow River Basins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, Augest 28 (Xinhua) -- China today vowed to stop
deforestation in the Yangtze and Yellow river basins to
avoid flooding and improve the environment.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Yucai, Vice-Director of the State Forestry
Administration, deforestation on the upper reaches of the
country's major rivers was one of the reasons for the current
series of floods hitting China.
</P>
<P>
He said that the state this year will invest 3.12 billion yuan
(380 million U.S. dollars) in infrastructure, and 3 billion yuan
in special loans and financial allocations in the protection of
forest resources.
</P>
<P>
During a working conference which closed today, he also urged
forestry departments at all levels to take immediate action to
prepare for a nationwide forest-protection project.
</P>
<P>
"We will give first priority to the protection of
forests," the official said.

<HEADLINE> Super Train Put into Cross-border Service in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 28 (Xinhua) -- A double-deck electric train
of the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation (KCRC) started
cross-border operation on Friday, shuttling passengers faster than
ever between Hong Kong and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
The state-of-the-art KCRC Through Train, or KTT, is the first
electric train to run cross-border trips. Twelve double-deck
coaches offer "airline-style" seating, video screens and fold-out
tables, and twin locomotives propel the train, cutting the
110-minute trip by about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
At the launching ceremony Friday morning, K. Y. Yeung, chairman
and chief executive of KCRC, said KTT marked a milestone in the
through train services between Hong Kong and Guangdong province,
which were introduced in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Its operation is also of great significance to KCRC itself as
KTT is the first through train owned and managed by the company,
Yeung added. Previously all through trains to Guangdong Province
were run by Guangzhou Railway.
</P>
<P>
On the same day of KTT's maiden trip, Guangzhou Railway will
put its Xinshisu (New Speed) electric train into service.
</P>
<P>
The two pairs of trains will each make a return trip daily,
bringing the number of Hong Kong-Guangzhou through trains to four
pairs.

<HEADLINE> HK Economy Declines in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 28 (Xinhua) -- A crude initial assessment
suggested that the gross domestic product (GDP) of Hong Kong could
have fallen by around 5 percent in the second quarter of 1998 over
a year earlier, the government announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
In light of the lackluster performance so far, the government
forecasts that GDP for the whole year will contract by around 4
percent in real terms, compared with a 5.3 percent increase
recorded for last year.
</P>
<P>
The enormous drop for this year reflected largely the slowdown
in economic activities and the negative external factors following
the financial crisis in the region as a whole, financial secretary
Donald Tsang told a press conference Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The figure of negative 4 percent compared with the average of
negative 3 percent suggested by eight reputable forecasters of
Hong Kong's economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
But Hong Kong economy has been adjusting very speedily to
uphold competitiveness, with wages softening, asset prices falling
substantially and inflation at its lowest level since 1986, said
the financial official.
</P>
<P>
"The adjustment process is very fast and efficient," Tsang
noted.
</P>
<P>
As a free and open economy, Hong Kong cannot be left unscathed
when an unprecedented financial turmoil swept the region, said
Hong Kong's top financial official.
</P>
<P>
Tsang noted that a recovery can only be seen when the Japanese
economy improves and the yen stabilizes, and the turbulent Russian
financial market calms down.
</P>
<P>
Government Economist K Y Tang explained the second quarter
figure at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
A further slackening in both exports and local consumer demand
led to a negative 5 percent GDP growth in the second quarter,
which represented a further slow down from the 2.8 percent decline
recorded for the first quarter, Tang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's exports of goods slowed down further in the
quarter, with exports to those regional economies hit by the
financial turmoil falling markedly further, while exports of
services declined further along with the weakness in inbound
tourism, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
On the same time, he said, local consumer sentiment was hit by
the slackened income, increased unemployment, and the further
decline in asset prices.
</P>
<P>
He agreed with Tsang that, with the economic adjusting
efficiently, the cost of living and the cost of doing business in
Hong Kong have both moderated, enabling the city to uphold its
competitiveness in the world.

<HEADLINE> S. African Vigilante Group Denies Links to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 28 (Xinhua) -- A vigilante group in Cape
Town, South Africa, Friday denied that it is linked to the August
25 bombing in a U.S.-franchised restaurant following the arrest
of a member of the group.
</P>
<P>
The People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad) group said
that it dissociated itself from the bomb attack. It also sharply
criticized the police's handling of the investigation of the
case.
</P>
<P>
"The police must act in a serious and responsible way and not
just confine their investigation to a suspicion that Pagad was
somehow involved in the bomb attack," Pagad spokesman Cassiem
Parker said.
</P>
<P>
A man and two women were detained in the departure hall of
Cape Town International Airport Thursday afternoon as they were
about to board an Egyptian flight to Cairo. Police have
reportedly questioned them in connection with the Cape blast.
</P>
<P>
One person was killed and 27 others were injured in the
bombing, including some children.
</P>
<P>
But police denied that they arrested the three for
investigation of the bombing, saying that there were
discrepancies in the travel documents of the three and the
detention was carried out under the Aliens Control Act.
</P>
<P>
Pagad accused the police of conducting a witch-hunt against
the organization.
</P>
<P>
Police has been investigating a link between the restaurant
bombing and other blasts in Cape Town in recent months, in which
many people were killed or injured.
</P>
<P>
Numerous pipe bombs have exploded at the homes of gangsters
and drug lords in on-going skirmishes between the alleged drug
pedlars and Pagad. There are rumors that Pagad is linked to
Muslim extremists and has an anti-U.S. agenda.

<HEADLINE> Large Coal Gas Field Discovered in Northern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- A large coal gas field, covering
an area of 1,200 sq km and with potential a gas reserve of 200
billion cubic meters, has been discovered in north China's Shanxi
Province, according to sources from the Ministry of Land and
Natural Resources.
</P>
<P>
After two years of exploration, China United Coal Gas
Corporation Ltd. discovered the field in the southeastern
region of the province.
</P>
<P>
Three pits in the province's Tunliu County are expected to
produce more than 5,000 cubic meters of gas daily. And another
seven pits that the corporation plans to mine are estimated to
have a daily capacity of 10,000 cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The gas field, located within 200 km of large cities such as
Changzhi and Jincheng cities in Shanxi Province, and Zhengzhou and
Luoyang in Henan Province, will bring great social and economic
benefits to the region, according to the corporation.
</P>
<P>
The corporation said they plan to verify 300 sq km of the field
and ascertain gas reserves of 54 billion cubic meters by the end
of this year. They also plan to construct a coal gas field with an
annual capacity of one-billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that if the field is completely verified, the
annual production capacity could reach four-billion cubic meters.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Stocks Fall Through Key 900-Point Support Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Share prices took fresh
hammering on the Singapore Stock Market Friday as the benchmark
Straits Times Industrial Index (STII) dropped and punctured
through its key support level of 900 points following the Wall
Street plunge and the worsening crisis in Russia.
</P>
<P>
The STII lost 25.62 points to close at 885.26 points, the lowest
level in a decade.
</P>
<P>
Friday is the last day when the 30 year-old STII was used as a
market barometer and a revamped Straits Times Index (STI) will
take the place on August 31.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the market fell on the back of a weaker Wall
Street and concerns over Russia's economy.
</P>
<P>
The market was driven mostly by sentiment with fundamentals
having little influence, they added.
</P>
<P>
They also said activities were fueled by speculation over the
composition of the revamped STI index.
</P>
<P>
The total turnover increased to 180.74 million units valued at
293.68 million Singapore dollars (about 165.92 million U.S.
dollars). Losers outstripped gainers by 224 to 61 with 304
counters unchanged.

million counters changing hands.

end at 5.40 Singapore dollars. SIA F edged up 15 cents to finish
at 7.70 Singapore dollars. NatElec inched up eight cents to close
at 3.56 Singapore dollars.

<P>
He voiced deep concern about the missing Iranian personnel in
Afghanistan and assured the Iranian guest Pakistan's fullest
cooperation in helping to locate them.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the close, historical Pakistan-Iran relations
based on religious and cultural affinities, Sharif stressed the
need for closer contact at the leadership level between the two
old allies with a view to strengthening their ties.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official will also hold formal talks with Foreign
Minister Sartaj Aziz on important regional issues late in the day.
</P>
<P>
His one-day trip here follows the recent visit to Iran by
Pakistani State Minister for Foreign Affairs Siddique Khan Kanju.
</P>
<P>
Tension emerged between Pakistan and Iran since 11 Iranian
nationals have been missing in northern Afghanistan when the
Islamic Taliban captured Mazar-e-Sharif, headquarters of
anti-Taliban alliance, early this month.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan recognizes the Taliban regime while Iran accepts the
northern alliance led by former Afghan president Burhannuddin
Rabbani.

<HEADLINE> Australian Current Account Deficit Narrows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Australia's current account
deficit narrowed in the second quarter of this year after a boost
to both exports and imports, according to the latest official
figures released here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said the current
account deficit fell by 801 million Australian dollars (440
million U.S. dollars), or 11 percent, over the previous quarter to
a seasonally adjusted 6.518 billion Australian dollars (3.584
billion U.S. dollars) for the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said the result followed higher non-rural exports,
although this was partly offset by higher capital goods imports.
</P>
<P>
The ABS said exports of goods and services rose by 4.9 percent
to a seasonally adjusted 29.143 billion Australian dollars (about
16 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports were up 2.6 percent for the second quarter
to be worth 30.934 billion Australian dollars (about 17 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"In seasonally adjusted terms, the deficit on goods and
services at current prices was 1.79 billion Australian dollars
(984 million U.S. dollars), down by 560 million Australian dollars
(308 million U.S. dollars) in the June quarter 1998."
</P>
<P>
The bureau also said Australia's net foreign debt fell 1
percent to 222 billion Australian dollars (about 122 billion U.S.
dollars) by the end of the second quarter.

<HEADLINE> Bank of China Restructures Overseas Investment Bank Branch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China International
Holding Co. Ltd. (BOCI) moved its head office from London to
Hong Kong today, marking a successful ending to the Bank of
China's restructuring of its overseas investment business.
</P>
<P>
The BOCI, formerly a London-based investment banking subsidiary
of the Bank of China, is expected to take over the bank's overseas
investment business following this move to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
This restructuring will set up a series of specialized branch
companies under the BOCI, including BOC Group Trustee Co. Ltd.,
BOCI Asia Ltd., BOCI Capital Ltd., BOCI Asset Management Ltd.,
BOCI Investment Ltd., BOCI Research Ltd., BOCI Direct Investment
Management Ltd. and BOCI Securities Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The BOC expects that the restructured BOCI will develop into a
top regional investment bank in Hong Kong, specializing in
securities, financial consulting, mergers, asset management,
project financing, syndicated loans and direct investing.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of China International also vows to extend full
support to the domestic enterprise reform program by restructuring
state-owned enterprises and helping them raise funds on the
overseas capital market.
</P>
<P>
Opening at a time when the Asian economy is badly shattered by
the Asian financial crisis, and the international investment
banking sector faces severe challenges, the Bank of China
International will signal to the world the strong confidence the
BOC has in the Hong Kong market and its future.
</P>
<P>
Before the restructuring effort, the BOC was involved in a wide
range of investment banking ventures in Hong Kong including
securities placement, underwriting, securities trading, direct
investing and asset management.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Assures Safety of Athletics Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 28 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela moved swiftly on Thursday to allay fears over the
safety of participants in the forthcoming athletics World Cup in
the country following Tuesday's fatal bombing.
</P>
<P>
Many of the world's leading track and field stars will gather
at the Johannesburg Stadium for the eighth International Amateur
Athletics Federation (IAAF) World Cup in Athletics, a quadrennial
showpiece, from September 11-13.
</P>
<P>
A bomb exploded Tuesday night at a U.S.-franchised restaurant
in Cape Town, killing one person and injuring 27 others,
including international tourists.
</P>
<P>
Police suspect the blast is linked to anti-U.S. Muslim
extremists, who might intend to retaliate against U.S. missile
strikes at Sudan and Afghanistan last week.
</P>
<P>
The president's guarantees of safety came hot on the heels of
a report that U.S. athletics authorities were considering
withdrawing their team amid concerns for the safety of their
athletes.
</P>
<P>
"The South African security forces are equal to the task of
ensuring the safety of all participants in the World Cup," a
presidential spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
According to World Cup media liaison officer Chris Day, the
U.S. team management is due to meet today over the issue.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the local organizing committee of the World
Cup had already sent a report to U.S. officials guaranteeing them
the safety of their athletes.
</P>
<P>
"The report was commissioned after discussions at the highest
level," he said, referring to meetings with Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it was also announced that the eight men's and
women's teams would be competing for the Nelson Mandela Trophy
during the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Trophies bearing the president's name would also be presented
at all future World Cup events, the IAAF said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The body said the continental team event emphasizes team
rather than individual and therefore places special focus on
unity. Mandela is the one person in the world who best
personifies the quest for unity.

<HEADLINE> Tibetans Poised to Combat New Flood Crest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The People's Liberation Army (PLA)
troops stationed in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region and
local Tibetan residents are poised to fight another flood crest
that is expected to arrive before September 10.
</P>
<P>
Lingering rainfall since mid-August has raised water levels in
Tibet's major rivers, including the Yarlung Zangbo River, and in
some places flood waters have submerged large farming areas
and damaged many houses over the several past weeks.
</P>
<P>
The joint efforts of some 100,000 local residents and PLA men
have greatly alleviated the flood situation and successfully
evacuated many flood victims, holding economic losses to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
However, meteorologists recently forecast that another round of
torrential rains affecting a large part of the autonomous region
is expected soon.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous regional government has thus allocated one
million yuan (120,000 US dollars) as emergency flood-fighting
funds, which will be used to repair potentially dangerous
embankments, reinforce old dikes, and fund the flood-fighting
patrolling troops who are working around the clock.
</P>
<P>
A senior engineer with the autonomous regional meteorological
department warned that although water levels in Tibet's major
rivers began to fall at 8:00 a.m. today, the new round of rainfall
will once again raise water levels which are still near the danger
line, and as a result flood-fighters across the autonomous region
should remain alert.

<HEADLINE> Islamization, Right Step for Pakistan: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif on Friday said the introduction of Islamization in the
society is "the right step for the nation," adding that it will
not violate anyone's rights.
</P>
<P>
The 15th Constitutional Amendment Bill to make Quran and Sunnah
the supreme law in the country "will not violate anyone's rights
-- there should be no doubt on that count," Sharif told reporters
at the Parliament House.
</P>
<P>
He assured that an in-depth democratic debate will take place
on the bill "which is aimed at bringing about social justice and
welfare of the people."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the bill will be passed with
consensus by the two houses of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
"The bill provides for safeguarding the rights of the
minorities, and our friendship with other countries will continue,
we will have good international relations," he said in response to
a question about the reaction of foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, the prime minister announced in a live
television address to the nation that the 15th amendment is being
introduced in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said that the decision would change the social fabric of the
society, and lay a solid foundation for eliminating crime,
corruption and malpractice -- which have crept into the society
like "a rampant cancer."
</P>
<P>
A two-third majority in the Senate and the National Assembly is
required to pass the amendment. The government will get it passed
in the National Assembly easily, but face pressure in the Senate
as it does not enjoy a majority there.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to Islamize the society in Pakistan had been made by
late president Zia-ul-Haq. Opponents to Haq termed his attempts to
Islamize the society as cynical and politically motivated.

LAGOS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and South Africa soon
will sign a bilateral trade and cooperation agreement to enhance
the improved relations between the two countries following the
recent visit to South Africa by the Nigerian head of state.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will cover various areas including avoidance of
double taxation, protection of investment, science and
technology, and protection of fiscal evasion, Nigeria's state

The total trade between Nigeria and South Africa increased

<HEADLINE> Students Across Australia Rally Against Racism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- About 8,000 students and young
people across Australia rallied Friday against racism, condemning
the Australian federal government for its failure to combat
racism.
</P>
<P>
The national rally was staged in 14 cities, including all of
Australia's eight capital cities, such as Sydney, Canberra,
Brisbane, Melbourne, Hobart, Adelaide, Perth, Darwin, Newcastle
and Wollongong.
</P>
<P>
The national rally was organized by Resistance, a socialist
youth group in Australia. The group launched its campaign against
racism and anti-Asian immigration politician Pauline Hanson with
protests on July 24 and 28, when more than 14,000 students were
estimated to have walked out of school to attend rallies.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 students marched through Sydney Friday afternoon
demanding an end to what they called racist government policies.
</P>
<P>
Students burnt posters of Pauline Hanson as they marched from
Hyde Park, past State Parliament and on to Australian Prime
Minister John Howard's office in Phillip Street.
</P>
<P>
Sydney Deputy Mayor Henry Tsang addressed the students at Hyde
Park and urged them not to clash with police.
</P>
<P>
Ryan Liddell of Resistance, the rally's coordinator, said,
"It's not just Hanson and her One Nation Party that are racist,
it's also the very government of Australia itself."
</P>
<P>
About 500 students took to the streets in Melbourne Friday as
part of the national rally, the Australian Broadcasting
Corporation reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 250 students marched through central Brisbane,
Australia's third largest city, in a protest against racism.
</P>
<P>
In Adelaide, capital city of the state of South Australia,
labor union representatives joined 350 high school students to
rally against the perceived racism of Pauline Hanson's One Nation
party and the federal government.
</P>
<P>
Resistance member and rally organizer Arrow Tong said the
protest was needed because the federal government has failed to
make any effort to combat the racist views spread by Hanson.
</P>
<P>
"People are waking up and realizing the government is not going
to do anything to fight racism unless we ask them to," Tong said.

LONDON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Newcastle manager Ruud Gullit
promised on Friday his team would play exciting, entertaining
soccer when he takes over the English premier league club.
</P>
<P>
Newcastle announced on Thursday that Gullit would replace
Kenny Dalglish, who resigned after just two games into the new
Premier season.
</P>
<P>
"I want to be entertained and to win playing good, attractive
football," Gullit told Newcastle's Club Call.
</P>
<P>
"When I'm sitting on the bench as coach I'm like the fan. The
Newcastle fans know me. They saw me play, they know I like style."
</P>
<P>
Dutchman Gullit was due to arrive in Newcastle later on Friday
to sign a two-year contract and outline his plans at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
The first game in charge for the former Chelsea boss will be
Sunday's home game against Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
British newspapers reported on Friday that Dalglish was taking
legal advice after a statement from Newcastle saying he had
offered to resign.
</P>
<P>
"The chairman of Newcastle FC was advised on August 18 by
Kenny Dalglish that he wished to resign as quickly as possible
but not before a replacement was announced," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The club reluctantly agreed to release Kenny Dalglish from
his contract."
</P>
<P>
Local reports quoted Dalglish as saying: "I want to respond to
this and give my side of the story but I feel I need to take
legal advice and that will take time."

<HEADLINE> HK's Timepiece Export Steady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The export of watches and
clocks in Hong Kong remained steady in the first five months of
the year despite the unfavorable international trading environment
brought about by the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference Friday, Co-chairman of the Hong
Kong Watch and Clock Fair '98 Clement Cheuk said the Asian
financial crisis has undermined Hong Kong's exports of watches and
clocks to the region.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, strong economy in the United States and
noticeable growth in the European Union help to offset the decline
in exports to Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of the year, total exports of Hong
Kong's watches and clocks rose by 9 percent to the United States
and 11 percent to the EU, according to Cheuk.
</P>
<P>
In the same period, exports of timepiece from Hong Kong to
China's mainland and Japan, Hong Kong's second and third largest
timepiece buyers, registered decreases of 6 percent and 3 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
He added that Latin America and Eastern Europe have become
potential markets for Hong Kong companies.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that Hong Kong's total export of clocks and
watches in the first five months of the year remained basically at
the same level as that of last year.
</P>
<P>
Wong Hung Fai, also co-chairman of the fair, said Hong Kong
timepiece manufacturers should no longer concentrate on low to
medium-end products in the face of competition from other Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
"They have to move up market to produce high quality and
value-added items, and should also put emphasis on design and
production technology in order to maintain Hong Kong's position as
a leading producer of watches and clocks in the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Hong Kong scored a total timepiece export value of
46.8 billion HK dollars (6 billion U.S. dollars, including
domestic export and re-export).
</P>
<P>
According to the organizers, this year the Hong Kong Watch and
Clock Fair, scheduled for September 9 to 13, has attracted 808
timepiece companies from 15 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Exhibits will include all kinds of innovative watches and
clocks, related parts and components, as well as tools and
machinery.

<HEADLINE> Ningxia Emerges as China's Bordeaux for Wine Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region in northwest China is rapidly emergering as one of the
country's leading wine producers.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia's soil and climate conditions purportedly equal those
in Bordeaux, a region in southwest France famous for its high
quality grapes.
</P>
<P>
Years of research and comparative studies have led Chinese wine
experts to conclude that some 80,000 hectares of fertile land east
of the Helan Mountains provide great potential for the area to
become one of the world's best grape and wine production regions.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that loose soil featuring a high content of
organic matter, combined with over 3,000 hours of sunshine
annually, sharp disparities between day and night temperatures, a
dry climate and adequate irrigation, makes the region and ideal
location for vineyards.
</P>
<P>
The experts conducted an in-depth fact-finding visit to
Bordeaux in 1994 and concluded that the Ningxia region surpasses
the French region in terms of temperature and humidity.
</P>
<P>
The regional government has attached great importance to
related research, and is currently planting a 2,660-hectare
vineyard and constructing a winery with a designed annual capacity
of 40,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture also plans to establish vineyards
and wineries in Ningxia, home to the Hui ethnic minority
nationality.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia has already established a 200-hectare vineyard and a
modern winery producing highly popular "Xixia" (Western Xia) red
and dry wines. The region currently depends totally on grape
imports from France.
</P>
<P>
A number of leading Chinese winemakers, including those
producing Great Wall and Dynasty, have increased purchases of
grape juice from Ningxia, and the region is currently engaged in
talks concerning transfers of wine production technology from
France.

<P>
The Russian financial situation continues worsening with the
Russian rouble going into a free-fall triggered by Russian Central
Bank's suspension of all foreign exchange trading.
</P>
<P>
Blair said in a BBC Radio interview Friday morning: "It is a
very serious situation in Russia, there's no doubt about that at
all. The only answer and response to it is to carry on with the
process of reforms."
</P>
<P>
"That is the only way for Russia to get out of the financial and
economic difficulties that it has," Blair said, adding: "The
program and plan that has been put together over a long period of
time by the international institutions does genuinely offer the only
way out of this."
</P>
<P>
In other developments, Blair had a brief phone conversation with
U.S. President Bill Clonton Thursday night, exchanging views
on the Russian economic situation and Clinton's coming visit to
Russia.

<HEADLINE> Zambia, Zimbabwe Trade Imbalance to End: Chiluba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The imbalance in bilateral trade
between Zambia and Zimbabwe will soon be normalized following a
series of discussions between the two countries, Zambian
President Frederich Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
President Chiluba disclosed this Thursday in Lusaka before his
departure for a three-day state visit to Zimbabwe at the
invitation of his Zimbabwean counterpart Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia Daily Mail newspaper Friday quoted Chiluba as
saying that there are a lot of discussions between the two
nations and he hopes an "amicable" solution would be found soon.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the Zambian government and industrial
sectors have been accusing Zimbabwe and South Africa of turning
Zambia into a dumping ground, and urging the play ground must be
evened.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba is very optimistic about the future of the bilateral
trade and believes that the trade imbalance between Zambia and
Zimbabwe would end soon.
</P>
<P>
"Things are moving very well and I am very hopeful that the
anomalies will be rectified soon," said the Zambian leader.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Army to Remain Deep in DR Congo: General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan army will remain deep
in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) unless President
Laurent Kabila accepts a political solution to the crisis there,
a Ugandan general said.
</P>
<P>
Major General Salim Saleh, President Yoweri Museveni's brother
and senior presidential advisor on defense and security, made the
remarks in Uganda's northern district of Gulu Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's leading daily newspaper New Vision Friday quoted
Saleh as saying there is a sizable Ugandan military presence in
the DRC, but he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Saleh said that Uganda is being attacked by the DRC, Zimbabwe
and Angola and therefore Ugandan army should be in the central
African country to protect its national interests.
</P>
<P>
There is evidence that Kabila is arranging to attack us from
all frontiers and we have to defend ourselves, he added.
</P>
<P>
The call for cease-fire made at the summit of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) over the weekend should be
accepted and observed by both warring parties in the DRC, Saleh
asserted.
</P>
<P>
Since August 2 when war erupted in Kinshasa, Kabila has
accused Uganda of being behind the rebels and demanded Ugandan
troops to withdraw from his country.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Ugandan First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister
of Foreign Affairs Eriya Kategaya told Parliament that Ugandan
troops are in the DRC, not to support the rebels there but to
protect the national interests of Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Tea Production Drops in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's tea production was down
by more than 50 percent in the last two months, according to Kenya
Tea Development Authority (KTDA).
</P>
<P>
"With the cold season, production has fallen drastically,
sometimes as low as 60 percent," said a senior official at KTDA.
</P>
<P>
Tea yield had dwindled to 5,000 kilograms a day in some
factories, whose intake is in the average of 100,000 kilograms
during normal seasons.
</P>
<P>
Tea does well during wet seasons coupled with sunny weather
earlier this year, but the country, one of the world's leading
tea exporters, has experienced cold weather during the past three
months.
</P>
<P>
KTDA had predicted higher yields this year thanks to the El
Nino-related rains, expecting that tea output could reach 600
million kilograms compared to 520 million kilograms last year.
</P>
<P>
But the current cold weather may affect yields and production
of tea, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KTDA is pursuing the registration of a farmers'
bank before the end of this year in line with a resolution made
during the annual growers' meeting held on July 30.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, more than 500 representatives endorsed a
proposal to start National Tea Growers' Bank to serve the
interests of small-scale farmers.
</P>
<P>
Growers complained that commercial banks continued to reap
billions of Shillings every year from the framing community but
little had been done to avail affordable credit for the promotion
of agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Premier Zhu Rongji Addresses Religious Issues (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
reaffirmed here Wednesday that China practices freedom of
religious belief and noted that the nation's population of over
1.2 billion people includes of 100 million religious followers.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhu said, neither the proportion or influence of
religion in China equals that in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks while meeting with visiting Pat
Robertson, chairman of the Board of the Christian Broadcast
Network, and his party.
</P>
<P>
He said Robertson's China tour will help to enhance mutual
understanding between the American and Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Zhu went on to say that a large number of Chinese have
followed Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism over the past 2,000
years.
</P>
<P>
Confucianism is based on traditional concepts, morality and
philosophy, rather than on religion, Zhu said, adding that
Buddhism was introduced to China over 2,000 years ago and Taoism
originated in the country.
</P>
<P>
Zhu pointed out that Catholicism arrived in China in 1582 and
Christianity in 1807. He noted the history of both faithes in
China is thus comparatively short.
</P>
<P>
He said the nation has consistently pursued a policy of freedom
of religion since the founding of the the People's Republic of
China in 1949, and has clearly stipulated the policy in the
Chinese Constitution.
</P>
<P>
While some shortcomings might arise in China's practices
concerning unlawful activities conducted under the pretext of
religion, the Chinese government nonetheless fully respects and
protects religious freedom, said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, "I recently heard a report which
indicated that the number of lamaseries established in Tibet over
the past two decades has surpassed any period in history". Even
more importantly, the new lamaseries were established with funds
provided by the central government, rather than with donations
from the faithful, said Zhu.

"We have historically recognized the role of religion in social
development. Those who believe in religion and atheists alike
believe that people should enjoy spiritual strength", the premier

<HEADLINE> Premier Zhu Rongji Addresses Religious Issues (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chinese Premier said that China's economic growth could
reach the set goal of 8 percent in 1998, though the country's GDP
in the first half of the year grew by only 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's economy has stood the test of the Asian
financial crisis, and he reiterated that the Chinese currency will
not be devalued.
</P>
<P>
Zhu explained that the financial crisis in Asia which has
resulted in the deterioration of the international financial
environment has had a great impact on China's exports.
</P>
<P>
However, China has adopted measures to expand domestic demand
with a positive financial policy, and has enlarged the scale of
infrastructure construction to gear up for economic growth, Zhu
said.
</P>
<P>
China is confident of arriving at the economic goal of 8 percent
growth for 1998 as a whole through efforts in the latter half of
the year, Zhu told Robertson.
</P>
<P>
China's has achieved a quite favorable balance of trade in
recent years, Zhu continued, noting that with China's investment
environment much improved, direct foreign investment of 30
to 40 billion U.S. dollars flows into the country every year.
</P>
<P>
China's international income and expenses are basically balanced
and the country has experienced a sound financial market
with sufficient foreign currency reserves, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The fact that China has not devalued its currency in the face
of the Asian financial crisis has contributed greatly to Asia, and
to the world as a whole, Zhu said, emphasizing that the Asian
financial crisis will not have much influence on China's economic
development and reform process.
</P>
<P>
China's reform goal is to establish a socialist market economy,
which differs from that of other countries, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The difference between China's socialist market economy and the
capitalist market economy in the U.S. is that China insists on the
joint development of multi-formed ownership with public ownership
as the mainstay, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"We don't think public-owned enterprises must be worse than
privately owned ones. In fact, public-owned enterprises can be
managed very well," Zhu added.
</P>
<P>
The makeup of public ownership can actually be diversified, and
not limited only to the form of state ownership, Zhu elaborated,
noting that a diversified public ownership and the joint
development of multi-formed economic entities has in fact taken
shape in China.
</P>
<P>
The ownership of China's enterprises now has three
forms: state-owned, which generally accounts for 35 percent,
collectively owned, or firms under the cooperative system, which
is also a form of public ownership, accounts for another 35
percent, and the final 30 percent which is privately owned
including the overseas-funded firms, said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
Although the state-owned firms only account for one-third of
the total, they dominate the country's economy by providing 85
percent of China's tax revenue, Zhu noted, saying that China is
not privatizing the state-owned firms, but instead is gradually
changing them into shareholding enterprises, with the majority of
shares held by the state.
</P>
<P>
"This conforms to the situation in China", Zhu added.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also briefed the delegation on China's fight against heavy
flooding.
</P>
<P>
Robertson expressed admiration for the enormous progress in
China's economic development and his concern and sympathy for the
people in the flood-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is visiting China at the invitation of China's
State Bureau of Religious Affairs.

<HEADLINE> First Army Command, Staff College Opened in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's first Army Command
and Staff College (ACSC) was opened Friday by President Chandrika
Kumaratunga.
</P>
<P>
It is located at Sapugaskanda in the Northern suburb of
Colombo.
</P>
<P>
According to the ACSC Commandant Major General Anton Wijendra,
the objective of the college is to prepare selected officers for
the positions of majors and lieutenant colonels in command and on
the staff.
</P>
<P>
He said they hoped to expand the college to accommodate 50
officers by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
Wijendra explained that it costs the state 14,000 U.S. dollars
to send an officer for training at an overseas staff college. The
need for professional officers in the field has been acutely felt
as an average of only about four officers get the opportunity to
attend overseas command and staff colleges annually.

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Poland's Financial Market Hit by Russian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Polish President Aleksander
Kwasniewski called for calm on Thursday as the country's financial
market was rocked by the Russian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
WIG, the main index of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, dropped by
6.1 percent to 13,001.4 point on Thursday, while the Polish zloty
fell 0.32 percent against the U.S. dollar following a 1.9 percent
decline on Wednesday, reported the Polish Press Agency.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts pointed out that the turmoil was caused chiefly
by the poor performance of Polish enterprises, coupled with the
negative impact of the Russian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Poland's massive privatization program, scheduled to be carried
out this year and next year, may be indefinitely delayed, said
some financial experts.
</P>
<P>
They also predicted that the turmoil will also slow the pace of
the development of Poland's stock market.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski told a press conference on Thursday that the impact
of the Russian crisis is serious, but not destructive.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Polish people to stick to the reform policy,
observe the financial regulations and boost exports.

<HEADLINE> Malawian Currency Tumbles Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Malawian currency has hit
new low within four days to 42 Kwacha to one U.S. Dollar,
according to the Malawian central bank.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Malawi attributed the currency's
depreciation to a number of factors which include an 80 million
U.S. Dollar drop in the 1998 proceeds from tobacco exports.
</P>
<P>
But the central bank said that the situation would not
degenerate and would be stabilized soon.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday the currency dropped from 27 Kwacha to one U.S.
Dollar to 34 Kwacha to the dollar amidst hopes that it would
stabilize at that level.
</P>
<P>
The fall in the value of the South African Rand and the
Zimbabwean Dollar is also to blame because the two countries are
among Malawi's major trading partners.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Malawian government's last budget deficit of 600
million Kwacha (22 million U.S. Dollars) coupled with poor fiscal
policies have helped to worsen matters, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Malawi would like to assure the public
Tuesday that a further fall of such magnitude was unlikely to
recur in the near future.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said that unless Malawi had enough foreign
exchange coming into the country in the form of export sales and
foreign aid, it would be hard to stabilize the Kwacha.

<P>
WELLINGTON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand sharemarket
dived to a five-year low Friday after investors were spooked by
big falls in sharemarkets overseas as a result of the current
Russian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 3.3 percent or 63
points to 1848, copying falls in sharemarkets in New York, Tokyo

</P>
<P>
On the New Zealand sharemarket, there were 94 falls and only 2
rises among the stocks traded.

WELLINGTON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Shark cartilage, already
widely
promoted as a cancer treatment, may speed up wound recovery, the
Evening

Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper reported that the researchers
led by Dr

growth of new blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time the compound has been isolated and a
provisional
patent taken out, the paper quoted Dr Davis as saying.
</P>
<P>
Earlier research showed shark cartilage also contained an
ingredient
that could help prevent the growth of new blood vessels essential
to
cancer tumors.
</P>
<P>
Experiments are being carried out to see if shark cartilage can
reduce
haemangiomas or "strawberry marks" which afflict some children, Dr
Davis
said.

ISLAMABAD, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif Friday announced that the Holy Quran and Sunnah shall be
the supreme law in the country.
</P>
<P>
The 15th constitutional amendment bill is being introduced in
the parliament for the purpose, Sharif told the nation in a live
radio-television address in the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Delivering the epoch-making speech, the prime minister said
that the decision would change the social fabric of the society
and lay a solid foundation for eliminating crimes, corruption and
malpractice -- which had crept into the society like "a rampant
cancer."
</P>
<P>
"A surgery of this cancer is urgently required," he said.
</P>
<P>
The historic decision today, he said, would help in
establishing an Islamic social welfare state "which is the main
objective of our independence."
</P>
<P>
According to some constitutional experts, all courts will be
bound to decide cases according to the Quran and Sunnah after the
passage of the constitutional amendment in the two houses of the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
A two-third majority in the Senate and the National Assembly is
required to pass the amendment. The government will get it passed
in the National Assembly easily, but face problems in the Senate
as it does not enjoy a majority there.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The recent massive landslides
in India's Uttar Pradesh hills have caused devastation, claiming
350 lives so far in two districts and damaging property worth tens
of millions of U.S. dollars, official sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The main cause of the landslides, the worst recorded in the
northern Indian state, was the result of blunt deforestation and
rapid development of the region, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
On the nights of August 18-19, the Malpa village and Ukhimuth
township experienced massive rains followed by heavy landslides,
which have virtually washed away the entire village, where at
least 60 pilgrims were camping.
</P>
<P>
The death toll was around 200 in the village excluding the 60
pilgrims. The army, paramilitary forces and the Indian Air Force
with the help of local police have recovered only 32 bodies.
</P>
<P>
A search is going on for the rest of the bodies but reports
said it is almost impossible to recover more bodies because most
of them are buried under 21 meter high muddy debris.
</P>
<P>
The death toll in Ukhimuth might be about 125, but only 32
bodies have been recovered.

<HEADLINE> India Sets Up Body to Monitor Coastal Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has set
up a multi-disciplinary monitoring body to check coastal
pollution, official sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The body will assess the pollution load, identify the sources
and take up remedial measures against the pollution.
</P>
<P>
Certain coastal areas have been identified as "areas of
concern" and will be given priority. Ports in general have been
considered as one of the main culprits in pollution.
</P>
<P>
The Ocean Department has sponsored a plan of action on coastal
ocean monitoring and a prediction system. Guidelines are being
framed for the ports to follow them to regulate their discharge of
solid and liquid wastes into the sea, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the coastal-based industries discharging their
wastes which directly or indirectly enter the sea, municipalities
and other civic bodies also are answerable in this regard. Each of
the polluting sources, particularly those located in the "areas of
concern," are liable to prosecution if they discharge the
untreated wastes or effluents directly or indirectly into the sea
or stretches thereof.
</P>
<P>
The pollutants include diverse industrial wastes such as
synthetic organic chemicals, metals and radioactive materials,
petroleum hydrocarbons, sewage and litters. The discharges badly
affect the marine life and other living resources.
</P>
<P>
Activities at 11 large, 16 medium-sized and 78 small ports and
the spills left from oil imports have added to the problems along
the coast.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Beach Volleyball Aims High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PATTAYA, THAILAND, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's men's
beach volleyball team stands a very good chance to win gold in
the upcoming 13th Asian Games, the team's Australian head coach
Ken Breen told Xinhua Friday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua at the beach volleyball venue for
the Games, located in the famous beach resort city, Breen said
levels are even among men's beach volleyball teams in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Thailand may face challenges from Indonesia and Japan, but is
very likely to win a gold thanks to its four tough players and
good athletes management and training, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for the women's teams in Asia, the Australian said China,
Japan, Thailand and Indonesia are the four strongest.
</P>
<P>
It is possible for Thai girls to beat China and Japan and win
a bronze medal in the Asian Games, he said. But that will depend
on the group drawing and the girls' performance during the Games,
he added.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the unfavorable heights of both men and women
players, he said height is not the most important element in
beach volleyball since only one player will perform the block.
</P>
<P>
"Speed and tactic will compensate that," he said.
</P>
<P>
The players have advantages over their opponents since they
are training five hours a day and six days a week at the place
where the formal matches will be held and get familiar to the
wind and tide there.
</P>
<P>
Besides, as weather in countries like China and Japan are
getting cold, athletes there will pass their peak, while the Thai
players will continue training to reach their peak in December.
</P>
<P>
Before the Asian Games, both men's and women's teams will
participate in dozens of matches, including the Singapore Open.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Australian beach volleyball teams will come to
Thailand in November to help the Thais' training.
</P>
<P>
"Beach volleyball may become one of the successes of Thailand
in the Asian Games," Breen said in confidence.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Adopts Lockerbie Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The 15 members of the
United Nations Security Council voted Thursday to adopt a draft
resolution offered by the United States and Britain to change the
venue for the Lockerbie trial.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, unanimously adopted by the council following
two days of informal consultations, endorsed the U.S.-UK plan to
try the two suspected Libyans in the Netherlands under Scottish
law. It also voiced its appreciation of the Dutch government's
"willingness to cooperate in the implementation" of the plan.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also calls on the Libyan government to ensure
the appearance in the Netherlands of the two accused, and to
promptly make available at the court any evidence or witnesses in
Libya requested by the court.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also asked U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan to "assist the Libyan government with the physical
arrangements for the transfer of the accused from Libya directly
to the Netherlands."
</P>
<P>
The resolution said actions would be taken to "immediately
suspend" sanctions following the arrival of the two accused in the
Netherlands for the trial. The sanctions, imposed in 1992 to
force Libya to surrender the suspects, ban air travel to and from
the country, freeze some assets abroad and limit sales of oil
equipment.
</P>
<P>
Upon their arrival in the Netherlands, the two alleged bombers
will be detained by the Dutch government pending their transfer
for the purpose of a trial, the resolution added.
</P>
<P>
However, the resolution "expressed its intention to consider
additional measures if the two accused do not arrive or appear for
trial promptly."
</P>
<P>
It also insists that Libya satisfy French authorities
investigating the mid-flight bombing of France's UTA Flight 772
over Niger in 1989 in which 171 people died.
</P>
<P>
The two Libyans were accused of blowing up an American airliner
over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988, killing a total of 270
people.
</P>
<P>
China also voted in favor of the resolution. Before the voting
kicked off, Shen Guofang, Chinese acting permanent representative
to the United Nations, said that "part of the draft resolution can
still be improved in order to create a better atmosphere for the
settlement of the problem."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shen reiterated China's reservations over the two
Security Council resolutions, which impose and tighten sanctions
against Libya.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was adopted one day after the Libyan government
announced its acceptance to the change of trial venue, saying "it
will deal positively with this step and will give it the attention
it deserves."

<HEADLINE> Thailand Lobbies for hosting Int'l Medical Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Thai public and private
sectors have spent 12 million baht (292,628 U.S. dollars) to lobby
for the right to host an international medical conference in
Bangkok in 2002, according to the Gastro-Enterologists Association
of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Sawat Hitanant, chairman of the association, was quoted Friday
by the Bangkok Post as saying that he was confident that Thailand
would beat Singapore in the selection to be host of the 12th
Organization Mondiale de Gastro-Enterologies (OMGE) meeting, which
is forecast to bring more than 1.5 billion baht (36.5 million U.S.
dollars) into Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The association has spent 12 million Baht (292,628 U.S.
dollars), donated by the public and private sectors, to lobby OMGE
countries to vote for the 12th OMGE meeting at the Bangkok
International Trade and Exhibition Center, he said.
</P>
<P>
In March, the association invited representatives of OMGE
members to Thailand and the Foreign Ministry hosted a grant
reception for them, whereas Singapore just organized a cocktail
reception, Sawat said.
</P>
<P>
"If Thailand is selected to host the meeting, Thai doctors and
medical students will have opportunities to learn many things from
physicians worldwide without going abroad," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The country will gain more than 1.5 billion baht (36.5 million
U.S. dollars) from 16,000 meeting participants and their family
members," he said.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Wants to Settle Accounts With Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 27 (Xinhua) -- When it comes to settling debts
between Russia's gas companies and Ukraine's machine industry,
Ukraine is insisting on balancing the accounts, Ukrainian Prime
Minister Valery Pustovoitenko said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister told a press conference the method of debt
payment is one of the main issues under discussion with his
Russian counterpart Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
It is a position that Ukraine will adhere to, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pustovoitenko also expressed dissatisfaction with the failure
to carry out a Ukrainian-Russian long-term economic cooperation
treaty, sighed by the two countries' presidents in Moscow last
February. He attributed the failure to Russian inefficiency.
</P>
<P>
On Russian President Boris Yeltsin's naming Chernomyrdin as
acting prime minister, Pustovoitenko said it could be a major
factor in stablizing Russia politically and economically. He hoped
Russia would overcome its current crisis soon.
</P>
<P>
By July this year, Ukraine owed Russia 610 million U.S. dollars
for natural gas supplies. Russia, meanwhile, owned Ukrainian
machinery manufacturers several hundred million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The debt payment is a sticky matter between the two
countries. Last July, the Russian gas giant, Gazprom, temporarily
cut its deliveries to Ukraine by 20 million cubic meters in a bid
to force payment of the burgeoning debt.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- A Yunnan company of China has
reached a contract with the Myanmar Ministry of Industry on
repairing a state-owned cement factory in the Southeast Asian
country's central Magway division.
</P>
<P>
According to the contract, signed here on Thursday between the
Yunnan Machinery and Equipment Import and Export Corporation
(YMEIEC) and the Myanmar Ceramic Industries of the ministry, the
Yadana Theingi, a furnace of the Thayet cement factory is to be

</P>
<P>
The Thayet factory is one of the three state-run cement
enterprises in Myanmar and they have a combined annual output of
480,000 tons in the past five years. However, it is still far from
meeting the growing domestic demand.

The country imported 83.7 million U.S. dollars worth of cement
in the 1997-98 fiscal year, according to the latest official
statistics.
</P>

The statistics also show that China's investment in Myanmar
ranked the 16th with 29.26 million dollars in 9 projects at the

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Early Solution of Lockerbie Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- China on Thursday called
on all parties concerned to strengthen dialogue and consultation
for an early solution of the long-standing Lockerbie issue.
</P>
<P>
But China has reservations on some wording in a just-adopted
U.N. draft resolution, saying that "some elements of the
resolution could have been improved in order to create a better
atmosphere for the settlement of the problem."
</P>
<P>
Under the just-adopted resolution, the Security Council is
expected "to consider additional measures" if Libya failed to
surrender the two suspects.
</P>
<P>
The statement came when Shen Guofang, Chinese acting permanent
representative to the United Nations, took the floor on Thursday
night when the U.N. Security Council was considering a draft
resolution on the Lockerbie issue.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution, introduced by the U.S. and Britain
earlier this week, offered to try the two suspected Libyans of the
Lockerbie bombing in the Netherlands under normal Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
He also asked all concerned to "adopt positive and flexible
attitude towards the Lockerbie issue, reaching an early agreement
on specific aspects of the Lockerbie case by dialogue and
consultation for the early commencement of the trial procedure."
</P>
<P>
China remains firm against terrorism in all its forms and
manifestations, he said, adding that China condemns the Lockerbie
bombing and is deeply concerned over the outstanding issue.
</P>
<P>
China welcomes the new development in the Lockerbie issue, and
hopes such a positive development can be conducive to the early
suspension of sanctions against Libya, which was imposed in 1992,
Shen said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese envoy also voiced his hope that the cooperation
between all concerned parties can be helpful in early
determination of the truth of the Lockerbie case, and bringing
criminals to justice.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that the present development and the
cooperative attitude from the Libyan side will be conducive to a
decision by the Security Council for the lifting of sanctions at
an early date," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he also spoke highly of the fruitful efforts by the
Arab League and the Organization of African Unity toward peaceful
solution of the Lockerbie issue.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the Security Council members began to cast their
votes, Shen told reporters that "China's position on the Lockerbie
issue has always been consistent, and we hope the Lockerbie issue
will be solved as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
The two Libyans were accused of blowing up an American airliner
over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988, which killed a total
of 270 people.

BANGKOK, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Police and the military
intelligence force in Thailand have been put on alert against

officially recognized Budi Hardjono as the new chairman of the
conflict-ridden Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI).

<HEADLINE> Surgical Glue to Replace Stitches Approved By FDA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A super glue-like substance
made by Closure Medical Corp. was approved by U.S. Food and Drug
Administration Thursday for doctors to use in replacement of
stitches on skin-deep wounds.
</P>
<P>
The substance named DermaBond contains a variation of the
chemical used in Super Glue. It could form a flexible film
quickly over the wound that gradually wears off as new skin cells
grow beneath it.
</P>
<P>
According to the company, DermaBond has many advantages: taking
just half as much time to apply as sutures do and, with less
painful without a local anesthetic.
</P>
<P>
DermaBond is designed to replace stitches in skin-deep cuts or
the punctures of minimally invasive surgery. It is for topical
use only not for deep wounds under the skin.
</P>
<P>
However the FDA warned that doctors must thoroughly cleanse the
wound first, so bacteria are not sealed inside, and cannot use
DermaBond on infected wounds.

<HEADLINE> May Riots Provoked by Agitators: Jakarta Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Jakarta Governor Sutiyoso has
acknowledged that the May riots that hit the Indonesian capital
and other cities were provoked by agitators, according to national
newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
After a two-hour hearing here Thursday with the Joint
Fact-Finding Team investigating the riots, Suriyoso said there
were "operators in control of the riots."
</P>
<P>
"They were organized," he was quoted as saying, without
elaboration.
</P>
<P>
Sutiyoso is the second senior official to have testified before
the investigation team. On Wednesday, the team questioned former
Jakarta military commander Maj. Gen. Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin.
</P>
<P>
The investigation team was established by the government last
month to investigate reports that the May riots, in which more
than 1,200 people were killed, were masterminded.
</P>
<P>
Sutiyoso said he revealed everything he knew about the riots to
the investigation team, which is chaired by Bambang Widjojanto.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he deployed civil security officers to safeguard
Jakarta during the riots, he said: "Of course I did. Every officer
in the city was deployed and had been involved in securing the
city."
</P>
<P>
Bambang told reporters the governor was invited by the team to
accommodate them with accurate data about the riots.
</P>
<P>
He said the definition of "agitators", as mentioned by
Sutiyoso, could be groups of individuals acting independently of
one another.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that the groups may have been working in tandem
and following orders to hit certain areas.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian rights activists have said that 168 women and girls,
most of them ethnic Chinese, were raped and sexually assaulted
during the May riots, and about 20 of them died or committed
suicide.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine, Russia, Belarus Looking for Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Ukraine, Russia and
Belarus have pledged to step up economic cooperation among the
three countries after they met in the Crimean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax-Ukraine reported on Wednesday that the consensus
was reached on Wednesday night when Ukrainian President Leonid
Kuchma, Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko and Russian
Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin gathered together in
Crimea.
</P>
<P>
In a televised speech, Kuchma voiced support for the
Russian-Belarussian Union, which was set up last year.
</P>
<P>
"Russia and Belarus have gained lots of benefits from regional
cooperation," Chernomyrdin said. "But the cooperation between
Russia and Ukraine is a bit different."
</P>
<P>
He said that economic cooperation should be a priority in the
bilateral relations, adding that the two countries could build
more joint ventures and beef up financial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Ukraine is always ready to conduct the closest cooperation
with Russia," Kuchma said. He urged Russia to continue the project
of jointly manufacturing the An-70 transport plane.
</P>
<P>
An-70 was jointly designed by Russia and Ukraine and has become
a major rival of the U.S.-made C-130 transport aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin, who came to Ukraine for emergent talks with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), also proposed the presidents of
the three countries meet at a border town to discuss trilateral
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Panama Inaugurates Harpy Eagle Protection Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Panama City dedicated its
first world-level center Thursday for the protection of the
endangered harpy eagle, City Hall spokesman Jose Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
The complex, located in the Summit Botanical Garden in the
outskirts of Panama City, was suggested by an American zoologist,
Ron Magill, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The Panama City Mayor's Office, in cooperation with
international corporations, invested more than 1 million
U.S. dollars in the project to protect its national bird, Gonzalez
said.
</P>
<P>
Currently the center is sheltering two birds: a 20-year-old
female and a three-year-old male.
</P>
<P>
"The center also includes an aviary, which provides the birds
with an appropriate environment to live in, while providing people
with an opportunity to observe their development," said Gonzales.
</P>
<P>
An interactive center with modern visual equipment is under
consideration for visitors to the complex to provide all available
information on the harpy eagle.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt to Probe Banking Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
said it would soon send a special team to investigate crimes in
the banking sector, local leading newspapers reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The team will be drawn from the Indonesian Bank Restructuring
Agency (IBRI), the Attorney General Office and the Police, Justice
Minister Muladi was quoted as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The team would investigate all the private banks which had
received liquidity credits from Bank Indonesia, the central bank,
said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Under the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) reform package,
banking restructuring is one of Indonesia's top priorities in
efforts to revive the economy.
</P>
<P>
Economists say an unsound banking system greatly contributed to
the country's economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia is reported to have lent at least 135 trillion
rupiah (12.3 billion U.S. dollars) as of August 14 to the
insolvent banks in the form of liquidity assistance. Some of funds
channeled became bad debts, while others were misused by bankers.
</P>
<P>
"Our priority is to resolve the administrative aspect of the
cases in the civil court so that we can get the money back. Any
criminal charges would follow thereafter," Muladi said.
</P>
<P>
As part of its sweeping economic reforms, the government last
week froze the operation of three private banks, nationalized four
private banks and merged four state banks.

worth of non-oil products since the beginning of this year, up
18.2 percent over the same period last year, the Coordination and
Planning Office reported.
</P>
<P>
It said the country's total imports have maintained a steady

Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
SAN JOSE -- Costa Rica's international cash reserves diminished
by 90 million dollars in the last three months, according to
Central Bank statistics.
</P>
<P>
The drop was caused by a reduction of coffee exports in the

Coffee exports are Costa Rica's third largest earner of hard
currency, after bananas and tourism.
</P>

<HEADLINE> One Quarter Costa Ricans Live Below Subsistence Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Almost one quarter of the Costa
Rican population cannot earn enough to satisfy their basic needs,
said a study published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This means 800,000 people in the country have difficulty in
meeting their lowest demands for food, housing, transportation,
education and other basic services.
</P>
<P>
The subsistence level for a family of four, according to the
Ministry of Economy, is 127,000 colons (490 U.S. dollars) per
month. However, most workers can only earn the minimum salary of
75,000 colons (290 dollars).
</P>
<P>
As a result, a large number of women have to go out to find a
job. At present, women make up 30 percent of the labor force,
said Henry Mora, director of the School of Economy of the National
University.
</P>
<P>
Because of families' difficulty in making ends meet, children
are also found seeking jobs in the labor market.

Austria are pushing too hard to encourage the return of Bosnian
refugees for ... understandable domestic reasons," said a senior
U.S. official at a briefing on Albright's trip to Europe next week.
</P>
<P>
Starting Saturday, Albright will visit Croatia and Bosnia, then
go to Moscow for a U.S.-Russian summit before spending a few hours
in the Austrian capital on September 3.
</P>
<P>
The official said the main purpose of her trip to Vienna is to
acknowledge Austria's role as current president of the European
Union, but added that the issue on refugees will be on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
The official said that unless there is careful planning,
refugees tend to go to areas where their ethnic group is in the
majority rather than to their original homes, where other ethnic
groups might now be in control.
</P>
<P>
The United States had proposed to the European Union to work on
a program to make sure that returns took place "in a carefully
managed environment," he added.
</P>
<P>
About 12,000 refugees have returned to Bosnia in the last six
weeks, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
He said the German government was "extremely unhappy" about
past U.S. criticism of its refugee policy.
</P>
<P>
The official charged that European governments had failed to
respond adequately to an appeal for funds to train and equip local
police in Bosnia. Germany had provided no funds for this purpose,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of Albright's trip to Bosnia is to demonstrate
U.S. support for the elections next month. "In many ways, this
will be the first real post-war elections," said the official.

CANBERRA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian Labor Party's tax plan released Thursday
failed to offer genuine tax reform and widens the divide between
rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian Labor Party, the nation's leading opposition
party, used the release of its tax plan Thursday to signal its
return to its blue-collar base, slugging the rich to deliver big
handouts to low-income odd job workers with imposing a goods and
services tax.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian Labor Party has won fairness and lost on
reform with a tax package that draws the battlelines for what
promises to be the most polarized election campaign since the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian dollar plunged to an all-time low Thursday as
international investors dumped commodity currencies amid deepening
fears that the Russian crisis would spark a global economic
decline.

<HEADLINE> Nestle Tries to Increase Market Share in Central Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Nestle-Sofia's main objective is
to become the main chocolate and confectionary producer among
Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) member states, the
company's Director General Mitris Koronakis said at a news
conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nestle-Sofia, a subsidiary of the Swiss Nestle company, is
marketing 7 to 12 percent of its output in the former Soviet
Republics, Hungary and South Africa. The percentage is expected to
increase to 20 percent soon.
</P>
<P>
Nestle-Sofia is to introduce some 26 new products here,
Koronakis said, adding that the company will also import three
kinds of Delly Super chocolate desserts by mid-September along
with 11 kinds of sugar and caramel sweets.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to sell the products at the same prices across the
country despite transportation costs," Nestle Sales Director
George Makridimitris said.
</P>
<P>
The new distribution network of the company, employing 150
distributors and 120 light and heavy duty trucks, went into
operation this week.

<HEADLINE> China Lowers Price of Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, August 28 (Xinhua) -- China's medicine retail sales
price has been increasing at a lower rate as a result of the
country's efforts to lower the price of medicine.
</P>
<P>
Previously, medicine retail sales price had been increasing by
10 percent annully, but in the first six months this year it rose
by only 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the country examined and verified all
medicines listed by the central government, both imported and
domestic, and lowered the price of home-produced medicine by 15
per cent, or four billion yuan, and of imported medicine by 10 per
cent, or two billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
There are still problems such as some expensive medicines found
to be of low quality, and some medicine producers who offer high
commissions to those in charge of purchasing medicine for
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
According to officials, money spent for medicine was 51
percent of all the money spent for all medical care services, a
percentage too high for a balance price system.
</P>
<P>
To rationalize the price system, 15 provinces have raised the
cost for medical care services while lowering the price of
medicine.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Falls Along with Stock Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar fell against
most major currencies Thursday as the global financial markets
were affected by Russian and Asian economic crises.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican peso dropped to another record low, as did the
Canadian dollar.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 142.18 yen,
down from 144.02 late Wednesday. It also was trading at 1.7941
marks, down from 1.8061 marks, and 1.5788 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.5677.
</P>
<P>
The Russian central bank suspended dollar trading to preserve
its dwindling foreign reserves for the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
A number of countries intervened in foreign exchange markets or
raised interest rates. But none of those actions could protect
their currencies from falling.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday: 1.4809 Swiss francs, down from 1.5059; 6.0135 French
francs, down from 6.0545; 1,775.00 Italian lire, down from
1,781.50.
</P>
<P>
The British pound was quoted at 1.6523 U.S. dollars, up from
1.6385 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Dollar Drops Despite Rates Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The battered Canadian dollar
continued its free fall Thursday despite of a one-percentage-point
interest rates hike by the Bank of Canada.
</P>
<P>
To prop up Canada's currency, the loonie, the central bank
raised its bank rates to 6.0 percent Thursday, a stern medicine it
had previously refused to deliver for fearing of slowing down the
economy.
</P>
<P>
The loonie rebounded briefly, then plunged to an all-time low
of 63.09 cents U.S. during the day. It closed at 63.31 cents U.S.,
down 0.57 of a cent.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's rates hike came after the Canadian dollar made a new
record low Wednesday, dropping for the first time below 64 cents
U.S. in its 140-year history.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Canada said the increase in interest rates "is
aimed at providing support for the Canadian dollar in order to
bolster confidence."
</P>
<P>
Yet, so far the move has been proved to be futile. The bank
does not have enough power to stop the falling of the dollar in
the current turmoils of Asia and Russian financial crises, some
economists say.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of this year, the Canadian dollar has lost more
than 11 percent of its value against the strong U.S. dollar.

<HEADLINE> Moldovan Deputy-Prime Minister Visits Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The relations between Romania
and the Republic of Moldova have good prospects, Romanian Foreign
Minister Andrei Plesu said on Thursday, after talks with the
visiting Moldovan deputy-Prime Minister and Minister of Economy
and Reform Ion Sturza.
</P>
<P>
Ion Sturza, who also chairs the Interministerial Committee for
Moldova's relations with Romania arrived Wednesday in Romania on a
three-day official visit, at the invitation of Romanian Foreign
Minister Andrei Plesu, the President of the Interministerial
Committee for the country's relations with Moldova.
</P>
<P>
According to the national Rompres news agency, the
Interministerial Committee's role and activity were examined in the
talks, with special attention on the preparation of the October
meeting of the Interministerial Committees in Moldovan capital
Chisinau.
</P>
<P>
The talks focused on joint targets, and the cooperation in the
power field is one of the most important topics approached,
Romania's chief diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Ion Sturza is optimistic about the future of ties between his
country and Romania. "We have a legal frame, more than 40
agreements on various levels and, it is very important to start
their implementation more actively. There are a few fields of the
utmost importance, such as the power field," Ion Sturza said. He
added that the Republic of Moldova entirely depended on the
imports of power resources, because it produced only 20 percent of
the consumption power. "We hope to attract strategic investors
from Europe and the USA and we think this will allow us to get
investment funds for a joint market of power resources."
</P>
<P>
The Moldovan guest was received Thursday by Emil
Constantinescu, the President of Romania.

surrendering to Iraq's whims over the impasse on weapons
inspection.

<HEADLINE> Suspect Charged with Murder for Nairobi Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A suspect in the bombing of the
U.S. embassy in Nairobi was charged with murder by Manhattan
federal prosecutors on Thursday, 20 days after the incident which
killed 257 and wounded more than 5000.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-'Owhali, also known as Khalid Salim
Saleh Bin Rashed, was ordered detained pending a September 28
appearance.
</P>
<P>
The 14-count complaint by the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) charged the defendant with murder, murder conspiracy and use
of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The complaint charged that he confessed to his role in the
bombing and said he would die as a "martyr" on August 7, the day
of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
The complaint said the plot began in March and the defendant
admitted that on August 7, he threw a "small grenade-like device"
toward a guard outside the U.S. embassy in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
According to court papers, Owhali was arrested by Kenyan
officials two days after the bombing and turned over to the FBI
later.
</P>
<P>
He confessed that he was trained in explosives, hijacking and
kidnapping in camps in Afghanistan, including attending meetings
and conferences chaired by terrorist financier Bin Laden chased by
the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Owhali was flown by the FBI to New York on Wednesday night, FBI
Director Louis J. Freeh told a press conference in Washington
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno who joined the press conference
together with other senior Administration officials, described
Owhali's arrest as "the most extensive overseas investigation" in
U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
Another suspect of the bombing, Mohammed Sadiq Odeh, was sent
to the U.S. on Thursday for trial.
</P>
<P>
Odeh had been held by Kenyan authorities since August 14 after
his arrest in Karachi, pakistan, on the day of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said several other suspects held in Kenya could
also be sent to the U.S. for trial.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Introduces School Safety Guide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Thursday introduced a new education guide to help prevent school
violence and ordered the expansion of the Police Corps.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Worcester, Massachusetts, Clinton said the "Early
Warning, Timely Response: A Guide to Safe Schools" was to help
educators, parents and fellow students to recognize and then
respond to early-warning signs.
</P>
<P>
It will help schools to recognize a troubled or potentially
violent young person, and it outlines steps to intervene early,
before it is too late, Clinton explained.
</P>
<P>
The guide, which was developed by the Department of Education
and the Department of Justice following a series of school
shootings earlier this year, will be distributed to every school
before the start of the new school year.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also ordered the expansion of the Police Corps to
provide more college scholarships, with preference given to the
children of police officers killed in duty.
</P>
<P>
"The fight against crime is, in the last analysis, a fight to
preserve that quality of community which is at the root of our
greatness, a fight to preserve confidence in ourselves and in our
fellow citizens, a battle for the quality of our lives," Clinton
said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Plunges in Global Selloff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Dow industrials plunged 357
points Thursday, its third-biggest point loss ever and the biggest
percentage drop since last October's tumbling.
</P>
<P>
Wall Street's plummet in heavy trading happened as Russia's
worsening economic crisis and disappointment for Japan's efforts
to revive its crippling economy sent stocks down around the globe.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 357.36, or by 4.2
percent, to 8,165.99, according to closing figures.
</P>
<P>
The drop left the Dow 1,171 points, or 12.6 percent, below its
July 17 record high closing of 9,337.97. A drop of 10 percent is
considered a "correction," while a sustained decline of 20 percent
marks a bear market.
</P>
<P>
The Dow, which once was up 18.1 percent this year, is now up
just 3.3 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
The slide of 357 points was the third-biggest point drop ever,
behind the record 554.26 points of October 27, 1997, and the
508-point "Black Monday" crash of October 19, 1987. In percentage
terms, the 4.2 percent tumble was the biggest since the 7.2
percent drop of last October's plunge but far behind Black
Monday's 22.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 slid 40.03 to 1,044.15, and the
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index skidded 77.27 to 1,690.86.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 15-to-2 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled a scorching
934.66 million shares, as against 671.85 million in the previous
session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index dropped 20.74 to 518.82, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index fell 24.84 to 169.08
</P>
<P>
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 14.33 to
366.09.
</P>
<P>
Prices soared on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds, while bond

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Four Cuban exiles pleaded
innocent Thursday in Puerto Rico to charges that they plotted to
kill Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
The four were among seven exiles, including a director of the
Cuban American National Foundation, the most influential Cuban
exile group, indicted by a federal grand jury in San Juan Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The case is believed to be the first such court case after
years of alleged plots against Castro. They were freed on bail by
the U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
It could be months before the case comes to trial. The FBI said
more arrests and indictments were expected.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Attorney General Janet Reno was asked Thursday
whether the indictment represented a change in U.S. policy, and
she said she was not aware of any change.
</P>
<P>
The indictment was believed as a blow to the Miami-based Cuban
American National Foundation, of which he is a director. Castro
has accused the foundation of plotting to kill him, but the group
says it is committed to peaceful political persuasion.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the State Department denied the idea that the
indictment implied that the administration is changing its
policies towards Cuba.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Police: Step Closer to Finding Omagh Bombers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Northern Irish police said
Thursday it was a step closer to catching the Omagh bombers after
the police reconstructed the bomb timer used in the blast.
</P>
<P>
"We have been virtually able to reconstruct the timing-power
unit of this bomb," said Ronnie Flanagan, head of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary police in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
"We know that unit is very similar to units that have been used
in perhaps the last five or six explosive attacks carried out by
the so-called Real IRA," BBC quoted him as saying at a news
briefing.
</P>
<P>
The Real IRA, a splinter republican group, admitted planting
the bomb in a shopping center in Omagh which killed 28 people and
injured 220 others nearly two weeks ago. The group declared a
cease-fire four days after the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Flanagan said the device had been contained in a small plastic
sandwich box, and urged shopowners to contact the RUC or the Irish
police if they had recently sold these items.
</P>
<P>
He also said other leads were being followed and he was
confident of finding those responsible for the Omagh atrocity.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Security Council
members are expected to cast their votes late Thursday on a draft
resolution, offered by America and Britain to endorse a plan to
try the two suspected Libyans in the Lockerbie case.
</P>
<P>
Danilo Turk, president of the 15-member Security Council told
reporters here that "the council has decided to convene this
evening for a formal meeting to take action on the resolution."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council went on with informal consultations on
Thursday morning to ponder over the draft resolution, which
proposed an endorsement to an American-British plan to hold the
trial of the two accused Libyans in the Netherlands under the
normal Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
However, the draft resolution proposed "additional measures"
against Libya "if the two accused have not arrived or appeared
for trial promptly," diplomatic sources here said.
</P>
<P>
The two Libyans were accused of blowing up an American
Airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988, which

<HEADLINE> G-7 Economies Seen to Grow 1.8 Percent This Year and Next </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Economic growth in the G-7
industrialized nations will average 1.8 percent for both this year
and next, an economic think-tank predicted here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Consumer prices of these seven countries will rise by only 1.4
percent in 1998 and 1.8 percent in 1999, according to the 1998
Summer World Outlook by the Conference Board of Canada.
</P>
<P>
"Japan remains the principal brake on G-7 growth," said Peter
Lok, author of the economic report.
</P>
<P>
"With personal consumption and business investment continuing
to tumble, the outlook for Japan remains bleak. And Japan, being
the dominant economy in Asia, is dragging the region into
recession," he said.
</P>
<P>
The report predicted a slow and painful recovery will begin in
Japan in 1999, with economic activity expanding by only 1.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
The outlook for the North American economy remains robust.
Economic growth will reach 3.1 percent this year before slowing
down to two percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Consumer prices in the region are forecast to rise by an
average of only 1.8 percent this year but will accelerate to 2.9
percent in 1999 as growth begins to pick up again in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The economies of Western Europe, as a whole, will post a
moderate growth of 2.8 percent this year and 2.7 percent in 1999
with the major economies moving in various directions, according
to the forecast.

MOSCOW, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese President Tran Duc
Luong, who on Thursday left Moscow for St. Petersburg to continue
his visit to Russia, and Governor of St. Petersburg Vladimir
Yakovlev have reached an agreement on all-round cooperation,
according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese president said that during his meeting with the
governor of St. Petersburg they exchanged views and agreed on
issues of all-round cooperation between St. Pertersburg and the
Republic of Vietnam, as well as Ho Chi Minh City.
</P>
<P>
St. Petersburg used to have close economic, scientific and
cultural ties with Vietnam and was a sister-city with Ho Chi Minh
city.
</P>
<P>
Governor Yakovlev said that the city administration was
interested in Vietnamese business people coming to St. Pertersburg
and Vietnam's state orders being placed at city enterprises.
</P>
<P>
According to Yakovlev, the two sides also agreed on other
issues, including the revival of the twin-cities ties between
St.Petersburg and Ho Chi Minh city, the mutual trade and the
establishment of a network of Vietnamese restaurants in St.
Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese president arrived in Moscow on Monday on an

<HEADLINE> Papantoniou: Greek Drachma Not Affected Directly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Greek National Economy and
Finance Minister Yiannos Papantoniou said Thursday that the Greek
national currency, drachma, was not affected directly by Russia's
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that it suffered certain pressures due to the
liquidation of earnings from the Greek treasury bills as it had
happened with the treasury bills of other European governments.
</P>
<P>
Describing the crisis in Russia as "the result of the problems
in the political and structural policy, he said that all the
European economies with significant economic, trade and banking
transactions with Russia and Asian money markets have been
affected by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the Bank of Greece and the Greek
government closely follow the developments and would take all
necessary measures for the normalization of the situation.
</P>
<P>
Worries over the crisis in Russia put intense pressure on the
Greek economy and the drachma Wednesday hit fresh lows against the
mark and other major currencies, amid a sell-off in government
bonds.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the total outflow came to 1.7 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
To defend the bond market and the drachma, the Greek central
bank intervened heavily in the domestic markets by spending 1.2
billion dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The resignation by an
American U.N. weapons inspector would not affect U.N. weapons
inspection in Iraq, China said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Scott Ritter on Wednesday quitted his post in the United
Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, and his resignation was
accepted immediately by UNSCOM Executive Chairman Richard Butler.
</P>
<P>
In his letter of resignation, Ritter strongly criticized the
U.N. Secretary-General and the Security Council for being too weak
to take tougher stance towards the recent standoff between Iraq
and UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions by reporters on the resignation,
Chinese Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations Shen
Guofang said he was not surprised at Ritter's resignation, and
Ritter's departure can not and would not affect UNSCOM's work in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Shen said Ritter's comments on the Security Council were his
personal opinions, and the Security Council has always urged the
comprehensive implementation of its relevant resolutions by
calling for Iraq 's fully compliance as well as acknowledging the
progress made in the areas of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.

MAPUTO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican Foreign Affairs

the blast in South Africa's Cape Town, which killed at least two
and injured 25 others.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that "at a time when the international

Terrorism constitutes a serious threat to world peace and
security, the statement noted.
</P>

The explosion occurred Tuesday at a U.S. franchised Planet

linked to U.S. strikes against alleged Moslem terrorists in Sudan
and Afghanistan last week.
</P>
<P>
The South African government has expressed its shock at the

<HEADLINE> Arab League: Libya Needs Time to Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Assistant Secretary
General Ahmad Adel Thursday underlined the necessity of giving
Libya enough time to study the U.S.-British proposal on settling
the Libya-West Lockerbie crisis.
</P>
<P>
Adel, speaking to Egypt's Middle East News Agency, said that he
underlined the importance of giving Libya time to consider
measures and get clarifications on this score during his meeting
Thursday with the political affairs department chief of
U.S. Embassy in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Adel said AL officials have held two rounds of talks with the
U.S. official since Wednesday on the U.S.-British initiative which
was announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Libya late Wednesday accepted the U.S.-British proposal that
the two Libyan suspects in the 1988 bombing of an American plane
be tried by a panel of three Scottish judges under Scottish law in
the Hague, The Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in an interview with the U.S. Cable News Network,
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi said he does not trust the United
States and Britain, saying they may play tricks in handing the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi also said time is needed to study the proposal and "more
details must be worked out, adding the suspects are human beings,
not "tins of fruits."
</P>
<P>
He also demanded the U.N. sanctions imposed on Libya since 1992
to force the handing over of the suspects to be lifted. They ban
air travel and arms sale and include financial restrictions.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have long urged Libya to hand over the two
suspects to stand trial in either of the two countries. But
Libya's refusal to comply incurred the U.N. air and arms embargo
in 1992. The bombing killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council is discussing a proposal by the
U.S. and Britain on suspending the U.N. sanctions against Libya if
the two suspects are received in The Netherlands.

MOSCOW, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Russian presidential press
service Thursday night officially refuted allegations of impending
resignation of President Boris Yeltsin.

<P>
In the fax release the press service said that any information

is invented and false.
</P>

It said that Yeltsin executes the whole fullness of power in

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The White House said on
Thursday that U.S.-Russia summit preparations still continued
Thursday despite the political and economic crisis in Russia.
</P>
<P>
"This is an extraordinarily important relationship," said Sandy
Berger, the U.S. national security adviser, referring to the
U.S.-Russia summit, which is scheduled to be convened next week in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Berger cautioned that if the newly revamped Russian government
veered away from economic and political reform, "if it changed
fundamentally, that would be of serious concern to us."
</P>
<P>
"It's appropriate the trip continue, and I wouldn't speculate
on any other scenario," Berger told reporters at a news conference
at the Justice Department on the prospective trial of suspects in
the August 7 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
In response to questions on a report Yeltsin had signed an
undated resignation document, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright told reporters: "we have had no confirmation or comment
on that."
</P>
<P>
Reports from the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard,
where President Bill Clinton is vacationing, said that Clinton
also refused to answer questions from reporters about the
resignation reports.
</P>
<P>
Dimitri K. Simes, president of the Nixon Center, a
Washington-based research center, said Yeltsin has lost all
credibility with the Russian people, and a majority think he
should resign.
</P>
<P>
"The Yeltsin period is coming to an end. The sooner the
better," said the longtime Russia analyst.
</P>
<P>
He said Clinton should postpone his visit to Russia. "I have no
idea why President Clinton is going to Moscow," Simes said.

<P>
CAIRO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa urged all parties in the Middle East peace process to
dispel the sense of frustration.
</P>
<P>
"There is no guarantee of peaceful coexistence but an action on
the ground for establishing peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the call while commenting on a bomb explosion in
Tel Aviv Thursday morning, in which 21 people were injured.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Palestinian-Israeli direct peace talks, on and
off, since July 19 on Israeli troops redeployment in the West
Bank, Moussa said he did not rule out the possibility of clinching
a deal by September 13 as announced by U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
September 13 marks the fifth anniversary of the singing of the
Oslo Accord, which kicks off the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are haggling over the scope of redeployment and
no signs of development toward an agreement have been reported.
</P>
<P>
"It is hoped for, especially if the parties reached balanced
and just commitments based on the U.S. initiative. However, there
are no reports yet available on any progress regarding the set
terms."
</P>
<P>
"It is, anyway, up to the Palestinians to decide. The agreement
has to do with their future commitments and the way the
Palestinian peace track would move," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt prefers a balanced and unconditioned agreement be
reached so that the Palestinian side could accept it easily," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Special Interests Make Donations to Congressional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, who isn't up for re-election until 2000, raised almost
100,000 dollars in three months from health-related groups while
senators considered whether to impose new rules on health
maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
Much of that money will go to help his party's incumbents and
challengers.
</P>
<P>
Lott and other top Republican leaders in both the House of
Representatives and Senate run their own leadership political action
committees (PACs). Between January 1, 1997, and June 30, 1988,
Lott's New Republican Majority Fund gave 306,480 dollars to other
candidates.
</P>
<P>
"It's self-evident in the name of the PAC," said Lott spokesman
John Czwartacki. "Money in politics is not insignificant. It's an
important component to keeping and maintaining the Republican
majority."
</P>
<P>
Critics say these leadership PACs serve as another conduit for
special interest groups to aid lawmakers who control the
congressional agenda. Special interest committees are limited to
giving 10,000 dollars to a lawmaker's campaign, but they can give
another 10,000 dollars to the same lawmaker's leadership
committee.
</P>
<P>
"It's a very convenient way to double your contributions," said
Larry Makinson, director of the nonpartisan Center for Responsive
Politics, which tracks campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
From the start of 1997 through June 30 of this year, the top
four House Republican leaders -- Speaker Newt Gingrich, Majority
Leader Dick Armey, Majority Whip Tom DeLay and Conference Chairman
John Boehner -- reported raising 3.4 million dollars for their
leadership PACs, according to reports to the Federal Election
Commission.
</P>
<P>
During the same year and a half, the top four Senate Republican
leaders -- Lott, Assistant Majority Leader Don Nickles, Conference
Chairman Connie Mack and Conference Secretary Paul Coverdell --
took in 5.9 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Only two Democratic congressional leaders, both in the House,
have PACs. Minority Leader Dick Gephardt took in 686,485 dollars
over 18 months.
</P>
<P>
The top four House Republican leaders gave a total of 1.1
million dollars from their PACs to congressional candidates
between January 1, 1997, and June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers said they did not target specific industries as
donors to their PACs. At a time when Congress tackled proposals to
regulate managed care, the health care industry was a big giver.
</P>
<P>
Players in another major issue before Congress this year --
anti-smoking legislation -- also contributed thousands of dollars
to leadership PACs.

WASHINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Hurricane Bonnie was
downgraded to a tropical storm on Thursday as it dragged itself
slowly across eastern North Carolina, but pouring rain threatens
flooding in some eastern areas of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Since landing on the East Coast with 185 kph wind Wednesday
afternoon, Bonnie had quickly slowed to a crawl and gradually lost
strength. On Thursday morning, its sustained wind was down to 104
kph, below the minimum hurricane strength of 119 kph.
</P>

There were no reports of widespread damage, injuries or deaths,
but nearly 400,000 customers lost power in the South and North
Carolina, where about half a million people had evacuated before
the storm came.

Between Cape Fear and Wilmington, Bonnie's wind peeled the roof
off one wing of a hospital, forcing the evacuation of several
patients. A 40-foot section of windows was blown out of a
Wilmington high school.

<P>
Streets were filled with tree limbs and debris Thursday at
Morehead City, located on Bogue Sound on North Carolina's central

Severe flooding was threatened as the Neuse River was already
out of its banks Thursday morning at New Bern, near the central
North Carolina coast. Many streets were impassable and 770 people
were in shelters.
</P>

<HEADLINE> GCC Keen to Enhance Ties With Iran, Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) is keen to enhance ties with Iran on bases that would secure
stability in the Gulf region, it was learnt at a GCC foreign
ministerial meeting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, also Kuwaiti first
deputy prime minister, made the remark when chairing the opening
session of the 68th foreign ministers' meeting of the GCC, which
opened late Thursday in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to discuss a number
of regional and international issues.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Iranian government to give response to the
calls to resolve the dispute over the Greater and Lesser Tonbs,
and Abu Musa Island with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) peacefully
in accordance with the international laws, Kuwait's official news
agency Kuna reported.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and GCC countries used to be cool due to
political, religious and border disputes. A thaw has been seen
since the Iranian moderate president Mohammad Hatami took power a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sabah said the Gulf Arab bloc is following with
concern the development of the latest crisis between the United
Nations and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's suspension of cooperation with U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) on disarmament of Iraq violated the deal it signed with
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan last February, and the Security
Council resolutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East peace process, Sabah voiced GCC's great
concern over the peace process which has been deadlocked since
March 1997.
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve a lasting peace in the region, Israel
should withdraw from all occupied Arab territories, including
Jerusalem, the Golan Heights, south Lebanon and western Bekaa of
Lebanon in accordance with the Security Council resolutions and
land-for-peace formula, he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports by Kuna said that during the two-day meeting,
GCC foreign ministers would also review the growing issue of
terrorism, and would reiterate the initial stance of their
countries underlining the importance of international cooperation
to combat terrorism within the framework of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo crisis and the situations in Afghanistan, Somalia
and Kashmir would also be discussed.
</P>
<P>
On the sidelines of the ministerial meeting, GCC economic and
finance ministers would assess the latest Gulf efforts aimed at
establishing a custom union among the six member states, namely,
Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, they will brief the foreign ministers at a joint
session the outcome of their discussion on the tariffs
integration.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Reiterates Commitment to Cyprus Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. assured Cyprus Thursday
that the settlement of the Cyprus problem still remains a priority
in U.S. diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
The message was contained in a letter by James Steinberg,
President Bill Clinton's deputy assistant, to the ongoing
conference of Cypriot expatriates in Nicosia, a press release
issued at the conference said.
</P>
<P>
Steinberg said that "I can assure you that the Cyprus problem
remains a priority for President Clinton. He is very focused on
it, is very knowledgeable and puts in an enormous amount of time."
</P>
<P>
Clinton "is personally engaged in a search for a solution and
that's why he has engaged top diplomats such as Presidential
Emissary Richard Holbrooke and U.S. ambassador to Cyprus, Kenneth
Brill," Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is a major broker in the Cyprus peace talks, which
have been deadlocked since last summer when Turkish Cypriots opted
out of the U.N.-sponsored negotiations to protest against a
European Union decision to start accession talks with Cyprus, but
not their close ally Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke and Brill have visited Cyprus in the past few months,
but they failed to bring the two sides to back to the negotiating
table.
</P>
<P>
Steinberg stressed that "a commitment is needed by all of us to
achieve and negotiate a solution ... we will make every effort and
urge you to use your own efforts toward this end."

<HEADLINE> 3 Suspects Detained For Cape Town Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 27 (Xinhua) -- South African police
Thursday detained a man and two women for questioning in
connection with the terrible bombing in a Cape Town restaurant
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The three were arrested Thursday afternoon at the Cape Town
international airport where they have boarded an aircraft bound
for Cairo, Egypt, South African television reported.
</P>
<P>
Police said the arrest followed an anonymous tip-off.
</P>
<P>
A person was killed and 27 others injured when a bomb exploded
at the U.S.-franchised Planet Hollywood restaurant at the Cape
Town waterfront Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
It appears to be linked to U.S. strikes against alleged Moslem
terrorists in Sudan and Afghanistan last week.
</P>
<P>
A local vigilante group, People Against Gangsterism and Drugs
(Pagad), has confirmed that one of the suspects is its member.
</P>
<P>
Pagad, which is reported to be linked to Moslem
fundamentalists, was involved in continuous skirmishes with local
druglords. There were numerous bombings in recent months in Cape
Town due to their ongoing conflict.
</P>
<P>
Two of the three people, a man and a woman, were questioned by
a senior police officer who is also the investigating officer in
the bomb blast.
</P>
<P>
However, police denied that the detention of the three people
was linked with the bombing. They said there were discrepancies
in the three's travel documents and that they were being held
under the Aliens Control Act.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, President Nelson Mandela visited the bomb
scene. He repeated his condemnation of the bomber's "fully
cowardly deed".
</P>
<P>
A team of bomb disposal experts from the U.S. Federal Bureau
of Investigation (FBI) joined the South African police Thursday
morning in sifting through the debris at the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
The FBI agents came from Nairobi, where they have been probing
the recent twin blasts in U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi said the FBI
investigators will work closely with local police.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Announces Trial of Bombing Suspects for Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno announced Thursday that two suspects in the U.S. embassy
bombing in Nairobi, Kenya, had been brought to the United States
for trial.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, Reno said the United States had
mounted the most extensive overseas criminal investigation in its
history in the wake of the bomb attack that killed 258 people,
including 12 Americans, and injured well over 5,000.
</P>
<P>
"Today we have results. A great wrong has been done.... We are
not going to rest. We are not going to forget. We are going to
pursue every last murderer until justice is done," Reno told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The two suspects are Khalid Salim, whose real name is Mohammed
Rashid Daoud al-O'whali, and Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, both of whom
are said to be linked to Islamic militant financier Osama bin
Laden.
</P>
<P>
Salim arrived in New York Wednesday night, FBI Director Louis
Freeh said at the news conference. Odeh's arrival was not
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
Freeh said Salim was trained in a number of camps in
Afghanistan, affiliated with a militant group, Al Kheda, which was
led by bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
Mary Jo White, U.S. attorney, Southern District of New York,
told the news conference that a 14-count federal criminal
complaint was unsealed in New York, charging Salim for his
participation in the bombing of the U.S. embassy in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
"The defendant is charged with murder... conspiracy to commit
murder, and conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction against
the U.S. embassy in Kenya," White said.
</P>
<P>
Salim was arrested by the Kenyan authorities two days after the
embassy bombing, and then turned over to the FBI. He admitted to
have tossed a grenade at a guard stationed outside the U.S.
embassy at the start of the bombing attack.
</P>
<P>
Salim had been identified as being from Yemen but Yamen's
officials denied it.
</P>
<P>
Odeh was arrested on the day of the bombing in Karachi,
Pakistan, and has been held by Kenyan authorities since Aug. 14.
He was said to be either a Jordanian or Palestinian who obtained
Kenyan citizenship in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The complaints unsealed Thursday dealt only with Salim, and
details of what charges Odeh would face were not immediately
available.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan officials were said to be eager to seek justice for the
hundreds of Kenyan victims of the embassy bombing, but also wary
that a trial for an attack on a U.S. target in Kenya might invite
new terrorist assaults on Kenyan targets.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Manufacturer to Pack 400 Million Transistors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Researchers at a
Dallas-based company said Wednesday that they have developed
leading-edge semiconductor technology based on the smallest
announced transistors in the industry.
</P>
<P>
Featuring an effective channel length of 0.07 micron -- 1,000
times thinner than a human hair -- the transistors are so
miniscule that more than 400 million of them will fit onto a
single chip the size of a fingernail, said Texas Instrument in the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
"The ability to pack 400 million transistors on single,
low-voltage chip will push high-speed wireless and multimedia
communications far beyond the limits of today's technology," said
the new semiconductor company focused primarily on digital signal
processing solutions.
</P>
<P>
The process will enable operating frequencies exceeding
1-gigahertz with internal voltages as low as 1 volt, and support
input/output signaling environments of up to 3.3 volts.
</P>
<P>
The 0.07-micron transistors are designed for analog operating
as well as digital. As a result, the company will be able to
integrate mixed-signal functions along with high-speed digital
logic and cores from the very beginning of the process life cycle.
Products based on these chips will weigh less, shrink in size,
consume less power and be able to execute software much faster
than today's technology.
</P>
<P>
By using the chips, certain types of hearing aids may be
reduced to appliances that can be directly implanted in the inner
ear. Wireless telephones will be able to handle data and video as
well as voice. Modems operating on asymmetric digital subscriber
line (ADSL) will bring no-wait Internet access to consumers and
small businesses. Hard disk drives will read gigabits of data per
second for instantaneous access of large data bases.
</P>
<P>
The Texas manufacturer said that it plans to initiate designs
in the new 0.07-micron chip starting in the year 2000, with volume
production beginning in 2001.

<HEADLINE> Poll Shows No Erosion Sign Among Democratic Voters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Despite Democratic leaders'
worry that fallout from the Lewinsky affair could cause their
party's voters to stay home in the mid-term election in November,
a new poll shows no sign of erosion among Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we don't see any less interest in Democratic voters
with regard to turnout, even though the public is more critical of
Bill Clinton personally than it has been," said Andrew Kohut,
director of the Pew Research Center for the People &AMP; the Press,
which released its poll Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Pew poll, 61 percent say the Clinton-Lewinsky
controversy will not affect their vote in November.
</P>
<P>
Still, Republicans say they are seeing the first signs that the
president's problems could dampen Democratic turnout this fall.
</P>
<P>
"The Democrats are not as likely to be interested in the
election, they are less intense about voting and about supporting
their candidate," said Republican pollster Ed Goeas, citing his
detailed Republican survey of voter intensity. But Democratic
pollster Geoff Garin countered it's too early to get a significant
reading of such matters.
</P>
<P>
Much will depend on the contents of an expected report from
special prosecutor Kenneth Starr and the president's handling of
the situation, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The Pew poll suggested Democrats and Republicans are closely
matched in this fall's congressional elections, with Republicans
still having a slight edge among likely voters. And it reflected
no significant change in voter enthusiasm for either party since
June.
</P>
<P>
The president's job approval rating was steady at 62 percent,
and a majority of those surveyed would have an unfavorable view of
any member of Congress who voted for impeachment hearings for the
president.
</P>
<P>
But the poll had some potential trouble signs as well. A
majority said the controversy was severe enough that it was
interfering with Clinton's ability to run the country. And 43
percent said he did not have the respect he needs from officials
in Washington and world leaders to lead the country.
</P>
<P>
"This is potentially a sign of vulnerability," Kohut said,
noting those issues are related to Clinton's job and not to him
personally. "This could lead to a more serious loss of political
support than the feelings about whether he was telling the truth."
</P>
<P>
The phone survey of 1,001 adults taken from Friday through
Monday has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President to Visit Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
will visit Cyprus later this year, the first by an Israeli head of
state since the establishment of the diplomatic relationship in
1960.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the visit here Thursday, Israeli Ambassador to
Cyprus Shemi Tzur said during the visit, Weizman and his Cypriot
counterpart Glafcos Clerides will discuss how to upgrade relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Tzur did not dislose the exact date of the visit.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus-Israel relations could have never been termed as
warm until after Israel reached Oslo peace agreement with the
Palestinians in 1993 and triggered off a period of rapprochement
with its Arab and pro-Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus did not receive an Israeli foreign minister until July
1994 when Simon Peres' visit was described as a milestone in the
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that during Weizman's visit, Cyprus will raise
the issue of the close Israel-Turkey defense ties.
</P>
<P>
Turkey reached two defense-related agreements with Israel in
1996. Its close defense cooperation with the Jewish country has
triggered strong criticism from its neighbors, particularly Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkey took over the northern third of the Cypriot island in
1974 after a pro-Athens coup by Greek Cypriots and stations at
least 35,000 troops there to support a breakaway Turkish Cypriot
regime.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli leaders have explained that the defense ties with
Turkey are not directed against a third country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with Cypriot Minister of Commerce,
Industry and Tourism Nicos Rolandis, Tzur hoped that more Israeli
tourists will visit Cyprus this year.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, 40,000 Israelis visited
Cyprus in 1996, while the respective number for 1990 was only
8,400.

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Credit Bill Passed to Stimulate House Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian Government passed
on Thursday the bill of mortgage credit, to allow families with
low incomes to get advantageous credit-related building.
</P>
<P>
The newly adopted law indicates that the mortgage credit stands
for the credit granted by financial institutions specializing in
developing, buying, rehabilitation and consolidation of the
buildings for dwelling, commercial and industrial purposes.
</P>
<P>
The mortgage credit can be allotted for at least 10 years for
natural persons and 5 years for legal persons, deadlines to be
extended at request. Any building for which a credit is requested
can be mortgaged along with the plot it is to stand on. In this
case, the mortgage on the plot of land can gradually pass to the
building, during construction.
</P>
<P>
According to the law, the credits can turn into mortgages, if
the customers fail to meet the terms for paying the agreed-on
debts the creditor is entitled to take over the building.

ANKARA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Affected by the economic crisis
in Russia and new taxes, the Istanbul Stock Exchange National-100
Index dropped a record 13.58 percent to 2,603.99 points on
Thursday, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The index fell as low as 2,580 points during Thursday
afternoon trading, and later made only a slight recovery.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the index tumbled 255.99 points, or 7.95 percent,
to close at 2,997.25 points.
</P>
<P>
Turkish investors fear that scores of Turkish companies which
trade with Russia will be severely damaged by Moscow's economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Istanbul stock market is especially sensitive to Russia's
financial situation due to close economic link between Turkey and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Turkish brokers said that the national-100 index plunged also
because of a withholding tax on interbanking money transactions,
a 12 percent tax on banking deposits and new charges on dividends
and share earnings.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted Turkish Minister of Finance and Customs
Zekeriya Temizel as saying that "capital may flee to tax
shelters. There is nothing to stop this, but everyone should know
that the return of this capital from tax havens to Turkey will be
costly."

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses Weapons Inspector of Creating "Theory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraq accused on Thursday U.N.
weapons inspector Scott Ritter of fabricating "the theory of
concealment" that had sparked a weapons inspection crisis in
February.
</P>
<P>
The government spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said that the theory was prepared by Israeli and American
intelligence agencies with the aim to push for an open-ended
course of "inspection, investigation and suspicion at all that
Iraq says, does and achieves."
</P>
<P>
The accusation of Iraqi government came after Ritter, who is
called by Iraq "American spy" and blocked access to some
inspection sites, resigned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"This American officer had been the spearhead in implementing
the biggest U.S. lie of Iraq's concealment of proscribed weapons,
materials and documents at presidential sites," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The presidential incident has led to a standoff between the
U.N. weapons inspectors and Iraq, in which the U.S. and Britain
massed a large force in the Gulf to force Baghdad to open all its
presidential palaces for weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was defused after U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
reached an agreement with Baghdad to allow access to all the
presidential palaces.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Special Committee (UNSCOM), which has taken charge of
weapons inspections in Iraq since 1991 after the Gulf War, set off
by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, has long accused Iraq of concealing
banned weapons and documents and asked it to open all suspected
sites to weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
But Iraq, which claims that it has eliminated all banned
weapons in line with relevant U.N. resolutions, has repeatedly
criticized the UNSCOM for serving the U.S. to attempt to prolong
the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions will not be lifted until the UNSCOM certifies
that Iraq is rid of all banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
But the weapons inspections were bogged down again after Baghdad
suspended cooperation with UNSCOM and the International Atomic
Energy Agency on August 5.

<HEADLINE> Shares Fall Sharply Across Europe With Growing Panic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Stock markets nosedived across
Europe Thursday, bowing to the weight of worsening crisis in
Russia and a general panic sweeping global markets.
</P>
<P>
While battered Western European markets closed with losses
between 3 and 6 percent, some bourses in Eastern Europe went down
by more 10 percent, as panicking investors rushed to unload
stocks. Hungary plunged 14 percent, Warsaw 6 percent, and Prague
slid 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Fears of global economic recession are growing as financial
authorities such as the IMF, used to fire-fighting one country's
crisis at a time, are being overwhelmed by the scale of capital
flight from emerging markets, according to market analysts.
</P>
<P>
Russia's central bank suspended foreign exchange trade of the
rouble on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange Thursday after
opening trade showed a big drop was in store, intensifying
European investors' fears over what would be the worst to come.
</P>
<P>
"There's no obvious crisis management situation to deal with
this," observed Robin Marshall, head of research at U.S. bank
Chase in London. "There are a million investors all with positions
and the capital pressures are just too hard to resist."
</P>
<P>
Those who had hoped that Wall Street's usual optimism would
bail out shares elsewhere were disappointed to find that Wall
Street weighed in with an early 325 point loss, almost 4 percent,
which was considered to breach key technical support points if
maintained to the close.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Eastern Europe, however, an absence of buyers rather
than a weight of selling was evident in the Western bourses.
</P>
<P>
London's blue chip shares suffered another session of heavy
selling, with another 51 billion U.S. dollars wiped off share
values. The FTSE 100 lost 176.9 points to end the day at 5,368.5,
but finishing clear of the 5,353.5 session low.
</P>
<P>
Dealers warned that there were plenty more profits for
investors still to take. Volume improved on recent levels, with
over 800m shares traded by the close.
</P>
<P>
Frankfurt shares lost 4.5 percent in electronic trade on the
Xetra DAX, once again worried about the exposure of German banks
to Russian debt. Paris lost 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Swiss shares were hit hard again after Wednesday's big losses,
losing 5.1 percent and dropping through chart support at the key
7,100 level on the Swiss Market Index. In Madrid, fears for Latin
America dragged the market down 5.9 percent by the close.
</P>
<P>
Other markets were similarly afflicted, with Athens ATX falling
5 percent, Stockholm's OMX index 4.15 percent down, Milan's Mibtel
losing 4.4 percent, Portugal's PSI20 dropping 6.13 percent, Oslo's
Total Index sliding 3.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
But, not everyone believes the end of the world is nigh. What
may yet be called a black Thursday by many was a ray of hope for
market contrarians.
</P>
<P>
Reuters quoted Dain Rauscher's Robert Dickey as saying that the
sense of panic entering the market was one of the signs
technicians look for as a harbinger of a market bottom.
</P>
<P>
"I feel pretty good we're making a bottom, and the fact that no
one believes me reinforces that," he said. "This is the way
bottoms are formed."
