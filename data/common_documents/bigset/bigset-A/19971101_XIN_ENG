<HEADLINE> Russian Parliament Approves Chemical Arms Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Russia's lower house of
parliament today voted to approve an international convention
banning the development, production and use of chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
Russia is the world's largest stockpiler of chemical weapons,
with stocks of about 40,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma voted 288-75 for the 1993 Chemical Weapons
Convention, which has already been signed by more than 160
countries. Two deputies abstained.
</P>
<P>
The draft is yet to be approved by the upper house, the
Federation Council, and President Boris Yeltsin. Yeltsin has said
he supports the convention.
</P>
<P>
The Duma, concerned about the cost of destroying the chemical
arms, postponed the hearings on the convention in April. The Duma
failed to ratify the convention until today, although Russia was
among the first to sign the convention.
</P>
<P>
Signatories to the convention must destroy their chemical
weapons and production facilities within 10 years and provide
detailed information about production and export of listed
chemicals that could be used to make them.
</P>
<P>
Signatories are also required to open their chemical plants to
the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)
for both routine and short-notice inspections.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Promotes Specialized Goods Procuration Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing today
called for the development of commodity procurator services in a
bid to deepen the reform of the circulation system of goods.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national conference, Li, also a member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) Central Committee, said that to expand procuration
of goods will be the goal of China's circulation system in the
course of establishing a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
The modern method of circulating commodities will help make the
country's economy more specialized, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993 piloting work has been done among procurators who
take charge of gathering production materials for industrial
enterprises. Since 1995 some 100 manufacturers and wholesale
enterprises have experimented with using agents to sell steel and
cars.
</P>
<P>
The commodities procuration business is new in China, and
problems related to credit, funds, taxes and settlement should be
handled well, the vice-premier said.
</P>
<P>
He required procurators and their employers to share both
benefits and risks by taking into consideration their overall
interests.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Implement UN Sanctions Against UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 31 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will take
all necessary steps to ensure the strict implementation of UN
sanctions against Angola's former rebel UNITA, the South African
Foreign Ministry said in statement today.
</P>
<P>
"Under international law, South Africa, as a member of the
United Nations, is obliged to adhere to the provisions of
Resolution 1127 (1997)," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The UN resolution calls for travel and diplomatic sanctions
against the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The sanction measures include: the prevention of entry into or
transit through the territories of UN member states for all
senior UNITA officials and their adult immediate family members,
immediate closure of UNITA's overseas offices in UN member
states, prohibition of the supply of any aircraft or aircraft
components to UNITA, Denial of takeoff, landing and overflight
rights to any aircraft entering or leaving Angola, except those
recognized by the Security Council committee.
</P>
<P>
South Africa asked its citizens to respect these measures,
saying that all violations would be dealt with severely by the UN
and the South African authorities.
</P>
<P>
The statement said South Africa is committed to peace in the
sub-region and believes that the imposition of sanctions will go
a long way to ensure that all parties, particularly the UNITA,
will continue with the implementation of the provisions of the
Lusaka Protocol.
</P>
<P>
UNITA and the Angolan government signed the Lusaka Protocol, a
cease-fire agreement, in November 1994, but the implementation of
it was far from satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
The UN Security Council adopted a resolution Wednesday to
impose the sanctions against UNITA as a punishment to its failure
to comply with the protocol and relevant UN resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani: US Anti-Iran Policies Doomed to Fail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian President Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani said here today that the current anti-Iran
policies of the United States are doomed to fail as before.
</P>
<P>
"Washington is going to absurd lengths to mobilize the devil's
army against Iran, but this time, too, it is doomed to fail as it
did earlier on," Rafsanjani, who now heads the advisory State
Exigencies Council, said while addressing Friday prayer
congregation at Tehran University.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. was now trying to dissuade Russia and some other
countries from cooperating with Iran, but Washington's political
plots would not pay off, he said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that "the U.S. adventurism in the Persian Gulf
will have unavoidable impact on oil prices."
</P>
<P>
He accused Washington of not backing away from its schemes
against Iran even in the face of the threat of oil price rise in
the international market.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., accusing Iran of supporting terrorism and seeking
nuclear weapons, imposed economic sanctions against Iran since
June, 1995, and warned to punish foreign companies cooperating
with Iran in the field of oil industry.
</P>
<P>
At today's congregation, Secretary of Iran's Supreme Council of
National Security Hassan Rowhani also blasted U.S. policies
against Iran.
</P>
<P>
"Washington and the Israeli regime are now publishing
scandalous lies about Iran to divert international attention from
what they are doing in the Middle East," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rowhani predicted that it was unlikely that the U.S. or Israel
might want to go much further in their enmity with Iran, warning
that "should they be tempted to antagonize Iran, the people and
the armed forces of the country would give them a crushing
response."
</P>
<P>
Since Iranian students seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran nearly
18 years ago, Washington has been striving to isolate Iran, but it
has failed in all its schemes, he concluded.

<HEADLINE> US Economy Grows at 3.5 Percent Rate in 3rd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy expanded at
an annual rate of 3.5 percent in the third quarter of this year
resulting from strong consumer spending and business investment,
U.S. commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate in the gross domestic product (GDP) -- the sum
of all goods and services produced within U.S. borders -- was even
better than the healthy 3.3 percent rate in the second quarter.
The U.S. economy gained at a torrid 4.9 percent annual rate in the
first three months.
</P>
<P>
The report said that consumer spending, which accounts for
two-third of U.S. economic activities, grew at a 5.7 percent
annual rate in July-September quarter, the strongest since the
first quarter of 1992. It compared sharply with a scant 0.9
percent rate in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Business investment increased at a strong 18.7 percent annual
rate in the third quarter, the fastest increase in 13 years.
Investment in new equipment slowed only slightly from the rapid 23
percent in the second quarter rate to 22.1 percent. But investment
in new buildings picked up sharply, rising at a 10.1 percent rate
after falling at a 4.7 percent pace.
</P>
<P>
Government spending grew at a 1 percent rate as 2.2 percent
growth in state and local spending offset a 1.2 percent drop in
federal spending.
</P>
<P>
Exports advanced at a 5.6 percent rate but were overpowered by
14 percent import growth.
</P>
<P>
The various changes put the economy's output in the third
quarter at a seasonally and inflation-adjusted 7.22 trillion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, inflation in the U.S. has consistently improved over
the year. A price measure tied to the GDP rose at an annual rate
of 1.4 percent in the third quarter, comparing with a 2.4 percent
rate in the first quarter and 1.8 percent in the April-June
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Normally, a rapid growth like the pace in this year would
result in an growing inflation pressure and draw
interest-rate increases from the U.S. Federal Reserve. But
analysts believe the recent turmoil in the stock market has lead
to a sharp decline of consumers' wealth and it will help slow
growth next year.

CANBERRA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Colin McRae of Scotland came
back to the world championship after he took the second-day lead
on Friday in the Australia Rally in Perth.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 world champion overcame front-end problems to move up
into the first place overall with a time of one hour, 32 minutes

<HEADLINE> '98 China City and Country Tour to Be Staged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Life in ancient and modern
cities and China's splendid rural scenery will be the major themes
promoted by the country's tourism industry to attract
international visitors in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"By staging the '98 China City and Country Tour, the industry
is expected to lure 55 million overseas and 680 million domestic
tourists next year," announced Tong Hualing, a spokesman of the
China National Tourism Administration (CNTA).
</P>
<P>
The country's tourism revenue in 1998 is estimated to hit 12
billion US dollars of foreign exchange from overseas travellers
and 200 billion yuan (24.096 billion US dollars) from domestic
travelers, Tong told a reporters at a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the tourism sector will concentrate on two series of
tourist programs: one focuses on changes in the prominent ancient
Chinese historic cities, and the other highlights the idyllic
country life and rural scenery, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Major events scheduled for 1998 include a grand ceremony to be
held on January 1 in Hanshan Temple in Suzhou, known as the "city of
Chinese gardens," to unveil the activities for the year.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Shanghai, China's largest metropolis, will
host a ceremony welcoming the first batch of overseas tourists for
the new year.
</P>
<P>
On September 27, celebrations marking the World Tourism Day
will be staged in Chongqing, China's largest municipality in terms
of population. In October, an international tourism fair will be
held in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The tourism sector has also prepared 23 festive activities in
major tourist cities across the country to display the country's
colorful and rich lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the year, the first batch of "Outstanding Tourist
Cities" will be selected as a finale for the year-long event.
</P>
<P>
"We have already launched several tourism theme years, and they
have proved to be successful, since they have been designed
according to the demand of the market," according to Yang Wenzhen,
director of CNTA's Marketing Department.
</P>
<P>
"I want to emphasize that this is the first time China has
promoted a country tour -- something which has already become a
fad in the international market," she told the press conference.
</P>
<P>
China plans to promote an ecology-friendly tour in 1999, and the
theme for 2000 will be "China Century Tour."

<HEADLINE> US Fist Lady Urges N.Irish Rivals to Drink Tea Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. First Lady Hillary Clinton
on Friday urged the rival groups in Northern Ireland to sit
together for tea and for peace.
</P>
<P>
"Now finally we have men and women around a table. I hope they
have lots of tea," Clinton told a packed hall at the University of
Ulster near Belfast.
</P>
<P>
But she acknowledged: "There will be bumps on the road and
there will be people who want to smash the tea pot rather than sit
around a table and discuss them."
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived at Belfast this morning from Dublin where she
held meetings with Irish leaders.
</P>
<P>
She also paid heartfelt tribute to a Northern Irish peace
campaigner, Joyce McCartan, who died last year at the age of 68.
</P>
<P>
Clinton met McCartan, a Roman Catholic grandmother, two years
ago on a heady visit she and President Bill Clinton made to
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
McCartan welcomed Hillary Clinton to the tiny cafe she ran
where women from both sides of the sectarian divide could meet and
share their troubles.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland was at an even more hopeful moment now than it
was two years ago, with leaders of both the Catholic and
Protestant communities taking part in talks on the future of the
province sponsored by London and Dublin, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is due to visit a youth project during the afternoon
before flying to London, where she is expected to spend the
weekend with British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Announce Breakthrough In Nuclear Fusion Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Scientists at the Joint European
Torus (JET) announced here today they had created new world
records in imitating the energy-producing process of the Sun. The
breakthrough will make it possible for mankind to harness a safe,
clean and endless source of energy.
</P>
<P>
JET broke the world record for power fusion on September 22, by
using the deuterium-tritium fuel mixture. The power output peaked
at 12.9 megawatts and remained above 10 megawatts for half a
second, announced JET Director Dr Martin Keilhacker at a press
conference in London.
</P>
<P>
It also broke the world record for the ratio of fusion power
produced to the net input power with 0.6 in the same experiment,
he added.
</P>
<P>
If the ratio is above 1, the fusion will not only be maintained
by the energy it releases, but also output net energy.
</P>
<P>
In a previous experiment, JET created a new energy fusion world
record of 14 megajoules in three seconds with an average output
power above 4 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
In November 1991, for the first time, controlled fusion
power was produced by JET with output power peaking at 1.7
megawatts. Since then, the US Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor has
produced 10.7 megawatts of fusion power at a ratio of 0.28.
</P>
<P>
JET, based at Abingdon, Oxfordshire, Britain, is the largest
and most successful fusion experiment in the world. Construction
began in 1978 and the project has been operational since
1983.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Urged to Boost Regional Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe should strengthen its
foothold in regional trade to brace for an impending harsh
trading environment brought about by the expiry of the Lome
Convention, a local trade promotion organisation said today.
</P>
<P>
Zimtrade said in its New Quarterly magazine that Zimbabwe had
to increase its exports to the Southern Africa Development
Community (SADC) and Common Market for East and Southern Africa
(COMESA) regions and find new trade partners.
</P>
<P>
It is certain that the country will have trading partners to
fall on when the current Lome IV Convention expires in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Zimtrade said although Zimbabwe had trade agreements with
Botswana, Malawi, Namibia and South Africa, progress in that
direction had been slow with other countries such as Zambia and
Mauritius which ''happen to be very important regional trading
partners."
</P>
<P>
''Zimbabwe must work hard to facilitate negotiations aimed at
establishing the SADC trade protocol earlier than the eight years
stipulated,'' Zimtrade said, adding that the country should also
ratify the COMESA treaty.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to make COMESA work have been hampered by the fact
that Zimbabwe still has not ratified the treaty, it said.
</P>
<P>
The country should also hunt for niche overseas markets such
as Japan, the Pacific and America, it added.

<HEADLINE> France Seeks to Avoid Escalation in Iraq-U.S. Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 31 (Xinhua) -- France is seeking to avoid an
escalation of the tension between Iraq and the United States
caused by the Iraqi decision to expel American experts from the
United Nations special commission in charge of supervising
disarmament in Iraq (UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said that
France, together with its allies, is looking for "all ways
allowing the appeasement and for dialogue to prevail over the
logic of confrontation."
</P>
<P>
On refusal by Iraq to allow two American experts to enter Iraqi
territory, Rummelhardt said that the measure is
"incontradiction" with the U.N. Security Council resolution
which gives UNSCOM the right to supervise disarmament of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We profoundly regret that this incident took place several
hours after the adoption of a declaration by the Security Council
of the United Nations" which hardens sanctions against Iraq, said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
France, together with China and Russia, abstained from the
resolution proposed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
"France is ready to act in the sense of appeasement. It is
keeping contact with its partners at the Security Council, notably
Russia, the United States, Britain and the secretary general of
the United Nations," said Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is "essential" for Iraq to show its good will
and readiness to conform to its international obligations.

<HEADLINE> Constitutional Crisis Ends in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistan government led
by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif today averted a constitutional
breakdown in the country as it yielded to the pressure of Chief
Justice Sajjad Ali Shah by approving the appointment of five
Supreme Court judges.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed with the Supreme Court on the elevation of the five
judges in accordance with the recommendations of Chief Justice
Sajjad Ali Shah," Sharif announced in a speech telecast nationwide
from the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
A proposed amendment relating to the judiciary and the powers
of the chief justice has also been postponed, he announced.
</P>
<P>
The government's retreat came two days after the Supreme Court
invoked Article 190 of the constitution asking President Farooq
Leghari to announce the appointment of the five judges as the
government had failed to do the same as per recommendations of the
chief justice.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, who came to power in mid-February this year, had
earlier vowed to fix judges' strength through the parliament while
Sajjad indicated in public statements that any move by the
parliament could be struck down if made without consulting him.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the National Assembly passed a resolution
claiming supremacy of the parliament in the legislative process.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Set to Use Azt against HIV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe is to introduce the
American-developed Azt drug to reduce the risk of mother-to-child
transmission of HIV among pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
While logistics are still being worked out, a pilot project to
be largely financed by the government is expected to begin soon,
National AIDS Coordination Program Director Everisto Marowa said
today.
</P>
<P>
Marowa said the pilot project will not be testing the
efficiency of Zidovudine, but attempting to make the drug ''apply
to the local context''.
</P>
<P>
''The efforts which the Ministry of Health and Child welfare
is engaged in relate at trying to look at feasible intervention
which is put in place to reduce mother-to-child transmission,''
said Marowa.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that at least 10 percent of Zimbabwe's 12.4
million population is infected with the aids-causing hiv virus.
</P>
<P>
Killing some 500 people each week, aids-related illnesses are
affecting the reproductive age-group most.
</P>
<P>
Azt, said Marowa, would not be cheap, but measures were being
worked out to ensure that those who cannot afford are not denied
the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
Counselling will form a major component of the Azt Program in
order to give potential users information before critical choices
are made.
</P>
<P>
The Azt is normally used by HIV positive women during
pregnancy and delivery and by the baby for at least six weeks.

<HEADLINE> Reactions to UN Sanctions Against Angolan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Concerned parties to the
Angolan peace process have reacted to the United Nations Security
Council resolution which calls for sanctions against Angola's
oppositlion the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA), local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
An official with the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's office
said in New York today that the UN sanctions on the UNITA passed
on Wednesday did not place obstacles before possible dialogue
between the UN and the UNITA.
</P>
<P>
He added that the UNITA can have dialogue with the UN at any
time through the UN Observers Mission based in Angola.
</P>
<P>
In line with this spirit, the UN special representative based
in Angola Blondin Beye today headed for the UNITA headquarters in
central Angola to brief UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi on the UN
resolution, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued last evening, the Angolan government
urged the UNITA to fully implement the Lusaka peace agreement and
complete all the tasks under the UN resolution to end sanctions
against it.
</P>
<P>
The government reiterated that it is willing to have "serious
and sincere" dialogue with the UNITA to realize reconciliation
among all Angolans.
</P>
<P>
Joao Lourenco, Press Secretary of the ruling People's Movement
for the Liberation of Angola, told reporters today that the UN
Security Council fulfilled its promise to impose sanctions on the
UNITA which did not fully implement the Lusaka peace agreement in
time.
</P>
<P>
The UN Security Council imposed air and travel sanctions
against the UNITA and ordered that all its overseas offices be
closed.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonen Junta to Execute Robbers: Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, October 31 (Xinhua) -- There were persistent reports
in the Sierra Leonean capital today that a special military
tribunal has ordered the execution of seven soldiers and 10
civilians to be carried out on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A series of armed robberies have gripped the capital in the
last three weeks with attacks on the residence of the delegate of
the European Union (EU) and the EU office as well as a
polyclinic run by the Iranian government in the west of the city.
</P>
<P>
Many of the robbers caught were civilians armed with
sophisticated weapons and wearing military fatigues.
</P>
<P>
One week ago, 10 soldiers were executed by firing squad after
a special military tribunal found them guilty of murder, looting
and robbery with aggravation.
</P>
<P>
Head of State of the military government, Major Johnny Paul
Koroma has vowed to execute all convicted armed robbers, saying
that their actions are aimed at "tarnishing the image of his
government."
</P>
<P>
"We will never accept that and they would pay the price of
their actions. Peaceful citizens have the right to sleep in
peace at night," Koroma added.

NEW DELHI, October 31 (Xinhua) -- India and Belgium today
signed two agreements aimed at promoting bilateral trade and
economic cooperation, particularly in the fields of textiles,
garments, leather and engineering goods.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Calls for More Efforts for Southern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 31 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today appealed to southern African countries to
redouble their efforts for the development of the region, the
South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Now that the countries in the region were finally rid of the
cruel and crippling destabilization of the previous South African
regime, they could turn their attention to the task of developing
the region, Mandela said in Maseru at the coronation of Lesotho's
King Letsie III.
</P>
<P>
Southern African countries could concentrate on placing the
region in its rightful position among the world's nations, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"As a region, we shall vigorously defend peace and stability
that we have all worked so hard to achieve. We shall strive to
find creative ways to invite investment, boost trade and advance
manufacturing," the president said.
</P>
<P>
While reserving and revering their traditions, he said,
nations in the region would use their centuries-old experience
"so that our peoples have access to the resources, education and
technology that we need for success in the new age."
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the shift to development in the region has
actually already begun.
</P>
<P>
All the 12 Southern African Development Community (SADC)
members have registered positive growth, with some countries
recording growth rates higher than 5 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, much more still needs to be done.
</P>
<P>
"Hunger, starvation, illiteracy and unemployment may not seem
as powerful as the enemies of the past, but we know that they are
equally destructive and just as painful to our people."
</P>
<P>
In order to better the lives of southern Africa's people, the
SADC is committed to redoubling its efforts at economic
integration and cooperation for development.
</P>

Moshoeshoe the Great was killed in a road accident in January

<HEADLINE> No Breakthrough at U.N. Climate Conference in Bonn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The last preparatory meeting for
December's Kyoto conference on global climate change ended today
in Bonn with no breakthrough in setting greenhouse gas emission
limits.
</P>
<P>
About 150 officials from all over the world attended the
meeting which lasted 10 days. The United States was again blamed
for the lack of progress.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton proposed to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012,
with further reductions over the following five-year period.
</P>
<P>
His proposal falls short of targets urged by the European Union
(EU), which favor reductions of 15 percent below 1990 levels by
the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
U.S. emissions are already 8.3 percent higher than 1990 levels.
</P>
<P>
With only 5 percent of the world's population, the United
States now produces 25 percent of the world's greenhouse
emissions, according to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
As host of the Kyoto ministerial meeting, Japan has suggested
that a five percent decline from the 1990 levels as a base for
reducing emissions, with individual countries being allowed to set
their own targets.
</P>
<P>
The proposals of the United States and Japan were
"insufficient", said German environment minister Angela Merkel,
who expected further negotiations before the Kyoto summit.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot afford failure at Kyoto", said Merkel, adding that
she would visit Japan next weekend for further talks.

<P>
HARARE, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Regional Office for Africa
(AFRO) of the World Health Organization (WHO) has been
temporarily relocated to Harare following deteriorating security
situation in Brazaville, Congo, an AFRO official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The AFRO office team, led by Regional Director Ibrahim Samba,
arrived here a few days ago to set up office at the University of
Zimbabwe's Medical School.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference today, Samba could not say for how long
his office would operate in this southern African country,
emphasizing the move would not be permanent for political,
geographic and sentimental reasons.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot abandon Congo because of the situation which can
happen in any country. We have been there since 1953 and we shall
go back when the situation improves," he said.
</P>
<P>
Congo was favored as the regional head-office because of its
central location in the central African belt of the continent.
</P>
<P>
Fighting broke out in Congo a few weeks ago after former
president Dennis Sassou Nguesso launched a takeover and ousted
President Lissouba.
</P>
<P>
Samba said it is becoming increasingly difficult for the
regional office to operate from a war zone. The Gambian national
is competing the post of WHO director-general.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Military Wing Threatens News Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Qassam military wing of
the Islamic militant group Hamas threatened today it will continue
terrorist attacks against Israel unless Israel agrees to its
demand of releasing Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Hamas said that Israel has one last chance
before it carried out what it termed the "greatest operation" with
all force and determination.
</P>
<P>
"Our message to the enemy government is that our troops of
martyrs are waiting for their turn in the battle ... you have a
last chance before executing the greatest operation which will not
be stopped unless you immediately meet our just demands," it said.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,500 Palestinian prisoners remain in Israeli jails. Under
the Oslo peace accords between Israel and the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA), the Jewish state is slated to release them by
stages. But since the Israeli-Palestinian peace process was bogged
down in March, the release of prisoners has also been frozen.
</P>
<P>
Hamas, which claimed responbility for the last two suicide
bombing attacks in Jerusalem, said its members would suspend
attacks against Israeli civilians if Israel declare its full
commitment to stop its attacks on Palestinian civilians, including
demolition of houses and confiscation of land.
</P>
<P>
Since Hamas' spiritual leader and founder Sheikh Ahmad Yassin
was freed by Israel and returned to Gaza early this month, it was
the first time that the Qassam military wing made clear its
rejection to any truce without concessions from Israel.
</P>
<P>
In response to the statement, Israel security sources said
that the alert against Hamas terrorist attacks from late
September is continuing. They noted that there is nothing new in
Hamas demand that Israel free its activists.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a senior Palestinian official
disclosed Thursday that the PNA is negotiating a deal with Hamas
to temporarily stop terrorism against Israel.
</P>
<P>
The official said that in return for the halt the PNA will
release Hamas prisoners held in its jails and allow institutions
affiliated with the organization to reopen.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Pakistan's Constitutional Crisis Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistan government led
by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif today averted a constitutional
breakdown in the country as it yielded to the pressure of Chief
Justice Sajjad Ali Shah by approving the appointment of five
Supreme Court judges.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed with the Supreme Court on the elevation of the five
judges according to the recommendations of Chief Justice Sajjad
Ali Shah," Sharif announced in a speech telecast nationwide from
the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
A proposed amendment relating to the judiciary and powers of
the chief justice has also been postponed by the National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The government's retreat came two days after the Supreme Court
invoked Article 190 of the constitution asking President Farooq
Leghari to announce the appointment of the five judges as the
government had failed to do the same as per recommendations of the
chief justice.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly, in which Sharif's party the Muslim
League enjoys a two-thirds majority, passed a resolution on
Wednesday claiming supremacy of the parliament in the legislative
process.
</P>
<P>
The government's latest decision was aimed at putting an end to
the state of confrontation in the best interest of the country,
Federal Minister Chaudary Nisar Ali said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
On August 19, Chief Justice Sajjad recommended to the
government names of the five judges for appointment to the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
However, Sharif had been resisting the elevation of two of the
five judges and had even tried to abolish the five vacant posts in
the apex court.
</P>
<P>
During the 74-day-long standoff between the government and the
judiciary, Sharif, who came to power in mid-February this year,
had vowed to fix judges' strength through the parliament while
Sajjad indicated in public statements that any move by the
parliament could be struck down if made without consulting him.
</P>
<P>
However, experts here were quick to note that, with the
resolution of the government-judiciary tussle, a petition, which
was filed with the Supreme Court and seeks to restore the
president's power to dismiss a government, has assumed a great
significance.
</P>
<P>
Though the deadlock is over, the apex court might revert to its
earlier views in a judgment that such presidential powers are a
safety valve against martial law and should therefore stay, the
experts said.
</P>
<P>
The president's power to dissolve an elected government was
abolished by the parliament in early April through the 13th
Constitutional Amendment.

<HEADLINE> Gulf Countries Reject Foreign Interference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The six-member Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) today accused foreign interference in
their internal affairs, the Wam news agency of the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) reported.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued today, GCC cultural ministers criticized
"the negative attitudes" of "certain foreign organizations"
towards the judicial systems of their countries, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers said the organizations had blatantly interfered in
GCC countries' internal affairs and violated their sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The statement, short of naming the targets, was believed to be
directed against the European Parliament (EP) which criticized the
UAE and Bahrain of violating human rights in dealing with
criminals.
</P>
<P>
The EP issued a statement late September attacking the UAE for
failing to give two murderers rights to defense before executing
them.
</P>
<P>
The UAE contended that the two convicted, an Iranian and a UAE
national who had perpetrated serial murder, kidnaping, armed
robbery and larceny, were executed according to law.
</P>
<P>
It called on the EP to "view what is going on in the UAE with a
right eye."
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the EP blasted Bahrain for hashly suppressing
opposition groups, which it claimed violated human rights.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain said that the EP's criticism was based on false claims
made by an opposition group in an attempt to distort its
reputation and return the accusation that the EP failed to
differentiate between political opposition and terrorist
groups.
</P>
<P>
The GCC includes six Arab countries of the UAE, Bahrain,
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Qatar.

<HEADLINE> Steel, Aluminium Plants to be Built in UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) has planned to set up a steel plant and an aluminium factory
as part of its efforts to diversify the economy, the Wam news
agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The steel project due to be launched before the end of this
year will cost around 75 million U.S. dollars, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
It has been designed to produce annually 500,000 tonnes of
steel, which are not only able to meet the needs of the domestic
market, but also for export, it added.
</P>
<P>
The aluminium smelter, which will cost 350 million dollars, has
an annual capacity of 220,000 tonnes each year.
</P>
<P>
Western firms are vying for the construction contracts, which
will be awarded within months, according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
The two projects will be based in Tawila, an emerging key
industrial center near the capital Abu Dhabi.
</P>
<P>
UAE's economy is seriously reliant on oil exports. Oil earnings
account for nearly two thirds of its total revenues each year.
</P>
<P>
To diminish the effect of oil price fluctuations, UAE has been
making efforts since late 1980s to diversify its economy by
developing different industrial sectors.

<HEADLINE> IMF Initiates $23 Billion Rescue Package for Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Michel Camdessus, Managing
Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today announced
a 23 billion U.S. dollar emergency rescue package for Indonesia,
second largest in fund history.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus also told a press conference that Australia, China,
Hong Kong SAR of China, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and the United
States stood ready to provide additional billions of dollars if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his strong endorsement for a program of
macroeconomic adjustment and structural reform announced by the
Indonesian authorities earlier today. "There measures should
restore confidence in the Indonesian economy and contribute to the
stabilization of regional financial markets," Camdessus noted.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. contribution will be 3 billion dollars in loans from
the Exchange Stabilization Fund, the same source that the U.S.
President Bill Clinton used in early 1995 to help defuse the
Mexican financial crisis after its currency collapsed.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government, which did not come up to play a major role
in a 17.2 billion dollars bailout package assembled in August for
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said that the IMF will provide the largest share of
the package for Indonesia, 10 billion dollars, with another 4.5
billion dollars coming from the World Bank. The Asian Development
Bank will provide 3.5 billion dollars and 5 billion dollars will
come from Indonesia's own assets.
</P>
<P>
The IMF chief termed the plan as "the first line of defense" to
support Indonesia's economy and said other countries would provide
back-up if 23 billion dollars proves inadequate.
</P>
<P>
In exchange, Indonesia agreed to economic reforms, including
closing down unhealthy banks, reducing food subsidies, removing
trade barriers and ending monopolies.
</P>
<P>
However, Camdessus said at present, he did not want other
countries to tell the precise number of assistance for Indonesia,
but "solidarity" behind the rescue initiatives.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Denies Alleged Support to S. Leone Junta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Liberia today denied the
startling claim that it helped bring arms into neighboring Sierra
Leone in support of the military junta which is not serious about
a peace plan to restore civil rule.
</P>
<P>
"The Liberian government has no way in supporting or providing
military support to the junta in Sierra Leone," said Information
Minister Joe Mulbah, according to the British Broadcasting
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Ben Williams, an aide of deposed President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah,
claimed on Thursday that Liberia was assisting the junta in
bringing in truckloads of arms into Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The junta would probably use the arms to attack the west
African peace-keeping force (ECOMOG) which is in Sierra Leone to
enforce sanctions imposed by the United Nations and Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS), he said.
</P>
<P>
Williams accused the Liberian government of "working with the
junta to undermine the peace plan".
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS foreign ministers signed an agreement with the junta
last week in Conakry, Guinea on peaceful resolution to the crisis
in Sierra Leone which was triggered off by the May 25 coup that
overthrew Kabbah's legitimate government.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the military government will hand over power
to Kabbah on April 22, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The arms and fuel embargo on the junta will remain effective
during the transition period.
</P>
<P>
Liberia is one of the ECOWAS Committee of Five participating
in peace talks with the junta.
</P>
<P>
The country is actively involved in the Sierra Leonean peace
process because it cannot become completely stabilized before
normalcy returns to neighboring Sierra Leone, according to
Mulbah.
</P>
<P>
During the process, the minister said, "we are neutral, we are
waiting in a bid to bring peace to Sierra Leone and the entire
sub-region."
</P>
<P>
Despite its recent criticisms of ECOMOG's military actions
against the junta in the troubled country, Liberia fully
supported the return of Kabbah to power and the junta's quit in
April next year, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Liberian President Charles Taylor has announced that his
government would not allow anyone to use the land of Liberia as a
launching pad for attacks against Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG has its headquarters in the Liberian capital of
Monrovia.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Visits New York Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
visited the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) here this morning,
adding much color to the aging stock market which experienced much
volatility over the week.
</P>
<P>
The world's largest stock market went through great up-and-
downs at the beginning of this week. Its daily trading volume hit
1 billion shares Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As a special guest of the NYSE, the Chinese president was
invited to ring the opening bell and see for himself how the old
market operate with new technology.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin was greeted by NYSE Chairman Richard Grasso at the
doorway paved with red carpet. He was first ushered into a board
room at the 6th floor for a brief meeting with dozens of
entrepreneurs from the local financial circle.
</P>
<P>
"As a world's financial center, I believe it has a lot to offer
in the financial management for us to learn," Jiang said, adding, "I
am looking forward to further cooperation between the Chinese and
American financial organizations."
</P>
<P>
As he was introduced by Grasso at the balcony some 20 feet
above the main trading floor, the Chinese president was greeted by
a loud applause.
</P>
<P>
At a few seconds to 9:30 a.m., Jiang said loudly over the
microphone to the floor, "Good morning! I wish you good trading!"
Than he pressed the electronic button which ignited the sound of a
real bell and drew another big applause.
</P>
<P>
Jiang walked down to the pit and was shown around by Grasso
and other NYSE officials who introduced different facilities of
the market.
</P>
<P>
The 205-year-old market has now more than 3,000 listed
companies from across the world whose shares value more than 9
trillion U.S. dollars. Jiang was told that 17 Chinese companies
in different varieties have also listed at the market.
</P>
<P>
Grasso once told Chinese reporters that he hope to see more
successes of China's reform efforts which would prompt more
Chinese companies to join the world market. He added that would
also attract more participation of international investors in
China's economic development.

Shirwa had served in the cabinet of Hussein Aidid as Minister
of National Reconciliation and Peace Restoration since the end of
1994 until September 28, 1997 when he defected.
</P>
<P>
The NSC was set up by 26 Somali political movements at Sodere,
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Ethiopian News Agency today quoted Shirwa as
saying that he defected because he felt responsible for the
future of his nation as the leadership of Hussein Aidid has
become unable to fulfill Somali expectations.
</P>
<P>
"But on the contrary Aidid is for the destruction and the
continuation of the civil war in Somalia, rejecting the
initiatives of reconciliation process forwarded by regional
countries and member states of the United Nations," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Although Shirwa is the first in the cabinet to come out and
publicly announce his defection, there are many others who are
waiting for favorable conditions to do the same.
</P>
<P>
"I and my colleagues served Aidid's cabinet in the hope that
we would persuade Aidid and his few followers to restore peace...
Now we realized that Aidid is not working for the interests of
Somalia and the peace of brotherly co-existence with neighboring
countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the colonel, the junior Aidid is now involved in
offensive fighting in Bokol and Bay regions in southern Somalia
where his militiamen have destroyed villages, committed genocide,
looted and raped innocent people.
</P>
<P>
The National Salvation Council will meet here on November 12
to prepare for the national reconciliation meeting to be held
later in Bossaso, Somalia.

<HEADLINE> Confidence Returns to Lebanon: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri said today that the confidence in Lebanese economic and
trade role has come back although Israel is occupying 15 percent
of its territory.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a Japanese magzine on the eve of his
official visit of Tokyo, Hariri said that the grave problem
Lebanon is facing is Israeli occupation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli occupying troops carved out a 1,500 square kilometer
"security zone" to buffer attacks by Islamic militant Hezbollah
(Party of God) guerrillas. About 5 percent of Lebanese population
are living in the area.
</P>
<P>
Except the people in the south, the Lebanese have been leading
a normal life over the past five years and the government is
striving to maintain a stable economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese economy grew at an annual 4 percent and inflation has
declined in this period, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government is trying to reduce interest rate and
increase loans for trade in Lebanese currency, he added.
</P>
<P>
In order to encourage investments in the private sector and
agriculture, Hariri said, the government supports commercial
banks to grant loans to facilitate their development.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese currency has rallied against the U.S. dollar, with
the current exchange rate at 1,340 pounds to one dollar compared
with 3,000 pounds to one dollar in 1992, he added.

<P>
MOSCOW, November 1 (Xinhua) -- A Russian official said today
that Russia and Japan should handle their bilateral affairs,
especially sensitive issues, very cautiously.
</P>
<P>
To seek a hasty settlement on the sensitive issues could result
in new problems, said Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory
Karasin in an interview with Inter-fax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the bilateral dispute on fishing and territory,
Karasin said that both countries agreed that only through sound
and positive relations in various fields can a solution to these
complicated matters be found,
</P>
<P>
The informal summit between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto this weekend in the
Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk will guide the development of the two
countries' constructive relations, said Karasin.
</P>
<P>
The minister said both Russia and Japan cordially hoped to
cooperate in various fields.
</P>
<P>
The territorial dispute between the two countries has been a
big obstacle to a peace treaty formally ending World War II
hostilities.
</P>
<P>
Japan is demanding the return of four Pacific islands, known in
Russia as the Southern Kuriles and Japan as the Northern
Territories. They were seized by Soviet troops in the final days
of the war.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zhenghua, New Chairman of Non-Communist Party CPWDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 1 (Xinhua) -- For demographer-turned party
leader Jiang Zhenghua, getting involved in politics is a new
challenge that the 60-year-old plans to meet head on.
</P>
<P>
At the 12th National Congress of the Chinese Peasants and
Workers Democratic Party (CPWDP) which ended today, Jiang was
elected new chairman of the party's Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The party was founded in 1930 and is one of the leading
non-Communist parties in China. At present, there are 65,000 party
members, most of whom are senior intellectuals in the medical
circles.
</P>
<P>
In accepting the new post, Jiang said that he has been
accustomed to experimenting in the laboratory, but "it is of great
significance to lead the party and contribute to the country's
trans-century development and socialist democratic politics."
</P>
<P>
Jiang was born in October 1937, in Hangzhou, east China's
Zhejiang Province. After graduating from Xi'an Jiaotong University
in 1959, he was for many years a teacher and researcher at the
university.
</P>
<P>
He participated in the country's early studies on missiles,
atomic reactors, radar and industrial automation. Since the 1970s,
he has been involved in demography, with two years spent studying
on the subject in Bombay, India, in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Jiang has won worldwide fame in the field of
demography. Due to his remarkable contribution, he was elected a
council member of the International Union for the Scientific Study
of Population (IUSSP) in 1993, the first Chinese to be accepted
into the academic institution.
</P>
<P>
At that time, he served as vice-minister in charge of the State
Family Planning Commission. He conducted surveys in the rural
areas personally to carry out original research on the country's
population situation.
</P>
<P>
Partly because of his persistent efforts, the 23rd IUSSP
General Population Conference was held in Beijing from October 12
to 17 this year.
</P>
<P>
"As a non-Communist party which participates in the country's
political affairs, the CPWDP will continue to work closely with
the Communist Party," Jiang Zhenghua said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's wife is also a demographer. They have two daughters.

MOSCOW, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto approved a plan on
bilateral cooperation in politics, economy and finance during
their meeting today, said the Russian President's Press Secretary
Sergei Yastrzhembsky.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders, who started today an informal weekend summit,
also exchanged views on the general idea of developing
Russian-Japanese relations during a four-hour boat trip down the
Yeniser River.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky, who labelled today's meeting as very successful
but did not give details, said Yeltsin and Hashimoto discussed the
bilateral territorial dispute, which has been an obstacle to a
peace treaty that would formally end World War II hostilities.
</P>
<P>
Japan is demanding the return of four Pacific islands, known in
Russia as the Southern Kuriles; in Japan, they are known as the
Northern Territories. They were seized by Soviet troops in the
final days of the war.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Hashimoto met twice before, once at the Moscow
nuclear security summit in April of 1996 and the other at the
Denver Summit of Eight last summer, where they agreed to hold an
informal meeting.

<HEADLINE> EAT May Bring Hope to Cancer Treatment: Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Electrochemical acupuncture
therapy (EAT) may give a new hope to cancer patients, especially
those suffering from malignant superficial tumors, according to a
medical report released here today.
</P>
<P>
"Out of 1,610 malignant cancer cases, 1,185 were completely or
partially relieved after using EAT, with the effectiveness rate at
74 percent," Prof. Zhao Fengrui said in the report he co-wrote
with Prof. Xin Yuling, from the Beijing-based China-Japan
Friendship Hospital, who led a five-year clinical study of
EAT-based cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
The documented cases included cancer of the lung, liver,
esophagus, breast, skin, thyroid, parotid, malignant melanomas
and carcinomas of the mouth.
</P>
<P>
The EAT procedure involves piercing a tumor with metal needles,
which are connected to a computerized EAT machine with adjustable
voltage, current and electricity.
</P>
<P>
"Once needles are electrified, the tumor is actually in an
electric field, in which negative and positive electrodes work on
cancer cells and finally kill them," Zhao explained. Negative and
positive electrodes working together ultimately leads to
dehydration and carbonization of cancer cells, which destroys
them, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that EAT is particularly effective in curing
superficial tumors, such as skin cancer, thyroid cancer, breast
cancer, vascular tumors and fibroid tumors.
</P>
<P>
"Guided by ultrasonic or scanning techniques, needles can be
inserted into a tumor inside the human body so that lung cancer,
liver cancer and esophageal cancer can be treated," Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
The research group followed up on all 1,610 cases for five
years. "The survival rates of one, three and five years for the
malignant group were 87.6 percent, 58.8 percent and 41 percent
respectively," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report was released at the current Academic Conference of
the World Federation of Acupuncture-moxibustion Societies, which
listed EAT as one of new acupuncture-moxibustion therapies that
combine the traditional therapy with modern technology.
</P>
<P>
Although EAT has been proved to be safe and effective by the
research, Zhao said that treatment methods should be further
improved.
</P>
<P>
"It was adopted for treating cancer just years ago. But we do
hope it can be accepted by more doctors and people so that it can
save more cancer patients," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 1 (Xinhua) -- A Russian official said today
that Russia and Japan should handle their bilateral affairs,
especially sensitive issues, very cautiously.
</P>
<P>
To ignore the warning could result in new problems that would
require immediate and rapid settlement, said Russian Deputy
Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin in an interview with Inter-fax
news agency.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the bilateral dispute on fishing and territory,
Karasin said that both countries agreed that only through sound
and positive relations in various fields can a solution to these
complicated matters be found,
</P>
<P>
The informal summit between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto this weekend in the
Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk will guide the development of the two
countries' constructive relations, said Karasin.
</P>
<P>
The minister said both Russia and Japan cordially hoped to
cooperate in various fields.
</P>
<P>
The territorial dispute between the two countries has been a
big obstacle to a peace treaty formally ending World War II
hostilities.
</P>
<P>
Japan is demanding the return of four Pacific islands, known in
Russia as the Southern Kuriles and Japan as the Northern
Territories. They were seized by Soviet troops in the final days
of the war.

<HEADLINE> FIS Says Japan Ruins Its Future Olympic Bids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Japan will ruin its chances of
hosting future Olympics if it rejects a demand for a longer men's
downhill course at the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano, world's skiing
federation chief said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Marc Hodler, President of the International Ski Federation
(FIS), said they would accept a decision to be made on November 20
by the Nagano Organising Committee (NAOC) as well as Japanese
government, business and sports leaders over whether to lengthen
the course, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The FIS chief had previously vowed to fight to the last minute
for the starting point of the showpiece event to be raised from
the present 1,680 meters above sea level to 1,800 meters -- a move
that would encroach into an environmentally protected area.
</P>
<P>
The four-year-old FIS request, aimed at preventing the race
from becoming the shortest downhill in Olympic history, has been
rejected by NAOC on the ground of environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, the organising committee is working
against sports ... against athletes," said Hodler, who heads the
IOC coordination commission. "So far, even in the worst case of
the bad Olympic Games, sport was always perfect, fair and in
favour of the athletes."
</P>
<P>
Hodler said he had in mind a bid by Osaka, western Japan, to
host the 2008 Summer Games against possible competition from many
of the cities.

<HEADLINE> Giant Project Offers Central China Province New Opportunity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING, Hubei, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei
province had come across a rare opportunity for growth as it plays
host to the site of the Three Gorges Project, China's largest ever
water conservation project.
</P>
<P>
Provincial Governor Jiang Zhuping voiced the common wishes of
the 57 million people in his province when he said Hubei will go
all out to ensure that the project will be carried out
successfully.
</P>
<P>
Jiang acknowledged that market demand created by the huge
investment of the project will produce a tremendous positive
impact on Hubei's economic growth, and that the huge amount of
labor force, building materials, electronic and machinery
products, construction equipment, and farming and sideline produce
required by the project are precisely the competitive trades of
Hubei's economy.
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime, the Three Gorges Project is also helping the
province open wider to the outside world," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges area was a relatively underdeveloped area
owing to poor communications and fund shortage, Jiang said, adding
that the project will help the area get rid of poverty as the
local environment for investment and communications facilities
have improved greatly since the project started in 1993.
</P>
<P>
A 350-km expressway from Yichang, the nearest city to the
project site at Sandouping, to the city of Huangshi has been open
to traffic, and a 60,000-end program controlled exchange and the
Three Gorges Airport have gone into service.
</P>
<P>
Yichang is now a city which has been designated by the state
to open to outside investment, while the Three Gorges area has
been cited as an open and development area.
</P>
<P>
When the project is in full swing after the damming of the
Yangtze on November 8, Jiang noted, even more funds will be
injected into the project, and Hubei province will prompt more
local businesses to bid for the project and promote the
restructure of product mix in the Three Gorges area.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Hubei has worked out some 230 investment projects for
the area, which are expected to draw a total investment of 28
billion yuan, and plans to build Yichang into China's largest
hydropower center, a major base for chemical industry, and a
world-class tourism city with a population of one million to 1.2
million, according to Jiang.
</P>
<P>
The governor expected the city of Yichang to help advance
economic development in the entire southwestern part of Hubei
province.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Migrant Population Census in Full Swing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Yin Shuanglai arrived at a
temporary resident's home in the southern suburbs of Beijing early
this morning to distribute questionnaires for a migrant population
census which started at midnight Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I'd have gone on to work if he hadn't gotten here so early,"
said Zhao Dianyun, the family breadwinner, whom Yin had tried to
contact five times without success prior to the census.
</P>
<P>
Yin is among the 60,000 workers who will be canvassing every
block of the city's 18 districts and counties from November 1 to 8
to register the temporary residents and obtain information needed
by the city government to better manage the migrant population and
improve their quality of life.
</P>
<P>
Two registration activities, involving those who might fail to
respond to the general census, and those entering the city by
planes, trains or buses, were launched before November 1.
</P>
<P>
All the migrant population, including those from Hong Kong and
Macao, are targets of the census, which is the largest of its kind
in the country. PLA soldiers and armed policemen who come from
other parts of the country are not included.
</P>
<P>
Zhao's home is located in Dahongmen, Fengtai District, where
more than 50,000 people, mainly from east China's Zhejiang
Province and nearly twice the number of the local residents, are
packed together in an area of six sq km.
</P>
<P>
"They are mostly engaged in garment making and selling," said
Yin, who is in charge of the census work in the area. To fulfill
his quotas, he has to enter a dozen households a day, usually with
six or seven people cramped in a room doing tailoring, to collect
the necessary numbers.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the census is to get more accurate statistics of
the total number, regional distribution, education level and
professions of the city's temporary residents, said Gu Yanzhou,
deputy-director of the survey headquarters.
</P>
<P>
"It will also help the family planning workers to know how many
children the female population of childbearing age have or are
going to have," Gu added.
</P>
<P>
The census is expected to end by November 15 and the results
will be published in late December, he said.

MOSCOW, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov and his visiting French counterpart Lionel Jospin on
Friday criticized Baghdad on Friday for banning Americans from
taking partin the United Nations arms inspection teams in Iraq. They
described the move as unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers said in a joint statement that they
supported the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan's
proposal to send a special committee to Baghdad to make the
oil-rich Arab state cooperate with the U. N. inspection teams.
</P>
<P>
They said an oil embargo against Iraq will be lifted only after
the country fully cooperates with U.N. inspection teams.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad on Wednesday decided to expel the 10 Americans from the
100-strong U.N. weapons teams monitoring the implementation of
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq must also open for examination its programs of
weapons of mass destruction following its invasion of Kuwait and
the 1991 Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Seizure of South Korean Vessel Threatens Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government vowed
Saturday to take strong countermeasures, including suspension of
fisheries negotiations, in response to Japan's legal action
against a South Korean trawler.
</P>
<P>
Seoul intends to cancel informal fisheries talks scheduled to open
in Tokyo November 3-4 as well as a meeting on the two countries'
exclusive economic zones (EEZ), officials said here.
</P>
<P>
Japan recently captured a South Korean fishing boat that was
violating Japan's self-declared maritime territories and brought
an indictment against its captain at a summary court late Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
"Japan ignored our demand for immediate release of the vessel and
the crew and indicted the captain according to its own laws," said
the officials.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministry called officials in the Japanese Embassy for a
immediate release of the boat and the crew, and also an apology for
Japan breaking its promise not to capture South Korean fishing
boats until a new fishing regime is concluded to replace the 1965
fisheries convention.
</P>
<P>
Officials emphasized that South Korea can no longer forge ahead
with fisheries talks.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean boat, Gyerim-ho, was caught Wednesday near
Tsushima Island after it entered Japan's unilateral-drawn boundary,
devised without prior consultation or agreement with Seoul.
</P>
<P>
So far, South Korea has been clinging to the principle that the
two countries should abide by the 1965 accord until a new one is
worked out.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Daily Attacks Turkey for Incursion into </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 1 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian daily today
strongly attacked Turkey for its recent incursion into northern
Iraq, saying that the act would throw the lives of locals into
turmoil and disarray.
</P>
<P>
The English-language Iran Daily today Issued an editorial,
lashing out at Turkey for "taking western silence as an
opportunity to demand the right to create for itself a security
zone beyond its southern border."
</P>
<P>
It noted that a weak Iraqi government coupled with security
zones imposed in the north and south by Western countries and
their complacent silence toward Turkish incursions, ostensibly
in pursuit of the guerrillas of Turkish outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK), have given Ankara ample scope to turn northern Iraq
into an arena for expansive military maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
International organization and foreign powers such as France,
Russia and Iran have never ceased to stress the importance of the
Iraqi territorial integrity, the daily said, adding that they
have strongly condemned foreign intervention in this sensitive
region and termed it as a threat to Iraq's integrity.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been warned of serious consequences unless its
forces are withdrawn and the "security zone" shelved, the paper
added.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military forces have launched several cross-border
actions against the PKK rebels in northern Iraq, raising great
concern from its neighboring countries, such as Iran and Syria,
which repeatedly urged Turkey to stop such kind of actions.
</P>
<P>
However, Ankara always defends its actions as a defensive
measure to protect its southeastern province from the
penetration of the PKK rebels.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has said its troops established a security zone in
northern Iraq to facilitate the search of Kurdish rebels based
there.

TOKYO, November 1 (Xinhua) -- A dispute over the men's downhill
race at the Nagano Winter Olympics will be resolved until November
20, Games organisers and Olympic officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after a series of meetings involving
International Olympic Committee (IOC) Director-General Francois
Carrard, International Ski Federation (FIS) President Marc Hodler
and Makoto Kobayashi, director-general of the Nagano Organising
Committee (NAOC), a news report from Nagano said.
</P>
<P>
"A final decision will likely be made on November 20," NAOC
vice president and Nagano prefectural Governor Goro Yoshimura was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
NAOC's executive board meets in Tokyo on that date.
</P>
<P>
Nagano Olympic Organising officials had said they wanted the
issue to be resolved at this weekend's meeting of the IOC
Coordination Council, which is looking at preparations for the
February 7-22 Games. But they said that was not possible because
of strong resistance from Hodler.
</P>
<P>
FIS and NAOC have been arguing about the start of the downhill
race for years.
</P>
<P>
FIS says the current course starting at 1,680 meters is too
short to be a true Olympic test, while NAOC says raising the start
to the proposed 1,800 meters would break Japanese environmental
laws by putting it into a national park, even though recreational
skiers already use the park.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Take Action Repairing its Shipping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has pledged to cast
off unseaworthy ships flying its flag in an attempt to repair
its already tarnished reputation on shipping, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot Minister of Communications and Works Leontios
Ierodiaconou was quoted as saying Friday at a meeting of Finance
Committee of the House of Representatives that the government was
no longer prepared to see its name "dragged through the mud by
unscrupulous operators."
</P>
<P>
He said that repeated detention of sub-standard
Cypriot-flagged ships in other countries, the lack of
inspectors, question marks over training of seafarers and
accidents -- highlighted by the recent cruise liner Romantica
blaze off Cyprus coast and the oil spill from the ship Evoikos
off Singapore -- have harmed the Cyprus flag's reputation.
</P>
<P>
Immediate action was being taken to weed out all of those
blackening the reputation of Cyprus shipping, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts to upgrade the flag and increase its prestige are
now being speeded up and we have introduced a number of
independent inspectors toward this aim," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the Cypriot authorities have
appointed 13 such inspectors. They will eventually employ 50
inspectors at various designated ports in, among others,
Australia, Canada, and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' open register has propelled the island to the
forefront of the global maritime industry, expanding its fleet
to the extent that it now ranks fourth in the world in 1996,
with a registry of 2,733 ships, just behind Panama, Liberia and
Greece.
</P>
<P>
The island's revenues from its merchant shipping estimate at
50 million Cyprus pounds (around 100 million U.S. dollars) a
year.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Cuts Food Imports to Boost Local </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese government has
halted imports of over 150 agricultural and food items as of
Friday in a bid to remove foreign competition and boost local
production, local newspaper Beirut Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Minister of Agriculture Shawki Fakhoury revealed a
list of agricultural products whose import has been banned or
restricted at a news conference Friday.
</P>
<P>
The banned imported products are olives, vegetables, pine
nuts, vinegar, potatoes and their extracts, olive oil, canned
beans, frozen fruits, fresh liquid milk, yoghurt, eggs and
chicken, he said.
</P>
<P>
Water melon, kiwi, avocado, pineapples, dates, frozen and
canned vegetables, honey, some kinds of cheese, cut flowers,
powdered milk will be subject to custom's duties raging from
15 percent to 100 percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first step in improving and protecting
agricultural production," Fakhoury said, "We expect to reduce by
10 percent our 1998 import bill."
</P>
<P>
Lebanon, which spends about 1.5 billion U.S. dollars a year on
food imports, aims to cut its food import bill by half within the
next three years, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Fakhoury said that import controls may lead to an increase in
prices and smuggling. A meeting with the Internal Security Forces

<HEADLINE> International Conference on Acupuncture-Moxibustion Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 1 (Xinhua) -- An academic conference of the
Beijing-based World Federation of Acupuncture-Moxibustion
Societies (WFAS) opened today at the Beijing International
Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,300 experts from some 30 countries and regions
converged to display the progress they have made in
acupuncture-moxibustion treatment, and discuss ways to increase
the use of the ancient therapy worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Attending the opening ceremony were Wu Jieping, vice chairman
of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, State
Councillor Peng Peiyun and Health Minister Chen Minzhang.
</P>
<P>
Director-General of World Health Organization Hiroshi Nakajima
also extended his congratulations to the opening of the conference.
</P>
<P>
Acupuncture-moxibustion therapy, used to treat disease and
relieve pain, is done by piercing parts of the body with needles
or burning "moxa," a soft material yielded from herbs, on the skin.
</P>
<P>
According to traditional Chinese medicine, the human body has a
network of passages known as "jingluo," through which "qi," or
vital energy, and blood can travel.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, acupuncture-moxibustion effectively treats
disease by stimulating circulation of "qi" and blood along the
"jingluo."
</P>
<P>
China is believed to be the home of acupuncture-moxibustion;
historical records and unearthed relics prove that Chinese people
mastered the therapy more than 3,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
By using some high technology such as lasers, the ancient
medicine is re-emerging as an important alternative medicine.
</P>
<P>
Acupuncture-moxibustion has been used in treating more than 300
kinds of diseases, especially acute cerebral disease and pain.
</P>
<P>
Acupuncture-moxibustion has been introduced to some 140
countries and regions. WFAS has had 74 member societies that are
composed of more than 50,000 experts and doctors in some 40
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference, co-sponsored by WFAS and WHO, will
focus on acupuncture anesthesia, analgesia, acupuncture
mechanisms, meridian research, clinical research and other
subjects.
</P>
<P>
"WFAS will pursue a worldwide promotion of
acupuncture-moxibustion in order to support public health work of
all countries," Prof. Chen Shaowu, newly-elected chairman of WFAS,
told the audience at today's opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"The traditional therapy will play a key role in protecting
man's health in the next century," he said.

<HEADLINE> Seven Killed in Communal Clash in East Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 1 (Xinhua) -- A senior official has confirmed that
seven people were killed and seven houses razed in communal violence
in east Nigeria's Taraba State last week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 31 persons had been arrested, State Administrator Amen
Oyakhire said Friday.
</P>
<P>
He warned that persons suspected to have directly or indirectly
instigated and participated in the clash among the Jukun, Chamba and
Kutep communities in the state would be treated as detractors of the
country's current transition to civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
Those found culpable would be prosecuted, said the administrator,
who is also the state police commissioner.
</P>
<P>
The latest violence, said to be the third in the last seven years
in the state, followed the removal of elected local council officials,
local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to Oyakhire, the councils were dissolved following a
nationwide readjustment of constituency in which some were transferred
from one area to another for administrative convenience.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has about 250 ethnical groups. It has been a headache of
successive governments to play balance among them.
</P>
<P>
Taraba is not the first state where local communities clash in
order to protect their own interest during the process of transition
program.
</P>
<P>
Osun State in southwest Nigeria witnessed repeated clashes earlier
this year between peoples of Ile-Ife and Modakeke ethnical groups.
</P>
<P>
The bloodshed, triggered off by the relocation of the local council
headquarters from Modakeke to Ike-Ogbo in Ile-Ife area, claimed the
lives of dozens of people and injured hundreds of others, with tens of
houses burnt down.
</P>
<P>
violence was also reported in the oil producing city of Warri in
south Nigeria's Delta State last March when the peoples of Ijaw
Itsekiri communities clashed over the relocation of the local
government site.

<P>
MANILA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos said today
that the Philippines "warmly welcomes" the understanding that had
been reached between Beijing and Washington during the current
visit of Chinese President Jiang Zemin to the United States.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Ramos said this historic visit opened a new and
positive chapter for the China-U.S. relationship, "a relationship
which is at the center of our concerns here in the Asia-Pacific
region."
</P>
<P>
During their summit Wednesday, Jiang and his U.S. counterpart
Bill Clinton agreed to establish "a constructive and strategic
partnership between China and the United States oriented toward
the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
"The Philippines, as a friend to both nations, welcomes these
as important contributions for sustained regional progress and
prosperity in the Asia-Pacific, which can be secured only through
dialogue and cooperation among all countries within the region, "
Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the Philippine government expects this new phase in
China-US relations to help bring Beijing and Washington closer on
security, political and economic issues, thus ensuring a more
stable political and economic scenario for the Asia-Pacific region
in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
As chairman of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN), Ramos said he is confident that all ASEAN member states
share the same views and will continue working together with China
and the United States to enhance regional stability and advance
regional development.

<HEADLINE> China's Tertiary Sector Hot Spot for Foreign Investment: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Foreign participation in the
Chinese tertiary sector will continue to expand, and opportunities
in the growing sector should be enormous, according to a recent
research report published by the Hong Kong Trade Development
Council.
</P>
<P>
During 1995 and 1996, more than 20 percent of all foreign
investment projects were in the tertiary sector, taking a share of
over 26 percent in terms of investment amounts.
</P>
<P>
The report focuses on the latest liberalization measures and
scope of foreign participation in individual sectors in China,
such as banking, infrastructure, transportation,
telecommunications, retail distribution, foreign trade, property,
legal and accounting services.
</P>
<P>
The aggregate asset value of the 142 foreign banks in China's
inland areas amounted close to 30 billion U.S. dollars. Most of
the newly established foreign banks are able to make a profit or
at least break even in two years.
</P>
<P>
According to World Bank estimates, infrastructure investments
in China will amount to 744 billion U.S. dollars in the run-up to
the year 2004. The enormous capital requirement will become a hot
spot for foreign banks, the report says.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Upgrade Navy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria, the regional power in
west Africa, is to upgrade its navy arsenal to the standards in
developed nations in a bid to meet the challenges and commitments
in Africa and other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
Past and current experience in peacekeeping operations have
made such an exercise imperative although the cost of it is yet
to be evaluated, according to Nigeria's number two figure, Chief
of General Staff Oladipo Diya.
</P>
<P>
Diya made the remarks at the end of a four-day chief of naval
staff annual conference in the capital Abjua Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot afford to ignore the development of our naval
forces especially with our experience in peacekeeping in the
sub-region," Diya said, quoted by press reports today.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian navy is currently engaged in peacekeeping
operations in Liberia and Sierra Leone and a military operation
in the Bakassi area, where territorial
dispute has led to repeated clashes between Nigeria and
neighboring Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
"We must match our international preeminence with an effective
means of projecting sea power, otherwise, we run the risk of
becoming the proverbial giant with the feet of clay," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, Africa's leading oil producer with rich human and
other natural resources, has been keen of its "big brother" role
in west Africa.
</P>
<P>
It regarded the navy as an important plank in its defence
capability, which Diya said needs to be properly equipped so as
to play its expected role in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Aside the external peacekeeping operation, Diya said, it had
become necessary to re-arm the Nigerian navy to make it capable
of countering external aggression.
</P>
<P>
"We must never let it be doubted that any illegal and
unwarranted incursion into our territorial waters would be
swiftly countered," he warned, in an apparent reference to the
dispute with Cameroun over the ownership of the Bakassi
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Navy Chief Rear Admiral ike Akhigbe had called for
radical transformation of the naval forces to meet the challenges
of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He said the navy needed "appropriate capacities which include
mobile air and sea combat systems, anti-ship and anti-air
systems".

<HEADLINE> Pak Senate Passes Bill on Apex Court Judge Number </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Senate passed a
bill today concerning the number of judges of the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The bill--the Supreme Court Number of Judges Bill 1997 -- was
approved with consensus in the Senate session.
</P>
<P>
Law Minister Khalid Anwar termed it a "happy augury as the
entire House is united." He thanked the opposition for extending
support to the treasury benches.
</P>
<P>
The passing of the bill meant an ending to the two-month-long

Under the bill, the number of judges in the apex court has been
fixed at 17. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said in his speech to the
nation at the National Assembly Friday night that the government
had agreed to elevate the five judges recommended by Chief Justice
Sajjad Ali Shah.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the objectives of the Bill, the law minister said
that its purpose was to fix the total membership of the Supreme
Court.
</P>

Anwar later told the media that the passage of the bill has
solved all the disputes which had been overshadowing Pakistan's
politics for the last few months.
</P>

that the notification will be issued today.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Economy Shows Mixed Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's economy is running
ahead with mixed patterns, as the latest report of the Bank of
Thailand showed both positive and negative signs for sectoral
performance.
</P>
<P>
According to the monthly report released by the Thai central
bank on Friday, Thailand's manufacturing output dropped by 5.1
percent in August compared with the same month of last year.
</P>
<P>
Private investment rode in August the declining trend to a
record low due to shrinking investment in the country's
construction sector.
</P>
<P>
Inflation has been rising since the Thai government set the
baht to float beginning on July 2, hitting 7 percent in September
mainly due to the currency depreciation, the value-added tax hike
and higher oil prices on the world market.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the figures given by the Thai central bank also
indicated positive signs in the country's economic performance.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's exports registered a year-on-year growth of 25.1
percent in August, mainly due to increased outbound shipment of
high-tech products and domestic resource-based products, like
vehicles, cement, chemicals, computers, integrated circuits,
telecommunications equipment, plastic products, petroleum products
and sugar.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit in August posted 22.9 billion baht (531
million U.S. dollars), widening slightly compared with July.
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit in August narrowed to 18.6 billion
baht (453 million dollars), pushing down the total deficit for the
first eight months of this year to 174.1 billion baht (4.24
billion dollars), a drop of 36 percent from the same period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand foreign exchange reserves returned to 30.7 billion
dollars on October 15, an increase of 2.3 billion from the figure
as of September 15.
</P>
<P>
Despite the mixed performance, analysts said the country's
economy is still slowing down. The vulnerable baht, which has
dropped to a record low of more than 41 percent against the U.S.
dollar due to the impacts from international monetary markets and
the domestic political situation, will cast a heavier shadow over
the future of the economy.

<HEADLINE> Inaugural G-15 Trade Exhibition Opens in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The first G-15 Trade
Exhibition opened here today in conjunction with the grouping's
7th summit scheduled for November 3-5.
</P>
<P>
A total of 144 firms from G-15 countries are attending the
five-day show where a wide range of products including chemicals,
steel and iron, automotive component parts, industrial equipment,
textile and plastic products are on display.
</P>
<P>
A total of 93 Malaysian firms and agencies are represented at
the Malaysian Products Exhibition '97 aimed at promoting Malaysian
goods.
</P>
<P>
Officiating at the exhibition, Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said the success of the G-15 countries depends on
their ability to adapt to the changing global market.
</P>
<P>
The world was galloping towards globalization and
liberalization, the mean of which is interpreted by the developed
countries as removal of barriers to their trade and their
investments including portfolio investment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries need to watch this very carefully as their
own industries are not yet able to compete and take advantage of
investments in other countries, Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
He said that opening the developing countries' markets might
result in unrestricted entry of competing products from
industralized countries which could afford to lose because they
could make profits elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir stressed the need to organize trade missions and
business delegations among the G-15 members so that they had a
better understanding of the needs and demands of one another
within the grouping.
</P>
<P>
He said G-15 as a group has a large population and this itself
offered a ready market for a wide range of products and services.
</P>
<P>
"It is therefore imperative that the G-15 member countries take
the initiative to forge new trade and economic partnership,"
Mahathir said.
"There are vast opportunities to be tapped in all the member
countries, and we should not let any slip away."
</P>
<P>
He hoped the G-15 exhibition would help promote products and
services initially in the G-15 markets.
</P>
<P>
"Producing world-class goods that are competitive in the world
market should be our goal," he said, adding G-15 members should
make their presence felt through aggressive marketing and
promotion to enable them to get a bigger share of world trade.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> G-15 Foreign ministers Meet in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministers of the
G-15 member countries met here today to prepare for their leaders
summit which begins on November 3.
</P>
<P>
The ministers deliberated on the draft communique to be
submitted to the summit for approval, the thrust of which,
according to official sources, covers all important issues of
concern to developing countries including the impact of
globalization on developing countries and how they could work
together to meet the growing challenge.
</P>
<P>
There have been suggestions that economic agreements among
members, such as the one on investments and double taxation, be
made legally binding, Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad
Badawi told reporters after chairing the one-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
There was also a need to expand the current G15 membership,
especially to include some West Asian countries as that region was
currently not represented, he said, adding that several West
Asian countries were showing interest in joining the G-15 but the
names would not be announced as it had not been finalized.
</P>
<P>
The G-15 currently comprises Malaysia, Indonesia, India,
Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Egypt, Jamaica, Mexico,
Nigeria, Peru, Senegal, Venezuela and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Kenya will be admitted as the 16th member during the
forthcoming three-day summit.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said the guideline for a country's membership in the
grouping is "the ability to contribute both substantially and
financially to the grouping, complete interest and commitment in
the G-15 ideals and the need for a balanced regional
representation".
</P>
<P>
He said that as no consensus had been achieved on the frequency
of the G-15 foreign ministers meeting, it would continue to be
held annually. However the frequency of the G-15 Summit will be
left to the decision of the leaders, he added.
</P>
<P>
The G-15, in an effort to enhance North-South dialogue, may
consider meetings with the Group of Seven developed countries
(G-7) if current issues warrant such a contact, Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 comprises the United States, Germany, France, Britain,
Japan, Canada and Italy.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad proposed earlier this
year a dialogue between the G-15 and G-7 to enhance economic
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Uganda Takes Steps to Eradicate Mass </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Cai Guozhong)
</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 1 (Xinhua) --The Ugandan gvovernment will
take various measures to eradicate mass poverty in the country as
shows in the Poverty Eradication Action Plan issued recently by
the Ministry of Planning and Economic Development.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the poverty eradication plan, practical
measures will be taken by the Ugandan government to wipe out mass
poverty by reducing absolute and relative poverty from 66.3
percentage and 86.2 percentage at present to below 10 percentage
and 30 percentage respectively by the year 2017.
</P>
<P>
In order to raise income of the people living in the rural
areas, the government launched in March 1995 a credit scheme
called "Entandikwa" in local language, through which loans are
appropriated for farmers opening business.
</P>
<P>
In the 1994-95 financial year, 6.42 billion Shillings (some
6.42 million U.S.Dolars ) were allocated to the credit scheme
with the help of the Africa Development Bank. It has since then
recovered over 1.1 billion Shillings (1.1 Million dollars) from
beneficiaries in the 22 districts.
</P>
<P>
In order to attract investment, the Uganda Investment
Authority was set up in July 1991. Up to now the authority has
approved 2,275 projects with a planned investment of 3,799
Million dollars. The projects had created about 157,700 jobs for
urban dwellers.
</P>
<P>
The government has also done a great deal in upgrading rural
infrastrure. During the past 11 years, 57,400 km long highway
network has been rehabilitated in the country, accounting for 65
percent of the total 88,320 km of road in the country.
</P>
<P>
In June 1996, the central government promised to supply a set
of feeder road maintenance equipment to each of 39 districts to
help improve infrastructure. In April this year, each of 26
districts got a set of feeder road maintenance equipment.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve the quality of life, top priorities had
been given to social services such as health, education, water
supply, environment and disaster management.
</P>
<P>
The government set aside 28.63 Million dollars early this year
for the Universal Primary Education (UPE) for 1997. The program,
which began its implementation early this year, means that four
children in each family could enjoy free primary school
education. In other words, it will provide opportunities for 3.25
million children of Uganda's total 3.98 million children of
school age.
</P>
<P>
Before the implementation of UPE, only 2.1 percent of the 3.98
million Ugandan children aged between 6-12 could enjoy the
primary education.
</P>
<P>
To improve water supply for the Ugandans, and the people in
the rural areas in particular, a gravity flow scheme has been
carried out since 1987, enabling about 300,000 people to benefit
from the program.
</P>
<P>
the scheme refers to water supply system whereby water is
tapped from spring, river or lake and transported through pipes
to communal taps in lower areas. The project could provided many
poor people the access to safe drinking by spending little money.
</P>
<P>
Fortyfive small water supply projects have come into on
operation in the country and another 34 are under construction.
When all the water supply projects will come into full operation
by the year 2000, another 800,000 people could benefit form it.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's major indicators of poverty are as following: life
expectance has gone down from 50 years in the late 1960s and
early 1970s to less than 43 years at present, while rate of those
regarded as obsolute poor in the country has increased to 66.3
percent of its total population from less than 50 percdent.
</P>
<P>
The obsolute poor in Uganda, which has bee regarded as the
14th poorest in the world, are people who are living below the
poverty line, that is 100 U.S.Dollars per-capita expenditure per
annum.
</P>
<P>
However, owing to the implementation of the economic reform
program for the past 10 years, Uganda's economy has improved
dramastically within the last 6-7 years due to prevailing peace
and stability across the country. Living costs remained stable
over the last three-years and availability of goods and services
has been greatly improved.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that another economic reform package is to be
worked out by the Ugandan government to further the
mass-poverty-elimination campaign.

<HEADLINE> Special Hospital for Cancer Opened in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Highly-skilled Chinese doctor
Zheng Wenyou, known in China and overseas for curing cancer with
traditional Chinese medicine, said today that he had opened a
special hospital in Hong Kong to treat cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua in his newly-established
hospital named after his name and located near Mong Kok metro
station in Kowloon, the miracle-working doctor, 73, said that he
had started his cancer-treating career 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Armed with only the traditional Chinese medicine theory and 21
series of traditional Chinese medicines invented by himself in
decades of test and practice, he has cured tens of thousands of
cancer patients in China and overseas.
</P>
<P>
As to the results of his treatment given to advanced cancer
patients, a report from a state health department showed the
cure-efficiency rate reached 91 percent.
</P>
<P>
His efforts and achievements have been not only cheered by
ordinary Chinese people but also praised by a number of
high-ranking officials and senior experts in China, who described
him as a national hero.
</P>
<P>
"I want to bring some happiness to the Hong Kong people. I want
further to show the entire world a fact that cancer can only be
subdued in China, by the traditional Chinese medicine," the doctor
said.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, Zheng established his first tumor hospital in Shenzhen
city in South China. Entitled Shenzhen Zheng Wenyou Tumor Hospital
of Traditional Chinese Medicine, it is the biggest private
hospital in China.
</P>
<P>
Since then, he has set up a total of 124 tumor hospital
branches throughout China, an anti-cancer center in Thailand and
representative offices in the United States and Taiwan
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Zheng also invented a simple but effective method for
curing drug users in the recent years, which has been welcomed as
the best of its kind in today's world. With the help of the method,
entitled "Zheng's Anti-drug Method," drug users can finally give
up their evil habit after taking Zheng's medicines within six to
ten days.
</P>
<P>
To popularize his anti-drug method, he established an anti-drug
center in Chuxiong, China's Yunnan Province, in spring this year
with the help from local authorities.
</P>
<P>
Cancer, drug and AIDS are three major threats to human health
in the world. After years of study and test, Zheng put forward his
idea before the world: all AIDS patients have no immunity against
the AIDS virus, and improvement of immunity -- key for curing AIDS
patients.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua that he had found out some ways for dealing with
AIDS through animal tests, without giving further details.
</P>
<P>
Before saying good-bye, Zheng said: "I am not fond of eating,
drinking and being merry. I have not any other habits. I do not
love money. I hope only that I can bring some benefits to the
people, and fully eliminate the three headaches -- cancer, drug
and AIDS -- in my life."

<HEADLINE> Foreign Airlines Urged to Join Thailand's Tourism Years </HEADLINE>

<P>
BANGKOK, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is ready to invite
foreign airlines to join its "Amazing Thailand" tourism years in
1998 and 1999, a senior Thai official said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Transport and Communications Ministry has decided to
make arrangements to allow chartered flights to visit Thailand
more conveniently, said Sawat Sitthiwong, director-general of the
Aviation Department of the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Ordinary chartered flights will get approval in two or three
days, while those with schedules lasting two or three months will
get approval in one week, Sawat said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The department also will allow 76 airlines, which operate
regular flights to Bangkok, to launch special flights when needed,
the official was quoted as saying by local newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thailand will negotiate with other countries for
more aviation rights, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Tourism Authority of Thailand earlier this year launched
the tourism promotion years and set a target of attracting some 17
million tourists.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Determined to Hold Maneuvers near N. Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has voiced its
determination to hold two military exercises in and near Cyprus
and the eastern Mediterranean next week.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Daily News today quoted military officials as
saying that during the two maneuvers, code-named Toros 2/97 and
Kararlilik' 97, Turkish warships will anchor in the harbors of
Magosa and Girne in northern Cyprus while Turkish F-16 and F-4
fighters will land at Gecitkale Airport in the Turkish-controlled
part of the Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military jets will practice all anti-missile
maneuvers, including one against the controversial 150-kilometer
range S-300 anti-craft missiles that are expected to be
transferred to Cyprus by Russia.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Turkish Major General Koksal Karabay as
saying that the two maneuvers in and near northern Cyprus would
be held under the joint-defense operation concept between Turkey
and Turkish Cypriots against any attempt which aims
to harm Turkish or Turkish Cypriots' interests.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkey plans to take a group of journalists to the
island on November 4-5 to observe its exercises.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish war games were apparently a response to the
three-day joint Greek and Greek Cypriots' military exercises in
the Greek Cypriot-controlled area on October 10-13.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been concerned about Russia's plan to sell the
S-300s missiles to Cyprus. The Turkish military has repeatedly
threatened that it will destroy these missiles if they are
finally deployed in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece have long been at odds due to some
outstanding issues, including mineral resources under the Aegean,
airspace division as well as the Cyprus problem.

KUALA LUMPUR, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Asian finance ministers
who are to meet in Malaysia early next month will be briefed by
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the progress of an IMF
study on Malaysia's recent proposals for rulings on currency
trading.
</P>
<P>
IMF's Managing Director Michel Camdesus will attend the two-day
meeting beginning on December 1 and brief participants about the
progress of the study, Malaysian deputy prime minister Anwar
Ibrahim said today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be attended by all the nine ASEAN members and
also by China, China's HKSAR, Japan, South Korea and Australia.
</P>
<P>
"At the upcoming meeting, IMF will inform us the development in
fixing procedures or prudential regulations governing movement of
hedge funds," Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, said after
launching the 75th International Co-operative Day in Kelana Jaya
near here.
</P>
<P>
He said the IMF managing director telephoned him last night
confirming his participation at the meeting to brief it on the
progress of the IMF study on the Malaysian proposal.
</P>
<P>
He said Camdesus also informed him of IMF's rescue package of
23 billion U.S. dollars to Indonesia to rebuild investor
confidence in the economic fundamentals of that country.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said Malaysia was confident the IMF aid to Indonesia and
its loan of 17.2 billion U.S. dollars to Thailand earlier this
year would expedite recovery of the weakened economies of the
region, including Malaysia's.

what our Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad is talking about, and now
people accept this," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir has adamantly maintained that rules were needed to
regulate and make currency trading transparent because of the
destructive effects of speculation and manipulation on regional
currencies since last May. The Thai baht was first to succumb
followed by the Indonesian rupiah, the Philippine peso, the
Malaysian ringgit and the Singapore dollar.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Project: Key to Developing the Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING, HUBEI, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing Three
Gorges Project represents a major part of China's endeavor to
develop the hydraulic resources of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Located at Sandouping in Yichang of Hubei Province and 38
kilometers from the Gezhouba Barrage water conservation project,
it is a mammoth undertaking for China.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to prevent floods, generate electricity, and
improve navigation on the river.
</P>
<P>
The key to the project consists of three parts: providing flood
prevention and discharge, building power generators and improving
navigation.
</P>
<P>
The first part of the project is a concrete gravity dam 185
meters high with a peak water level of 175 meters.
</P>
<P>
The second part consists of two power plants at the foot of the
dam. Twenty-six 700,000-kilowatt generating units will be erected
in the plants.
</P>
<P>
The third part includes a five-stage ship lock, a vertical ship
lift and a temporary lock for navigation during construction --
all along the left bank.
</P>
<P>
After construction of the dam is completed, a huge reservoir
will be formed when the locks are closed. When the water level
reaches 175 meters, the length of the reservoir will be 662.9
kilometers; water surface area, 1,045 square kilometers; and
average width, 1576.4 meters.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project is expected to greatly improve flood
control along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River,
able to deal with 100-year floods.
</P>
<P>
The annual capacity of the Three Gorges power station will be
18.2 million kilowatts, making it the biggest in the world.
</P>
<P>
After construction of the project is completed, 10,000-ton
ships will be able to sail downstream from Chongqing to Hankou.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Parliamentary Election Candidates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Eleven Jordanian parliamentary
election candidates were referred to the prosecutor general for
election fraud last week, semi-official newspaper Jordan Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The legal action against these candidates was initiated
following people's complaints that their voting cards had been
collected from the poll stations with forged power of attorney
documents, the paper quoted Mazen Armouti, a spokesman for the
parliamentary election, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian Parliament is made up of the upper house and the
lower house. All the 40 Upper House members are appointed by King
Hussein and the upcoming elections to be held Tuesday are for the
lower house.
</P>
<P>
So far, 548 people have registered as eligible candidates to
compete for the 80 seats in the Lower House, as against 559 in
the last elections in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Four other candidates who were detained for interrogation at
police stations ere released after they returned the voting cards
they had illegally obtained, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
Investigations of pre-election irregularities would continue
and "very probably" would lead to further arrests and legal
action, Armouti said.
</P>
<P>
Scandals erupted continuously long before the elections
unfold. Forged voting cards were found in some districts and some
civilians registered their names for two times. The government
was accused of registering 9,000 people from the military,
security and intelligence services for the elections in violation
of the kingdom's constitution.
</P>
<P>
The fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood, a major force in
Jordan's political arena holding 22 seats in the outgoing lower
house, and nine other left-leaning opposition parties have
announced to boycott the elections in protest of the government's
tightened grip on press and publication.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is ruled by monarch Hussein and the
Constitution. Political parties emerged in 1952 and were soon
banned. The ban was lifted in 1991 to allow the existence of a
multi-party system.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Project: World's Largest Water Conservation Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING, Hubei, November 1 (Xinhua) -- China's Three Gorges
Project is the largest water conservation project in the world.
</P>
<P>
Taking the total amount of concrete work as one example, the
Three Gorges Project totals 26.43 million cubic meters, 2.5 times
the figure for the Gezhouba Barrage project and twice that of the
Itaipu project in Brazil, which is currently the largest water
conservation projects in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project requires the most concrete poured
during one year -- 4.109 million cubic meters, double Gezhouba's
2.03 million and 1.35 times Itaipu's 3.04 million.
</P>
<P>
The main construction targets of the Three Gorges Project are:
</P>
<P>
-- Removing 102.59 million cubic meters of stone and earth and
filling with 29.33 million cubic meters of stone and earthwork;
</P>
<P>
-- Mixing and pouring 27.15 million cubic meters of cement;
</P>
<P>
-- Erecting 281,000 tons of metal structures;
</P>
<P>
-- Making and erecting 354,000 tons of reinforcing bars;
</P>
<P>
-- Building 231,000 square meters of leak-proof concrete walls;
</P>
<P>
-- Installing power generators with a combined capacity of 18.2
million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
China now boasts a contingent of approximately 250,000 workers
employed in constructing the water conservation and hydropower
projects. Their experience in building concrete gravity dams,
hydropower plants, and large ship locks have prepared them to
build the Three Gorges Project.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Government to Close 16 Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government have
decided to close 16 commercial banks which are to be unhealthy,
senior officials announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced by Minister of Finance Mar'ie
Muhammad at a news conference held at the State Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Minister/State Secretary Moerdiono, Minister of Trade and
Industry Tungky Ariwibbowo and Bank Indonesia (central bank)
Governor Sudradjad Djiwandono were also present at the press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Moerdiono said the closure of the banks is the first step the
government has taken following a reform package announced on
Friday in a bid to stabilize the country's economy. According to
the package, the government will further trim its budget spending,
abolish monopolies in several food commodities and liquidate
insolvent banks.
</P>
<P>
The reform measures are part of a new, three-year program
agreed on by an International Monetary Fund (IMF) team and the
Indonesian government after two weeks of tough negotiations which
often lasted until midnight.
</P>
<P>
Late last night, the IMF announced a 23 billion U.S. dollars
multilateral financial package involving the World Bank and the
Asian Development Bank to help Indonesia stabilize its financial
system.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia Governor Sudradjad said the decision was based
on the results of an investigation conducted by Bank Indonesia.
The banks to be closed are insolvent to the point of endangering
business continuity, disturbing the overall banking system, and
harming the interests of society, he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, dozens of small and middle-sized
banks, out of a total of 240 banks in the country, fall into the
category of "unhealthy banks."
</P>
<P>
However, Sudradjad said, Bank Indonesia has striven to rescue
banks which are facing difficulties. The efforts included changing
the bank's board of commissioners or directors, requesting
shareholders to increase their capital, improving the quality of
earning assets and encouraging business consolidation or
acquisition by sound banks.
</P>
<P>
As a result of these efforts, he said, a number of banks had
been successfully rescued and were now operating in a sound and
orderly way.
</P>
<P>
But several banks are still facing serious structural
difficulties and the effort to rescue them had failed to produce
the desired results, he said.
</P>
<P>
With a view to strengthening the national banking system, the
government has decided to withdraw the licenses of the 16
commercial banks, he said.
</P>
<P>
The timing and the form for liquidating the banks will be
announced in "maybe one or two days," he said.
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asian Nations, including Indonesia, have been badly
hit by the current monetary crisis which started in early July.
The Indonesian rupiah has drooped by about 50 percent against the
U.S. dollar since the beginning of this year.

<HEADLINE> Yangtze River: China's Largest River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING, HUBEI, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The Yangtze River is
the longest in China with a valley of more than 1.8 million square
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The length of its trunk stream is 6,300 kilometers and it
annually empties 960 billion cubic meters of water into the
sea. Its length and water volume make the Yangtze third among the
world's major rivers after the Amazon and the Nile.
</P>
<P>
The Tuotuo River, the initial tributary of the Yangtze,
originates at Geladaindong Mountain in the Tanggula Range in
Qinghai Province in western China. The section from Nadangqu to
Yushu is called the Tongtian River; and from Yushu to Yibing in
Sichuan Province, the Jinsha River.
</P>
<P>
Starting from Yibing to its mouth on the East China Sea, it is
known as the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze flows through Tibet, Sichuan, Chongqing, Hubei,
Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu, and goes into the East China
Sea at Shanghai. Its main tributaries include the Yalong,
Minjiang, Tuojiang, Jialing, Wujiang, Xiangjiang, Hanjiang,
Qingyi and Huangpu rivers.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze intersects with the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal in
Zhenjiang of east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The upper reaches west of Yichang in Hubei Province have many
shoals and rapids; the middle reaches between Yichang and Hukou of
Jiangxi Province have a number of tributaries and large lakes; and
the lower reaches east of Hukou are much wider.
</P>
<P>
During flood seasons, 10,000-ton ships can sail to Wuhan in
Hubei Province, and smaller ships can go as far as Yichang.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River basin is China's most populous and prosperous
area. Major cities along it include Chongqing, Wuhan, Nanjing, and
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The total of exploitable hydraulic energy along the Yangtze is
estimated at 200 million kilowatts. More than 2,800 kilometers of
its trunk stream are navigable.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges (Qutang, Wuxia and Xiling gorges) are located
on the section of river between Fengjie of Sichuan Province and
Yichang, and the ongoing Three Gorges Project -- the world's
largest water conservation project, is at Sandouping at the middle
of Xiling Gorge.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: S.E. Asian Banks in for Tougher Times </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- After being hit hard by a
devastating financial crisis, Southeast Asian banks are bracing
themselves for tougher times ahead with soaring bad loans,
declining profits and loss of confidence by investors.
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, Southeast Asian banks played a positive
role in the region's economic expansion, the fastest in the world.
But at the same time, lax rules in the banking sector resulted in
billions of dollars of non-performing loans, which have undermined
the region's financial position.
</P>
<P>
If speculative attacks on Southeast Asian currencies could be
blamed for the outbreak of the crisis in July, analysts said,
troubles in the region's banking sector should, at least, partly
be responsible for both the spreading and the persistence of the
market turmoil.
</P>
<P>
As the financial crisis entered its fifth month now, fears
about the health of Southeast Asian banks are weakening further
investors' confidence in the region's economic future.
</P>
<P>
The fears are well-founded.
</P>
<P>
With the depreciation of Southeast Asian currencies between 10
percent and 40 percent in the last four months and rising interest
rates, more companies in the region, some foreign debt-ridden ones
in particular, could hardly continue their business operations and
requested re-scheduling or cancellation of their debts. The
defaults have imposed heavier financial burdens on banks.
</P>
<P>
According to Jardine Fleming International Securities Ltd, as a
result of the crisis, non-performing loans will peak at a combined
73 billion U.S. dollars in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, the
Philippines and Singapore through 1998. That is equal to 15
percent of outstanding loans in the five nations and just over 13
percent of their combined gross domestic product (GDP) at current
exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
The worst-hit countries will be Malaysia, Thailand and
Indonesia, Jardine Fleming said. Non-performing debts will rise
through 1998 and peak in Malaysia at 19 billion dollars, or 23
percent of its GDP. In Thailand, non-performing loans will peak at
27 billion dollars, or 20 percent of its GDP, and in Indonesia,
bad loans are expected to rise to 19 billion dollars, or 11
percent of its GDP.
</P>
<P>
However, loan-loss provisions set aside in Thailand, the
Philippines and other countries are currently insufficient to
cover the sector's bad loans. Deutshe Morgan Grenfell recently
warned in a study that the rising level of non-performing loans
and declining earning growth could cripple Philippine banks.
</P>
<P>
The study said that from 1994 to 1996, lending of Philippine
banks shot up 38 percent, while provisioning for loan losses
dropped from 3.3 percent to just 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The lack of loan loss provision will inevitably lead to bank
closures in the region with non-performing loans still sharply
increasing, economists said.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, the government had to close 58 of 91 finance
companies. Moody's Investor Service Inc. says that as many as five
of the country's 15 commercial banks could fail by the end of
1998. Some banks in the region are likely to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
Since the outbreak of the crisis, central banks have taken
measures to limit bank lending to property companies and increase
loan-loss provisions. But these measures have also drastically
reduced banks' profits and made bank operations more difficult.
</P>
<P>
The Bankers Association of the Philippines said that banks in
the country stand to lose as much as 500 million to one billion
pesos (14.2 million to 24.4 million dollars) a year each after the
central bank approved additional two percent of loan loss
provisions.
</P>
<P>
Analysts in Thailand said they expect bank earnings this year
to be poor as a result of an increase in loan-loss provisions at
commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The increases, stemming from the banks' own decisions as well
as from central bank requirements, are eating into the earnings of
all Thai financial institutions, they said.
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, Thailand's biggest banks experienced
massive profit declines as they were pumping as much as money as
they can into loan loss reserves. Bangkok Bank PCL, the country's
largest bank, put around four billion baht (106 million dollars)
into its loan-loss reserve and its third quarter net profit fell
43 percent compared with a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The declines were even steeper at Krung Thai Bank PCL, the
country's second largest commercial bank, with Its third quarter
net profit falling 88 percent.
</P>
<P>
But these measures have still failed to rebuild investors'
confidence in the banking sector. The most obvious sign is that
bank stocks in the region have plunged in recent months.
</P>
<P>
In Malaysia, bank stocks have plunged 50 percent in recent
months, even though the country's banking sector is widely seen as
the strongest in Southeast Asia after Singapore. In the
Philippines, prices of bank stocks also have also dropped to their
lowest in years.
</P>
<P>
But the effect of the financial crisis is still unfolding. The
banking sector could become more fragile when it begins to feel
the full impact of the crisis next year, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Roy Ramos, economist of U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs,
warned recently that the banking crisis in the region could last
as long as seven years if the proper corrective measures are not
taken.

<HEADLINE> Efforts to Protect Rare Plants in Three Gorges Paid off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING, Hubei, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists
have made progress in protecting rare and endangered plants in the
area of the gigantic Three Gorges Project, according to sources
from the Wuhan Botanical Research Institute under the Chinese
Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
According to a researcher, many rare and valuable plants grow
in profusion in the Three Gorges area, including 47 species that
have been listed under state protection.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Chinese scientists have started collecting and
sorting out rare and endangered plant species since the early
1980s, he said the Wuhan Botanical Research Institute have
undertaken to study the impact of Three Gorges Project on the
local rare plants and set forth counter-measures to preserve them
and return them to the nature.
</P>
<P>
"To transplant these plants in other areas with similar
ecological conditions is one of the most effective measures for
their protection," he said. "And we have made breakthrough in
transplanting large quantities of rare species in other places,
facilitating further development of abundant plant resources in
the dam area."
</P>
<P>
In early last March, a team of experts from the Beijing
Botanical Garden were sent here to collect rare species soon-to be
submerged under the inundation-line of the future embankments, and
they have transplanted more than 3,000 varieties to other places,
including the Haiyun Botanical Garden in Yichang, a city some 40
km east of the Three Gorges Project construction site, and the
Jiugongshan Botanical Garden in Tongshan County and the Wuhan
Botanical Garden of Hubei Province.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan to Invest in Pharmaceutical Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan is planning to
invest 700 million U.S. dollars in the coming 10 years, aiming to
thoroughly change the depression of pharmaceutical industry and
gradually free itself from mainly relying on importation in its
medicine supply.
</P>
<P>
At present, imported medicines in the Kazakh market account for
97 percent of the total, with the gross import value amounting to
135 million dollars, said the latest "Business Week" published
Friday and available today.
</P>
<P>
Senior medical official Aman Duisekeyev said that Kazakhstan
had formulated a 10-year outline to develop its pharmaceutical
industry.
</P>
<P>
The first step, the official said, is to reform the existing
pharmaceutical enterprises in a bid to increase their productivity.
</P>
<P>
After that Kazakhstan is set to attract more foreign investment
in the pharmaceutical industry and create new enterprises up to
advanced international standards.
</P>
<P>
The grim situation of Kazakh medicines and public health has
brought the total debts of medical units nationwide to as much as
96 million dollars, an official in the public health department
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the incidence of intestinal diseases and
tuberculosis keeps increasing, which makes developing the
pharmaceutical industry and lowering medical costs all the more
urgent for Kazakhstan, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Jiang: China Offers More Opportunities for U.S. Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin tonight urged the U.S. government to take more
positive steps to assist U.S. firms in their investment in China
and push forward bilateral trade links.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a dinner party here hosted in his honor by the
U.S.-China Business Council and the New York-based China Chamber
of Commerce in the U.S., Jiang said that though China is now a
major trading partner of the United States, its most favored
nation trading status still comes under annual review in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
This, he said, has rendered bilateral economic relations and
trade in an unstable situation over the years and also made
American entrepreneurs doing business or making investment in
China always "feel the sword of Damocles over their heads."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that as the world's 11th largest trading country,
China is still barred from the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
"This is unfair," he said.
</P>
<P>
Without China's participation, the WTO is incomplete. "China's
membership in the WTO will benefit all sides," he added.
</P>
<P>
For years, Jiang said, the discriminative export control policy
by the United States has limited its own export to China and
deprived its firms of many opportunities to gain access to the
Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
It is only natural for countries doing business to have
frictions with one another, he said. They should be resolved
through consultations.
</P>
<P>
"Such practices as imposing sanctions or threatening the use of
sanctions not only run counter to the trend of the times but will
end up doing nobody any good," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his hope that the U.S. business community will
make new contributions to closer China-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
"Strengthened economic cooperation and increased trade will
help improve political relations between the two countries while a
sound and stable political relationship will, in turn, facilitate
the growth of economic relations and trade," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president encouraged the American business people
to seize the opportunities brought by an opening China, and urged
the U.S. government to take positive and effective steps to assist
their firms in entering the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States are highly complementary
economically and stand to benefit from the great potentials of
economic, trade, scientific and technological cooperation, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has become China's second largest trading partner and
China the fourth largest trading partner of the U.S., he noted.
</P>
<P>
China is already the biggest buyer of U.S. aircraft with the
purchase of a total of 337 planes up to now. This month, the two
sides have signed a contract to buy 30 more and an agreement of
intent to buy another 20, according to the Chinese president.
</P>
<P>
"Despite our bumper harvests for several years running, we
remain the biggest buyer of U.S. wheat and have recently announced
a purchase of 700,000 tons of U.S. wheat," he went on to say.
</P>
<P>
Regarding overseas investment in China, Jiang said, the United
States has become the second largest investor in China, with more
than 23,000 U.S.-funded projects in China in last June while their
contractual value reached 36.8 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, a total of 80 million kilowatts of
installed capacity of electricity will be added, 16,000 kilometers
of railway and 2,800 kilometers of highway built and 70 to 80
million telephone lines installed, Jiang said, adding that the
U.S. has an investment edge in all these areas.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed U.S. businessmen to invest in China's central and
western regions, as the development there, he said, "may very well
match that of the American West in scale."
</P>
<P>
Before Jiang's speech, George Fisher, Chairman of the United
States Business Council, and Shen Beizhang, Chairman of the China
Chamber of Commerce in U.S., both expressed the view that the
U.S. visit by the Chinese president is a very important step
forward towards establishing a closer Sino-U.S. relationship for
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
They both hoped that American businessmen will fully support a
steadily growing and improving China-U.S. relationship.
</P>
<P>
The guests tonight were mainly entrepreneurs from nearly 100
major U.S. companies like Boeing, IBM and AT&AMP;T and leaders of
Chinese companies operating in the United States. Also attending
the dinner were Chinese and American diplomats.

<HEADLINE> Pak 13th Amendment to Constitution Challenged: Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The 13th Amendment to the
Constitution, under which the president was stripped of powers to
dissolve the National Assembly, has been challenged in the Supreme
Court of Pakistan, local newspapers said today.
</P>
<P>
While challenging the 13th Amendment, Syed Iqbal Haider,
chairman of Pakistan Muslim Welfare Movement, pleaded on Friday
that the amendment was harmful to the constitution as it invites
martial law and thus is liable to be suspended, according to the
reports.
</P>
<P>
The petitioner contended that Article 58(2b), under which the
president was vested with the authority of dissolving the National
Assembly, was a guarantee for a peaceful change in the country
avoiding anarchy, loss of precious lives and economic disruption
which could be caused by civil disobedience, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, the Parliament unanimously passed the 13th
Amendment under which the 8th Amendment including Article 58(2b)
of the Constitution was annulled.
</P>
<P>
The 8th Amendment giving power to the president to oust the
government was introduced in 1985 and was used four times from
then to 1996 for the dissolution of the national and provincial
assemblies.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Contribute Up to One Billion US Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Australian Treasurer Peter
Costello today said Australia would contribute up to one billion
US dollars to the International Monetary Fund's (IMF's) rescue
package for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"Australia's contribution, if required, could be up to one
billion US dollars," Costello said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"It would be in the form of 'supplemental financing' and would
remain at all times conditional upon adherence to the IMF
program," the treasurer said.
</P>
<P>
"Australia's contribution would only be drawn down after
recourse to IMF financing and would take the form of a loan which
would be repaid once the support program came to an end."
</P>
<P>
Earlier today the IMF reportedly announced a 18 billion US
dollar package to help revive the Indonesian economy, which has
been hard hit by the Asian currency crisis and the world share
market turmoil.

Costello said the success of the rescue package was important
for the financial stability in the region.
</P>

"A return to financial stability and steady economic growth in
the South-East Asian region is in Australia's interests because of
the contribution that exports make to our own growth and
employment opportunities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard promised last week during
his visit to Indonesia that Australia would help out Indonesia's
ailing economy.
</P>

the issue of discrimination and unjustified protectionist measures
followed by the developed nations, the local press said today.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin, Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of the
crude palm oil (CPO) physicals, tin and rubber closed the week
higher.
</P>
<P>
During the week, prices on the CPO physicals market closed
higher with November South higher by 39 ringgit (about 11.47 U.S.
dollars) to 1699 ringgit (about 499.7 U.S. dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
On the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM), which gained some strong
buying interest this week, tin price rose 45 sen to close the week
at 18.41 ringgit (about 5.41 U.S. dollars) per kg compared to
17.96 ringgit per kg at last week's close.
</P>
<P>
Accumulated turnover this week amounted to 412 tons against 449
tons last week, with local, European and Japanese buyers
dominating the market.
</P>
<P>
Next week, local tin market is likely to remain firm on
follow-through buying support and continued weakening of the
ringgit, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
On the Malaysian rubber market this week, rubber prices were
steady, remaining unchanged or up one or two sen, due to technical
adjustments following continued weakening of the ringgit.
</P>
<P>
November RSS One this week ended 3.50 sen higher at 293.00 sen
(about 86.17 U.S. cents) per kg and SMR 20 was up 4.5 sen to
291.50 sen (about 85.73 U.S. cents) per kg.
</P>
<P>
The International Natural Rubber Organization (INRO) daily
market indicator price for October 30 was at 209.78
Malaysia/Singapore cents per kg against 211.74 cents on October
23.
</P>
<P>
The five-day moving average stood at 210.54 cents against
208.63 cents last week.
</P>
<P>
The local rubber market is expected to show some uptrend next
week when high buying interest would probably be seen as buyers
covered positions due to the shortage, but sellers may be
tightening supply to hike up prices, a dealer said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
contemplating establishing a savings bank with skilled and
efficient manpower for enhancing savings and investment in the
country, the national news agency BSS reported here today.
</P>
<P>
This statement was made by Bangladeshi Finance Minister Shah
AMS Kibria while addressing a function in Dhaka Friday on the
occasion of the World Thrift Day.
</P>
<P>
The planned bank will be free from the vices like corruption
and loan default culture, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the new concept of banking will be
developed with the consultation and cooperation of the private
sector, which will be a model of successful banking.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government has taken up different steps to
eradicate poverty from the country, and the government needs
extensive cooperation from all concerned quarters to meet the
challenges of the coming century, the minister was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister regretted that Bangladesh has poor number of
savings' depositors, which is very low even in comparison to its
neighboring countries, and he urged the people of the country to
make themselves savings depositors through changing attitudes of
extravagant spending.
</P>
<P>
"Only enough savings can ensure a developed nation side by side
with the development of its citizens, and we have to create
congenial atmosphere for maximum savings and investment in the
country," the minister added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 31 (Xinhua) -- British Minister of State at
the Foreign Office, Tony Lloyd, said today that Britain and the
European Union (EU) hoped that Yugoslavia will return to the
European family soon and he urged Yugoslavia to comply with five
conditions to rejoin it.
</P>
<P>
"Neither we nor the European Union want the FRY (Yugoslavia) to
remain a pariah state within the international community," local
press quoted Lloyd as saying after he met Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
"We want to see the (country's) economy flourish and the Serb
people rediscover prosperity. We want the FRY to rejoin the
European family," he told reporters in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
"Achieving this ... is in the hands of your leaders. They must
work with the international community, not against it," Lloyd
said.
</P>
<P>
Lloyd also laid out four other conditions that Belgrade must
meet -- freedom of the media, a dialogue with ethnic Albanians in
the southern province of Kosovo, recognition of the latest
election results in the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, and full
compliance with the Dayton peace accord terms.
</P>
<P>
The international community lifted a crippling 3 1/2-year-old
trade and political embargo against Belgrade in 1996 after
President Milosevic signed the Dayton peace treaty in 1995 which
ended the war in nearby Bosnia.

commitments to China's market.
</P>
<P>
The companies are IBM, AT&AMP;T and Bell Labs of Lucent

</P>
<P>
In the company of Louis V. Gerstner Jr., chairman of the Board
and Chief Executive Officer of the IBM, Jiang watched the
technical demonstration of Regional Weather Forecast depicting
weather conditions within 10 square kilometers, Web Collaboration
KIOSK, namely business application and interactive services to the
public, and Personal Area Network, a system of electronic data
transfer by touch mainly used in banking activities.
</P>
<P>
The IBM has shown increasing interest in China's huge market,
with its registered investment in China increasing at an annual
rate of 40 percent. It has eight projects in China, which cover
production and services.
</P>
<P>
It has also established a research center in China, one of the
company's seven such centers in the world and the first in a
developing country.
</P>
<P>
In AT&AMP;T, Jiang addressed the U.S. middle and primary school
students and pupils through the company's national network,
encouraging them to study hard and train themselves into talented
people for the future.
</P>
<P>
AT&AMP;T's business in China includes providing Easylink for
delivering documents and Global Frame Relay mainly used to provide
data information between China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
In Lucent Technologies, Jiang was shown some of Bell Labs'
research accomplishments, including technologies on speech
processing, virtual reality and electron beam lithography and the
SCALPEL system, a new generation of electron beam lithography tool
for manufacturing faster, smaller and more powerful microchips.
</P>
<P>
The system is said to be able to print microchip features that
are 250 atoms wide, or 0.08 microns.

Jiang also held talks with top researchers of the company. The
firm has committed itself to helping update the technologies of
China's relevant industries.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Chief Justice of Pakistan
Sajjad Ali Shah has expressed his pleasure over Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif's decision to accept his recommendations to appoint
five judges to the Supreme Court, informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
"He is happy and expressed satisfaction that his stance, based
on law, has been accepted," the sources quoted an apex court
official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The decision of the government came two days after the Supreme
Court invoked Article 190 of the Constitution asking President
Farooq Leghari to announce the appointment of the five judges as
the government failed to do the same as per recommendations of the
Chief Justice.
</P>
<P>
In a speech telecast nationwide from the National Assembly
Friday evening, Sharif announced that "we agreed with the Supreme
Court on the elevation of the five judges in accordance with the
recommendations of Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah."
</P>
<P>
Sharif had earlier vowed to fix judges' strength through the
parliament while Sajjad indicated in public statements that any
move by the parliament could be struck down if made without
consulting him.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the National Assembly passed a resolution
claiming supremacy of the parliament in the legislative process.

<HEADLINE> Thai Foreign Reserves Continue to Rise in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's foreign exchange
reserves continued to rise in October, posting 30.7 billion US
dollars as of October 15.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics released by the Bank of
Thailand on Friday, the figure was 2.3 billion dollars more than
that recorded as of September 15.
</P>
<P>
However, the Thai central bank said, the increase in October
included 600 million dollars from the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) aid package and 400 million dollars from Thailand's
dollar-buying forward obligation.
</P>
<P>
As of September 15, Thailand posted its foreign reserves at
28.4 billion dollars and saw the first increase this year.
Thailand's foreign reserves have been declining since the
beginning of this year, reaching the bottom of 25.9 billion
dollars at the end of August.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said that Thailand still faces a serious
situation in its foreign reserves, as the Thai central bank
disclosed its net dollar-selling obligation at 23.9 billion
dollars, higher than 23.4 billion dollars it announced as of
August 19.
</P>
<P>
Central bank officials noted that Thailand had considered its
forward currency obligations when it decided to turn to the IMF
for the 17.2 billion dollar loan package.
</P>
<P>
The central bank will be able to keep the country's foreign
reserves at the level of 23 billion dollars this year as the IMF
required, they stressed.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Needs More Man Power to Protect Wild Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The Wild Life Department of Sri
Lanka is struggling in vain to stop illegal tree felling,
poaching, mining and marijuana cultivation due to a lack of staff,
its deputy director was quoted as saying by a local newspaper
today.
</P>
<P>
"The Wild Life Department which protects and manages over 13
percent of the country's land area has only less than 800
employees. This shortage of staff has impaired our performance,"
Deputy Director Nandara Atapattu said.
</P>
<P>
There are 57 wild life sanctuaries, 13 national forest reserves
and three natural reserves managed by the department.
</P>
<P>
Atapattu was quoted by the Daily News as saying that his
department should have at least 1,500 people to fight against
those illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
He said animal sanctuaries and forest reserves had become
"sanctuaries for illegal tree felling, poaching, mining and
marijuana cultivation."
</P>
<P>
He appealed for public cooperation with his department to
conserve the natural resources for the generations to come.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he disclosed that the country's forest cover has
dropped to 19.8 percent from 24 percent in 1989. During the 1950s,
forest cover of this Indian Ocean island nation was 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the decrease of forest to the increase
of population, saying it is inevitable because it has to make way
for the provision of essentials such as food, employment and
houses.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Liquidate Ailing Banks, Review Strategic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian central bank has
announced a government plan to liquidate banks considered to be
beyond rescue.
</P>
<P>
"Unhealthy banks will follow a process of acquisition or
merger. But banks that cannot be rescued will be liquidated,"
central bank Governor Sudradjad Djiwandono said here Friday,
without saying when action would be taken.
</P>
<P>
The central bank would help banks that were basically healthy
but suffering from liquidity problems, officials sources today
quoted the governor saying.
</P>
<P>
The plan to liquidate banks was part of reform package
announced by the government Friday following a series of
negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for
financial assistance to cope with the country's current monetary
crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to a three-year reform package agreed to by an
IMF-led team, the Indonesian government will further trim its
budget spending, abolish monopolies in several food commodities
and liquidate insolvent banks.
</P>
<P>
Late last night, IMF announced a 23 billion US dollar
multilateral financial package involving the World Bank and Asian
Development Bank to help Indonesia stabilize its financial system.
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asian nations, including Indonesia, have been badly
hit by the current monetary crisis which started from July this
year.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian rupiah has dropped by about 50 percent against
the US dollar since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Under the reform package, the government would also review
investment and expenditure in state-owned enterprises and
strategic industries, which comprise, among others, aircraft maker
IPTN and shipbuilding company Pt. PAL.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Hashimoto, Yeltsin to Hold Informal Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto left here this morning for Russia's East Siberian city
of Krasnoyarsk for informal talks with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin to solidify their personal rapport.
</P>
<P>
This will be their first informal meeting, which will feature a
frank exchange of views on a wide range of issues, including
personal matters, bilateral relations and current events.
</P>
<P>
However, there is no formal agenda for the talks, said Japanese
government officials. Hashimoto and Yeltsin will spend about nine
hours together, in the company of few, enjoying boating, dining
and a sauna.
</P>
<P>
Only two aides, Russian presidential spokesman Sergei
Yasterzhembsky and Japan's Deputy Foreign Minister Minoru Tamba,
will attend part of the session, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The talks are expected to encompass bilateral economic issues,
security and other cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region, matters
of global concerns, the thorny territorial row over a group of
Russian-held islands off northern Japan and future summit-level
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of the meeting, which the Japanese government
calls the Siberian trust-building summit, is to solidify personal
rapport and build mutual trust between the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
The disputed islands -- Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and the
Habomai isle group were seized by Soviet troops in the closing
days of World War II and have become the main stumbling block for
the two countries to conclude a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
Japan used to hold a policy of linking the territorial problem
with the improvement of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Realizing that it is unrealistic to bring about a quick
resolution to the territorial row, Tokyo has now become flexible
in its stance on the issue.
</P>
<P>
In July, Hashimoto outlined three principles -- trust, mutual
benefit and long-term vision -- to improve relations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
While showing eagerness to resolve the decades-long dispute
within this century, Hashimoto acknowledged that the issue "is not
something that can be settled in just two or three days."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Hashimoto still wants to "blaze a new trail" in
his talks with Yeltsin for at least confirming a direction for
resolving the territorial row.
</P>
<P>
Compared with Japan's wish to resolve the territorial row,
Russia is more interested in economic cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Russian Federation Council Speaker Yegor Stroyev expressed
strong hope in Tokyo Thursday for more help from Japan in Russia's
economy, saying "Deepening economic relations will lead up to
signing of a peace treaty."
</P>
<P>
During the Krasnoyarsk talks, Hashimoto is likely to show
Japan's readiness to promote economic cooperation, especially in
the development of energy resources, oil and natural gas, in the
Russian Far East and Siberia.
</P>
<P>
Among other possible economic topics are Japanese private
investment in Russia, training of Russian executives and Russia's
integration into international economic bodies.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto also plans to return the favors and invite Yeltsin to
Japan for more informal talks, possibly next spring, to further
strengthen bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
If everything goes well, the two informal sessions will lead to
a formal visit to Moscow by Hashimoto sometime next year,
government sources said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government to Crack Down on Sugar Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government is to take
tougher measures against the smuggling of sugar overseas, where
prices have become more attractive with the depreciation of the
baht.
</P>
<P>
Overseas prices are three to five baht a kilogram higher than
at home. Some 2,000 tons a day are going illegally to a foreign
country.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Ministry is worried that the rampant smuggling
will bring about a shortage in the domestic market, the Bangkok
Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Commerce Minister Vichai Chaichitvanitkul has urged
Finance Minister Kosit Panpiamrat to make sure customs houses
thoroughly check all cargo trucks carrying sugar out of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The trucks must be licensed and carry the authorized volumes.
</P>
<P>
However, local millers recently assured the Internal Trade
Department that no shortage was imminent because three million
tons of sugar were sufficient to meet demand until the new milling
season starting early next year.

<HEADLINE> Latin American Economy to grow 4.5-5 Percent in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Latin America's economy in
1997 will grow by 4.5 to 5 percent, one of the highest growth
rate in the past seven years, a senior official of the Economic
Commission for Latin America and Caribbean (Cepal) said today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Secretary of the Cepal Gert
Rosenthal said that 1997 will be a year of lower inflation,
expanded exports and general economic stability.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that problems still linger on, including
high unemployment and poverty rates.
</P>
<P>
Noting that regional integration is one of the greatest
achievements the Latin American countries made during the last
decade, Rosenthal said the process has boosted intra-American
trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
"This is an advance compatible with the economic
globalization. What the Latin American countries do now is to try
to increase their productivity by sharing markets, and see the
intra-American trade as something that facilitates their insertion
in the world market," said Rosenthal. Cepal is a 41-member
regional economic organization established in 1948.
</P>
<P>
He added that what must be avoided in Latin America, as in the
rest of the world, is to break up the region into sub-groups.
</P>
<P>
When talking about recent turbulences in the international stock
markets, Rosenthal said that Latin America was less affected than
what was supposed at the beginning.
</P>
<P>
"But anyway, as was demonstrated this week, no country is safe
from the direct or indirect repercussions of this phenomenon, and
we must be watchful and see what course it takes."

TEGUCIGALPA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The first customs post on
the western Honduran border with El Salvador was inaugurated today
to help control cross-border commercial traffic and manage imports

</P>
<P>
Opening the post in Pasamonos, Honduran President Carlos
Roberto Reina also inaugurated the rehabilitation of the access
roads, and a National Police office and the telephone system in the
central building of the customs office.
</P>
<P>
Reina also inaugurated the installation of electric energy in
the communities of Palo Blanco, El Zancudo, and Nahuaterique,
inhabited mostly by Salvadorans.
</P>
<P>
"All these works, especially the customs, will prevent problems
in our relations with our brother country, El Salvador, and that
is the reason we named it (the post) `La Concordia', symbol of the
spirit that must prevail among our peoples," the Honduran
president said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 31 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin said here today that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) should conduct its eastward expansion in ways unlikely to
trigger worries in Russia.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered at Moscow University, Jospin said his
country has been paying close attention to the military alliance's
eastward enlargement and that the nature of the relationship
between Russia and NATO members should be changed step by step.
</P>

The setting up this summer of the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint
Council will enable both parties to hold frequent dialogues on
European security, he added.

<P>
The prime minister stressed that France and Russia share
surprisingly similar stances on and purposes in all of key
international issues.

BUENOS AIRES, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Striker Gabriel Batistuta,
a surprise absentee from the Argentine national football team, was
finally given a recall on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The leading striker in the Italian club Florentina, who last
played in a 0-0 draw away to Uruguay in January, was included in
the squad for the World Cup qualifier at home to Colombia on
November 16.

The game has no realistic effect on the two teams as both of
them have already qualified for next year's finals.

Argentine coach Daniel Passarella, believed to have personal
differences with the 29-year-old striker, had already said that

<HEADLINE> France Proposes Soccer Players' Medical Booklet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 31 (Xinhua) -- French soccer authorities Friday
called for a scheme whereby all players would carry a booklet
detailing their medical records.
</P>
<P>
French football federation (FFF) chief Claude Simonet
said: "Football has been on everyone's tongues of late."
</P>
<P>
"But we must emphasise that professional football is not the
only sport using banned substances. Doping is a serious problem in
the whole of society," Simonet said after an FFF board meeting.
</P>
<P>
Four cases of doping -- all with the anabolic steroid
nandrolone -- have emerged in recent weeks involving first
division players Cyrille Pouget of Le Havre, Vincent Guerin of
Paris St Germain, Auxerre's Antoine Sibierski and Dominique
Arribage of Toulouse.
</P>
<P>
All four players have pleaded their innocence and shocked club
authorities, who consider the four exemplary professionals, have
pledged their support.
</P>
<P>
Positive tests by Olympic judo champion Djamel Bouras and a
leading handball player, also for nandrolone, have also shocked
the French government with calls in parliament for a separate
testing body not linked to any one sport.
</P>
<P>
The FFF meeting proposed that more funds should be made
available by the Federation and the National Football League (LNF)
for intensifying the number of random doping tests carried out on
professional and amateur players.

<HEADLINE> NZ Government Records Bigger Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Government
has chalked up 980 million dollars (608 billion US dollars) in its
operating surplus for the first three months of the current fiscal
year starting July.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Treasury available today show in the
three months, the surplus is not only bigger than the 743
million-dollar surplus recorded in the same period of the last
fiscal year, but is also 600 million dollars more than the
forecast for the first quarter of the current year.
</P>
<P>
Higher tax revenue contributed to the rise in surplus, despite
increased government spending, mainly on social welfare, health
and education.
</P>
<P>
A NZ Press Association report today quoted government officials
as saying the accounts would even out during the next nine months
and they expected the full-year surplus to be close to the
forecast 1.5 billion dollars (930 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The surplus is also seen as a backing to the government
assertion that the economy is on a sound footing.

<HEADLINE> US Ambassador Urges Congress to Pay UN Arrears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to the
United Nations Bill Richardson today urged the U.S. Congress to
pass legislation paying the nation's more than 1 billion U.S.
dollar arrears to the U.N. before adjourning for the year next
week.
</P>
<P>
"Good things are being done at the United Nations that save
U.S. taxpayers money," he said, "because nations apply their
resources jointly to resolve problems" such as eliminating polio,
smallpox and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
He told the legislators that if the U.S. debt goes unpaid, the
U.S. effectiveness at the world body in dealing with issues from
poverty and disease to nuclear proliferation, international
terrorism, drugs and the environment will be reduced.
</P>
<P>
"We are racing against the calendar," he said. "We have a
compromise where we pay this debt over three years in exchange for
a lot of reforms. It's not perfect but it's the only package we
have."
</P>
<P>
With the world facing dozens of issues where cooperation
between nations is essential, he said, "We have to hang together
as an international community and the United Nations is the best
vehicle for this."
</P>
<P>
He said that for many in the West and Congress, the United
Nations is sometimes unfairly associated with failure, but the
world body's universal, apolitical and neutral presence allows it
to work in areas where other aid groups would not be welcome or
even venture in the first place.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress has refused to pay the arrears, estimated at
around 1.4 billion dollars, demanding U.N. reforms and insisting
on reduced U.S. share of the U.N. budget.

<HEADLINE> Impact of Stock Market Turbulence on World Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The stock market turbulence
around the world suggests that the impact on the global economy
could be greater than previously expected, economists said.
</P>
<P>
First, there is the impact of slower growth from the Asian
areas on industrial countries' growth rates and secondly, the
wealth effects from falling stock markets in the west could also
dampen spending, said Mark Cliffe in HSBC Markets Ltd today.
</P>
<P>
The outlook for South East Asian economies is now gloomier than
many of economists had previously anticipated as a result of the
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, economists have revised their estimates for
economic growth across the Asian region from the previous forecast
of 7.1 per cent for 1998 down to 6.3 per cent.
</P>
<P>
The initial impact of this downward revision to Asian GDP
growth on the Organization for Economic Corporation and
Development is likely to be only fairly small, they observed.
</P>
<P>
However, economists continued, OECD net exports would suffer
because of the loss of competitiveness from the Asian currencies'
deprecations.
</P>
<P>
In view of these changes, economists downgraded their OECD GDP
growth forecast for 1998 from 2.8 per cent to 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the economists said that the Asian currencies crisis should
have beneficial effects on OECD inflation. They estimate that the
fall in the prices of Asian exports will help trim around 0.2 per
cent off OECD inflation next year.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Backs Indonesia's Reform Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- James D. Wolfensohn,
president of the World Bank, today expressed welcome for the
Indonesian government's economic reform program and support for
the IMF-led assistant package for the country.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank plans to contribute 2 billion U.S. dollars in
adjustment loans to support financial sector restructuring and
long-term structural policy reforms.
</P>
<P>
The initiatives are part of a package being assembled by the
Indonesian government with the support of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank
and some bilateral donors.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's financial support is to be accompanied by
technical assistance to help the Indonesian government implement
complex banking sector reforms. Overall, to support Indonesia's
economic growth and development, the World Bank plans to provide a
total of 4.5 billion dollars over the next three years for
adjustment operations and existing and planned investment loans.
</P>
<P>
Up to this fiscal year ended on June 30, 1997, the World Bank
has lent about 23 billion dollars for 78 projects in Indonesia. In
1997 fiscal year, the World Bank lending to the country totaled
914.6 million dollars for 11 projects.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Uneven Road to Lasting Peace in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The on-going close-door talks
between Khartoum and its rival rebel forces, the first since
1994, are expected to bring the first light of peace to the
largest African country devastated by 14 years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
The talks, started from Wednesday under the mediation of the
Intra-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) which embraces
Sudan, Kenya, Eritrea, Uganda, Ethiopia, Somalia and Djibouti,
are between the Islamic government team headed by Sudanese
Foreign Minister Ali Ssman Mohammad Taha, and the rebel
delegation led by Salva Kiir, chief of staff of the rebel Sudan
People's Liberation Army (SPLA).
</P>
<P>
Self-determination for the Christian and animist south and the
establishment of a secular Sudan are said to be high on the
agenda of the talks.
</P>
<P>
The talks can be labelled a success so long as they keep on
talking to find solutions to the conflicts, said a Kenyan Foreign
Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
The 14-year-long Sudanese war, which has claimed more than 1.3
million lives in the country, cannot be stopped in one day, and
the road to Sudan peace is surely long and uneven, he told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that the SPLA see the negotiations as a
sideshow to their war effort, while Khartoum is trying to woo a
truce so as to recover itself from current military weakness and
international isolation.
</P>
<P>
When the date for the talks was fixed late last month, it did
not prevent the SPLA from re-launching fierce attacks on
provincial capital Juba in the south. SPLA's northern ally, the
National Democratic Alliance, now poses a serious threat to the
eastern Roseires Dam, Khartoum's main power source.
</P>
<P>
Khartoum, in response, started an intensive campaign to
recruit more than four million youths by the end of this year.
Sudan's National Assembly passed a resolution two weeks ago
calling for all national resources to be put into the war effort.
</P>
<P>
At the IGAD summit here in July, the Sudanese government
accepted the Declaration of Principles drafted by IGAD leaders in
1994 as the basis for peace talks, making it possible to re-start
the IGAD mediation for ending the protracted war in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The document recognizes the right of self-determination for
the southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's civil war has displaced tens of thousands of civilians
since 1983 when the SPLA fought against Islamic-backed Khartoum
for a secular state and more autonomy in the Christian-dominated
south.
</P>
<P>
This time, however, observers still see a big gap between the
requirement set by the two sides. Early last month, SPLA leader
John Garang said he was not in favor of the secession of south
from the north, adding that SPLA's goals were self-determination,
separation of state and religion, freedom of religion and more
autonomy for the south.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, the Sudanese government signed a peace
agreement with six military oppositions derived from the SPLA.
Under the accord, the south was offered a four-year period for
rehabilitation, at the end of which southern Sudan would be
allowed to hold a referendum in which southern citizens could
choose unity or separation. The agreement was refused by Garang.
</P>
<P>
The IGAD-brokered peace talks were regarded by many as a way
to repair Khartoum's relations with neighbors and to improve its
isolated status in the international sphere.
</P>
<P>
The rebel forces, who had ignored appeals for peace talks time
and again from Khartoum and international community, were under
great pressure from regional organizations and tried to seek a
way out from the dilemma.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account the remarkable differences between the two
sides, local diplomats believed that it will take many more
rounds of negotiations to end the Sudan conflicts and reach a
consensus on peace.
</P>
<P>
Besides, once the war is ceased, controvercies among the
opposition allies will surface and continue to pose a serious
threat to a lasting peace in the country.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Pledges to Stick to Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) today expressed its
determination to stick to the peace process, U.N. special envoy
to Angola Blondin Beye said today.
</P>
<P>
Beye told the press about UNITA's pledge here at the airport
after officially presenting U.N.'s Wednesday resolution of
sanctions on the former rebel movement in Angola's central city
Andulo.
</P>
<P>
According to the envoy, he had an eight-hour meeting with the
head of UNITA, during which the latter expressed the movement's
determination to stick to the peace process until final peace is
materialized.
</P>
<P>
Since U.N. sanctions might pose difficulties to its work on
peace process, Beye noted, UNITA decided to hold a high-level
meeting next Monday to discuss future work.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council Wednesday passed a resolution of
sanctions on UNITA which include the close-up of UNITA's offices
in foreign countries and a ban on UNITA leaders' foreign visits.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said today that Moscow harbors "no jealousy" towards a
better relationship between China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Primakov made the statement before winding up his three-day
visit to Egypt, the last leg of his week-long Mideast tour that
has taken him to Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Israel and the
Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to see the relationship between China and the
U.S. improving. We believe it is a factor of stability," the
Russian minister told a press conference here this morning.
</P>
<P>
"We feel no jealousy in this respect because we have very good
relationships with both China and the U.S. and we hope they will
develop further," he said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov characterized the Sino-Russian ties as "trusted
partnership aiming at strategic interaction in the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
"We think the upcoming visit to China by President Boris
Yeltsin in the near future will add a new strong stimulus in our
relationship," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president is to visit China early next month at the
invitation of President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Jiang started an eight-day trip to the U.S. on Sunday, the
first for a Chinese head of state in 12 years. Late Chinese
President Li Xiannian visited the U.S. in 1985.

ATHENS, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis said today that recent attacks from aboard on the national
currency, drachma, had evaporated, but he could not rule out the
possibility of fresh pressure in the future.
</P>

Meanwhile, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas today
stressed that the government would resist any moves by speculators
to dictate new economic policies.
</P>
<P>
Greek equities ended the week sharply lower today, reflecting
market worries over a sharp rise in domestic interbank interest
rates.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Nigerian Parties Unconcerned About </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Political parties in Nigeria
have remained unconcerned about the choice made by the head of
state General Sani Abacha to run for the presidential election
next year.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the much-talked-about issue during their tour of
the United States, party officials put the national interest
above all, saying that a capable man is needed, the News Agency
of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
Prince Segun Seriki of the National Center Party of Nigeria
(NCP) said that Abacha's presidential candidature was not an
issue of concern in the country.
</P>
<P>
"For now General Abacha is doing very well, but I must point
out that what we are now emphasizing is to put aside personal
interest so that we can have a democratic set-up that will
endure," said the NCP spokesman.
</P>
<P>
His counterpart of the Congress for National Concensus
(CNC), Chief M.C.K. Ajuluchukwu, shared his view.
</P>
<P>
The head of state, like any other Nigerian, had the right to
contest, although he had not said he was going to do so, he said.
</P>
<P>
"What we need most in Nigeria is peace and stability because
it is the only way we can attract investors and our friends."
</P>
<P>
According to him, the country is making methodical progress in
the transition to civil rule program which began with non-party
elections in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Ajuluchukwu assured that his party was going to field a
presidential candidate to contest against those of other parties.
</P>
<P>
Prince Pat Abil, who represented the Democratic Party of
Nigeria said his party had invited General Abacha to join.
</P>
<P>
"It believed only he or a retired general would be able to do
what Nigeria needed at the moment," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the military administration's three-year
transition program, a president will be elected to take over
power on October 1 next year.
</P>
<P>
There have been pros and cons as to whether Abacha should quit
the military and run for presidency.
</P>
<P>
Abacha himself said earlier this year that it was a thing one
should think about and would be decided by his constituency.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that Abacha's attitude has caused limited
response from politicians in the country because many believe the
general is able to overrun any rivals if he is ready to do so.
</P>
<P>
The words of Festus Okubor, publicity secretary for the
Grass-roots Democratic Movement, might be of help in expressing
the view of such people.
</P>
<P>
"We have already narrowed it to the kind of candidate who can
give stability to the democratic process and make soldiers stay
in the barracks," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Attaches Importance to Protection of Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking at the Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and
Cultural) of the fifty-second session of the General Assembly,
Sun Ang said the Chinese Government had taken steps and
measures to create a favorable social environment to facilitate
children's protection. Such measures covered areas ranging from
legislation, administration, judicial work to society and
families.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Sun Ang said, China had established coordinating
agencies for children's work at central and local government
levels and enacted the law on Protection of Minors, the Law
on the Health of Mother and Infants, the Law on free education
and the law on Adoption.
</P>
<P>
Sun said as these legal instruments contained comprehensive
provisions on the survival, protection and development of
children, they constituted a rather complete legal system for
the protection of children's rights.
</P>
<P>
Sun said, furthermore, the Chinese Government had formulated
and promulgated "the Strategic Outline for the Development of
Children in China in 1990s". All this had provided a social,
scientific and legal basis for the work on children as the
society's responsibility.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegate said that China had always attached
importance to international cooperation on the protection of
children as evidenced by the fact that it had long maintained
effective cooperation with the relevant UN agencies.
</P>
<P>
Sun said since the signing and ratification of the Convention
on the Rights of the Child, the Chinese Government had
integrated its commitments under the convention into its
national efforts for the protection of children.
</P>
<P>
He said children's cause was the common cause of all
countries and China was willing to cooperate with all countries
and international agencies in the continued efforts to create a
better future for children in the world.

<HEADLINE> US Sets New Goal of Eliminating Land Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright today said the United States has set a new goal to rid
the world of land mines by 2010.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is today setting the goal of eliminating the
threat posed by land mines to civilians... by the end of the next
decade," Albright said at a State Department regular briefing.
"This call... is based on the premise that the best way to protect
civilians from land mines is to pull mines from the soil like the
noxious weeds that they are."
</P>
<P>
Last month, the United States refused to endorse a newly
negotiated global treaty to ban land mines on grounds that such
weapons are needed on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the Clinton administration has appointed Karl F.
Inderfurth, assistant secretary of state, to serve as the new
special representative of the U.S. president and secretary of
state for global humanitarian de-mining to coordinate in carrying
out the goal, initiated by President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
There will also be a panel compromising "distinguished
Americans" to provide advice and help mobilize support for the
global banning of land mines, she added.
</P>
<P>
