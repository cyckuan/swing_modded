CELTICS FALTER AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A look of disbelief mixed with frustration crossed the
face of every Boston player as the final minutes elapsed in their
contest against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   During stoppages in play, they stared blankly at each other,
hands on hips. The Celtics were left to face a numbing reality.
Once again, they put themselves in position for another
disappointing loss. Once again, the played nearly three quarters of
solid basketball only to watch their lead disappear in agonizing
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   For the second night in a row, Boston was faced with the
possibility of another fourth-quarter collapse and could not
respond. The result was a devastating 94-84 loss that extended the
Celtics' losing streak to three and pushed them back to .500. The
threat of an early season tailspin looms.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics squandered a respectable 14-point, third-quarter
lead, watching their opponent draw even 2:40 into the fourth
quarter. They were outrebounded 30-9 in the second half, and 16-6
in the final frame as they slipped farther and farther behind the
Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   The game at sparkling new Phillips Arena before 13,736 fans was
deja vu for the Celtics with the memory of Friday's 21-point
collapse against Milwaukee still fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Only this time they didn't have as far to fall. Now, Boston has
a lot longer to think about its final-quarter failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a good basketball team and right now we're not putting
it together for four quarters,'' said Antoine Walker, who finished
with 16 points, but only one basket in the fourth. ``We've got to
look ourselves in the mirror right now and find out what the
problem is. We have to figure out what we're doing wrong and try to
correct it.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the first player to the last player, we've got to look
ourselves in the mirror. The good thing is we've got a week off to
figure out what the mistakes are. You're working so hard for three
quarters, trying to get the lead and then you blow it. It hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston entered a scoring drought after Dana Barros hit a
3-pointer with 1:57 left in the third quarter. The trey gave the
Celtics their second 14-point lead (73-59). But then, the lead
rapidly disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Free throws by Dikembe Mutombo, Lorenzen White, and a 3-pointer
by Isaiah Rider closed the gap to 5 points. Time expired in the
third with Kenny Anderson launching an unsuccessful, off-balance
jump shot. The Hawks celebrated their comeback on the way back to
the bench.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics' scorers didn't find the basket until Pervis Ellison
hit two free throws in the fourth with 10:07 left to stop an 11-0
Hawk run and push the Celtics' lead back to 3 points. But it was
not enough to get Boston back on track.
</P>
<P>
   A Rider jumper gave the Hawks a 2-point lead with 8:30 left to
play, breaking a 75-75 tie and pushing the home team ahead for
good.
</P>
<P>
   A jumper and free throw by Rider with 1:20 left gave Atlanta a
8-point lead. Before the final buzzer, the Hawks pushed the lead to
10 points with free throws. Rider, the Hawks' leading scorer, saved
his best for last. He poured in 13 of his game-high 30 points in
the final quarter. Mutombo, who leads the league in rebounding,
posted 17 boards.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson led the Celtics with 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understood that we weren't playing so well, and they
weren't playing so well,'' said Rider. ``But we were playing well
enough to get the game. When we got to within 3, at that point in
time, I knew it was a game. I just decided to turn up the pace a
little bit and pick it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to be more aggressive and kept the defense on their
toes a little bit instead of playing passive. The good thing was we
responded on defense as well as offense, and that's why we got over
the hump. It was a great team performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the Cetlics had the better team play. Poor ball
movement was a problem in the second-half demise of the Celtics
against the Bucks Friday night, so the visitors looked to reverse
the trend against the Hawks. The visitors' first basket came after
a good team effort. After grabbing and offensive rebound following
a Walker miss, Ellison looked toward the basket, but thought better
of taking a shot and dished the ball to Anderson waiting at the
foul line. The guard converted on the open shot and Ellison drew
praise from Pitino for a ``nice play.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino continued to appluad the teamwork as they opened up an
8-point gap (20-12) with 4:36 left to play in the first quarter.
Boston started a mini-run when Vitaly Potapenko entered the game,
replacing Ellison who sustained a gash above his right eye that
required three stiches.
</P>
<P>
   On his first offensive move of the game, Potapenko drove to the
basket then kicked the ball out to Andrian Griffin (14 points) for
a wide-open 3-pointer. Boston's next time down the court, Potapenko
passed to Walker who made an easy layup. The forward made a
3-pointer to cap the run.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hawks battled back behind the shot-making of Alan
Henderson and Rider, tying the score with 2:44 left in the first.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics responded with increased defensive pressure,
allowing the Hawks to score just one more basket before the end of
the first frame. Boston, behind the fresh legs of Dana Barros and
Tony Battie, opened a 28-22 lead by the end of the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks made a short-lived comeback at the start of the
second, closing to within 2 points (28-26).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our own fault,'' said Pitino of the collapse. ``We ran
out of gas and got killed on the backboards. They deserved to win.
The mentally tough team wins it.''

MAVERICKS FIND A CURE CALLED THE BULLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Mavericks were sick. They were hurting. A home game
against the Chicago Bulls was just what the coach ordered.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks got a feel-good, 95-83 victory against the Bulls
yesterday before a Reunion Arena crowd of 14,436.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a must-win for us,'' Mavericks center Shawn Bradley
said. ``It was Chicago, who's not doing very well this year, but if
you let them stay in the game they might be able to get you late.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, forward Cedric Ceballos was filling up the
garbage can with Kleenex in his battle with the flu, and guard
Steve Nash was in the training room for treatment on his sprained
right ankle. Guard Robert Pack (right groin) did not dress, and
forward Gary Trent (left hamstring) still is on the injured list.
</P>
<P>
   But after suiting up the NBA-minimum eight players the past two
games, the Mavericks took what they could get. Ceballos played 24
minutes and produced 10 points, and Nash was good for 35 minutes,
seven points and seven assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just so happy to have some players back,'' Mavericks
coach Don Nelson said. ``They're not sharp. We proved that. But
it's good to have them back on the floor, and hopefully, it'll be
downhill a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks entered with a five-game losing streak. The Bulls
entered with a six-game losing streak. Somebody had to lose.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls, six-time NBA champions this decade, are not a shell
of themselves. They are mere memories of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls were so bad they threatened a team record for fewest
points in a quarter. Chicago scored four points in the final 57.4
seconds of the third quarter to give it 10 points, four better than
the franchise low set against Miami on Nov. 6, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know that,'' Bulls guard Hersey Hawkins said.
``But we've come out probably four or five times this year and not
played particularly well in the third quarter. It's nothing new. I
don't think they were doing anything particularly special. I think
we just missed a lot of shots.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls (1-12) dictated the tempo in the first half. They
didn't run, which allowed them to hide their deficiencies and stay
within 47-46 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was going to kind of be like that, so we had to
kind of just fight through it,'' Mavericks guard Erick Strickland
said. ``That was all we could do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks (5-9) continued their second-quarter struggles.
They hit their average of 23 points in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't start out that way. The Mavericks hit eight of their
first 10 field-goal attempts to go up 41-32 with 5:40 remaining in
the half. But the Bulls went on a 12-0 run to take their first lead
of the game. During that 4:01 stretch, the Mavericks were 0-for-8
from the field and had two turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   The third quarter, however, belonged to the Mavericks. The Bulls
made only three of their first 17 shots after halftime and had five
turnovers in falling behind, 69-53.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks' 7-foot duo of Dirk Nowitzki and Bradley
dominated. Nowitzki outscored the Bulls, 11-10, in the third
quarter, and Bradley had two of his five blocks and six of his 17
points.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls, however, left complaining about the officiating. In
the second half, the Mavericks were called for only two fouls, and
the Bulls never went to the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen this ever in my life,'' Bulls forward Dickey
Simpkins said. ``I guess there's always a first for something in
the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   There also is a worst in the NBA, and right now, it's the Bulls.

AGGIES, LONGHORNS SERVED STATE PROUDLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There have been many times when I've been proud to call myself a
Texan, but perhaps never more so than over the past week as the
tragic events at the Texas A&AMP;M bonfire site played themselves out.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional period culminated Friday with A&AMP;M's gallant
comeback against Texas. By then I thought it didn't matter any more
who won the game. I was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies' victory was right for all the right reasons. Or at
least 12 good ones that I can think of off the top of my head.
</P>
<P>
   Really, nothing would have changed emotionally if the Longhorns
had won, except that the Aggies ``needed'' to win this time; they
needed it to make a statement of their feelings, their emotions,
their sadness, their love for lost comrades.
</P>
<P>
   Even Texas and its fans must have felt it. What a moment when
the Longhorns band played ``Amazing Grace'', raised the Aggies'
flag high and lowered their own. What a classy statement of
heartfelt friendship.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies' archrivals were saying, in so many words, that they
recognized that something much more important than a football game
was at stake. They were saying in a gesture far greater than words
that they understood, they cared, and as fellow Texans and fellow
human beings, they were standing beside the Aggies in their time of
sorrow and grief.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures we have seen from College Station have spoken to
our hearts: Aggie football players, shouldering timbers to help in
the rescue efforts; the bouquets of flowers, the remembrances left
by devastated students at the bonfire site; the sea of candles at
Thursday night's vigil; the tears streaming down the face of A&AMP;M
quarterback Randy McCown in the wake of the Aggies' victory.
</P>
<P>
   We sometimes become so engrossed in our petty little games and
rivalries that we forget the things that really matter. That point
was driven home in a dramatic and horrible way, but to their
everlasting credit, those who were at the center of the tragedy,
whatever their affiliation or school colors, responded with
dignity, grace and compassion.
AFC suspect Sorry, AFC, but the Cowboys' 20-0 butt-kicking of Jimmy
Johnson's Dolphins on Thursday throws your entire conference into
``suspect'' status. Yeah, yeah, so the AFC has all these eight-win
teams. So what?
</P>
<P>
   If the Cowboys can push the Dolphins, supposedly a solid AFC
Super Bowl contender, around as they did using a plain-vanilla
offensive game plan and with two of their top three cornerbacks
sidelined, you have to wonder what's real and what's cardboard over
there.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the NFC isn't dead after all.
</P>
<P>
   And the manipulative, lip-smacking Johnson may be the only man
in America this side of Don King who can actually make Jerry Jones
look like a sympathetic figure.
A young pitching star? The Rangers have been tentatively penciling
in left-hander Matt Perisho as their fifth starter going into
spring training, but Doug Davis' splendid season in the Arizona
Fall League may give them at least one other option.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, also a left-hander, was the league's pitcher of the year
while tying for first in the league with five victories and
finishing fifth with a 2.25 earned-run average over a
league-leading 36 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doug Davis knows how to pitch,'' says Chris Cron, who managed
Rangers prospect-laden Mesa. ``He's got a bulldog mentality. He
competes like crazy, and he's got good stuff to go along with
that.''
Nervous days Adrian Beltre's grievance against the Dodgers for
signing him to a contract when he was only 15, a clear violation of
major-league rules, has a lot of scouts nervously checking their
hole cards.
</P>
<P>
   Signing Caribbean players before their 16th birthdays is a more
common practice than anyone would care to admit.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Beltre happily took the money he was offered
and now has bitten the hand that brought him the dough in order to
play the system and become a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Makes you wonder how many other Latin players are scrambling for
their real birth certificates now.
A Rose by any other name ... You figure Pete Rose really wants his
case against baseball settled?
</P>
<P>
   Look at it this way: Rose's national TV confrontation with
interviewer Jim Gray during the World Series has brought him
sympathy and, even more important, more lucrative paydays as he has
become more in demand than ever.
</P>
<P>
   But once his situation regarding the Hall of Fame is resolved,
he knows he'll need to secure another managing job because out of
sight is out of mind, and he'll be hard-pressed to continue
commanding the $20,000-$50,000 fee he's charging now to appear at
baseball card shows.
</P>
<P>
   Best estimates have Rose pulling in in excess of $1 million a
year in appearance fees and assorted other gigs.
Welcome to Windy Losersville So you're worried about the Stars'
fall from grace, the Cowboys' mediocre season, the forgettable Mavs
and the fact that the Rangers can't get past the first round of the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Cheer up, it could be worse. Chicagoans woke up this morning
with their NBA Bulls and their NHL Blackhawks both in last place in
their respective leagues, and the Bears lost to the Lions on
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   And we haven't even gotten to the White Sox or Cubs yet.
A turkey a day A video clip on a sportscast in the greater LA area
recently showed George W. Bush _ yep, our guv and would-be
president _ ``turkey bowling.'' Yes, he was actually rolling frozen
turkeys, but I wouldn't say he was throwing strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was from a TV show filmed at an amusement park in
Arlington, Texas, a few years ago, when Bush owned the Texas
Rangers,'' turkey bowling inventor Derrick Johnson told Randy
Youngman of the ``Orange County Register''.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, host Norm Hitzges can be heard predicting that the
footage would someday sabotage Bush's presidential aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, Johnson says, are clamoring for copies of the
videotape.
</P>
<P>
   The Allison Brigade There are more than a few folks in Lubbock
who are wondering why Texas Tech doesn't have former Red Raiders
quarterback Rodney Allison on its list of coaching candidates to
replace Spike Dykes.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Allison is on the same Clemson staff as Rich
Rodriguez, the leading candidate for the job. Allison is coaching
defense, but he's an offensive coach _ he was Brett Favre's
quarterback coach at Southern Mississippi _ and his resume includes
stops at Duke, Southern Miss., Auburn and Clemson.
</P>
<P>
   Insiders say Tech officials have been contacted by Favre and
Jets coach Bill Parcells recommending that Allison be interviewed,
and athletic director Gerald Myers has indicated that he'll be
contacting some new candidates this week. But the fact that
Allison's name hasn't come up previously is not a good sign.
A sorry Starry night The sad thing isn't that the Stars are taking
so long to get motivated again about defending their Stanley Cup,
it's that they're playing with so little heart and emotion.
</P>
<P>
   They won last season because they were willing to outwork every
team they played. They had pride in themselves and in each other.
</P>
<P>
   It is becoming more and more obvious as this goes on that they
don't have the grit or determination to repeat what they
accomplished a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The party's over, in more ways than one.
REVO'S RIMSHOTS
As deep as it gets When the Lakers' crowd recently included Dustin
Hoffman, Jack Nicholson and Dyan Cannon, ``Los Angeles Times''
columnist Bill Plaschke was forced to conclude that the crowd had
much better depth than the team's roster.
Some eggs with your ham? Anybody else think John Madden's humor has
gotten as dry as the turkey legs he drools over every Thanksgiving
Day? Maybe he should switch to ham for a change. For obvious
reasons.
The Tiger dilemma The best chance the PGA has of selling fans on
the tight competitiveness of its players is those huge appearance
fees that keep drawing Tiger Woods across the Atlantic to Europe.
Lawrence of San Francisco Do not argue with a 49ers' fan about
Lawrence Phillips' impact on the team before he was released. It
was, after all, Phillips who missed the block that got Steve Young
kayoed, maybe for the last time.
Did I hear right? Lennox Lewis says he'd like to fight Mike Tyson
now that he has disposed of Evander Holyfield. It's a fight that
could mean big money, but littler ears.
Mom's viewpoint Stephon Marbury of the hapless 2-11 New Jersey Nets
received an interesting pep talk from his mom in front of reporters
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are a winner, and the other guys on this team don't
care,'' Mabel Marbury told him. ``It's not important to them. All
you need is some help.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it chicken soup for the struggling NBA soul. I'm sure
Stephon's teammates understood.

   Ottawa suspends wayward forward Alexei Yashin for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado goalie Patrick Roy allows seven goals in a game.
</P>
<P>
   The defending Stanley Cup champion] Stars drop to the bottom of
the Pacific Division.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the NHL season is only a quarter of the way through and
we've already seen plenty of wacky headlines. Here's a few more we
could be seeing in the next 60-some games:
</P>
<P>
   San Jose's Owen Nolan edges Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr for
scoring title
</P>
<P>
   OK, it's got to happen sometime, and Nolan has shown himself up
to the task playing on the Sharks' first line with Vincent
Damphousse. What were the Canadiens thinking when they got rid of
him?
</P>
<P>
   New York Rangers trade for both Alexei Yashin and Keith Primeau
</P>
<P>
   Both are sitting out demanding oodles of money. Coincidentally,
the Rangers love spending oodles and oodles of money. Their
payroll, by far the biggest in the NHL, has resulted in a
well-below .500 record. And adding two spoiled whiners is just the
thing this overpaid, underachieving bunch would do.
</P>
<P>
   Stars defenseman Derian Hatcher snubbed again; Norris Trophy
once again given to non-defensive defenseman
</P>
<P>
   Ask around the league who the best defenseman in the NHL is, and
Stars captain Hatcher gets mentioned a lot. Look at the voting for
the Norris Trophy, supposedly given to the NHL's best defenseman,
and it's tough to find his name at all. The award is all about
scoring, a bit strange considering the role of the defenseman first
and foremost is to prevent goals.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia finally gets to Cup Finals The Flyers got off to a
rough start this season but have apparently made the necessary
adjustments. A lineup featuring captain Eric Lindros, John LeClair,
Mark Recchi and Rod Brind'Amour has to break through sometime, and
this just could be that season.
</P>
<P>
   New York Islanders disappear for 10 days; nobody notices
</P>
<P>
   No team in the NHL has scored less goals or won fewer games than
the Islanders have this season. The problem is an old one, though.
If a team stinks and nobody pays to see it, does it really stink?
The few fans who do show up will tell you the answer is a
resounding ``yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada calls for national day of mourning
</P>
<P>
   If the season were to end today, all three of the California
teams (Los Angeles, San Jose and Anaheim) would make the playoffs
while historic, proud franchises like Montreal and Edmonton are
struggling to reach .500. And they thought the Cup vacationing in
Texas was bad?
Anaheim star Selanne even surprises himself It's pop quiz time with
guest Teemu Selanne of the Anaheim Mighty Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Who has scored the most goals in the NHL since 1992?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, Hull?'' Selanne said, guessing Stars sniper
Brett Hull had to be close since he's nearing 600 goals.
</P>
<P>
   No, and imagine the surprise when Selanne learned that the
answer was himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never would have guessed that,'' Selanne said.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Selanne has scored 324 goals since arriving on the NHL
scene in 1992. He also has the fourth-highest goals-per-game (.636)
and sixth-highest point-per-game (1.32) ratios in NHL history. He
ranks second among Anaheim's all-time leaders in goals (174) and
assists (185). He also led all NHL goal scorers last season with
47.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a player who doesn't really consider himself a pure
goal scorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys have great shots. Some guys have soft hands. Some
guys are able to read the play and be in the right spot,'' Selanne
said. ``I don't have to shoot it very hard so I have to put the
puck in the right place.''
</P>
<P>
   The puck hadn't been going in the right place _ the goal _
before Selanne arrived Friday in Texas to play the Stars. He hadn't
scored since Nov. 7 when he had a goal and assist against Edmonton.
Eight games passed, a groin pull sidelining him for three of them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, five goal-less, scoreless games is a lot for Selanne.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure if that's a record, but if that is, I don't want
to have it,'' Selanne said.
</P>
<P>
   If it was, he quickly ended it by scoring three goals against
the Stars. He called the hat trick a ``confidence boost,'' bumping
him into the top 10 in the NHL in scoring, a place he's usually in
since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   So back to the quiz.
</P>
<P>
   Who do you think are the best goal scorers in the NHL, Selanne?
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter Bondra, \RJohn\S LeClair, \RPavel\S Bure, Keith Tkachuk,
Hull. There are a lot of guys,'' Selanne said.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong again.
</P>
<P>
   He forgot to include himself.  &LR; subheds:Around the East A quick
glance at standings seems to indicate that maybe the Southeast
Division isn't the exactly the toughest. The division-leading
Florida Panthers have the least amount of points of any division
leader and only two of the five teams are above .500. If the Stars
were in the Southeast, they'd be in third instead of last.
</P>
<P>
   So imagine the Tampa Bay Lightning's frustration.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't won a game against a divisional opponent this
season, the streak of futility extending after Friday's 3-3 tie
with the Carolina Hurricanes. ``We've got to realize all division
games are worth four points,'' said defenseman Petr Svoboda. ``And
there's no doubt we haven't played well against our division the
last few years. I know we're a young team, but if we work real
hard, our focus should be on getting to the top of this division.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Lindros almost wasn't a Philadelphia Flyer.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers and Carolina Hurricanes reportedly came close to
making a blockbuster trade last week that would've sent Lindros to
Carolina and unsigned restricted free agent Keith Primeau to
Philadelphia. Primeau wants $5 million a season and said he won't
return to Carolina.  &LR; subheds:Around the West Some guys have in-laws
that inspire jokes. Some guys have in-laws that inspire scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for Phoenix Coyotes forward Jeremy Roenick, he's one of
the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Roenick said he talked to his father-in-law about how tough it
has become to score a hat trick in the NHL before Thursday's game
against New Jersey. Roenick then went out and notched his seventh
hat trick, his first as a Coyote and his first since Feb. 24, 1994,
and his eighth on Friday against Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really not a guy who scores in bunches,'' Roenick said.
``It's ironic we were talking about it and it happened. I feel real
fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado has been in survival mode for most of this season,
trying to hang in until No. 1 center Peter Forsberg returned. Well,
he's baaaaaack.
</P>
<P>
   Forsberg played in last night's] game against Calgary, saying he
wanted to ``start at home` after having shoulder surgery that
sidelined him for the first 23 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shoulder feels good,'' Forsberg said. ``It's been a while
since I've played. Everybody else has been playing so I know I'll
be struggling at the beginning but I'm excited to be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Not as excited as the Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   Forsberg led Colorado in points (97) and assists (67) last
season, adding an NHL-high 24 points in postseason action.

NORTH CAROLINA-CHARLOTTE BEATS PEPPERDINE
</HEADLINE>

By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU _ The Sparkletts Invitational tournament doesn't work
like other four-team men's basketball tournaments. Here, the host
plays the best team in the first round instead of in the
championship.
</P>
<P>
   So Pepperdine played North Carolina-Charlotte on Saturday and
lost 80-74.
</P>
<P>
   Many, including the coaches, thought this was to be today's
marquee matchup. But television reared its head and mandated this
should be the big first-day game.
</P>
<P>
   It happened last year. Pepperdine faced Rhode Island in the
first round, when Jim Harrick returned to the area, and Fox Sports
televised it.
</P>
<P>
   This year, UNC-Charlotte coach Bobby Lutz was told that his
49ers _ which have reached the NCAA second round each of the past
two seasons _ would open with Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make the decision,'' he said. ``When you're the visitors,
you do what you're told.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, said Pepperdine coach Jan van Breda Kolff, no
network televised this contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we knew, we should've flip-flopped,'' van Breda Kolff
said.
</P>
<P>
   Only the 1,683 at Firestone Fieldhouse saw Pepperdine (2-1)
trail by 10 for much of the game, only to go on a 19-8 run in a
6-minute, 42-second span of the second half to take a 72-71 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't enough, however, as the 49ers (2-0) scored the game's
final seven points in the last 1:33 and moved to today's 5 p.m.
championship against St. Bonaventure, which UNC-Charlotte already
has defeated this season. Pepperdine meets Colorado State at 2:30
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Waves know what it's like to play an established NCAA
Tournament team. They can point to the little things that made a
difference:
</P>
<P>
   __Kenny Whitehead, a career 31-percent free-throw shooter, made
all six of his attempts to build the 49ers' lead to 65-53 with 9:14
to play.
</P>
<P>
   __In the first half, UNC-Charlotte went 7 of 15 from the 3-point
line. Jobey Thomas, who sank the eventual game-icing 3-pointer with
52.4 seconds to play, and James Zimmerman were a combined 9 of 15
from beyond the arc. Zimmerman finished with 19 points and Thomas
had 16.
</P>
<P>
   __Pepperdine started slowly, falling behind 24-14 with 8:26 left
in the first half, and trailed 41-32 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to pull it all together,'' said Pepperdine forward
Kelvin Gibbs, who led the Waves with 19 points. ``Don't matter if
we come back unless we win.''
</P>
<P>
   A positive: center Nick Sheppard scored 10 consecutive points in
the second half and finished with 14, matching his highest as a
Wave. Sheppard scored a career-high 19 while playing for Louisiana
State three seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
   But again, as van Breda Kolff said, ``For us, it's all about
winning. No moral victories.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even if the tournament runs differently than others.

DUKE BEATS USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ With eight minutes left and USC closing in on
Duke, Jarvis Turner pleaded with the Trojans to dig in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three stops, fellas,'' Turner said as the Trojans took
defensive position.
</P>
<P>
   Well, so much for that.
</P>
<P>
   A few seconds later, Mick Dunleavy sank an open 3-pointer. A
minute after that, Dunleavy hit another deep 3, then forced a steal
and skipped a nice bounce pass to Chris Carrawell for an easy
layup.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, a manageable eight-point deficit for the Trojans
was a huge 13-point hole. They never recovered in an 81-68 loss at
the sixth annual John Wooden Classic before 11,847 Saturday at the
Pond.
</P>
<P>
   USC (2-3) had hoped playing 16th-ranked Duke would offer clues
to its identity. The Trojans might not like what they found out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about our offense; we'll score points,'' USC
coach Henry Bibby said. ``My concerns are will we make a defensive
stop when we need to, will we get a rebound when we have to have
one?''
</P>
<P>
   They didn't Saturday, not at the critical moments to which Bibby
alluded, and especially not during the sequence in which Duke took
control.
</P>
<P>
   Just prior to Dunleavy's daggers, USC got two dunks from Jeff
Trepagnierto cut the lead to 65-57. The crowd was hyped. USC's
reserves were up off the bench and the Trojans had momentum. But
two mental blunders _ USC double-teamed in the paint, leaving
Dunleavy wide open on the wing _ undid the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually after a couple of dunks like that, the team buckles
down and plays some defense,'' Trepagnier said. ``But (Dunleavy)
hit a couple of big shots and that killed it right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunleavy, a gangly 6-foot-7 guard, finished with 13 points, four
steals, five assists and five rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should never lose a shooter like that,'' Bibby said.
``Those are some of the mental things we've got to work on.''
</P>
<P>
   USC got 19 points and eight rebounds from Sam Clancy and 17
points from Brian Scalabrine. Unfortunately for the Trojans, 13
came in the first half. Scalabrine disappeared in the second under
the defensive pressure of Shane Battier, Duke's designated stopper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew after I got 10 points, (Battier) basically decided I
wasn't going to score anymore,'' Scalabrine said. ``And that's
basically what he did, shut me down.''
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine's comment seemed to irk Bibby, who felt his junior
forward was giving Battier too much respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're one of the best players in the country,'' Bibby told
Scalabrine. ``Nobody can stop you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans stayed close in the first half, trailing by just six
at intermission. They shot reasonably well overall _ finishing at a
respectable 45 percent _ and weren't beaten badly on the boards,
35-33.
</P>
<P>
   They just couldn't get it done when it counted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duke has that mystique,'' Bibby said. ``Like an extra hand
guiding (the ball) in when a shot bounces off the rim a couple of
times.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the Duke powerhouse of years past. The Blue Devils
have four freshmen playing significant minutes after losing four
key players from last year's national-champion runner-up. Duke
dropped its first two games of the year before evening things out
with wins over Army and Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils came in with just as many questions as USC but
leave as an improving team.
</P>
<P>
   Carrawell had 24 points. Nate James had 14 points and seven
assists, hurting USC with his dribble penetration. Freshman point
guard Jason Williams added 13 points. And of course there was
Dunleavy, whose father, Mike, the Portland Trail Blazers head
coach, was watching from the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five games into his college career, to be making plays like
that is huge,'' said Duke coach Mike Krzyzweski. ``I thought the
two shots he hit broke the game open for us.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ And to think, coach Mike Montgomery was
actually worried that Stanford wouldn't stand up to Auburn's
physical play.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out that Auburn should've been concerned. Stanford
manhandled the No. 2 Tigers, crushing them on the boards and
suffocating them defensively in a 67-58 victory Saturday in the
sixth annual John Wooden Classic at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   No. 7 Stanford (5-0) solidified its position among the nation's
elite using the size of former Harvard-Westlake High twin towers
Jason and Jarron Collins, the timely play of freshman Curtis
Borchardt (15 points) and the hustle of fellow freshman Casey
Jacobsen to frustrate Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal now has wins over nationally ranked Duke and
Auburn, the latter of which has four starters back from a club that
won the Southeastern Conference Championship and reached the Sweet
16 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Jarron Collins had 13 points and held Tigers All-American Chris
Porter to six points on 3-of-13 shooting. Jason Collins had 12
points and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to get beat on the boards and we wanted to get
back in transition defense, because that's where Auburn beats
you,'' Jarron Collins said. ``I thought we did a great job in both
of those areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Auburn (2-1) got 21 points from Scott Pohlman and 15 points from
Doc Robinson. But the Tigers couldn't overcome Porter's poor
shooting and Stanford's size.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I was physical enough,'' Porter said. ``I was
getting open shots but they just weren't falling.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford outrebounded Auburn 46-29 and held the Tigers to a
miserable 29 percent shooting from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took it to us in the paint,'' said Auburn coach Cliff
Ellis. ``That was the game. When we play against physical teams, we
have to hold our ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Borchardt, 6-foot-10 freshman from Washington, broke a 56-56 tie
with a three-pointer with 1:35 remaining. The Cardinal outscored
the Tigers 11-2 the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ability to stay with them on the boards was critical,''
Montgomery said. ``It came down to toughness and stops in the paint
and big plays on our part.''

UCLA ROUTS IONA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Maybe practice doesn't make perfect, but it sure
beats the alternative.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA Bruins, so ragged in the season-opening victory, looked
like a very different team Saturday in their 105-73 victory over
Iona before a Pauley Pavilion crowd of 7,273.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA coach Steve Lavin credited the improved play to finally
having enough bodies healthy for a week of full five-on-five
practice, but he seemed unsure just what to make of the 32-point
victory.
</P>
<P>
   First Lavin called it progress, but pretty soon he had elevated
it to a breakthrough, and then a model for how the 13th-ranked
Bruins want to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a breakthrough in practice, and I think you saw
a breakthrough in our game,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   This game saw the Bruins (2-0) play hard, and mostly under
control, the entire night. It saw all 10 Bruins on the roster play
at least 14 minutes, and all contribute. It saw their press lead to
28 Iona turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   And it saw some uplifting performances from two Bruins who had
struggled in the opening victory over Fairfield at Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Junior Earl Watson, battling a sore tailbone, right elbow and
the ghost of Baron Davis, hit only 3 of 12 field-goal attempts in
the opener and a couple of fans taunted him. Earlier in the week,
he said the tailbone was bothering him to the point where he
expected to sit out and miss the first game of his UCLA career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I was going to play,'' Watson said. ``But coach
Lavin said to wait and make a decision after the last practice.
Then that practice went real well for me, and I thought I might as
well play.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the Gaels (1-2), Watson was a man who looked comfortable
and very healthy. He led the Bruins with 18 points, seven assists,
three steals and a block. And he has now started 66 consecutive
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in with a different mindset,'' Watson said. ``I knew I
wouldn't have my usual speed. I just decided to put it out of my
mind, and it ended up helping.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Young, bothered by a right thumb sprain and the tape wrapped
around it, went 0 for 6 from the field and 0 for 3 from the
free-throw line against Fairfield.
</P>
<P>
   But against Iona, Young hit 5 of 6 from beyond the 3-point line
(6 of 8 overall) and helped squash outmanned Iona's lone comeback
early in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made up my mind early, I wasn't going to let the tape affect
my game,'' Young said. ``This week was all about trying to get my
rhythm back, and it just carried over into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Lots of other Bruins contributed, too. Jerome Moiso had 14
points and 10 rebounds. Dan Gadzuric played animated, with 11
points, six rebounds and two blocks. Sean Farnham started
unexpectedly at forward, hit all three of his shots for eight
points, and grabbed five rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sean had a great week of practice and we decided to give him a
start today, and he gave us a lift,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, for just the second game of the season, the Bruins
looked fairly polished.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way we want to play, to take advantage of our
depth,'' Lavin said. ``We hope over the course of the game, we can
wear people out. Tonight was like a model for the way we'd like to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   For Iona, it was something less. Former NBA player Jeff Ruland
returned to his alma mater and led the Gaels to a 16-14 mark last
season. He returns five starters, but only forward Tariq Kirksay
was a consistent threat against the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Kirksay led everyone with 24 points, 15 coming in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA led by nine at that point (43-34), but Watson and the
Bruins kept stretching the lead in the second half, and Iona faded
under the wave of UCLA's interchangeable parts.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin called off the full-court press when the lead first hit 30
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I see why they are ranked (13th) in the country,'' Ruland
said. ``They have tremendous athletic ability, they played hard
overall and are a good defensive team.''

YOUNGER TWIN TOWER AT STANFORD GRABS SPOTLIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It used to be the only time Jarron Collins'
name came before his twin brother Jason's was in alphabetical
listings.
</P>
<P>
   Jason was born eight minutes before Jarron and pretty much
remained the pacesetter throughout the twins' high school years at
Harvard-Westlake High. It was Jason who led the Wolverines in
scoring during their consecutive state Division III championship
seasons, Jason who earned Division III Player of the Year honors,
Jason who started on a prestigious California all-star squad.
</P>
<P>
   Jason, Jason, Jason!
</P>
<P>
   Jarron had every right to feel like Jan Brady in hightops. He
had the game to be a king anywhere but in his own castle.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like it would be more of the same story when the twins
enrolled at Stanford in the fall of 1997. But you know what they
say: Every sibling has his day.
</P>
<P>
   As if anybody needed further proof that Jarron is his own
manchild, the younger twin thoroughly frustrated the best player on
the second-best team in the country Saturday at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   Jarron held Auburn forward Chris Porter without a basket in the
second half of No. 9 Stanford's 67-58 win over the Tigers at the
Wooden Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Jarron's defense on Porter was tighter than a Tupperware seal,
which explains why Porter shot as if there was a lid on the basket.
He missed five field-goal attempts in the second half and had more
fouls (three) in his final 15 minutes than points (two, on his only
trip to the foul line).
</P>
<P>
   Jarron, a jokester, has been known to pour a bucket of ice on
some poor, unsuspecting freshman who has his back turned in the
shower. He came out dead serious against Auburn and gave Porter a
different kind of cold jolt, one that was just as numbing.
</P>
<P>
   So jarring was Jarron's presence, Porter could have been
forgiven for seeing double down low even when Jason was resting on
the bench. Porter's patience went the way of his shot shortly after
he picked up his third foul, on Jarron, with 3:33 left. Jarron,
cool as an ocean breeze, made both foul shots to put the Cardinal
ahead 54-53.
</P>
<P>
   On Auburn's ensuing position, Jarron stymied Porter in the paint
and Porter responded with a sharp blow to Jarron's face. It would
have been called simple assault on the street, but the men in
stripes called nothing and so Jarron, showing admirable self
control, turned impassively and ran upcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things weren't going Porter's way,'' said Jason, proving he is
a master of understatement on top of everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind one game going badly, Jason knows about entire
seasons going awry. Saturday marked his 13th appearance in a
Cardinal uniform in three years. He was sidelined for the season
with torn cartilage in his left knee after his first game as a
freshman and suffered a season-ending right-wrist injury last
December in the seventh game of his second stab at being a
freshman.
</P>
<P>
   For the Collinses, about the only silver lining in the cloud
that hung over Jason's head his first two years in college was
Jarron got the chance to step out from his beloved twin's shadow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that might be a little true,'' Jason said. ``In high
school I scored more points. With me getting hurt, it's Jarron's
turn to be more of a scorer. He's become very comfortable in that
role.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Jarron is the leading scorer for the unbeaten Cardinal
(5-0). He took home MVP honors from a tournament in New York City
earlier this month after collecting 28 points and 16 rebounds in
victories over Duke and Iowa. Against Auburn, Jarron finished with
13 points and six rebounds, both right around his season average.
Jason added 12 points and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Tigers coach Cliff Ellis had the dazed look of a
pedestrian who didn't catch the license plate of the sedan that
struck him, shifted into reverse and hit him again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Collins twins are very, very strong and solid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yes they are. And just think how very, very strong and solid
Stanford will be when Mark Madsen, its All-America prospect at
forward, returns from a right-hamstring injury. It's enough to make
opposing Pacific-10 coaches weep, none more so than UCLA's Steve
Lavin.
</P>
<P>
   The Collins twins once expressed a keen interest in attending
UCLA. They were dined, if not wined, by Lavin's predecessor, Jim
Harrick. It was a meal that will go down in infamy as Harrick lied
in his retelling of the night on his expense report, setting off
the chain of events that led to his firing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in a blue moon, someone will bring that up,'' Jason said.
``But we've moved on.''
</P>
<P>
   Onward, upward and outward, that's the Collinses' motto. As
complementary as bookends on the court, they are competitive off
it.
</P>
<P>
   They vie for the best grade-point average _ ``We definitely try
to see who can be the better student,'' Jason said.
</P>
<P>
   They race home after practice, not to hit the books but to
continue their Nintendo wars.
</P>
<P>
   They're one of a kind, these two.

GARCIA CHIPS IN _ FOR $50,000 EAGLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIO, Calif. _ On a day filled with erratic golf and missed
opportunities, leave it to the youngest competitor in Skins Game
history to supply some much-needed dramatics Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Garcia, the 19-year-old Spanish sensation, chipped in for
eagle on the eighth hole to win $50,000. It was one of only a few
memorable shots supplied by the talented foursome of Garcia, Fred
Couples, David Duval and Mark O'Meara in this 17th edition of the
competition on the demanding Landmark Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   Couples won the most skins, worth $125,000, thanks to a birdie
putt on the first hole and another on the fifth. But he also drove
one ball out of bounds and picked up his ball after another errant
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Duval, who was shut out in 1997, still hasn't won any money. He
missed a three-footer on No. 7 to give a $75,000 skin to O'Meara,
the defending champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I anticipated David making it for sure,'' O'Meara said.
</P>
<P>
   Duval didn't seem particularly upset over his miss, just as he
appears low-key about the weekend. He hasn't played much golf since
teaming with Couples to win the Shark Shootout a couple of weeks
ago, and didn't get into Palm Springs until Thanksgiving night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any expectations one way or the other,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is clear, however: The par-72, 7,288-yard course,
which has been open for less than a month, was as difficult as the
players, who have had little practice time on it, thought it would
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, Landmark built a pretty tough course that's
different from a daily-fee club,'' Couples said. ``It's a country
club that everyone can play. You're not going to see flat bunkers
... you have fairways that give you a little bit of a chance, but
you're going to be in the rocks a lot. Which I was.
</P>
<P>
   ``The course is very, very tough and very, very good. We like
that. It could easily have been flat and made for the public to
(play) a little quicker. But if they do hit good shots, they can go
away saying, `Geez, I played the fifth hole and they made a birdie
here.' They can go away and talk about something that happened in
the Skins Game.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples started quickly by putting a 67-yard sand wedge to three
feet on the par-4, 382-yard first hole and making it for a $25,000
skin. The next three holes were haved with pars until the par-4,
471-yard fifth hole, which Couples birdied from 12 feet. That was
good for another $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara then got into the act two holes later when his par was
worth $75,000. Couples was out of hole off the tee and picked up,
Garcia was in heavy rough just off the green in two and did no
better than bogey and Duval missed another putt, this time from
three feet for a halve.
</P>
<P>
   It got interesting on the next hole, a 570-yard par 5. Couples
drove out of bounds, but Duval, Garcia and O'Meara each were in
good position off the tee. Duval's second shot was pin-high but
just left of the green, and O'Meara put his second shot in a bunker
short of the putting surface. His third shot came up 50 feet short
of the flag.
</P>
<P>
   That left it up to Garcia, who supplied the theatrics with his
35-yard sand wedge up and over a bunker and into the cup for an
eagle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to get the club under the ball,'' said Garcia,
who could not see the bottom of the flag from his position. ``When
I saw it bounce, I knew it was close.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's back nine will be worth $750,000 _ including a $200,000
``Super Skin'' on the par-5, 536-yard 18th hole _ and should lead
to better golf. The players definitely know what is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow we're playing for a ton of money,'' Couples said.
``We're all very close, even though David has nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have loved to get some more today,'' Garcia said,
``but that's the way skins is played. Somebody makes birdie and
gets all of them. I'm looking forward to tomorrow.''

O'MEARA TO CUT BACK, DUVAL TO PICK IT UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIO, Calif. _ Expect to see less of Mark O'Meara and more of
David Duval on next year's PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara, who had a difficult time living up to an impressive
1998 season that included two major championships (British Open and
Masters), will cut back his early 2000 schedule in hopes of having
a stronger finish later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fickle game, and sometimes you don't play as well as
you would like to,'' he said. ``Hopefully, next year, I can get it
straightened out. I'll play more in the states and not so much
overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval, on the other hand, had a great start _ including his
final-round 59 at the Bob Hope Classic _ but began to fade in the
summer. He said he still will participate in most of the West Coast
tournaments but plans to play more as the year goes on in hopes of
staying sharp.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the U.S. Open, I never caught a good rhythm,'' he said.
``I don't think my game was a whole lot weaker, but I didn't give
myself opportunities to build on anything from one week to the
next. I believe that's why I didn't win any golf tournaments at the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know exactly what to do, but it looks like I'm going
to have to play more in the summer months.''
</P>
<P>
   Young blood: Sergio Garcia is the youngest competitor in Skins
Game history.
</P>
<P>
   He's 19 years, 10 months and 18 days old. Tiger Woods was 20
years, 10 months and 29 days old when he played in the '96 Skins
Game.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, by the way, was born in January of 1980, the same month
Couples and O'Meara turned professional.
</P>
<P>
   Tennis anyone?: Garcia and Couples were thinking of playing some
tennis after Saturday's play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sergio's pretty quick,'' O'Meara said. ``I saw him at the
Dunhill Cup, sprinting with Michael Jordan and beating him. Maybe
he can chase down some of Fred's half-volleys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll play for some skins,'' Garcia joked.

NORTHRIDGE BEATS DOMINGUEZ HILLS

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Buzzers blared, sirens sounded, and strobe lights
flashed in all four corners of the Matadome at Cal State Northridge
on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   No, the CSUN men's basketball team did not win the Big Sky
Conference title or break some national record to trigger the
ruckus. The outside disturbances were caused by a tripped fire
alarm late in the first half. It had little effect on the Matadors,
who defeated Cal State Dominguez Hills 80-65 in CSUN's home opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable,'' CSUN coach Bobby Braswell said of the
disturbance, which was still going on after the game. ``I've seen a
lot, but I've never seen anything like that before. It was a big
distraction for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Toros, outside forces only made things worse. The
Division II school wanted an upset as badly as CSUN did last Friday
when it lost its season opener to USC.
</P>
<P>
   This time, CSUN had to protect itself against a smaller program.
The Matadors (1-1) were reminded late in the first half that the
Toros were ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   Braswell turned on the full-court press and stretched a 30-27
lead into a 44-36 margin in the final minutes of the first half.
Guard Marco McCain hit two 3-pointers during the stretch but
sprained his thumb just before halftime and was limited the rest of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors methodically put Dominguez Hills away in the second
half behind a steady offense. Meanwhile, Dominguez Hills was
limited to 39 percent shooting in the second half (11 of 28).
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we had the definite size advantage,'' said CSUN center
Brian Heinle, who had a game-high 21 points on 8-of-12 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Heinle found himself open often, as the Toros (0-2) had trouble
matching up with what was basically a five-guard offense. Dominguez
Hills' biggest player was 6-foot-5 Jason Patton, who fouled out
with 4 minutes, 18 seconds remaining after playing just 13 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of size left room in the middle for CSUN's Hewitt
Rolle, who collected a career-high 14 rebounds to go with eight
points. Rolle started both games for the Matadors this season while
Andre Larry serves a two-game suspension for playing in an
unsanctioned summer league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel comfortable starting,'' Rolle said. ``If I have to come
off the bench, I'll still feel the same way about playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors outrebounded Dominguez Hills 40-27 and shot 50.8
percent (33 of 65) from the field. The only bad news came on the
injury front. The Matadors learned 6-6 forward Jermar Welch will
have surgery on his left thumb Tuesday to repair torn ligaments he
suffered in the USC game. He will miss eight to 10 weeks.

CLIPPERS FALL TO TRAIL BLAZERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In their first bookie-proof performance of a
rapidly aging season, the Los Angeles Clippers didn't cover
anything but their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   They certainly didn't cover whatever the underdog's side of the
spread was for Saturday's Staples Center date with mighty Portland,
the Trail Blazers rolling to an 88-71 victory in front of 14,552
refund-conscious patrons.
</P>
<P>
   And the Clippers defensive coverage was a bit friendly, too, the
merciless Blazers (13-2) requiring little finesse to finish their
offensive sets. Damon Stoudamire fattened up on the generosity with
24 points, and Scottie Pippen went for 10 points, 10 assists and
nine rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Portland, which didn't need a rain check on the first crucial
shopping weekend of the season, pushed its lead to 25 midway
through the final act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight, we just kind of laid down,'' said rookie Lamar Odom,
who had six rebounds and six assists, but his 15 points came at the
mercy of 6-of-18 shooting from the field. ``I don't even know what
to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Say, goodnight.
</P>
<P>
   Portland coach Mike Dunleavy, whose team defeated Houston in
overtime Friday, was shooting for diplomacy: ``We kind of needed
any easy win.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider it done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We competed until it was 33-30 (Portland),'' said Clippers
coach Chris Ford, whose young team might have entertained a
residual funk after letting Friday's game at Seattle slip away. ``I
just wish our guys had competed; not competing is a thing I can't
accept.''
</P>
<P>
   The point total was the Clippers' bottom line for the season. A
five-point salvo during the last 34.5 seconds prevented the
Clippers from slaughtering the franchise-record for fewest points
(68).
</P>
<P>
   Their field-goal percentage (32.9) threatened to bend lower than
the Blazers will pick in next June's NBA Draft.
</P>
<P>
   They missed 12 of 25 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Their relentless sharing offense generated 11 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Their leading scorer, Derek Anderson, scored six points in 29
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers' go-to citizen, Maurice Taylor, didn't suit up for
the seventh consecutive game after spraining his left foot two
weeks ago. After having the wheel examined at halftime, Taylor is
expected to play in Tuesday's game with Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't assume anything,'' Ford said of Taylor's return,
citing conditioning and other potential hazards. ``I just wish we
had done whatever it takes to show the crowd you're working your
butt off.''
</P>
<P>
   We didn't ask any fans, but we're certain they could see a
little butt left over.

 &HT;    Coverdell serving as guiding hand to Bush camp
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Early this year, Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.) met
privately in a hotel here with members of Gov. George W. Bush's
presidential team.
</P>
<P>
   Looking down the list of 55 Republican senators, Coverdell
identified at least five and maybe as many as nine who he knew were
already supporting the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) became the 27th senator
to endorse Bush. The campaign is sitting on eight more endorsements
to roll out soon, and Coverdell is aggressively courting four or
five more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this could get to 40,'' said Coverdell. Not bad for a
body that counts two of its members, Sens. John McCain of Arizona
and Orrin Hatch of Utah, among the list of GOP presidential
aspirants.
</P>
<P>
   The strong support for Bush in the Senate is probably the most
tangible evidence of what Coverdell has managed to accomplish for
Bush since being named to the governor's presidential exploratory
committee in March.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the scenes, Coverdell also has worked tirelessly to
help Bush fashion his positions on issues. Coverdell has also made
sure that Bush understands the dynamics of Republican politics on
Capitol Hill and has served as his early warning sentinel on such
controversial issues as the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Coverdell has emerged as one of Bush's most
dependable advisers. He says he talks to Bush's campaign regularly
and to the candidate himself about every other month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have endeavored to ensure that they have a knowledge of
various legislative initiatives that are occurring here,'' said
Coverdell. ``If there is a question that arises _ `What's this
mean?' or `Is this a good way to deal with the subject?' _ we have
people who can respond to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Should Bush become the 43rd president, Coverdell is poised to
become an influential player at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to have a real entree into the Oval office,'' says
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas). ``The governor obviously
hasn't focused as much on national issues. Paul has given him a lot
of issues input, and he's just very respected by the Bush campaign
and in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison's Texas colleague, Sen. Phil Gramm, agrees: ``He will
almost certainly become George Bush's principal spokesman in the
Republican Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, Coverdell is a conduit between the Bush
campaign and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   During last month's contentious debate over the nuclear test ban
treaty, for example, Coverdell immediately alerted the Bush
campaign that 20 of the 29 senators who were publicly or privately
backing the governor opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush eventually announced his opposition to the treaty as well.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Coverdell defended Bush after the governor offended
some Republicans in Congress by criticizing GOP efforts to save
money by deferring earned income tax credit payments to the working
poor.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush later announced his support for teacher testing, a
concept that many congressional Republicans oppose, Coverdell
sought to smooth things over again. Coverdell assured his
colleagues that Bush was not in favor of federally imposed teacher
testing, but preferred leaving it up to the states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul has worked very hard to bring a strong coalition of
support for Governor Bush,'' says Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine).
``He's a good behind-the-scenes person. Because he's quiet about
it, I don't think people recognize what a tremendous role he
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's relationship with Bush dates to 1988 when both men
worked to help elect former President Bush, Bush's father. But
Coverdell's relationship with the Bush family dates to 1978, when
Coverdell first met the senior Bush when the latter was serving as
United Nations ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, then a Georgia state senator, became an early
supporter of Bush's bid to win the GOP presidential nomination in
1980, the year Ronald Reagan won and made Bush his running mate. In
1989, when Bush was president, he appointed Coverdell to head the
Peace Corps.
</P>
<P>
   The national exposure Coverdell received in that position helped
fuel his upset win over former Democratic Sen. Wyche Fowler in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell has maintained his close relationship with President
Bush. In fact, the guest cottage at Bush's family retreat in
Kennebunkport, Maine, is jokingly referred to as ``Coverdell
Cottage,'' says Karl Rove, Gov. Bush's top strategist in Austin,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul's a big-picture thinker,'' says Rove. ``He's a guy that
sees not the detail but the broader, bigger picture in which issues
fit. That's an unusual talent for someone. He's very soft-spoken
and very plain-spoken and absolutely dependable. I get this very
strong sense that his colleagues think if Paul says it, he means
it. And that's powerful.''

 &HT;    Dress to the nines to ring out '99
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _Carmen Marc Valvo's doctor father dreamed
that his son would become a plastic surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   But the young Valvo loved fashion. He sketched bellbottoms for
his sister's Barbies and later earned a degree in fine arts.
</P>
<P>
   He's designed under his own name for the last decade, and his
slinky, glittery evening wear has earned fans among the glitterati
that include Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Aniston and Salma Hayek.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, he's now doing the work of a plastic surgeon, but with
scissors instead of scalpels. ``To help a woman feel as beautiful
as she can, that's my biggest reward,'' Valvo says.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent visit to Boca Raton's Saks Fifth Avenue, the
46-year-old Valvo offered these designs for living it up on New
Year's Eve:
</P>
<P>
   _ If you've chosen a floor-length gown, wear it long.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a dress too short is a common mistake, Valvo says.
``Women say they want to dance, but if it clears your toe, you're
not going to walk on it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Tailor your accessories to your dress. And don't overdo it.
</P>
<P>
   With a microbeaded gown, all you need is ``a great, fabulous
earring,'' Valvo says. ``That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you're wearing a strapless black cashmere
gown, ``break out the family jewels.''
</P>
<P>
   _ To thine own self be true.
</P>
<P>
   Don't try to be Lauryn Hill if you more closely resemble Lauren
Bacall. Know if you are more Demi Moore or Mary Tyler Moore. Then
follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   One of Valvo's favorite celebrity clients is actress Julia
Ormond because ``she has a good sense of what suits her and what
doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Cover up.
</P>
<P>
   Valvo says he likes women to look like women, ``to dress as sexy
and bare and mysterious as she feels comfortable with.''
</P>
<P>
   But he designs jackets, boleros and stoles for all his gowns
because he feels it's more dramatic for a woman to make an entrance
covered up and then _ ta-da! _ reveal what's under her wrap.
</P>
<P>
   _ Go all out.
</P>
<P>
   On New Year's Eve, Valvo is playing host to family and friends
at his home in the Hamptons, and they'll all sit down for a
black-tie dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get as dressy as you possibly can, even if you're entertaining
at home,'' he says. ``Indulge. It's the last time this century that
you're going to be able to.''

   Car coaching can be a lesson in fear
</P>
<P>
   By Mark Lane
</P>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ The first instinct of parents is to
protect their young. So why do we teach them how to drive?
</P>
<P>
   The foolishness of doing this occurred to me as I watched a stop
sign get big very fast, right in front of me.
</P>
<P>
   I did not shout. Not out of self-control but because nothing
happened when I opened my mouth.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the sign, a truck, a dump truck weighed
down with gravel, roared past, flinging loose pebbles in its wake,
its engine whining under its burden. And we kept moving toward it,
my teen-aged daughter at the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   But she stopped abruptly, the car stalled out. When I opened my
eyes, I wasn't in heaven. I was in Brevard County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next time ... press the clutch ... or get out of gear ...
before hitting ... the brake ... and do it ... a little ... a
little ... sooner,'' I suggested. My words were came out in little
clumps as I concentrated on resuming a process of breathing in and
breathing out. Something that normally happens all by itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody drives manual shifts anymore,'' my daughter informed me
matter-of-factly and not at all like someone who might have
troubled my colleagues to write a very moving obituary on a
weekend. ``You are the only one who drives one who's not like
driving a truck or something.''
</P>
<P>
   She had a point. I learned how to drive in a manual-transmission
car. Like your first love, your first car shapes the rest of your
life. I learned to drive in a Volkswagen bug, the real old kind
that lacked the extras. Extras like a gas gauge.
</P>
<P>
   Because I started as a bug driver, I developed a few odd driving
habits. I step on the gas at the base of hills to build enough
momentum to get over the top. And I shift gears later than I really
should. I like to hear a bit of a whine before I flick the shift.
</P>
<P>
   These are not bad things. These are not dangerous things. They
just don't always make sense to automotive critics. Or
``passengers'' as they are sometimes called.
</P>
<P>
   I am a good driver but a poor judge of passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Mellow, nonjudgmental people get into my car and are transformed
into purists of the road. There is a worn spot on my passenger-side
car mat from their incessant pounding of imaginary brakes. I hate
it when they loudly promise, to no one I can see, that they will
live better lives if they reach their destination intact.
</P>
<P>
   They generally behave like wimps. It disgusts me when they start
whimpering and attempting to fling the door open before I've
stopped the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Enduring such insults at the hands of a carping, fault-finding
society, I resolved to do better by my kids and pass on the family
driving techniques. Not just the basics, but the skills that took
me a lifetime to perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Like how to steer with your knees while using both hands to open
the cellophane on a Little Debbie cake. How to know the difference
between the death-grind of worn brakes and the familiar
metal-on-metal sounds of deferrable maintenance. How to discern the
difference between a stop sign that means it and a stop sign that
is just for show.
</P>
<P>
   They don't teach you those things in drivers ed. They come from
hard-won experience.
</P>
<P>
   I had intended to transmit this rich storehouse of knowledge.
Now I'm not so sure. The first time out took a lot out of me.
</P>
<P>
   One tends to assume that a lot of driving is automatic, that
skills such as driving inside the white lines somehow are
instinctual.
</P>
<P>
   It takes only one outing with a student driver to understand
otherwise. This is not useful knowledge. It increases one's normal
fears of the road. You can drive with confidence only if you just
assume _ however falsely _ that cars naturally tend to stay on the
road. Finding out this is false is a tough lesson.
</P>
<P>
   I drove home at 25 mph.
</P>
<P>
   I am over it now and back to my old form. But Lesson Two cannot
be too far away and I dread what I will learn next. Still, I'm
going to keep with it. This will all be worth it when I'm at last
able to take my turn as a hypercritical, complaining passenger. I'm
already memorizing the ``Florida Driver's Handbook'' and practicing
my lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't look like you signaled 100 feet before that turn.''
</P>
<P>
   I can't wait.

 &HT;    Author claims stretches may help repetitive motion injuries
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Sue MacDonald was a skeptical reporter, so she
wasn't buying Richard H. Rossiter's claims until he put her through
20 minutes of stretches. It relieved 20 years of pain in her
telephone shoulder. ``You should write a book about this,'' she
told him.
</P>
<P>
   Rossiter wrote ``Overcoming Repetitive Motion Injuries the
Rossiter Way'' with MacDonald to give more people access to
Rossiter's pain-relieving techniques of manipulating connective
tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Where physicians typically treat a sore wrist, say, by focusing
on the wrist, Rossiter approaches the soreness as a symptom of a
broader problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of it as a chain,'' he says of the linkage among
tendons, ligaments and smaller connective tissues. Ideally, if a
person puts the thumb and forefinger of one hand on the bridge of
his nose and wiggles the fingers of his other hand, he'll feel some
movement up at the nose. ``It's a continuous strand all through the
body.''
</P>
<P>
   So fixing only the broken link in a chain won't solve the
problem, Rossiter says, without also loosening the kinks throughout
the chain that put stress on that link in the first place. ``If
everything's tight, then one of them has got to break. You've got
to loosen each link.''
</P>
<P>
   No extensive research has been done on the Rossiter System, but
the role of connective tissue in repetitive-motion injuries is well
understood by physical therapists and physiatrists, the burgeoning
and progressive specialty of physical and rehabilitative medicine.
``That's what is injured,'' says Dr. Dave Mitchell, a physiatrist
who is not familiar with Rossiter's program.
</P>
<P>
   Rossiter says the companies using his regimen have consistently
seen decreases in costs associated with repetitive-motion, or
repetitive-stress injuries (RMIs or RSIs). Workers' compensation
costs at Hollytex Carpet Mills in Anadarko, Okla., were $550
million for a company of 500 in 1993, the year it signed up
Rossiter. Those costs dropped steadily for three years before
leveling off at $65 million a year, according to the company. And
despite letting employees do 20 to 30 minutes of stretches two or
three times a week on company time, Hollytex reported no decline in
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration put RSIs in the spotlight this week
by announcing new workplace ergonomics regulations aimed at
reducing the 1.8 million such workplace injuries every year.
Although businesses are balking at the estimated $4.2 billion
annual cost, that is far less than the $13 billion in treatment
costs and $100 billion in lost productivity attributed to RSIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an epidemic of carpal tunnel syndrome,'' says
Mitchell, attributing it largely to computer keys that don't have
the give of typewriter keys. Golfer's or tennis elbow also has
become widespread, he says, ``and they all hurt like hell.''
</P>
<P>
   RSIs surface in necks, shoulders, arms, fingers, lower backs,
legs and elsewhere as a result of continually repeating any motion
from typing to cutting to lifting. Besides pain, they can cause
tingling and numbness.
</P>
<P>
   Rossiter's search for a better way to treat them began with his
quest to relieve his own chronic shoulder pain from his injury as
an Army helicopter pilot. Now 49, the Little Rock, Ark., resident
found the answer at the Rolf Institute of Structural Integration's
deep-tissue manipulation of connective tissue, became a certified
Rolfer himself and developed his simpler techniques with the help
of clients who were otherwise untreatable.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I've got a patient who's doing everything I tell them to
do and they're not getting better, I'm pretty sure the problem is
connective tissue,'' Mitchell says. ``It's hard to fix. That's why
the athletes say they'd rather break it than sprain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Patients should bear in mind that carpal tunnel syndrome
involves nerve damage that can require surgery, Mitchell says, and
Rossiter agrees that some people will need the stronger treatments
of drug injections or surgery. What Rossiter regrets is that so
many people try drugs or surgery first, damaging their connective
tissue to the point where ``we can only get you back maybe halfway,
if you're lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go with the least invasive way first,'' Rossiter says.
``If stretching all the tissue back out fixes the problem, that was
obviously the solution.''
</P>
<P>
   In 10 years of teaching the stretches, Rossiter has ``never had
a hint of a liability complaint,'' says MacDonald, who writes for
The Cincinnati Enquirer. The book and its photos describe six
stretches for the arm-to-neck axis and four for the lower back.
</P>
<P>
   To do the stretches, a patient needs a partner with a clean pair
of socks because the partner starts by applying a foot's width of
weight to a particular area of connective tissue. The foot's warmth
alone begins stretching the tissue, and the patient augments the
stretch by extending his or her limbs in a specified way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like Silly Putty,'' MacDonald says. ``When you
add warmth to it with your hand, it gets more supple and more
pliable and then you can stretch it out and loosen it up.''
</P>
<P>
   People often say the stretches themselves ``hurt good,'' she
says. ``You're very aware there's tension in the body, but you can
feel yourself stretching the pain away.'' Afterward, she says the
limb feels free and loose, not so heavy anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I think people just get used to living with pain,''
MacDonald says. ``I think people today are so stressed and tight
that sometimes they don't realize how you're supposed to feel.''

 &HT;    His idea keeps trees lighted
 &HT;    By Tim Tresslar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KETTERING, Ohio _ John Janning, the Ohio inventor who helped
make liquid-crystal display calculators and wrist watches possible,
knows his latest invention won't have the same world-changing
significance.
</P>
<P>
   But the way he sees it, his Stay Lit Christmas tree light system
will mean peace on Earth for Christmas tree owners and a
respectable financial return for him and his shareholders. That's
good enough for him.
</P>
<P>
   Janning, who bills himself as an ``inventor for hire,'' has
developed light strands that remain lit when one or more burn out,
fall out or come loose. The product goes to market for the first
time this year and is being sold through retailers such as Kmart,
Lowe's and Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Stay Lit will do is end frustration in the world,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Janning's interest in Christmas lights first sparked in the
mid-1990s when his wife repeatedly asked him to locate bad bulbs on
the holiday tree. After using the lengthy and frustrating process
of trial and error to locate them, the scientist decided to find a
better way.
</P>
<P>
   The solution: he developed a small tube that when slid over a
bulb would indicate whether it still worked. With the apparatus, he
could find a faulty bulb on a 50-light strand within 30 seconds
without pulling out a bulb, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Janning made 50 of the tubes and gave them to family as gifts.
He also offered the idea to decoration maker Noma. The two sides
never struck a deal, but executives told Janning that if he
developed a foolproof light strand, they wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   Janning took them up on the offer and developed one within two
weeks. He created a shunt _ two zener diodes on single chip inside
a plastic tube small enough to fit in the socket underneath the
bulb. When a bulb stops carrying current for any reason, the shunt
completes the circuit between the working bulbs so the strand
remains lit.
</P>
<P>
   Noma U.S. has licensed indoor/outdoor Stay lit light strings in
the U.S. while Alderbrook has Canadian licensing rights for the
50-light indoor string. Janning also is negotiating international
licensing rights through Stay Lit International, an organization he
owns with shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Uses for the Stay Lit product are expected to grow. Noma
executives want to include the lights not only on pre-lit trees,
which this year are sold only at Lowe's, but also on other Yuletide
decorations such as icicles, statuaries and wreaths.
</P>
<P>
   According to industry estimates, there are about 14 billion
Christmas light sockets in the U.S. Noma wants Stay Lit to account
for 10 percent of that market next year and then 20 percent after
that. To meet that demand next year, Noma will need one billion
chips, Janning said.
</P>
<P>
   If Janning's invention hits it big, it wouldn't be his first.
While employed at NCR Corp., Janning developed the molecular
alignment process that allowed for widespread use of liquid crystal
display technology. Janning retired from NCR in 1988 but continues
to do consulting for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Stay Lit bulbs go to market, Janning is working to make
his current invention obsolete. He has developed a new chip that
encases 10 diodes in a small rectangular box small enough to fit
underneath the Christmas bulbs. The new apparatus costs less to
produce and is more efficient than the shunt currently used in Stay
Lit bulbs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like socks on a rooster,'' he said. ``It's really, really
neat.''

 &HT;    More agents, immigrants travel dangerous terrain
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Many illegal immigrants are losing their lives
in the deserts and mountains and cactus scrub that dominate the
border. That was not part of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured that once we could contain the heavy entry points,
the downtown areas, ... that would be the deterrent,'' said de la
Vina, the Border Patrol chief. ``We never figured they would move
into the desert. (In San Diego) we weren't even patrolling those
areas.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, a freak snowstorm in the mountains east of San Diego
killed eight immigrants. Throughout the border, ranchers and agents
regularly find bodies, especially during droughts when watering
holes and livestock tanks that sustain illegal immigrants dry up.
No one knows how many bodies lie undiscovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, we're killing people,'' said Nathan Selzer of
Proyecto Libertad, an immigrant advocacy group in Harlingen. ``The
immigration service knows full well that these people are not going
to simply stop coming.''
</P>
<P>
   The actual body count is elusive. Mexico counted 357 last year.
The Border Patrol's 1998 total was 276, not including those on the
Mexican side. When University of Houston researchers recently
combed border death records, they found 1,600 suspected migrant
deaths from 1993 to 1997. They concluded that, overall, deaths have
not increased much; however, more people are dying from heat and
cold while fewer are killed by cars on San Diego's freeways or from
other causes.
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol, which has added rescue work to its duties,
blames the immigrant deaths on the coyotes, who are thriving as
more and more people search for a way around the blockades. The
coyotes routinely lead poorly prepared groups on days-long marches
through dangerous terrain or pack them into unventilated
semitrailers. The sick, the weak and the injured often are left to
fend for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In late July, Jesus Carrillo and two relatives floated across
the river on an inner tube and began walking through the mesquite
scrub, following the coyote they met in the restaurant next to the
Nuevo Laredo bus station. The man's price seemed reasonable _ $800
each to Dallas _ but that was before Carrillo saw the coyote slide
the hypodermic needle into the bruised crook of his arm. It was too
late by then.
</P>
<P>
   After five hours on the dirt path, the coyote stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Don't move; I'll be right back,''' Carrillo said.
The smuggler never returned. By the next afternoon, with the July
temperatures hovering at 105 degrees and their water down to a half
gallon, they somehow found their way to Interstate 35, emerging 50
yards from the Border Patrol checkpoint. They gladly surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants aren't the only people risking their lives on the
border. Agents face additional dangers as the new strategy forces
immigrants into more rugged terrain. Three agents, each with three
years' experience or less, have died in the mountains east of San
Diego after driving or falling off cliffs while pursuing suspected
illegal immigrants. San Diego Sector spokesman Roy Villareal said
footprints left by one of them ``indicate he was in full stride.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s have been the deadliest decade ever for Border Patrol
agents, surpassing even the 1920s, when agents routinely exchanged
fire with Prohibition-era bootleggers. Twelve of the 16 agents who
died on duty in the '20s were murdered.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen of this decade's 17 on-duty deaths have come since
January 1995, after the new strategy began. In addition to two
fatal falls, seven agents died in auto or aircraft accidents, three
suffered heart attacks, and four were shot to death _ including two
gunned down near Harlingen last year while backing up local
officers.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO'S `POBLACION FLOTANTE'
</P>
<P>
   In a small concrete building on the Mexican side of the bridge
connecting Laredo with Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, Octavio Reyes
Gonzalez waits for the Border Patrol buses and vans to deliver the
would-be immigrants who have been caught.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes, a Mexican immigration agent, ushers as many as 500 people
a day into his cramped office and asks them to fill out a
questionnaire _ little more than name, age and hometown _ before
they melt back into the streets. In Nuevo Laredo alone, 160,000
Mexicans were sent back over the bridge last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look tired, they have no money, and they're hungry,''
Reyes said. ``Some people say they're going back home; some say
they're going to try again. Some people are stuck over here because
they don't have any money to go back home. We call them the
`poblacion flotante.''' The floating population.
</P>
<P>
   They are the ones who worry Mexican border towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sleep in abandoned lots and houses. Then they finally end
up invading (private) land, and they set up their small huts,''
said Nuevo Laredo City Council Member Ernesto Ferrara Theriot.
``That's when the problem comes to the city government, because
after several months they come asking for water and city
services.''
</P>
<P>
   Nestor Rodriguez, a professor at the University of Houston
Center for Immigration Research, said other border cities are
facing the same problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not going to stop coming, so there's going to be a
pressure point somewhere, and it's happening in those Mexican
border towns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To relieve the pressure, Nuevo Laredo gives free bus tickets to
people who want to return home _ though Reyes said the tickets
don't come close to meeting the demand. Reynosa city spokesman
Francisco Garcia said his city plans to revive its $10,000-a-year
bus ticket program, because it's cheaper to send them home than to
provide ``all the things they need to live.''
</P>
<P>
   With no city homeless shelters in Reynosa, displaced migrants
turn to the few church-run shelters in town. At the Guadalupe
Catholic Church shelter, where dozens come every day to eat
church-cooked lunches, Father Oscar Guadalupe Lozano said the 19
beds are not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, there are 30 or 35 who stay here, who sleep in any
corner so they're not out in the street,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   PROTECTION OR OCCUPATION?
</P>
<P>
   Most U.S. border residents seem to support the new strategy.
Behind the counter at Zepeda Hardware in Brownsville, Mary Zepeda
said the agents have driven away the gangs of juveniles who used to
shoplift with impunity from downtown stores. Upriver in San Pedro,
Jesus Mesa said the people who used to pass his house ``like ants,
day and night'' no longer ask him for water or old shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Brownsville Police Chief Ben Reyna said the bandits who used to
lurk along the riverbank, robbing, raping and killing illegal
immigrants before fleeing into Mexico, have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even remember the last (bandit crime) we had,'' he
said. ``We're very, very pleased with what the Border Patrol is
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol may never be able to control the entire
border, but reducing traffic through border cities is a major
accomplishment, said Michael Fix, director of immigration studies
for the Urban Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole point is, this is kind of a shield for the border
cities,'' Fix said, ``and that in itself I think is justification
for doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cameron County Judge Gilbert Hinojosa is not pleased,
especially after a Border Patrol agent at the airport asked him to
declare his citizenship and wouldn't let him board the plane until
he did. His secretary, who lives near the river, has been stopped
several times so agents could search her vehicle for illegal
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really do make us feel like we're in occupied
territory,'' Hinojosa said. ``People here are loyal U.S. citizens
... and that they have to be submitted to this kind of harassment
so (Border Patrol) can stop illegal aliens from going to Chicago
and Denver and Detroit is just an insult.''
</P>
<P>
   Other critics question why the nation's leaders have focused so
much attention on the Mexico border while only about 300 agents
guard the 4,000-mile border with Canada, and millions of illegal
immigrants who have overstayed their visas are virtually ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a sort of insidious form of racism: We don't want
brown people,'' said Ouisa Davis, who works for Diocesan Migrant
and Refugee Services in El Paso. ``(Illegal immigrants) are easy
targets. These people have no political power.''
</P>
<P>
   INS officials estimate that as many as half of all illegal
immigrants did not sneak across the border but entered using
tourist, student or business visas and remained in the country
after their visas expired. INS officials say no one is actively
looking for them. Only about 8,500 so-called visa overstayers were
caught and deported in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   SHOULD BUILDUP CONTINUE?
</P>
<P>
   Whether Americans want to continue the border buildup is the
billion-dollar question.
</P>
<P>
   While polls consistently find that most Americans consider
illegal immigration a serious problem, immigration agents say the
public often winces at the reality of crackdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Eagle Pass rancher Dob Cunningham understands this
contradiction. He wants relief from the immigrants who march across
his property, leaving downed fences and empty water jugs in their
wake. But he can't help but admire them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of respect for those people,'' Cunningham said.
``They'll walk from Mexico to Dallas for a job, and people here
won't cross the street for one.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress set the wheels for the buildup in motion as the country
was pulling out of a recession, and supporters had a list of
reasons for controlling the border _ protecting American jobs from
cheap foreign labor; stopping drug traffickers; giving schools and
welfare agencies relief from dependent foreigners; protecting
border cities from crime.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the nation's economy humming and demand for workers
increasing, some immigration experts think support for the buildup
is fading in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Krikorian, the Center for Immigration Studies director, said the
anti-immigrant sentiment that rose from California's recession in
the early 1990s and the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center by
foreign terrorists ``created momentum to do something, but that
momentum has passed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol expansion is now the focus of a political
battle. The Clinton administration has declared its continued
support for the strategy but recently tried to slash money for new
agents from its 2000 budget, arguing that the Border Patrol needed
a ``breather'' to let new agents gain experience.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Congress pushed through money for another
1,000 new agents next year, although the agency was able to add
only 369 agents last year. The Border Patrol blamed attrition and a
tight labor market. Congress accused the agency and the
administration of dragging their heels.
</P>
<P>
   Krikorian said Americans need to understand that illegal
immigration isn't a problem to be solved ``but a permanent
phenomenon, like the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   He sees the changing of immigration routes as a sign of success.
But Antonio Zavaleta, a vice president at the University of Texas
at Brownsville, said America's booming economy will continue to
lure impoverished people, regardless of the obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Bob Santos doesn't see how anything will turn away the
people he chases every day, the thin young men and the wrinkled old
men and the women clutching infants, all of them poor and desperate
and repeating the illegal immigrants' mantra: I just want to work
to help my family.
</P>
<P>
   ``That stuff hits home,'' Santos said, driving down a
dust-choked trail next to the Rio Grande. ``You want to stop it?
You need to improve conditions in Mexico.''

 &HT;    Rising captures suggest migrants skirt blockades
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Five years and billions of dollars after
launching the most ambitious attack on illegal immigration in the
nation's history, the U.S. Border Patrol cannot show any sign that
the flow across the U.S.-Mexico border has slowed. In fact, it
appears to have increased despite the agency's aggressive new
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol has doubled in size since 1994 and completely
changed tactics: By concentrating agents and high-tech equipment to
blockade major border cities, the Border Patrol hoped to deter many
would-be crossers and force the rest into rural areas, where they
could not blend into city crowds to avoid capture.
</P>
<P>
   The agency insists the strategy works, pointing to dramatic
results at major crossing points as proof: Apprehensions of illegal
immigrants have hit a 24-year low near San Diego, and have dropped
by half in El Paso, Texas, since 1993. Many immigrants say crossing
the border is now more difficult and more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   But by applying the agency's own measuring stick _ the number of
apprehensions _ along the entire border, the strategy appears to be
failing: Agents apprehended more than 1.5 million people last year.
That's 300,000 more than in 1993 and just under the all-time record
of 1.6 million in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol cannot say how many people get past its
agents. But immigrants interviewed in Austin, in Mexico and on the
border say the blockades have had little impact on the overall flow
of people lured north by U.S. jobs that pay more in a day than most
Mexicans earn in a week.
</P>
<P>
   Illegal immigrants reacted to the blockades by going around
them. They have shifted their routes on a grand scale, flooding the
more lightly guarded areas such as Southeast Arizona, where
apprehensions have more than tripled since the new strategy began.
</P>
<P>
   The blockades also are undercut by a revolving door that sends
98 of every 100 people caught at the border back to Mexico with no
criminal charges. They avoid formal deportation; the Border Patrol
avoids overwhelming already swamped federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way we can put these people in detention facilities
when you're talking about 1.5 million (apprehensions) a year,''
said Border Patrol Chief Gus de la Vina.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that many illegal immigrants see the border
blockades more as an inconvenience than a deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Flores Roman, a 29-year-old Juarez construction worker
who says he's made ``countless'' illegal trips into the United
States to work, avoids the line of agents at El Paso by crossing
near lightly patrolled Fabens, 30 miles downriver.
</P>
<P>
   When agents caught him in July in a Fabens pecan orchard, Flores
was back in Mexico within two hours. ``When they take me back,'' he
said before hopping on a Border Patrol bus, ``I'm going to try
again.''
</P>
<P>
   De la Vina said the Border Patrol is confident that as it
expands the blockades in phases across the 2,000-mile border, the
pressure will wear down immigrants like Flores: ``We catch them, we
send them back. They make another attempt, and we catch them
again.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no deadline for completing the strategy, and the Border
Patrol cannot say how much money or how many agents it will
ultimately need. Outside estimates go as high as 20,000 agents _
roughly 2 1/2 times the current 8,351-member force, which has a
1999 budget of $864 million.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Border Patrol is having difficulty recruiting
enough agents to maintain its expansion. In Washington, the Clinton
administration has tried to slow the agency's growth. And the U.S.
General Accounting Office, which reviews the strategy annually, has
concluded that ``despite the investment of billions of dollars,''
the Immigration and Naturalization Service _ the Border Patrol's
parent agency _ ``did not know whether the investment was producing
the intended results.'' The total cost of the strategy since 1994
is approaching $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   If the strategy ultimately works _ and even Border Patrol agents
say that's a big if _ it would have major implications for Austin
and other U.S. cities that rely on illegal labor. In the meantime,
the strategy has had repercussions, some of them unintended, all
along the border:
</P>
<P>
   _ Since the buildup began, hundreds of immigrants have died from
extreme heat or cold after venturing into harsh terrain to avoid
the blockades. Several agents have died chasing them over the same
terrain.
</P>
<P>
   _ The blockades have given more business to smugglers. Coyotes,
as the smugglers of people are called, are raising their fees _ the
going rate from the border to Austin is $1,000 to $1,500 a person,
up from about $700 a few years ago _ and often leaving stragglers
behind to die during the journey.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mexican border cities say the buildup has flooded them with
penniless deportees who are straining city services, though many
U.S. border residents say it has reduced crime in their
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Some immigration experts see a gut-level conflict as a nation of
immigrants tries to figure out how to confront illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to see guys in Smokey the Bear hats on the
border, but nobody wants to see Jose across the street with his
nice family get deported, and that's why we can't get anywhere on
this problem,'' said Mark Krikorian, executive director of a
Washington-based think tank, Center for Immigration Studies, which
favors reduced immigration and the Border Patrol expansion.
</P>
<P>
   THE BORDER BLOCKADES
</P>
<P>
   Where the Rio Grande winds through Brownsville on its way to the
Gulf of Mexico, the forces gathered on the riverbank look prepared
to repel an invasion. Here, the United States has deployed hundreds
of agents equipped with advanced technology to keep out some of the
hemisphere's poorest people.
</P>
<P>
   As helicopters thump overhead, Border Patrol agents sit in
parked vehicles within sight of each other on the wide levee.
Insects swirl around stadium-style lights pointed at open fields.
Agents in air-conditioned boxes perched on hydraulic legs scan the
river's edges with night-vision cameras, which turn body heat into
ghostly green silhouettes. Sensors buried under well-worn dirt
paths wait for passing footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   Across the river, people sit in stands of brush and narrow
ravines, watching and waiting. Some plan to work and live in the
United States indefinitely. Others will spend most of each year
working north of the border and return home for the winter
holidays. A good number are border residents who lack the papers or
the inclination to use the international bridges and routinely
cross the river to visit friends and family, shop and work.
</P>
<P>
   To stop them, the Border Patrol's McAllen Sector, which includes
Brownsville, has grown from 501 to 1,166 agents in the past three
years. Agents are now stationed around the clock along the river
from the Gulf of Mexico to the Harlingen area.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we said is, as opposed to sitting back and waiting for
these individuals, let's get right up in their face,'' said Jaime
Salazar, a Brownsville Border Patrol supervisor. ``If they come to
the riverbank on the Mexican side and look into the U.S., they need
to see a big old friendly Border Patrol agent smiling at them.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar blockades are in place in El Paso, Laredo, San Diego and
Nogales, Ariz., and apprehensions dropped in each city after the
new strategy began, although they are up again in Nogales.
Meanwhile, apprehensions have increased dramatically in places such
as Eagle Pass, Douglas, Ariz., and the El Centro Sector in
southeast California _ where the total skyrocketed from 27,654 to
225,279 in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Are more or fewer people trying to cross since the blockades
began? Are agents catching a higher or lower percentage of those
who attempt to cross? The Border Patrol isn't sure because
apprehensions are an imperfect measure of success. They reflect
total arrests but not how many individuals are caught, and many
illegal immigrants are caught repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Border Patrol stations began using a new computer
system, called IDENT, which allows agents to take digital
photographs and fingerprints of illegal immigrants. Many immigrants
give agents false names and carry no identification.
</P>
<P>
   The $84.6 million system tells agents in the field how many
times someone has been caught. Each Border Patrol station appears
to have a different threshold for sending someone to federal court
for prosecution and formal deportation. In Laredo, it's the sixth
apprehension. In Eagle Pass, it's the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   When IDENT debuted, the INS hailed it as a tool to help track
migration patterns and repeat offenders. But so far, it has not
shed any light on whether the new border strategy is actually
deterring illegal immigrants. Agency officials have not yet
finished analyzing IDENT data to see if the number of repeat
offenders has changed.
</P>
<P>
   The new operations have raised tensions in some places. In
California, agents have been the targets of bullets, rocks and
Molotov cocktails. Last year near San Diego, agents shot at four
illegal immigrants in one week, killing two of them, after the
immigrants allegedly wielded rocks or tried to run down agents with
cars. The shootings were ruled justified.
</P>
<P>
   In Southeast Arizona, which has overtaken San Diego as the
nation's busiest crossing point, an estimated 600 Mexicans
simultaneously rushed agents in April, a sight one agent compared
to ``the beginning of a 10K run.'' Angry Arizona ranchers have
resorted to rounding up illegal immigrants at gunpoint, and
residents of that state have demanded that the governor call in the
National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   HOLES IN THE DIKE
</P>
<P>
   For most of the Border Patrol's 75-year existence, badly
outnumbered agents have tried to hold back generations of
bootleggers, drug smugglers, bandits and immigrants, with little
success. The INS estimates that more than 5 million illegal
immigrants now live in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   John Attanasio, a veteran agent now working at the Border Patrol
Academy in South Carolina, remembers the feeling of futility:
``When you're the only (agent), and a hundred people are running by
you, and you yell `Stop! Stop!' and they keep running by you on
both sides, you feel kind of stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   The old way of doing things required agents to roam in search of
people who had already crossed the border, chasing them through
downtown streets, pulling them over on highways, tracking them
through ranchland, and sometimes lying in wait for large groups
along remote footpaths.
</P>
<P>
   That began to change in 1993 when Sylvestre Reyes, the new chief
of the Border Patrol's El Paso Sector, looked at the mess he had
inherited: 250,000 illegal immigrants caught each year pouring over
the border; downtown merchants upset about loitering and
shoplifting; citizens complaining of being hassled for looking
Mexican. Reyes, now a congressman, concentrated 400 of the sector's
600 agents within sight of each other along a 20-mile stretch of
the river.
</P>
<P>
   The move created an uproar in Mexico, but Operation Hold the
Line made apprehensions plunge almost overnight. When they kept
dropping, from 285,000 to 79,000 in a year, Washington took notice,
and Reyes' experiment became the blueprint for a new era for the
Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   When the Border Patrol changed tactics, illegal immigrants did
what they have always done. They adapted, tapping into a grapevine
that reaches into even the smallest villages of Mexico and Central
America.
</P>
<P>
   Some already in the United States no longer make their annual
trip home, deciding to stay in the country for longer periods to
avoid the risk and expense of sneaking across the border. Other
immigrants pass through lightly guarded cities such as Eagle Pass
or try to wiggle through the blockades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had heard that it would be easy to cross here, so this is
where we came,'' said Joel Lopez Torrez, a 29-year-old Mexican
farmer who was caught near Eagle Pass as he tried to get to
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In Eagle Pass, which isn't yet using the blockades,
apprehensions have more than tripled since 1994. On a given shift,
the station might have as few as 20 agents trying to patrol 56
miles of twisting river. In July, they caught more than 4,300
illegal immigrants. Forty-eight people have died in the area this
year on both sides of the river, according to the Mexican
consulate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting overrun, but the guys are handling it,'' said
agent Esteban Ramirez, a 23-year veteran. ``You do what you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Even where the Border Patrol is strongest, people regularly slip
past them _ often to the amazement of agents.
</P>
<P>
   Smugglers have sent local youths across the river as decoys, and
one bought a used Federal Express truck to transport groups.
Immigrants have tied pieces of carpet to their feet to obscure
their tracks. El Paso agents have found flashlights stashed in
storm drains _ clues that the immigrants were passing underneath
them. Agents recently discovered a network of 50 to 60 hand-dug
tunnels under the city.
</P>
<P>
   Near Laredo, Border Patrol supervisor Jose ``Joe Bob'' Gonzales
ducked into a maze of passages the immigrants had burrowed into the
thick apron of cane at the river's edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as (an illegal immigrant) sees you, he hits that path
and he keeps going and going, then he turns north and ffft, he's
gone,'' Gonzales said. ``You know, you could put a guy every
quarter-mile here, and they'd still find a way to get in.''
</P>
<P>
   They are desperate. Although Mexico's economy is rebounding
since a devastating 1994 peso devaluation, unemployment and low pay
are still chronic problems. Poverty, combined with recent natural
disasters _ an ongoing drought in the north, floods in the south _
continue driving people over the border.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Angel Amaro Morales, 29, said he could not support his wife
and three children on the $40 a week he earned working construction
in Monterrey. When agents caught him in Laredo this summer _ for
the third time this year _ he said he and his companions planned to
cross again to resume their march to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   They cannot go home now, he said. ``There's no work.''
</P>
<P>
   EFFECTS OF BUILDUP
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol buildup has had repercussions, some of them
unintended, along the 2,000-mile boundary:
</P>
<P>
   _ Hundreds of immigrants have died from extreme heat or cold
venturing into harsh terrain to avoid the blockades, and several
agents have died while pursuing them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Business is booming for people smugglers who lead immigrants
around the blockades. Trips to Austin can cost $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mexican border cities say they are besieged by destitute
deportees who become squatters, overwhelming local services. Many
U.S. border residents say the blockades have brought relief from
crime.

 &HT;    Teens try to nix smoking trend, want more direct warning labels
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Langston Burgess thrusts Tic Tacs upon youngsters
who smoke. ``I hate the smell,'' he says. He wears T-shirts and
pins with anti-smoking messages. He tries to alarm the kids who do
smoke and inform the ones who don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to make it a trend,'' said the 15-year-old Dunbar
sophomore, but it's an uphill battle. More than one-third of white
American teen-agers smoke, and while the rate for blacks is lower,
it has nearly doubled in the past two years to 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten a few people to quit,'' Langston said. It's hard
to reach young smokers, though. Sometimes, he said, ``We're like up
a creek without a paddle. It feels like there's nothing we can
really do. We're just trying to get the word out, trying to get the
percentages lower.''
</P>
<P>
   Burgess and others in the Teen Waves Wellness Coalition want to
hear more ideas about knocking down those percentages from 9:30
a.m. to noon Saturday at the Teen Tobacco Summit. The strategy
they've focused on is more effective warning labels on cigarette
packs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're basically meaningless,'' said Larry Black, a
13-year-old eighth-grader at Fairview Middle School.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't pay attention to them,'' said Brian Selman,
Black's classmate.
</P>
<P>
   The subject came up last spring when Dr. David Satcher, the U.S.
surgeon general, came to town to speak at the commencement for the
Wright State University School of Medicine, which sponsors the teen
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do cigarette packs have warning labels that many people
don't understand?'' Burgess asked him. Some labels raise the
specters of carbon monoxide and emphysema, for example, but most of
his friends don't know enough about either one to be afraid of
them. If teen-agers understood these dangers, he said, maybe they
wouldn't smoke.
</P>

   ``Some of the labels need to be improved and made clearer,''
Satcher told Langston, Larry and Brian in June. He said they should
think of some ideas and send them to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it should say in very big letters: 'Smoke kills,'''
Langston said last week. ``'Hey, you! You smoke, you die.' We want
warning labels to be more blunt. We don't want people to think of
cigarettes like a friend.''

   The coalition is concentrating especially on keeping nonsmokers
from starting, if only because that's more practical than trying to
talk nicotine addicts out of smoking. Mychal Edwards, a 16-year-old
member, thinks the best way is to make the consequences of smoking
more vividly clear.
</P>
<P>
   Let kids see an elderly smoker fighting for breath on his
respirator, Mychal said. Show them the fantastic high school
basketball player in his gym class whose only weakness is he can't
run up and down the court without going into coughing jags. Let
them hear from the smoker he waited on at McDonald's, whose voice
sounded more like croaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just one reason I wouldn't mess with smoking,'' Mychal
said. ``You could lose your voice. You could lose everything. Your
whole body gets messed up. We need to show people how smoking hurts
you. We need to say, `You could actually end up like this.'''

   ALASKA-CRUISESHIPS (Juneau, Alaska) _ The cruise ship industry,
once embraced as a savior for a lagging state economy, has worn out
its welcome here. Fed up with giant ships that discharge waste in
their pristine waterways and tourists who flood their downtown,
residents of Alaska's capital approved a $5 tax on every passenger
last month. The small town of Haines voted to limit the number of
cruise ships allowed at its dock. And several people have suggested
publicly that one cruise line be barred from the state's waters.
But in fighting to restrict the $12 billion cruise ship industry,

   COSMIC-EMPTINESS (Undated) _ Like the sorcerer's apprentice, who
could not banish the spirits that his spells had conjured up,
astronomers around the world have been trying -- with increasing
desperation -- to disprove the astonishing discovery, announced
early last year, that distant galaxies are being swept apart from
one another by a tide formed of apparently empty space. But almost
two years of effort to do so have yielded observational data that
only support the conclusion. Just last month, a subtle but
initially promising objection by one group of astronomers was shot
down by a new analysis of that data. The result, scientists are
reluctantly concluding, is that something in the theory of
elementary particle physics is terribly wrong. To explain the
observations, scientists say, they must answer a question that
sounds paradoxical: How much does emptiness weigh? By James Glanz.
</P>
<P>
   EARLY-SCHIZOPHRENIA (Undated) _ By the time most psychiatrists
encounter schizophrenia, the illness is already in full flower. But
scientists have long surmised that it starts much earlier, the
demons beginning to nibble at the edges of young people's lives
well before the most flagrant symptoms of psychosis appear. If
those at highest risk could only be identified early, mental health
researchers have believed, it might someday be possible to prevent
the disorder, or at least to mitigate its most devastating effects.
And researchers are now beginning, in a systematic way, to
investigate the earliest stages of schizophrenia, attempting to
find signs that could predict its onset. By Erica Goode.

`INVISIBLE UNIVERSE' COLORS RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT PERCEPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
REVIEW OF: ``The Invisible Universe'' 
 By David Malin (Bullfinch, $50 until Dec. 31, $60 after)  
 
 
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Invisible Universe'' is a beautiful book of astronomical
photographs. It is the size, if not of a coffee table, at least of
a good-size end table. Inside are some of the most ravishing
pictures of the heavens that you will ever see.
</P>
<P>
   The book concentrates on deep-sky objects and nebulae, one photo
to a page, with text on the facing page explaining what we are
looking at.
</P>
<P>
   There are rosy rings of hydrogen gas, blasting inconceivable
distances from a former supernova; there are sooty bags of black
dust blocking out bits of background glow; there are swirling
spiral galaxies twisting their way through the emptiness.
</P>
<P>
   All of it in a color as intense as an ``Arizona Highways''
magazine sunset. You cannot even browse through this book and not
come away with the feeling that the universe is heartbreakingly
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it raises some interesting issues concerning our
assumptions about our own perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Questions have been raised recently, in such places as
``Discover'' magazine, about the accuracy of the space photos we
love to gawk at. Many of the National Aeronautic and Space
Administration pictures of the solar system _ and even the recently
celebrated ``Pillars of Creation'' photo of the Eagle Nebula in the
constellation Serpens _ are printed in an exaggerated false color.
</P>
<P>
   The colors are used diagrammatically. Imagine your high-school
class photo, for instance, in which all the students taller than 6
feet are colored blue, and all those under 5 feet are colored red,
with those in between colored yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Such a picture would not be an accurate representation of the
way the scene looked, but it would provide useful information to
someone who needed that information.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the NASA photos are coded that way with the colors to
aid the scientists using them. It makes visible what is invisible
on a planet's surface _ like the winds of Venus.
</P>
<P>
   Such color is useful to astronomers interested in studying the
internal structure of the nebula, but creates a false impression of
what the phenomenon might look like to the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   Author David Malin, who took the photographs in ``The Invisible
Universe,'' is touchy on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``The color photographs reproduced here are the colors of
nature, too faint to be seen and too diluted to be captured on
color film, but real nonetheless,'' he writes in a technical note
concerning the difficulty of arriving at ``true'' color in
astronomical photography.
</P>
<P>
   But his claim begs the question: If the colors of nature are too
faint to be seen, how can he claim that they are the ``true
colors''? Are they the colors we would see if they weren't too
faint? But they ARE``'' faint. Then, what makes them real?
</P>
<P>
   I must assume that he means that they are the colors we would
see if the Earth were very close to them instead of very far away,
so that they would be brighter and we could actually see the
colors. But because they are far away, Malin is essentially
synthesizing what color he believes they would appear to be if we
could somehow UPS the solar system next door to the nebula.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that color vision, as it has developed in human
beings, is not quite what we all think it is. Color vision is a
complicated evolutionary development, and it evolved in a specific
ecological niche for a specific purpose.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to get too technical here, but when a scientist
talks about color, he is usually talking about the spectrum. That
is, to him, light is a wavelength on the electromagnetic spectrum.
A small portion of that full electromagnetic spectrum is visible to
humans as light. Red is at the longer-wavelength end and blue at
the shorter-wavelength end.
</P>
<P>
   But human vision doesn't react exactly to the discrete
wavelengths, but is in fact generated from three fuzzy points on
that spectrum and rebuilt in the brain to simulate the full
spectrum. Human vision is a miracle of generalizing from the
fragment to the whole.
</P>
<P>
   And therefore, it is, in itself a version of ``false color.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Malin makes a leap of faith between the spectral colors he
captures on film and the regenerated synthesis of color inside the
brain and assumes they are equal.
</P>
<P>
   Red-violet, for instance (or more technically, magenta) does not
even exist as a wavelength. Yet we see it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Further, our eyes are only dimly sensitive to color. We see
black and white a great deal more acutely than we see color. And in
dim light, the black and white kicks in and the color tends to drop
out.
</P>
<P>
   That means that such incredibly dim deep-sky objects as nebulae
are seen by the human eye in the monochrome of low-light vision.
Nebulae have no color at all (or more precisely, we see them in a
blue-green monochrome, because that is how our brains are wired).
</P>
<P>
   So, the long time-exposure photographs make ``visible'' what is
invisible.
</P>
<P>
   All of which make Malin's claim of true color not a lie, but too
simple.
</P>
<P>
   There are many other problems, too. Film, even the black and
white film that Malin used to construct his color pictures, suffers
from something called reciprocity failure. That is, the sensitivity
of the film is distorted during long exposures and when taking
three photographs through three different color filters to
synthesize the color, the exposures must differ to accommodate the
filters and the reciprocity failure. This makes the result always
somewhat iffy.
</P>
<P>
   I raise all these issues not to denigrate Malin's book, which I
love, but to remind us once again that even such a simple
proposition as what the world _ and the universe _ ``look like'' is
not as settled as we think.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us live our lives with the maxim, ``seeing is
believing,'' and we tend to be smug about the accuracy of our sense
data. Scientists can measure spectral color, but the color we see
is something different. It is purely subjective.
</P>
<P>
   And as with relativity and quantum mechanics, we don't notice
the discrepancies at the scale of our day-to-day lives, but when we
reach the very large and the very small, the assumptions of our
perceptions break down. And, if we have any sense, we shrivel in
humility. &QL;

   This book offers lots of pretty photographs of the Mojave Desert
in which Dykinga seems to concede (appearances on the cover
notwithstanding) that not everything in the rural Southwest is
fluorescent orange. The big draw for us, however, is Janice Emily
Bowers, who lives near Tucson and who has written lovely essays
(``A Full Life in a Small Place'') about the natural wonders there.
Both writer and photographer were assisted by the rains &QL; 
of El Nino during the winter of 1997-1998, which brought the desert
into abundant bloom and made their jobs even more pleasurable than
they'd expected them to be. Tourists came from far away to see the
flowers that spring, many for the first time. Bowers envied them.
``The first time of seeing the desert in bloom is almost painful in
its intensity,'' she writes, ``as if every flower were a needle
piercing your skin or a chunk of ice pressed onto your flesh. I
wanted to join that spring, as if it were a circus, and travel with
it forever.'' She acknowledges that this book might attract more
tourists, which increases her concern over the beautiful,
vulnerable desert. Are the crowds good or bad? ``Sometimes,'' she
writes, ``I don't know which group worries me most: the millions
who visit or the millions who stay away.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``ATLANTIS FOUND'' &QL; 
By Clive Cussler (Putnam, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is what Clive Cussler says about his appeal as a writer:
``I give people what they want. My books are like an old Saturday
afternoon matinee with easily identifiable characters: the big
rugged hero; the shrewd heroine (who is never a bimbo); the nasty
villain who gets it in the end . . . I never mean for it to be
anything more than entertainment.'' His sprawling novel features
his recurring big rugged hero, Dirk Pitt, who is supremely capable
and ever manly but a bit on the stiff side (he's like James Bond
without the panache). His shrewd heroine who isn't a bimbo is Pat
O'Connell, an expert in ancient languages. And the villains? There
are so many, and they fall all over themselves trying to kill
O'Connell and her colleagues and then Pitt, who makes a Bond-like
entrance and rescues them from drowning in flooded tunnels under a
mountain in Colorado. One of the assassins shows up in a ninja suit
and a ski mask, and even though he has a chest wound and is
bleeding from the mouth, he calmly discusses his motives with Pitt
before swallowing a cyanide capsule _ a Saturday matinee touch if
we've ever seen one. The plot here is impossible to describe
because it's more a collection of parts than a cohesive whole.
Among the elements: a comet that crashed into the Earth 9,000 years
ago; a frozen ghost ship discovered near the South Pole in 1858; an
underground chamber with inscriptions on its walls and a black
skull on a pedestal; a Nazi U-boat that attacks Pitt's research
vessel; and a cameo appearance by Cussler himself (a Hitchcockian
tradition that he has added to his novels). We'll let you guess who
triumphs before the final credits roll.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
``WITH WILDER'' &QL; 
By Cameron Crowe (Knopf, $35) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is a wonderful book, not just for film buffs but for those
of us who believe in preserving the stories of people who have had
long and eventful lives. That's an understated description of
director Billy Wilder, of course, but it's the spirit in which this
volume was written. In 1995, Crowe, who had adapted his book ``Fast
Times at Ridgemont High'' for film and had written and directed
``Say Anything,'' approached Wilder and asked the 89-year-old
director to play a bit part in his next movie, ``Jerry Maguire.''
Wilder said no, even when Crowe came back with Tom Cruise, who
turned on the high beams and begged. Crowe wrote about Wilder's
rebuff for ``Rolling Stone.'' Wilder read and liked the story, and
he agreed to an interview with Crowe, a project that expanded to
become this book. In question-and-answer format, Wilder talks about
working with actors (Jack Lemmon, Gary Cooper, Audrey Hepburn,
Marilyn Monroe, Cary Grant, Barbara Stanwyck, Greta Garbo), his
films (``Some Like It Hot,'' ``The Apartment,'' ``Ace in the
Hole,'' ``Sunset Boulevard''), other directors and his big
inspiration, Ernst Lubitsch. There are anecdotes on every page, and
no pretense in sight. The interviews, conducted by Crowe with the
persistence of a journalist and the giddy curiosity of a fan, took
place over more than a year, ending in 1998, when Wilder was 91. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``A PASSION FOR BOOKS'' &QL; 
Edited by Harold Rabinowitz and Rob Kaplan (Times, $27.50) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an essay written in 1981, Anatole Broyard laments the fact
that his friends borrow his books because he has more than most
people, never mind that ``I feel about lending a book the way most
fathers feel about their daughters living with a man out of
wedlock.'' Robertson Davies writes about the idiosyncrasies of book
collecting. Anna Quindlen offers a list of ``The Ten Books One
Would Save in a Fire, If One Could Save Only Ten.'' John Updike
bemoans the gray fluff of book envelopes. Robert Benchley wonders
why no one collects his books (this was in 1934 _ things have
changed). Norman Mailer names his favorite American novels: not one
of them was written by him. This collection is for people who know
what Peter Hamill was talking about when he said this: ``There are
10,000 books in my library, and it will keep growing until I die.
This has exasperated my daughters, amused my friends, and baffled
my accountant. If I had not picked up this habit in the library
long ago, I would have more money in the bank today. I would not be
richer.'' &QL;

PROTESTERS COULD STEAL THE SHOW AT SEATTLE TRADE TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ There will be hundreds of protesters in sea-turtle
costumes and stilt walkers dressed as monarch butterflies.
Thousands of people will tie up the downtown during a giant
demonstration, and protesters will chain themselves to buildings or
scale walls to unfurl banners denouncing the target of their ire:
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   In what is shaping up as one of the biggest protest efforts in
years, people from more than 500 organizations have poured into
Seattle. They accuse the 134-nation, Geneva-based world trade body,
which is holding its ministerial meeting here this week, of
favoring free trade at the expense of the environment, consumer
safety and workers' rights.
</P>
<P>
   The protest groups range from the well-known, like Friends of
the Earth and the Humane Society, to the obscure, like the Ruckus
Society and Raging Grannies.
</P>
<P>
   Several, including the Sierra Club and the United Steelworkers
of America, are planning a Seattle Tea Party on Monday with the
slogan ``No Globalization Without Representation.'' Imitating their
Boston forebears, the protesters plan to throw steel imported from
China into the sea as well as some shrimp, hormone-treated beef and
other goods they view as tainted by the trade body's decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The WTO responds to the needs and interests of the very rich
and corporations, but it doesn't respond to the needs of the
environment, labor, the poor, women or indigenous people,'' said
Alli Starr, a dancer in the radical group, Art and Revolution, who
flew in from San Francisco to protest and do street theater.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing a page from Vietnam War protests, the trade
organization's critics have scheduled a weeklong cavalcade of
activities, including teach-ins, concerts, people's tribunals for
corporations and appearances by sympathetic members of Congress.
Like the 1968 Democratic Party convention in Chicago, the trade
meeting has become a magnet for all manner of protest.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, hundreds of protesters plan to form a human
chain around Seattle's exhibition center to demand that wealthy
nations cancel the debt owed by the world's poor nations. The
biggest event will be a protest march on Tuesday sponsored by the
AFL-CIO, which wants the trade body to allow trade sanctions
against countries that violate core labor standards, like
prohibitions against child labor.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the groups hope to pressure the trade body to change its
ways, while others want to disrupt it, with the ultimate goal of
destroying it. In 1919, Seattle endured one of the nation's first
general strikes, but it has never experienced protests with people
from so many different groups _ labor unions, farm groups,
environmental groups _ and so many countries, including Canada,
France, Panama and India.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, trade ministers' meetings attracted only a
handful of protesters, who were largely seen as cranks, but the
protests have mushroomed and include many mainstream groups. The
protests have been fueled by the Internet, anxiety about
globalization and anger with World Trade Organization rulings.
</P>
<P>
   In the most-criticized ruling, the United States was found to
have acted illegally in barring imported shrimp caught by fishing
fleets whose nets do not contain devices allowing sea turtles to
escape. The protesters also oppose a ruling that an American
requirement for a smog-fighting gasoline additive was an unfair
trade barrier, and another that concluded that Europe had no
scientific basis for barring hormone-treated beef from the United
States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people are upset with the WTO because of the
expansiveness of its limits on government health and safety
actions,'' said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen's Global
Trade Watch, a Ralph Nader group. With 20 organizers here, that has
been the main coordinator of the protests. ``The WTO has managed to
gore everyone's ox. Its track record has been that every single
environmental or health policy it has reviewed has been found to be
an illegal trade barrier.''
</P>
<P>
   The ministers gathered here plan intense, closed-doors talks to
decide what specific areas of trade should be included in a
multiyear round of negotiations aimed at reducing trade barriers.
In contrast, many protesters hope to make their protests as visible
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the meeting has become Ground Zero for anyone with
a beef about the world economy. There are protesters against the
growing gap between rich and poor, against genetically engineered
products, against despoiling rain forests and against America's
economic and political dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be using a carnival festival model to oppose the
WTO,'' said Brooke Lehman, a New York-based protester active in a
group called No to WTO. ``Everybody is coming together to protest
the WTO and the corporate-dictated government it represents. We
regard the WTO as an undemocratic, illegitimate power.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixty groups in a coalition called the Turning Point Project are
spending more than $100,000 on full-page advertisements attacking
the trade body, saying that expanded agricultural trade is hurting
small farmers in dozens of countries and causing more pollution and
energy use.
</P>
<P>
   The Geneva-based trade body's defenders say globalization and
expanded trade are vital for making poor countries wealthier, and
some proponents suggest that many protesters want to stop economic
progress altogether. They also say it aims to promote free trade by
overturning various countries' laws or regulations that
discriminate against trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   With so many protesters crowding into Seattle, police officials
here say they fear some violence. But many protest leaders say they
fear that violence would detract from their message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm scared that if one anarchist throws a brick through a
store window downtown, that will become the big story, and our
whole critique of the WTO is going to get lost,'' said Michael
Dolan, Public Citizen's main coordinator of the protests.

`WARTS AND ALL,' THESE HILLBILLIES ARE PROUD OF IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're searching for a television heroine, look no further
than Iree Bowling.
</P>
<P>
   She has lived all but five months of her 68 years in dirt-poor
Mudlick Hollow, a valley in eastern Kentucky. But her presence _ to
say nothing of her pride _ rivets you to the screen in ``American
Hollow,'' the excellent HBO documentary produced and directed by
Rory Kennedy, in a way whippet-thin Hollywood actresses only wish
they could manage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had hard times and we've had good times and we've had
sad times,'' Iree says in the film as she prepares to kill a couple
of chickens for dinner. ``It ain't been easy, but we survived.''
</P>
<P>
   ``American Hollow'' follows the Bowling family for a year, a
year in which one family member will be arrested, one will be
dumped at the altar and one will divorce a husband who not only
routinely beat her but bragged about it.
</P>
<P>
   It's an invaluable look at a way of life unknown _
incomprehensible even _ to most Americans who when they hear the
word hillbilly conjure up images of Jed Clampett and Jethro Bodine.
The Bowlings are the genuine item, and they're not ashamed of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillbillies everyone thinks is stupid and ornery and no
good,'' Iree's son Lanzlo says. ``We are hillbillies and proud to
be hillbillies.''
</P>
<P>
   Real jobs are scarce, and every member of the family receives
some form of government assistance. But they also work, gathering
moss and roots to sell or doing odd jobs to supplement their
income.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been easy to make it around here,'' Neil, one of
Iree's sons, says as he scours the ground for bloodroot. ``I've
always thought it was if you weren't too sorry to get out and do
somethin'.''
</P>
<P>
   Iree wouldn't even slow down for the filmmakers. Kennedy talked
about her first time meeting the Bowlings' matriarch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was Iree putting out her laundry and making quilts and
out in the garden,'' Kennedy said from New York last week. ``She
was doing all the things that are really her life. She did them
while we were there. There was not a lot of sitting around talking
to us. If we were going to hang out, we were going to work with her
on her terms. It was pretty clear that she was a special person.''
</P>
<P>
   So many people talk about family values _ talk about them by
e-mail with their far-flung relatives, that is, when they're not
too busy slurping cafe latte in the latest trendy overgrown coffee
shop while their children endure forced ``play dates'' between FAO
Schwarz shopping sprees.
</P>
<P>
   The Bowlings ARE family values, with all the good and bad that
implies. Only one of Iree's 13 children has left the hollow. Others
have tried, but somehow always drift back. HOME and FAMILY aren't
just buzzwords to the Bowlings _ they are their only means of
survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the things that was striking about the family
was this family does live in poverty, and they face innumerable
challenges,'' Kennedy said. ``There's something about the Bowlings
where you can see this indomitable spirit that enables them to
overcome these difficulties. I think the film is not just a
portrait of need and want and poverty. It's also a celebration of
that spirit that we can all identify with on some level.''
</P>
<P>
   It is. But it's rarely a pretty picture. Clint, 17, argues,
often profanely, with his parents. Clint's fiancee talks about how
most of her friends are married by the seventh grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some girls have babies when they're 12 years old,'' she says
matter-of-factly. ``I do think that's kind of young to have a baby,
because you're still a baby when you're 12 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   When Edgar Bowling is arrested on a breaking and entering
charge, the family tries to pool together $5,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dirt's dirt,'' Edgar's brother, Neil, says as he prepares to
put up his property deed for bail. ``Your brother's your blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Iree, meanwhile, counts out $500 cash, explaining that she had
hoped to use the money to fix up part of her house and buy a VCR.
There is no trace of self-pity in her voice as she unfolds the
bills. She's simply doing what she can for her son.
</P>
<P>
   It's not enough _ nothing the Bowlings can scrape together is
worth $5,000, so Edgar waits in jail 17 days until the charges are
dropped due to a case of mistaken identity.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's camera is everywhere _ with Iree's daughter Samantha
as she returns to look at the home where her husband beat her, at
the annual Labor Day family picnic, in Lanzlo's kitchen as he
worriedly awaits his monthly shipment of Prozac. ``Right now I'd
kill to get it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   When Clint's fiancee breaks up with him, we're in the bedroom
with him, on the phone; her voice is heard as well. And when he
bolts the house, the camera follows, so that we see him shrieking
as he punches a hole in a wooden shed, the pain in his hand no
match for the pain in his heart.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the camera never intrudes. The Bowlings never seem to be
acting and often seem to forget they're being filmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really didn't have any reason to play to the camera,''
Kennedy said. ``They are who they are and they're proud of who they
are and are ready to embrace their life, warts and all.''
</P>
<P>
   Clint wants to leave Mudlick Hollow, and you ache for him to do
so. He yearns for more, and it doesn't take a social scientist to
figure out that if he stays, he won't find it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``American Hollow'' also shines a light on some of the
happiness and pride inside the falling-down shacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I been fortunate to raise 13 children and live here and teach
them how to work and what to do,'' Iree says _ and you feel like
hugging her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm doing a good job.'' &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brisk winds from the northwest will import noticeably colder air
into the Great Lakes and interior Northeast on Monday. Snow showers
will accompany a jet stream disturbance as it sweeps southeast
through the region, whitening the landscape from northern Ohio to
the New England mountains. As the chilly air is heated and
moistened upon crossing the Great Lakes, locally heavier snow
showers will form downwind of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. Up to a
half foot of snow is possible in a few spots in northeast Ohio and
northwestern Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest winds descending the Appalachian Mountains on Monday
will suppress clouds near the Northeast Seaboard. Amid abundant
sunshine, daytime readings will reach into the 40s in the afternoon
from Washington, D.C., to Boston. Much colder air will reach the
Northeast and Middle Atlantic coasts on Monday night and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Windswept rain will lash portions of the West Coast Monday as a
plume of Pacific moisture arrives ahead of an approaching cold
front. Rain will occur from north of Los Angeles to the Northwest
Coast. The rain will turn heavy for a time over northern California
as a jet stream disturbance passes overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Dry weather and ample sunshine will cover an expansive area from
southern California to lower Mississippi Valley as high pressure
near 20,000 feet remains across the region. Very strong winds from
the west will buffet the northern Rockies with gusts locally
exceeding 60 mph from the Front Range of Montana to eastern
Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Damp Days
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since September 28, not a drop of rain fell
in Juneau, Alaska, on Saturday. The streak of 59 days with at least
a trace of rain fell short of the record of 68 damp days set in
1977. While the recent wetness has been notable, Juneau, which is
in the path of many storms that cross the Gulf of Alaska, typically
has rain on about 70 percent of the days at this time of year.
Persistent clouds during this wet spell have contributed to
unusually mild nights. Indeed, Saturday brought the first reading
below 28 degrees to Juneau this season, setting a new mark for the
latest hard freeze on record.

BASQUE SEPARATISTS END CEASE-FIRE, WARN OF VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID _ The Basque separatist group ETA announced Sunday that
it would end a 14-month cease-fire. The rebels warned that armed
attacks could resume as early as Friday in their long struggle for
an independent homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The cease-fire has been the longest period of calm in three
decades of separatist violence and had initially raised hopes that
both sides would use it as an opportunity to work out a lasting
peace for a conflict that authorities say has killed about 800
people.
</P>
<P>
   The failure to do so, said the rebel's statement, published
Sunday in the Basque newspaper Gara, lay with the governments of
Spain and France and also with moderate Basque nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish government disagreed. In response to the ETA
announcement, Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar accused the rebels of
intransigence and said that they were solely responsible for
breaking the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``ETA is wrong again if it thinks that with coercion, blackmail
or terror it will cause a breakdown in democracy and freedom,''
Aznar said in a six-minute statement that was nationally televised.
``ETA is wrong to think it can turn citizens into hostages and put
a price on peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The peace effort, which began on Sept. 16, 1998, when the rebels
announced an indefinite cease-fire, has been stalled for months.
There was only one round of talks between the government and the
rebels, on May 19 in Switzerland. In August the rebels said they
would not attend a second meeting, accusing the government of
seeking political gain from the truce.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process is blocked and poisoned,'' ETA's statement said
Sunday. ``Responding to a pledge to defend the Basque country, the
decision has been taken to reactivate the use of armed struggle.
From December 3, it is up to ETA to inform its operational
commandos when to take action.''
</P>
<P>
   ETA, whose initials stand for the Basque words for Basque
Homeland and Liberty, has insisted on self-determination for 2.6
million people who live in Spain's four historic Basque provinces
and 250,000 others in the French part of the Basque region.
</P>
<P>
   But the government has said it was only willing to discuss
possible leniency for hundreds of Basque prisoners and exiles.
Madrid has also called for the rebels to permanently renounce
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has done, is doing and will do all it can to
achieve a lasting peace,'' Aznar said Sunday. National elections
are due to be held by April, and the peace process is likely to be
a backdrop to his campaign for a second term.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The rebels' peace overture last year followed in the steps of
the Irish Republican Army, but while the peace process in Northern
Ireland has lurched forward, the effort here has deteriorated to
its lowest ebb.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish political leaders of all stripes expressed deep
disappointment Sunday at the end of the cease-fire, but they urged
Spaniards not to lose hope for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Six million people marched in the streets in July 1997 to demand
peace after the rebels kidnapped and killed a Basque town
councilman, Miguel Angel Blanco.
</P>
<P>
   That outpouring of public sentiment was seen as a turning point
in the fight against terrorism, along with the increasingly
efficient police crackdown against the rebels in Spain and in their
rear guard hideouts in France.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel supporters complained that even after the cease-fire took
effect, the police continued to arrest top ETA leaders, including
the detention last month of Belen Gonzalez Penalva, whom
authorities say represented the rebels at the peace talks last May.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the police said that they have detected rebel attempts
to prepare for new attacks, including the brazen theft of
industrial dynamite in France in September, although authorities
recovered some of the explosives soon after.
</P>
<P>
   But Xabier Arzalluz, the head of the moderate Basque Nationalist
Party, questioned whether ETA would actually ``carry through on its
threat'' to resume attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Arzalluz's party governs in the Basque regional parliament with
support from the Euskal Herritarrok _ or Basque Citizens _
coalition that is considered to be ETA's political wing. He blamed
both the rebels and the Spanish government for bungling the chance
to convert the cease-fire into a lasting peace, and he denied the
rebels' accusation that his moderate nationalists had not done
their part for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Aznar, who survived a rebel car bomb attempt on his life in
1995, said that since the cease-fire had begun his government had
opened the door for many Basque separatists in exile to return to
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The government has also released more than 130 rebel prisoners,
who were convicted or awaiting trial, and has transferred dozens
more to jails closer to their homes in the Basque region. But for
the rebels, these moves were apparently not enough.

ONLINE RETAILERS HAVE VISIONS OF HOLIDAY SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For many Internet retailers, success this holiday shopping
season rests on the shoulders of the customer service team or the
technical support staff _ whose job it is to keep a Web site from
crashing. But for executives of Bluefly.com, a discount apparel
merchant, success rides on the back of a Himalayan mountain goat _
the source of Pashmina.
</P>
<P>
   Pashmina has turned out to be the season's must-have fabric _ a
cashmere blended with silk to produce shawls and scarves of great
warmth, and even greater cachet. Bluefly executives had decided to
build the site's holiday promotions around their Pashmina items,
but they hit a slight snag when, two weeks ago, they sold out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's walking around asking when the Pashmina's coming in
because everything's on hold until then,'' said Jonathan Morris,
Bluefly's executive vice president. ``It's like the Furby of the
fashion world.''
</P>
<P>
   Such glitches are but one version of the nightmares before
Christmas that may be haunting many an e-commerce executive the
next month. Some Internet retailers, including Toys ``R'' Us, have
already had problems on their sites, while others are struggling to
fill open seams in their order processing and customer service
systems.
</P>
<P>
   But ready or not, the e-tailing rush is under way. Internet
shopping surveys indicate that online holiday spending started in
earnest the 10 days before Thanksgiving. Forecasts call for more
than 20 million holiday shoppers to click up $6 billion or more in
purchases, or triple last year's holiday total. And while retailers
focus on this year's action, they know that any breakdowns will
jeopardize next year's sales.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, some Web sites were already straining to keep up
with demand. KBkids.com, a partnership of KB Toys and BrainPlay.com
turned away some shoppers because it was overloaded for parts of
the day. And both eToys and Amazon.com said they were already out
of some Pokemon toys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between Christmas '98 and '99 online is that
last year, there were simple failures, like sites not working
properly, that consumers were relatively OK with because everyone
had the same problems,'' said Ford Cavallari, executive vice
president of Renaissance Worldwide, a strategy consulting firm.
``This year consumers expect more, and a lot of sites won't be able
to deliver.''
</P>
<P>
   While nearly every e-commerce executive interviewed acknowledges
losing sleep over holiday-shopping jitters, the ones with the worst
insomnia are probably the retailers who are entering their first
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing that pops me out of bed in a bad dream is a
major critical system failure where the site goes boom,'' said
Michael Clebnik, chief executive of BuyItOnline.com, a new online
mall. ``I think that's true for any company that's going through
its growth stages like us, where we're not in a financial position
to spend tens of millions to say `Here, buy as many servers as you
need so we can scale to the size of Yahoo.'''
</P>
<P>
   Clebnik, who began operations in May, said he planned to add
servers _ the workhorse computers that support the site _ in
sufficient numbers to ensure a 50 percent buffer between peak
traffic and total system capacity. He has also set up a backup
database for customer order and billing information, in case the
first database fizzles. ``We have to do it,'' he said. ``Any loss
of confidence in our system is critical.''
</P>
<P>
   Even for more experienced e-commerce sites, like Garden.com,
this is a worry. Garden.com, a purveyor of cut flowers and
gardening supplies, has three holiday seasons under its belt. But
this year the company has added more sophisticated features to its
site _ like the ability to recognize each returning customer and
display a personalized page.
</P>
<P>
   ``So not only is our traffic going up, but what customers do
while they're on the site is hitting our database more,'' said
Cliff Sharples, Garden.com's chief executive, adding that the
company spent between $2 million and $3 million in August for a
systems upgrade to handle the increased usage.
</P>
<P>
   John Hnanicek, chief information officer of eToys, said his
company spent ``in the seven figures'' last month on a system that
gauges the site's performance every 20 seconds, and alerts
executives to any performance lags. ``It lets me sleep well because
I know I'll get a phone call if there's anything to worry about,''
he said. So far, at least, there have been no nocturnal calls.
</P>
<P>
   More pressing for Hnanicek and others, perhaps, is the issue of
so-called fulfillment _ actually processing and shipping what the
customer has ordered. According to Jupiter Communications, the top
Internet retailers can each expect to process 58,000 orders each
day, and they will have to impress upon warehouse workers the
urgency of picking, packing and shipping as if the entire business
were at stake. Instilling that sense of mission can be difficult,
however, when those workers are third-party vendors, as is so often
the case with e-commerce companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the fun things about eToys,'' said Hnanicek, who
spoke from Fingerhut's Provo, Utah, warehouse, which handles a
large percentage of eToys' shipments. ``When we talk to the staff
here, we can ascribe a little higher meaning to the stuff we sell,
because they're bringing Christmas to kids. It's not like we're
selling auto parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris, of Bluefly, which is based in New York, said his site's
fulfillment and marketing anxieties should subside within a week,
when a shipment of several thousand Pashmina scarves and shawls is
expected to arrive at the Chicago company, Marketing Out of the
Box, that handles Bluefly's fulfillment. Beyond that, he said he is
most concerned about preparing the customer service staff _
``especially in the early in the season, because there's a chance
for repeat purchase and good word-of-mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Bluefly's 10 full-time and three part-time customer
service representatives will be bolstered by employees from other
departments to cover the expected 400 daily inquiries by telephone
and e-mail during the holiday rush. ``Don't be surprised if you
call customer service and I pick up the phone,'' Morris said. ``I'm
not sure you want that, but it may happen.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Within the realms of fulfillment, customer service and site
performance, there is an almost endless list of places where a site
can fail, said Cavallari, of Renaissance Worldwide. He cited at
least a dozen areas of vulnerability, including the failure of
systems to allow an order to be modified once it has been placed.
Another shortcoming is the inability of many sites to recognize
when a customer has typed a zip code that either does not exist or
does not correspond to the shipping address.
</P>
<P>
   Most alarming, perhaps, is the fact that in the age of
``fully-integrated, end-to-end software solutions,'' some sites are
still typing in customer orders by hand. ``You'd be surprised at
how many sites are rekeying data,'' said Cavallari. ``At least half
of all commerce sites are duct-taped and glued in a similar
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   While new e-commerce companies can expect to suffer from rookie
mistakes, traditional retailers are not invulnerable. ``A lot of
older retailers with 10-year-old warehouse database systems are
trying to link their Web pages to them, and they're using the duct
tape and glue approach,'' Cavallari said. Given that approach and
the difficulty of keeping up with every aspect of critical systems,
he said, ``It's scary when you think about all the places where a
site can break down.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilary Billings, chief executive of RedEnvelope.com, an online
gift retailer founded in 1997 and formerly known as 911Gifts.com,
said to gird against any last-minute failures the company recently
simulated a peak traffic day. She declined to provide specifics,
other than to say that the test went well. ``Now we just have to do
it when the real peak day comes,'' she said. Ms. Billings expects
that day to be Monday, Dec. 20, as last-minute shoppers try to beat
the express-delivery deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   To handle the strain, Ms. Billings said the company had sought
to inject as much flexibility into its systems as possible. ``We
can get more fulfillment space, more customer service reps, and
more inventory if we need to,'' she said, noting that the site can
serve 10 times the number of visitors it served last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, this is the scariest holiday season I've ever faced in
my history as a retailer,'' said Ms. Billings, who previously
worked seven years for Pottery Barn's catalog and retail operation.
``There are just so many unknowns.''

GIFTS FOR CELEBRATING THE CENTURY OR JUST RELAXING

<P>
   Well, they finally did it. The publisher Benedikt Taschen has
issued a book called ``Sumo,'' a collection of photographs by
Helmut Newton, edited by his wife, June Newton. Which may sound
innocent enough. But here's the thing: It's 465 pages long,
measures 20 by 28 by 4 inches, weighs 66 pounds and comes with its
own chromed stainless-steel folding table designed by Philippe
Starck. So the dream of Seinfeld's Kramer of a coffee-table book
that is actually a coffee table has been all but realized.
</P>
<P>
   Because ``Sumo'' bears a price tag of $1,500, a review copy was
understandably not sent to this office. I therefore can't recommend
it as a gift this season. But the following books, arranged by
ascending price, will do very well in its place.

<P>
   INTERNET COOL GUIDE, edited by Rula Razek. Designed by Tika
Buchanan and James Tung of Eric Baker Design Associates, N.Y. (187
pages. Te Neues Publishing Co. Paperback, $14.95.) OK, so this
guide to the 1,000 best Web sites will probably be obsolete by the
day after tomorrow. But in the meantime there's lots of useful
advice here on search engines and how to use them for everything
from buying a car online to playing chess against Gary Kasparov.
And you can get updates on www.internetcoolguide.com.
</P>
<P>
   HOME COMFORTS: The Art and Science of Keeping House, by Cheryl
Mendelson. Illustrations by Harry Bates. (884 pages. Scribner.
$35.) A guide to all the domestic arts _ from choosing fabrics to
folding sheets to mending book bindings to throwing out old
documents _ by an articulate, witty woman who is a philosopher,
lawyer, sometime professor and a homemaker, wife and mother all
rolled into one.
</P>
<P>
   SAVEUR COOKS AUTHENTIC FRENCH, by the editors of Saveur
Magazine. Designed by Jill Armus, Michael Grossman and Amy
Henderson. (320 pages. Chronicle Books. $40.) This sequel to last
year's ``Saveur Cooks Authentic American'' explores the traditions
of French cuisine _ particularly those of Burgundy, Alsace, the
Southwest, Provence and a few others _ and is packed with
illustrations that look good enough to ... well, send you out
looking for truffles, duck's liver and frog's legs.
</P>
<P>
   FULL MOON, by Michael Light. Essay by Andrew Chaikin. (Unpaged.
Alfred A. Knopf. $50.) In case you haven't gone there yet, these
magnificent two-page (and occasionally four-page) spreads, newly
released by NASA, capture the visual sensation of landing on,
walking around and taking off from the mysteriously beautiful
landscape of the Moon. Published on the 30th anniversary of Apollo
II, the first moon voyage, it answers some of the questions posed
by Les Paul and Mary Ford in the song ``How High the Moon?''
</P>
<P>
   Looking in another direction, namely back over the last hundred
years, the following four volumes view the 20th century from
multiple perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   The first _ CENTURY: One Hundred Years of Human Progress,
Regression, Suffering and Hope, conceived and edited by Bruce
Bernard (1,120 pages; Phaidon Press; $49.95) _ is a history told in
more than 1,100 photographs, many familiar, some never before
published. The juxtapositions are often shocking _ President
Kennedy at a street party in Ireland across from the moment of the
second Oswald shot _ and remind you that these truly have been the
best and worst of times.
</P>
<P>
   The next two _ THE AMERICAN CENTURY: Art and Culture 1900-1950;
by Barbara Haskell (408 pages; $60) and THE AMERICAN CENTURY: Art
and Culture 1950-2000, by Lisa Phillips (398 pages; $60; both
published by the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, in
association with W.W. Norton) _ offer rich records of the recent
shows at the Whitney, considering American art as a response to
political, social and economics conditions, and tracing its
expression in painting, sculpture, photography, architecture, film,
literature, dance, theater, music and the decorative arts.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, THE LOOK OF THE CENTURY, by Michael Tambini (288
pages; DK Publishing; $39.95), a striking visual record of how
changes in taste have been reflected in everything from furniture
to cereal boxes, from Coca-Cola bottles to the Porsche 911.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As always, the Bronx is up and the Battery's down in NEW YORK:
An Illustrated History; narrative by Ric Burns and James Sanders;
picture editor, Lisa Ades (575 pages; Alfred A. Knopf; $60) and NEW
YORK 1880: Architecture and Urbanism in the Gilded Age, by Robert
A.M. Stern, Thomas Mellins and David Fishman (1,164 pages;
Monacelli Press; $85). But the first, a companion to the PBS
television series, also shows the city from its beginnings to the
present, while the second concentrates on a period of great
technological change that transformed the city from a harbor town
to a world-class metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN. Photographs by Annie Leibovitz. Essay by Susan Sontag.
(239 pages. Random House. $75.) The haunting images in this
mesmerizing book show women in such astonishing variety that no
cliche or generalization about the sex will ever again suffice.
</P>
<P>
   Here are two volumes filled with waters so beautiful that one
finds it hard to understand how anyone could resist the sport of
fishing. The first, TROUT AND SALMON. Photography by R. Valentine
Atkinson (176 pages; Lyons Press; $39.95), sends you all over the
world: to Ireland, Chile, Norway and Russia, among other places
ridden with magnificent fish. The second, LAND OF LITTLE RIVERS: A
Story in Photos of Catskill Fly Fishing, by Austin McK. Francis;
photography by Enrico Ferorelli (279 pages; Beaverkill Press;
distributed by W.W. Norton. $100), zeroes in on the birthplace of
American fly fishing and shows you not only fish and waters but
also the people and equipment that helped to develop a great sport.
</P>
<P>
   AFRICAN CEREMONIES, by Carol Beckwith and Angela Fisher. (Two
volumes slip-cased: Vol. 1, 384 pages; Vol. 2, 360 pages. Harry N.
Abrams, $150.) A monumental survey in pictures and text of tribal
rituals, rites and ceremonies across the entire continent, spanning
the human life cycle, birth, puberty, courtship and marriage,
illness and death. Arresting views, often forbidden to outsiders,
into the heart of humanity.
</P>
<P>
   THE BEST OF FLAIR. Edited by Fleur Cowles. Foreword by Dominick
Dunne. (337 pages. Rizzoli International Publications. Boxed,
$250.) Remember Flair magazine (which ran for 12 months, February
1950 to January 1951), with its elegant design and its accordion
foldouts once celebrated in a New Yorker cartoon showing a reader
with an extra arm and hand, and its reputation for being either too
lavish or too far ahead of its time? You don't? Well, here's the
best of it, with prose by Winston Churchill, George Bernard Shaw
and Tallulah Bankhead, among others, and with lots of pages to keep
your two hands busy. In a bright red folding box that will look
great on the coffee table even if you never crack it open.
</P>
<P>
   And a happy holiday.

   DEDELEBEN, Germany _ Ruediger Hinze took a scrap of paper from
his glasses-case and read four names: Jaeger, Kopp, Schulze and
Schreiber. ``Those are the code names,'' he said, ``of the people
in this village who spied on me for years.''
</P>
<P>
   A retired teacher, Hinze keeps the list of false identities with
his glasses in order to be regularly reminded of the people who
spent years recording each person he met, each card game he played,
each word he uttered _ and then passing on the information to the
former East German state security service, or Stasi.
</P>
<P>
   This village of 1,200 people was close enough to the former
border with West Germany to be of particular interest to the
Communist secret police. A teacher like Hinze who was disinclined
to sing the praises of Bolshevism was a reasonable target for
inclusion in the 125 miles of files that are the legacy of perhaps
the most spied-on society in history.
</P>
<P>
   Like many people in Germany, and in other post-Communist states
in central and eastern Europe, Hinze, 54, has recently read his
Stasi file. The 100 pages have left him stunned, perplexed. Who
informed on him? Why such detail? How could he live in such a
society?
</P>
<P>
   These are questions that haunt millions of Europeans even a
decade after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Indeed, in Germany at
least, the tide of questioning is rising.
</P>
<P>
   When Hitler's Reich collapsed in 1945, Germans spent 20 years
avoiding a full confrontation with Nazism. German valor at
Stalingrad outweighed German murder at Treblinka. Only under the
insistent pressure of the post-war generation in West Germany _ the
1960s revolutionaries who are the rulers of today _ was history
stared in the face.
</P>
<P>
   Erich Honecker, long the leader of East Germany, was not Hitler.
But his police state of 17 million people boasted 95,000 full-time
Stasi agents, more than double the number of Gestapo agents in Nazi
Germany for a population four times bigger. And, as in the post-war
period, a delayed reaction to the trauma of dictatorship is
becoming clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Applications to see Stasi files are rising sharply and now run
at 15,000 a month from individuals,'' said Johannes Legner, a
senior official at the government body that oversees the 6 million
files. ``It's the same story as in 1945: partial amnesia is
followed by awakening. I believe the real wave of interest and
generational conflict are still to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Legner was born in 1954. He recalls asking his parents: What
about Auschwitz? He is convinced similar questions will come from
the generation born in the decade since communism collapsed: Were
you a secret informer for the Stasi? How could you live and look at
that Wall? How did it feel to be part of a police state?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the very existence of the government commission for
which Legner works and the access to their Stasi files granted
German citizens shows the lengths to which Germany is going to be
more open about its history than it was in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in central and eastern Europe, countries have wrestled
in different ways with the issues of justice and reconciliation,
but in general few former Communists have served jail sentences,
and the vetting process to keep state positions free of convinced
Bolsheviks is slowly winding down.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Republic is immeasurably more democratic in its soul
and in its convictions than the shell-shocked ``Volk'' that emerged
from the rubble of Hitler's war or any incarnation of Germany since
the modern state was formed in 1871.
</P>
<P>
   But the trauma of the Stasi still inhabits German society,
adding another layer of suspicion and interrogation to a society
that has already spent over half a century trying to comprehend the
incomprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   A few trials and convictions _ including the recent one of Egon
Krenz, the last East German leader and longtime head of state
security _ have done little to heal wounds that lie deep, or to
satisfy Germans that any form of justice is possible for intrusions
into their lives that are still not fully understood.
</P>
<P>
   At the most immediate level, the confrontation with what the
East German state security apparatus did is simply not over yet.
Over 300,000 people are waiting to see their files, and the wait is
generally at least two years from the time an application is filed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a vetting process continues. About 1.6 million
people in public service, including teachers and police officers,
have already been vetted, and about 20,000 remain to be processed
by the so-called Gauck Commission, named after the Rev. Joachim
Gauck, a former East German dissident, who heads the body
overseeing Stasi files.
</P>
<P>
   The vetting does not always lead to dismissal: in the east
German state of Saxony Anhalt, for example, only one third of the
teachers known to have had contact with the Stasi have been
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Discretion is widely used by the Gauck Commission in the hope
that people who may have spied under extreme pressure will be able
to start anew.
</P>
<P>
   Demands from public entities and private companies for such
vetting is declining. But with personal applications to see files
going up from 10,000 to 15,000 a month, there is no prospect that
the commission, with its 2,800 employees, will be disbanded.

 DEDELEBEN, Germany: be disbanded. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at a deeper level, the impact of the Stasi is
becoming clear. East Germany was a sophisticated repressive
society. After the violence of the Stalinist period, the state _
like others in central Europe and the Balkans _ did not employ
murder on a wide scale. Rather its aim was what the Stasi called
``the decomposition'' of people.
</P>
<P>
   Decomposition meant blocking people from acting. It meant
paralyzing them as citizens by convincing them everything was
controlled. It meant the relentless application of a quiet coercion
leading to compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the East German state, it was better to have no activity
than an activity out of the Stasi's control,'' said Legner, who
lived in West Berlin during most of the Cold War years. ``So no
wonder many Germans in the east are unable to act on their own free
will today.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, among older East Germans, this fear of personal
initiative and sense of dependence on a state long seen as
omnipotent have contributed to the unemployment rate of close to 20
percent in what was East Germany. The risk inherent to capitalism
is simply alien; worse, it is threatening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all children of the East German state,'' said Klaus
Mueller, a former officer in Honecker's army. ``We believed what we
were told and we did what we were told, in the defense of
socialism.''
</P>
<P>
   Mueller, 47, has managed to recycle himself in a united Germany
as a member of the border police at the Polish frontier. ``When I
took off my uniform, I also stepped out of my ideology,'' he said.
``Socialism was gone, we were told it was false, and so I started
to think again.''
</P>
<P>
   But such chameleonic changes of identity _ and there are
millions of them in Germany, as across central and eastern Europe _
and the realization that there were as many as 160,000 unofficial
informers for the Stasi have contributed to the sort of unease felt
by Hinze, the teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, the former Communist world is still a place where
the true identity of even an old acquaintance may be difficult to
fathom.
</P>
<P>
   Swelling from cancer has twisted Hinze's mouth into a grimace.
As a result, his voice is indistinct. But the fierce intelligence
in his deep blue eyes is clear enough, as is his conviction that
the East German state broke him.
</P>
<P>
   After the Berlin Wall fell, he waited several years to file an
application to see his Stasi file. Then, it took four years for his
application to be approved. Finally, earlier this year, he read the
file.
</P>
<P>
   Much of it was devoted to his standing in the village _ his
popularity (high), his friends (numerous), his reputation at the
school (good). It was noted _ against him _ that he preferred to
teach the lower school classes, where instruction in the glories of
socialism and the feats of the October Revolution was not
prominent.
</P>
<P>
   The file recorded that Mr Hinze had been approached by the Stasi
in 1974, when he was 29, and offered the opportunity to become an
agent. When he declined, he had to formulate in writing why he
would not do such work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote that I could not do it because I would not be able to
look my family, my friends and my colleagues in the eye,'' Hinze
recalled. ``I also had to formally agree to tell nobody that I had
been approached, or face the threat of what they called `state
measures.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The experience was psychologically devastating. The meaning of
``state measures'' was well known: imprisonment and likely torture.
The message of the Stasi was also clear enough: If you do not work
with us, you are against us. It proved hugely effective in a
society fashioned after the war to go on prizing obedience.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that amazed me was the resources devoted to my
trivial case,'' said Hinze. ``It became clear to me reading that
file that East Germany went bankrupt in part because all the hard
currency, all the top talent, was devoted to the Stasi.''
</P>
<P>
   The former teacher, who has received an early pension because of
his illness, has now written to the Gauck Commission to see if he
can discover the real identities behind those code names: Jaeger,
Kopp, Schulze and Schreiber.
</P>
<P>
   He says he is driven by interest rather than any desire for
revenge. ``I am reconciled, I would not confront them.''
</P>
<P>
   The true names may be known to the Gauck Commission or may not,
because some Stasi files were destroyed and many of the most
sensitive archives were spirited away and later acquired, probably
in Russia, by the Central Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The long reluctance of the CIA to return these files has been a
source of friction between the United State and Germany, although
an accord on giving back most of them has now been reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, this is a matter of basic civil rights,'' said Legner.
``This information was collected by Germans and belongs here. There
are plenty of people whose lives have been destroyed and all we
have is a code name for the person who did it. And the CIA is
sitting on that code, so we cannot identify who destroyed someone's
life.''
</P>
<P>
   With the expected return of many of the files next year, it
seems likely that hundreds or even thousands of former Stasi agents
still in prominent positions may be exposed. But, of course, the
files will not bring back the dead, patch up damaged lives like
Hinze's or stanch the rising interest in who worked for the Stasi
and why.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best you can hope for is a dialogue where the perpetrators
confess and so you have the confession as a consolation,'' said
Legner. ``But I must say that when a man I now know spied on me in
East Berlin calls and wants to talk, perhaps to excuse himself, I
put the phone down. Refusing to speak to him is my own little
punishment.''

WEB SITES AND RECORDING LABELS AT IMPASSE ON FEES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A growing number of Web sites are offering customized music
programming _ song sets created in response to the personal tastes
of listeners. What the listeners are not hearing is a
behind-the-scenes dispute between the sites and major record
labels, in which tens of millions of dollars may be at stake.
</P>
<P>
   The basic issue is how much these Web sites should reimburse
record labels each time they play recordings owned by the labels.
Months of discussions between trade groups representing the two
sides recently petered out, so the issue is set for arbitration
next year. Meanwhile, some Webcasters have been negotiating
individual royalty licenses with the recording industry.
</P>
<P>
   Because the sites are permitted to continue playing music until
arbitration is completed, the issue may seem insignificant to the
growing number of Internet listeners. But the question may not be
so insignificant to investors in the Web sites, which include
Launch Media, NetRadio, SonicNet (owned by Viacom's MTV) and
Spinner.com (owned by America Online). The royalty fees paid to the
record industry ultimately could become a substantial business
expense.
</P>
<P>
   The stage for the royalty dispute was set in late 1998, when
Congress passed and President Clinton signed the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act. Like broadcast radio stations, Webcasters are
required to pay licensing fees to copyright owners through Ascap or
BMI, which collect royalties. But on the assumption that digital
distribution raises additional intellectual property issues because
it allows for high-quality copying, the new law requires Webcasters
to pay a licensing fee to record labels that is not required of
broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   The law did not set a rate for royalty payments by the Internet
companies but did provide for arbitration if the two sides could
not reach an agreement. Trade groups for both sides say the
negotiations, which began early this year, never went much beyond
exploratory talks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the two sides are scheduled to file position papers next
month with a three-person arbitration panel to be appointed by the
U.S. Copyright Office. A request by the recording industry for a
deadline extension, filed last week, is still pending.
</P>
<P>
   People involved in the discussions between individual Web sites
and record companies have said the royalty percentages being asked
by the labels range as high as 15 percent of a site's gross
revenues. Lobbyists for the Web sites say they are arguing for as
low as 1 to 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There are also open questions about how a Web site would even
measure revenue for purposes of royalty payments _ whether the
count would include advertising, transactions or subscription
revenue, or some combination of the three.
</P>
<P>
   Steven M. Marks, senior vice president for business affairs for
the Recording Industry Association of America, which is
representing major record labels, declined to say what percentage
the industry hopes to secure in the arbitration process. But he
said the figure should reflect the music's value to the Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're paying for the right to build a business using the
content that's been created by record companies and artists,''
Marks said
</P>
<P>
   The Web companies contend that they already are putting money in
the pockets of the recording industry because they are helping to
spur album sales. Further, the sites argue that the royalties
should only be paid on revenue directly related to the use of a
copyrighted song, such as from a banner advertisement displayed
while a song is played.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're paying for a performance right, we're not paying for the
right to be in business,'' said Jonathan Potter, director of the
Digital Media Association, a trade group that includes many of the
large music Webcasters. Potter said the recording industry had
approached individual Webcasters asking for 15 percent of gross
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   What both sides agree upon is that customized, Internet-based
``radio'' is a growing force. The concept is that Web sites poll
listeners for their music preferences, both artist and genre. The
sites then create hundreds of radio ``stations,'' each reflecting
the musical tastes of a narrow category of visitors to their sites.
The categories listed under Vintage Rock on Spinner.com, for
example, include British invasion, psychedelic and surf.
</P>
<P>
   A survey published two weeks ago indicates that online radio
listening is popular among college students. Webnoize, an online
publication covering the new media music industry, found that of
4,000 students surveyed, 63.4 percent were interested in Internet
radio for niche programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a great demand for these services,'' said
Joanne Marino, editor in chief of Webnoize, who said Web
communities like Yahoo or Geocities may find it necessary to add a
personalized radio component to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Marks, from the Recording Industry Association of America, said
the record industry had signed many licensing deals with Webcasting
companies, but declined to provide a figure.
</P>
<P>
   The association provided the name of only one company with which
it had reached a deal: Musicmusicmusic Inc., which operates a
service called RadioMoi.
</P>
<P>
   Besides that agreement, Potter of the Digital Music Association
said he knew of no other such licensing deals. He contends that the
record industry wants to make it seem that more deals have been
signed to induce Webcasters to negotiate individually, rather than
as a group through arbitration.

 FOR HOLIDAY SHOPPING, A BAG WORN LIKE A BACKPACK NEW SOFTWARE
DETERMINES COPYRIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; As the holidays approach, shopping for gifts and festive meals
becomes a major undertaking for many people. Just about everyone
knows what it is like to leave a store laden with shopping bags,
and since few do their holiday shopping with a backpack, a wheeled
cart or a valet, the plastic handles on those bags often end up
creating new indentations in fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mentken, a New York inventor, thinks shops and stores
should make it possible for customers to walk out with the weight
of their purchases evenly distributed across their shoulders. He
has patented a shopping bag that has back pack straps instead of
handles.
</P>
<P>
   Mentken's bag is built like a conventional grocery or shopping
bag. It is made of heavy paper, squared, with a flat bottom. It
opens to one big compartment. Called BakSak, it folds and unfolds
in the traditional fashion, and weighs about four ounces.
</P>
<P>
   But the bag has straps that are woven through the lip around the
opening. The straps project from one of the long sides of the
opening and extend in a half-loop to the bag bottom, where they are
secured with fasteners. The straps are flat and adjustable. A
cashier can put purchases into the bag and then shoppers can slip
their arms through the straps and hoist the bags onto their backs.
</P>
<P>
   Mentken believes that merchants should like his shopping bags
even more than the ones now in use because the bags will raise
their logos and brand names to eye level. Shoppers all over the
country could become walking advertisements with department store
and designer label bags on their backs. And their hands will be
free for more shopping. Mentken won patent 5,957,354.
</P>
<P>
   NEW SOFTWARE DETERMINES COPYRIGHT
</P>
<P>
   The Copyright Office no longer requires that material be
registered in order to gain copyright protection. Placing a
copyright symbol or notice on a written work, art work or
photograph, for example, serves the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
   But in the electronic age, when original works can be wholly
reproduced with the press of a computer key or the click of a
mouse, people who have created singular sites on the Internet
sometimes want greater reassurance that their compositions are
safeguarded against copying.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan Glogau, a Nanuet, N.Y., inventor has patented a software
program that evaluates the contents of a Web site and yields the
relevant registration forms for the U.S. Copyright Office.
</P>
<P>
   Glogau's software examines a site's structure and its features,
such as text, graphics or photographs, to determine what type of
work category each falls into. It accomplishes this by looking at
``tags'' on Web site files and file extensions _ the kind of codes
that identify, for example, whether a file contains a photograph.
The software then decides whether the registration form should be
accompanied by a printed copy of the Web site features involved.
</P>
<P>
   After breaking down the site, the software asks the user whether
he wants to register each feature individually. The user can also
choose to include each component in the registration of the entire
site as one copyrighted entity. Glogau received patent 5,983,351.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ To a backdrop of glittery chandeliers and somber marble
pillars in a financial-district conference room, Christopher Gent,
the smooth-talking chief executive of the world's biggest mobile
phone company, was outlining his designs on German rival Mannesmann
the other day when, unusually, he seemed to stumble over a word.
</P>
<P>
   Gent, the chief executive of Vodafone AirTouch, was discussing
the web of deals that girds the globe's wireless networks, and he
was talking about companies already under his control. What
emerged, though, was not ``companies'' but ``countries'' _ as if,
in this era of corporate hubris and consolidation, boardrooms have
supplanted nations in creating the empires that will rule the
digital millennium.
</P>
<P>
   That may seem to be a lot of freight to load onto a simple slip
of the tongue, of course.
</P>
<P>
   But, considering that Gent (pronounced JENT) was discussing
global expansion and control, an observer might be forgiven for
sensing imperial overtones. As in the lands that Britain still
ruled when he was born 51 years ago, the sun never sets either on
Gent's realm of wireless networks from the United States to
Australia, or on his ambition to expand his empire.
</P>
<P>
   This year alone, with dizzying speed, Gent has moved from the
$60 billion acquisition of AirTouch last January, through a summer
dominated by negotiating a joint venture with Bell Atlantic _ which
he outbid to secure AirTouch _ to create the biggest wireless
network in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Now, spurred by Mannesmann's own imperialistic effort to acquire
Britain's No. 3 wireless operator, Orange PLC, Gent has moved on to
history's largest takeover bid: a roughly $127 billion all-stock
mammoth of a hostile move on Mannesmann. Success by Vodafone would
give the combined companies stakes or control in 25 countries with
full or partial access to the mobile phone use of 73 million people
_ including the biggest cellular markets in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday evening, Mannesmann's supervisory board _ the equivalent
of a board of directors _ met in Duesseldorf, Germany, and, as
expected, voted to reject Vodafone's takeover offer. German news
reports indicated that several board members had wanted the company
to consider negotiations, but Mannesmann's chairman, Klaus Esser,
adamantly ruled that out.
</P>
<P>
   Gent declined to be interviewed. But in his recent
conference-room remarks he said that if the hostile bid succeeded,
``we will operate the largest wireless networks in the world This
combination puts us in pole position for the wireless data and
Internet future.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but a combination with Mannesmann would position
Vodafone to challenge oil giant BP Amoco as Britain's largest
company, with a market value of more than $250 billion _ quite a
rise for a company that began life less than a decade ago as a
fledgling contender in the untested mobile phone market. And most
of that expansion has come in the brief two years and 11 months
since Gent took over as chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the man behind the imperial vision somehow remains elusive,
showing a regard for personal privacy as steely as the
determination of his deal making. The Vodafone official biography
of Gent simply skips from his appointment in 1985 as an executive
of Racal Electronics _ the parent of Vodafone before it was spun
off in 1988 _ to his becoming chief executive of Vodafone in 1997.
Initially, he secured the company's dominance in Britain's
rough-and-tumble mobile phone business before venturing into
megamergers. ``He put his own back yard in order before some of the
bigger deals,'' an aide said.
</P>
<P>
   The official biography makes no allusion to his family or social
life, beyond his love of tennis and cricket. Publicly, at least,
Gent offers a seamless image of unflappability: Even barbed
questions comparing radiation from mobile phones to smoke from
cigarettes as a health hazard fail to ignite a spark of anger or
defensiveness and are rebuffed with well-rehearsed
counterarguments. Newspaper articles note that he drives an Aston
Martin sports car, but associates say playboy connotations or a
quest for ego-tripping celebrity are wide of the mark for a man
with a young son from a second marriage that he wishes to shield
from publicity's glare.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does have a car like that, but I suspect it gathers dust in
the garage,'' said a business associate who spoke in return for
anonymity. ``It's not like he's driving it around all the time. He
works too hard. He's not a mega-ego kind of guy. He has a lot of
confidence, but he doesn't feel the need to show off.''
</P>
<P>
   So what does drive him? Of course, it could just be money,
although that does not seem to be the entire story. In a recent
ranking compiled by The Sunday Times of London, Gent emerged as
only Britain's seventh-best-paid chief executive with a basic
salary of $1.07 million, multiplied eightfold by stock incentives
and bonuses to $8.57 million.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his recent stock option disposals, his aides say, were
related to paying for his divorce from his first wife. He remarried
earlier this year and lives with his second wife, Kate, in a large
house on about two acres in the Lambourne Valley _ horse-rearing
country close to Vodafone's rambling corporate headquarters,
according to Mike Caldwell, Vodafone's head of corporate
communications. It is a token of Vodafone's helter-skelter growth
that the headquarters occupies a staggering 58 separate buildings
at Newbury, west of London.
</P>
<P>
   In class-ridden Britain, achievement is gauged not only in
pounds and pence, but in the ability to crash the barriers that _
certainly in Gent's formative years _ would have divided the upper
crust from the rest. ``His father died when he was quite young. He
didn't go to college and he's very driven to achieve a high
level,'' the business associate said. ``In Britain, people often
find it very difficult not being from a particular background. He's
cut through all that.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, that makes Gent rather similar to an old friend of
his, former Prime Minister John Major. Both left school to go to
work in their teens _ Gent as a trainee bank manager, Major as a
clerk at an insurance brokerage. Both sought a political niche in
the Young Conservatives, of which Gent was national chairman from
1977 to 1979. Both, too, project the manner of a new, meritocratic
elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beautiful white collars and striped shirts, the tailoring
_ he does have a slightly patrician air,'' said a financial analyst
who has observed Gent's presentations and who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   And, like Major, Gent deploys what is most kindly described as a
dry, even acerbic, wit. Asked at a recent news conference what
mechanism he would use to put his merger proposals to Mannesmann's
supervisory board, he snapped back, ``It's known as a letter.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Gent has said he believed that revenue from
voice, data and Internet uses was the key to unlocking profit from
technological advances that are supposed to give wireless devices
much greater speed and capacity. ``We believe that the future of
telecommunications is wireless,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That is only one belief that has put him at loggerheads with
Mannesmann, which aims to build its empire on a combination of
fixed-line and wireless technology. Protesting Mannesmann workers
last week publicly compared Gent's appetites for expansion to those
of a shark. Indeed, in plunging into the cosseted world of German
labor relations, he may well have underestimated the likely
resistance of Mannesmann's 130,000 workers to what protesters
called ``the wild predator'' from a company called ``Voodoofone.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that, in launching his bid, Gent has shown
himself willing to do battle across one of the great divides of
corporate Europe. It is an effort that calls not just for business
acumen but also for the diplomatic skills to persuade German
politicians, industrialists and workers to countenance the first
ever cross-border raid on Germany Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the German image of Gent as a predator, though, he has
been more reactive than active as an aggressor. In both big merger
battles this year, Gent was initially caught off balance. News that
Bell Atlantic was competing for AirTouch came through last January
when he was away in Australia watching a match by his beloved
English cricket team, which Vodafone sponsors. And, last month, he
was at dinner when word reached him that Mannesmann was close to a
deal with Orange _ a move that would turn Mannesmann from being
Vodafone's most important European partner into a direct competitor
on its British home turf and a challenger for European domination.
</P>
<P>
   So how did he react?
</P>
<P>
   ``Furious would be too strong a statement,'' said Vodafone's
Mike Caldwell. ``Nonplused would be more like it because he thought
we were in the friendly camp with Mannesmann.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, when Gent resolved to make his hostile bid, ``most people
accept that as far as he's concerned it was a very difficult
decision to make,'' said Nigel Hawkins, a telecommunications
analyst with Williams de Broe brokerage. ``He didn't choose the
battleground or the timing.''

 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It makes for a dull ending to a long-running soap opera
that once entertained with spats, insults, scandals, brinkmanship
and frequent warnings of imminent disaster. But after four years of
unremitting melodrama, the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden has
completed a $360 million redevelopment and will reopen on schedule
on Dec. 1 with a gala of song and dance attended by Queen
Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   So all's well that ends well? Perhaps. The new opera house
should make life decidedly more pleasant for performers and
audiences: It includes a new studio theater, additional rehearsal
and dressing rooms, an expanded back stage and a large public foyer
to replace the aptly named Crush Bar. The auditorium, the only part
of the 19th-century theater that was not torn down and rebuilt
during the 30-month makeover, has even been given air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   After the likes of Placido Domingo and Sylvie Guillem reprise
the opening gala on Dec. 4, Covent Garden can at last return to its
proper business of presenting its divertissements on stage. The new
season begins Dec. 6 with six performances of a new production of
Verdi's ``Falstaff,'' with Bryn Terfel in the lead role, and five
evenings of international choreography, including a world premiere
by Siobhan Davies, presented by the Royal Ballet on Dec. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while the Royal Opera and the Royal Ballet can now boast a
home fit for the 21st century, the price has been high, and not
simply in monetary terms. By seeking a $125 million grant from
National Lottery profits to add to its annual subsidy from the
government, the opera house invited scrutiny by press, Parliament
and public. The resulting verdict was ferocious: that Covent Garden
was overstaffed, badly managed and elitist.
</P>
<P>
   Once the spotlight was on the house, worse followed. With London
tabloids gleefully reporting every twist and turn, two directors
came and went; senior staff members were fired; the director of
opera, Nicholas Payne, found a new job; the music director, Bernard
Haitink, resigned; and the government forced most board members to
step down.
</P>
<P>
   As the house's deficit mounted, opera and ballet shows planned
in other theaters during the closing were cut to a minimum. ``If
you asked people who hated the arts why they were so hostile, they
would reply, `Look at Covent Garden,''' the arts critic Richard
Morrison recalled recently in The Times of London. ``And if you
asked arts lovers why they were so gloomy, they would say exactly
the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Then last fall, with construction on the new theater advancing
steadily despite the turmoil, the new board chairman, Sir Colin
Southgate, chairman of EMI Records, took a gamble: He asked an
American, Michael Kaiser, executive director of the American Ballet
Theater at the time, to take over management of the Royal Opera
House. One year later Kaiser, a 46-year-old New Yorker, has lived
up to his reputation for turning troubled arts organizations
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of what has been achieved,'' he said in an interview
in his office in one of the new buildings now attached to the old
opera house. ``There was this mantra that the Royal Opera House has
good art and bad staff. It's not true. We have a superlative staff,
and they're putting the new building to work without a hiccup.''
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived last November, though, the battered morale of
Covent Garden's orchestra, chorus, dancers and staff was his first
problem. Unlike his immediate predecessors, however, he did not set
out to find scapegoats for the mess. Rather he focused attention on
the future and, reassuringly, Haitink rescinded his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser then restored some canceled productions outside the house
in 1999 and spent time getting to know dancers and musicians. Above
all he gave the impression of knowing what he was doing.
</P>
<P>
   On crucial money matters he soon demonstrated that he did know.
Coincidentally, as he was taking over, the Arts Council of England,
which funnels government money into the arts, reluctantly raised
its annual grant by $3 million to $32 million for 1999 and promised
an additional $6.4 million for 2000 and 2001. He nonetheless
inherited a $32 million deficit that thanks to staff cuts and fund
raising he now says will be eliminated by next March.
</P>
<P>
   Further, with $42 million in fresh private and corporate
donations in the last year, the house can now cover its $162
million share of the cost of the new building. (A further $73
million is assured by long-term rental of commercial street-front
space on a plaza behind the opera house.)
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser has also increased the number of Friends of Covent Garden
to 19,000 from 15,000, while, with an eye to the future, he has
instituted an Endowment Fund, with the target of raising $48
million within two years.
</P>
<P>
   But the Royal Opera House is not yet home free. British
newspapers have credited Kaiser with restoring some dignity to
Covent Garden, but memories of the fiasco of recent years continue
to feed skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the raw facts about Covent Garden are now well known:
that large amounts of public money _ whether lottery profits or tax
income _ benefit a small number of privileged opera and ballet
lovers, but that without that money Covent Garden would close.
</P>
<P>
   Put differently, while in the United States private donors
sustain major opera houses the way government subsidies do in
continental Europe, the Royal Opera House has floated uncomfortably
between these two models: It receives both public and private
funds, but it has had to charge high prices for most of its 2,300
seats.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Labor government, which took office in the middle of
Covent Garden's crisis, demanded that the ``new'' house lower its
prices. The house management replied: Fine, if the government picks
up the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Now some sort of compromise appears to have been worked out. The
government has raised its subsidy, and Kaiser has lowered the top
seat price for ``premium'' operas to $240 from $370. For many other
operas and ballets the top price will be $162. ``For a `standard'
opera,'' he said, ``more than half the seats will be less than $65
and more than half the seats for ballet will be less than $40.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem of who gets these seats has not gone away. Along
with major donors the 19,000 Friends of Covent Garden, who pay $90
annually, can buy tickets earlier than the public, which prompted
one tabloid to shout, ``Rich grab 80 percent of Royal Opera
seats.'' But Kaiser said that this was already an improvement on
the past, when on occasion all but a handful of tickets were sold
before the box office opened.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the new house is developing other ways of wooing
public opinion. The building will be open much of the day to
visitors, with free concerts organized in the Vilar Floral Hall,
the new foyer that now carries the name of Alberto Vilar, the
American philanthropist who donated $16 million to Covent Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Additional concerts and performances by outside companies will
be held in the 420-seat Linbury Studio Theater, while the public
will be invited to watch some Royal Ballet rehearsals in the new
Clore Studio Upstairs.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Perhaps inevitably, given all the new backstage machinery, some
teething problems have occurred, aggravated by Covent Garden's
decision to squeeze six different productions into the new house's
first six weeks. As a result 10 days before the reopening, six
performances of Ligeti's opera ``Le Grand Macabre,'' were canceled
to release stage time to rehearse the other productions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael's brilliant, but he doesn't actually walk on water,''
Amanda Jones, Covent Garden's press chief, explained.
</P>
<P>
   The true rebuilding of the Royal Opera House, however, will be
gauged by the quality of the productions in its main auditorium.
``In the end I won't feel it is a success if the art is not strong
and the balance sheet is good,'' Kaiser said. And here, after the
uncertainty of recent years, much work has still to be done.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Ballet, which suffered serious desertions during the
closure, is at least now installed in Covent Garden for the first
time; until now, its dancers had to commute across London between
their rehearsal studios and their performance stage. They also now
have what Kaiser calls ``the most beautiful ballet studios in the
world.'' But their transition may not end until a successor is
found to the ballet director, Sir Anthony Dowell, who retires in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   On the opera side Anthony Pappano has been chosen to succeed
Haitink as music director in 2002. And unlike Haitink, Pappano, a
London-born American conductor who is currently at the Theatre de
la Monnaie in Brussels, Belgium, will play an active role as
artistic director as well as permanent conductor; he reportedly
plans to spend seven months of every year in London.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea that Covent Garden is starting afresh comes through
all too clearly in its 1999-2000 opera season. Only ``Falstaff'' is
a new production; Harrison Birtwistle's ``Gawain,'' Wagner's
``Fliegende Hollaender'' and ``Meistersinger,'' Strauss'
``Rosenkavalier'' and Puccini's ``Boheme'' are revivals of Covent
Garden productions; and Mozart's ``Clemenza di Tito,'' Rossini's
``Otello,'' Gounod's ``Romeo et Juliette'' and Bohuslav Martinu's
``Greek Passion'' are co-productions that have already been
presented elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the optimist, though, Kaiser sees a silver lining even in
this lineup. ``We will shatter the elitist image by getting people
into the house at reasonable prices,'' he said. ``But if you look
at what we're offering this season, no one can say that we're
dumbing down.''

HSING-HSING, POPULAR GIANT PANDA, DIES AFTER LONG ILLNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hsing-Hsing, the National Zoo's giant panda who for
more than a quarter-century served as diplomat, research subject
and sweet-natured delight to millions, died Sunday morning.
Zookeepers gave the panda a lethal injection after deciding that
irreversible kidney disease had made his life too painful to
endure.
</P>
<P>
   He was 28, an extraordinarily advanced age for a panda.
</P>
<P>
   Hsing-Hsing and his longtime female denmate, Ling-Ling, who died
in 1992, were gifts to the United States from Mao Zedong in
commemoration of President Richard M. Nixon's ice-breaking trip to
China in 1972. The animals came to symbolize a deepening but
still-testy relationship between the world's most populous nation
and its wealthiest.
</P>
<P>
   The pandas mated frequently, on their own and with the aid of
science, but left no survivors. They produced five cubs between
1983 and 1989, but none lived more than five days.
</P>
<P>
   National Zoo officials said that Hsing-Hsing's health
deteriorated markedly in the past week. He was unresponsive to his
keepers, nearly blind, plagued with advanced arthritis and barely
able to rouse himself to eat.
</P>
<P>
   His final meal, on Saturday night, consisted of a large
blueberry muffin, boiled yams, a bit of rice broth and some bamboo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, after three very bad days, we decided to euthanize
him,'' said Lisa Stevens, the zoo's associate curator for primates
and pandas. ``We feel an immense sadness as well as an immense
emptiness, as empty as the Panda House is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Lu Wenxiang, a spokesman at the Chinese Embassy here, said that
he was ``sad and sorry'' to hear of the panda's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese government appreciates the effort and care shown
by the National Zoo and for their assistance in the preservation of
this rare animal,'' Lu said.
</P>
<P>
   From the first day that Hsing-Hsing and Ling-Ling were put on
display in April 1972, when 20,000 people flocked to the zoo to see
them, the animals were a huge draw. Zoo officials estimated that as
many as 75 million visitors saw one or both animals during their
long run in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Ling-Ling died on Sept. 30, 1992, at age 23 of sudden heart
failure. At the time, she was the oldest giant panda living in a
zoo outside China. The life expectancy for giant pandas in the wild
is 15 to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   With the death of Hsing-Hsing (prounounced Shing-Shing), there
are five remaining giant pandas living in the United States _ a
pair that arrived at Zoo Atlanta earlier this month and a pair with
a female cub at the San Diego Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the zoo in Washington said they were negotiating
with Beijing for pandas to replace Hsing-Hsing and Ling-Ling but
could not meet China's price. Beijing is seeking $1 million a year
for the loan of the animals; the National Zoo, part of the
Smithsonian Institution, is unwilling to pay more than $250,000 a
year because, unlike the zoos in Atlanta and San Diego, it does not
charge admission.
</P>
<P>
   National Zoo officials said that McKinley Hudson, the zoo's
deputy director, approved the decision to put Hsing-Hsing down on
Saturday after several days of discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a momentous decision,'' Hudson said. ``But at the end
he was not the Hsing we all knew and loved. In the long run, it
certainly was the best decision for Hsing.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are now conducting a detailed necropsy on the panda.
His skin and skeleton will be turned over to the Smithsonian's
Museum of Natural History, which also has custody of his mate's
remains. The bear's organs and tissues will remain at the zoo for
future study, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Ling-Ling has not been stuffed and her pelt has never been shown
to the public, but zoo officials did not rule out using the
animals' remains in a display in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Zoologists estimate that 1,000 giant pandas survive in the wild,
most in mountainous Central China, where they subsist almost
entirely on a diet of bamboo. In addition, 130 pandas live in zoos,
16 of them outside of China.
</P>
<P>
   Pandas have become a globally recognized symbol of the plight of
endangered species, a cuddly poster animal embraced almost
everywhere representing hundreds of less adorable plant and animal
species.
</P>

<P>
   The empty Panda House at the National Zoo was open Sunday, but
the entry bore a sign reading, ``We regret to inform you that
Hsing-Hsing died this morning, Sunday, November 28, 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, his glass-fronted den was half-covered with get-well
cards from schoolchildren. Visitors wandered past the exhibit,
lamenting their bad timing and pausing to read the notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Hsing-Hsing,'' read one in a thick-penciled scrawl. ``I
hope you feel good today. I care about you and I like you. Bye,
Donald.''

NEWSPAPERS CRITICIZE CIRCULATION AUDITOR  
 LESS ENTHUSIASM FOR NETWORKS' MUSIC PROJECTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Bylines follow individual items.)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pop quiz on the ABCs of the Audit Bureau of Circulations. Which
of the following counts as paid circulation, by the bureau's rules?
</P>
<P>
   (a) A copy of The Wall Street Journal, delivered to college
dormitory rooms and paid for in bulk by the college.
</P>
<P>
   (b) A home-delivered copy of The Rocky Mountain News, costing a
penny.
</P>
<P>
   (c) A copy of USA Today delivered to a hotel-room guest who did
not ask for it but did not tell the front desk not to deliver or
charge for it.
</P>
<P>
   (d) A copy of any local newspaper paid for in the ticket price
of participants in a convention.
</P>
<P>
   (e) The New York Times bought for the full price of 75 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Trick question: ``b,'' ``c,'' ``d'' and ``e'' count, and ``a''
does sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   Make sense? Not to a rump caucus of dissatisfied publishers. In
an era of eroding newspaper circulation, they see the audit
bureau's rules as capricious and the results irrational. This, in
turn, is straining the alliance of newspaper executives and
advertisers that governs ABC, which has been the final arbiter of
circulation claims for 85 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal, (paid circulation 1,753,000) was just
overtaken by USA Today (paid circulation 1,758,000). Dow Jones
executives, long irritated by the Gannett flagship's ability to
count hotel circulation, months ago started putting out a statement
of total circulation that reflects the ABC-approved figures and
adds bulk sales that may not count as paid circulation.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times and one of its competitors, The Orange
County Register, are upset that some discount plans, like Denver's,
count, while theirs may not. This month they have raised the ante
by finding an auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, to prepare a
circulation report in addition to the one they provide for the
audit bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still members of ABC,'' said Ronald Redfern, the
president and chief operating officer of The Register. But he
added, ``We are growing weary of dealing with the ABC and these
onerous rules. Standard measurements for everyone are important.''
So is ``gaining more readers for our advertisers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at other newspapers are watching the two newspapers
bid for independent review with interest and concern. The concern
is that circulation claims will no longer be comparable or
credible, and advertisers who have plenty of other media to choose
from may bolt rather than try to sort out truth from hype.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lavery, the president and managing director of the audit
bureau, said ``ABC's standards are such that they do provide
comparability in reporting.'' He added, ``This all goes back to
satisfying advertisers' needs.''

   Less Enthusiasm for Networks' Music Projects
</P>
<P>
   It was only a year ago that network movie executives were
speaking optimistically about commissioning music-based television
miniseries to cash in on the sales of related compact discs.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest television event last November, an NBC miniseries on
the Temptations, helped create momentum for the music-based idea by
generating big ratings and big sales for a CD, sold through an
``800'' telephone number. The momentum increased in February when a
second NBC music-oriented movie, ``The '60s,'' was such a hit that
its CD became the best-selling movie soundtrack on the Billboard
chart.
</P>
<P>
   That enthusiasm is starting to cool, at least at one network,
largely because the most ambitious music project this fall was
undone by ABC's rampaging _ and inexpensive _ ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' game show.
</P>
<P>
   The victim: a two-part CBS movie called ``Shake, Rattle and
Roll.''
</P>
<P>
   A fictionalized journey through the early rock 'n' roll years,
``Shake, Rattle and Roll'' included a list of ambitious songs, some
original (including songs by Bob Dylan, Lamont Dozier and Graham
Nash) and some covers of '50s hits by contemporary artists. CBS
promoted the film heavily and scheduled it on the first Sunday in
November.
</P>
<P>
   But that night Millionaire pushed ``Shake, Rattle and Roll'' to
a poor first-hour rating, and the show never recovered. Sales of
the CD have been similarly disappointing, though CBS declined to
cite specific figures. NBC itself helped undercut the CBS effort by
putting on its own rock 'n' roll movie, a biography of the disc
jockey Alan Freed, just a week earlier. Though its ratings were
less than stellar, the NBC movie may have helped sate viewers.
</P>
<P>
   One network did have a musical hit this November: ABC, in the
remake of ``Annie.'' But ABC did not make an effort to sell CDs of
the show through an ``800'' number, though it is selling the film
on video. ABC is planning more adaptations of big Broadway
musicals, with ``Mame'' and ``Music Man'' both in the works.
</P>
<P>
   NBC, meanwhile, still has ``The '70s'' from the same producers
as ``The '60s,'' ready for May. And it may commission a film on the
'50s rocker Little Richard.
</P>
<P>
   The network does plan to keep trying to sell CDs connected with
these projects. But the most ambitious talk of a regular
second-revenue stream has diminished.
</P>
<P>
   As for CBS, it has no music-based movie projects on its current
development slate, a network executive said.

ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND WEIGHS HOSTILE BID FOR NATIONAL WESTMINSTER
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Royal Bank of Scotland Group &UR;  &LR; is expected to make a
$41.71 billion hostile bid for National Westminster Bank as early
as Monday, executives who have been informed about the plan said
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   If Royal Bank of Scotland proceeds with an offer, it will touch
off a bidding war for NatWest. Its hometown rival, the Bank of
Scotland, has already made several offers for NatWest, Britain's
third-largest bank, but has been repeatedly spurned.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend saw last-minute efforts between Royal Bank of
Scotland and NatWest to broker a friendly merger. On Saturday
morning, George R. Mathewson and Fred Goodwin, the chief executive
and chief operating officer of Royal Bank of Scotland,
respectively, flew here from Edinburgh to meet with NatWest's
chairman, Sir David Rowland.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to trump the Bank of Scotland's most recent bid _ $41.3
billion, which NatWest rejected on Friday _ Royal Bank offered the
equivalent of $41.71 billion. The proposal, worth about 15.78
pounds a share ($25.33), called for Royal Bank to give one of its
own shares and 250 pence ($4.01) in cash for each share of Natwest,
according to executives close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   But after much back and forth, Sir David dismissed the offer as
too low, the executives said. NatWest hoped to hold out for 16.50
pounds ($26.49) a share and a larger cash component.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference Sunday afternoon, Sir David acknowledged
the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We concluded that the proposal as put forward did not warrant
a recommendation from the board, and so we rejected the offer,'' he
said. ``That's all I can say at this stage.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ron Sandler, chief operating officer of NatWest, added,
``It's very easy to stand on a soapbox and promise completely
unrealistic savings and performance targets,'' referring to Royal
Bank's proposal. ``These involve substantial risks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Royal Bank spokesman declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   If Royal Bank succeeds in acquiring NatWest, it would most
likely sell many of Natwest's noncore assets, executives close to
Royal Bank said. Those assets might include NatWest's fund
management unit, Gartmore Investment Management; its investment
banking unit, Greenwich NatWest; and its venture capital unit,
NatWest Equity Partners, as well as Ulster Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But NatWest has already said it would sell those assets as part
of its defense strategy to thwart its Scottish suitors. Analysts
estimate those units could raise about $6.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Bank has also drawn up plans to integrate the two banks'
computer systems _ a major cost that NatWest noted as a reason to
reject the Bank of Scotland's bid as inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst expressed a widely held view that if Royal Bank
makes a bid, it would be trumping the Bank of Scotland at its own
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, they've been playing cat and mouse for almost two
months already,'' said the analyst, who spoke on condition that he
not be named. ``It almost serves the Bank of Scotland right for not
sealing a deal earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that Royal Bank can achieve greater cost savings
than Bank of Scotland because it has more overlapping branches with
NatWest. Royal Bank has 300 branches in England, while the Bank of
Scotland has none.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also pointed out that, should the bidding escalate,
Royal Bank has the support of Banco Santander Central Hispano, &UR;  &LR; a
Spanish bank that has about a 10 percent stake in Royal Bank.
Executives close to Royal Bank said Banco Santander may provide
some of the cash for the bid.
</P>
<P>
   If Royal Bank does make an offer, it would reset the regulatory
clock in the NatWest bidding. Based on earlier rumblings, British
regulators had given Royal Bank a deadline of Dec. 8 to either make
a specific offer for NatWest or hold its peace. Regulators had also
imposed a Dec. 17 deadline on Bank of Scotland to make its best and
final offer _ a deadline that would be removed if Royal Bank now
enters the bidding in earnest.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Saturday night, NatWest released what was to have been its
final defense document in hopes of thwarting the Bank of Scotland.
NatWest pledged to cut cost by 525 million pounds by 2002 and said
it would buy back 2 billion pounds of its own shares. As part of
its defense strategy, NatWest also said it would cut 15,000 jobs,
up from 12,000 by 2002. The promised savings, however, still remain
below the Bank of Scotland's stated goal of squeezing 1.015 billion
pounds in costs from a combined company.
</P>
<P>
   Sandler, the NatWest executive, defended his company's plan.
``At least 300 million pounds of what Bank of Scotland is claiming
we know not to be achievable,'' he said. He also said that
NatWest's profitability from its core operations was 21 percent
higher than the Bank of Scotland's, implying that NatWest has a
better grasp of the banking business than does its pursuer.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Burt, chief executive of Bank of Scotland, responded to
Natwest's defense plan in a statement, saying, ``Its 11th-hour
final defense is painfully lame.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of NatWest increased 3.2 percent, to 1,518 pence on
Friday. Meanwhile, shares of Royal Bank dropped 1 percent, to 1,328
pence, and shares of the Bank of Scotland fell 5.6 percent to close
at 724 pence on Friday.

INTERNET LAW EXPERT RETURNS TO ANTITRUST CASE  
LEARNING TO LIVE WITH YEAR 2000 CONCERNS  
A SCHWAB MANAGER REVIEWS `Y2K: THE MOVIE' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Calif.)   (jw)

<P>
   He's back.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Lessig, a 38-year-old Harvard professor and Internet
law expert, has been recruited for the Microsoft antitrust case
once again. When U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
prodded the two sides toward settlement talks and appointed a
mediator on Nov. 18, he also said he wanted Lessig to write a
friend-of-the-court brief on his behalf on the issue of
technological tying.
</P>
<P>
   Lessig was removed from the case last year, after serving three
months as a special master _ an outside expert with a broad
mandate. Microsoft had protested, saying Lessig had a ``clear
bias'' against the company. Without addressing the bias claim, an
appeals court removed Lessig, ruling that the case was not an
appropriate one for a special master. This time, Microsoft has not
yet said whether it will object to Lessig.
</P>
<P>
   Reached last week in Berlin, where he has a research fellowship,
Lessig said he was eager to weigh in on the subject of so-called
product tying, which he called ``the toughest issue in the case.''
Jackson asked him to write a 50-page paper on it.
</P>
<P>
   The government has accused Microsoft of tying its Internet
browser to its monopoly product, the Windows operating system, in
an illegal tactic to stifle competition. In his findings of fact on
Nov. 5, Jackson echoed the government's accusation.
</P>
<P>
   But antitrust experts say the tying issue could be vulnerable on
appeal, and that an appeals court in a related case last year said
Microsoft should be free to fold browsing software into Windows if
there was a ``plausible claim'' of consumer benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Lessig isn't saying, but antitrust experts expect him to make
the intellectual case for taking software tying seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Code is law'' is the Lessig refrain. In his new book, ``Code
and Other Laws of Cyberspace'' (Basic Books), he suggests that the
technological architecture of software is an appropriate subject
for government scrutiny, though traditional regulation would be
misguided. ``My argument is not for some top-down form of
control,'' he writes. ``My claim is not that regulators should
occupy Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Lessig's views are difficult to dismiss as simply
anti-Microsoft. He gives more weight to the competition Microsoft
faces, for example, than did Jackson, who found that the Linux
operating system was a fringe technology and not likely to
challenge Microsoft anytime soon. ``By 1998,'' Lessig writes, ``it
had become apparent to all that Linux was an important competitor
to the Microsoft operating system.''

   LEARNING TO LIVE WITH YEAR 2000 CONCERNS
</P>
<P>
   Managers and technical experts working on year 2000 computing
projects are becoming increasingly optimistic, despite delays and
program weaknesses that ought to worry them, according to an
informal coalition of year 2000 analysts who have polled such
professionals in June, September and again this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y2K experts remain remarkably optimistic even though many of
them report they are not yet completely ready,'' said Edward
Yardeni, the Deutsche Bank economist who has predicted that year
2000 computer disruptions are likely to lead to a worldwide
recession next year.
</P>
<P>
   The latest poll results, which will be released today, show the
number expecting glitches in their own critical systems edging down
to 33 percent from 34 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 66 percent are confident the power will stay on, up
from 61 percent in September, and 64 percent expect no problems
with phones, up from 59 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
   On the personal front, the more than 1,200 respondents are
slightly less inclined to stock up on food and cash than in
previous polls. And those who are doing so will put aside less than
they had planned in September or June.
</P>
<P>
   But such feelings are a triumph of ``hope and trust'' over
facts, according to Yardeni, who developed the poll with Gary
Beach, publisher of CIO magazine, and the Information Systems Audit
and Control Association, a trade group for professionals working on
quality control in the computer world.
</P>
<P>
   The pollsters said the disquieting responses included the 57
percent saying they were still working on year 2000 problems. In
the September poll, only 43 percent had expected to still be
trouble-shooting by now. And in this most recent poll, only 31
percent were far enough along to have actually tested contingency
plans.
</P>
<P>
   The pollsters also noted that many repair projects had not been
independently tested and that respondents had relied heavily on
unverified assurances of readiness from suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   The poll responses were gathered from Nov. 10-21. The results
are posted at www.peoplepolls.com.

   A SCHWAB MANAGER REVIEWS `Y2K: THE MOVIE'
</P>
<P>
   You had to be generously willing to suspend disbelief to accept
the plot of ``Y2K: The Movie,'' the recent NBC thriller in which
computing's millennium bug leads to industrial apocalypse and
triggers a nuclear meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   But last Monday, the day after the movie aired, a manager at
Charles Schwab &UR;  &LR; &AMP; Co. rushed to calm the gullible.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail memo that day to some 140 employees, Kathy
Childers, a manager involved with Schwab's year 2000 preparedness
effort, assured employees the year 2000 movie ``would not be the
typical scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Although no one knows exactly what will happen, I would like
to set your mind at rest that everything has been done to make
certain that the scenario you saw Sunday will NOT happen,'' Ms.
Childers wrote in her memo.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, the note elicited a few derisive snorts from
the tech-savvy employees at San Francisco-based Charles Schwab, who
said they hadn't necessarily been hunkering down with canned goods
and armaments in anticipation of industrial Armageddon on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Gable, a Schwab spokesman, said that, however Ms. Childers'
warning may have been perceived, she had intended it to have a
tongue-in-cheek tone _ even if the note did go on to discuss some
of the serious efforts Schwab has made to cope with year 2000
issues, like making contingency computer plans.
</P>
<P>
   The message invited employees of Schwab to Ms. Childers' office
to learn more.
</P>
<P>
   It then concluded, ``I would venture to say that if you are
prepared for an earthquake, then you are prepared for Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be small solace, of course, for anyone who has ever
seen the devastation nature wreaked on Los Angeles in the movie
``Earthquake.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cynthia Nixon is only 33, but she has been called a
perennial of the New York theater. It's all right with her, she
says, especially the New York part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always say that at my funeral I want them to play Judy
Garland singing `I Happen to Like New York,''' Ms. Nixon said over
lunch at an Upper West Side restaurant, a block or so from her
apartment and only a little farther from her childhood home.
``Because I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nixon grew up a Broadway baby, making her debut in 1980 as
Blythe Danner's kid sister in ``The Philadelphia Story'' at the
Vivian Beaumont Theater. In the last 19 years she has appeared in
25 plays on and off Broadway. She is starring right now in the
Drama Dept.'s production of ``The Country Club'' at the Greenwich
House Theater. And she has achieved her biggest success as the
corporate lawyer Miranda on the hit HBO comedy series ``Sex and the
City'' _ the city, of course, being New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really great that it's a show about Manhattan,'' Ms.
Nixon said. ``I was born in New York. I've always lived in New
York. I always want to live in New York. It's such a part of who I
am. I always say that New York is my ethnicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nixon, resplendent in a russet brown blouse and pants that
perfectly complemented her short bright-red hair and vibrant blue
eyes, also expresses the proper Manhattanite's attitude toward
fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice that `Sex and the City' is on cable,'' she said,
``so it's not everyone walking down the street that recognizes me.
It's more like three people out of 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nixon is a founding member of the Drama Dept., a highly
praised Off Off Broadway company, and has appeared in five of its
productions, among them ``June Moon'' and ``As Bees in Honey
Drown.'' In ``The Country Club,'' a comedy by Douglas Carter Beane,
the company's artistic director, she portrays Soos, an unhappy
divorcee who returns from California to the place where she grew
up: Wyomissing, Pa., a wealthy, sheltered town of privilege and
ennui. Ben Brantley wrote in The New York Times that Ms. Nixon
``tends to work from the inside out, with an intensity that
suggests she truly feels her characters' pain.''
</P>
<P>
   She may feel that pain as an actress, she said, but as far as
she can see, neither Soos nor Miranda is very much like Cynthia
Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soos is really lost,'' she said. ``She's a victim of her
world's values. The only things she has going for her are her
intelligence and her fairly good sense of irony, but they're not
enough. She thinks that because of her irony she can live in this
insular world and not be victimized by it. But she's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to intimacy, Ms. Nixon said, ``Soos is worried she
won't be good at a relationship, that if she gets too close to
somebody, he'll find out there's nothing there.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``Sex and the City,'' Sarah Jessica Parker, Kristin Davis,
Kim Cattrall and Ms. Nixon portray four New York professionals in
pursuit of relationships; they often seem to have more success
discussing intimate details than achieving intimacy. The show's
second season is in reruns; the third season is to begin in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to men, Miranda has a big chip on her
shoulder,'' Ms. Nixon said. ``She's very confrontational. I think
she's also scared of intimacy. She's had lousy experiences with
men. But she's also looking for reasons for things not to work out.
She's worried that a man will find out how really insecure she is,
no matter how much her accomplishments make her seem impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nixon, on the other hand, has been in a relationship with
one man for 11 years _ Danny Mozes, who teaches English at Lehman
College in the Bronx. They have known each other since junior high
school and went to Hunter College High School together. When Ms.
Nixon went to Barnard College, Mozes attended Columbia, across the
street. They have a 3-year-old daughter, Samantha Mozes. But they
are not married, and Ms. Nixon said they had no plans to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in marriage,'' she said without hesitation.
``There are a lot of reasons. I think it's all about what will help
you, and I don't think marriage would help me. I think it's so
difficult in a relationship to keep trying not to take the other
person for granted, and I think it would just be another step down
the road to taking him for granted. I always say I love him too
much to marry him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nixon was interested in theater even before junior high
school. Her mother, Ann Nixon, studied acting at the Yale Drama
School with Stella Adler and Uta Hagen and started taking her
daughter to the theater at an early age. Her father, Walter Nixon,
was for a time a radio journalist in New York who won awards for a
series of civil rights broadcasts in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother tried acting for a while, but it didn't work out, so
she stopped and decided to have a baby,'' Ms. Nixon said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nixon began auditioning in earnest when she was 12, she
said, ``and I started getting jobs right away.'' There was an
after-school television special, a role in the movie ``Little
Darlings'' with Kristy McNichol and Tatum O'Neal, and then ``The
Philadelphia Story'' at Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, after starting at Barnard, she won roles in two
Broadway plays and performed in them simultaneously, going from one
theater to the other _ as the bright British daughter in ``The Real
Thing'' by Tom Stoppard and as a teen-age Midwestern drifter in
David Rabe's ``Hurlyburly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought of acting as a moneymaking venture,'' she
said. ``I thought I would do commercials and put money away for
college. But I was just not good at commercials. When I entered
Barnard, I tried to figure out what I would do for a career. I was
very pessimistic about being an adult actor. So very few youngsters
make that transition. But then I just kept on working. So I decided
I didn't have to find anything else to do.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nixon has also appeared on television, in regional theaters
coast to coast and in movies, among them ``Marvin's Room'' ``The
Manhattan Project,'' ``Amadeus'' and ``Addams Family Values.'' But
over the years she has always returned to the New York stage.
</P>
<P>
   Her Broadway credits include ``The Heidi Chronicles,'' ``Angels
in America'' and ``Last Night of Ballyhoo.'' In 1995 she won a Tony
nomination as best featured actress as the innocent bookbinder
Madeleine in Jean Cocteau's ``Indiscretions.'' But in recent years
her New York theater focus has been the Drama Dept.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all came about through `The Country Club,''' she said.
``About seven years ago I was performing it at the Dorset Theater
Festival in Vermont. I met Doug Beane, and a while later we did
readings at various theaters in Manhattan trying to get somebody to
do it. But nobody did. Finally, Doug said, `Why don't we start a
theater company?' And I agreed. Because I figured that people say
that all the time and it never happens. But then he did it.''
</P>
<P>
   And the future? Ms. Nixon said she had no real goals. ``I'm not
a goal person,'' she said. ``I expect nothing, and then I'm usually
pleasantly surprised.'' There are some roles she would enjoy.
``It'd be great to do all those fun Shakespeare young ladies,'' she
said. ``But I also look forward to being 50 or 60 and trying to do
a Cleopatra. Or a Martha in `Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'''
</P>
<P>
   Of one thing, though, she is sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope `Sex and the City' runs for 20 years,'' she said.
``Everybody I know keeps saying to me that three years down the
line I may be kind of bored. But I can't imagine it. It's so
exciting to have a character you know and get a new script every
week and find out what's happening to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very big on continuity. I'm not very imaginative. My idea
is more of the same. That's what I feel about my life: just more of
the same.''

`NUTCRACKER': NEW YORK CITY BALLET IN FINE FORM, TO TAPED
TCHAIKOVSKY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``The Nutcracker'' opened on Friday night at the New
York State Theater with the New York City Ballet's bright
performance of George Balanchine's version of the choreographic
fairy tale, which has become a holiday tradition. This year,
however, there was a break in tradition. The New York City Ballet
Orchestra was on strike, and Tchaikovsky's score was heard on tape
for the first time since the production's premiere in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Many ballet companies across the United States regularly use
taped accompaniments, as do some foreign companies visiting New
York. But City Ballet has always been associated with live music. A
company spokeswoman said the ``Nutcracker'' tape had been compiled
from a variety of recordings.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra voted to strike on Tuesday, forcing the
cancellation of a gala. No performances at the State Theater were
scheduled Wednesday and Thursday because of Thanksgiving.
Negotiations over a new contract continued on Friday, without
reaching a settlement. No new talks were scheduled until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Protesting musicians gathered on Lincoln Center Plaza on Friday
night, distributing statements declaring that the ballet company's
management ``flatly rejected our proposal to extend the contract''
while issues were being discussed. A statement by the City Ballet
management made available inside the theater said, ``We had already
offered our musicians a comprehensive compensation package that
would continue their status as one of the highest-paid pit
orchestras in America.''
</P>
<P>
   An announcement taped to the theater's doors informed dancegoers
that if they wished to turn in their tickets, refunds would be
granted. The auditorium appeared to be largely full, with scattered
empty seats.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech before the performance, Peter Martins, the company's
ballet master in chief, said: ``I have the utmost confidence in
what you are about to see, and that these are the greatest dancers
anywhere in the world. They are the best, and they will give you
the best.''
</P>
<P>
   They did. As if aware that the audience craved magic, everyone
danced wholeheartedly. The children in the cast _ students from the
School of American Ballet _ were delightful, including Kara
Buckley, as a sweet Marie; Tyler Gurfein, as a prankish but never
nasty Fritz; and Ezra Hurwitz, who was especially gallant as the
little boy who becomes the Nutcracker.
</P>
<P>
   The grown-ups were in fine form. As the Sugarplum Fairy, Wendy
Whelan looked slightly brittle in her opening solo. But when she
and Damian Woetzel were together in the pas de deux, they offered a
grandly scaled and unusually spacious duet that built to a
brilliant coda. Maria Kowroski was a sparkling Dewdrop. And
Benjamin Millepied and Tom Gold leaped merrily through the Tea and
Candy Cane divertissements.
</P>
<P>
   Robert La Fosse suggests he enjoys portraying Drosselmeier, the
toy maker. Season after season, he experiments with the
interpretative possibilities of the role. One can never predict
what his characterization will be like. On this occasion, his
Drosselmeier was an eccentric old codger, but one who clearly loved
both magic and children. One could imagine him teaching at the
wizards' school in the Harry Potter books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nutcracker'' performances are scheduled through Jan. 2 at the
New York State Theater.

`JACKIE': RECALLING THE CO-FOUNDER OF CAMELOT
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lest the title of Monday night's PBS documentary, ``Jackie:
Behind the Myth,'' leads you to fear you are in for two hours of
digging the dirt, be reassured. This collection of encomiums
couldn't be more respectable and less revealing if it was produced
by a Jacqueline Kennedy fan club, which in a way it is. Relatives,
friends and hangers-on in Camelot (Pierre Salinger, John Kenneth
Galbraith and others) compete or conspire in affectionate
reminiscences about their friend's life and accomplishments, such
as they were.
</P>
<P>
   It begins on a poor-little-rich-girl note. Young Jackie loved to
take care of her horses, but her parents quarreled and divorced,
and she was shuttled between the Auchinclosses and the Bouviers.
Happily, all were well off, and she recovered to become debutante
of the year. There were also boarding school, Vassar, a junior year
in Paris, a job (with the help of her stepfather) as the inquiring
photographer on The Washington Times-Herald and marriage to
``Washington's most eligible bachelor.'' Eight hundred guests
showed up for the wedding and 1,200 for the reception, but her
father was kept away, and as the narrator says in a flight or
descent into romance-magazine prose, ``No one could have guessed
what the bride was enduring.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to sympathize with the bride, a woman of emerging
taste and sensibility, who was thrown suddenly into politics and
pregnancy, but Monday night's gush _ ``Jackie loved being
Caroline's mother,'' the narrator says _ is enough to turn off even
an admirer. And after all that has been written about the Kennedys
and Camelot, it requires either a short memory or an excess of
fascination with the subject to stir up interest in her Oleg
Cassini inaugural gown: ``From this moment on, she knew she would
be part of making history with her husband.''
</P>
<P>
   If Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis deserved the reputation she would
later enjoy in publishing, this script, by Suzanne Bauman, who
calls the books Mrs. Onassis edited ``perhaps the best window of
all into her heart,'' would probably have turned her stomach. Here
Ms. Bauman piles up cliches about Mrs. Kennedy's funeral
arrangements: ``The dreams of a generation were buried that day.
She lit the eternal flame as a message of hope for the future, and
became a symbol of strength herself.''
</P>
<P>
   But enough. The president's young widow, who soon became Mrs.
Aristotle Onassis, seems to have been a private person who found a
way to contribute to the public life. As first ladies go, she was
both stylish and effective, turning her affinity for the arts into
an American asset. She was as much the author of Camelot as her
husband and used her celebrity in behalf of the Kennedy Center,
Grand Central Terminal and other worthy causes. And she met tragedy
in a mature way.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the few frank-seeming quotations in these two hours,
she explains her decision to marry Onassis: ``I just couldn't live
anymore as the Kennedy widow. It was a release, freedom from the
oppressive obsession the world had for me.''
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a private island and a fleet of ships and
planes, she did manage to shield her children from the sort of
publicity that she had had to endure and that, on the evidence of
this tiresome exercise, refuses to stop.

   JUNEAU, Alaska _ The cruise ship industry, once embraced as a
savior for Alaska's lagging economy, has worn out its welcome in
some quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Fed up with giant ships that discharge waste into their pristine
waterways and with tourists who flood their downtown, residents of
Juneau, the state capital, approved a $5 tax on every passenger
last month. A bit farther north, the small town of Haines voted to
limit the number of cruise ships allowed at its dock. And some
Juneau residents have called for one cruise line to be barred from
the state's waters.
</P>
<P>
   But the Alaskans who are fighting to restrict the booming $12
billion cruise ship industry have a powerful opponent they may not
have expected: their own representatives in the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
   At every juncture, efforts to slow the industry's expansion in
Alaska have been blocked by members of the state's three-member
congressional delegation, all of whom are Republicans and chairmen
of committees with wide influence over both the state and the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three years, the Alaska delegation has, among other
actions, opened the way to allowing more ships into the
environmentally delicate waters of Glacier Bay National Park,
stymied federal efforts to consider stricter antipollution
standards for ships, and overridden a state law prohibiting
shipboard gambling in Alaska waters.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the actions were legislative sleights of hand, adding
amendments to bills after public discussion had ended. In some
cases, people here do not even know what their representatives have
done for the industry. Other actions were exercises in political
muscle by an influential Alaska tag team, Sen. Frank Murkowski and
Rep. Don Young, the chairmen, respectively, of the Senate Energy
and Natural Resources Committee and the House Resources Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Murkowski, Young and their spokesmen argue that they are not
protecting the cruise industry but promoting tourism in Alaska,
where the economy has suffered from declines in the timber industry
and a slackening of oil revenue. And many business people
throughout the region have applauded their delegation's efforts as
loudly as environmentalists have condemned them, noting that the
cruise industry has been crucial to the state's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise ship passengers spend more than $160 million a year in
southeast Alaska, according to a 1997 study financed by the
industry and the cities in the region. In Juneau, the influx of
passengers has spawned dozens of businesses, from upscale art
galleries to T-shirt shops, and helped rejuvenate the downtown
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a very positive impact from the cruise ships,''
said Jack Cadigan, whose family owns three shops that cater to
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Dennis Egan of Juneau agreed that the industry's growth
had helped the economy, and he gave part of the credit to the
state's congressional delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are friends of the industry, no question about that,''
said Egan, a Democrat. ``And they have Alaskan issues at heart,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   But the tensions have grown as the foreign-registered cruise
companies have become a major leisure industry, with legislative
protections that are the envy of American business, and as the
Alaska delegation has played an important and little-understood
role in helping to expand the number of ships and passengers
visiting the state.
</P>
<P>
   A look at the fight that has broken out here provides insight
into that role, as well as into how the industry's ever larger
ships, some of them longer than three football fields, are
beginning to stir a backlash in some communities. The struggle also
reflects an age-old feud over Alaska's unrivaled natural resources.
It echoes earlier battles between the timber and oil interests,
which have often bristled at too much Washington meddling, and the
environmentalists, whom some critics portray as uncompromising in
the face of a struggling local economy.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Metcalfe-Helmar, a second-generation Juneau resident
and president of a downtown neighborhood group, was surprised and
pleased by the vote to tax cruise passengers. Just three years ago,
she had led an unsuccessful effort to pass an identical tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been fighting this since the mid-'80s, but it's only
recently that the noise, pollution and dumping have galvanized the
town,'' Ms. Metcalfe-Helmar said.
</P>
<P>
   The tax was approved by nearly 70 percent of the voters. The
margin of victory demonstrated how frustrated many of the people in
this town of 30,000 have become with the 600,000 passengers who
clog their streets each summer, and with the ships whose
smokestacks send a hazy pollution snaking around the mountains that
cradle the town.
</P>
<P>
   But the backlash also reflected deep indignation over the
admission by one company, Royal Caribbean International, that its
ships had dumped hazardous waste within the Inside Passage, whose
clear glacial waters wind gently through southeast Alaska and teem
with salmon, halibut, king crab and whales.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's reaction to the vote was swift. Princess Cruises,
which brought about 180,000 passengers to Juneau last summer, said
its ships would shorten their stays next season, a decision that
created anxiety among local businesses about lost revenue and led
them to form a pro-tourism organization. The company also said it
was canceling the one stop it had planned for next summer in
Haines. Princess' representative here said the moves were intended
to lessen the cruises' impact on the two towns.
</P>
<P>
   Another cruise line took action that some people saw as clearly
punitive. Holland America Line cut off donations to some charitable
and civic organizations in Juneau, including the arts council and
the Civil Air Patrol, and explained that the tax vote had prompted
a ``reassessment'' of its relationship with the city. The local
newspaper, The Juneau Empire, condemned the company for taking
revenge on nonprofit groups.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions may flare again when state regulators hold a public
meeting here, scheduled for this Friday, to consider whether new
restrictions are needed to curtail the activities of cruise ships.
Such restrictions would again put backers at odds with industry
stalwarts in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The cruise industry maintains a low profile in Washington, and
its contributions to candidates for federal office from January
1993 through the end of October 1999 totaled $1.2 million, far less
than those of many other interest groups. But an analysis of
contributions by individuals and political action committees
associated with the industry found that they have been most
generous with the Alaska and Florida delegations, which makes sense
given that the companies have their most important operations in
those states.
</P>
<P>
   The Alaska delegation, whose third member is Sen. Ted Stevens,
chairman of the Appropriations Committee, was the second-largest
recipient of campaign contributions, with $117,950. Only Florida,
which has 25 members in Congress and is also home to most of the
cruise companies, got more: $230,701.
</P>
<P>
   Young was the largest House recipient, with $69,500. Three years
ago he played a pivotal role when a lucrative part of the
industry's business was threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska law limits gambling to charities, which operate
small-scale bingo games and raffles to raise money. In 1993 the
state attorney general determined that the law extended into the
waters the state controlled within three miles of shore and ordered
cruise ships to shut down their casinos.
</P>
<P>
   In most places, the order would not have had much impact,
because cruises quickly escape the three-mile jurisdiction of
American states and operate in international waters, where they are
free of regulation.
</P>
<P>
   But in Alaska the itinerary follows the Inside Passage along the
rugged coast and only several sections along the route, known as
doughnut holes, are more than three miles from either shore. That
made it illegal for the ships to operate highly lucrative casinos
for virtually the entire time they were in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise industry lobbyists persuaded the Legislature to change
the law in 1994, but the governor at the time, Walter Hickel,
vetoed the bill. The next year, the industry won a temporary
exemption for a single season.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated in Juneau, the industry turned to Young, a former
Yukon tugboat captain, asking him to assert federal authority over
gambling within Alaska's waters.
</P>
<P>
   He responded in the fall of 1996 by inserting an amendment into
the Coast Guard authorization bill after public hearings had ended.
The amendment, which applied solely to Alaska, prevented the state
from banning gambling except when ships were docked or within three
miles of a port of call. Young's staff acknowledged that the
amendment was sought by the industry and applied just to the big
ships in southeast Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The change caught state officials by surprise. ``All of a sudden
came this federal law saying they could gamble,'' said Deborah
Vogt, who at the time was the deputy commissioner of the state
revenue department.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Murkowski was undoing plans to allow the National
Park Service to weigh new antipollution standards for cruise ships
in exchange for permitting more vessels to enter Glacier Bay, the
national park and preserve 65 miles northwest of Juneau.
</P>
<P>
   Glacier Bay is a 3.2 million-acre expanse of towering mountains,
deep fjords and forests. It is home to abundant wildlife, including
several species of whales, seals and otters, and its unspoiled
beauty makes it the destination of choice for cruise ships.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Murkowski had pushed to allow more ships into the
bay, arguing that it was the most environmentally sound way for
people to see the park. Park service officials resisted, fearing
that the noise and air pollution would be harmful, especially to
the endangered humpback whales.
</P>
<P>
   After the Republican Party took control of Congress in 1994,
Murkowski became chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources
Committee, which oversees the budget of the Interior Department and
the park service.
</P>
<P>
   At Murkowski's urging, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt directed
the park service to expand cruise ship permits to 184, or two ships
a day, from about 100, during the three-month summer cruise season.
</P>
<P>
   After environmental groups threatened to sue, a compromise was
reached. A slightly slower expansion was approved on the condition
that the park service receive authority to impose higher
antipollution standards if they were found to be warranted by later
studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amazing thing was that we managed to put together a plan
that satisfied just about everybody,'' said Chip Dennerlein, the
Alaska regional director for the National Parks and Conservation
Association.
</P>
<P>
   After the compromise was published in The Federal Register,
however, Murkowski added a last-minute amendment to the 1996 parks
bill that took away the park service's authority to increase
pollution controls.
</P>
<P>
   The change came at the urging of the cruise industry, whose
lobbyists had argued that it was unfair to hold their ships to a
higher standard than other vessels, according to Murkowski's staff
and a former industry lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like the rug was pulled out from under us,'' Dennerlein
said.
</P>
<P>
   The park service was surprised, too. Robert Barbee, the regional
director for Alaska, wrote to the cruise lines in March 1997 that
the change ``effectively negates a key mitigation measure'' and
that it prevented the park service from adopting ``higher planning
and operating standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Murkowski's chief of staff, David Garman, defended the senator's
action, arguing that Glacier Bay could handle two ships a day
without damaging the environment and that the park service should
not establish antipollution standards. Garman also said the senator
would consider tightening laws and regulations if it became clear
that ships were polluting Alaska's waters.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of tightening regulations will be the subject of
the upcoming public meeting in Juneau. The Alaska Department of
Environmental Conservation scheduled the session after concerns
were raised that current laws were no longer sufficient in this age
of megaships.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``These ships are floating cities, really larger than most
cities in Alaska,'' said Michele Brown, commissioner of the
department. ``But unlike cities, they don't need a permit to pump
their waste into the Inside Passage.''
</P>
<P>
   With 3,000 or more passengers and crew members, a big cruise
ship generates an average of 170,000 gallons a day of gray water
from showers, sinks and dishwashers, and 17,000 gallons of black
water, or human waste, according to industry officials.
</P>
<P>
   Under current federal and international laws, ships can
discharge gray water anywhere. Human waste and ground food waste
can be discharged legally anywhere beyond three miles from shore.
</P>
<P>
   The three-mile-limit standard has caused concerns in southeast
Alaska because of the doughnut holes within the Inside Passage.
Though technically international waters, the holes lie within the
passage and adjacent to fertile fishing grounds and feeding areas
for humpback whales. Late last month, The Anchorage Daily News
reported that some ships had discharged waste in the holes.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to the holes on a nautical chart in his Juneau office
earlier this month, Steven Torok, the senior Environmental
Protection Agency official in Alaska, said the law did not take
them into account. ``Three miles offshore was intended to be three
miles offshore, not within the Inside Passage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two independent pilots who help ship captains navigate the
passage said in interviews that they were often asked to take ships
to the areas to pump waste water overboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say it's legal, but nobody's monitoring what's in that
water,'' said Capt. Robert Smith, who has spent 50 years in
Alaska's waters and said he had often been directed to the doughnut
holes. ``We live here and we want to know what they're dumping.''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Ted Kellogg said he sometimes encountered so many ships
discharging in the holes along the eight miles of Chatham Strait
that he was concerned about safety. ``They want to get to the
middle of the strait to dump, and you'll have vessels meeting on
reciprocal courses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Kellogg said most lines, including Celebrity Cruises,
Holland America Line and Princess Cruises, dumped waste into the
holes.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Benson, a spokeswoman for Princess Cruises, said the
company was declining to answer questions because officials thought
previous articles in The New York Times about the industry had been
unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Erik Elvejord, a spokesman for Holland America, said the
company's ships did not discharge waste water into the doughnut
holes and never discharged raw sewage. Instead, he said, the ships
treat their sewage on board and discharge legally permissible gray
water only while traveling between ports so the waste mixes with
the largest amount of outside water possible.
</P>
<P>
   Holland America sends the most ships into Glacier Bay, and
Elvejord said company policy did not allow even gray water to be
discharged within the bay.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Wheatley, senior vice president for safety and environment
at Royal Caribbean, which is also the parent company of Celebrity
Cruises, said Celebrity ships might have used the doughnut holes to
discharge waste on occasion. But, she said, no ships from either
line ever discharge raw sewage within the Inside Passage, and both
lines try to discharge as little gray water as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our company goal is to discharge to the greatest extent
possible outside of 12 nautical miles,'' Ms. Wheatley said.
</P>
<P>
   Since pleading guilty twice in the last 18 months to criminal
charges involving a fleetwide conspiracy to discharge oily waste
water and hazardous material, Royal Caribbean has adopted voluntary
standards to operate above legal requirements for discharges. It
has also begun experimenting with treating gray water before it is
discharged. The company's president, Jack Williams, said at a town
meeting in Juneau last August that he thought the laws governing
discharges should be more stringent.
</P>
<P>
   No ship can store all of its gray water during the average
seven-day cruise through the Inside Passage. As a result, it must
be discharged. Though the lines say their ships do not discharge
gray water while sitting in port and never discharge raw sewage in
the Inside Passage, some regulators are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cruise lines say that they don't discharge raw sewage, but
the issue is that the law allows them to do it and this is a very
competitive industry,'' said Torok of the Environmental Protection
Agency. ``The laws and regulations are outdated.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown, the Alaska environment commissioner, said she would
not hesitate to ask Congress for new laws restricting discharges if
regulators determined that such legislation was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the state of Alaska took the unusual step
Friday of filing a lawsuit in the U.S. Supreme Court claiming
jurisdiction over the waters of southeast Alaska, including Glacier
Bay. The suit argued that the federal Submerged Lands Act gives the
state the right to regulate activities in the waters, including
discharges by cruise ships.

 IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE STILL PLAY CRUCIAL ROLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The presidential primary season this week enters a
frantic two-month sprint to the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire
primary as the contenders deliver their pitches in a blast of
speeches, debates and television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all the activity until February will be concentrated
in those two states, which for years have held outsized influence
in the nomination process.
</P>
<P>
   Many politicians and analysts had predicted that Iowa and New
Hampshire would play less of a role in the 2000 campaign because
several larger states, notably California and New York, had moved
up their primaries so they would gain more influence.
</P>
<P>
   But candidates have not dared to shortchange Iowa or New
Hampshire, though many have continued the custom of tromping
through California to replenish their campaign coffers. If
anything, New Hampshire and Iowa have taken on greater consequence
because of a sense among the campaigns that if they do not survive
those states it will not matter how well they are positioned
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, voters in both states have been besieged with
mailings, television and radio advertisements, and visits by
candidate. Except for a respite over Christmas and New Year's _ and
some candidates plan to break political custom and stump heavily
during the holidays _ the motion is not expected to let up until
the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 24 and the New Hampshire primary eight
days later on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is countdown time, the 24-hour-a-day, seven-days-a-week
campaign,'' said Michael Whouley, Vice President Al Gore's chief
strategist in Iowa and New Hampshire. ``It's only going to get more
intense. You hope at this point that your state organization can
take advantage of opportunities where your guy puts himself in an
advantageous position _ or your opponent makes a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably the best evidence of the fierce competition in New
Hampshire could be found on television on Sunday in, of all places,
Boston, where viewers were swamped with commercials extolling Sen.
John McCain of Arizona as a war hero, George W. Bush as an
accomplished governor of Texas and former Sen. Bill Bradley of New
Jersey as a gifted legislator.
</P>
<P>
   The primary in Massachusetts is not until March 7, but campaigns
are pouring money into Boston television in a drive to reach voters
in southern New Hampshire who watch the Boston stations. While
advertising here is more costly than in Manchester, N.H., it saves
the campaigns that accept federal money from eating up the limit on
how much they can spend in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week, Bradley has pumped by far the most money into
Massachusetts television; the campaign put the figure at $252,000,
plus another $73,600 in New Hampshire. Strategists here said they
had never seen one candidate spend so much on Boston television so
early, and the blitz is not expected to slow anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, viewers again and again were bombarded with a
commercial on Bradley's sponsorship of a law requiring
health-insurance companies to cover at least 48 hours of hospital
care for new mothers. At one point Sunday morning, the commercial
appeared simultaneously on the ABC and NBC affiliates in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is not spending nearly as much now on television but,
unlike Bradley, the vice president has been broadcasting
commercials in Iowa and New Hampshire for five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two months ago everybody was feeling we should walk around
with black armbands and kiss the last presidential candidates
goodbye,'' said Arnie Arnesen, a former Democratic candidate for
governor of New Hampshire who now moderates a radio talk show in
Nashua, N.H. ``Now we're stepping back and saying, `Holy mackerel,
it is real!' We do do something that's important.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican sweepstakes will become fully engaged on
Thursday, when Bush for the first time steps out of his
front-runner's cocoon and takes part in a nationally televised
debate in New Hampshire alongside his rivals. Adding to the
intensity, not to say the drama, is that polls are so tight in New
Hampshire that no one knows who will win the unexpectedly
competitive races on either side.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had dominated the polls in New Hampshire, only to find that
several of his rivals dropped out. That has left him facing a
challenge from McCain, who has come on particularly forcefully in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A CNN/Time poll made public two days ago found that McCain was
supported by 37 percent of those likely to vote in the New
Hampshire primary; Bush was backed by 35 percent. The margin of
sampling error was plus or minus four percentage points
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are so high, and I believe both front-runners have
the potential to put it away with wins here,'' said Tom Rath, a
veteran strategist in New Hampshire who is backing Bush. ``This
primary has never had the importance that this one has.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls in the state also show that Al Gore, who had been
considered the overwhelming early favorite, also faces an
unforeseen and powerful challenge from Bradley. For weeks, Bradley
was ahead of Gore in the polls, but now _ after Gore's almost daily
attacks on Bradley on Medicare and other issues _ the vice
president has climbed back to an even position.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Gore campaign is bracing for Bradley to begin
retaliating _ a move that would bring a more negative tone to the
discourse.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of Bradley and McCain in New Hampshire is particularly
striking because in national surveys Gore and Bush hold towering
leads. It may be because voters in New Hampshire have long prided
themselves on their flinty independence.
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, Bush and Gore continue to dominate, at least in the
early polls. McCain, in fact, is eschewing conventional political
wisdom and bypassing the state to concentrate on New Hampshire.
Even so, Steve Forbes, the publisher, is mounting a disciplined
race against Bush in the state, as is Bradley against Gore.
</P>
<P>
   If either of those candidates scores an upset _ or if McCain
performs unexpectedly well without appearing to be even contesting
the state _ that could seriously affect who has the vaunted
political momentum going in to New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iowa and New Hampshire are perhaps more important than ever
before,'' said Dee Stewart, executive director of the Iowa
Republican Party. Citing the drastically truncated schedule of
contests, he added, ``If a candidate doesn't do well here, there's
not going to be a lot of time after Iowa and New Hampshire to
recover and to be able to put the pieces back together again. The
process is going to be over so quickly.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hackley, the owner of an Internet company who held a
meet-and-greet at his house in Des Moines, Iowa, on Sunday evening
for one of the Republican candidates, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah,
said the pace of campaigning has picked up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably in the next 10 days this is going to be huge,''
Hackley said. ``Everybody's coming here except McCain.'' Noting the
acceleration of commercials, he added, ``I see Bush two or three
times a night.''
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the year, many strategists had expected the
candidates to pay less attention to Iowa and New Hampshire and
spend more time in California, which moved its primary to March 7,
and in other states holding early contests. But most of the
campaigns found they did not have the money to wage national
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians elsewhere have long been envious of the influence of
Iowa and New Hampshire, saying it skews the substantive debate
because candidates tailor their message to voters whose
demographics are not representative of the national electorate. For
example, residents of those states tend to be older than the
national median age; those states also have fewer minorities than
many other states do.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates found that the news media did not appear willing
to bestow new prominence on states that had not been as influential
in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the ones who drive this, and the candidates know they'll
get credit for doing well in Iowa and New Hampshire,'' said Mark
Halperin, the political director for ABC News. ``We can't chase
these guys everywhere, because Iowa and New Hampshire are reliable
historical benchmarks _ we don't know what winning the Ohio primary
really means. It's safe for the candidate and safe for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Strategists spin an assortment of scenarios about what it would
mean to win or lose Iowa and New Hampshire, given the compressed
calendar of contests that will result in most convention delegates
being selected before the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   Many strategists argue that it would be difficult for candidates
who do not win Iowa or New Hampshire to capture their party's
nomination, because the other contests pop up so quickly. ``Even if
the front-runner makes a mistake, there's no time to regroup,''
said David Carney, a longtime Republican strategist in New
Hampshire who is neutral in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Whouley, the Gore aide, put it this way: ``Bradley has to have a
clear knockout early in the process. That's why they're spending
all this money on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even if McCain and Bradley score upsets in New
Hampshire, they could have difficulty capitalizing on their
victories, because of the limited timetable _ and because they lack
the vast national infrastructure of Bush and Gore. On the other
hand, a victory by either of the underdogs in New Hampshire could
lead to nomination battles that would not be settled by the end of
March.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Hauser, a spokesman for the Bradley campaign, sought to
tamp down expectations. ``Given the vice president's assumption
that the nomination was a given, the suggestion now that we have to
score a knockout in the first two states is preposterous,'' he
said. ``Our imperative in Iowa and New Hampshire is to do well
against the many advantages the vice president has.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked then if Bradley had to win Iowa or New Hampshire to
ultimately prevail, Hauser said, ``I don't know the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition is so fluid that strategists are preparing for
almost any eventuality in the 57 days leading up to the Iowa
caucuses. ``Iowa seems to be more stable in terms of the
front-runners,'' said James Carville, a top strategist for Bill
Clinton in 1992. ``But that could change pretty quick. And if Gore
or Bush were to lose Iowa, you'd have a huge story.''

   BORDER-PATROL _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Five years and billions of
dollars after launching the most ambitious attack on illegal
immigration in the nation's history, the U.S. Border Patrol cannot
show any sign that the flow across the U.S.-Mexico border has
slowed. In fact, it appears to have increased despite the agency's
aggressive new strategy. (Harmon, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED

   BORDER-DANGER _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Many illegal immigrants are
losing their lives in the deserts and mountains and cactus scrub
that dominate the border. That was not part of the plan. In April,
a freak snowstorm in the mountains east of San Diego killed eight
immigrants. Throughout the border, ranchers and agents regularly
find bodies, especially during droughts when watering holes and
livestock tanks that sustain illegal immigrants dry up. No one
knows how many bodies lie undiscovered.(Harmon, Austin

   &UR; ALPHA WOLF ON THE JOY OF GROWLING  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The latest Rolling Stone calls the San Francisco Symphony's
 &UR; Michael Tilson Thomas &LR;  ``America's most innovative maestro,''
saying ``he is as well known as a rock star'' in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Upon taking the job in 1995, says the magazine, MTT ``turned a
conservative and slightly fusty orchestra into the most
adventurous, inspiring musical organization in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The conductor praises modern influences _ among them  &UR; Sarah &LR; 
 &UR; Vaughan &LR; ,  &UR; Smokey Robinson &LR; ,  &UR; Sinead O'Connor &LR;  singing  &UR; Prince &LR; 's
``Nothing Compares 2 U'' _ and then provides his favorite metaphor
for the Symphony:
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain orchestras are thought of as athletic teams. But I
like to think about my orchestra as a kind of loving, loyal wolf
pack: When we see one another, we growl. Our musicians happily
growl at one another, because things are good. When the orchestra
plays well, I just lower my head and look at and growl at them. I'm
so proud of them.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. ``S&AMP;M,'' the orchestra's first album with a parental
advisory sticker, was released by Elektra last week. The S refers
to Symphony, the M to Metallica, a group that gets an automatic
warning sticker. The album is a result of the groups' collaboration
last spring at the Berkeley Community Theater.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BEATS ON THE VERGE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kaffe Fassett &LR; , the painter of the exuberant Old Spaghetti
Factory murals recently re-unveiled at Enrico's, was in town last
week promoting his new book, ``Mosaics: Inspiration and Original
Projects for Interiors and Exteriors'' (Taunton; $35). Fassett, who
lives in London nowadays, described his recollection of the milieu
and the year, 1963:
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there, at the end of the B &LR; beatnik era. We were all in
black and talking about existentialism, but I had in my head a
circus playing. When I came in (to see the murals again) and saw
the color, it was joyous and celebratory and thumbing its nose at
all this seriousness.'' With nary a glance to the dark bohemians of
the '60s, the murals seemed to forecast the Summer of Love, said
Fassett, as though to suggest, ``Let's loosen up and enjoy color,
and drape ourselves in Indian bedspreads.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - If you're not stressed enough, contemplate mastering ``The
Complete Idiot's Guide to Power Yoga'' (Macmillan; $18.95), which
aims to ``help individuals gain control over their over-worked,
over-stressed bodies and minds.''
</P>
<P>
   - An emerging problem, as expressed in a press release received
recently, is enough to make one nostalgic for the Stone Age:
``Where can I get Pokemon stuff? The Internet emerges as the only
logical choice.'' Meanwhile,  &UR; Steve Finacom &LR;  overheard a customer
ask Cody's Books in Berkeley, ``Do you sell Pokemon cards here?'' _
an inquiry he likened to ``asking for a Big Mac at Chez Panisse.''
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Barbra Streisand &LR; 's collection of Arts and Crafts furniture
will be auctioned at Christie's today, November 29. The furniture
includes two Gustav Stickley cabinets that will fetch an estimated
$25,000 to $34,000 each. Art &AMP; Auction magazine explainsthis low
price: ``Streisand may have drilled holes in the back to install
stereo equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GIFT IDEA NO. 7 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jeni Paltiel  &LR; is thrilled by the porcelain reproductions of
plastic Pez dispensers available in the Wireless catalog. These $20
gifts are ``as sweet and enjoyable as the vintage originals,'' says
the catalog, and come with a porcelain package of Pez candy.
</P>
<P>
   The porcelain Pez dispenser gives out candy that is not edible
and, warns the catalog, is ``not intended as a toy.''
Metaphysicians may be left pondering its use.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``Do you think (George) Washington was gay?'' A: ``I don't
think anybody is. I mean, I don't even know what the word means.
Sex is a continuum. There is same sex, there is other sex, there is
vegetable sex, there is bestiality. ... And if you have a lot of
energy, you may go through an awful lot of adventures along life's
way.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One night the Long Island family slept in a church.
For two weeks the superintendent of an apartment building put them
up in his storage space, shifting sheetrock and plywood to make
room for all eight: husband, wife and six children, ages 5 to 13.
Later a widow who shared the family's Pentecostal faith let them
bed down on a comforter spread across her linoleum floor.
</P>
<P>
   During eight weeks of such arrangements this fall, people asked
the parents, Jose Torres and Elizabeth Laboy-Santiago, why they
didn't go to a shelter. They explained that Suffolk County's
Department of Social Services had expelled them because of a missed
workfare appointment, incomplete paperwork and other regulation
violations.
</P>
<P>
   Shelter expulsions have become almost routine in Suffolk, which
for four years has strictly applied the rules that Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani intends to enforce in New York City for the first time in
December. Each month, Suffolk County officials say, half a dozen
homeless families are expelled from the shelter motel rooms and
nonprofit agency programs where about 270 families now live.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Nowak, a Suffolk social services spokesman, said families
brought expulsion on themselves, by ignoring the rules and refusing
ample social service help. The regulations, which restrict shelter
to those who meet public assistance requirements, including
workfare, have helped reduce the shelter population by 40 percent
since 1994. While the county does not check what happens to those
expelled, officials say they see no ill effects.
</P>
<P>
   Now, New York City homeless services providers face putting the
regulations into effect for the 5,136 families and 9,096 children
in the city's public shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations make shelter dwellers contribute to the cost of
shelter if they can, to seek and accept permanent housing and to
take other reasonable steps toward independence.
</P>
<P>
   But in practice, county records, state hearing decisions and
interviews illustrate, enforcing the law means some families are
expelled for bureaucratic missteps. Some have been ordered to leave
because they owe small amounts of shelter rent.
</P>
<P>
   And, enforcement sometimes requires families to split up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suffolk County doesn't make up the rules,'' Nowak said. ``we
abide by the regulations set forth by the state and federal
governments.'' He added that staff members make every effort to
help families avoid expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   That was not enough for the Torres-Laboy family, however. On
July 1, Torres was ordered from his family's shelter apartment for
six months for missing a March workfare appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Torres, who brought his family back to Suffolk from Puerto Rico
in 1995 because the youngest child needed heart operations, had two
earlier welfare sanctions. But he also had a long work history,
including landscaping, and had recently started working full time
in a plastics factory for $5.75 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, he said, he slept in his car or the closet of the
shelter apartment. Once, the couple's 13-year-old daughter Xiomarah
recalled, caseworkers dropped by unannounced while he was asleep in
the closet.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Signer, the social work supervisor at the shelter
agency, Suburban Housing Development and Research, confirmed that
the shelter had Torres' wife sign a contract promising not to let
him in at night, or face expulsion. Under the rules, this was
necessary to preserve shelter for the rest of the family, Ms.
Signer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to house the homeless,'' she said, ``not to make
the homeless homeless.''
</P>
<P>
   But in September, Ms. Laboy Santiago was ordered out, too, over
uncompleted housing logs and $443 in overdue shelter rent.
</P>
<P>
   If their mother had nowhere to take the children, officials
warned, child protective services would be notified.
</P>
<P>
   After eight weeks without housing, unable to keep the children
in school and hard pressed to feed them, the parents took the
county up on an earlier offer: one-way plane tickets back to Puerto
Rico, where relatives in a one-bedroom apartment could take the
family in temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't understand the system,'' Torres said.  &QL;

 IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE STILL PLAY CRUCIAL ROLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (CORRECTS ``candidate'' to ``candidates'' in 5th graf)  
(lb) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The presidential primary season this week enters a
frantic two-month sprint to the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire
primary as the contenders deliver their pitches in a blast of
speeches, debates and television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all the activity until February will be concentrated
in those two states, which for years have held outsized influence
in the nomination process.
</P>
<P>
   Many politicians and analysts had predicted that Iowa and New
Hampshire would play less of a role in the 2000 campaign because
several larger states, notably California and New York, had moved
up their primaries so they would gain more influence.
</P>
<P>
   But candidates have not dared to shortchange Iowa or New
Hampshire, though many have continued the custom of tromping
through California to replenish their campaign coffers. If
anything, New Hampshire and Iowa have taken on greater consequence
because of a sense among the campaigns that if they do not survive
those states it will not matter how well they are positioned
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, voters in both states have been besieged with
mailings, television and radio advertisements, and visits by
candidates. Except for a respite over Christmas and New Year's _
and some candidates plan to break political custom and stump
heavily during the holidays _ the motion is not expected to let up
until the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 24 and the New Hampshire primary
eight days later on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is countdown time, the 24-hour-a-day, seven-days-a-week
campaign,'' said Michael Whouley, Vice President Al Gore's chief
strategist in Iowa and New Hampshire. ``It's only going to get more
intense. You hope at this point that your state organization can
take advantage of opportunities where your guy puts himself in an
advantageous position _ or your opponent makes a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably the best evidence of the fierce competition in New
Hampshire could be found on television on Sunday in, of all places,
Boston, where viewers were swamped with commercials extolling Sen.
John McCain of Arizona as a war hero, George W. Bush as an
accomplished governor of Texas and former Sen. Bill Bradley of New
Jersey as a gifted legislator.
</P>
<P>
   The primary in Massachusetts is not until March 7, but campaigns
are pouring money into Boston television in a drive to reach voters
in southern New Hampshire who watch the Boston stations. While
advertising here is more costly than in Manchester, N.H., it saves
the campaigns that accept federal money from eating up the limit on
how much they can spend in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week, Bradley has pumped by far the most money into
Massachusetts television; the campaign put the figure at $252,000,
plus another $73,600 in New Hampshire. Strategists here said they
had never seen one candidate spend so much on Boston television so
early, and the blitz is not expected to slow anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, viewers again and again were bombarded with a
commercial on Bradley's sponsorship of a law requiring
health-insurance companies to cover at least 48 hours of hospital
care for new mothers. At one point Sunday morning, the commercial
appeared simultaneously on the ABC and NBC affiliates in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is not spending nearly as much now on television but,
unlike Bradley, the vice president has been broadcasting
commercials in Iowa and New Hampshire for five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two months ago everybody was feeling we should walk around
with black armbands and kiss the last presidential candidates
goodbye,'' said Arnie Arnesen, a former Democratic candidate for
governor of New Hampshire who now moderates a radio talk show in
Nashua, N.H. ``Now we're stepping back and saying, `Holy mackerel,
it is real!' We do do something that's important.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican sweepstakes will become fully engaged on
Thursday, when Bush for the first time steps out of his
front-runner's cocoon and takes part in a nationally televised
debate in New Hampshire alongside his rivals. Adding to the
intensity, not to say the drama, is that polls are so tight in New
Hampshire that no one knows who will win the unexpectedly
competitive races on either side.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had dominated the polls in New Hampshire, only to find that
several of his rivals dropped out. That has left him facing a
challenge from McCain, who has come on particularly forcefully in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A CNN/Time poll made public two days ago found that McCain was
supported by 37 percent of those likely to vote in the New
Hampshire primary; Bush was backed by 35 percent. The margin of
sampling error was plus or minus four percentage points
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are so high, and I believe both front-runners have
the potential to put it away with wins here,'' said Tom Rath, a
veteran strategist in New Hampshire who is backing Bush. ``This
primary has never had the importance that this one has.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls in the state also show that Al Gore, who had been
considered the overwhelming early favorite, also faces an
unforeseen and powerful challenge from Bradley. For weeks, Bradley
was ahead of Gore in the polls, but now _ after Gore's almost daily
attacks on Bradley on Medicare and other issues _ the vice
president has climbed back to an even position.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Gore campaign is bracing for Bradley to begin
retaliating _ a move that would bring a more negative tone to the
discourse.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of Bradley and McCain in New Hampshire is particularly
striking because in national surveys Gore and Bush hold towering
leads. It may be because voters in New Hampshire have long prided
themselves on their flinty independence.
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, Bush and Gore continue to dominate, at least in the
early polls. McCain, in fact, is eschewing conventional political
wisdom and bypassing the state to concentrate on New Hampshire.
Even so, Steve Forbes, the publisher, is mounting a disciplined
race against Bush in the state, as is Bradley against Gore.
</P>
<P>
   If either of those candidates scores an upset _ or if McCain
performs unexpectedly well without appearing to be even contesting
the state _ that could seriously affect who has the vaunted
political momentum going in to New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iowa and New Hampshire are perhaps more important than ever
before,'' said Dee Stewart, executive director of the Iowa
Republican Party. Citing the drastically truncated schedule of
contests, he added, ``If a candidate doesn't do well here, there's
not going to be a lot of time after Iowa and New Hampshire to
recover and to be able to put the pieces back together again. The
process is going to be over so quickly.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Robert Hackley, the owner of an Internet company who held a
meet-and-greet at his house in Des Moines, Iowa, on Sunday evening
for one of the Republican candidates, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah,
said the pace of campaigning has picked up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably in the next 10 days this is going to be huge,''
Hackley said. ``Everybody's coming here except McCain.'' Noting the
acceleration of commercials, he added, ``I see Bush two or three
times a night.''
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the year, many strategists had expected the
candidates to pay less attention to Iowa and New Hampshire and
spend more time in California, which moved its primary to March 7,
and in other states holding early contests. But most of the
campaigns found they did not have the money to wage national
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians elsewhere have long been envious of the influence of
Iowa and New Hampshire, saying it skews the substantive debate
because candidates tailor their message to voters whose
demographics are not representative of the national electorate. For
example, residents of those states tend to be older than the
national median age; those states also have fewer minorities than
many other states do.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates found that the news media did not appear willing
to bestow new prominence on states that had not been as influential
in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the ones who drive this, and the candidates know they'll
get credit for doing well in Iowa and New Hampshire,'' said Mark
Halperin, the political director for ABC News. ``We can't chase
these guys everywhere, because Iowa and New Hampshire are reliable
historical benchmarks _ we don't know what winning the Ohio primary
really means. It's safe for the candidate and safe for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Strategists spin an assortment of scenarios about what it would
mean to win or lose Iowa and New Hampshire, given the compressed
calendar of contests that will result in most convention delegates
being selected before the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   Many strategists argue that it would be difficult for candidates
who do not win Iowa or New Hampshire to capture their party's
nomination, because the other contests pop up so quickly. ``Even if
the front-runner makes a mistake, there's no time to regroup,''
said David Carney, a longtime Republican strategist in New
Hampshire who is neutral in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Whouley, the Gore aide, put it this way: ``Bradley has to have a
clear knockout early in the process. That's why they're spending
all this money on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even if McCain and Bradley score upsets in New
Hampshire, they could have difficulty capitalizing on their
victories, because of the limited timetable _ and because they lack
the vast national infrastructure of Bush and Gore. On the other
hand, a victory by either of the underdogs in New Hampshire could
lead to nomination battles that would not be settled by the end of
March.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Hauser, a spokesman for the Bradley campaign, sought to
tamp down expectations. ``Given the vice president's assumption
that the nomination was a given, the suggestion now that we have to
score a knockout in the first two states is preposterous,'' he
said. ``Our imperative in Iowa and New Hampshire is to do well
against the many advantages the vice president has.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked then if Bradley had to win Iowa or New Hampshire to
ultimately prevail, Hauser said, ``I don't know the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition is so fluid that strategists are preparing for
almost any eventuality in the 57 days leading up to the Iowa
caucuses. ``Iowa seems to be more stable in terms of the
front-runners,'' said James Carville, a top strategist for Bill
Clinton in 1992. ``But that could change pretty quick. And if Gore
or Bush were to lose Iowa, you'd have a huge story.''

 c.1999 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule book reviews:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``DESERT'' &QL; 
Photos by Jack Dykinga, text by Janice Emily Bowers (Abrams,
$49.50) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This book offers lots of pretty photographs of the Mojave Desert
in which Dykinga seems to concede (appearances on the cover
notwithstanding) that not everything in the rural Southwest is
fluorescent orange. The big draw for us, however, is Janice Emily
Bowers, who lives near Tucson and who has written lovely essays
(``A Full Life in a Small Place'') about the natural wonders there.
Both writer and photographer were assisted by the rains &QL; 
of El Nino during the winter of 1997-1998, which brought the desert
into abundant bloom and made their jobs even more pleasurable than
they'd expected them to be. Tourists came from far away to see the
flowers that spring, many for the first time. Bowers envied them.
``The first time of seeing the desert in bloom is almost painful in
its intensity,'' she writes, ``as if every flower were a needle
piercing your skin or a chunk of ice pressed onto your flesh. I
wanted to join that spring, as if it were a circus, and travel with
it forever.'' She acknowledges that this book might attract more
tourists, which increases her concern over the beautiful,
vulnerable desert. Are the crowds good or bad? ``Sometimes,'' she
writes, ``I don't know which group worries me most: the millions
who visit or the millions who stay away.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``ATLANTIS FOUND'' &QL; 
By Clive Cussler (Putnam, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is what Clive Cussler says about his appeal as a writer:
``I give people what they want. My books are like an old Saturday
afternoon matinee with easily identifiable characters: the big
rugged hero; the shrewd heroine (who is never a bimbo); the nasty
villain who gets it in the end . . . I never mean for it to be
anything more than entertainment.'' His sprawling novel features
his recurring big rugged hero, Dirk Pitt, who is supremely capable
and ever manly but a bit on the stiff side (he's like James Bond
without the panache). His shrewd heroine who isn't a bimbo is Pat
O'Connell, an expert in ancient languages. And the villains? There
are so many, and they fall all over themselves trying to kill
O'Connell and her colleagues and then Pitt, who makes a Bond-like
entrance and rescues them from drowning in flooded tunnels under a
mountain in Colorado. One of the assassins shows up in a ninja suit
and a ski mask, and even though he has a chest wound and is
bleeding from the mouth, he calmly discusses his motives with Pitt
before swallowing a cyanide capsule _ a Saturday matinee touch if
we've ever seen one. The plot here is impossible to describe
because it's more a collection of parts than a cohesive whole.
Among the elements: a comet that crashed into the Earth 9,000 years
ago; a frozen ghost ship discovered near the South Pole in 1858; an
underground chamber with inscriptions on its walls and a black
skull on a pedestal; a Nazi U-boat that attacks Pitt's research
vessel; and a cameo appearance by Cussler himself (a Hitchcockian
tradition that he has added to his novels). We'll let you guess who
triumphs before the final credits roll.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
``WITH WILDER'' &QL; 
By Cameron Crowe (Knopf, $35) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is a wonderful book, not just for film buffs but for those
of us who believe in preserving the stories of people who have had
long and eventful lives. That's an understated description of
director Billy Wilder, of course, but it's the spirit in which this
volume was written. In 1995, Crowe, who had adapted his book ``Fast
Times at Ridgemont High'' for film and had written and directed
``Say Anything,'' approached Wilder and asked the 89-year-old
director to play a bit part in his next movie, ``Jerry Maguire.''
Wilder said no, even when Crowe came back with Tom Cruise, who
turned on the high beams and begged. Crowe wrote about Wilder's
rebuff for ``Rolling Stone.'' Wilder read and liked the story, and
he agreed to an interview with Crowe, a project that expanded to
become this book. In question-and-answer format, Wilder talks about
working with actors (Jack Lemmon, Gary Cooper, Audrey Hepburn,
Marilyn Monroe, Cary Grant, Barbara Stanwyck, Greta Garbo), his
films (``Some Like It Hot,'' ``The Apartment,'' ``Ace in the
Hole,'' ``Sunset Boulevard''), other directors and his big
inspiration, Ernst Lubitsch. There are anecdotes on every page, and
no pretense in sight. The interviews, conducted by Crowe with the
persistence of a journalist and the giddy curiosity of a fan, took
place over more than a year, ending in 1998, when Wilder was 91. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``A PASSION FOR BOOKS'' &QL; 
Edited by Harold Rabinowitz and Rob Kaplan (Times, $27.50) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an essay written in 1981, Anatole Broyard laments the fact
that his friends borrow his books because he has more than most
people, never mind that ``I feel about lending a book the way most
fathers feel about their daughters living with a man out of
wedlock.'' Robertson Davies writes about the idiosyncrasies of book
collecting. Anna Quindlen offers a list of ``The Ten Books One
Would Save in a Fire, If One Could Save Only Ten.'' John Updike
bemoans the gray fluff of book envelopes. Robert Benchley wonders
why no one collects his books (this was in 1934 _ things have
changed). Norman Mailer names his favorite American novels: not one
of them was written by him. This collection is for people who know
what Peter Hamill was talking about when he said this: ``There are
10,000 books in my library, and it will keep growing until I die.
This has exasperated my daughters, amused my friends, and baffled
my accountant. If I had not picked up this habit in the library
long ago, I would have more money in the bank today. I would not be
richer.'' &QL;

SAMPRAS BEATS AGASSI IN SEASON-ENDING ATP FINAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ALAN MAIMON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, Germany _ Pete Sampras wondered aloud whether his
tender back could withstand a five-set match against Andre Agassi
in the final of the ATP World Championship on Sunday. Fortunately
for Sampras, he never had to find out. Sampras routed Agassi, 6-1,
7-5, 6-4, to win the season-ending tournament for the fifth time.
</P>
<P>
   The focus all week had been on the fifth-ranked Sampras, who was
playing in his first tournament since August, and Agassi, the man
who has replaced him at the top of the ranking. Other participants
in the $3.6 million tournament featuring the world's top eight
players had complained that the two Americans were hogging the
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should recognize that this isn't just about Andre and
Pete,'' said Yevgeny Kafelnikov, the No. 2-ranked Russian.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was about Agassi and Sampras, but with a result
that few could have foreseen. Agassi had breezed through the
round-robin matches during the week without dropping a set, scoring
a 6-2, 6-2 victory against Sampras on Wednesday. A bit shaky in his
semifinal victory against Kafelnikov on Saturday, Agassi
nonetheless seemed destined to add the championship title to his
French and U.S. Open crowns.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, however, was out to show that while he would not end
the year No. 1 for the first time since 1992 _ Agassi will keep his
ranking for now _ he was intent on reclaiming the top spot.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras took control of the match from the start, dispelling any
doubts about the condition of his back by lithely tracking down
whatever Agassi could offer up. Sampras dominated the first set
with an impressive combination of power and finesse, alternately
winning points with decisive slams and freezing Agassi in his
tracks with well-placed forehands. Sampras breezed to a 6-1
victory, a love set averted only by a 14-point fourth game in which
Agassi held serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The start against Pete is so important,'' Agassi said. ``After
I started badly, he took chances on his serve that worked.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second set, the crowd of 13,500 tried to rouse Agassi
back to life, giving him the support usually reserved for hometown
players. Agassi came out fighting, serving a love game to open the
set and then breaking Sampras' serve, aided by two double faults.
But the crucial mistakes Agassi had avoided all week surfaced at
the worst possible time. Leading by 4-2, he double-faulted en route
to losing his serve. At 5-5, Sampras broke him again, aided by a
crucial unforced error. Sensing an imminent two-set lead, Sampras
closed out the set with two aces.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, who had 47 winners to Agassi's 14, slammed his 15th ace
to close out the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to see how I was doing physically,'' Sampras said,
his back heavily iced after the match. ``Winning was a bonus. I got
better as the week progressed and saved the best for last.''
</P>
<P>
   So the year ends with Agassi at No. 1 but with Sampras returning
to the form he showed at this year's Wimbledon when he dealt Agassi
a straight-set loss in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big match today and I didn't rise to the occasion,''
Agassi said. ``But it's tough to beat five of the world's eight
best players in six days.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, who will move to No. 3 in the year-end ranking behind
Agassi and Kafelnikov, defeated Agassi in four out of five matches
this year and leads him for their careers, 17-11. After Sunday's
match, he said Agassi deserved the top ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I feel like No. 1?'' asked Sampras, who won $1.4 million
for his victory. ``Not necessarily. You have to look at the year
he's had with winning the French Open, the U.S. Open, and reaching
the finals at Wimbledon. That's pretty significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras believes, however, that he is healthy enough to make a
run for No. 1 next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it sent him a message today,'' Sampras said. ``But I
don't look at it like it's a personal thing with Andre.''
</P>
<P>
   With the last major tournament of 1999 over, attention turned to
future duels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was unhappy with how I played,'' Agassi said. ``But it is
good to see Pete play like this. There's a lot to look forward to
at the Australian Open.''

   WTO-ENVIRONMENT (Seattle) _ The environmental issues at stake
for the WTO. Free-traders say that the best way to encourage

trade, enriching even the poorest nations enough to afford basic
environmental protections. Environmentalists predict a ``race to
the bottom'' in which all eco-friendly regulations are toppled.

   WTO-LOGS (sidebar for WTO-Environment) (Seattle) _ Somewhere
behind the posturing and speechifying of the World Trade
Organization conference this week, the ministers might actually
agree on something: abolishing border taxes on logs, wood products
and paper. Depending on whom you believe, such an agreement could
mean more jobs for U.S. workers, cheaper housing worldwide and
increased environmental protections; or it could mean more
endangered species, fewer jobs for U.S. workers and, in the Third
World, flooding, landslides, hobbled agriculture and ruined
fishing.

   FORT LEWIS, Wash. _ In the small world of senior women officers,
Lois Beard was considered a prime candidate to become the Army's
first General Mom.
</P>
<P>
   She was a veteran of the invasion of Panama and the war in the
Persian Gulf. She commanded a military police battalion that helped
keep the peace in Bosnia. The Army promoted her to colonel's rank
two years ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   On top of her typical 12-hour workday, Col. Beard, 45, was the
mother of three children, raising them with her husband, Glenn,
another Army colonel.
</P>
<P>
   Youthful-looking and energetic, with an officer's unflappable
discipline, she seemed headed toward becoming the first mother
promoted to Army general.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone could do it, Lois could,'' said Col. Stephanie
Hoehne, the spokeswoman for Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO commander.
</P>
<P>
   But then Col. Beard called it quits and retired. After holding
every job and attending every school required to be selected as
general, she decided she could no longer be both a mother and a
commander.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly would have kept going if it wasn't for the
family,'' she said. ``I loved being a commander, but I found myself
saying I would be a better commander if I wasn't a parent and a
better parent if I wasn't a commander.''
</P>
<P>
   Her teen-age daughters had seemed to be withdrawing from her,
she said, and she feared she ``was taking myself out of my
children's lives.'' Rachel, her 16-year-old daughter, said that
while she missed both parents when they were away from home, she
saved her ire for her mother, not her father.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just made me angry when she came home and asked me what I
had been doing,'' Rachel said. ``I wouldn't answer. I'd only say to
myself, `You weren't there when I needed you, so why should I talk
to you now?'''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the subjects that preoccupy women rising through the
ranks, few are more pressing than how to balance motherhood with
the all-consuming commitment required to become a general or an
admiral. If the corporate world has a glass ceiling, women in the
military say the Pentagon has a brass ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing in my whole career that has caused me the
greatest stress and over which I have had the least control is the
care of my children,'' Col. Hoehne said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 37 women are active-duty generals or admirals. The Army
has yet to promote a mother to general. The Navy has promoted three
mothers to admiral, but they are all in the special medical or
support branches. The Air Force has one mother who is a general,
but an official said privacy rules prohibited him from identifying
her.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a quarter century after the military academies first
admitted women, the angst and frustration of raising children is
proving to be a major _ and predominantly female _ obstacle for
women on the road to military success.
</P>
<P>
   When the Army recently asked soldiers why they were leaving the
service, women, regardless of their rank, put time away from their
families as their overriding concern.
</P>
<P>
   Men, on the other hand, were evenly divided among complaints
about their pay, job security, possibilities of advancement and
enjoyment of their work. Separation from their children was not
foremost in their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the unnoticed secret of the military,'' said Charles
Moskos, a military sociologist at Northwestern University. ``Senior
women officers who are mothers are strained beyond the limits.
Whether it is genetic or cultural, women are more bonded to their
children than men. They are caught in a double bind that men in the
military don't recognize, much less understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Col. Nancy Bickford, a 44-year-old Army logistics expert and
mother of two children, was caught in that bind. She passed up
several steps necessary for promotion, because of her family. First
she deferred a battalion command when her husband, who was also in
the Army, was not given an appointment at the same post in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a pretty traumatic experience,'' Col. Bickford said,
``but I wasn't going to abandon my family.''
</P>
<P>
   She was given a second chance and commanded 800 soldiers in a
battalion at Fort Lewis. But then she passed up the Army War
College, again for family reasons. That spelled the end for further
advancement. Next summer she is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very hard to leave the Army,'' Col. Bickford
said. ``It's been a challenging career and you get a huge sense of
accomplishment, but ever since I had kids, I've felt the pull in
the other direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of the 3,628 Army colonels on active duty, only 68, or 1.8
percent, are women on the competitive track to move up to the next
step, which is general officer, according to the Army.
</P>
<P>
   While a Pentagon report released in November showed that the
number of minority and women officers has doubled in the past 20
years, women leave the services earlier than men. Among their
complaints is the sense that women are held to a higher standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of talent is being lost this way,'' said Moskos, who
often consults for the armed services. ``The military shouldn't be
losing these women.''
</P>
<P>
   For women on the intricate obstacle course of promotion,
marriage and pregnancy are barriers to be approached with caution.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Beard married in 1978, when she and her husband led
military police platoons and were heading for new assignments in
Germany. It had been only two years since the Army threw out its
policy requiring pregnant women to leave the service.
</P>
<P>
   After careful consideration, Lois Beard waited until she was
assigned to a professional school in Kansas before becoming
pregnant in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men treat you differently when you're pregnant, asking whether
you really can do those push-ups and whether you should take that
trip,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983 she gave birth to Rachel, and two years later, when she
was in another sedentary job, she gave birth to Megan.
</P>
<P>
   She was worried as much about the Army as about herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can not be in a command position, leading soldiers, when
you are pregnant,'' she said. ``It doesn't work for you or the
soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Defense resists the idea that being a mother
is a disadvantage for a woman climbing to the uppermost levels,
although senior officials acknowledge that women's family choices
can have an effect on their career choices. Except for maternity
leave, official family policy is the same for men and women.
</P>
<P>
   Until she retired, Col. Beard always made the choice in favor of
promotion, even after her son, Ryan, was born in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   She hired nannies. ``At first, with my salary, I could only pay
for the nanny and groceries. Glenn paid the other bills,'' she
said. ``But nannies are a necessity, not a luxury, with the demands
the military puts on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Her normal routine began with physical training at 6:30 in the
morning and ended at 7 at night. In command positions she was on
call 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   She tried to fit the children into her schedule by working what
her daughter called ``crazy hours.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She would work all day, pick us up at school, make dinner and
then go back to work after we were asleep,'' Rachel said. ``She
wasn't here on weekends much.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some women officers have solved that dilemma by leaving their
families behind for years.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Hoehne, the public affairs officer, moved by herself to
Washington for a demanding three-year job at the Pentagon, while
her husband, John, stayed behind with their two children in
Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why uproot them and move everybody so Mom can basically
disappear in her work?'' she asked. ``For me, it was a lonely three
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Col. Hoehne decided not to sacrifice her family life
anymore. After moving to Europe, she dropped a correspondence
course for the Army War College to spend weekends with her
children, throwing away any chance at the top echelon.
</P>
<P>
   Recent Pentagon statistics show that married men and single
women are by far the most likely to make senior ranks of the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason marriage is almost seen as a liability for a
woman, because she will have to spend time with her family,'' said
Lt. Col. Margaret Flott, an Army spokeswoman. ``But I do not think
that is unique to the Army.''
</P>
<P>
   But unlike her civilian counterparts, the military mother
frequently faces overseas deployments.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Col. Lois Beard was sent for four months to Panama. Ten
days after she returned, she was sent to St. Croix, V.I., for two
months. Then in October 1990, she and her husband were ordered to
Saudi Arabia for the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the hardest thing I've ever done in the Army,'' she
said. ``I was 36 years old and didn't know when I would see them
again.''
</P>
<P>
   After putting together all the family photograph albums, Col.
Beard sat down and wrote a 12-page letter to be opened by her
children upon her death. In it she explained that fulfilling her
responsibilities as an Army officer did not mean she placed her
career above her children.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't return, I didn't want them to grow up thinking the
Army was more important to me than they were,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then she and her husband left for nine months.
</P>
<P>
   The three children were sent to live with an aunt. Rachel, then
7 years old, remembers that she ``did not understand what was going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wondered why the three of us had to be without our
parents,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When the family was reunited, Col. Beard tried to make up for
her absence by leading a Girl Scout troop while serving as public
affairs officer to the secretary of the Army. That lasted for a few
years before she and her husband were given battalion commands in
Germany. When the Bosnia peacekeeping operation began in 1995, they
were both ordered into the field and the children were left behind
in Mannheim in the care of a nanny.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a lot harder,'' said Rachel, who was a young teenager
then. ``I really needed my parents around and they weren't there.
It was worse for my sister. She got really quiet when they were
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   After three months, Col. Lois Beard returned to Germany while
her husband remained in Bosnia. At that moment, the Army promoted
her two years ahead of schedule, offering her command of a brigade
with 900 soldiers at Fort Lewis and marking her as an officer on
the fast track.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about the children, Col. Beard spent a long night
debating the promotion with her husband before she decided to
accept the challenge. ``It was gut-wrenching,'' she said, ``but I
decided I had made too much of a commitment to the Army.''
</P>
<P>
   At the top of her game, Col. Beard moved her family here. Her
husband integrated the Officers' Wives Club, forcing a name change
to the Officers' Spouses Club. Her children were happy at school.
</P>
<P>
   And then she discovered she could not do it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three things happened at once,'' she said. ``The job was
all-encompassing, which is why I loved it. The children needed me
more. And I got older. I don't have the resilience I used to have.
I need sleep.''

RUSSIA TO ALLOW CHECHEN CIVILIANS TO FLEE BESIEGED CAPITAL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In a fresh sign that the Russian military plans to
bombard Grozny into submission, the Russian government said Sunday
that it would open a safe passage for desperate civilians to flee
the Chechen capital, which has been under a withering assault for
days.
</P>
<P>
   While Russian officials said the move was intended to reduce
civilian casualties, it also appeared designed to mute Western
criticism that Russia was harming its own citizens in Chechnya more
than the Islamic militants against whom it has been waging a war in
the renegade republic for nine weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It will also give the Russian military an even freer hand to
conduct air and artillery strikes against the city after Russian
authorities conclude that the civilians there have had their chance
to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Since last week, Russian forces have gradually tightened the
noose around Grozny, pummeling the city from the air with fighter
jets as well as on the ground with rockets launched from
helicopters or artillery batteries. The attacks have been the worst
on the Chechen capital since the campaign began, with Grozny's
mayor asserting that at least 260 people had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev has repeatedly said that
his forces have no intention to ``storm'' the city. That pledge is
meant to reassure the Russian public that the military will try to
avoid the sort of deadly street-to-street fighting that resulted in
thousands of Russian casualties during the 1994-96 war in Chechnya,
which ended with the republic's de facto secession.
</P>
<P>
   But such statements do not mean that Russia is not planning to
retake the city. The ferocity of the attacks in recent days has
made clear that the military's strategy is to bludgeon and squeeze
the city into submission. Grozny is a symbol of the Russian
military's humiliation during the 1994-1996 war, and Russia's
generals show every sign of wanting it back.
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of clear skies, the Russian forces stepped up
their attacks on Grozny and the surrounding area Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Nikolai Koshman, the senior Russian
representative to Chechnya, said that Russian aircraft had dropped
leaflets in Grozny telling civilians that a special route has been
set up so that they can safely leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are still people there,'' Koshman told a Russian
television interviewer. ``But it is not a large number, and for
these people a corridor has been left in agreement with federal
forces.''
</P>
<P>
   But the establishment of a humanitarian corridor will not end
the risk civilians face from Russia's grinding military campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how elderly, infirm or wounded civilians still
trapped in the capital will be able to leave. Nor is it clear how
many civilians are holed up in basements and apartment houses
there.
</P>
<P>
   Television pictures from last week show that the streets are
virtually empty, but reports from the region also said that
hundreds of people had streamed out of the city in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, not all of the latest fighting was aimed at Grozny.
Russian artillery pounded Argun, Urus-Martan and several other
Chechen towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
   The news agency Interfax reported Sunday that its correspondent
has seen burnt out cars and tractors along the roads leading from
Urus-Martan, the scene of fierce fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of those strikes seemed to be to destroy Islamic rebels
fleeing Uras-Martin. But desperate civilians are also on the road,
trying to make their way to Ingushetia or, at least, to a Chechen
village that has not became a battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,000 civilians crossed into Ingushetia on Saturday alone,
pushing the total number of refugees there to well over 200,000.
Trucks were lined up at the border, carrying white flags so they
would not be fired at.
</P>
<P>
   Such markings are sometimes not enough. The Russian military
does not have the mandate, training or munitions to wage the sort
of precision warfare NATO conducted in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In late October, a Russian plane bombed a truck bearing the logo
of the Red Cross, according to officials with the International
Committee of the Red Cross. And on at least two occasions, Russian
aircraft appear to have bombed the wrong country: neighboring
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   There have also been several reported cases of friendly fire in
which the Russian military has bombed its own troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not take a genius to understand that if bombs are
dropped on friendly troops every now and then they must be dropping
on civilians much more frequently,'' observed the newspaper
Vechernaya Moskva.
</P>
<P>
   As the Russian military continued its assault, there was little
concern in Moscow about the plight of civilians there.
</P>
<P>
   Every Sunday evening the NTV network, which is owned by the
media mogul Vladimir Gusinsky, and the ORT network, which is
controlled by the tycoon Boris Berezovsky, broadcast lengthy news
interview programs. But neither concentrated on the Chechen war
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russian campaign has drawn mounting criticism from
Western nations, who have complained that Moscow has not taken
proper precautions to minimize civilian deaths.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the
International Monetary Fund, added his voice to the chorus and
suggested that the IMF might suspend its loans to Russia if the
Kremlin continued with its war.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Sergei Stephashin, the former prime minister,
Sunday denounced the IMF for engaging in political blackmail.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the fund's threat to withhold its next $640 million
disbursement will have little affect on the Russians. The Russian
economy has been buoyed by the rise in world oil prices and the
relatively modest disbursement would not have gone into the
government's coffers. It would have been used to pay old Russian
debts to the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   Withholding the money would also mark a shift for the fund,
which gave Russia billions of dollars during the last Chechen war.
But then the IMF's goal was to help President Boris Yeltsin fend
off a challenge by the Communists, not to quell the violence in
Chechnya.

   SHOPPING-ONLINE (Undated) _ The e-tailing rush is under way.
Internet shopping surveys indicate that online holiday spending
started in earnest the 10 days before Thanksgiving. Forecasts call

   JUNEAU, Alaska _ The cruise ship industry, once embraced as a
savior for Alaska's lagging economy, has worn out its welcome in
some quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Fed up with giant ships that discharge waste into their pristine
waterways and with tourists who flood their downtown, residents of
Juneau, the state capital, approved a $5 tax on every passenger
last month. A bit farther north, the small town of Haines voted to
limit the number of cruise ships allowed at its dock. And some
Juneau residents have called for one cruise line to be barred from
the state's waters.
</P>
<P>
   But the Alaskans who are fighting to restrict the booming $12
billion cruise ship industry have a powerful opponent they may not
have expected: their own representatives in the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
   At every juncture, efforts to slow the industry's expansion in
Alaska have been blocked by members of the state's three-member
congressional delegation, all of whom are Republicans and chairmen
of committees with wide influence over both the state and the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three years, the Alaska delegation has, among other
actions, opened the way to allowing more ships into the
environmentally delicate waters of Glacier Bay National Park,
stymied federal efforts to consider stricter antipollution
standards for ships, and overridden a state law prohibiting
shipboard gambling in Alaska waters.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the actions were legislative sleights of hand, adding
amendments to bills after public discussion had ended. In some
cases, people here do not even know what their representatives have
done for the industry. Other actions were exercises in political
muscle by an influential Alaska tag team, Sen. Frank Murkowski and
Rep. Don Young, the chairmen, respectively, of the Senate Energy
and Natural Resources Committee and the House Resources Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Murkowski, Young and their spokesmen argue that they are not
protecting the cruise industry but promoting tourism in Alaska,
where the economy has suffered from declines in the timber industry
and a slackening of oil revenue. And many business people
throughout the region have applauded their delegation's efforts as
loudly as environmentalists have condemned them, noting that the
cruise industry has been crucial to the state's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise ship passengers spend more than $160 million a year in
southeast Alaska, according to a 1997 study financed by the
industry and the cities in the region. In Juneau, the influx of
passengers has spawned dozens of businesses, from upscale art
galleries to T-shirt shops, and helped rejuvenate the downtown
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a very positive impact from the cruise ships,''
said Jack Cadigan, whose family owns three shops that cater to
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Dennis Egan of Juneau agreed that the industry's growth
had helped the economy, and he gave part of the credit to the
state's congressional delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are friends of the industry, no question about that,''
said Egan, a Democrat. ``And they have Alaskan issues at heart,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   But the tensions have grown as the foreign-registered cruise
companies have become a major leisure industry, with legislative
protections that are the envy of American business, and as the
Alaska delegation has played an important and little-understood
role in helping to expand the number of ships and passengers
visiting the state.
</P>
<P>
   A look at the fight that has broken out here provides insight
into that role, as well as into how the industry's ever larger
ships, some of them longer than three football fields, are
beginning to stir a backlash in some communities. The struggle also
reflects an age-old feud over Alaska's unrivaled natural resources.
It echoes earlier battles between the timber and oil interests,
which have often bristled at too much Washington meddling, and the
environmentalists, whom some critics portray as uncompromising in
the face of a struggling local economy.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Metcalfe-Helmar, a second-generation Juneau resident
and president of a downtown neighborhood group, was surprised and
pleased by the vote to tax cruise passenger. Just three years ago,
she had led an unsuccessful effort to pass an identical tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been fighting this since the mid-'80s, but it's only
recently that the noise, pollution and dumping have galvanized the
town,'' Ms. Metcalfe-Helmar said.
</P>
<P>
   The tax was approved by nearly 70 percent of the voters. The
margin of victory demonstrated how frustrated many of the people in
this town of 30,000 have become with the 600,000 passengers who
clog their streets each summer, and with the ships whose
smokestacks send a hazy pollution snaking around the mountains that
cradle the town.
</P>
<P>
   But the backlash also reflected deep indignation over the
admission by one company, Royal Caribbean International, that its
ships had dumped hazardous waste within the Inside Passage, whose
clear glacial waters wind gently through southeast Alaska and teem
with salmon, halibut, king crab and whales.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's reaction to the vote was swift. Princess Cruises,
which brought about 180,000 passengers to Juneau last summer, said
its ships would shorten their stays next season, a decision that
created anxiety among local businesses about lost revenue and led
them to form a pro-tourism organization. The company also said it
was canceling the one stop it had planned for next summer in
Haines. Princess' representative here said the moves were intended
to lessen the cruises' impact on the two towns.
</P>
<P>
   Another cruise line took action that some people saw as clearly
punitive. Holland America Line cut off donations to some charitable
and civic organizations in Juneau, including the arts council and
the Civil Air Patrol, and explained that the tax vote had prompted
a ``reassessment'' of its relationship with the city. The local
newspaper, The Juneau Empire, condemned the company for taking
revenge on nonprofit groups.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions may flare again when state regulators hold a public
meeting here, scheduled for this Friday, to consider whether new
restrictions are needed to curtail the activities of cruise ships.
Such restrictions would again put backers at odds with industry
stalwarts in Congress.

THOSE TOYS ARE LEADERS IN BOX-OFFICE STAMPEDE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD, Calif. _ The movie box-office total for the five-day
Thanksgiving weekend, paced by an astonishing $80.8 million opening
for ``Toy Story 2,'' was strong enough to shatter several records
and confirm Thanksgiving's position as an increasingly important
time to release new films.
</P>
<P>
   In a year that has seen experiments with rapid-editing
techniques and bizarre story lines, the holiday box-office
performance reinforced the idea that familiar characters played by
popular stars and a more mainstream, traditional approach to
storytelling are the things that draw the mass audience to
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly seems that what the audience is out looking for
are very comfortable, familiar kinds of movies,'' Larry Gleason,
president for worldwide distribution for MGM, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Every Sunday, Exhibitor Relations, a company that monitors
box-office performance, releases an estimate of weekend ticket
sales for the 12 top current films, with more complete figures
coming out on Mondays. Sunday's estimate was that this weekend's
top dozen movies would earn $209.9 million in the five days that
began Wednesday, a figure exceeding by 28 percent the Thanksgiving
record of $163.2 million set last year.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of that money came from the weekend's four most popular
films. Behind ``Toy Story 2'' was ``The World Is Not Enough,'' the
19th James Bond adventure, which earned $35 million; ``End of
Days,'' a spiritual thriller in which Arnold Schwarzenegger battles
Satan, which made $31 million; and ``Sleepy Hollow,'' a reimagining
of the Washington Irving tale directed by Tim Burton, which earned
$27.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Bond film and ``Sleepy Hollow'' were in their second
week of release. ``End of Days'' opened on Wednesday. ``Toy Story
2'' went into wide national distribution on Wednesday but had been
playing for a week at the Disney-owned El Capitan Theater in
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically `Toy Story' shattered all predictions, well beyond
what anybody expected,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, chairman of
Exhibitor Relations. ``It's just driving the marketplace right now.
With strong holdovers from `World Is Not Enough' and `Sleepy
Hollow,' and additional boost from `End of Days,' the box office
was just sent into the stratosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Viane, Disney's president for distribution, described the
``Toy Story 2'' opening as ``the most mind-boggling thing that's
ever happened'' and said it was powered by the film's attraction
not only for youngsters and their parents but also for other adults
and a vast teen-age audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the original `Toy Story,' it took two or three weeks for
it to become a movie for everyone,'' Viane said. ``This time they
all came right away. We're seeing 9 p.m., even 10:30 p.m. showings
that are selling out. We all knew we were going to set a record. We
knew that. We could read the numbers. But I don't think we'd ever
have predicted $80 million.''
</P>
<P>
   It marks the sixth year in a row that Disney has had the
highest-grossing film of the Thanksgiving weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2,'' directed by John Lasseter and produced by
Pixar, a computer-generated-animation studio, continues the story
of toys that spring to life when humans aren't watching and
features Tom Hanks as the voice of Woody, a cowboy doll who learns
he's a valuable collectible, and Tim Allen as the voice of Buzz
Lightyear, a formerly deluded space ranger who must save Woody from
an evil collector.
</P>
<P>
   The film drew some of the best reviews of the year. Even so, the
box-office numbers were amazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2'' was playing in 3,236 theaters, the most of any
film this weekend, but still earned $24,969 per theater, compared
with $11,065 per theater for the Bond film and $11,960 per theater
for the Schwarzenegger movie.
</P>
<P>
   If the $80.8 million estimate holds up, it not only will break
the all-time opening for any Thanksgiving film (set last year by
``A Bug's Life,'' also from Disney and Pixar), but it also will be
the third-highest five-day opening for any kind of film at any time
of year, behind ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' at
$105.6 million, and ``Independence Day,'' at $85, both released in
the more lucrative summer season. (``The Lost World,'' Steven
Spielberg's sequel to ``Jurassic Park,'' earned $90.2 million over
a four-day opening weekend in May 1997.)
</P>
<P>
   ``According to our exit research, audiences actually like this
`Toy Story' better than the original one,'' Viane said. ``We
thought we'd have some pretty nice records, but this movie is going
to be around for a long time. We're looking forward to long, long
shelf life.''
</P>
<P>
   Slightly overshadowed by the huge opening of ``Toy Story 2'' was
the continued strong performance of the new James Bond film, which
has earned more than $76 million in its first 10 days of release
and is all but guaranteed to be the most lucrative 007 adventure in
the series' 30-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of the last three Bond movies, the ones starring Pierce
Brosnan, have gotten a little bit better and been able to expand
the audience,'' Gleason said. ``They just seem to be building,
developing new fans each time. And I think we've been successful in
making Bond attractive to a younger and younger audience.''

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

</P>
<P>
   A bit flattened by the juggernaut of the top four films was
``Flawless,'' a drama directed by Joel Schumacher and starring
Robert De Niro about a conservative man's encounters with a drag
queen neighbor. Its national release on Wednesday was much more
limited than the other films, just 478 theaters, and it landed in
12th place for the weekend, earning an estimated $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular interest has been the performance of ``Being John
Malkovich,'' directed by Spike Jonze, an utterly strange story of a
secret portal that leads into the actor John Malkovich's
consciousness. Even though it played this weekend on fewer screens
than the previous weekend, the audience word of mouth was strong
enough to increase its box-office take by 18 percent, up to $2.9
million.
</P>
<P>
   That was the anomaly, though. Mostly, audiences seemed to want
to see the same kinds of films they have wanted throughout the
year, traditional mainstream fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every `Sixth Sense' or `Blair Witch Project' and other
anomalies, there are many more traditional films making up the top
of the box office,'' Dergarabedian said. ``The key to success turns
out to be giving people what they want, which turns out to be the
same thing they've always wanted. They want to be entertained.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Voices and bodies, as tuned and trained, as quick to respond to
commands as any piece of glittering technology, and alive to
impulse, too: This is what gives one hope for a millennium theater
we may bask, even glory, in.
</P>
<P>
   My good spirits began on Sunday, Nov. 14, with a staged reading
of Edward Albee's master play ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf,'' a
one-time-only birthday gala for that once-in-a-lifetime actress,
Uta Hagen. Ms. Hagen was turning 80 and returning to a role she
originated when the play opened in 1961. There was a photograph of
her from that time on the Playbill. Slouched on a sofa, she holds a
full liquor glass in one hand as if about to wave a flag. The other
arm lies boozily at ease. The head is slightly cocked (``I'm too
clever to be just another drunk,'' it says), and the face belongs
to a woman as coarse as she is highhanded.
</P>
<P>
   Gorgeous. The play is a night, a season in hell with two
couples; faculty husbands and wives at a small New England college.
Martha and George are middle-aged and bitter enough to turn every
social occasion into a bout of marital flagellation. Nick and Honey
are young, ambitious and self-conscious enough to still pretend
they're happy together, at least until Martha and George take them
in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Because the actors were seated most of the time, the prose
(elegant, brutish, guarded and hilarious) gave us the sense a book
does, of being alone with a story. But because of the actors'
voices, their concentration, the dynamics of their bodies even
sitting down, we got the emotional shock that only performance
delivers: flesh and blood lives being mangled right there in front
of us.
</P>
<P>
   As the embarrassed, miserable Nick and Honey, Matthew Broderick
and especially Mia Farrow were very good. Ms. Hagen was
astonishing, and so was Jonathan Pryce as George, the husband whose
humiliation becomes desperation and then treachery. The performance
took place in the Majestic Theater, which normally houses ``The
Phantom of the Opera.'' Who needed fussed-over sets and costumes?
For a night at least there was real majesty on that stage.
</P>
<P>
   The next Friday I went down to the Performing Garage in SoHo to
see the Wooster Group's revival of its 1984 piece ``North
Atlantic.'' (It will reopen in January.) The Group, under the
direction of Elizabeth LeCompte, is a fierce, iconoclastic
repertory company. What would it do with ``Virginia Woolf'' one
wonders, for they often take up, take apart then build radical new
models of classics. (``The Three Sisters,'' ``Our Town,'' ``The
Hairy Ape'' and ``The Emperor Jones,'' for instance.)
</P>
<P>
   They also build works from an uncanny layering of nonfiction
texts and performance fantasies. These can be brutal, funny and
sometimes brutally funny. Or do I mean funnily brutal?
</P>
<P>
   ``North Atlantic'' is set in the Reagan 1980s on an aircraft
carrier, so the feel is strictly Evil Empire, 1950s-style. There's
the ``we're in uniform here'' posture, the rat-a-tat talk about
espionage and missions so secret you're not sure you're on them;
the blasts of dirty jokes delivered with tight-jawed manliness or
rancid girlishness; the chain of competition and command among the
men. And the round of gossip, spite, ingratiation and degradation
from the enlisted women that, like the coding machines they type
on, never stops.
</P>
<P>
   Everything gets to near-breaking point while staying in complete
control. It's exhilarating to watch performers who can do this. And
to watch something that's a satire, a hallucination and a musical.
</P>
<P>
   The Wooster Group treats texts like musical scores. It's in the
multiple rhythms of the dialogue, the microphones and tapes that
help create dynamics; all the pitches the actors employ, from the
maniacally fixed voices of the five men (led by Willem Dafoe and
Steve Buscemi) to the women's calculating changes of tone and
texture led by the amazing Kate Valk. Country and western songs
delivered with garish sincerity punctuate the action; the movement
is so intricately paced and proportioned it is a kind of
choreography.
</P>
<P>
   The group's past works have drawn from the McCarthy hearings,
autobiographical monologues and the blackface vaudeville routines
of Pigmeat Markham, all played out amid video screens, industrial
sets and the constant sampling of dance and music styles. (Japanese
Butoh? Viennese waltzes? Jitterbugging or a little pointe work?)
</P>
<P>
   These aren't just more examples of postmodern pastiche. They're
organic to a theater that is about how the internal riot inside us
meets the external riot of language and the chaos of the structures
(social, sexual, theatrical, technological) that confine us.
</P>
<P>
   My weekend ended with a ballet performance at the New Victory
Theater. Having refused to believe that what is first-rate for
children cannot also be first-rate for adults, the New Victory now
refuses to honor the dreary conventional wisdom that divides
audiences into those who prefer ballet and those who prefer
theater. So for 10 days we got to see a group of young dancers from
other companies and countries performing under the tutelage of
Suzanne Farrell, one of the greatest ballet dancers of our time.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone seems to be quoting Yeats right now, and certainly the
lines ``I knew a phoenix in my youth,/So let them have their day''
tend to sum up the feelings of those who saw her dance. But there
is nothing elegiac about her project, ``Suzanne Farrell Stages the
Masters of 20th-Century Ballet.'' Backstage now, coaching and
rehearsing the ballets of George Balanchine, Jerome Robbins and
Maurice Bejart (some created just for her), Ms. Farrell gave fresh
life to classic art and new possibilities to gifted young dancers
and eager, needy audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the excitement came from an individual. In Robbins'
languorous, cheeky ``Afternoon of a Faun,'' the New York City
Ballet dancer Phillip Neal was focused now, thrillingly alive to
what a young body can do in art or love, then subsiding into
Debussy chords as Christina Fagundes left him, sweetly but
inevitably.
</P>
<P>
   A duet from Bejart's ``Romeo and Juliet'' wasn't the greatest
choreography (call it flash-dance ballet), but because Ms. Farrell
taught the dancers, Ben Huys and Veronica Lynn, to give themselves
to its physical and musical logic, real emotion followed. They gave
it dignity, so it gave them grace.
</P>
<P>
   Finally there was Balanchine. Ms. Farrell was his muse for 22
years. The things he used to say, like: ``You cannot dance

music.'' And ``See the music and hear the dancing.'' They are part
of her, body and soul. And we see them in her staging of his
``Divertimento No. 15.'' Mozart's music is meant to lift the
curtain onto a kind of blissful order that is part of daily life.
Balanchine does Mozart the honor of not just partnering him, he
betters him. The ballet is one glorious unfolding phrase with room
for endless rhythms, accents and tonal shadings.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As an outspokenly gay Republican, Richard Tafel is
accustomed to critiques from the left and the right. He recently
wrote a book, ``Party Crasher: A Gay Republican Challenges Politics
as Usual,'' that essentially tries to defend his place on the
political map _ or, as he puts it somewhat more grandly, to answer
the question ``How did a nice guy like me find myself in the
crossfire of American politics?''
</P>
<P>
   Tafel, who is executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans, a
gay political group, writes that he was once compared to an abused
wife who goes back to her husband, again and again.
</P>
<P>
   But Tafel sees his steadfast Republicanism as a matter of
stubborn principle, not pathology. He grew up as one of six
children in Bucks County, Pa., with a set of Republican beliefs.
``It didn't make sense that I should jettison everything that I was
_ my family, my faith, my political principles _ because I was
gay,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was one of those weeks for Tafel. A week ago, the
Republican front-runner in the presidential race, Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas, appeared on the NBC News program ``Meet the Press''
and was asked, in a wide-ranging interview, whether he would meet
with the Log Cabin Republicans. Bush answered, ``Oh, probably
not,'' explaining that ``it creates a huge political scene.'' Tafel
was on his way to church when his cell phone started ringing with
reports of what Bush had said.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, in his office near DuPont Circle, Tafel still
seemed slightly surprised by the whole affair, which struck him as
strangely ``passe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought, what a dumb mistake,'' he said. ``Ten years
ago his father met with gays in the White House. Pat Buchanan
announced he's welcoming gays to support his campaign in the Reform
Party. Jerry Falwell met with gays down in Lynchburg, Va. It's just
not a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are way beyond meetings,'' Tafel insisted.
</P>
<P>
   It is, however, the kind of episode that makes Democrats ask:
Why do gay Republicans stay?
</P>
<P>
   ``Gay Republicans are in the Republican Party primarily because
they agree with most of the Republican agenda _ less government,
free markets, a strong defense, a tradition of individual rights
that has been in debate this whole decade,'' Tafel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the gay Republican says, I would rather change the
Republican Party to make it more inclusive, which will benefit
every gay person in the long run, than flee to the Democratic
Party, get placed under the umbrella of identity politics and then
be put in a position, strategically as a community, where we get
written off by the Republicans and taken for granted by the
Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Tafel, 37, takes the long view. Already, he
says, Republicans are competing for gay voters in many states.
Moreover, he argues, ``It's not like we're asking them to do
something courageous that's going to lose for them.'' Republicans
do better in elections when they are perceived to be tolerant, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And what do gay Republicans want from their party? ``Our goal is
for this to be a neutralized issue,'' he said. Yes, he added, his
members are concerned about issues like adoption and gay marriage,
but he said: ``The short-term goal is to neutralize the rhetoric
and the fear. And when George W. Bush says he can't meet, you know,
there's only one group in the Republican Party that he can't meet
with, we have a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   How did Tafel end up here, living on his party's uneasy fault
line between economic and social conservatism? He intended to
become a minister; he was raised in the American Baptist Church,
and his grandfather and a great-uncle were ministers in the
Swedenborgian church, a small Protestant denomination whose
theology reflects the work of the 18th-century philosopher and
scientist Emmanuel Swedenborg.
</P>
<P>
   Tafel majored in philosophy at East Stroudsburg University in
Pennsylvania, and then went to Harvard Divinity School. He
acknowledged that he was gay after he moved to Cambridge. ``The
word wasn't even mentioned where I grew up,'' he said. He received
his Master of Divinity degree and became an ordained minister, but
was pulled ever deeper into politics, eventually working in the
administration of Gov. William Weld of Massachusetts, the moderate
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The 1992 Republican National Convention in Houston, and in
particular Pat Buchanan's declaration that a ``cultural war'' was
breaking out in America, made Tafel determined to stay and fight in
the Republican Party. For the last six years he has been executive
director of the Log Cabin Republicans, which has its roots in
California and is named for Abraham Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, Tafel said, the Bush flap will build support
among gay Republicans for Sen. John McCain of Arizona, Bush's
rival, who has met with the group. ``Our people are much more
excited about raising money for McCain,'' Tafel said, adding that
his goal is to raise $50,000 for him by the end of the year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A Log Cabin strategy meeting is planned for this week, and in
the meantime, Tafel was making the rounds of the talk shows,
arguing that Bush's move was not only wrong, but bad politics.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Tafel said last week, ``Our battle in the Republican
Party is to make it what it should be _ a party of Lincoln, a party
of inclusion.'' He acknowledged that it was not a job for the
thin-skinned, but, as he put it in his book, ``I didn't get
involved in politics to be liked.''

GOVERNING PARTY CANDIDATE WINS PRESIDENCY IN URUGUAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay _ The candidate of the governing Colorado
Party won the Uruguayan presidency in his fifth try Sunday by
beating back a strong challenge from a leftist coalition that
included Socialists, Communists and former guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Batlle, the governing party candidate, promised in his
campaign to pursue a vigorous foreign policy that would open
markets for Uruguay's dairy and wool products and to improve
educational opportunities by broadly expanding computer and
internet access.
</P>
<P>
   But what caught the attention of analysts throughout Latin
America was the impressive showing by Batlle's challenger, Tabare
Vazquez, the former mayor of Montevideo, the capital. Vazquez, an
oncologist, challenged the free-enterprise policies that are now
fashionable around the region and pledged an aggressive campaign
against poverty.
</P>
<P>
   All four television channels announced at 8:30 p.m. that Battle,
a 72-year-old former senator known for bluntly speaking his mind,
seemed to have won the election based on separate exit polls. With
only minor differences, the polls showed Battle winning 52 percent
of the vote, while Vazquez, 59, won 45 percent. Nevertheless,
Vazquez's Frente Amplio could claim a victory of sorts since it won
the largest bloc of votes in the Uruguayan Congress in the October
31 first-round balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Batlle was able to defeat Vazquez by forming an alliance with
the center-right National Party three weeks ago, so the two
traditional parties that have dominated this tiny country of 3.2
million people for most of the last 150 years will now form a
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   Batlle (pronounced BAH-jay) has been a candidate four times
before, in 1966, 1971, 1989 and 1994, but under a previous system
that combined primary votes with the general election, lost to
other Colorado or opposition candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Batlle is likely to follow the policies of the current
president, Julio Maria Sanguinetti, of seeking out more foreign
investment for the tourism industry and cautiously privatizing some
government services to cut a bloated bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Uruguay is well behind neighboring Argentina and most other
Latin American countries in privatizing industry because its voters
continue their strong support for welfare-state policies that go
back to the presidency of Batlle's granduncle at the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   In a historical twist, it is the Tupamaros, the former
guerrillas, and other left-wing groups that once attacked Uruguay's
social democracy as a liberal trick to subdue the masses that now
most strongly defend the cradle-to-grave welfare state. The
government provides insurance against catastrophic health problems,
operates the electricity system, gas stations and casinos and even
produces whiskey.
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez led in the polls for most of the last year, but
previously undecided voters appeared to be swayed by a Batlle media
blitz in the final weeks of the campaign suggesting that a leftist
victory would mean higher income taxes and economic and political
instability. But Vazquez's strong showing, combined with his
winning a plurality in the first round of voting, has put the two
traditional parties on notice that voters are growing restless with
what is widely perceived as their uncreative leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The Broad Front has become increasingly popular since it was
founded 30 years ago; it won only 18 percent of the national vote
in 1971. After more than a decade of military rule, the alliance
won 21 percent in the 1984 presidential balloting, then 24 percent
in 1989, 30 percent in 1994 and 39 percent in the first-round
presidential vote last month.
</P>
<P>
   A charismatic speaker, Vazquez was able to tap into growing
popular frustration with a recession that has left 11 percent of
the work force unemployed and an economy that shrank this year,
instead of growing.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, as he closed his campaign, Vazquez told a
television interviewer that no matter the results, the left had
won. ``We've reached a quiet revolution, breaking old structures,''
he said. ``The Uruguayan people have transformed us into the first
political force in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   As Battle closed his campaign with a television message to the
country, he said, ``The first thing we need is institutional
stability, next economic stability and finally social stability.''
He added, ``What we don't need is more taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   As Uruguayans voted Sunday, Montevideo's streets were full of
cars flying Uruguayan and party flags. Drivers of competing
caravans honked horns and cheerfully debated with one another from
their car windows in what amounted to a civic fiesta.
</P>
<P>
   At a polling place in the middle-class neighborhood of Pocitos,
Marta Arigoni, a 56-year-old French teacher, said she had voted for
Vazquez because the country ``needs fundamental change'' to improve
public health and education. ``As Jose Artigas once said,'' she
noted, quoting the 19th-century general who fought for independence
from Spain, ``the least favored should be the most privileged.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria del Carmen Saccone, a 57-year-old plastics factory owner,
said she had voted for Battle because the country is doing well.
``The left would take us backward,'' she said, ``and their view of
taking this society in the direction of Cuba doesn't make sense
given how Cuba is functioning.''
</P>
<P>
   Such diverse political opinions heard at the same voting place
is becoming unusual in most Latin American countries, where voters
increasingly vote for centrist candidates and disagree on
personalities more than on policies. But Uruguay remains
surprisingly ideological compared with its neighbors, although
political violence is still exceptionally rare.
</P>
<P>
   Agustin Canzani, a leading political pollster, said on a
television talk show the other night that Uruguay ``is a very
divided country, whoever wins the election,'' adding, ``That's
something we'll have to think about for a long time to come.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After four issues, Tina Brown's Talk magazine is no
longer the talk of the town. After the burst of attention that
accompanied the first issue _ which featured an arguably revealing
profile of the First Lady _ the magazine has hardly stirred a
whisper.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation it has prompted has consisted mostly of the
curious musings of media watchers: Why has the magazine featured
cover stories on Elizabeth Taylor and Farrah Fawcett and Ava
Gardner, movie stars who have been out of the loop _ if not
actually deceased, as in Ms. Gardner's case _ for some time?
</P>
<P>
   This is a critical time for Talk. In a unusual arrangement,
advertisers were required to buy ads in the first four issues or
not at all; now, they are facing the crucial fifth issue. And Ms.
Brown _ the editor who made ``buzz'' and celebrity ``wrangling''
the watchwords of the magazine industry _ is now at the mercy of
the very forces she created, facing a wall of silence. Perhaps this
is an overly harsh judgment to make of a magazine so new, but it is
made on Ms. Brown's own terms. After all, Talk advertisements
promised it would spur ``national debate.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is time for a change. Three key editors have resigned, and
Ms. Brown recently hired Robert B. Wallace, the former editor in
chief of St. Martin's Press, to be editorial director. Oliviero
Toscani, the designer who fashioned Benetton's advertising
campaigns, has signed on to be creative director and retool the
magazine's look.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a deeper question, bound to be raised at a
celebritycentric magazine half-owned by a movie studio: Who is in
control of the editorial mix? Ms. Brown, the editor in chief, or
Harvey Weinstein, the co-chairman of Miramax Films?
</P>
<P>
   The magazine is published in partnership by Hearst Magazines and
Miramax, a division of the Walt Disney company. And, though Miramax
and Disney movies make up only a small portion of the 1999 market
share of the film industry _ 20 percent in terms of revenues
through the month of October, according to The Hollywood Reporter _
about half of the features in Talk by or about people in the movie
industry are about people involved in Miramax or Disney projects.
</P>
<P>
   Of 22 articles in the first four issues written by people in the
film industry or about people or characters in the film industry,
11 featured people recently or currently affiliated with Miramax or
Disney projects.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the first four covers featured an actor or actress who
was in either a Miramax or Disney film in the last year: Gwyneth
Paltrow on the September issue, whom Weinstein refers to as ``the
first lady of Miramax''; Charlize Theron, on the October issue,
appears next month in ``Deception,'' which is produced by Dimension
Films, a Disney unit of which Weinstein is co-chairman; and
Julianne Moore, who starred in the Miramax film ``An Ideal
Husband'' this year, on the November issue.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Williams, who stars in the coming Disney film
``Bicentennial Man,'' appears on the December/January issue, posed
with the robot character from the movie, accompanied by an adoring
profile by Paul Theroux.
</P>
<P>
   Because Weinstein is a true Hollywood schmoozer, one of the few
people in New York who can actually refer to Leonardo DiCaprio as
``Leo'' with a straight face, he is emerging as a player _ a sort
of uber-celebrity wrangler _ at the magazine. It was he who called
Ms. Theron and asked her to appear on the cover of Talk.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Theron, who had a previous agreement with Esquire magazine,
said she would not appear on the cover and wrote a letter to Ms.
Brown asking not to be on the cover, said an executive involved in
the negotiations. But Johnny Depp, who had been promised a cover
spot, was replaced with Ms. Theron, the executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Depp's new movie, ``Sleepy Hollow,'' is released by the
Paramount Pictures unit of Viacom, while Ms. Theron's is a favored
project of Weinstein, Miramax staff members said.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein said that he did call Ms. Theron, but that his
involvement was merely secretarial. ``Tina called me and said, `We
want Charlize. Charlize has a scheduling conflict. Can you help
us?''' he recalled. ``I called Charlize, and she moved something
around. So there was no scheduling conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein said that he was available to Ms. Brown, but that
``Talk is Tina's magazine.'' He added: ``If there's a hot Miramax
movie, I hope they'll cover it. But that's up to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Talk is not the only American magazine part of a
larger corporate structure with an interest in film studios. Two
weeks ago, Time magazine, owned by Time Warner, ran a cover story
about the Pokemon craze, just as ``Pokemon: The First Movie'' was
about to be distributed in the United States by Warner Brothers,
which is also owned by Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   But Talk's situation is different from that of Time, which
depends far less on celebrity faces to sell its product each month.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the large Disney presence in Talk, Ms. Brown says the
magazine is not playing favorites. And she sees nothing wrong with
letting Weinstein run a little interference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes time for a magazine to establish its identity,'' she
said, ``and when you're in the early stages, the first six months
of a product's life, you need all the help you can get. Harvey has
been generous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken time to organize our approach to Hollywood, which
is very much organized around the world of celebrities. I am afraid
I am partly to blame for that because I kind of invented the
concept of the celebrity wrangler and now everybody is wrangling
away.''
</P>
<P>
   But she emphasized that Weinstein was not dictating the
editorial scope of the magazine. ``Harvey is as involved as I want
him to be,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She defended her mix of Disney versus non-Disney celebrities.
About the attention she is giving to the new Miramax movie, ``The
Talented Ripley,'' starring Ms. Paltrow and Matt Damon, Ms. Brown
said that the film ``is very much a Talk audience movie and we
would be cheating our audience if we didn't have stories about
it.'' The current issue of the magazine includes two articles about
the movie, which is distributed and produced by Miramax in
partnership with other film companies, and another article is
scheduled for the February issue.
</P>
<P>
   But what of Elizabeth Hurley, the actress who appears in an
other-worldly fashion shoot in the December/January issue? Ms.
Hurley appeared in a Disney movie, ``My Favorite Martian,''
released earlier this year. No mention of that was made in her
fashion spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea she was in a Martian movie,'' Ms. Brown said,
adding that she did not find out Ms. Hurley was in ``My Favorite
Martian'' until the magazine was going to press.
</P>
<P>
   After four issues, Ms. Brown said she now planned to pull back a
bit and devote more time to running the entire Talk enterprise,
which also includes a book and fledgling Internet division.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should not be absorbed in reading six drafts of an article,
which is what I have been doing, which has been my dilemma,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown said that she was working out the significant initial
problems of the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw the success of the first issue, it was a crazy,
wonderful thing, but I knew our staff was too small,'' she said,
adding that she had expanded the staff.
</P>
<P>
   She said that she would consider changing the paper quality of
the magazine, which is now printed on thin paper that does not
reproduce photographs well. ``Pocket Fashion,'' a feature at the
front of the magazine that showcases high-priced fashion items and
services, like $700 boots and $200 pedicures, will go.
</P>
<P>
   She added that the magazine needed to break more news.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's about bringing in more enterprising writers, not
just chasing down stories that are already out there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That will be Wallace's job. Formerly a producer for ABC News and
editor at Rolling Stone magazine as well as a book editor, Wallace
said he planned to bring more investigative pieces to the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make news and break news and that means looking for
stories with a lot of journalistic calories,'' he said. ``I have
been around long enough to take the long view on a story.''
</P>
<P>
   From a business perspective, the formula may be working _ for
now. Because Ronald A. Galotti, the magazine's publisher, required
that advertisers sign on for the first four issues, the magazine is
enjoying a steady stream of advertising revenue. Galotti said that
advertising revenue for the first four issues was $19 million. By
contrast, advertising revenue for Esquire's 12 issues in 1998 was
an estimated $42 million, for Details $31 million, and for Vanity
Fair $109 million. If Talk kept up its pace for all 10 of its first
year's issues, ad revenue for the first year would be $47.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Galotti said that the first issue sold extremely well on
newsstands but conceded that subsequent issues had sold far fewer
copies. Still, he said that newsstand sales would average 247,000
copies an issue for the first six months and that he would promise
advertisers a circulation rate base of 650,000 in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Jordan, the president of Circulation Specialists Inc.,
said that according to figures from New York newsstand wholesalers,
the first issue sold 100,000 copies on newsstands in New York, and
about half that for the second issue. He had no figures for the
third or fourth issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are very good numbers for New York, which is one of the
key markets for newsstand sales,'' Jordan said. ``A lot of other
fairly major national magazines put out fewer magazines than Talk
has actually sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Galotti said that he would have 300,000 subscribers in hand by
February, though there is no way to verify that number or to figure
how much is being spent to get each subscriber.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers remain cautiously optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Doyle, the managing director for media at Lowe, Lintas &AMP;
Partners, said: ``The early indications are that they
overdelivering their rate base significantly. From what we can
tell, in the early stages, it's an affluent educated audience. But
the big question is, is there continued consumer interest? If we
see that consumer interest continues to be as strong as Ron says,
then the advertising support will certainly be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein's view? Business is booming. He said: ``Count the
pages, please, and call the advertisers. Ron Galotti wouldn't give
a discount to his grandmother.'' &QL;

PROTESTERS COULD STEAL THE SHOW AT SEATTLE TRADE TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS to change number of countries in WTO from 134 to 135 in 2nd
graf.) 
(mk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ There will be hundreds of protesters in sea-turtle
costumes and stilt walkers dressed as monarch butterflies.
Thousands of people will tie up the downtown during a giant
demonstration, and protesters will chain themselves to buildings or
scale walls to unfurl banners denouncing the target of their ire:
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   In what is shaping up as one of the biggest protest efforts in
years, people from more than 500 organizations have poured into
Seattle. They accuse the 135-nation, Geneva-based world trade body,
which is holding its ministerial meeting here this week, of
favoring free trade at the expense of the environment, consumer
safety and workers' rights.
</P>
<P>
   The protest groups range from the well-known, like Friends of
the Earth and the Humane Society, to the obscure, like the Ruckus
Society and Raging Grannies.
</P>
<P>
   Several, including the Sierra Club and the United Steelworkers
of America, are planning a Seattle Tea Party on Monday with the
slogan ``No Globalization Without Representation.'' Imitating their
Boston forebears, the protesters plan to throw steel imported from
China into the sea as well as some shrimp, hormone-treated beef and
other goods they view as tainted by the trade body's decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The WTO responds to the needs and interests of the very rich
and corporations, but it doesn't respond to the needs of the
environment, labor, the poor, women or indigenous people,'' said
Alli Starr, a dancer in the radical group, Art and Revolution, who
flew in from San Francisco to protest and do street theater.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing a page from Vietnam War protests, the trade
organization's critics have scheduled a weeklong cavalcade of
activities, including teach-ins, concerts, people's tribunals for
corporations and appearances by sympathetic members of Congress.
Like the 1968 Democratic Party convention in Chicago, the trade
meeting has become a magnet for all manner of protest.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, hundreds of protesters plan to form a human
chain around Seattle's exhibition center to demand that wealthy
nations cancel the debt owed by the world's poor nations. The
biggest event will be a protest march on Tuesday sponsored by the
AFL-CIO, which wants the trade body to allow trade sanctions
against countries that violate core labor standards, like
prohibitions against child labor.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the groups hope to pressure the trade body to change its
ways, while others want to disrupt it, with the ultimate goal of
destroying it. In 1919, Seattle endured one of the nation's first
general strikes, but it has never experienced protests with people
from so many different groups _ labor unions, farm groups,
environmental groups _ and so many countries, including Canada,
France, Panama and India.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, trade ministers' meetings attracted only a
handful of protesters, who were largely seen as cranks, but the
protests have mushroomed and include many mainstream groups. The
protests have been fueled by the Internet, anxiety about
globalization and anger with World Trade Organization rulings.
</P>
<P>
   In the most-criticized ruling, the United States was found to
have acted illegally in barring imported shrimp caught by fishing
fleets whose nets do not contain devices allowing sea turtles to
escape. The protesters also oppose a ruling that an American
requirement for a smog-fighting gasoline additive was an unfair
trade barrier, and another that concluded that Europe had no
scientific basis for barring hormone-treated beef from the United
States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people are upset with the WTO because of the
expansiveness of its limits on government health and safety
actions,'' said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen's Global
Trade Watch, a Ralph Nader group. With 20 organizers here, that has
been the main coordinator of the protests. ``The WTO has managed to
gore everyone's ox. Its track record has been that every single
environmental or health policy it has reviewed has been found to be
an illegal trade barrier.''
</P>
<P>
   The ministers gathered here plan intense, closed-doors talks to
decide what specific areas of trade should be included in a
multiyear round of negotiations aimed at reducing trade barriers.
In contrast, many protesters hope to make their protests as visible
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the meeting has become Ground Zero for anyone with
a beef about the world economy. There are protesters against the
growing gap between rich and poor, against genetically engineered
products, against despoiling rain forests and against America's
economic and political dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be using a carnival festival model to oppose the
WTO,'' said Brooke Lehman, a New York-based protester active in a
group called No to WTO. ``Everybody is coming together to protest
the WTO and the corporate-dictated government it represents. We
regard the WTO as an undemocratic, illegitimate power.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixty groups in a coalition called the Turning Point Project are
spending more than $100,000 on full-page advertisements attacking
the trade body, saying that expanded agricultural trade is hurting
small farmers in dozens of countries and causing more pollution and
energy use.
</P>
<P>
   The Geneva-based trade body's defenders say globalization and
expanded trade are vital for making poor countries wealthier, and
some proponents suggest that many protesters want to stop economic
progress altogether. They also say it aims to promote free trade by
overturning various countries' laws or regulations that
discriminate against trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   With so many protesters crowding into Seattle, police officials
here say they fear some violence. But many protest leaders say they
fear that violence would detract from their message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm scared that if one anarchist throws a brick through a
store window downtown, that will become the big story, and our
whole critique of the WTO is going to get lost,'' said Michael
Dolan, Public Citizen's main coordinator of the protests.

   LOS ANGELES _ As the year 2000 approaches, here's a look at some
of the interesting anniversaries that will occur this week in Los
Angeles sports history (followed by the ranking of the event from
the book ``Unforgettable: The 100 Greatest Moments in Los Angeles
Sports History'' in parenthesis, where applicable):
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 30, 1974: USC 55, Notre Dame 24 is the final score. And the
Irish led 24-6 at halftime. Senior tailback Anthony Davis returns

with him running into a Kingdome tunnel. !ital!(93)
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 1, 1988: The Kings' Bernie Nicholls sets a team record for
points in a game _ eight _ with two goals and six assists against
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 2, 1972: USC's Davis, then a sophomore, single-handedly
takes apart Notre Dame with a six-touchdown effort, two of them on
kickoff returns of 97 and 96 yards, to highlight a 45-23 win before
75,243 at the Coliseum. !ital!(32)
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 3, 1948: UCLA defeats Santa Barbara College 43-37 in the
first game _ and first of 767 wins _ for head basketball coach John

<P>
   Dec. 3, 1966: Lew Alcindor scores 56 points and grabs 21
rebounds in UCLA's 105-90 victory over USC.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 4, 1987: Lakers center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had scored in
double-figures for 787 straight regular-season games over 10 years

</P>
<P>
   Dec. 5, 1973: The Angels make a deal with the Chicago Cubs for
All-Star third baseman Ron Santo _ but he vetoes it. Santo is the

 &HT;    Hurricane season known for big miss, little hit
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The 1999 hurricane season, which ends
Tuesday, will be remembered for Floyd, the big one that got away,
and Irene, the little one that didn't; for a late season hurricane
that reminded us to be wary into November; and for an ominous
first: five storms of Category 4 or higher in one year _
miraculously, none coming ashore at that strength.
</P>
<P>
   The five storms that killed people _ none stronger than Category
2 on the Saffir-Simpson scale when they made landfall _ may have
been responsible for the deaths of nearly 500 people.
</P>
<P>
   After bracing for Hurricane Floyd, which threatened to be the
most powerful hurricane strike on Palm Beach County and the
Treasure Coast since the great 1928 storm, people were caught off
guard when Irene slipped up the peninsula and drenched South
Florida on Oct. 15 and 16.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Irene brought gusts as high as 92 mph to the
Glades, but never brought hurricane-force winds across the
mainland. Still, its rains _ Boynton Beach alone experienced nearly
16 inches in two days _ brought flooding that took days to
dissipate. Winds and flooding caused at least $200 million in
insured damages.
</P>
<P>
   Irene killed seven people in South Florida, all in Broward
County. A mother, her two sons and a neighbor boy were electrocuted
in Weston in calf-deep water when they stepped into a puddle
containing a downed power line while walking their dog during a
lull in the storm. A 13-year-old Cooper City boy died when he
grabbed a downed power line as he waded through 18 inches of water
during the storm. And two people drowned after driving into canals
next to flooded roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irene is a reminder that October is a busy month,'' National
Hurricane Center forecaster Richard Pasch said last week. ``Florida
gets a lot of hurricane hits in October; we saw it frequently in
the 1930s and 1940s. That's a reality check.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd was larger than life as it bore down on the Florida
peninsula Sept. 12, with top sustained winds of 155 _ about the
same strength as Andrew. Florida's salvation was a giant trough
that forecasters said would begin steering Floyd away from shore
about 24 hours ahead of projected landfall, which at the time
looked more and more like downtown West Palm Beach. The storm did
turn on time that night, but not before nerve-wracked residents
boarded up and chewed fingernails. Procrastinators fighting for
plywood caused turmoil at home improvement stores.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd later straddled the coast through the Carolinas to New
England, bringing catastrophic flooding to North Carolina and New
Jersey and killing at least 69 people _ the largest U.S. loss of
life since Agnes in 1972. Early damage estimates were at least $3
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Another storm, Dennis, had come ashore in the Carolinas on Aug.
30 and gone out to sea, but returned and savaged the North Carolina
coast for a week, bringing heavy rains, gale force winds and
flooding. Seven people died.
</P>
<P>
   As is often the case, the deadliest storm wasn't the strongest
or the wettest. It wasn't even a tropical storm. A tropical
depression formed off Mexico's Yucatan peninsula Oct. 4 and came
ashore northeast of the coastal resort of Veracruz; that weather
system and another one next to it brought torrential rains that
caused flooding and mud slides that may have killed as many as 400.
</P>
<P>
   Just as people were starting to take down their shutters, Lenny
sprang to life in mid-November, racing from the Gulf of Mexico east
through the Caribbean. It killed 13 people in the Virgin and
Leeward Islands before fizzling on Sunday, only nine days before
the official end of hurricane season.

`THE ILIAD': TROJAN WAR VICTIMS LIE ON NORMANDY BEACHES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By D.J.R. BRUCKNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ War is hideous glory in Homer, elevating combatants
to achievements that astound them, terrifying them with death and
abandonment among the shades below and debasing them with runaway
lusts. And the performance of ``The Iliad: Book I'' by the Aquila
Theater Company, the first mixed British-American company approved
by Actors Equity, at Lincoln Center draws an audience so deep
inside the great poem that one seems to experience what Homer's
heroes did.
</P>
<P>
   Seven actors and the director, Robert Richmond, conceive it in
terms of the Normandy invasion during World War II. With no props
but combat gear and four metal boxes the size of steamer trunks
they create Olympus, a storm-tossed armada, altars in temple
sanctuaries, and the beaches before Troy strewn with corpses and
wrecked ships.
</P>
<P>
   If the contemporary idiom of Stanley Lombardo's new translation
is off the streets and out of barracks, the company's choreographed
movement, the chants, the occasional dances and the rhythms of the
speeches convey much of the feeling of the Greek verse: its rumbles
and melodies and silences, the beat of its pulse.
</P>
<P>
   The Normandy metaphor is thrillingly embodied. Of course, the
Greeks and the Allies came ashore in much the same way: here under
the roar of aircraft suggested by Anthony Cochrane's musical
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Later, enthralled by an argument between Achilles and Agamemnon
over rejecting a ransom offered by a priest of Apollo for his
daughter, we might forget Normandy. But Apollo in vengeance flings
his whole quiver of arrows at the Greeks, and they soar over us
into the soldiers' hearts with the same sound.
</P>
<P>
   Further on, as Odysseus and his men row a fleet of penitential
offerings out to Apollo's priest in the harbor, we see they are
manning the LSTs of 1944. And at the end, when Zeus, to humiliate
Agamemnon on behalf of Achilles, turns the war against the Greeks,
they fall in bursts of machine-gun fire. The fit of the wars is
perfect.
</P>
<P>
   The depth and emotion of the epic become palpable throughout.
The anger of opposing leaders in war councils _ their own passions
are more lethal to them than the Trojans _ is mean and degrading as
they fight for booty, but they argue at the heart of moral
philosophy, over trust, equity, justice, truth, compassion, mercy.
</P>
<P>
   Humor is irrepressible. A groveling appeal by the crippled god
Hephaestus to his mother, Hera, is high comedy, and a scrap between
Zeus and Hera over what he has promised Achilles' mother, the low
form. (``Me? Pry? I never pry!'') Is this too earthy? Well, it is
not nearly as low-down as Homer's own reflection, in a later book
of this epic, that watching the backs of Hera and Aphrodite as they
stroll on Olympus put him in mind of two pigeons waddling down the
pavement.
</P>
<P>
   At the end Zeus sends a dream to Agamemnon, wearing a gas mask
and speaking in a voice with an echo, and when Agamemnon falls for
the dream's message, the Greeks are hurled to their fates as
Achilles, disappearing from the light of the battleground, says,
``Fight or not, we all die,'' and then shouts, as all others die,
``I won't lift a finger in this bloody war.''
</P>
<P>
   The ensemble precision, sensitivity and unity of Aquila is as
exciting to experience as this fine dramatization is. The actors
can move as with one set of hands and feet and speak with one voice
(or, in the case of the dream, two, in perfect syncopation).
</P>
<P>
   A few days before the performance I saw, Peter Hilton, the
Achilles for this American tour, had an emergency appendectomy, and
Cochrane, playing King Lear in the other play in this repertory,
stepped in as the Greek warrior, as naturally as if he were in fact
Homer's hero and not acting at all.

   Stock Market's Success May Hinder Future Rally
</P>
<P>
   With about a month left in the millennium, the three main stock
gauges are poised to record annual returns of more than 10 percent
each for the fifth consecutive year _ an unprecedented streak. But
the wealth generated by those gains may also pose the biggest
threat to a repeat performance in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   If the gauges keep rising, some economists argue, the stock
market will continue to fuel consumer spending, which could prompt
the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates. Higher
rates could spook equity investors if they conclude that the
economy and earnings growth will finally slow significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Music TV Shows May Have Peaked
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiasm for music-based television miniseries is starting
to cool, largely because the most ambitious music project this fall
was undone by ABC's rampaging _ and inexpensive _ ``Who Wants to Be
a Millionaire'' game show. CBS promoted ``Shake, Rattle and Roll,''
a fictionalized journey through the early rock 'n' roll years,
heavily, and scheduled it on the first Sunday in November. But
``Millionaire'' pushed the miniseries to a poor first-hour rating,
and the show never recovered. CBS has no music-based movie projects
on its development slate, although NBC has ``The '70s'' ready for
May. And it may commission a film on the '50s rocker Little
Richard.
</P>
<P>
   The Architect of a Wireless Empire
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Gent, the chief executive of Vodafone AirTouch, has
moved with dizzying speed to fulfill his vision of a company that
would operate the world's largest wireless network, positioning it
smartly for the future. But his hostile offer for Mannesmann was
rejected by the company's supervisory board.
</P>
<P>
   Online Ad Crowd for Super Bowl
</P>
<P>
   The scramble by Internet companies to increase recognition of
their brand names by advertising in traditional media outlets will
accelerate on Super Sunday. Dot-coms are paying record prices _ an
estimated average of more than $2 million for each 30-second
commercial during the Super Bowl, which is at least 25 percent
higher than the 1999 rate.
</P>

   Hanson of Britain Bids for Pioneer
</P>
<P>
   Hanson, the British building-materials producer, said that it
had offered to buy Pioneer International of Australia for $2.51
billion to strengthen its global position.

<P>
   Dispute Over Customized Music
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of Web sites are offering customized music
programming. What the listeners are not hearing is a
behind-the-scenes dispute between the sites and record labels over
how much these sites should reimburse record labels each time they
play recordings owned by the labels.
</P>
<P>
   Fallout From `Y2K: The Movie'
</P>
<P>
   After the broadcast of ``Y2K: The Movie,'' in which computing's
millennium glitch leads to industrial apocalypse and sets off a
nuclear meltdown, a manager at Charles Schwab in San Francisco
rushed to calm the gullible. In an e-mail memo to employees, a
manager involved with Schwab's Year 2000 preparedness effort
assured employees that the Year 2000 movie ``would not be the
typical scenario.'' Needless to say, the note elicited a few
derisive snorts from the technology-savvy employees.
</P>
<P>
   Cities Take Sides in Soft-Drink War
</P>
<P>
   To raise money, nearly a dozen cities have sold the exclusive
rights to soft-drink sales on their property to Coca-Cola or
PepsiCo. In addition to eliminating competition, the soft-drink
companies hope the access will allow them to build customer loyalty
and create a sense of goodwill in the community.

quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams. ...The Times's computer model collapses
runaway scores and takes note of a home-field advantage. Recent
games count more than earlier games. ...The top team is assigned a
rating of 1.000; the ratings of all other teams are percentages
reflecting their strength relative to the top team. This week, for

 A HUMAN TOLL WHEN HOMELESS SHELTERS GET TOUGH 
 (jw) 
 By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One night the Long Island family slept in a church.
For two weeks the superintendent of an apartment building put them
up in his storage space, shifting sheetrock and plywood to make
room for all eight: husband, wife and six children, ages 5 to 13.
Later a widow who shared the family's Pentecostal faith let them
bed down on a comforter spread across her linoleum floor.
</P>
<P>
   During eight weeks of such arrangements this fall, people asked
the parents, Jose Torres and Elizabeth Laboy-Santiago, why they
didn't go to a shelter. They explained that Suffolk County's
Department of Social Services had expelled them because of a missed
workfare appointment, incomplete paperwork and other regulation
violations.
</P>
<P>
   Shelter expulsions have become almost routine in Suffolk, which
for four years has strictly applied the rules that Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani intends to enforce in New York City for the first time in
December. Each month, Suffolk County officials say, half a dozen
homeless families are expelled from the shelter motel rooms and
nonprofit agency programs where about 270 families now live.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Nowak, a Suffolk social services spokesman, said families
brought expulsion on themselves, by ignoring the rules and refusing
ample social service help. The regulations, which restrict shelter
to those who meet public assistance requirements, including
workfare, have helped reduce the shelter population by 40 percent
since 1994. While the county does not check what happens to those
expelled, officials say they see no ill effects.
</P>
<P>
   Now, New York City homeless services providers face putting the
regulations into effect for the 5,136 families and 9,096 children
in the city's public shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations make shelter dwellers contribute to the cost of
shelter if they can, to seek and accept permanent housing and to
take other reasonable steps toward independence.
</P>
<P>
   But in practice, county records, state hearing decisions and
interviews illustrate, enforcing the law means some families are
expelled for bureaucratic missteps. Some have been ordered to leave
because they owe small amounts of shelter rent.
</P>
<P>
   And, enforcement sometimes requires families to split up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suffolk County doesn't make up the rules,'' Nowak said. ``we
abide by the regulations set forth by the state and federal
governments.'' He added that staff members make every effort to
help families avoid expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   That was not enough for the Torres-Laboy family, however. On
July 1, Torres was ordered from his family's shelter apartment for
six months for missing a March workfare appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Torres, who brought his family back to Suffolk from Puerto Rico
in 1995 because the youngest child needed heart operations, had two
earlier welfare sanctions. But he also had a long work history,
including landscaping, and had recently started working full time
in a plastics factory for $5.75 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, he said, he slept in his car or the closet of the
shelter apartment. Once, the couple's 13-year-old daughter Xiomarah
recalled, caseworkers dropped by unannounced while he was asleep in
the closet.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Signer, the social work supervisor at the shelter
agency, Suburban Housing Development and Research, confirmed that
the shelter had Torres' wife sign a contract promising not to let
him in at night, or face expulsion. Under the rules, this was
necessary to preserve shelter for the rest of the family, Ms.
Signer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to house the homeless,'' she said, ``not to make
the homeless homeless.''
</P>
<P>
   But in September, Ms. Laboy Santiago was ordered out, too, over
uncompleted housing logs and $443 in overdue shelter rent.
</P>
<P>
   If their mother had nowhere to take the children, officials
warned, child protective services would be notified.
</P>
<P>
   After eight weeks without housing, unable to keep the children
in school and hard pressed to feed them, the parents took the
county up on an earlier offer: one-way plane tickets back to Puerto
Rico, where relatives in a one-bedroom apartment could take the
family in temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't understand the system,'' Torres said.  &QL;

DOMAIN IDENTITIES ERODE AS GROUPS CROSS DOT-SUFFIX LINES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID F. GALLAGHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It used to be that you could tell a lot about a Web site just by
looking at the letters after the ``dot'' in its address. But as
competition for prime Internet addresses intensifies, the most
popular dot suffixes for domain names _ .com, .net and .org _ are
losing the meanings they once had.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, .com was designated for businesses, while .net was
for groups or companies involved in network access to the Internet
and .org was associated with nonprofit organizations. But not
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since about two or three years ago, there is no distinction
between .com, .net and .org,'' said Christopher Clough, a spokesman
for Network Solutions, the largest Internet name registrar. ``It's
all up to the registrant and self-selection.''
</P>
<P>
   And now that the business of registering names has been opened
to competition, other registrars are all too happy to ignore the
informal rules to keep customers satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, companies wanting a snappy Web address that may no
longer be available in the popular .com category are pushing into
.org and .net territory. In other cases, major companies have
registered across the board to protect trademarks, and nonprofit
organizations, politicians and government agencies are going for
the cachet and easy recall of a .com address.
</P>
<P>
   Until last summer, when it lost its government-sanctioned
monopoly on .com, .net and .org registrations, Network Solutions
made most decisions about who should get which address. Clough said
that in the past the company informally reviewed new domain
registrations to verify that they were appropriate for a particular
category. But in 1995, as new registrations increased, he said, it
became clear that the screening practice was slowing down the
registration process too much. So the company stopped checking.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Network Solutions encourages customers to register multiple
names to cover all three suffixes. ``Anyone may register Web
addresses in .com, .net, and .org,'' says the help section of the
company's Web site (www.networksolutions.com). ``In fact, the best
way to protect the uniqueness of your online identity and brands is
to register or reserve Web addresses in all of the top-level
domains.'' It may also be the best way for Network Solutions to
make money because it charges $35 a year for each name.
</P>
<P>
   This blurring of the lines can be confusing because Web surfers
often rely on suffixes for clues to the nature and source of a Web
site. The prospect of an unscrupulous commercial enterprise posing
as a nonprofit fund-raiser by using the .org domain, for example,
worries some experts _ even if there is no evidence yet of such
hoaxes.
</P>
<P>
   Michael M. Roberts, interim president and chief executive of
Icann _ the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers,
the network's new governing body _ said the notion that .com, .net
and .org were now all the same was ``not a universally popular
view.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When Network Solutions started giving people names without
asking any of the old questions, things just got very muddy,''
Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies, especially larger ones, have followed Network
Solutions' advice by covering all the domain-name bases. The
Coca-Cola Co., for example, has registered cocacola.org, coke.org
and coke.net _ all of which send surfers to Coke's home page,
www.coke.com.
</P>
<P>
   And many registrants who might have fit better into another
category have chosen .com addresses. A growing number of political
campaigns are taking this option, on the assumption that .com is a
better-known designation than the .org suffix that presidential
candidates used in the 1996 campaign. This year, many have selected
.com addresses, which they are promoting in their print and
broadcast advertising. The list includes georgewbush.com,
mccain2000.com, algore2000.com and billbradley.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on all the advertising that Yahoo and Amazon and
everyone else has done, .com has permeated the culture in a way
that .org has not,'' Lynn Reid, an Internet political strategist
who is a senior adviser to Bill Bradley's campaign, said.
</P>
<P>
   But with some .com addresses having sold for more than $1
million, and with nearly six million .com names already taken, some
businesses are opting for .net or .org addresses.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And a small Internet consulting firm outside Chicago was
confident enough in its choice of .org to make the address part of
its name: the Sitebuilder.org Co. Christopher Bickford, director of
technical services for Sitebuilder.org, said the company was
formerly called ZY Solutions. Then an employee stumbled across the
name sitebuilder.com, which is used by a German company, and
learned that the sitebuilder.org address was available.
</P>
<P>
   Bickford said some of the company's executives opposed the name
because of its nonprofit connotations. ``But the marketing guys and
the sales guys said, `Hey, Sitebuilder! People know what a site
builder is,''' Bickford said.
</P>
<P>
   And he said customers generally did not have problems with the
name. ``We don't represent ourselves as anything but a for-profit
company,'' Bickford said.
</P>
<P>
   The last few years, Joseph Butcher of Seattle has registered a
number of generic-sounding .org and .net names, including
books.org, auction.net, travel.org and computers.org, which he said
he planned to use for either nonprofit or commercial ventures.
Already he has set up a Web site called surplus.net, which is run
as a nonprofit trade association for companies in the
surplus-materials business, which share marketing costs and a
central Web directory. He makes his money by operating the site and
charging the members for services like the designing of Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Using any of his .org names in this way would be ``reasonably
true'' to the perception that .org is for nonprofits, he said. But
Butcher, who described himself as ``an old Net guy from way back,''
said he would no longer be opposed to using .org names for strictly
commercial sites.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone likes the direction the trend is flowing.
Richard Forman, president and chief executive of Register.com, one
of the new registrars of domain names, said that most people still
assume that .org denotes a nonprofit. That is why he contends that
a company using a .org address ``is misleading the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Network Solutions Web site, Register.com suggests
registering a name across the three main domains. But the site's
help pages also list the ``basic rules'' for the various suffixes,
noting for example that .org is recommended for not-for-profit
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Though use of .com, .net and .org is now a free-for-all, the
registration of addresses with some other suffixes is still tightly
controlled. Some countries, for example, are strict about handing
out addresses bearing their two-letter country codes. In Japan, for
instance, an organization or company can register only one .jp
name.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, .mil is reserved for the military, .gov is
for federal government sites and .edu is for colleges and
universities and other schools. But that has not stopped government
agencies and branches of the military from getting .com addresses
for sites intended to attract the public. Workers at the U.S.
Postal Service have e-mail addresses ending in usps.gov. But the
Postal Service promotes usps.com as its Web address and sells
stamps at Stampsonline.com.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And the Army has a recruiting site at goarmy.com. Gary Bishop,
Web administrator for the Army Recruiting Command in Fort Knox,
Ky., said the address, which appears in broadcast and print
advertising, was chosen by an advertising agency. ``The .com gave
it more of an advertising flavor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Icann, the Internet governing body, plans early next year to
discuss proposals for new domains, like .firm and .arts, Roberts,
the group's president, said. One question will be whether to keep
the new categories closed, forcing applicants to meet certain
qualifications. But Roberts said it was unlikely that there would
be a move to enforce or encourage any such rules for existing
domains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The horse has gone from the barn on .com, .net and .org,''
Roberts said.

   LOS ANGELES _ Did you know that Al Davis' claim to owning NFL
territorial rights to Los Angeles is just one big fraudulent
contradiction, aside from the fact he has a lease with Oakland that
runs through 2011 and most likely won't be able to weasle out of
it?
</P>
<P>
   Or the reason the family of an auto racer who dies during an
event, such as Greg Moore's death at the Marlboro 500 CART race
last month in Fontana, usually can't sue the track for liability is
because an implied doctrine of assumption of risk serves as a
defense, even if it can be shown track officials or another driver
was at fault?
</P>
<P>
   Or that you can't start a Web site with a URL like
www.LADodgers.com because of the Lanham Act, a general trademark
law that many courts are using to interpret cases against
cybersquatters?
</P>
<P>
   As legal issues in sports push their way more to the forefront,
interpreting their impact becomes more essential, and a site
maintained since July by a Fordham School of Business professor in
sports law tries to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark's Sportslaw News'' site (www.sportslawnews.com) is
actually an extension of the class taught by Mark Conrad to
graduate and undergrads at the New York university, updated each
Monday with analysis of the sports law issues he finds most
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think sports fans and students have become aware of legal
issues in sports to a far greater degree than in the past,'' Conrad
said. ``As the business has become larger, more lucrative and more
a part of U.S.'s and other nations' societies, the legal issues are
hard to ignore.''
</P>
<P>
   The focus on the site this week, for example, is more fallout
from Title IX _ a group of male students at the University of
Miami-Ohio are suing the school, claiming certain men's sports were
eliminated to make way for more varsity teams.
</P>
<P>
   All of Conrad's essays are archived on the site, as is an update
glossary of legal buzzwords, articles and a search engine. His wife
is the designer and web consultant, which cuts down on any
financial burden Conrad might otherwise incur from a full-time Web
master.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be Mr. Sports Law in cyberspace, and my site to be
the first place to go for everyone interested in sports and law,''
Conrad said.
</P>
<P>
   __The 100th renewal of the Army-Navy football game has spawned a
site (army-navy100.com) generated by TotalSports.net that will have
what they call ``TotalCast'' Internet coverage of Saturday's
contest from Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is plenty of historical information, trivia,
schedule of events this week and an auction center.

<P>
   HARGEISA, Somalia _ ``I'm a crazy old woman,'' Edna Aden Ismail
said only a minute or two after introducing herself. ``You might as
well know that from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   If that must be one's fate, one might as well do it as Ms.
Ismail has. She looks wonderful, to begin with: a queenly woman of
62, beautiful in her gold Ghanaian gown and head wrap.
</P>
<P>
   She clearly tries to be humble, but still the superlatives of
her life spill out. First woman in Somalia with Western nursing
training. First woman in Somalia with a driver's license. First
woman of Somalia, period, because she was the first wife of
Mohammed Ibrahim Egal, prime minister of Somalia from 1967 to 1969.
</P>
<P>
   (She shows off some photos of President Lyndon Johnson, in a
tuxedo, towering over all 5 feet 2 inches of her at a White House
dinner. ``Oh, he was great fun,'' Ms. Ismail said.)
</P>
<P>
   She broke a lot more ground in Somalia, and at the moment she is
vying for a new title, noble but frustrating: first woman _ no,
first person _ in Somalia to build a maternity hospital for poor
women, using her own money and not getting much help.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital is going up in a place most people in the world
would avoid: in the poorest part of Hargeisa, a big city in what
some people see as the former Somalia, a place with no central
government and one of the highest rates of infant mortality.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital site itself was once a military training ground
under the sometimes-socialist rule of Mohammed Siad Barre. He
overthrew Egal in 1969 and remained in power until 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone had a very strong urge to quote Marx, Lenin or
Engels, this is where you did it,'' she said. ``And if, after you
were done saluting, you had an urge to kill someone, this is where
you did it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, she says, she has poured about $300,000
of her savings into the ``monster,'' as she calls it: 31,500 square
feet of raw concrete, which she hopes will someday become the
hospital's birthing rooms, surgical theater, library.
</P>
<P>
   She is, by Somali standards, a rich woman: a British-trained
maternity nurse, she had a long career in the United Nations and
retired two years ago as the World Health Organization's
representative in Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
   But her money is running out. And finishing the hospital is
turning out to be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans of Ms. Ismail say that the problems of her hospital
are likely symbols for the problems of the place where it located:
in the self-proclaimed Republic of Somaliland, which declared
independence from the rest of Somalia in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Egal now leads Somaliland, and they are still friends. ``We've
both matured,'' said Ms. Ismail, now widowed by the death of her
third husband.
</P>
<P>
   Somaliland has accomplished much since then _ peace and the very
first stirrings of prosperity _ even though it receives little
international help, largely because it has not been recognized by
any outside powers as a nation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ismail has managed to raise her hospital three stories high,
receiving from international groups, she says, only four
wheelbarrows, three buckets, four picks and a wheelchair from
Greece, still in bubble wrap.
</P>
<P>
   Somaliland has been trying to convince international aid
programs that it needs help to build on what it has accomplished.
In the case of her hospital, Ms. Ismail says, she could finish the
job in only a few months if she had $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   But neither Ms. Ismail nor her potential nation seems likely to
get much help soon. Ms. Ismail believes the reasons are similar in
both cases: ``They are suspicious of Somalis,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of ``donor fatigue'' _ a drop in aid money when the
donors feel that little is being accomplished _ gained currency
after the United Nations fled Somalia in 1994 after trying to help
people suffering from civil war and famine, but leaving the nation
no closer to stability.
</P>
<P>
   Many outside nations, including Somalia's neighbors, also hope
Somalia may reunite, and no one wants to help Somaliland too much
until that happens or the dream dies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody who comes to Hargeisa visits my hospital,'' Ms.
Ismail said. ``They come. They cry. They go.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are giving us lip service. People coming here shed tears
but when it comes to help, it doesn't come.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Romanus N.S. Mkerenga, the local UNICEF representative, said
it was nothing personal, at least as far as his agency was
concerned. His agency is likely to donate equipment and even put
the hospital under contract to provide medical services once it is
finished, he said, but it has no funds for construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not our mandate,'' he said. ``We don't do buildings in
any of our projects.''
</P>
<P>
   Another U.N. official said there was some doubt about the
project itself: that it was simply too ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ismail would not dispute the ambitious part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an ambitious old woman,'' she said as she tromped around
the construction site on a recent afternoon.

</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the word ``crazy'' slips out to describe the vision of
her hospital.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted at first to open only a hospital for mothers and
babies, which might have meant a modest, one-story building.
</P>
<P>
   But there are few nurses in Somaliland. So she decided she would
have to open a school in the hospital to train nurses.
</P>
<P>
   That means teachers. Teachers mean classrooms and books.
Teachers and student nurses need a place to live, so that means
dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   And when her own money runs out, the place will still need
money. So that means the small cluster of shops she is building
around the hospital's periphery, which will pay rent.
</P>
<P>
   To save more money, she is building herself an apartment in the
hospital _ with a view of Hargeisa, including the deranged man who
lives in a rusted truck cab a few empty lots over.
</P>
<P>
   With help or not, she is determined to finish the hospital
sooner than later. Ms. Ismail, who delivered her first baby in
1960, wants to be spry enough to teach. She seems determined to do
it, too, with a measure of humor, evident in at least every other
sentence of her perfectly idiomatic English.
</P>
<P>
   She likes, for instance, the word: ``Bingo.'' As in: ``Bingo! My
1992 P.C.!,'' pulling back a dust cover to reveal a dinosaur of a
computer with a cracked screen, donated by a friend. Or: ``Bingo!
They are making bread! We have light!'' to explain that the only
electricity the hospital has at the moment comes, erratically, from
the bakery down the street.
</P>
<P>
   She may, too, be the first woman in Somalia to boss around so
many men _ the masons and other builders, who take a pledge not to
fight or chew khat, a mildly narcotic leaf popular in Somalia,
while working for her. She has, by necessity, also become an expert
in the male-dominated art of construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned so much,'' she said. ``In my next reincarnation,
I think I will become a mason.''

PALESTINIANS ARREST SIGNERS OF ATTACK ON ARAFAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Palestinian Authority arrested seven prominent
Palestinians on Sunday after they signed a statement accusing
Yasser Arafat's administration of ``tyranny and corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the strongest crackdown by the Palestinians to date on
peaceful dissent.
</P>
<P>
   The protest statement, distributed on Saturday, was signed by 20
influential academics and political leaders, including nine members
of the Palestinian Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alarm bells should sound in every village, town and refugee
camp, and in every corner, shop, home and office,'' they wrote.
``Our homeland is being sold out, and our people are being
betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us join together to confront this tyranny and
corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Though accusations of corruption are often aired in opposition
circles, the statement was notable for the prestige of the signers,
who include several legislators for Arafat's own Fatah political
faction.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual direct attack on Arafat himself was even more
striking. They accused him of ``opening the door to opportunists
who are spreading corruption throughout Palestinian society.''
</P>
<P>
   In raids beginning at midnight and continuing through midday
Sunday, Palestinian security agents in Nablus and Ramallah seized
five of the signers: two doctors, a writer, an economist and a
university professor. The professor's computer and some of his
personal papers were confiscated, associates said.
</P>
<P>
   Two others were placed under house arrest, including Bassam
Shakaa, a popular former mayor of Nablus.
</P>
<P>
   The government ``was surprised by this statement, because it was
the most direct statement yet of its kind,'' said Abdel-Jawad
Saleh, one of the legislators who signed the document. ``They have
been trying to keep these feelings quiet through intimidation, and
this statement knocked those barriers down. By their actions today,
they are trying to put those barriers back up.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not known whether further arrests were contemplated. The
nine legislators are legally protected against prosecution, but
they were told privately Sunday that Arafat may ask the council to
strip them of their immunity.
</P>
<P>
   No formal charges have yet been filed, but Palestinian security
officials acknowledged that the arrests were an effort to squelch
public criticism of the Arafat government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is very dangerous these days,'' said one
security official. ``We are in the middle of final status
negotiations. This is not the right time to demand accountability.
There are other ways for constructive criticism, in the parliament
and in other institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   A Palestinian human rights organization, LAW, condemned the
arrests as ``a grave violation of the right to freedom of
expression'' and called for the immediate release of the five
arrested men. ``The illegal measures taken are not based on any
warrants issued by court,'' the group said in a statement Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Temporary detention without charges is permitted under
Palestinian law, however, legal analysts noted. The arrest order
was reportedly issued by Ghazi Jabali, the Gaza-based Palestinian
police chief and a close Arafat confidant. He refused to comment on
Sunday's action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider these arrests to be political, and we demand their
release,'' said Hasam Khrasheh, a Palestinian legislator who also
signed the statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be happy to face trial, so that the judiciary could
take a decision without political interference,'' Khrasheh said,
referring to the lawmakers who signed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In its statement, the group also voiced frustration with
Palestinian economic stagnation and the slow pace of peace talks
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinian leadership said after Oslo that the agreement
with Israel would create a state with Jerusalem as its capital,
bring back refugees to their homeland, dismantle settlements,
release prisoners and lay the economic foundation for us to become
the Singapore of the region,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, after six years of Oslo, more land has been stolen, the
settlements have expanded, there are back-room deals over the cause
of the refugees, and Palestinian jails are locking their doors on
our sons. And we don't have Jerusalem, and we are not Singapore.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was the direct accusation of corruption that was viewed
as the trigger for Sunday's punitive action. Legislators complain
that as much as a fifth of the government's revenues do not appear
in the budgets that they are asked to pass into law, and Western
government donors to the Palestinians have echoed those concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is money that the president is taking, and nobody knows
how it is being spent,'' Saleh asserted Sunday, referring to
Arafat.

ADVERTISING COLUMN: SUPER BOWL IS ATTRACTING A CROWD OF NEW
COMPETITORS
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: In E(asterisk)Trade, sub the typographical symbol, which
cannot be transmitted to some newspapers.) 
(nk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Beethoven were commissioned to rewrite his Fifth Symphony for
Super Bowl XXXIV, he would undoubtedly begin this way: ``Dot, dot,
dot, com. Dot, dot, dot, com.''
</P>
<P>
   The mad scramble by Internet companies to increase recognition
of their brand names by advertising in traditional media outlets
will accelerate on Super Sunday, typically the biggest day of the
year for Madison Avenue. Dot-coms are paying record prices _ an
estimated average of more than $2 million for each 30-second
commercial during the game, which is at least 25 percent higher
than the 1999 rate _ to elbow their way into the ranks of mainstay
Super Bowl advertisers like automobiles, beers, credit cards and
soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, a dot-com, the E(asterisk)Trade Group, will
even sponsor the halftime show, until now the province of purveyors
of prosaic products like lunch meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dot-coms need to generate awareness and attention, to
introduce themselves to the public, to get noticed by Wall
Street,'' said Joe Mandese, editor of The Myers Report, a media
industry newsletter. ``What better way to do that than the ultimate
advertising event?''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the big gamble by the dot-coms that the exposure
gained during the game on Jan. 30 will be worth the expense could
be proved wrong. If the performance of their pitches is deemed
sufficiently weak, what was intended as a shrewd business move
could backfire badly. Not only might those dot-coms not be back for
Super Bowl XXXV, they might not be in business by then either.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a major-league shakeout,'' said Gene
DeWitt, president and chief executive at DeWitt Media in New York,
which buys commercial time and ad space for advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all seem to have decided it's live or die, spending gobs
of money,'' he added. ``There's a kind of desperation to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the estimated 30 companies buying commercial time during the
game, which will be broadcast by ABC, a dozen or so will be
dot-coms. That is four times as many as last year. In fact, that is
more than have appeared during all previous Super Bowls combined.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated 125 million American viewers of Super Bowl XXXIV
will see commercials for companies like Angeltips.com,
Computer.com, Kforce.com, Ourbeginning.com, Pets.com and Screaming
Media, all seeking to draw traffic to their Web sites or sell
various online goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Super Bowl is the one time of the year when the viewers
look forward to the commercials,'' said Jon Mandel, co-managing
director at Mediacom in New York, the media services arm of Grey
Advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a one-of-a-kind event,'' he added, ``reaching everybody:
men, women, children, pets. If you're trying to stand out, it's the
place to be.'' Grey is creating a Super Bowl commercial for
Kforce.com, a job search Web site owned by Romac International that
is formally known as the Knowledge Force Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very intense, hyperconcentrated atmosphere for these
companies, some of which you've heard of and some of which are
coming in cold,'' said Ted Sann, co-chief executive and chief
creative officer at BBDO New York, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit
of the Omnicom Group, which will create Super Bowl work for the
Charles Schwab online brokerage division as well as advertisers
without dots like Federal Express, PepsiCo and Visa.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a potential for confusion because the dot-com category
will be so cluttered, so they're going to have to differentiate
themselves on the spot,'' he added. ``If they don't have an
execution that's incredibly good, absolutely riveting, they'll just
be throwing the money away.''
</P>
<P>
   And what money it is. The estimated average of more than $2
million for each 30 seconds of commercial time compares with the
estimated average of $1.6 million charged by the News Corp.'s Fox
Broadcasting unit for each 30-second spot during last year's Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``If ABC could add a fifth quarter, they'd do it,'' DeWitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the demand from dot-coms, as well as the overall
strength of the advertising market, commercial time during the game
is almost sold out, though nine weeks remain before kickoff.
Reflecting that bull market, ABC is selling some of the last
commercial slots left for prices estimated at $3 million each.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dot-coms recognize they need that quick and effective
reach to drive people to their sites,'' said Marv Goldsmith,
president for sales and marketing at the ABC Television Network in
New York, part of the ABC unit of the Walt Disney Co. ``And several
are coming in on a competitive basis, reacting to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, besides the Kforce job search Web site, which is a
newcomer to the Super Bowl, two other job-search sites are buying
spots _ Hotjobs.com and Monster.com, part of TMP Worldwide. Both
are returning from last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious why we're back: The Super Bowl really worked for
us,'' said Dean Harris, senior vice president for marketing at
Hotjobs.com in New York. ``It drew traffic to our site and grew our
business.''
</P>
<P>
   But this year will be tougher. ``Last year, people hadn't been
asked to remember as many dot-com brands,'' said Edward Boches,
chief creative officer at Mullen Advertising in Wenham, Mass.,
Monster.com's agency that is part of the Lowe Group unit of the
Interpublic Group of Companies. ``Now it won't be as easy as
putting a name up on the screen with a dot-com after it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to have to give people a real reason why, make
them take a course of action,'' said Boches, whose agency is also
creating a spot for Oxygen Media, a Web site and cable TV network
aimed at women. ``That puts more pressure on the advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Wainwright, chief executive at Pets.com in San Francisco,
said, ``You have to have a strategy, a point of differentiation.''
The commercial for Pets.com by the San Francisco office of
TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of Omnicom, will
emphasize the Web site's breadth of merchandise as well as its
mascot, a sock-puppet dog.
</P>
<P>
   The creative content of most dot-com commercials tends to be
frenetic, cheeky, sometimes deliberately provocative, to help the
spots stand out. That affects not only the other dot-coms but also
other advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you know the commercials will be interesting, different,
contemporary, exciting, it keeps you on your toes,'' said Tony
Ponturo, vice president for media and sports marketing at
Anheuser-Busch in St. Louis, which for the 12th consecutive year
will be the exclusive beer advertiser during the Super Bowl. ``It
makes you lean forward and make sure you're sharp as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our estimates are that there's $500 million to $700 million of
dot-com money in the market place,'' he added. ``That's huge, more
than the beer category.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If by some chance the commercials for brews like Budweiser and
Bud Light fare poorly with viewers and critics on Jan. 30,
Anheuser-Busch will open for business come Jan. 31. That may not be
true for some dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   ``There'll be smart money out there and there'll be dumb money
out there,'' said Michael Sievert, vice president for marketing at
E(asterisk)Trade in Menlo Park, Calif. ``Unlike the `newbie'
entrants in the dot-com marketing craze, our approach is
investment, not expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dot-com clutter in some cases helps us because we're one
of the top four e-commerce brands,'' he added. ``The more focus and
attention on the Internet space, the more focus and attention there
is on the leaders.'' E(asterisk)Trade will spend an estimated $3.8
million on its halftime show sponsorship and accompanying
commercials by Goodby, Silverstein &AMP; Partners in San Francisco,
part of Omnicom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have a concern whether or not this pays off,''
acknowledged Jorge Cauz, senior vice president for Britannica.com
in Chicago, which will run a Super Bowl spot created by Deutsch
Inc. in New York. ``But we feel we're taking a calculated risk.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Most dot-com brands were not here two years ago, a
year ago, the day before yesterday. We have a brand that's 231
years old, so we're not coming to the dot-com environment as a
fly-by-night. The fact we're Britannica will make people ask `What
are they doing on the Internet?'''
</P>
<P>
   Whither the clamor for Super Bowl commercial time if the dot-com
boom goes bust? What primarily determines whether rates rise or
fall is the health of the general economy. And for now at least, as
Mandese noted, ``there's still huge demand from existing
advertisers'' like ``direct-to-consumer pharmaceuticals,
telecommunications and financial companies.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS, which is to broadcast the Super Bowl in January 2001, has
traded equity stakes in several dot-coms for commercial time. Some
of those spots could certainly run during Super Bowl XXXV.
</P>
<P>
   That inspired Mandese to predict ``the first deal for an
advertiser to trade equity to a network specifically for a Super
Bowl spot.''
</P>
<P>
   And of course, Super Bowl mishaps are not confined to dot-coms.
Take Just for Feet, a retail chain that was a first-time Super Bowl
advertiser last January. Its commercial was roundly criticized as
offensive. Then problems like an ill-timed expansion and changes in
footwear fashion led the company to file for federal bankruptcy
protection.
</P>
<P>
   The result: The first Super Bowl spot from Just for Feet may
very well have been its last.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be a dot-com to be stupid,'' said DeWitt of
DeWitt Media.

HORRY HAVING TROUBLE CRACKING LAKERS LINEUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This just in: Robert Horry is still a Laker.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you were uncertain, what with Horry seeming to have fallen
off the Los Angeles Lakers' radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   But the 6-foot-10 forward is alive and well, even if out of any
perceptible rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Horry is finding playing time difficult to come by. Bothered by
chronically sore knees, he missed the start of the season,
struggled when he returned, and gets inconsistent playing time off
Phil Jackson's bench.
</P>
<P>
   Originally a small forward who started on Houston's two
championship clubs in 1994 and 1995, executive vice president Jerry
West envisioned Horry as the perfect complementary outside piece to
Shaquille O'Neal. In 1996, Horry averaged 12 points and 5.8
rebounds per game, while connecting on 142 3-pointers for the
Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Horry, however, has not been the same player as a Laker. Last
year he was converted to power forward with mixed results. This
season he is shooting just 33 percent from the field, and has
missed on his only three 3-point attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Despite averaging only 14 minutes per game, Horry said he is not
frustrated at trying to win Jackson's favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope, not at all,'' Horry said. ``I think it's one of those
situations where everybody has to get used to everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you do (have to win a new coach's confidence),
sometimes you don't. I think he's trying to get a feel for what I
can do, and I'm just trying to get a feel for what he's looking
for. We're feeling each other out.''
</P>
<P>
   Horry said his knees have improved, but said it with both
wrapped in ice after Sunday's practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel good now _ I haven't been playing,'' he said. ``They
bother me a little bit, every now and then. I've been doing the
right things to keep them healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Horry said the trouble stems from ``too many days growing up,
playing on concrete. I should have spent more time inside.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have been looking for someone to spark an
underachieving bench, and Horry would seem a likely candidate. Yet
it's hard to have an impact or develop a rhythm when the playing
time is so irregular.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to be patient,'' Horry said.
</P>
<P>
   Getting your guard up: With Tyronn Lue eligible to come off the
injured list but still out with a sore knee, and Brian Shaw sitting
on the sidelines Sunday at practice with a sprained ankle, Jackson
started preparing rookie Devean George.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played almost exclusively today at guard,'' Jackson said.
``He has a hard time coming in and focusing right now. He has kinda
rookie-itis thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to come here and focus all the time and look at
this as a chance to be a proving ground. He thinks the game is his
chance. We're still working on that aspect, for him to come to
practice and get something from practice he can carry through to a
game.''
</P>
<P>
   George, never shy about putting it up, is averaging 3.8 points
per game, while shooting .438 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Layups: Forward Travis Knight cut the bottom of his chin during
practice and left to have stitches: ``I hit somebody's head.'' ...
Lue practiced without difficulty and is close to being activated.
Then Jackson will have to determine if he can keep both rookie John
Celestand and Lue on the roster. Said Jackson: ``There are a lot of
small guards in this league now. We could possibly have them
together. I haven't made that as a declaration yet. I'm still
looking at that as a possibility.''

POLLS AND PUNDITS HOLD ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (With FBC-TOP25) 
 (nk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In six days the computers will make it official: top-ranked and
11-0 Florida State vs. No. 2 and 11-0 Virginia Tech for the
national championship in the Sugar Bowl. In 12 days, Heisman voters
will do the same: Ron Dayne of Wisconsin will win the trophy as the
best college football player of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But should those things happen?
</P>
<P>
   Before that is answered, here are some mysteries that show that
this season has hardly played to form. On the pleasant side, there
are the remarkable turnarounds that landed Hawaii, Boston College
and Stanford in bowl games.
</P>
<P>
   With 19 starters back from a Hawaii team that went 0-12 last
year, the new coach, June Jones, installed the run-and-shoot
offense and led the Rainbow Warriors (8-4) into the Oahu Bowl
against Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time since the seniors were able to walk
around the field and then come back for another game,'' the
sophomore guard Manly Kanoa III said after Hawaii lost Saturday at
home, 22-14, to Washington State. ``These seniors are awesome. They
deserve one last game to go out as winners.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years removed from a gambling scandal and after
back-to-back 4-7 seasons, Boston College (8-3) will face Oklahoma
in the Insight.com Bowl. How unlikely is that? Coach Tom O'Brien
recalled that when he asked one of his seniors what he thought of
the Eagles' chances after they concluded spring practice, tight end
Bryan Arndt deadpanned, ``I hope the freshmen are good.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally there is Stanford (8-3), which got blown out by Texas,
69-17, in its opener and lost to lowly San Jose State, 44-39, but
is bound for the Rose Bowl as the Pacific-10 champion against Dayne
and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it shows you our heart and character,'' wide
receiver Troy Walters said after the Cardinals outlasted Notre Dame
on Saturday, 40-37. ``We could have easily thrown in the towel.''
</P>
<P>
   The disappointing side of the mystery ledger is just as crowded.
Remember the pre-season credibility invested in Arizona's national
title aspirations? The Wildcats lost to Arizona State, 42-27, on
Saturday, finished 6-6 and won't play in a bowl. For nine weeks,
Penn State too had designs on the national championship until three
consecutive losses have the Nittany Lions remembering the Alamo _
the bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   There is also Notre Dame, whose loss to Stanford sent the Irish
(5-7) to their first losing season in 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt we've ever given up as many big plays as we've given
up this year,'' Notre Dame Coach Bob Davie said after the Stanford
game. ``When you can't cover and you self-destruct and turn the
ball over, you can't win.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing those teams and players have in common is that their
destinies were decided on the field. It's not clear yet if Virginia
Tech and Ron Dayne can say the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   If Virginia Tech somehow doesn't make it to the title game, it
will be a shame and rightfully blamed on computers. If Dayne
doesn't win the Heisman, it will be unfortunate and the human
voters will have to explain why.
</P>
<P>
   The Hokies are in limbo because of the Bowl Championship Series
ranking, a mathematical formula that determines the No. 1 and No. 2
teams to match them in a championship game. Because the formula
includes eight computer rankings, the BCS' No. 3 team, Nebraska,
clings to an ever-so-slight possibility of bumping Virginia Tech
from the Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers have lost once, but some computer rankings
reward their tougher schedule. To sustain the suspense, Nebraska
needs to avenge its loss to Texas in the Big 12 title game on
Saturday. The Cornhuskers would benefit by doing so in
running-up-the-score fashion after needing overtime to beat
Colorado, 33-30, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If Nebraska does win big, BCS officials are in for a tense
Saturday night wondering whether artificial intelligence will
override the votes and wisdom of the coaches and news media polls _
also components of the formula _ both of which say Virginia Tech is
the No. 2 team.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Dayne wins the Heisman has more to do with style than
substance. He's a big, hard runner who broke the career rushing
record set by Ricky Williams of Texas last year. He isn't
particularly highlight-reel friendly and doesn't have a colorful
tale to engage reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne doesn't excite the same constituencies that like big-play
sparks and have touted the candidacies of Florida State wide
receiver Peter Warrick, Georgia Tech quarterback Joe Hamilton or
even Virginia Tech quarterback Michael Vick, who developed a
belated following as a Heisman contender.
</P>
<P>
   But each player's campaign ran into trouble. Warrick
participated in a shopping scam that led to a misdemeanor guilty
plea and cost him a two-game suspension. Hamilton's chances were
snuffed when Georgia Tech lost for the third time, to mediocre Wake
Forest. Vick was noticed only late in the season and is penalized
for being a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   The strangest knock against Dayne is that the Heisman isn't a
career achievement reward but a trophy for the season's best
player. Yes, he broke Williams' record, but he also rushed for
1,834 yards and 19 touchdowns this year and led the Badgers (9-2)
to the Rose Bowl as Big Ten champions for the second consecutive
year. Those are pretty good numbers in a pretty good season.
</P>
<P>
   So, if the focus is kept on the field, there really isn't much
mystery left in this season.
</P>
<P>
   Only Nebraska fans can honestly believe that their 10-1 team
deserves a chance to play Florida State for the title. Despite the
human hand-wringing, the computers will compute the right thing and
send Virginia Tech to the Sugar Bowl, just as voters will vote the
right way and award the Heisman Trophy to Dayne. This is the era,
after all, in which mankind is in harmony with technology, isn't
it?

AN EYE ON THE ECONOMY, TO 2000 AND BEYOND 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK_ With about a month left in the millennium, the three
major stock indexes are poised to record annual returns of more
than 10 percent each for the fifth year in a row _ an unprecedented
streak.
</P>
<P>
   But the wealth generated by the indexes' gains may also pose the
biggest threat to a repeat performance in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   If the indexes keep rising, some economists argue, the stock
market will continue to fuel consumer spending. Such buying makes
it unlikely that the economy, which surged at a 5.5 percent annual
growth rate in the third quarter, will slow enough to satisfy
Federal Reserve policy-makers. The Fed will then be forced to raise
short-term interest rates, adding to its three quarter-point
increases since June. And higher rates could spook equity investors
if they conclude that the economy and earnings growth will finally
slow significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the stock market continues to go up at the rate we have had
in the last couple of months, the Fed will be unhappy and raise
interest rates,'' said Stephen Slifer, the chief U.S. economist at
Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average has jumped almost 1,000 points,
or 9.7 percent, in six weeks. In the same period, the Standard &AMP;
Poor's index of 500 stocks is up 13.6 percent , while the Nasdaq
index has surged 26.2 percent. In light holiday trading Friday, the
Dow slipped 19.26 points to 10,988.91, while the S&AMP;P 500 fell 0.46
point, to 1,416.62. But the Nasdaq rose 27.31 points to a new high
of 3,447.81.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks were higher earlier in the day after the government
reported that personal income jumped 1.3 percent in October, the
largest monthly gain in five and a half years.
</P>
<P>
   Slifer suspects that these rallies have given a new impetus to
consumer spending and housing construction, and in turn may reverse
the slight slowing in economic growth that was reflected in flat
retail sales in September and October, a slowdown in automobile
sales those months and a plunge in new home sales in September.
</P>
<P>
   While he cannot be sure yet, he sees possible signs of new
economic vigor in the jump in the consumer confidence index back to
its recent highs and the return to the highs of this summer in the
home purchase index.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we are seeing a few signs of slower growth right now,''
he said, ``if these new signals are right, we will see faster
growth a couple of months down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of this, he said, he is tempted to raise his already
strong outlook of 4.3 percent growth for the fourth quarter and is
considering the addition of a Fed rate increase to his 2000
forecast. He had expected the increase earlier this month to be the
last for the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., has
already added a Fed rate increase to his forecast. ``I think the
economy is going to remain strong through all of next year,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Fed raised its interest rate target on federal funds,
which is the rate banks lend money to one another overnight, a
quarter of a percentage point to 5.5 percent on Nov. 16, bond
investors have worried about the persistent strength in the economy
and the possibility of more rate increases. But stock investors do
not appear to have skipped a beat.
</P>
<P>
   The divergence in views is obvious in the markets' performance.
Since then, the Nasdaq index has moved to six new highs, the S&AMP;P
500 to two and the Dow, until Friday, was back to more than 11,000
points the first time since Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   But the bond market has sold off. In a short day of trading
Friday, the price of the 30-year bond fell 13/32, while the yield,
which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.23 percent from
6.20 percent Wednesday and 6.02 percent the day before the Fed rate
increase. The yield on the two-year note, which is more sensitive
to the threat of a Fed rate move, rose Friday to 5.98 percent from
5.94 percent Wednesday and 5.75 percent before the Fed's action.
</P>
<P>
   One factor that has blunted fears about a strong economy next
year is the belief that the Federal Reserve's speed limit for
acceptable growth has risen. While no one knows the actual number,
analysts suspect it is about 3 percent to 3.5 percent, rather than
the 2 percent to 2.5 percent of years past. The reason for the
change is a sharp rise in productivity, which means workers are
producing more goods at the same cost and keeping inflation
pressures more subdued.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg expects the gross domestic product to grow 3.7 percent
next year, while Slifer sees a more modest 3.4 percent. So the
economy may attain an acceptable level without more rate increases.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But if growth in the fourth quarter comes in as expected at more
than 4 percent, the pace of the last six months will be about 5
percent. And assuming that the economy will be easy to slow
contradicts its performance over the last several years.
</P>
<P>
   Fed policy-makers signaled this problem in the statement that
accompanied their last rate increase. ``Despite tentative evidence
of a slowing in certain interest-sensitive sectors of the economy
and of accelerating productivity,'' they said, ``the expansion of
activity continues in excess of the economy's growth potential. As
a consequence, the pool of available workers willing to take jobs
has been drawn down further in recent months, a trend that must
eventually be contained if inflationary imbalances are to remain in
check and economic expansion continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Policy-makers added that the three rate increases this year,
along with the rise in market interest rates, ``should markedly
diminish the risk of inflation going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Slifer, who has been confident that prices are in check, admits
to ``getting a tad nervous'' as he looks at the recent rise in the
prices of oil and new and used cars. ``We are pushing this envelope
as far as we can push it,'' he said.

CLINTON TO SIGN BILL GIVING FOOD AID TO SUDANESE REBELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is about to sign a bill
permitting the administration to pursue a contentious strategy
against the Islamic government in Sudan by giving food assistance
directly to rebels who have been fighting the authorities in
Khartoum for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is designed by its advocates in the State Department
and the National Security Council to strengthen the military
operations of the Sudan People's Liberation Army and to isolate the
government, which Washington has accused of backing international
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   But critics, including some administration officials as well as
major humanitarian groups, contend that giving food to the rebels
is another example of the evolving administration policy of
humanitarian intervention that inserts the United States on one
side of a civil war as squarely as when the Reagan administration
supported anti-communist guerrillas in Africa and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Further, providing sustenance to fighters _ using food as a
weapon of war _ contravenes the long-held principle of neutrality
in food assistance during conflicts, said Julia Taft, the assistant
secretary of state for refugees and humanitarian assistance. ``This
is a departure from the way we should be using food aid,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is to sign an aid bill that authorizes direct assistance
to the rebels in southern Sudan on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The language was included in the bill by a group of Senate and
House members with the backing of the assistant secretary of state
for African affairs, Susan Rice, and the director for Africa at the
National Security Council, Gayle Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The civil war in Sudan has raised high emotions in Congress and
in the administration because it pits a rigid Islamic regime
against Christian rebels. Church coalitions have charged that the
government organizes militias to abduct southerners into slavery
and transport them to the north.
</P>
<P>
   John Pendergast, a special adviser to Ms. Rice, said the food
aid would enable the rebels to maintain positions in the parched
territory where they are fighting the northern army and
government-backed militia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so forces can eat more easily and resupply forces in
food-deficit areas,'' Pendergast said. It is hoped that the food
will allow the rebels ``to stay in position or expand positions in
places where it is difficult to maintain a logistical line,'' he
Pendergast said.
</P>
<P>
   Pendergast acknowledged that there would be an ``internal
battle'' in the administration over whether to implement the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Clinton nor Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has
taken a public position on the issue, although Albright has
received papers from Mrs. Taft's office arguing against the policy.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the effort to give aid to the rebels is Ms. Rice's
belief that the Khartoum regime, which has been controlled by the
National Islamic Front since 1990, should be isolated and punished
as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the administration attacked a pharmaceutical plant in
Khartoum with cruise missiles because of suspicions that the
factory was involved with the production of chemical weapons and
was linked to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born militant who is
suspected of masterminding the August 1998 bombings of American
Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the administration said that the efforts to isolate
the regime were futile, since allies, including France, Britain,
Canada and Saudi Arabia, were beginning to seek rapprochement with
the Sudanese government and to invest in its new oil industry.
China has taken a major stake in the government's oil company.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has also harshly criticized the Sudan
People's Liberation Army. In this year's Human Rights Report, the
State Department said officials of the southern rebels were
``responsible for extrajudicial killings, beatings, arbitrary
detention, forced conscription, slavery and occasional arrests of
foreign relief workers without charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to bolster the rebels, the administration
should put more effort into supporting peace talks, said Peter
Bell, the president of CARE USA, a major humanitarian group that
donates food to both sides of the war in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to Kenya last month, Albright met with the
Sudanese rebel leader, John Garang, and discouraged an effort by
Egypt and Libya to broker a peace deal between the government and
his forces.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she gave support to a more narrow and almost moribund
peace process sponsored by seven East African nations under the
umbrella of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said the United States should work beyond that process and
use its ``large influence'' to bring the parties together.
</P>
<P>
   This is an especially critical time to try to forge a peace deal
to end Africa's longest-running conflict because the Khartoum
government is poised to reap profits from its oil industry that
could be used to revitalize its war machine, he said. Giving food
aid to the rebels was more likely to prolong the conflict rather
than solve it, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States could do much more to put a just peace at
the center of its policy,'' Bell said. ``After two million dead and
four million displaced, we need to end the conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Bell said that CARE would not take part in food
deliveries to the rebels that might be funded by the American
government. ``It's a mistake because it's to use food as a weapon
of war and counter to humanitarian principles.''
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. program known as Operation Lifeline Sudan, which has been
distributing food by air, barge and train to civilians trapped by
the war for the past 10 years, could also be jeopardized by U.S.
efforts to provide only the rebels with sustenance.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has contributed about $1 billion to the U.N. program,
which gives food to civilians on both sides and is conducted with
the acquiesence of the Khartoum government.
</P>
<P>
   If the Clinton administration gave food to rebel fighters,
Khartoum would undoubtedly try to shut down the U.N. effort, U.N.
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have stronger opposition from Khartoum and there will be
greater risk for everyone involved,'' said Nils Kastberg, the
director of emergency programs for UNICEF, which runs the Sudan
food program for the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Another major donor to the Operation Lifeline Sudan program,
World Vision, would also decline to participate in efforts to
support the rebels directly, a spokesman, Serge Duss, said.
</P>
<P>
   Duss said the leaders of 10 nongovernmental aid organizations,
including World Vision, met with Albright in October before she
visited Africa and urged the administration to take a ``broader
approach'' to the Sudanese war.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how the administration would organize giving food aid to
the rebel forces, which are dispersed across a vast swathe of
southern Sudan, was not clear. Pendergast said that whatever
logistical methods were chosen, they would be separate from the
operation at Lokichokio, in northern Kenya, where an airfield is
used by the U.N. program to fly into Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   One way of getting food to the rebels would be for the United
States or an intermediary to give large quantities of grain to the
government in Kenya and allow government workers or others there to
organize the distribution, a congressional aide said.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation that Clinton is to sign Monday overrides a law
that prohibits U.S. food assistance from being given to combatants
before they demobilize, the aide said.

<P>
   BLACKSBURG, Va. _ Hordes of ecstatic football fans poured into
this university town over the holiday weekend, but perhaps none
gave more meaning to the spectacle than little Patrick Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick, a dimpled 7-year-old, came all the way from Boston, his
hometown, to watch his favorite team play football. Boston College
was taking on Virginia Tech, and Patrick sat in the stands with his
father, William, a 42-year-old firefighter. Unlike his father,
though, Patrick roots for Virginia Tech. He already plans to attend
the university when he graduates from high school in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're really good and they're ranked second in the whole
country,'' Patrick said by way of explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Thus has a run at a national championship propelled this
out-of-the-way Appalachian town into the national spotlight. On
Friday, the Hokies, as Virginia Tech's team is known, defeated
Boston College to end its season with an undefeated record of 11-0
and set the stage for a likely slot in the Sugar Bowl to decide the
national championship on Jan. 4. The school is enjoying the kind of
publicity that reams of press releases about academic programs
could never equal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports will do that,'' said Roger Hedgpeth, a Virginia Tech
alumnus who has been Blacksburg's mayor for the last 18 years.
``Nobel Prizes certainly get a lot of attention, but there's
nothing like having a football team that's No. 2 to get
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Applications to Virginia Tech have increased 30 percent over
last year, university officials report, while requests to use its
logo have increased from about three of four per week to as many as
10 per day. Hokie memorabilia is disappearing from store shelves as
quickly as it can be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to watch Virginia Tech now,'' said Paul
Torgersen, the university's president, who was busy over the
weekend entertaining congressional representatives from other parts
of the state and members of the Virginia General Assembly, some of
whom have only recently caught what has been dubbed Hokie-mania.
(The team nickname comes from a nonsense word in a 19th-century
school cheer.)
</P>
<P>
   Blacksburg's Main Street is typical of many college towns around
the country, with rows of bars and restaurants, broken up by the
occasional barber shop or boutique. Lately, though, this street has
had an audible buzz that comes with ESPN trucks and out-of-town
journalists, with weekly articles in Sports Illustrated and live
reports on CNN. The town now boasts two national celebrities in the
Hokies' head coach, Frank Beamer, and its star freshman
quarterback, Michael Vick.
</P>
<P>
   To understand what all the attention means here requires a
knowledge of the history embedded in the region. The original
settlers of southwestern Virginia were Scots-Irish pioneers, who
made a living on hilly corn and cattle farms and, later, in coal
fields. They were a different lot than the landed English who owned
sprawling plantations to the east.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech, founded in 1872 as Virginia Agricultural and
Mechanical College, has long played second fiddle to the University
of Virginia in Charlottesville, some 150 miles to the northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Although Virginia Tech boasts one of the best engineering
schools in the country and an excellent reputation in computers, it
still suffers the stigma of being a school for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   University of Virginia students never fail to remind Virginia
Tech of its supposed place in the intellectual pecking order. When
the Hokie football team handily dispatched the Virginia Cavaliers
in Charlottesville in October, Virginia students were heard to
chant: ``Hey, hey, that's OK, you'll all be working for us
someday.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech fans have always been loyal, even when their team
was known more for court appearances than for its play on the
field. In 1995 and 1996, 21 football players were arrested in a
12-month period on charges ranging from alcohol violations to rape.
Torgersen responded in early 1997 by instituting a tougher
disciplinary policy for athletes. The school's football players
have had only occasional run-ins with the law since then, and this
year the eyes of the state, and of much of the nation, have been
fixed firmly on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some extent, at this point, I think we're carrying the flag
of Virginia,'' said Torgersen, who will retire at the end of the
year. ``Everybody is a Hokie.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone at Virginia Tech is excited about the school's
arrival as a sports power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it and I'm not the only one,'' said Henry H.
Bauer, an interdisciplinary studies professor and former dean.
Bauer said sports may give alumni something to do on the weekends,
but they have little connection to a public university's academic
mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember when the reason for college sports was to build
character,'' he said. ``That's gone by the board. The reason now is
to get attention and TV revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   That is just fine with some people.
</P>
<P>
   ``People seem to be nicer, and they tip better,'' said Bill
Thran, a Virginia Tech senior who works as a bartender at PK's, a
popular nightspot, speaking of the mood in town. ``I think it's
good for the school. Hopefully we'll get more funding, more
attention and better students.''

   BLACKSBURG, Va. _ Hordes of ecstatic football fans poured into
this university town over the holiday weekend, but perhaps none
gave more meaning to the spectacle than little Patrick Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick, a dimpled 7-year-old, came all the way from Boston, his
hometown, to watch his favorite team play football. Boston College
was taking on Virginia Tech, and Patrick sat in the stands with his
father, William, a 42-year-old firefighter. Unlike his father,
though, Patrick roots for Virginia Tech. He already plans to attend
the university when he graduates from high school in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're really good and they're ranked second in the whole
country,'' Patrick said by way of explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Thus has a run at a national championship propelled this
out-of-the-way Appalachian town into the national spotlight. On
Friday, the Hokies, as Virginia Tech's team is known, defeated
Boston College to end its season with an undefeated record of 11-0
and set the stage for a likely slot in the Sugar Bowl to decide the
national championship on Jan. 4. The school is enjoying the kind of
publicity that reams of press releases about academic programs
could never equal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports will do that,'' said Roger Hedgpeth, a Virginia Tech
alumnus who has been Blacksburg's mayor for the last 18 years.
``Nobel Prizes certainly get a lot of attention, but there's
nothing like having a football team that's No. 2 to get
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Applications to Virginia Tech have increased 30 percent over
last year, university officials report, while requests to use its
logo have increased from about three of four per week to as many as
10 per day. Hokie memorabilia is disappearing from store shelves as
quickly as it can be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to watch Virginia Tech now,'' said Paul
Torgersen, the university's president, who was busy over the
weekend entertaining congressional representatives from other parts
of the state and members of the Virginia General Assembly, some of
whom have only recently caught what has been dubbed Hokie-mania.
(The team nickname comes from a nonsense word in a 19th-century
school cheer.)
</P>
<P>
   Blacksburg's Main Street is typical of many college towns around
the country, with rows of bars and restaurants, broken up by the
occasional barber shop or boutique. Lately, though, this street has
had an audible buzz that comes with ESPN trucks and out-of-town
journalists, with weekly articles in Sports Illustrated and live
reports on CNN. The town now boasts two national celebrities in the
Hokies' head coach, Frank Beamer, and its star freshman
quarterback, Michael Vick.
</P>
<P>
   To understand what all the attention means here requires a
knowledge of the history embedded in the region. The original
settlers of southwestern Virginia were Scots-Irish pioneers, who
made a living on hilly corn and cattle farms and, later, in coal
fields. They were a different lot than the landed English who owned
sprawling plantations to the east.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech, founded in 1872 as Virginia Agricultural and
Mechanical College, has long played second fiddle to the University
of Virginia in Charlottesville, some 150 miles to the northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Although Virginia Tech boasts one of the best engineering
schools in the country and an excellent reputation in computers, it
still suffers the stigma of being a school for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   University of Virginia students never fail to remind Virginia
Tech of its supposed place in the intellectual pecking order. When
the Hokie football team handily dispatched the Virginia Cavaliers
in Charlottesville in October, Virginia students were heard to
chant: ``Hey, hey, that's OK, you'll all be working for us
someday.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech fans have always been loyal, even when their team
was known more for court appearances than for its play on the
field. In 1995 and 1996, 21 football players were arrested in a
12-month period on charges ranging from alcohol violations to rape.
Torgersen responded in early 1997 by instituting a tougher
disciplinary policy for athletes. The school's football players
have had only occasional run-ins with the law since then, and this
year the eyes of the state, and of much of the nation, have been
fixed firmly on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some extent, at this point, I think we're carrying the flag
of Virginia,'' said Torgersen, who will retire at the end of the
year. ``Everybody is a Hokie.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone at Virginia Tech is excited about the school's
arrival as a sports power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it and I'm not the only one,'' said Henry H.
Bauer, an interdisciplinary studies professor and former dean.
Bauer said sports may give alumni something to do on the weekends,
but they have little connection to a public university's academic
mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember when the reason for college sports was to build
character,'' he said. ``That's gone by the board. The reason now is
to get attention and TV revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   That is just fine with some people.
</P>
<P>
   ``People seem to be nicer, and they tip better,'' said Bill
Thran, a Virginia Tech senior who works as a bartender at PK's, a
popular nightspot, speaking of the mood in town. ``I think it's
good for the school. Hopefully we'll get more funding, more
attention and better students.''

CISCO TO OFFER MORE DETAILS ON WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new wireless technology is about to join the contest to
provide high-speed Internet connections to homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems, a leading Internet technology company, plans to
brief analysts and reporters on Wednesday about a new approach to
wireless communications that would be offered as soon as next year
to provide both voice telephone service and Internet access. The
technology is meant to be a nonmobile _ or fixed _ wireless
alternative to the telephone industry's high-speed digital phone
lines and to the cable television industry's Internet modems.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's briefing will offer the first detailed plans after an
announcement last month by the company, Motorola and 10 other
equipment makers and service providers that said they would create
an industry-standard format for sending Internet data over a
long-existing, little-used set of microwave frequencies.
</P>
<P>
   That frequency band, known as multichannel multipoint
distribution services, or MMDS, was set aside years ago for a form
of wireless subscription television that was meant to compete with
cable television but never really caught on. More recently, MMDS
has been seen as a way for telecommunications giants like Sprint
and MCI Worldcom to compete with the regional Bell operating
companies to provide direct connections to local telephone
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Now Cisco and other equipment makers are trying to push MMDS
into a full-blown voice and Internet-access technology.
</P>
<P>
   Use of the MMDS frequencies requires licenses from the Federal
Communications Commission. But the commission has also set aside
wireless frequencies in a band called the Unlicensed National
Information Infrastructure. This second, unlicensed frequency band
is meant to encourage experimental uses of the airwaves without the
expense of buying or applying for licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Because Cisco's technology will also work with this unlicensed
band, the company predicts that smaller Internet service providers
and communications companies will be able to quickly enter and
compete in the market for high-speed _ or broad band _ Internet
access at relatively low cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fixed broad-band wireless access will change the world of
telecommunications as profoundly as mobile telephony,'' said Dale
R. Pfau, a financial analyst at CIBC World Markets in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco executives predicted that consumers would be able to buy
broad band wireless transmitter-receivers _ known as transceivers _
for less than $500 by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the Cisco-led alliance's plans is a new wireless
approach developed by a Silicon Valley designer, which deals with a
thorny problem known as ``multipath interference'' that has long
bedeviled communications engineers. At certain frequencies,
wireless communications systems must contend with echoes from
secondary signals that are reflected from buildings or hills and
that arrive at the receiver slightly after the original signals.
</P>
<P>
   Television broadcasts, for example, have long been plagued by
the phenomenon, commonly known as ghosting.
</P>
<P>
   The problem became an intriguing challenge to Greg Raleigh, a
longtime Silicon Valley engineer, who in the early 1990s returned
to Stanford University to study for an advanced degree. Raleigh
realized that with the vast amounts of computer power now available
to perform signal processing it would be possible to transform
multipath interference from a disadvantage into a benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Raleigh knew that, besides ghosting, there is typically a second
drawback to fixed wireless communications: reliable transmissions
require a clear line of sight between the transmitter and the
receiver. That requirement poses special challenges to network
designers attempting to reach tens of thousands of receivers in an
urban area.
</P>
<P>
   But by using special encoding techniques, Raleigh reasoned, it
might be possible to offer reliable two-way communications that
would not require direct lines of site but would instead use
ghosting echoes as intentional signal paths rather than treating
them as unwanted interference.
</P>
<P>
   With two of his Stanford classmates, Raleigh founded a company,
Clarity Wireless, in an extra room in his home. There, they
developed his theory into a technology called vector orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing, or VOFDM.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco acquired Clarity Wireless in 1998 and recently decided to
freely share its technology in an effort to quickly establish it as
an industry standard. So far, besides Motorola, Cisco has secured
commitments from Toshiba, Samsung, Texas Instruments and others to
help develop components of the broadband wireless infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's is not the only approach in the MMDS broad-band data
market, however. The company's wireless competitors will include
Spike Technologies, ADC Telecommunications and Adaptive Broadband.
But Cisco's prominence as an Internet technology vendor, along with
the powerful alliance it has built, could give the company an
inside edge, some analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no real leader as yet, but Cisco has quite a strong
story,'' said Tim Luke, a financial analyst at Lehman Brothers in
New York.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, some telecommunications analysts point out that MMDS
occupies a relatively limited frequency band. That means, they say,
that communications carriers would need to set up a large number of
transmitters in order to subdivide a metropolitan area into
numerous cells to allow the same channels to be reused in different
parts of the region.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco executives nevertheless contend that broad-band fixed
wireless technology can be a cost-effective alternative to cable
modems and digital phone lines in urban areas. As for rural areas,
Cisco says that broadband wireless will hold dramatic advantages
over traditional wired or fiber optic networks, which can be costly
ways to provide service in sparsely settled places.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the Cisco alliance, if its technology proves viable,
will be in a position to compete for the many companies and
consumers that seem to have developed an insatiable appetite for
Internet data communications bandwidth.
</P>
<P>
   Service providers like Winstar, Nextlink and Teligent have
already developed a significant business providing so-called
point-to-point broad-band wireless communications in urban areas.
Those services permit corporations and buildings in urban areas to
bypass local telephone and fiber optic communications links and
connect directly to Internet providers or long-distance carriers or
to connect to another branch office in the same metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco intends to make these point-to-point customers the first
target for its new VOFDM technology. The company will soon begin
selling a high-speed wireless system that will permit companies to
extend communications between buildings over relatively short
distances.
</P>
<P>
   The point-to-point wireless microwave equipment market,
according to Pfau of CIBC World Markets, was about $2.56 billion in
1998 and is expected to grow to $5 billion by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The more versatile point-to-multipoint market, which will
develop for consumer and commercial applications, is forecast to
grow to $3 billion in 2004 from less than $200 million next year.
</P>
<P>
   Raleigh, of Cisco, said that he believed the Cisco technology
had a promising commercial future in part because of new radio
spectrum that will be made available for interactive data
applications.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, for example, there will soon be an auction for radio
spectrum at the 3.5 gigahertz frequencies. Meanwhile, in the United
States, the FCC plans to auction spectrum for interactive data in
the frequency band that until now has been used solely for
ultrahigh frequency, or UHF, television.

SEEING ENEMIES EVERYWHERE, SERBIA BEGINS A LEGAL OFFENSIVE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ In recent weeks, Serbia has become
enveloped in a frenzy of arrests and trials that fills the
television news programs and newspapers, enhancing the siege
atmosphere in an isolated state.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic accusations came Thursday when Information
Minister Goran Matic revealed that Serbian authorities had
uncovered a plot to assassinate President Slobodan Milosevic. Five
men, Serbs from Bosnia and Serbia, were arrested and accused of
plotting to kill the president under the supposed orders of the
French intelligence service _ a charge France swiftly denied.
</P>
<P>
   The men were mercenaries, Matic said, and, while working for the
French, had also committed atrocities in Kosovo and at Srebrenica
in Bosnia (where Serbian forces are thought to have slaughtered
thousands of Muslim men in one of the worst mass killings in Europe
since 1945).
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Matic showed videotapes of the men and
their passports, although he has yet to produce any direct evidence
connecting them with an attempt to kill Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The startling revelations nevertheless filled newspapers and
news programs on state television.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers and human rights organizations say they detect
increasing signs of what they call the government's isolation andparanoia. Several members of the opposition have been subject to
violent attacks, harassment and hefty fines; around the country,
there are trials of alleged members of paramilitary groups,
supposed members of the Kosovo Liberation Army and people the
authorities denounce as traitors.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the judicial activity is normal, said Barbara Davis,
representative in Belgrade for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human
Rights. There is often a rush of trials from November through
January, she said, since prosecutors tend to prepare them in
September and October after the summer break.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the war in Kosovo and the opposition rallies that followed
the end of the war have resulted in an enormous number of political
trials. Hundreds of ethnic Albanians arrested last spring in Kosovo
during NATO's bombing campaign are now being tried, mostly on
charges of terrorism. A number of Serbian civilians, among them a
journalist, a television technician and an icon painter, have
recently gone on trial for undermining the authority of the state.
</P>
<P>
   And now the authorities have begun prosecuting members of
paramilitary groups, accusing them of committing war crimes, spying
for the foreign governments, and threatening the life of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   The five men in the latest case, four from Serbia and one from
Bosnia, were arrested more than two weeks ago and have yet to go on
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Two other cases will soon begin. In the town of Kraljevo, 12
men, described as mujahedeen, or Islamic fighters, are to be tried
for terrorism and conspiracy against Yugoslavia. The men are said
by the authorities to possess passports from Sweden, Norway, Egypt
and Turkey, and to belong to a unit from Bosnia. They were arrested
on Serbia's border with Macedonia last year.
</P>
<P>
   A Serb man from Kosovo is also expected to go on trial soon in
the town of Pozarevac. Boban Petkovic, 33, from Velika Hoca, is
charged with killing three Albanian civilians. Another man, Djordje
Simic, 21, is to be tried as an accomplice.
</P>
<P>
   These cases, reported in small scraps in the Belgrade
newspapers, seem intended to try to blame the atrocities in Kosovo
and even Bosnia on small groups of men and thus to excuse the
government of Milosevic, who has been indicted in connection with
war crimes by the international tribunal in The Hague. Yugoslavia
refuses to cooperate with the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   But the cases that concern human rights lawyers most are those
of Serbs imprisoned for clearly political reasons, and of the
hundreds of Albanians from Kosovo, who are largely thought to be
innocent of the kinds of crimes that have earned some of them long
sentences. Lawyers and human rights organizations are scrambling to
attend all the trials going on around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Gradimir Nalic, a Belgrade lawyer and head of the Yugoslav
Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights, is defending a television
technician, Ivan Novkovic, who ran a tape on local television in
his hometown of Leskovac last summer urging people to walk downtown
to protest against the local Socialist-led government.
</P>
<P>
   Timing his tape for the break in a widely watched soccer match,
Novkovic drew an enormous crowd after the game. He is now on trial,
accused of misusing his position at the television station, and
damaging the reputation of the local government leader. His next
court appearance is scheduled for Dec. 22.
</P>
<P>
   He may experience the same fate as Bogoljub Arsenijevic, an icon
painter from Valjevo, known by his nickname, Maki, who emerged as
an inspirational leader of some of the opposition rallies in his
town. He was recently jailed for three years on charges of using
violence against the police during a demonstration.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another case that concerns human rights organizations is that of
Nebojsa Ristic, who ran the local television station in the small
town of Soko Banja. His station was shut down, and the police
confiscated two political posters, one advocating a free media and
another for the Student Resistance, a student opposition movement.
</P>
<P>
   Ristic was sentenced to one year in prison, convicted of
undermining public confidence in the state authorities. ``His
father is dying, he's a man in his 30s, it's a case we are very
concerned about,'' said Ms. Davis of the U.N. agency.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the Albanians is her greatest worry, said Ms. Davis.
Flora Brovina, a well-known doctor from Kosovo, is the most
prominent Albanian political prisoner. She is on trial in the
southern Serbian city of Nis. Last week, for the second time, her
case was postponed, this time because a key witness was said to
have been delayed by bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are delaying the case because they cannot make a
decision,'' said Nikola Barovic, U.N. legal counsel. ``You see the
results. Brovina is still in prison and they have time to make up
their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   With strong international interest in her case, Dr. Brovina may
be better off than most Albanians. Ten days ago, almost unnoticed,
12 Albanian farmers from Kosovo were sentenced in Prokuplje, a town
in southern Serbia, Barovic said. All the men received sentences of
14 years for terrorism in what Barovic described as a sham trial,
lacking in all legal standards and procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the 13th man in that group was dead,'' he added. The man
had died in police custody in May at the notorious Dubrava prison
in Kosovo, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ There will be hundreds of protesters in sea-turtle
costumes and stilt walkers dressed as monarch butterflies.
Thousands of people will tie up the downtown during a giant
demonstration, and protesters will chain themselves to buildings or
scale walls to unfurl banners denouncing the target of their ire:
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   In what is shaping up as one of the biggest protest efforts in
years, people from more than 500 organizations have poured into
Seattle. They accuse the 135-nation, Geneva-based world trade body,
which is holding its ministerial meeting here this week, of
favoring free trade at the expense of the environment, consumer
safety and workers' rights.
</P>
<P>
   The protest groups range from the well-known, like Friends of
the Earth and the Humane Society, to the obscure, like the Ruckus
Society and Raging Grannies.
</P>
<P>
   Several, including the Sierra Club and the United Steelworkers
of America, are planning a Seattle Tea Party on Monday with the
slogan ``No Globalization Without Representation.'' Imitating their
Boston forebears, the protesters plan to throw steel imported from
China into the sea as well as some shrimp, hormone-treated beef and
other goods they view as tainted by the trade body's decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The WTO responds to the needs and interests of the very rich
and corporations, but it doesn't respond to the needs of the
environment, labor, the poor, women or indigenous people,'' said
Alli Starr, a dancer in the radical group, Art and Revolution, who
flew in from San Francisco to protest and do street theater.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing a page from Vietnam War protests, the trade
organization's critics have scheduled a weeklong cavalcade of
activities, including teach-ins, concerts, people's tribunals for
corporations and appearances by sympathetic members of Congress.
Like the 1968 Democratic Party convention in Chicago, the trade
meeting has become a magnet for all manner of protest.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, hundreds of protesters plan to form a human
chain around Seattle's exhibition center to demand that wealthy
nations cancel the debt owed by the world's poor nations. The
biggest event will be a protest march on Tuesday sponsored by the
AFL-CIO, which wants the trade body to allow trade sanctions
against countries that violate core labor standards, like
prohibitions against child labor.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the groups hope to pressure the trade body to change its
ways, while others want to disrupt it, with the ultimate goal of
destroying it. In 1919, Seattle endured one of the nation's first
general strikes, but it has never experienced protests with people
from so many different groups _ labor unions, farm groups,
environmental groups _ and so many countries, including Canada,
France, Panama and India.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, trade ministers' meetings attracted only a
handful of protesters, who were largely seen as cranks, but the
protests have mushroomed and include many mainstream groups. The
protests have been fueled by the Internet, anxiety about
globalization and anger with World Trade Organization rulings.
</P>
<P>
   In the most-criticized ruling, the United States was found to
have acted illegally in barring imported shrimp caught by fishing
fleets whose nets do not contain devices allowing sea turtles to
escape. The protesters also oppose a ruling that an American
requirement for a smog-fighting gasoline additive was an unfair
trade barrier, and another that concluded that Europe had no
scientific basis for barring hormone-treated beef from the United
States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people are upset with the WTO because of the
expansiveness of its limits on government health and safety
actions,'' said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen's Global
Trade Watch, a Ralph Nader group. With 20 organizers here, that has
been the main coordinator of the protests. ``The WTO has managed to
gore everyone's ox. Its track record has been that every single
environmental or health policy it has reviewed has been found to be
an illegal trade barrier.''
</P>
<P>
   The ministers gathered here plan intense, closed-doors talks to
decide what specific areas of trade should be included in a
multiyear round of negotiations aimed at reducing trade barriers.
In contrast, many protesters hope to make their protests as visible
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the meeting has become Ground Zero for anyone with
a beef about the world economy. There are protesters against the
growing gap between rich and poor, against genetically engineered
products, against despoiling rain forests and against America's
economic and political dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be using a carnival festival model to oppose the
WTO,'' said Brooke Lehman, a New York-based protester active in a
group called No to WTO. ``Everybody is coming together to protest
the WTO and the corporate-dictated government it represents. We
regard the WTO as an undemocratic, illegitimate power.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixty groups in a coalition called the Turning Point Project are
spending more than $100,000 on full-page advertisements attacking
the trade body, saying that expanded agricultural trade is hurting
small farmers in dozens of countries and causing more pollution and
energy use.
</P>
<P>
   The Geneva-based trade body's defenders say globalization and
expanded trade are vital for making poor countries wealthier, and
some proponents suggest that many protesters want to stop economic
progress altogether. They also say it aims to promote free trade by
overturning various countries' laws or regulations that
discriminate against trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   With so many protesters crowding into Seattle, police officials
here say they fear some violence. Three protesters were arrested on
Saturday. Two had suspended a protest banner from a highway
retaining wall. But many protest leaders say they fear that
violence would detract from their message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm scared that if one anarchist throws a brick through a
store window downtown, that will become the big story, and our
whole critique of the WTO is going to get lost,'' said Michael
Dolan, Public Citizen's main coordinator of the protests.

U.S. WANTS TARIFFS ABOLISHED ON WOOD PRODUCTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Sidebar to WTO-Environment)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT McCLURE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Somewhere behind the posturing and speechifying of the
World Trade Organization conference this week, the ministers might
actually agree on something: abolishing border taxes on logs, wood
products and paper.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on whom you believe, such an agreement could mean more
jobs for U.S. workers, cheaper housing worldwide and increased
environmental protections; or it could mean more endangered
species, fewer jobs for U.S. workers and, in the Third World,
flooding, landslides, hobbled agriculture and ruined fishing.
</P>
<P>
   United States trade representatives are pushing hard for what
they call ``accelerated tariff liberalization'' and what
environmentalists term a ``global free logging agreement.'' It
would phase out all tariffs on wood, wood products and paper goods
almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an economic standpoint, it would be promoting highly
inefficient trade and it would be ecologically damaging,'' contends
Dave Batker, an economist with the Asia Pacific Environmental
Exchange. He points out that forests help provide clean water that
nourishes farm crops and keeps fisheries healthy, and also help
stabilize hillsides.
</P>
<P>
   ``These forests provide economically valuable services. We need
to measure the value of those services versus having a little more
wood,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Counters Toby Murray of the Murray Pacific Corporation in
Tacoma, Wash., a member of Washington's Forest Practices Board:
``When free markets are opened up, wealth flows. When wealth flows,
the environmental standards start going up.''
</P>
<P>
   World trade in paper, timber and other ``forest products'' has
quadrupled since 1970. This new proposal would accelerate that
trend.
</P>
<P>
   Abolishing tariffs on wood products would boost timber-cutting
worldwide by half a percentage point during the next decade, the
Clinton administration estimated in a report released earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   There would be little effect on the amount of lumber cut in the
United States, but U.S. exports of some finished ``value-added''
products such as some paper and board products would increase,
while U.S. exports of raw logs and wood chips would probably
decline, administration economists project.
</P>
<P>
   The effect overseas? Depends on where you live. Malaysia might
see timber-cutting increase 2.6 percent and Indonesia 4.4 percent.
Mexico could expect logging to fall 2.1 percent and Russia 4.1
percent, the report estimated. The largest increases in timbering
would be Sweden's 7.6 percent and Finland's 11 percent, with those
boosts coming out of timber plantations rather than natural
old-growth forests, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Admittedly, overall it is a small increase,'' says Dan
Seligman, the Sierra Club's point person on the WTO. ``But more
importantly, logging will increase in some of the world's most
threatened and fragile rain forests, such as Indonesia and
Malaysia.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably the biggest fear of environmental activists is that
once tariffs are eliminated, trade ministers will start talking
about trimming back so-called ``non-tariff barriers to trade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That could be the Endangered Species Act. That could be the
Northwest Forest Plan,'' charges Marty Bergoffen of the Southern
Appalachian Biodiversity Project. ``That could be anything that
keeps them from cutting as many trees as they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Activists also worry that the WTO could eventually target U.S.
laws requiring a certain percentage of recycled material in
government-purchased paper goods, overrule U.S. requirements to
label wood and paper products as ``eco-friendly'' and force the
importation of wood products with invasive pests.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials contend that they will be able to
maintain U.S. laws, although they do acknowledge non-tariff
barriers including environmental laws could well become part of
negotiations once tariffs are killed.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the touchiest possibility raised by this is abolishing
U.S. laws barring the export of logs cut on public property in the
United States. The laws were passed to protect the jobs of U.S.
millworkers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ban has been in place for a decade, Japan considers
it protectionist and has threatened to raise it in negotiations.
Could the ban someday be overturned?
</P>
<P>
   ``That is an open question,'' said a senior Clinton
administration official. ``It is a possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Politically, that poses problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an esoteric concept. This is food on people's
tables in my community,'' said Washington state Rep. Hans Dunshee,
D-Snohomish. ``Those are public trees for a public purpose, and a
public purpose is not sending jobs to Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Washington tree exporters point out that many of their
number are small- to medium-sized family-run operations, and that
exporting trees does provide jobs for dockworkers.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, the Tacoma tree grower and exporter, said being able to
send his best wood overseas for top dollar enables him to afford
environmental protections here. For example, he said, he must agree
not to cut 18 percent of his trees. In a family-run operation such
as his, a drop in profits might force him to sell his land, Murray
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Environmental protections and set-asides are very expensive.
Don't hit me from the other end on price,'' he said. ``You can
drive around and see plenty of places that were forested a month
ago that are growing houses today.''

BILLS KEEP THE PUNCHLESS PATRIOTS IN NOVEMBER FREE FALL
</HEADLINE>

   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. _ A month ago the Patriots were one of the
teams to beat in the American Football Conference East. They raced
out to a 6-2 record and were riding high on a wave of confidence
they felt would carry them into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots team that played Buffalo here Sunday afternoon did
not resemble that squad from four weeks ago. And the Bills
exploited the difference, taking a 17-7 victory in a crucial AFC
East game that puts Buffalo (8-4) in third place in the division
behind Indianapolis (9-2) and Miami (8-3). New England (6-5), loser
of three AFC East games in a row, is now ahead of just the Jets
(4-7) in the division and gasping for air as it tries to make the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go back to work, hang together and create our
offense again, because right now we don't have anything that is
giving us a chance to win football games,'' New England Coach Pete
Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   That lab work will start with quarterback Drew Bledsoe, who is
playing like a gun-shy gunslinger. Bledsoe was sacked six times and
threw one interception against the Bills Sunday. That is an
improvement from his game against the Dolphins last week when he
threw five interceptions and was sacked five times. In the
three-game losing streak, Bledsoe has eight interceptions and has
been sacked 14 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty down,'' Bledsoe said. ``To lose three weeks in a
row and feel like you're ultimately responsible is a very
depressing and disheartening thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bills knew exactly how to make Bledsoe blue. They rushed
five, played bump-and-run, man-to-man coverage on the two outside
receivers and dropped the remaining defenders into zone coverage
deep in the middle. They wanted to limit the big plays by New
England's receivers, particularly Terry Glenn. Buffalo conceded
very little, but what it did give, Bledsoe was not inclined to
take.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw on film that he's holding the ball longer,'' said
Buffalo defensive tackle Ted Washington, who had two sacks. ``He's
trying to make the big play. He's trying to carry the team. He
can't do that. He's trying to be the man. He needs to get help from
the rest of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe completed 18 of 34 for 205 yards and his lone big play
came too late in the game to matter when he hit Glenn on a 45-yard
touchdown pass that made it 17-7 with 2 minutes 41 seconds to play.
He said his recent woes are a combination of his receivers not
getting open quickly and his not being able to get them the ball
quickly enough for them to make plays.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills were not that efficient on offense, either, but they
did enough to win. Buffalo jumped out to a 3-0 lead on a 28-yard
field goal by Steve Christie late in the first quarter. Early in
the second, the Patriots were trying to answer that score when
Bledsoe's pass to Troy Brown was intercepted by Bills cornerback
Ken Irvin at the Buffalo 17-yard line. That was the first New
England scoring chance that was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the second quarter, Bills quarterback Doug Flutie saw
that receiver Eric Moulds had a step on Patriots cornerback Steve
Israel. By the time Flutie released the ball, Israel had slipped at
the Patriots' 40-yard line and Moulds was wide open. He caught the
ball and scored on a 54-yard pass play, which helped give Buffalo a
10-0 lead before the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric got an outside release on him so I tried to lay it up
over him and as I released it the defensive man started to
stumble,'' said Flutie, who was nine of 16 for 207 yards and two
touchdowns with no interceptions. ``I thought I might have
overthrown it, but Eric ran it down and got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Patriots went through a complete remodeling in the
locker room at the half, nothing from the first half suggested that
they had a chance to beat Buffalo in the second half. Late in the
third quarter, Patriots running back Kevin Faulk fumbled at the
Bills' 8 on first-and-goal from the 6-yard line. Buffalo linebacker
Sam Rogers recovered it at the 8.
</P>
<P>
   New England was flat, listless and inept on offense. And when
Bills fullback Sam Gash, a former Patriot, pushed his way past
Patriots linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer on a 31-yard touchdown pass
play to help make it 17-0 with 10:21 remaining in the third
quarter, the New England defense could be placed in the same
category as its offense.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 100th victory of the decade for Buffalo, one of the
most resilient franchises in the National Football League. But it
was bigger than that, particularly in light of the fact that
Buffalo has a bye on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This win puts us in position that it gives us separation from
New England,'' Flutie said. ``It keeps us within striking distance
of the AFC East title. We won't lose next week, but some teams
might.'' &QL;

COMMENTATORS TURN TO GIULIANI FOR DECISION ON SENATE RACE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Armed with Hillary Rodham Clinton's announcement last
week that she is committed to running for the U.S. Senate in New
York next year, commentators on Sunday morning television news
programs and advisers to the first lady sought to turn up the
pressure Sunday on Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to formally declare his
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   With the election nearly a year away, the New York Senate race
continues to dominate the weekend programs on network and cable
television, and on program after program Sunday, commentators
questioned when Giuliani would announce his bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will Rudy Giuliani definitely be a candidate for the U.S.
Senate from New York?'' asked Tim Russert, the host of the NBC
program ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   The commentators were spurred on by the Clinton camp. On
separate programs, Mrs. Clinton's chief political adviser, Harold
Ickes, and a media adviser, Mandy Grunwald, both demanded that
Giuliani state his intentions. Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, Howard
Wolfson, reiterated those demands and issued a news release that
goaded the mayor, asking, ``What is he afraid of?''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Teitelbaum, the director of Giuliani's Senate exploratory
committee, appearing on ``Meet the Press,'' said the mayor would
not be pressured and would make a decision ``in due time.'' But
later in the day, as the chorus grew louder, Teitelbaum said Mrs.
Clinton had been forced to state her plans because of doubts about
her candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been suggested by many people that Mrs. Clinton made her
announcement with her intention to announce because of her
plummeting poll numbers, disarray in her campaign and defections
from her own party,'' he said. ``We don't find ourselves in the
same situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The continuing news media attention to the New York Senate race
is unusual considering that neither Mrs. Clinton, a Democrat, nor
Giuliani, a Republican, is expected to face a primary challenge,
while in the presidential race, highly competitive primaries in
both parties will begin within three months.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Mrs. Clinton nor Giuliani appeared on any of the
programs Sunday, but their surrogates were out in full force,
hammering away at issues like abortion, security for Israel,
campaign finance, health care and negative advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson appeared on ``Fox News Sunday.'' Sen. Robert Torricelli,
D-N.J., supported the first lady on ABC's ``This Week'' while Sen.
Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., went on to speak out for Giuliani.
Teitelbaum appeared with Ms. Grunwald on ``Meet the Press.'' And
Guy Molinari, the Staten Island borough president and close friend
of the mayor's, faced Ickes on ``CNN Live.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nearly every program raised the issue of the first lady's
appearance earlier this month with Suha Arafat, the wife of the
Palestinian Authority president, Yasser Arafat, and Mrs. Clinton's
silence as Mrs. Arafat accused Israel of poisoning Palestinian
women and children with toxic gases. Wolfson defended the first
lady and accused Giuliani's supporters of wanting Mrs. Clinton to
cause a diplomatic debacle by reacting to Mrs. Arafat's comments.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum denied suggesting that Mrs. Clinton should have made
a scene. ``There are times when it is appropriate and even
necessary to stand up and put down that kind of anti-Semitic,
anti-Israel rhetoric,'' he said. ``And the fact is that Mrs.
Clinton failed to respond in a timely and forceful action. Mayor
Giuliani would have acted completely different.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the programs also took up abortion. Although Mrs.
Clinton and Giuliani both favor abortion rights, one question is
whether Giuliani will change his view on a form of late-term
abortion. Giuliani has opposed banning the procedure and has
suggested he will not change that position, but support for a ban
could win him the endorsement of the New York State Conservative
Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor is a very principled person, and right now the mayor
is pro-choice,'' Teitelbaum said. ``He believes in a woman's right
to choose. That's his position, and that's his position and it
hasn't changed, and the mayor believes what he believes in.''

`JACKIE' LOOKS GOOD DESPITE ALL ITS FLAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
JACKIE: BEHIND THE MYTH 
Directed by: Suzanne Bauman 
On: PBS, Monday at 9 p.m. 
Rating: TV-G 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jacqueline Kennedy was just 34 years old when John F. Kennedy
was assassinated, awfully young to be cast as an icon of grief in a
shattering national psychodrama.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that she spent the next three decades trying to
forge an identity beyond the First Widow role that many would have
been happy to see her play indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The patent goal of ``Jackie: Behind the Myth,'' a two-hour
documentary airing at 9 p.m. on PBS, is to remind us that Jackie
went on without Jack, not just raising her two children but
becoming a respected book editor who worked on nearly 100 books
over 16 years, and continuing the passionate advocacy of the arts
that began during her White House years.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers deserve credit for enlarging the lens to
encompass Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis's life, not just the White
House years. Still, any film that promises to get ``behind the
myth'' should make more of an effort to do so, rather than just
enshrine the myth. Ultimately, this is a biography that falls down
the slippery slope into hagiography.
</P>
<P>
   However flawed ``Jackie'' may be as a documentary, though,
there's no denying that Onassis shines as a subject. She had an
idiosyncratic beauty and a little-girl voice that belied a steely
strength. The images of her make this film compulsively watchable
even at its most cloying. Director Suzanne Bauman takes full
advantage of the fact that few public figures have been more
photographed, or more photogenic, than Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   The parade of images includes not just the familiar ones but
pictures of Onassis as a young debutante in Paris, nourishing a
hunger for culture, and wandering through the capital in 1952 as
the ``inquiring photographer'' for the Washington Times-Herald, in
which occupation she met JFK. ``I think I look up to newspaper
people the way you join movie-star fan clubs when you're 10 years
old,'' Onassis said at that time. Chances are her opinion changed
in later life when she became a favorite target of the paparazzi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jackie'' might have benefited from a tough-minded analysis of
the artifice behind the art form Onassis made of public
appearances. (Surely Diana, Princess of Wales, learned a thing or
two from her example.) While the documentary explains how JFK's
widow orchestrated his funeral into a powerfully moving pageant, it
passes over the way she wrapped a posthumous aura of ``Camelot''
around his administration _ defining its image for the ages _ by
telling reporter Theodore White of the slain president's fondness
for the musical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jackie'' does reward viewers with some unstaged moments that
pierce the enigma, as when Onassis, an accomplished equestrienne,
displays unalloyed joy while watching a horse show in Pakistan.
It's easy to see why Parisians were captivated by her after
witnessing her interview with a French TV reporter on the White
House lawn, which she conducted in fluent French, to pave the way
for a trip to France.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of a philandering father, Onassis would go on to
marry a philandering husband. How did she cope with the pain of it?
How did she reconcile her own personal dignity and accomplishment
with the humiliation of being cheated on?
</P>
<P>
   Exploring these questions could offer clues to her character,
but viewers who turn to ``Jackie'' for answers will be
disappointed. The film touches glancingly on the subject of JFK's
infidelities and then skitters away, as if afraid to tamper with
the portrait of martyrdom.
</P>
<P>
   She will, of course, be forever linked to JFK, despite this
documentary's laudable attempt to present a fuller portrait. But
looking at the old black-and-white footage of the White House years
in ``Jackie,'' it is intriguing to see how she seemed less stilted
and more natural when she appeared in public alone, without JFK.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the throat-catching moments are all here: Jackie's
massive dignity in the wake of her husband's murder, and the moment
when that stoicism crumbled as she dropped her head, sobbing, while
his funeral cortege passed by; the picture of the dazed widow
standing next to Lyndon Johnson while he took the presidential
oath; John-John pulling at her pearls, and later, offering that
immortal salute to his father. ``Jackie'' also offers an absorbing
glimpse into the mutual respect between the president's widow and
his successor, LBJ. Her personality is sketched in anecdotes
supplied by such onetime Kennedy aides as John Kenneth Galbraith
and Pierre Salinger, and from musicians Andre Previn and Isaac
Stern.
</P>
<P>
   The film passes quickly over her marriage to Aristotle Onassis,
and does not mention her relationship with New York
journalist/novelist Pete Hamill. The latter seems an odd omission
for a film (produced by WNET in New York) that focuses so intently
on Onassis's years in New York, including a lengthy segment on her
efforts to prevent the construction of an office tower at Grand
Central Station.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear from the testimony of the authors, artists, and
preservationists with whom she worked in the last two decades of
her life that Onassis remained a compelling presence and a loyal
friend. Without question, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was worthy of
great admiration, if not the uncritical worship of this
documentary.

NOW, BROUGHT TO YOU BY COKE OR PEPSI: YOUR CITY HALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y., Mass., Mich.)  (lb) 
 By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. _ Beachgoers who become thirsty while
strolling on this surfing town's pier had better like Coke. Every
vending machine on and around the pier offers only Coca-Cola
beverages.
</P>
<P>
   The selection is just as limited in the city's parks and civic
center. As on all municipal property here, there is little evidence
that Pepsi, Coke's main competitor, even exists.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to raise money, Huntington Beach in February sold
Coca-Cola exclusive rights to soft-drink sales on its property for
nearly $6 million in cash and services in the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That goes a long way in putting grass in the soccer fields for
kids and repainting City Hall,'' said Donald Schulte, president of
the Public Enterprise Group, a consulting company that helped
Huntington Beach negotiate its soft-drink deal. ``None of it would
come from taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a dozen cities across the United States have since
approved similar contracts with soft-drink companies. The largest
to do so is San Diego, where the city council voted in November to
make Pepsi its official soft-drink in exchange for at least $6.7
million in the next 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Soft-drink companies believe that buying rights to city property
is good business for several reasons. In addition to eliminating
competition, they hope the access will allow them to build customer
loyalty and create a sense of good will in the community.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Huntington Beach, a middle-class city of 200,000 in
the Los Angeles suburbs, chose to solicit a soft-drink contract in
an effort to increase revenue and make park improvements. A city
consultant, who has experience selling sporting-event sponsorships,
approached the major soft-drink companies with the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Both Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Southern
California submitted proposals. The city council eventually
approved Coca-Cola's proposal, which offered $300,000 a year in
cash and $300,000 a year for in-kind maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the money, Coca-Cola got exclusive access to
sell its soft drinks, bottled water and juices on three miles of
city beach, 60 parks and a handful of city buildings. The company
can install up to 180 vending machines on city property and use
Huntington Beach's Surf City logo in its advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Green, the mayor, who prefers to drink tea rather than
soft drinks, applauds the deal for helping to balance the city's
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Fears that Coca-Cola would flood the city with unattractive
advertising have proved to be unfounded, he said. In fact, he
added, the agreement prohibits such practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we now have Coca-Cola Pier,'' Green said. ``It
hasn't been intrusive at all. In fact, I haven't noticed it at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Cities are not the first government entities to negotiate
soft-drink rights.
</P>
<P>
   School districts, for example, have been selling soft-drink
companies exclusive access to school property for at least the last
few years.
</P>
<P>
   But bundling all of a city's municipal property for such a
contract is a relatively new phenomenon. Negotiating a deal for a
large territory is more practical for a soft-drink company than
doing business park by park, the soft-drink companies said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The marriage of big business and government worries some
consumer advocates. They complain that sponsorship deals subvert
government oversight of corporations that contribute money to the
community's budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the pragmatic problem of a municipality pushing
a brand that over-caffeinates and over-sugars children,'' said
Jamie Court, advocacy director for the Foundation for Taxpayer and
Consumer Rights in Santa Monica, Calif. ``It's also the symbol that
government can be bought for a small pittance and branded with a
cola company's emblem.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanctioning a company also raises fears of price gouging. Court
said that eliminating competition on city property could allow
soft-drink companies to raise prices.
</P>
<P>
   Whether prices in Huntington Beach have increased since
Coca-Cola eliminated its competition is unclear. For a 20-ounce
Coke, the company charges $1.50 at the beach and $1 at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Phillips, spokesman for Coca-Cola Bottling of Southern
California, based in Los Angeles, said the company always charges
fair prices with or without competition and does not have exclusive
access to the handful of restaurants on city property.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to remember that city property is only a very
small portion of the total land mass of any municipality,''
Phillips said. ``Yes, at this park, there may only be a machine
that carries our products. But you can walk across the street and
buy Pepsi from someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   How much extra revenue is flowing to Coca-Cola because of the
deal is unknown. The company's vending machines at the pier did not
muster a single sale over an hour on a recent cool Friday
afternoon, but they will almost certainly attract more business
during the summer, when the beach is blanketed with thousands of
people.
</P>
<P>
   Cities with outdoor activities are particularly attractive
targets for soft-drink companies looking for an exclusive contract,
said David DeCecco, spokesman for Pepsi-Cola, a unit of PepsiCo,
based in Purchase, N.Y. Residents in such places are more likely to
visit a park and work up a thirst, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we would get as much out of a city in
Saskatchewan as in Southern California,'' DeCecco added.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that northern cities have no chance to enlist
in the soft-drink wars. Pepsi-Cola sponsors Amherst, N.Y., and
Lynn, Mass., while Coke is the official soft drink of East Lansing,
Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Some cities, like San Francisco, are philosophically opposed to
the notion of exclusive soft-drink contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Franciscans tend to be very independent-minded and
promoters of small business,'' said Kandance Bender, spokeswoman
for Mayor Willie Brown. ``I can't imagine that this would be
something that San Francisco would do.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulte, Huntington Beach's consultant, said that the city might
enter into other corporate deals worth millions of dollars a year.
One idea is to sell the exclusive right to install automated teller
machines on municipal property.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, residents and visitors were unaware or did
not care about the city's contract with Coca-Cola. James Gonzales,
a college student who was carrying his surfboard past the vending
machines at the pier simply shrugged when told about the deal and
said: ``Coke or Pepsi, what's the difference?''

<P>
   SEATTLE _ You walk into the grocery store and head for the
seafood case. Shrimp tonight? Sounds good.
</P>
<P>
   Then you remember: There's a fair chance these shrimp were
caught in nets that also drowned endangered sea turtles.
</P>
<P>
   Tuna noodle casserole? Maybe that will have to do. Then you spot
the newly revised ``dolphin-safe'' insignia on the can and remember
that you can't rely on that label anymore. Tuna's out, too.
</P>
<P>
   In the produce section, you long for the days when you could
choose fruit and vegetables that said ``organic.'' Those days are
long gone.
</P>
<P>
   You phone home to ask what the kids want and find there's some
news: Your brother has lost his job at a sawmill downstate. Logs
coming out of the national forest _ once the exclusive province of
domestic mills _ now are being shipped to Japan for processing.
Your brother will need a big loan to tide him over. Maybe dinner
should be rice and beans.
</P>
<P>
   This is a snapshot of the future that environmental activists
predict will come from the liberalized trade rules of the World
Trade Organization. It is a prediction hotly disputed by
free-traders and the Clinton administration, who maintain that so
far, the WTO's effect on the environment has been negligible.
</P>
<P>
   Free-traders say that the best way to encourage
environment-friendly policies around the globe is to boost world
trade, enriching even the poorest nations enough to afford basic
environmental protections. Environmentalists predict a ``race to
the bottom,'' in which all eco-friendly regulations are toppled.
</P>
<P>
   As trade ministers from 135 nations gather in Seattle this week,
Americans cite environmental worries as some of their biggest
misgivings about the WTO, according to a recent University of
Maryland poll of 1,826 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not opposed to trade,'' said Patti Goldman of the
Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund. ``Our complaint is with the rules
this organization has in place. ... The WTO should not be
second-guessing individual governments' decisions about protecting
the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental activists are split into two camps. One, with
Goldman and others in the forefront, wants to reshape WTO rules to
better protect the Earth. A second wing wants to abolish the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of free trade counter that environmental problems the
protesters bring up are largely imagined.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO wants as little as possible to do with environmental
issues, free-traders assert. The WTO only wades in when a member
country complains that another nation is unfairly guarding its
domestic industries. Sometimes that can take the guise of a law
ostensibly protecting the environment or public health, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Environmental standards should be raised. That's an
imperative,'' said Donald Marsh, a trade consultant and faculty
member at Seattle University. ``But we cannot raise them by
restricting trade or imposing sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue does not break neatly along ideological lines. It has
seen Ralph Nader's Public Citizen group advocating the same
positions as Big Steel and Big Oil. It has made political partners
of the Sierra Club and Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   How you view this controversy depends on how you answer several
contentious questions:
</P>
<P>
   How much has the WTO harmed the environment so far?
</P>
<P>
   Activists' opposition to the WTO has focused on decisions handed
down by the organization's dispute-resolution panels, which swing
into action when one country complains about another's trade
policies.
</P>
<P>
   These three-person panels conduct investigations much like an
American court case, with one important distinction: They lack
democratic safeguards that Americans consider routine.
</P>
<P>
   The cases are not heard in public. Environmental groups and
other outsiders are not allowed to clarify their positions. Usually
the panel members are well-versed in trade; there is no requirement
for environmental expertise. Overall, activists say, it reeks of a
Star Chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me make sure this is clear: Three appointed corporate
lawyers, meeting in secret, can invalidate laws passed by Congress
and signed by the president of the United States,'' wrote Denis
Hayes, a founder of Earth Day and of the modern environmental
movement in America.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials say environmental activists are
confusing the potential for harm with actual harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The WTO decisions, at least the ones that the United States
has been involved in, have not weakened environmental
protections,'' said Carol Browner, administrator of the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The three most high-profile environmental cases:
</P>
<P>
   __ In 1996, the WTO ruled that the United States had
discriminated against gasoline from Venezuela and Brazil based on
air-pollution rules. The rules required domestic refiners to show
their gasoline was no dirtier than what they sold in 1990. But
information on foreign gasoline's 1990 pollution levels was
unavailable. So the EPA proposed to force some foreign producers to
sell gasoline that was cleaner than some domestic producers were
permitted to dispense. But facing a WTO challenge, the EPA amended
the rule.
</P>
<P>
   The solution involved sending inspectors overseas to check on
how the gas was being produced _ at taxpayers' expense, with money
taken from EPA's enforcement budget, Goldman said. EPA admitted
that changing the rule brought the ``potential for the quality of
imported gasoline to degrade from an emissions perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   __ In 1998, the WTO ruled against a U.S. ban on imported shrimp
caught in nets that can drown endangered sea turtles. The problem
started when State Department officials decided to apply the rules
only to Caribbean countries, giving them three years to comply and
offering assistance in learning how to use nets with trap-doors
that act as escape hatches for turtles.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists successfully challenged the State Department
in court, saying the law dictated that all countries exporting
shrimp here, not just those in the Caribbean must use the so-called
Turtle Excluder Devices. The State Department gave Asian countries
only four months to start using TEDs, and offered no technical
assistance. The Asians challenged this at the WTO and won. Now the
State Department is trying to work out a shipment-by-shipment
process for certifying that shrimp are turtle-safe _ a process
environmentalists decry as unenforceable.
</P>
<P>
   __ Mexico and the European Union challenged the United States'
ability to exclude tuna caught in purse-seine nets that also scoop
up and kill dolphins. A panel of judges under the GATT agreement
ordered the United States to drop the restrictions. Mexico and
other Latin countries proposed a compromise, a method of fishing in
which the dolphins, once encircled in the nets, are given a chance
to jump out before the tuna are hauled in. They wanted that tuna
labeled ``dolphin-safe.''
</P>
<P>
   That change will go into effect early next year. But as in the
shrimp case, environmentalists reject this as an enforcement
nightmare. A single observer on a tuna boat the size of a football
field is expected to know whether any dolphins are killed or
``seriously injured'' in a net with a circumference of over a mile,
they point out.
</P>
<P>
   The three largest tuna sellers _ Starkist, Chicken of the Sea
and Bumblebee _ have pledged not to sell tuna caught that way, said
Rina Rodriguez of Defenders of Wildlife. Those companies use tuna
caught with methods that steer clear of any damage to dolphins, she
said. But still, the change in U.S. law appears to have affected
the industry, as the number of dolphin deaths related to tuna
fishing is on the rise, Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Are the Clinton administration and WTO really open to
eco-friendly changes in trade rules?
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year the WTO convened a panel on environmental
issues that concluded, ``environmental conditions are worsening
daily and the dialogues within these walls have failed to proceed
quickly enough to stave off damage,'' minutes of the meeting state.
</P>
<P>
   Then last month, the WTO issued a report that made some
surprisingly candid admissions. Example: It rejected the
free-traders' mantra that increasing incomes in developing
countries necessarily leads to more environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all kinds of economic growth are equally benign for the
environment,'' the WTO report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration also turned up the rhetorical volume
in an effort to appease environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has been very clear that it is important to
integrate environment and public-health protection into the WTO,''
said the EPA's Browner in Seattle last month.
</P>
<P>
   But her message was mangled. Form triumphed over substance at
the ``town hall'' in Seattle. What had been billed as dialogue
turned out to be a stilted session of long-winded answers to
written questions. By virtually every account, it was a flop.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials say environmentalists are not
giving them enough credit for fighting an uphill battle for
environmental protections in the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   Activists, though, point out that the United States is the
proverbial 800-pound gorilla in the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has not been a passive victim of these trade
rules,'' said Goldman, of Earthjustice. ``It has been an active
proponent when it has served our economic interests.''
</P>
<P>
   In a final shot at reassuring environmentalists, the
administration this month made what it considered ``a major
announcement.'' Vice President Al Gore, just before hopping on a
plane to leave Seattle, announced that thorough environmental
reviews would be conducted on all proposed trade pacts in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Just more window dressing, environmentalists sniffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's happened because of public pressure for making the
process more democratic, but it's far too little, too late,'' said
Carol Dansereau of the Washington Toxics Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the administration's position is still that it
favors trade over other considerations, at least when it comes to
the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists asked the Clinton administration to push for
WTO rule changes to explicitly protect the environment. But the
administration rejected activists' calls for stronger WTO rules,
saying those already in place are ``fully consistent'' with strong
environmental protections.
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials said they feared that trying to
change WTO rules to give environmental regulators more power would
empower bureaucrats in poorer countries to use environmental
excuses for protectionist trade policies.
</P>
<P>
   In short, they feared that U.S.-based corporations might lose
some business.
</P>
<P>
   How much sovereignty should a nation give up in the name of
trade?
</P>
<P>
   Activists point out that WTO is set up to require countries to
yield a bit of their sovereignty _ that is, their ability to say no
to another nation's goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're for rules _ we just don't have the right rules,'' said
Dan Seligman of the Sierra Club's international trade office.
</P>
<P>
   What the WTO views as discrimination, environmentalists see as
protection, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Environmental regulations intend to, and by design,
discriminate,'' Seligman said. ``That is their purpose. They are
meant to discriminate against polluters and in favor of clean
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Who should have to prove what?
</P>
<P>
   Free-traders point out that the WTO allows countries to
discriminate against products when this is ``necessary to protect
human, animal or plant life or health,'' or if it is ``relating to
the conservation of exhaustible natural resources.'' The condition:
Such restrictions must not be ``arbitrary or unjustifiable.''
</P>
<P>
   These rules did not prevent the United States from obtaining a
WTO ruling against the European Union over a prohibition on the
sale of beef produced with the aid of growth hormones. Studies have
shown a higher incidence of cancer in mice treated with these
hormones. But the WTO ruled there was no credible evidence that
eating beef treated with the hormones was harmful to humans.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists cite this case as proof that the WTO is
abandoning the ``precautionary principle,'' which holds that
regulators should be able to build in a margin of safety when they
are unsure about the facts.
</P>
<P>
   But free-traders say the WTO ruled correctly in the beef-hormone
case. adding that restrictions on trade based on speculative ideas
about safety make would allow protectionists to run wild.
</P>
<P>
   Brink Lindsey of the Cato Institute, a libertarian-leaning think
tank, proposes a compromise: Let goods in, but label them. Let
consumers choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``If consumers are worried about these things _ even if most
scientists say there is nothing substantive to worry about _ it
seems me that labeling is a way to make everybody happy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen, though, whether such an approach would
withstand WTO scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Is the power of the purse a legitimate way to influence policy?
</P>
<P>
   Ever since a group of Irish peasants seeking lower rents quit
doing business with their landlord, a retired English military man
named Lord Charles Boycott, it has grown increasingly common for
consumers to use the same tactics.
</P>
<P>
   More than a century later, American consumers still favor the
boycott tactic. Three-quarters of Americans responding to the
recent University of Maryland poll supported a nation's ability to
restrict imports based on environmental effects of their
production.
</P>
<P>
   Free-traders doubt the effectiveness of a boycott in
international trade.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, questions are being raised about whether such
unilateral actions, even if they are based on international
treaties, are even legal under WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're imposing your environmental values on another
country and making their observations of your norms a condition for
access to your market, the WTO is generally hostile to that,'' said
Lindsey, of Cato.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Canada threatened action against the state of
Minnesota when the state required a threshold of recycled content
in paper it was purchasing. Minnesota backed down.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a contradictory example in WTO case law. An
important but often-overlooked part of the WTO ruling in the
shrimp-turtle case held that it was OK for the United States to
discriminate between shrimp caught in ways that kill sea turtles,
and shrimp caught in ways not likely to hurt the turtles. It's just
that the United States was arbitrary in applying the rules, the WTO
found.
</P>
<P>
   So it remains an open question whether such boycotts will long
be permissible under WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, environmental activists point to developments that
might negate the eco-labeling solution:
</P>
<P>
   __ The European Union has threatened to challenge U.S.
nutritional labeling requirements, and environmentalists wonder
whether ``organic'' labels are far behind.
</P>
<P>
   __ The United States has objected to an EU eco-label for paper
products.
</P>
<P>
   __ The United States challenged an EU requirement for labels on
genetically engineered foods.
</P>
<P>
   The faceoff over trade and the environment will come to a head
here when the Clinton administration pushes a small part of the
environmentalists' agenda: for the WTO to open up its processes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agree that the WTO is more closed than it ought to be,''
said Havercamp, the assistant U.S. trade representative. ``We feel
that the viability of the institution is threatened if it doesn't
become more open.''
</P>
<P>
   How far this goes will depend on other members of the WTO. This
``transparency agenda,'' as it is called, already is meeting
resistance from the European Union and poor countries, U.S.
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Said Hayes, the Earth Day founder: ``A safe, healthy environment
_ that's not a right that is enshrined in the Constitution, but
politicians who have ignored it have done so at their peril. And
so, too, may international trade negotiators ignore it at their
peril.''

IDAHO CHRISTIANS RALLY ROUND A CROSS ON A HILL

<P>
   BOISE, Idaho _ For 43 years, a 60-foot white cross has stood
like a Christian beacon on the eastern skyline of this city.
</P>
<P>
   Lighted at night, the cross looms 1,000 feet over Boise atop a
bluff called Table Rock. On any given day, Christians visit the
cross to pray, sing or shout hallelujah to the setting sun.
</P>
<P>
   No one objected when the Idaho Jaycees built the cross on public
land in 1956. To avoid a potential constitutional challenge from
the American Civil Liberties Union, the Jaycees bought the tiny
spit of land on which the cross sits for $100 in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago Rob Sherman, a Chicago talk-radio host and an
atheist, ignited a passionate debate here in a speech to Idaho
atheists by suggesting that the land transaction was rigged and
that a federal lawsuit should be filed to bring down the cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's blatantly unconstitutional,'' said Sherman, a former
spokesman for the American Atheists Inc., a nonprofit group that
promotes separation of church and state. ``Whenever government
editorializes about religion by putting a religious symbol on
public land, it creates a climate of bigotry, intolerance, hatred
and tyranny against non-Christians in general and against atheists
in particular.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman's statements galvanized an outpouring of support for the
cross.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday afternoon, the police said, 10,000 people marched
down Capitol Boulevard carrying ``Save the Cross'' signs and
singing religious music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a symbol of peace, and at night it's real
pretty,'' said Laura Hogan, 10, of Boise.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians have seized the issue as a political opportunity in
a largely conservative state.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Butch Otter, a Republican who is running for the House
seat being vacated by Rep. Helen Chenoweth, R-Idaho, said at
Saturday's rally that the cross was protected because it was on
private property.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to build a church, if you want to start a
religion, go get yourself a piece of private property,'' Otter
said. ``That's how it is, and that's the way it should be, and
that's the way that cross is up on that hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Dirk Kempthorne, a Republican, pledged to support the
cross, as did Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ``The separation of church and state was never intended to
suggest or promote atheism,'' Kempthorne wrote in a Nov. 23 letter
to the Jaycees.
</P>
<P>
   In Rocky Mountain political terms, Sherman has hit two hot
buttons: Westerners do not take kindly to outsiders telling them
what to do, and property rights are considered sacrosanct here.
</P>
<P>
   Letters to the editor in local newspapers have been running
10-to-1 in support of the cross. Talk radio stations have buzzed
with irate callers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Larry Butler, a truck driver, got so mad when Sherman challenged
the cross that he has used donated lumber to make and distribute
7,000 small crosses. ``I'm going to be a thorn in Rob Sherman's
side from now on,'' Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   A few opponents have politely noted that the cross is not a
universal religious symbol. ``Regardless of the legalities of the
case, Boiseans should know that for a minority of its citizens, the
everyday sight of that cross is highly distressing,'' said Martin
Seidenfeld, who has lived in Boise for 28 years.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cronin, a new Boise resident who recently worked at the
Jaycees' world headquarters in Miami, says the Idaho Jaycees ought
to reconsider. ``For Buddhists, Jews, Muslims and other
non-Christians in Boise,'' Cronin said, ``the cross only drives
home the point that they are strangers in a strange land.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the issues of diversity and tolerance have been on the
front burner in Boise lately. Corporations like Hewlett Packard and
Micron Technology have expressed concern about their ability to
recruit workers, because Idaho is sometimes seen as a refuge for
white supremacists and racists.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is not limited to Idaho. American Atheists Inc. is
challenging a 109-foot cross on Mount Davidson near San Francisco.
A cross on public land in Eugene, Ore., has already been removed
after a challenge by the ACLU.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jaycees here vowed to stand their ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our cross,'' said Eric Landaluce, president of the
Idaho Jaycees. ``I challenge Rob Sherman to take this all the way
to the Supreme Court.''

COMMENTARY: JEREMIAH SPEAKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARPERS FERRY, W.Va. _ In changing around the clothes in my
closet to get ready for winter, I made a dismaying discovery: I
have 38 shirts.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of person needs 38 shirts? I am not a clothes horse,
much less a shirt freak. Even after subtracting the purple
polyester corduroy given to me that I would not be caught dead in,
that leaves more shirts than a man can wear in a month.
</P>
<P>
   My first reaction is defensive. What's wrong with having a vast
assortment of shirts? I make a good living; the good times are
rolling. So what if there's no more room on my shelves? That means
only that it's time to build more shelving.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, my shirt acquisition program makes me an
economy-driving consumer. This adds to the profits of Van Heusen or
Brooks Brothers, thereby raising the stock value of America's
pension funds and putting rice in the mouths of impoverished
Malaysians who sew on the sleeves. Spending can thus be justified
as a virtue, even when it buys the unneeded.
</P>
<P>
   Muttering the millennial mantra, ``Spendthriftiness is next to
godliness,'' I went to the factory-outlet mall in Hagerstown, Md.
There, on Thanks-for-your-patronage Weekend, consumer consummation
was rife. Hordes of buyers lined up to snatch items reduced from
``list prices'' that only fools in department stores pay.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by my value-savvy family, I experienced the thrill
of the bargain hunt. Nine West and Timberland shoes went for a
pittance; Ralph Lauren suits from only last season were swept off a
clearance rack; Donna Karan cashmere sweaters that hung down to the
ankles were offered in all their dark-gray glory for a measly 99
bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Every plastic-carded purchase seemed to be vengeance against the
evil forces of ``list.'' To get an early-bird reduction from the
sale price _ with 50 percent off for the second pair of unneeded
whatever _ was a buyer's bliss.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, and yet. Standing here in the epicenter of
pre-Christmasism, laden with shopping bags of merchandise that
proved my worth both as a provider and as a conspicuous consumer, a
nagging thought rooted in the dim past intrudes: Is this the way I
want to spend my leisure time? What kind of cheap triumph is a
cheap sweater? Who needs all this stuff anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Never say ``piffle'' to an epiphany. Today's rush to buy is not
yesterday's addiction to acquisition. We have gone past that lust
for possessions that motivated the misers of yesteryear. Greed is
no longer the game; in our time, shopping has become the primary
form of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   So here we are in the Age of Shoppertainment. What we buy and
wear merges with what we see and hear; this great blob of
self-absorption and inter-amusement takes up our time and occupies
our minds. The moving finger writes the message on the T-shirt: To
fill the shopping cart is to fulfill oneself.
</P>
<P>
   The philosophy of the shoppertainers holds that the act of
spending and not the object acquired is the source of fun. In the
past, the poet worried that ``getting and spending, we lay waste
our powers,'' but as the getting gets easier, it's the spending
that gives us the kick.
</P>
<P>
   You can shop the world, but I want to get off. Mall mania may be
the marketing majority's way of living, but it's no way of life.
Doing the outlet center does not stimulate the mind or recreate the
body or satisfy the soul.
</P>
<P>
   The modern Jeremiah asks: As you snatch the merchandise off the
shelf, are you learning something, or _ just as important _ are you
teaching anything? The money you spend today you might remake
tomorrow, but the time you spend spending can never be bought back.
</P>
<P>
   Worry not, the sensual sybarites of suburbia assure us, the
malls and the factory-outlet centers are transitory. Coming
generations will turn to the virtual virtues of Internet intellect,
and knowledge and art will be the intercourse most desired.
</P>
<P>
   But do you know what our offspring are already doing on that
brave new medium? They say they are ``engaged in e-commerce,'' but
what they are doing is amusing themselves shopping.
</P>
<P>
   This Jeremiah sees that future and it works all too well. Picked
up a couple of nice shirts, though.

COMMENTARY: BULLYING THE HOMELESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Away from the parade, hunched in doorways or curled
up in boxes soggy from the steady rain, the street people passed
the Thanksgiving holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Some were lucky enough to catch a meal at a soup kitchen. Some
reaped a small bonanza in donations from passers-by in a holiday
mood. But others, less fortunate, were rousted and handcuffed and
taken away to jail.
</P>
<P>
   New York's current mayor, as cold a politician as you'll ever
see, has chosen this moment in the city's history, this moment of
great prosperity and good cheer, to sic the police on the homeless.
So on the day after Thanksgiving, you had the following headline in
Newsday: ``Arrests Feed Anger of Homeless.'' And in the Daily News:
``The mayor targets us like prey, say needy.''
</P>
<P>
   And even in The Post, as good a friend as the mayor is likely to
find, you had a homeless man named Harry Reynolds quoted as saying:
``It's a shame! I'm not on crack. I'm not mentally ill. I just
could not afford to pay rent.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph Giuliani's latest approach to the devastating problem of
homelessness is not just cruel, it's incoherent. A month ago he was
threatening to throw people out of the homeless shelters and onto
the streets if they refused to work. Now he's got the police
arresting people who are on the streets for refusing to go to a
shelter.
</P>
<P>
   This is not policy-making. This is not a reasoned attempt to
deal with a complex problem. It's a mayor with a whip lashing out
blindly at some of the weakest, most troubled people in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those arrested are back on the streets a day later, back
to the cardboard box or the dark alley or the tiny corner of a park
that they've turned into a wretched approximation of home. I doubt
that a night in jail has made them any wiser, or the city any
safer. What it does, according to homeless advocates, is make the
street people a lot more frightened. Perhaps the mayor, who has
bullied people throughout his public career, thinks that's just
what they deserve.
</P>
<P>
   This official assault on the homeless is the mayor's response to
the attack on Nicole Barrett, who was almost killed by a man who
smashed her skull with a paving stone at a midtown intersection on
Nov. 16. Witnesses said the man might have been homeless, and it is
generally assumed he was mentally ill. New Yorkers were both
chilled and saddened by the apparently random attack, and many were
angered. But there is no sense that the public supports an
arbitrary crackdown on the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   A poll by New York 1 News last week found that 77 percent of
respondents opposed the arrest of homeless people who refuse
shelter. And several members of the clergy have let it be known
that they do not want the police to disturb homeless people who
seek refuge outside their churches.
</P>
<P>
   The Church of the Holy Apostles on Ninth Avenue in the Chelsea
section of Manhattan, which runs the city's largest soup kitchen,
was especially vehement in its response to the mayor's actions. It
issued a public statement that assailed the mayor's
``mean-spiritedness'' and asserted: ``The policy of attacking the
most vulnerable of our city in the midst of an economic boom for
the majority is unworthy of the values we celebrate this holiday.
This is another instance of `criminalizing' the homeless, not for
what they have actually done, but for simply who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Homeless advocates have reacted bitterly to the mayor's
crackdown. ``There is no logic here,'' said Mary Brosnahan of the
Coalition for the Homeless. ``It runs counter to everything we've
learned over the past 20 years about how to help the homeless. The
solution is to have legitimate outreach, not outreach with a
sidearm.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani himself has long said he agreed with advocates that the
way to help the homeless who are mentally ill is to get them into
community-based mental health facilities _ residences in which
troubled individuals can receive the services and medication they
need.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of difficult but worthy effort is the opposite of
throwing the homeless in jail.
</P>
<P>
   With his police force at the ready, the mayor now says, ``We're
going to spend a lot of time removing homeless people from the
streets.'' And he speaks contemptuously of those who truly want to
help the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The problem may be complex, but the current policy of the
current mayor is a cold and simple one: Cuff 'em, and lock 'em up.

GIANTS' VAUNTED DEFENSE HUMBLED IN 34-24 LOSS TO ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Jim Fassel, the New York Giants' coach,
said he was disappointed and accepted blame. Michael Strahan, the
defensive end, said he was shocked. Kerry Collins, the new
quarterback, said he was discouraged and encouraged. Jessie
Armstead, the talkative linebacker, spoke loudly with his absence,
leaving Giants Stadium without comment. Sam Garnes, the strong
safety, said what he saw was ``totally ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   After the most disheartening regular-season loss in Fassel's
Giants tenure, there was no shortage of opinion or angst Sunday in
the Giants' locker room.
</P>
<P>
   An Arizona Cardinals team with the third worst offense in the
National Football League pushed around the haughty Giants defense,
amassing Arizona's highest point total ever in Giants Stadium. The
Giants' offense blundered its way to four turnovers. A tight,
3-point game in the fourth quarter became a numbing 34-24 Cardinals
rout, a defeat that so dims the Giants' playoff chances that they
are drifting toward the fantasy category.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-6 Giants, who at the midpoint of their season were
first-place contenders, have lost three consecutive games just as
their schedule grows more daunting. After a distracting week that
included a quarterback change, a holiday and the death of Fassel's
mother, the Giants played Sunday without poise or skill on either
side of the ball, a combination that has the team reeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am still trying to figure it out,'' Strahan said. ``I don't
know how in the world they scored 34 points. I don't see how it
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants lost to the Cardinals at home for just the second
time in 16 years and was swept in the two-game season series
between the teams for the first time in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   With Collins at quarterback the Giants scored more points
Sunday, but the Giants' defenders, who just a week ago were
critical of the team's lack of offensive output, allowed the
Cardinals (5-6) and their spellbinding quarterback Jake Plummer to
steal the game.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer replaced the former Giant quarterback Dave Brown in the
second half and threw for two touchdowns while completing 12 of 18
passes without an interception. Most conspicuously, Plummer and the
Cardinals went after Giants cornerback Phillippi Sparks six times,
and completed a pass each time.
</P>
<P>
   Still, midway through the final quarter, after Collins led the
Giants on an impressive 13-play, 88-yard touchdown drive, Arizona's
lead was just 20-17.
</P>
<P>
   Needing a pivotal stop, the Giants' defense, which has talked of
being among the league's elite, stumbled at the worst possible
time. First, it gave up an 11-yard completion from Plummer to Frank
Sanders on a third-and-8 play _ with Giants cornerback Jason Sehorn
just missing an attempt to bat away the pass. On the next down, the
Giants blitzed from Plummer's left, but the shifty quarterback was
already looking to his right, where he had called for a screen
pass.
</P>
<P>
   When Plummer found running back Adrian Murrell in the flat,
there was no Giant in his path for 20 yards. The play gained 23
yards, and five plays later Mario Bates scored on a 2-yard run that
gave the Cardinals a 10-point lead with 4 minutes 16 seconds left
in the game. The teams traded meaningless touchdowns but Arizona's
lead was never seriously threatened.
</P>
<P>
   As porous as the Giants defense looked at game's end, to be
fair, they may have been exhausted from playing all but 3:09 of the
third quarter. Because if the Giants defense lost its chance to aid
the cause in the fourth quarter, the Giants offense squandered its
opportunity in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, starting his first game at Giants Stadium, had opened
the game nervous and hurrying his passes as he completed just 1 of
9. But in the second quarter, Collins connected on 10 of 13 passes
for 141 yards. He scored on a 1-yard touchdown run after an 11-play
drive and moved the Giants 66 yards in less than two minutes as the
Giants took a 10-6 lead on a 24-yard field goal by Cary Blanchard
with six seconds left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Collins had provided hope, if for no other reason than the
promise of talent, his 33-yard pass to Ike Hilliard in the second
quarter _ perfectly thrown over one defender and in front of
another to a streaking Hilliard _ had the Giants Stadium crowd on
its feet cheering the Giants offense, something it hasn't done in
months.
</P>
<P>
   This display might have moved Fassel to try to run away with the
game in the third quarter. Sunday's game was played in blustery
conditions, the wind blowing from east to west across the stadium.
Given the option of taking the wind in the third or final quarter,
Fassel took it in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But Collins' first pass of the second half was deflected and
intercepted by Arizona's Rob Frederickson _ the first Arizona
interception in 21 quarters of play. Plummer turned this into a
touchdown when he threw to wide receiver Rob Moore, who took the
football out of the hands of Sparks in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   On the Giants' next possession, Collins, who completed 22 of 45
passes for 298 yards, scrambled to his right looking for a receiver
when he was sacked from behind by Simeon Rice, who had another
field day running around the Giants left tackle Roman Oben. Rice
stripped Collins of the football and recovered the fumble.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Giants drives in the third quarter lasted no more than
three plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking the wind in the third quarter backfired on us
completely,'' Fassel said. ``It was probably the thing that hurt us
the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel, who on Monday was scheduled to fly to California for his
mother's funeral, seemed to be taking Sunday's loss particularly
hard. Asked to describe his feelings as he prepared the team this
weekend, Fassel said:
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been difficult to keep my focus. There has been a lot
going on in my mind. Obviously, I didn't do a good enough job for
this team to go out and play. Obviously, it's been a tough week.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fassel wasn't alone when it came to taking blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly can't say anything about the offense when they
score 24 points,'' Garnes said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Collins: ``We made some nice plays, but I was also sloppy
with the ball and we can't win like that. So I feel encouraged and
I feel exasperated.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Giants, improving on last year's 8-8 record, making the
playoffs, even Fassel's future with the franchise, now hinges on
the final five games _ three of them road games at Buffalo, St.
Louis and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be honest,'' Collins said of the Giants' playoff
chances. ``We're probably going to have to win them all.''

SPORTS COLUMN: GIANTS ARE GETTING WHAT THEY PAID FOR
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Late Sunday afternoon Wellington Mara
stood in a New York Giants locker room soaked in gloom and
disappointment after a 34-24 thrashing by the Arizona Cardinals.
The loss sunk the Giants to 5-6. But for playing in a miserable
division, the loss would have ended the Giants' playoff hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Mara, who turned 83 in August, is a good person to talk to at
times like these, times when the ship is sinking, despair is
descending. He always has the same unflappable expression, a
bemused smile _ sometimes happier, sometimes a bit more pained,
always barely discernible. He has seen so many highs and lows with
this franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Mara was 9 years old when Jim Thorpe lined up for the Giants'
inaugural game against the Providence Steam Rollers in 1925. In the
intervening decades, the Giants have won 17 division titles and six
National Football League championships.
</P>
<P>
   But the past three seasons have been rough. Jim Fassel, the
Giants' head coach since 1997, has been pummeled by the news media.
After a surprisingly good first season in 1997 _ a 10-5-1 record
and a playoff berth _ he has presided over a listless offense.
Touted as a quarterback doctor, Fassel has been unable to mold a
quarterback to provide a spark: Dave Brown, Danny Kanell, Kent
Graham and now Kerry Collins have revealed one fatal flaw after
another.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after a 23-13 loss to Washington, the Giants' defense
lashed out at the offense for failing to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday the defense was thrashed by Arizona, on the ground and in
the air. After the game, the defense was contrite, the offense
subdued.
</P>
<P>
   But longtime Giants fans realized _ probably a few games back,
maybe months ago _ that the Giants' problems in this 75th season
run deeper than an internecine feud between the offense and
defense, deeper even than whether Fassel should stay or go.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is the hierarchy's failure _ or fear _ of matching
the strength of leadership with the depth and strength of its
organization. The Giants' success was engineered by coaches with
dominant personalities and vision and the Giants' willingness to
seek them out, hire them, give them latitude.
</P>
<P>
   Lately the Giants in the ivory tower have clung to control, have
lost the force behind their foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Mara's eyes twinkled when the names of Steve Owen and
Jim Lee Howell were invoked. Owen coached the Giants for 23 full
seasons, 1930 to '53. His 153 victories are the most of any Giants
coach. He was the captain of the 1927 championship team. More than
that, Owen realized in the early 1950s, when his team was still
running a single-wing offense, that it was time to switch to the
new T formation. He hired Allie Sherman as a coach to teach the
team the new offense.
</P>
<P>
   Howell coached from 1954 to 1960 and led the Giants to a league
championship and three division titles. ``He had such great
manners, you'd never guess he was a Marine company commander,''
Mara said. ``He was tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Parcells rescued the Giants after two decades of
mediocrity. His 77-49 record puts him second in victories to Owen.
Parcells took the Giants to Super Bowl victories in 1986 and '90.
He walked away when the Giants were unwilling to cede greater
control of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Reeves rebuilt a crumbling franchise left by Ray Handley.
Reeves left after the 1996 season, also as a result of struggle,
less over power than control.
</P>
<P>
   The parting with Reeves was so nasty that it seems the franchise
was determined not to hire a dominant personality to replace him.
In this respect the Giants are no different from any other
corporate culture. Managers subconsciously hire those who defer,
who won't challenge, won't resist.
</P>
<P>
   After Reeves resigned, the Giants desperately wanted Nick Saban
of Michigan State. In Saban the Giants saw the fiery young coach of
its future. In the Giants Saban probably saw a franchise unwilling
to yield the control he would need to be successful. The Giants
lost Parcells. Lost Reeves. Lost Saban. They settled for Fassel.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel just wanted to be a head coach. Did not want to grab
power, did not want control. Just wanted a chance to do whatever
the organization wanted him to do.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of winning, the organization is not sure what it wants
to do, and, outside of some vague notion of developing a
high-powered offense, how to do it. The Giants touted the fact that
Fassel was an offensive innovator. He doesn't have the offense with
which to innovate. The Giants have not supplied him with the power.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a call for the Giants to fire the coach: Fassel is a
river that the Giants will have to let run its course. When the
river is through, they should look at their history. The Giants'
foundation is too solid to be damaged by the strength of a coach's
personality. The franchise is more likely to be done in by a
captain so willing to please that he won't deviate from a
disastrous course.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Owen was smart enough to switch from the single wing to
the T formation. Jim Lee Howell oversaw the flex defense. Howell
and Owen, strong personalities, did not destroy the Giants'
foundation. ``They were part of the foundation,'' Mara agreed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 the Giants were more interested in a coach who would
genuflect than a coach who might forge a new path and needed added
power do it.
</P>
<P>
   Now they pay.

   FORT LEWIS, Wash. _ In the small world of senior women officers,
Lois Beard was considered a prime candidate to become the Army's
first General Mom.
</P>
<P>
   She was a veteran of the invasion of Panama and the war in the
Persian Gulf. She commanded a military police battalion that helped
keep the peace in Bosnia. The Army promoted her to colonel's rank
two years ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   On top of her typical 12-hour workday, Colonel Beard, 45, was
the mother of three children, raising them with her husband, Glenn,
another Army colonel.
</P>
<P>
   Youthful-looking and energetic, with an officer's unflappable
discipline, she seemed headed toward becoming the first mother
promoted to Army general.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone could do it, Lois could,'' said Col. Stephanie
Hoehne, the spokeswoman for Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO commander.
</P>
<P>
   But then Colonel Beard called it quits and retired. After
holding every job and attending every school required to be
selected as general, she decided she could no longer be both a
mother and a commander.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly would have kept going if it wasn't for the
family,'' she said. ``I loved being a commander, but I found myself
saying I would be a better commander if I wasn't a parent and a
better parent if I wasn't a commander.''
</P>
<P>
   Her teen-age daughters had seemed to be withdrawing from her,
she said, and she feared she ``was taking myself out of my
children's lives.'' Rachel, her 16-year-old daughter, said that
while she missed both parents when they were away from home, she
saved her ire for her mother, not her father.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just made me angry when she came home and asked me what I
had been doing,'' Rachel said. ``I wouldn't answer. I'd only say to
myself, `You weren't there when I needed you, so why should I talk
to you now?'''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the subjects that preoccupy women rising through the
ranks, few are more pressing than how to balance motherhood with
the all-consuming commitment required to become a general or an
admiral. If the corporate world has a glass ceiling, women in the
military say the Pentagon has a brass ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing in my whole career that has caused me the
greatest stress and over which I have had the least control is the
care of my children,'' Colonel Hoehne said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 37 women are active-duty generals or admirals. The Army
has yet to promote a mother to general. The Navy has promoted three
mothers to admiral, but they are all in the special medical or
support branches. The Air Force has one mother who is a general,
but an official said privacy rules prohibited him from identifying
her.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a quarter century after the military academies first
admitted women, the angst and frustration of raising children is
proving to be a major _ and predominantly female _ obstacle for
women on the road to military success.
</P>
<P>
   When the Army recently asked soldiers why they were leaving the
service, women, regardless of their rank, put time away from their
families as their overriding concern.
</P>
<P>
   Men, on the other hand, were evenly divided among complaints
about their pay, job security, possibilities of advancement and
enjoyment of their work. Separation from their children was not
foremost in their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the unnoticed secret of the military,'' said Charles
Moskos, a military sociologist at Northwestern University. ``Senior
women officers who are mothers are strained beyond the limits.
Whether it is genetic or cultural, women are more bonded to their
children than men. They are caught in a double bind that men in the
military don't recognize, much less understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Col. Nancy Bickford, a 44-year-old Army logistics expert and
mother of two children, was caught in that bind. She passed up
several steps necessary for promotion, because of her family. First
she deferred a battalion command when her husband, who was also in
the Army, was not given an appointment at the same post in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a pretty traumatic experience,'' Colonel Bickford
said, ``but I wasn't going to abandon my family.''
</P>
<P>
   She was given a second chance and commanded 800 soldiers in a
battalion at Fort Lewis. But then she passed up the Army War
College, again for family reasons. That spelled the end for further
advancement. Next summer she is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very hard to leave the Army,'' Colonel
Bickford said. ``It's been a challenging career and you get a huge
sense of accomplishment, but ever since I had kids, I've felt the
pull in the other direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of the 3,628 Army colonels on active duty, only 68, or 1.8
percent, are women on the competitive track to move up to the next
step, which is general officer, according to the Army.
</P>
<P>
   While a Pentagon report released in November showed that the
number of minority and women officers has doubled in the past 20
years, women leave the services earlier than men. Among their
complaints is the sense that women are held to a higher standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of talent is being lost this way,'' said Moskos, who
often consults for the armed services. ``The military shouldn't be
losing these women.''
</P>
<P>
   For women on the intricate obstacle course of promotion,
marriage and pregnancy are barriers to be approached with caution.
</P>
<P>
   Colonel Beard married in 1978, when she and her husband led
military police platoons and were heading for new assignments in
Germany. It had been only two years since the Army threw out its
policy requiring pregnant women to leave the service.
</P>
<P>
   After careful consideration, Lois Beard waited until she was
assigned to a professional school in Kansas before becoming
pregnant in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men treat you differently when you're pregnant, asking whether
you really can do those push-ups and whether you should take that
trip,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983 she gave birth to Rachel, and two years later, when she
was in another sedentary job, she gave birth to Megan.
</P>
<P>
   She was worried as much about the Army as about herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can not be in a command position, leading soldiers, when
you are pregnant,'' she said. ``It doesn't work for you or the
soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Defense resists the idea that being a mother
is a disadvantage for a woman climbing to the uppermost levels,
although senior officials acknowledge that women's family choices
can have an effect on their career choices. Except for maternity
leave, official family policy is the same for men and women.
</P>
<P>
   Until she retired, Colonel Beard always made the choice in favor
of promotion, even after her son, Ryan, was born in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   She hired nannies. ``At first, with my salary, I could only pay
for the nanny and groceries. Glenn paid the other bills,'' she
said. ``But nannies are a necessity, not a luxury, with the demands
the military puts on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Her normal routine began with physical training at 6:30 in the
morning and ended at 7 at night. In command positions she was on
call 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   She tried to fit the children into her schedule by working what
her daughter called ``crazy hours.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She would work all day, pick us up at school, make dinner and
then go back to work after we were asleep,'' Rachel said. ``She
wasn't here on weekends much.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some women officers have solved that dilemma by leaving their
families behind for years.
</P>
<P>
   Colonel Hoehne, the public affairs officer, moved by herself to
Washington for a demanding three-year job at the Pentagon, while
her husband, John, stayed behind with their two children in
Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why uproot them and move everybody so Mom can basically
disappear in her work?'' she asked. ``For me, it was a lonely three
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Colonel Hoehne decided not to sacrifice her family
life anymore. After moving to Europe, she dropped a correspondence
course for the Army War College to spend weekends with her
children, throwing away any chance at the top echelon.
</P>
<P>
   Recent Pentagon statistics show that married men and single
women are by far the most likely to make senior ranks of the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason marriage is almost seen as a liability for a
woman, because she will have to spend time with her family,'' said
Lt. Col. Margaret Flott, an Army spokeswoman. ``But I do not think
that is unique to the Army.''
</P>
<P>
   But unlike her civilian counterparts, the military mother
frequently faces overseas deployments.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Col. Lois Beard was sent for four months to Panama. Ten
days after she returned, she was sent to St. Croix, V.I., for two
months. Then in October 1990, she and her husband were ordered to
Saudi Arabia for the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the hardest thing I've ever done in the Army,'' she
said. ``I was 36 years old and didn't know when I would see them
again.''
</P>
<P>
   After putting together all the family photograph albums, Colonel
Beard sat down and wrote a 12-page letter to be opened by her
children upon her death. In it she explained that fulfilling her
responsibilities as an Army officer did not mean she placed her
career above her children.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't return, I didn't want them to grow up thinking the
Army was more important to me than they were,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then she and her husband left for nine months.
</P>
<P>
   The three children were sent to live with an aunt. Rachel, then
7 years old, remembers that she ``did not understand what was going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wondered why the three of us had to be without our
parents,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When the family was reunited, Colonel Beard tried to make up for
her absence by leading a Girl Scout troop while serving as public
affairs officer to the secretary of the Army. That lasted for a few
years before she and her husband were given battalion commands in
Germany. When the Bosnia peacekeeping operation began in 1995, they
were both ordered into the field and the children were left behind
in Mannheim in the care of a nanny.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a lot harder,'' said Rachel, who was a young teenager
then. ``I really needed my parents around and they weren't there.
It was worse for my sister. She got really quiet when they were
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   After three months, Col. Lois Beard returned to Germany while
her husband remained in Bosnia. At that moment, the Army promoted
her two years ahead of schedule, offering her command of a brigade
with 900 soldiers at Fort Lewis and marking her as an officer on
the fast track.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about the children, Colonel Beard spent a long night
debating the promotion with her husband before she decided to
accept the challenge. ``It was gut-wrenching,'' she said, ``but I
decided I had made too much of a commitment to the Army.''
</P>
<P>
   At the top of her game, Colonel Beard moved her family here. Her
husband integrated the Officers' Wives Club, forcing a name change
to the Officers' Spouses Club. Her children were happy at school.
</P>
<P>
   And then she discovered she could not do it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three things happened at once,'' she said. ``The job was
all-encompassing, which is why I loved it. The children needed me
more. And I got older. I don't have the resilience I used to have.
I need sleep.''

`PROFESSOR' ASHLEY MONTAGU, 94, POPULARIZER OF SCIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ashley Montagu, the London-born anthropologist and popular
author whose energy, erudition and showmanship brought genetics,
paleontology and other topics in the life sciences to a wide
American audience, died Friday in Princeton, N.J. He was 94.
</P>
<P>
   The author of more than 60 books, Montagu recently completed a
substantial revision, published this year, of his influential 1953
book, ``The Natural Superiority of Women,'' and was collaborating
with his biographer, Susan Sperling, when he was hospitalized in
March. He died of protracted cardiovascular disease, Ms. Sperling
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Montagu's wide-ranging career as a freelance commentator on
nearly everything human, along with his white hair, owlish glasses
and pipe, made him the public picture of the professor in the 1950s
and 1960s. But despite a voluminous production of scholarly works,
he was unable to win tenure at any of the universities where he
taught, according to Ms. Sperling. That slight was due, in part, to
his ideas about the equality of the races and the sexes, which were
startling for their day, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Montagu wrote books on anthropology, human anatomy,
intelligence, marriage, why people cry and the history of swearing,
as well as an account of John Merrick, the severely disfigured man
of Victorian England known as the ``Elephant Man.'' His commentary
extended even to the prehistoric. He bristled at the cartoon
depiction of Neanderthal men as brutes who clubbed their women over
the head, and would dash off a scathing letter to the editor
whenever he read such a depiction, which he said ignored evidence
of the essential gentleness of Neanderthals.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Henrika Kuklick, a University of Pennsylvania professor of the
sociology of science, said Montagu was ``someone who bridged the
academic and the popular. His works were both accessible and
academically respectable.'' Ms. Kuklick, author of ``The Savage
Within: The Social History of British Anthropology, 1885-1945''
(Cambridge University Press, 1991), added that ``as a public
intellectual, he ranks below Margaret Mead, but far above many
others who I won't name.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Marks, who teaches biological anthropology at the
University of California, noted that Montagu's interests included
genetics and anatomy, a range that would be nearly impossible in
today's academia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and Max Levitan wrote a standard textbook on human genetics
that was used into the late 1970s, even though Montagu's original
training was in anatomy,'' said Marks. ``It's as if you could write
equally well about architecture and the detailed mixing of
concrete.''

<P>
   Montague Francis Ashley Montagu was born Israel Ehrenberg on
June 28, 1905, in the East End, or largely working-class section,
of London. In previous biographical articles, Montagu apparently
said or made it known that he was the son of a stockbroker in the
City of London, the financial district, but his father was really a
tailor, a Polish-born Jew, and his mother a Russian-born Jew,
according to Ms. Sperling. Although an agnostic, Montagu later
acknowledged his Jewish heritage. He took his last name after Lady
Mary Montagu, an 18th century woman of letters and feminist, and
the other parts of his name after other writers he admired, Ms.
Sperling said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why exactly he changed his name,'' Ms. Sperling
said. ``He was ambitious to do great things and as Israel, well,
that would have been an impediment in British academia.''
</P>
<P>
   The classic autodidact, Montagu as a teenager puzzled his
parents by visiting London's used-book stores and buying
second-hand copies of challenging authors like Thomas Henry Huxley,
the British biologist who championed Darwin. At 15, he won a
literary contest and selected William McDougall's ``Introduction to
Social Psychology'' as his prize. He was perhaps the first
undergraduate to study physical anthropology at the University of
London.
</P>
<P>
   He pursued his graduate studies at Columbia University in 1927,
interrupting his studies there to work in ethnology and
anthropology in Italy and physical anthropology at a medical museum
in London. He got his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1937 after studying
under pioneers of anthropology like Franz Boas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, he told an interviewer that the United States had had a
profound effect on him. ``I was brought up a stuffed-shirt
Englishman. I wasn't very human. What America did for me was to
humanize me. Democratize me, beginning with the man who examined my
luggage on the dock in 1927. He didn't call me `sir' and I resented
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Montagu won his first fame in the 1940s by arguing that race was
a social construct, a product of perceptions about race, rather
than a biological fact. He was a principal drafter of a U.N.
``Statement on Race'' in 1949 that incorporated these ideas.
</P>
<P>
   His most noticed work, however, was his 1953 book ``The Natural
Superiority of Women,'' in which he argued that men were a form of
``incomplete'' woman and that women were in many ways biologically
superior. The attention and the sales from the book allowed him to
resign his teaching position at Rutgers University in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy, in those prefeminist days, was enormous, but
nonthreatening. With his willingness to return reporters' telephone
calls, Montagu was widely quoted and therefore influential. His
professorial manner and dry wit made him a frequent guest on ``The
Tonight Show'' with Johnny Carson.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A television producer of the day captured his appeal. ``All he
does is play himself _ a professor,'' Bob Herridge, a WCBS-TV
producer, told an interviewer. ``He talks about stuff like early
paleolithic culture and stone artifacts of the upper Mesozoic
period and you should see the fan mail! It's fantastic!''
</P>
<P>
   In later years, he expanded his commentary to things like Ivy
League dress. ``The Ivy League look in men's fashions is to be
deplored on a number of grounds, if not on the ground of taste
itself,'' he wrote in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Although an occasional pipe smoker at one point in his life, he
opposed tobacco in public places. If smoking cannot be banned on
airplanes, smokers should at least be segregated to the back of the
plane, he wrote in 1971. ``It would be a simple act of civility and
serve to increase the pleasure of both nonsmokers and smokers _ the
nonsmokers breathing relatively unpolluted air and the smokers
enjoying the pollution of others as well as their own.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Montagu is survived by his wife, the former Marjorie Peakes, and
three children, Audrey Murphy of Sutton, Mass.; Barbara Johnstone
of Princeton, and Geoffrey Montagu of Los Angeles. He also had four
grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

GRIEF FOR IMMIGRANT WHO LIVED AND DIED FOR HIS WORK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mexico)  (lb) 
 By JUAN FORERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In his two years in New York, Eduardo Daniel did
little other than work, friends and relatives said. He had plenty
of cousins and friends across the city, Mexican immigrants who,
like him, had arrived to toil and scrimp and save so they could one
day return to their homeland with a tidy nest egg.
</P>
<P>
   But working six days a week as a construction worker didn't
leave Daniel, who lived in Brooklyn, much of a chance to see his
cousins in the Bronx or form bonds with the friends he made at
construction sites. Like countless other illegal immigrants who
come to New York, Daniel came with a specific purpose: to work,
save and go home, relatives said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, though, those relatives and friends, accompanied by a
handful of reporters and representatives of a Manhattan law firm,
descended on a small funeral home in Brooklyn from far corners of
the city and from New Jersey to pray, grieve and remember Daniel at
his wake.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old from San Matias Cocoyotla _ a small village in
southern Mexico where poverty has prompted dozens, if not hundreds,
of residents to head for New York _ died last Tuesday when the
unfinished building where he was working in Brooklyn collapsed in a
cascade of steel beams and wet cement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to come here and be with family and friends. These
are the times when we must be most united,'' said Augustina Torres,
who arrived from San Matias in 1988 and counts herself as among the
first from the town to make the trek to New York. ``You don't know
how much it hurts to have one of us die here. We consider ourselves
from one family.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel, who sent about $150 a week to his parents and saved the
rest so he could one day build a house in his hometown, will now
return for burial in San Matias Cocoyotla. On Tuesday, his body
will be shipped to Mexico City and then south to the village, in
the parched southern state of Puebla.
</P>
<P>
   In San Matias Cocoyotla, a community of about 5,000, relatives
and townspeople are to conduct a wake for the young worker for at
least two nights.
</P>
<P>
   Tentative plans call for Daniel's coffin to be paraded through
the town on Thursday, in a traditional funeral march, a mariachi
band leading the way, until his burial at the walled cemetery on
the village outskirts, said Martha Ramirez, a cousin who lived with
Daniel in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, though, it was time for relatives and friends in New
York to grieve. Wearing workmen's boots and jeans, dozens arrived
at the funeral home, where they sat quietly in folding chairs and
stared at Daniel's body as it lay in a white coffin in the front of
a wood-paneled room. His hair combed neatly back, Daniel's body was
dressed in a starched white shirt and his large hands held a
rosary. His black Nike baseball cap sat at the head of the casket.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Daniel had, like many Mexicans in New York, arrived in the city
and immediately undertaken a variety of jobs, from washing dishes
to working in a market. Unlike many of his countrymen here, he did
not have a wife and children to support in Mexico. But his
immediate family, his parents _ Eduardo Daniel and Teresa Gutierrez
_ and four siblings, were relying on the money he sent home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked to get ahead, to help his family get ahead in
Mexico,'' said Braulio Daniel, 36, a cousin who lives in the Bronx.
``He worked to help his family and his brothers and sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Daniel found employment in construction, although it
is unclear how long he had been with the contractor that was
working on the site where he suffered his fatal injuries.
</P>
<P>
   By union standards, the pay was slight, but the $8 an hour
allowed Daniel to sent back as much as $150 a week, said Ms.
Ramirez. After paying rent at the apartment, which he shared with
five others, he saved what he could for the dream house he hoped to
build back home, relatives said.
</P>
<P>
   Tomas Daniel, 28, a cousin who lives in the Bronx, said he
hadn't seen Daniel in months. But he said he was shaken that
someone he had known since childhood had died here in New York, in
_ of all things _ his workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel hurt, to lose a cousin like this,'' said Daniel. ``We
came here to this city to work, and then this, but what can we do?
We can only feel bad to lose a relative here in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for workers at the wake, Daniel's death has been a cold
reminder that the American dream that they all seek can be elusive.
They all know that high living costs coupled with poor pay and
exploitive working conditions often mean people have to return to
Mexico without much in the way of savings.
</P>
<P>
   They also know about the risks inherent in some jobs. But for
someone to lose a life is almost incomprehensible, said some
friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Hernandez, a co-worker on the construction site who was
among several Mexicans injured when a floor collapsed under the
weight of wet cement, said he had never thought of the possibility
that he or any one else could be badly hurt or killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so bad because for me, he was my comrade, my good
friend,'' said Hernandez. ``He was a great guy. He was the one who
died, but I tell you it could just as easily have been me.''

<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ Nick Sheppard remembers what it's like to have
to play the day after a frustrating loss.
</P>
<P>
   So the 6-foot-11 senior came to play Sunday and scored 18 points
to help host Pepperdine beat Colorado State 67-57 and win the
consolation game of the Sparkletts Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   Three seasons ago, Sheppard, then at Louisiana State, knew a big
game was needed after the Tigers lost. The next game was at
nationally ranked Michigan, and Sheppard scored a career-best 19
points.
</P>
<P>
   His 18 points Sunday, coming on 9-of-12 shooting with a distinct
height advantage over the smaller Rams, are his best as a Wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just play. I don't worry about points,'' Sheppard said. ``I
worry about winning.''
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's loss to North Carolina-Charlotte, in which the
Waves made up a double-digit deficit and briefly led, a victory
made Pepperdine (3-1) feel better. The locker room was loud and
festive as the players showered and dressed.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves shook off a sluggish first half in which they shot
just 33 percent from the field and failed to take full advantage of
Colorado State's (1-2) 14 turnovers. Pepperdine led 21-19 at the
half but surged in the second half with a 14-0 run in a 2-minute,
56-second span that made put it 59-42.
</P>
<P>
   ``A team with character would be disappointed,'' Pepperdine
coach Jan van Breda Kolff said. ``There's no shame in getting
knocked down. The shame is in not getting back up.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Armstrong scored 15 points for Pepperdine, including two
on an alley-oop during the run. Kelvin Gibbs added 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   Ceedric Goodwyn led Colorado State with 16 points, and Andy
Birley scored 14 points, most from beyond the 3-point arc.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rams hurt themselves with 26 turnovers. In Saturday's
game against St. Bonaventure, they had 32.

COMMENTARY: JEREMIAH SPEAKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Changes ``misers'' to ``hoarders'' in 9th graf.)

   HARPERS FERRY, W.Va. _ In changing around the clothes in my
closet to get ready for winter, I made a dismaying discovery: I
have 38 shirts.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of person needs 38 shirts? I am not a clothes horse,
much less a shirt freak. Even after subtracting the purple
polyester corduroy given to me that I would not be caught dead in,
that leaves more shirts than a man can wear in a month.
</P>
<P>
   My first reaction is defensive. What's wrong with having a vast
assortment of shirts? I make a good living; the good times are
rolling. So what if there's no more room on my shelves? That means
only that it's time to build more shelving.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, my shirt acquisition program makes me an
economy-driving consumer. This adds to the profits of Van Heusen or
Brooks Brothers, thereby raising the stock value of America's
pension funds and putting rice in the mouths of impoverished
Malaysians who sew on the sleeves. Spending can thus be justified
as a virtue, even when it buys the unneeded.
</P>
<P>
   Muttering the millennial mantra, ``Spendthriftiness is next to
godliness,'' I went to the factory-outlet mall in Hagerstown, Md.
There, on Thanks-for-your-patronage Weekend, consumer consummation
was rife. Hordes of buyers lined up to snatch items reduced from
``list prices'' that only fools in department stores pay.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by my value-savvy family, I experienced the thrill
of the bargain hunt. Nine West and Timberland shoes went for a
pittance; Ralph Lauren suits from only last season were swept off a
clearance rack; Donna Karan cashmere sweaters that hung down to the
ankles were offered in all their dark-gray glory for a measly 99
bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Every plastic-carded purchase seemed to be vengeance against the
evil forces of ``list.'' To get an early-bird reduction from the
sale price _ with 50 percent off for the second pair of unneeded
whatever _ was a buyer's bliss.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, and yet. Standing here in the epicenter of
pre-Christmasism, laden with shopping bags of merchandise that
proved my worth both as a provider and as a conspicuous consumer, a
nagging thought rooted in the dim past intrudes: Is this the way I
want to spend my leisure time? What kind of cheap triumph is a
cheap sweater? Who needs all this stuff anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Never say ``piffle'' to an epiphany. Today's rush to buy is not
yesterday's addiction to acquisition. We have gone past that lust
for possessions that motivated the hoarders of yesteryear. Greed is
no longer the game; in our time, shopping has become the primary
form of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   So here we are in the Age of Shoppertainment. What we buy and
wear merges with what we see and hear; this great blob of
self-absorption and inter-amusement takes up our time and occupies
our minds. The moving finger writes the message on the T-shirt: To
fill the shopping cart is to fulfill oneself.
</P>
<P>
   The philosophy of the shoppertainers holds that the act of
spending and not the object acquired is the source of fun. In the
past, the poet worried that ``getting and spending, we lay waste
our powers,'' but as the getting gets easier, it's the spending
that gives us the kick.
</P>
<P>
   You can shop the world, but I want to get off. Mall mania may be
the marketing majority's way of living, but it's no way of life.
Doing the outlet center does not stimulate the mind or recreate the
body or satisfy the soul.
</P>
<P>
   The modern Jeremiah asks: As you snatch the merchandise off the
shelf, are you learning something, or _ just as important _ are you
teaching anything? The money you spend today you might remake
tomorrow, but the time you spend spending can never be bought back.
</P>
<P>
   Worry not, the sensual sybarites of suburbia assure us, the
malls and the factory-outlet centers are transitory. Coming
generations will turn to the virtual virtues of Internet intellect,
and knowledge and art will be the intercourse most desired.
</P>
<P>
   But do you know what our offspring are already doing on that
brave new medium? They say they are ``engaged in e-commerce,'' but
what they are doing is amusing themselves shopping.
</P>
<P>
   This Jeremiah sees that future and it works all too well. Picked
up a couple of nice shirts, though.

JETS LET A GAME _ AND LIKELY THEIR SEASON _ SLIP AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The tantalizing hope that the New York Jets could
salvage their season all but disappeared Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Indianapolis Colts halted the Jets' three-game winning
streak after Wayne Chrebet failed to hold a pass on a play he had
helped draw up seconds earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets held the Colts to their lowest point total of the
season but lost by 13-6. The defeat dropped the Jets' record to 4-7
while the Colts (9-2) extended their winning string to seven games.
</P>
<P>
   With 95 seconds remaining, there was a sense of momentum that
had been missing most of the game from the Jets' offense. Ray Lucas
was directing a drive that had started on his 25. He had converted
a fourth-and-7 pass to Curtis Martin. Now the Jets were on the
Colts' 26, a third-and-19 pass to Dedric Ward had been batted away
in the end zone, and the Jets called time. They huddled on the
sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Then they tried a pass play that Chrebet helped design.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pass I've caught thousands of time in practice and
games,'' Chrebet said later. ``I told them the middle of the field
probably will be open.''
</P>
<P>
   He hoped to get behind a linebacker and between the safeties and
that somehow Lucas could get him the ball. Lucas did, but Chrebet
had to leave his feet for the football, and twisted his smallish
body for it. He had it in the hands that have led the league in
clutch third-down receptions. This time, though, the ball sailed
right into his face mask and ricocheted out of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   It sailed with what already was a long-shot chance by the Jets
to make the playoffs. The club had talked of winning its final nine
games for a 10-6 record. On Saturday night, linebacker Mo Lewis had
told the team: ``Let's show them we've got the heart of a champion.
Champions don't quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Coach Bill Parcells was moved to say, ``This is
probably the worst loss of the season. Even worse than the Raiders
because I know it should have been better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets took the field late Sunday afternoon in better shape
than they had started Sunday morning. For the Patriots (6-5) had
lost to the Bills, and a Jets' victory not only would have moved
them closer to .500, with the Giants on next week's schedule, but
would have produced a better East Division record than New England,
a tie-breaking factor for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But reality set in for Lucas, who has now failed to direct a
touchdown drive for six straight quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's horrible,'' said the emotional Lucas later. ``We gave
this game away. We may be out of it for real right now, but in my
heart and mind _ no way.''
</P>
<P>
   All the Jets could squeeze out of the RCA Dome Sunday was a pair
of field goals, coming on their opening drives. Lucas' passes
failed to average even 5 yards apiece and his 12 for 22 effort
gained only 102 yards.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the remarkable Jets' defense did even better this time
against the American Conference's highest-scoring team. The Colts
came in averaging 29.4 points a game. The last time the teams met,
the Colts won by 16-13. This time Peyton Manning was held to under
200 passing yards for the only time this year, the Colts produced
their lowest point total, and he was intercepted twice for the
first time in nine games.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jets cannot afford the several mistakes they made even
though they did not turn over the ball once Sunday and generated
three turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells talked about the ``critical mistake'' on the final
drive that had put the Jets in that last-ditch pass situation.
Curtis Martin had run the ball to the Colts' 10, but Kerry Jenkins
was called for holding. It was the Jets' 10th penalty of the game,
and put them in the position of needing a miracle play.
</P>
<P>
   And there was also the third play of the game _ a potential
touchdown pass that went awry. For this play they employed Jerald
Sowell, the fullback who hadn't seen any action since Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets began the game with one of their most entertaining
drives of the season, one that almost sucked the din out of the
dome.
</P>
<P>
   First, Lucas spotted Keyshawn Johnson for 21 yards as the
defense overcommitted against the big receiver. Then Lucas faked a
handoff and rocketed a pass to Johnson slanting over the middle for
17 more.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on the Colts' 32, Lucas handed off to Sowell, a reserve
back who had been recruited by Tulane as a quarterback. He threw
the first pass of his NFL career, to a wide open Johnson in the end
zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I completed that pass twice in practice this week,'' said
Sowell. ``I overthrew him.''
</P>
<P>
   The pass was far off the mark. Still, the Jets got down to the
18. But the red zone _ the sector inside the 20 _ has not been
hospitable territory for them this year. They are the worst team in
the American Conference at producing touchdowns from this area,
crossing the goal line barely a third of the time.
</P>
<P>
   They failed this time, too, settling for a 33-yard field goal
from John Hall and a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   On the Colts' first play from scrimmage, Edgerrin James fumbled
his 5-yard pass from Manning as Marvin Jones snared him and the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   Again the Jets got into the red zone, and again came away with
only a field goal, a 30-yarder from Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Manning seemed concerned at the line of the scrimmage.
Repeatedly he shouted to his receivers to notice something unusual
the Jets' defense was doing. Once, from the shotgun, he even ran up
to his center to scream into his ear, then dashed back into
position.
</P>
<P>
   But if he was confused, he quickly solved the problems. He
directed an 84-yard drive in which he converted a pair of third
downs to set up a 2-yard scoring pass to tight end Marcus Pollard,
who put a little move on Victor Green in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Penalties continued to prevent the Jets from sustaining drives
in the second quarter _ they committed six by halftime. And they
would make only one third-down conversion in 11 attempts for the
game.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts made few mistakes on their final drive of the half,
and when Mike Vanderjagt kicked a 22-yard field goal, Indianapolis
had a 10-6 lead. His fourth-quarter field goal put the Jets a
touchdown and extra point away from tying the score.
</P>
<P>
   Chrebet almost had that touchdown, but the ball and, seemingly
the Jets' season, went bounding away.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jonathan Alexander was sitting comfortably in his
stroller, ready to roll. His twin sister, Rachel, was screaming.
She did not want to wear a jacket. She did not want to take a walk.
She did not want to do much of anything, it seemed, but arch her
back and wail in protest. Suddenly, as if in sympathy, Jonathan
joined her.
</P>
<P>
   Their mother, Robin Pollock, quickly attached Rachel to a baby
carrier on her chest, while a baby sitter on standby stuck a
pacifier in the little girl's mouth. One 13-month-old twin in the
stroller, one attached to her mother's chest, out of their
apartment and into the elevator they went. Making their way through
the lobby was akin to a final maneuver in a playoff game: a quick
move to the left, a fast pull to the right &UR; .  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In New York City on any day of the week, one is bound to
encounter a harried parent like Ms. Pollock, pushing a pair of
matching faces in their double stroller. Since 1987, the number of
twins has grown 20 percent in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the boom is everywhere. At an elementary school in
Brooklyn, 26 sets of twins showed up this year. Lamaze coaches, who
used to see one set of parents expecting twins a year, now report
one a month.
</P>
<P>
   It is much the same in the rest of the country, where a
significant rise in the use of fertility treatments has largely
contributed to a 55 percent overall jump in the births of twins
since 1980, according to figures from the National Center for
Health Statistics. &UR;  &LR;  For many parents of twins, the obstacles can
be daunting, starting with pregnancy. Women who become pregnant
with twins are automatically put into a high-risk classification by
their doctors, and require more monitoring and appointments and
often have more emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that twins tend to be more labor intensive in
terms of their management,'' said Dr. Michael Strongin, an
obstetrician at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. But because
insurance companies do not consider the extra time and care these
patients need when they set reimbursement rates, the cases tend to
go to a few doctors specializing in multiple births, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not uncommon for women pregnant with twins to require bed
rest or very curtailed activity, which comes as a big shock to
someone who has spent the last decade of her life powering ahead in
a busy career.
</P>
<P>
   Elena Nachmanoff, a vice president of NBC News, who gave birth
to twins three years ago, was told she needed to lie down on her
left side several hours a day in the final stretch of her
pregnancy. The news came just as she was hiring 250 people for a
new division. So she interviewed them all while reclining on her
office couch. ``People went along with it,'' Ms. Nachmanoff said.
``What could they do? I went into labor that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Pediatricians say that their roles, too, have altered as more
twins have come into their practices. They have had to learn to
comfort parents who have one child who is ready to go home but must
leave one behind in the intensive care unit, a not uncommon
situation, since multiple births often result in premature babies
and complications.
</P>
<P>
   They also say that pressing parents to treat each child as a
complete individual _ not dressing them alike or assuming that they
will develop on the same track _ often takes precedence over
treating head colds.
</P>
<P>
   Once children are old enough for school, parents of twins say,
the stress automatically doubles as they race with ``singletons'' _
twin world argot for single children _ to get spots in private
schools and the elite public school programs.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, a dozen parents all insisted that private schools
were loath to give two coveted spots to one family with twins
because two families produced more fund-raising power. Private
school admissions officers uniformly denied the accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Having one twin get accepted into a school when another does not
is one of the most painful, and logistically difficult, problems
their parents often face.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Berg prayed that his sons, Bryan and Gregory, would get
into a public school kindergarten program for gifted children. But
only one of the twins, now 7, got into the program, so the two went
to different schools their first year. ``In one way it was good
because it allowed them both to explore their own way,'' Berg said.
``But then they had different friends and different play dates, and
that was difficult, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Smadar Levy, who lives in Brooklyn with her twin fourth-graders,
said that going to a public school, P.S. 276 in Canarsie, that was
chock full of twins was a boon for her children, Briana and Seth
Zeltzer. ``Teachers have become sensitive to it,'' Mrs. Levy said.
``There are some stronger sibling rivalry issues with twins. They
try to foster each special talent each child has, and know not to
refer to them as `the twins.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the tension, isolation and difficulties, parents of
twins say things do get better, especially when their children
develop a symbiotic relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first year, many parents say if the house hadn't burned
down it was a successful day,'' said Kathy Junior, the co-director
of Mothering Multiples, a support group. ``But then there is
something so magical about watching these two beings share a
budding relationship together. In the end, they have to say that it
was a wonderful experience.''

INTERNET EQUIPMENT MAKER PLANNING TO MAKE A $4.3 BILLION
ACQUISITION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (jw) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Redback Networks, a maker of equipment to help Internet service
providers transmit data more easily, is acquiring Siara Systems for
about $4.3 billion in stock, company executives said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Redback makes a box called a subscriber management system that
helps Internet service providers, like telephone companies and
cable operators, send data quickly over high-speed broad band
networks. In buying Siara Systems, Redback hopes that the optical
networking equipment and software Siara is developing will turn
Redback into one of the first one-stop shops for products needed to
run the next generation of computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   Optical networking, which makes it easier to send more
information quickly across broad band networks, is all the rage
among technology companies in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those companies are paying astonishing prices for
enterprises that have no products or revenues but that hold promise
in the race to offer high-speed Internet access to homes and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems, for one, raised eyebrows recently when it agreed
to buy Cerent Corp &UR; . &LR;  and Monterey Networks, two networking
concerns, in deals with a combined value of more than $7.5 billion.
And several public companies are already developing products in
this field, too, including Sycamore Networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all taken aback by where the valuations are,'' said
Dennis Barsema, Redback's chief executive. ``Cisco's payment for
Cerent was sort of a new benchmark.''
</P>
<P>
   But what Redback is really paying for is talent _ 170 engineers
_ and the promise that their ideas will be more market-worthy than
those of their competitors. Siara sells no products but is expected
to begin testing some in the middle of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Redback is a very bold company,'' said Barsema, who will
remain as chief executive in the combined company. ``We think this
is a key strategic move to broaden the reach into the new access
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Redback, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., recently sold shares in one
of the most watched initial public offerings of the year. On
Friday, Redback's stock closed down $3.1875 a share, at $137.375,
in Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   A combination with Siara, a privately held company based in
Mountain View, Calif., would give it a market value of $11.2
billion and, Barsema said, increase the available market for the
combined company's products 10 times.
</P>
<P>
   Siara was formed in July 1998 by a group of engineers who had
left Cerent. During the last 16 months, Siara has hired 170
engineers and several high-level executives from competitors like
Lucent Technologies, Cisco, Advanced Micro Devices and Nortel
Networks.
</P>
<P>
   One of Siara's first proponents was Vinod Khosla, a general
partner of Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, the venture capital
firm, and co-founder of Sun Microsystems, who will become a
director of the combined company.
</P>
<P>
   Khosla has had a golden touch this year. Not only was he the
driving force behind Cisco's acquisition of Cerent, but he was also
a key supporter of Juniper Networks, a maker of telecommunications
gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of years ago, we adapted a vision of how to build a
next-generation network,'' he said in an interview Sunday. ``So we
started building these companies around how we thought networks
should be built. The fact that they are valuable is because they
had one, two, three years of development. Now that vision is being
validated.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives for the two companies began negotiating their
agreement three weeks ago, though Bersema said they had previously
discussed a merger as much as nine months ago.
</P>
<P>
   One of the key things that Vivek Ragavan, chief executive of
Siara, said he wanted to ensure, though, was that his executives be
treated as equals in any transaction. He said that access to
Redback would give his company a better idea about how to develop
products that customers could use.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company will keep the Redback name; Ragavan will be
named president of the combined operation.
</P>
<P>
   Once the merger is complete, Redback shareholders will own 62
percent of the new company and Siara stakeholders will own 38
percent. The boards of both companies have approved the
transaction.

SPORTS COLUMN: FOOLISH ERRORS MAKE FOR LOST WEEKEND 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The weekend held such promise for Bill Parcells,
before it eventually crumbled into a devastating loss to
Indianapolis, which all but eliminated the New York Jets from the
playoff race. The head coach lambasted his team afterward, scolding
players by name for blowing opportunities. And their season, too.
It wasn't supposed to be this way.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells' not-so-excellent adventure began on a warm note
Saturday night, when his buddy Bob Knight, the Indiana basketball
coach, trotted through the Jets' team hotel and paid a visit.
Knight proved to be good luck for about a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells opened up the offense, and for a while the Jets looked
more like the Colts than the Colts did. There were halfback passes
and deep balls to Keyshawn Johnson, all of which led to two John
Hall field goals. The Jets were ecstatic on the sideline, knowing
that this was not going to be a Colts blowout.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a series of frustrating, horrible mental errors on the
way to a 13-6 loss. And it all began in the second quarter, with
one of the dumbest mistakes Parcells has ever made as a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   After Jets safety Victor Green was penalized for pass
interference, Parcells lost his legendary temper disputing the
call, and began yelling at the head linesman, Earnie Frantz. During
Parcells' rant, he used an obscenity that would make the
foulest-mouthed comedian blush. That led to Parcells' being flagged
for a 15-yard unsportsmanlike-conduct penalty and it gave
Indianapolis a first down at the Jets' 12-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said something I shouldn't have said,'' Parcells explained.
``First time in 15 years. I apologized to the guy and said sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said that though he made a mistake, the Colts did not
profit from his blunder. And they did not, because defensive
lineman Jason Wiltz later caught a tipped Peyton Manning pass,
ending that Colts' drive at the Jets' 1-yard line. But that's not
the point. On the road, in a huge game, a coach's getting that kind
of penalty is inexcusable, especially when Parcells is always
preaching to his players about how there is no margin of error for
this team.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there's nothing. The season is over. The Jets are not
officially eliminated, but that is like saying Donald Trump has a
chance to become president. He has a shot, but it's on the
probability list in around the same place as winning the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   This loss will stick in the stomachs of Parcells and his players
for a long time. Now Parcells, besides washing his mouth out with
soap, must make certain that his players do not go into a complete
tailspin, knowing the season is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the kinds of losses you want to forget about,''
running back Curtis Martin said. ``You don't like them sitting in
your mind. They frustrate you and anger you.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to put this behind us,'' he added. ``But at the same
time, I'll be saying for weeks, `What if?'''
</P>
<P>
   What if the Jets did not have 10 penalties for 72 yards? What if
running back Jerald Sowell does not overthrow a wide-open Johnson
in the end zone by 5 yards on that halfback option? What if the
Jets converted more than just one of 11 third downs?
</P>
<P>
   And what if wide receiver Wayne Chrebet catches that ball in the
end zone with less than two minutes to go? That is the biggest
``what if?'' of them all. Parcells, Chrebet and quarterback Ray
Lucas basically drew up the play on the sideline. Lucas did his
part by getting the ball to Chrebet in the back of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Chrebet is the last guy you would expect to drop a pass that was
right in his hands. But he did. The ball actually went through his
paws and hit him in the head. Afterward, Chrebet called it a drop
and blamed himself.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was asked about the loss in general, but he seemed to be
speaking about Chrebet when he said: ``Anytime it's money time
you've got to come through. I can only do so much.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets lost this game because of their own mistakes. Yet the
final touch was applied by Manning. He finished a solid 23 of 31
and made some nice passes late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the Jets would blanket the Colts' dangerous receivers,
especially Marvin Harrison, who had only 58 yards receiving,
Manning would simply scramble. Nothing irks a defensive player more
than to see a pretty-boy quarterback run for a first down and then
slide out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Belichick, the Jets' brilliant defensive coordinator, threw
everything he had at Manning. Manning was rarely rattled. Standing
on the sideline, Belichick often had a pained look on his face, as
if he had eaten three cups of prunes. Belichick should not be
ashamed. He is not the only one of his coaching brethren to watch
Manning ruin a perfectly good game plan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if the Jets had not committed so many foolish errors,
Manning would have been the one explaining to the news media why
the Colts lost, instead of Parcells glumly discussing how this was
by far the worst loss of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells let the Jets know his feelings behind closed doors,
using more choice words than he did with the news media, loudly
scolding some of the players.
</P>
<P>
   But this time many of them tuned out Parcells' shotgun blasts.
They knew what had just happened. They did not need his
play-by-play.
</P>
<P>
   They knew it was over.

 EDITORIAL: MONUMENTS FOR POSTERITY  (jw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Nov. 29:
</P>
<P>
   For someone who paid no attention to environmental issues during
his first year in office, Bill Clinton may wind up with an
impressive legacy as a preservationist. In addition to his earlier
programs to restore the Everglades and to protect Yellowstone, the
forests of the Pacific Northwest and the redwoods in California,
the president recently set in motion a plan that would, in effect,
create 40 million acres of new wilderness by blocking road building
in much of the national forests.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, his secretary of the interior, Bruce Babbitt,
has been exploring the possibility of additional action under the
Antiquities Act of 1906, a little-known statute that allows
presidents, by executive order, to protect public lands from
development by designating them as national monuments. If used
intelligently, the act offers Clinton a useful tool to set aside
vulnerable public lands before he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Because it allows a president to act on his own authority and
without engaging Congress, the Antiquities Act is an attractive
weapon to any president whose time is running out and who wishes to
quickly enlarge his environmental record. In 1978, President Jimmy
Carter designated 15 monuments in Alaska, which in turn accelerated
passage of a bill that added 47 million acres in Alaska to the
national park system. Near the end of his first term, Clinton
created the Grand Staircase-Escalante national monument on 1.7
million unprotected acres in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 93 years, all but three presidents _ Richard Nixon,
Ronald Reagan and George Bush _ have designated at least one
national monument. There are now more than 100. Congress has never
revoked a designation, though it has the power to do so, and some
monuments have become revered national parks, like the Grand
Canyon. Yet Congress has never really liked the law because it so
clearly gives the president the upper hand. All it can do is
rescind a designation, which is politically difficult. After
Clinton's Grand Staircase-Escalante designation in 1996, a bill
requiring congressional approval of any designation exceeding 5,000
acres passed the House, but died in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt is considering a dozen sites. The largest is one million
acres on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. Others include the
Missouri Breaks, along 140 miles of the Missouri River in Montana,
and hundreds of thousands of acres in Arizona, Colorado, California
and Oregon. All the projects are worthy, but as a matter of caution
he and the president need to winnow the list to sites most
deserving of immediate protection. Western Republicans, complaining
about a federal ``land grab,'' are looking for any excuse to revive
their attack on the act, which has survived in part because it has
been used sparingly. Overuse could also divert support from even
broader open-space initiatives, including what is expected to be
another serious push to seek $1 billion annually in permanent
financing for the Land and Water Conservation Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Within these limitations, there is no reason not to use the act,
a statute with an honorable history that has produced illustrious
results.

EDITORIAL: THE NEW FACE OF NORTHERN IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Nov. 29:
</P>
<P>
   Northern Ireland's revived peace agreement passed its most
critical test yet Saturday, when the province's main Protestant
party agreed to participate in a new local government that will
also include political representatives of the Irish Republican
Army. The vote by the Ulster Unionist Party was a triumph for its
politically courageous leader, David Trimble, whose willingness to
move beyond old orthodoxies has made a vital contribution to peace.
Overcoming fierce internal opposition, Trimble persuaded his party
to end its nearly 17-month boycott of the new government, even
though the IRA has not yet begun turning over its illegal arsenal
of bombs and guns.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is the IRA's turn to make its own contribution to peace.
By Thursday, it is supposed to name a representative to an
independent commission on disarmament. Actual elimination of
weapons must begin by Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   If the IRA abides by that timetable, 30 years of sectarian
violence that has killed more than 3,300 people can finally give
way to democracy and self-determination for the people of Northern
Ireland. If the IRA falls short, it will rightly be stuck with the
responsibility for squandering a rare opportunity for the peace
desired by the overwhelming majority of Ulster Catholics and
Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's vote provides for the Ulster Unionists to reconvene
in February to see if IRA disarmament is on track. If it is not,
the party would likely withdraw from the government, guaranteeing
its collapse. Meanwhile, the new Northern Ireland Assembly will
convene Monday to nominate a new 12-member cabinet. Four of the
posts will go to Ulster Unionists, including Trimble, who will
serve as first minister or government leader. Two seats will go to
Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, and the rest to other parties.
Later this week, Britain's Parliament will formally pass power to
the new assembly and Ireland's Parliament will formally repeal
Dublin's constitutional claim to the North.
</P>
<P>
   For many decades the Ulster Unionists were stubbornly wedded to
exclusive and unyielding Protestant rule of Northern Ireland. Their
intransigence, in combination with IRA violence, thwarted all
previous efforts at negotiating peace. Now, thanks to Trimble,
Unionism has caught up with the desire of its constituents for a
more hopeful future, based on compromise and guarantees of majority
rule and minority rights.

COMMENTARY: BETTER WAYS TO MEASURE POVERTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Poverty remains, at 13 percent of the population, more prevalent
today than it was during the 1970s despite substantial economic
growth and anti-poverty spending over the past 30 years. In New
York City, poverty remains stuck at nearly twice the national
average and only barely below levels that prevailed during the
recession of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Persistent poverty reflects the fact that economic gains have
largely passed those at the bottom and that an influx of poor
immigrants has hit some large cities. But the figures also reflect
the quirky way the government measures poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported last month that the government is
considering revising its definition of poverty in ways that could
add millions to the rolls. The new definition, if adopted by
government agencies, could change which people, and how many,
qualify for welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have not yet decided to change the
standard so that more people are deemed poverty stricken. But they
are reviewing recommendations made in 1995 by a National Academy of
Sciences advisory panel. The panel reached widespread agreement on
how a family's income should be measured, but it could not agree on
how much income people need to rise above poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The current poverty threshold, adopted in the 1960s, was set at
three times the cost of a minimally nutritious diet. The threshold
has since been increased by the overall rate of inflation, rising
to about $17,000 for a family of four in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Economists have noted serious shortcomings in this measure. It
underestimates poverty in high-cost regions like New York because
it takes no account of huge outlays families must make for housing.
Nor does the standard take account of payroll taxes, out-of-pocket
medical costs or day care and other costs of working.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the standard exaggerates the amount of
poverty by ignoring non-cash benefits provided by the government,
like tax credits to low-wage workers, housing assistance, Medicaid
benefits and food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   By this misleading standard, Congress could provide poor people
in New York City vouchers that would, without charge, allow them to
live in Trump Towers and eat daily at the Four Seasons, yet the
official poverty rolls would not decline one digit.
</P>
<P>
   The panel recommended a more realistic measure of family income
that starts with cash income, subtracts taxes and out-of-pocket
medical, child-care and some other costs and adds in the value of
food stamps, housing assistance and tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of where the poverty threshold should be set, the
panel recommended a method but not a precise answer. It proposed an
elastic threshold that would keep pace with the rising living
standards of low-income families rather than, as under the current
measure, remaining fixed by the food-buying habits of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed threshold would equal the amount that a
representative group of low-income families actually spends on
food, clothing and housing plus 15 percent or so more to cover
other expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly where the proposed threshold would lie would depend,
then, on which low-income families the government chose to base
consumption spending for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   If, for example, it chose families whose incomes fall below all
but the poorest 30 percent of American families, the poverty
threshold would rise above the existing standard, adding millions
more people to the poverty rolls. But the government could cut the
poverty count by setting the threshold in terms of the buying
habits of less well-off families, say those whose incomes fall
below all but 20 percent of families.
</P>
<P>
   Some panel members, like professor Sheldon Danziger of the
University of Michigan, and outside experts, like Gary Burtless of
the Brookings Institution, propose setting the new threshold at an
income level that keeps measured poverty the same under the new and
old standards in the year the new standard is adopted.
</P>
<P>
   That way, the government can adopt relatively uncontroversial
improvements in the standard without getting buried in the
controversy of deciding how many people to label poverty stricken.
</P>
<P>
   The important point is that the new standard would yield a
smarter way to track changes in poverty over time. Accurately
accounting for changes over time soon becomes more important than
the number chosen for the amount of poverty in the year the new
standard is adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, tracking changes is all that a poverty standard really
does. The number 11 in the statement ``Poverty hit 11 percent in
the early 1970s'' is arbitrary. But the fact that poverty rose by
about two percentage points over the next 25 years is meaningful _
something bad happened.
</P>
<P>
   Said another way, Congress needs a standard that would indicate,
were it to double tax credits, housing vouchers and health benefits
for the poor, that it did something good.

makeshift after they were expelled from a shelter in Long Island's
Suffolk County. Shelter expulsions have become almost routine in
Suffolk, which for four years has strictly applied the rules that

first time in December. Social services say that families brought
expulsion on themselves, by ignoring the rules and refusing ample
social service help. (Edward Keating/New York Times Photo)

and mother of two children, has passed up several steps necessary
for promotion, because of her family. First she deferred a
battalion command when her husband, who was also in the Army, was
not given an appointment at the same post in Germany. She was given
a second chance and commanded 800 soldiers in a battalion at Fort
Lewis, but then she passed up the Army War College, again for
family reasons. Next summer she is retiring. (Dan Lamont/New York

children, Rachel, left, Ryan and Megan. Col. Lois Beard was likely
to become the first mother promoted to Army general when she
retired, citing excessive demands. Of all the subjects that
preoccupy women rising through the ranks, few are more pressing
than how to balance motherhood with the all-consuming commitment
required to become a general or an admiral. If the corporate world
has a glass ceiling, women in the military say the Pentagon has a

Public School 276 in Brooklyn has 26 sets of twins this year, 25 of
which are pictured here. The teachers at the school know enough not
to refer to a matching pair of siblings as ``the twins,'' says one
mother of twins at the school. Since 1987, the number of twins has
grown 20 percent in New York City and it is much the same in the
rest of the country, where a significant rise in the use of
fertility treatments has largely contributed to a 55 percent
overall jump in the births of twins since 1980, according to
figures from the National Center for Health Statistics. (James

Sightseers visiting a cross above Boise, which is at the center of
a debate about church and state. For 43 years, the 60-foot white
cross, built by the Idaho Jaycees, has stood like a Christian
beacon on the eastern skyline of Boise. To avoid a potential
constitutional challenge from the American Civil Liberties Union,
the Jaycees even bought the tiny spit of land on which the cross
sits for $100 in 1972. Earlier this month, Rob Sherman, a Chicago
talk-radio host and an atheist ignited a passionate debate in a
speech to Idaho atheists by suggesting that the land transaction
was rigged and that a federal lawsuit should be filed to bring down
the cross. (Glenn Oakley/New York Times Photo)

money into what she calls ``the monster,'' a maternity hospital for
poor women in the city of Hargeisa. But her money is running out
and finishing the hospital is turning out to be difficult. Some
fans of Ms. Ismail say that the difficulties are a likely symbol of
the place where it located: in the self-proclaimed Republic of
Somaliland, which declared independence from the rest of Somalia in
1991. (Ian Fisher/New York Times Photo)

the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay political group. But Tafel sees
his steadfast Republicanism as a matter of stubborn principle, not
pathology. He grew up as one of six children in Bucks County, Pa.,

should jettison everything that I was, my family, my faith, my
political principles, because I was gay,'' he says. (Paul

After four years of melodrama, the Royal Opera House, at Covent
Garden has completed a $360 million redevelopment and will reopen
on Dec. 1 with a gala attended by Queen Elizabeth. While the Royal
Opera and the Royal Ballet can now boast a home fit for the 21st
century, the price has been high, and not simply in monetary terms.
By seeking a $125 million grant from National Lottery profits to
add to its annual subsidy from the government, the opera house
invited scrutiny by press, Parliament and public. The resulting
verdict was ferocious: that Covent Garden was overstaffed, badly
managed and elitist. (Jonathan Player/New York Tmes Photo)

plays on and off Broadway over the last 19 years and has been
called a perennial of the New York theater. ``I always say that at
my funeral I want them to play Judy Garland singing 'I Happen to
Like New York,''' says Ms. Nixon. ``Because I do.'' Ms. Nixon has
achieved her biggest success as the corporate lawyer Miranda on the

direction of Elizabeth LeCompte, is a fierce, iconoclastic

the magazine, which is run by Tina Brown, left, and Ronald A.
Galotti. ``It takes time for a magazine to establish its identity,
and when you're in the early stages of a product's life, you need
all the help you can get,'' says Ms. Brown. ``It's taken time to
organize our approach to Hollywood, which is very much organized
around the world of celebrities.'' (Fred R. Conrad/New York Times

and mother of two children, has passed up several steps necessary
for promotion, because of her family. First she deferred a
battalion command when her husband, who was also in the Army, was
not given an appointment at the same post in Germany. She was given
a second chance and commanded 800 soldiers in a battalion at Fort
Lewis, but then she passed up the Army War College, again for
family reasons. Next summer she is retiring. (Dan Lamont/New York

mother of twins at the school. Since 1987, the number of twins has
grown 20 percent in New York City and it is much the same in the
rest of the country, where a significant rise in the use of
fertility treatments has largely contributed to a 55 percent
overall jump in the births of twins since 1980, according to
figures from the National Center for Health Statistics. (James

the Jaycees even bought the tiny spit of land on which the cross
sits for $100 in 1972. Earlier this month, Rob Sherman, a Chicago

After four years of melodrama, the Royal Opera House, at Covent
Garden has completed a $360 million redevelopment and will reopen
on Dec. 1 with a gala attended by Queen Elizabeth. While the Royal
Opera and the Royal Ballet can now boast a home fit for the 21st
century, the price has been high, and not simply in monetary terms.
By seeking a $125 million grant from National Lottery profits to
add to its annual subsidy from the government, the opera house
invited scrutiny by press, Parliament and public. The resulting
verdict was ferocious: that Covent Garden was overstaffed, badly
managed and elitist. (Jonathan Player/New York Tmes Photo)

THE GOALIE OF THE FUTURE LIFTS ISLANDERS PAST BRUINS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JENNY KELLNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ What do you do with a 20-year-old goaltender who has
already been anointed as one of the brightest prospects in the
National Hockey League?
</P>
<P>
   If you are New York Islanders coach Butch Goring, you have no
choice. You play him.
</P>
<P>
   With the backup goalie Wade Flaherty out indefinitely with a
sprained shoulder and Felix Potvin having played in 17 of the
Islanders' first 21 games, Goring _ to no one's surprise _ gave
Roberto Luongo his first NHL start in tonight's game against
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a gratifying 2-1 victory keyed by Luongo's 43
saves _ 15 in the first period, 16 in the second and 12 in the
third. His only lapse, if one could call it a lapse, came at 6
minutes 2 seconds of the second period, when left wing Anson Carter
broke through after the Bruins had amassed 20 shots on Luongo,
taking Jason Allison's pass from behind the net and putting it in
for the score.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders, looking to rebound after Saturday's loss to
Washington, had struck first, with Jorgen Jonsson scoring his
fourth goal of the season on a pass from Jamie Heward at 1:31 of
the first period.
</P>
<P>
   After taking just five shots on goal in the second period, the
Islanders went ahead, 2-1, at 19:05 on an odd but effective play by
defenseman Zdeno Chara. Chased by left wing Sergei Samsonov, Chara
skated back and forth behind the net, finally reaching around the
left side and poking the puck past Byron Dafoe for his second goal
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Luongo's play was impressive from start to finish. He made glove
save on top of kick save on top of stick save, smothering the puck
after several dramatic stops in the final seconds of play after the
Bruins pulled Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   That's just what Goring was hoping for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't have him up here and sitting all the time,'' Goring
said of Luongo, who was recalled from Lowell on Nov. 22 to fill in
for the injured Flaherty. ``He's earned his start. He played well
in training camp and in the exhibition games. He's here and he's
capable of playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Luongo, whom the Islanders made their first choice in the 1997
entry draft (fourth overall, the highest-selected goalie ever), was
6-6-3 in 15 games with a 2.98 goals against average and a .906 save
percentage for the Lock Monsters. The 6-foot-3-inch, 198-pound
left-hander, who spent four years in the Quebec League, was second
in the American Hockey League in saves.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's fairly sharp,'' Goring said. ``It doesn't do him any good
to sit, and Felix is playing a lot of hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Luongo will remain with the Islanders is uncertain.
Goring said he wanted to determine Flaherty's status before taking
a next step with Luongo, although Sunday night's effort had to help
the youngster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to decide what Flaherty's status is,'' Goring
said. In any event, he added, ``Luongo is a fine prospect and will
be a great player for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Flaherty was downgraded from day-to-day status Saturday night
before the Islanders' frustrating 4-3 home loss to the Washington
Capitals.

   (NYT8) HARGEISA, Somalia -- Nov. 28, 1999 -- SOMALIA-PACESETTER,
11-28 -- Edna Adan Ismail, a former first lady of Somalia from 1967
to 1969 and a public health expert, has poured $300,000 of her own
money into what she calls ``the monster,'' a maternity hospital for
poor women in the city of Hargeisa. But her money is running out
and finishing the hospital is turning out to be difficult. Some
fans of Ms. Ismail say that the difficulties are a likely symbol of
the place where it located: in the self-proclaimed Republic of
Somaliland, which declared independence from the rest of Somalia in
1991. (Ian Fisher/New York Times Photo)

his steadfast Republicanism as a matter of stubborn principle, not
pathology. He grew up as one of six children in Bucks County, Pa.,
with a set of Republican beliefs. ``It didn't make sense that I
should jettison everything that I was, my family, my faith, my
political principles, because I was gay,'' he says. (Paul

After four years of melodrama, the Royal Opera House, at Covent
Garden has completed a $360 million redevelopment and will reopen
on Dec. 1 with a gala attended by Queen Elizabeth. While the Royal
Opera and the Royal Ballet can now boast a home fit for the 21st
century, the price has been high, and not simply in monetary terms.
By seeking a $125 million grant from National Lottery profits to
add to its annual subsidy from the government, the opera house
invited scrutiny by press, Parliament and public. The resulting
verdict was ferocious: that Covent Garden was overstaffed, badly
managed and elitist. (Jonathan Player/New York Tmes Photo)

my funeral I want them to play Judy Garland singing 'I Happen to

SPORTS COLUMN: GIANTS ARE GETTING WHAT THEY PAID FOR
</HEADLINE>
 (CORRECTS ``three'' to ``two'' in 4th graf) 
 (nk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Late Sunday afternoon Wellington Mara
stood in a New York Giants locker room soaked in gloom and
disappointment after a 34-24 thrashing by the Arizona Cardinals.
The loss sunk the Giants to 5-6. But for playing in a miserable
division, the loss would have ended the Giants' playoff hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Mara, who turned 83 in August, is a good person to talk to at
times like these, times when the ship is sinking, despair is
descending. He always has the same unflappable expression, a
bemused smile _ sometimes happier, sometimes a bit more pained,
always barely discernible. He has seen so many highs and lows with
this franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Mara was 9 years old when Jim Thorpe lined up for the Giants'
inaugural game against the Providence Steam Rollers in 1925. In the
intervening decades, the Giants have won 17 division titles and six
National Football League championships.
</P>
<P>
   But the past two seasons have been rough. Jim Fassel, the
Giants' head coach since 1997, has been pummeled by the news media.
After a surprisingly good first season in 1997 _ a 10-5-1 record
and a playoff berth _ he has presided over a listless offense.
Touted as a quarterback doctor, Fassel has been unable to mold a
quarterback to provide a spark: Dave Brown, Danny Kanell, Kent
Graham and now Kerry Collins have revealed one fatal flaw after
another.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after a 23-13 loss to Washington, the Giants' defense
lashed out at the offense for failing to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday the defense was thrashed by Arizona, on the ground and in
the air. After the game, the defense was contrite, the offense
subdued.
</P>
<P>
   But longtime Giants fans realized _ probably a few games back,
maybe months ago _ that the Giants' problems in this 75th season
run deeper than an internecine feud between the offense and
defense, deeper even than whether Fassel should stay or go.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is the hierarchy's failure _ or fear _ of matching
the strength of leadership with the depth and strength of its
organization. The Giants' success was engineered by coaches with
dominant personalities and vision and the Giants' willingness to
seek them out, hire them, give them latitude.
</P>
<P>
   Lately the Giants in the ivory tower have clung to control, have
lost the force behind their foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Mara's eyes twinkled when the names of Steve Owen and
Jim Lee Howell were invoked. Owen coached the Giants for 23 full
seasons, 1930 to '53. His 153 victories are the most of any Giants
coach. He was the captain of the 1927 championship team. More than
that, Owen realized in the early 1950s, when his team was still
running a single-wing offense, that it was time to switch to the
new T formation. He hired Allie Sherman as a coach to teach the
team the new offense.
</P>
<P>
   Howell coached from 1954 to 1960 and led the Giants to a league
championship and three division titles. ``He had such great
manners, you'd never guess he was a Marine company commander,''
Mara said. ``He was tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Parcells rescued the Giants after two decades of
mediocrity. His 77-49 record puts him second in victories to Owen.
Parcells took the Giants to Super Bowl victories in 1986 and '90.
He walked away when the Giants were unwilling to cede greater
control of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Reeves rebuilt a crumbling franchise left by Ray Handley.
Reeves left after the 1996 season, also as a result of struggle,
less over power than control.
</P>
<P>
   The parting with Reeves was so nasty that it seems the franchise
was determined not to hire a dominant personality to replace him.
In this respect the Giants are no different from any other
corporate culture. Managers subconsciously hire those who defer,
who won't challenge, won't resist.
</P>
<P>
   After Reeves resigned, the Giants desperately wanted Nick Saban
of Michigan State. In Saban the Giants saw the fiery young coach of
its future. In the Giants Saban probably saw a franchise unwilling
to yield the control he would need to be successful. The Giants
lost Parcells. Lost Reeves. Lost Saban. They settled for Fassel.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel just wanted to be a head coach. Did not want to grab
power, did not want control. Just wanted a chance to do whatever
the organization wanted him to do.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of winning, the organization is not sure what it wants
to do, and, outside of some vague notion of developing a
high-powered offense, how to do it. The Giants touted the fact that
Fassel was an offensive innovator. He doesn't have the offense with
which to innovate. The Giants have not supplied him with the power.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a call for the Giants to fire the coach: Fassel is a
river that the Giants will have to let run its course. When the
river is through, they should look at their history. The Giants'
foundation is too solid to be damaged by the strength of a coach's
personality. The franchise is more likely to be done in by a
captain so willing to please that he won't deviate from a
disastrous course.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Owen was smart enough to switch from the single wing to
the T formation. Jim Lee Howell oversaw the flex defense. Howell
and Owen, strong personalities, did not destroy the Giants'
foundation. ``They were part of the foundation,'' Mara agreed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 the Giants were more interested in a coach who would
genuflect than a coach who might forge a new path and needed added
power do it.
</P>
<P>
   Now they pay.

<P>
   Breaking down barriers is controversial work. That will be clear
on Nov. 30, when as many as 100,000 demonstrators will march
through Seattle, ostensibly to protest at the launch, at a World
Trade Organization summit, of a new round of trade-liberalizing
talks. But their real target is globalization, broadly defined.
</P>
<P>
   This in a city that thrives on trade: a port, near Canada, home
to Microsoft and Boeing, two of America's biggest exporters, and
birthplace of such global crazes as the hit TV program,
``Frasier,'' and fancy coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Around the world, support for free trade is weak at best; and
the WTO is copping the blame for the perceived evils of
globalization.
</P>
<P>
   It is under attack from trade unions, greens and even consumer
groups, all of whom say its rules advance big companies' global
ambitions at the expense of jobs and the environment. They also
attack the WTO for being secretive and unaccountable.
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments will gain ground unless the case for
globalization is made with renewed vigor. The economic benefits of
the greater openness _ faster growth, cheaper imports, new
technologies, the spur of foreign competition _ that the world has
enjoyed in recent years are too easily taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Greater prosperity is also the best way to improve working
conditions and the environment. Yet for all the gains that
globalization brings, it can also create losers, who naturally
dislike change. Their concerns should not be dismissed. But
shutting out the rest of the world would make everyone worse off.
</P>
<P>
   For all the storm over globalization, too many trade barriers
remain _ one reason that a new round of trade talks is needed.
Despite huge strides towards open markets over the past 50 years,
big swathes of the world economy, such as agriculture, textiles and
shipping, remain highly protected. Many tariffs are still high.
</P>
<P>
   New trade barriers keep appearing too. Booming industries such
as computing and telecoms are vulnerable, notably through standards
that handicap foreign firms. Even e-commerce can be subject to
trade restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   All around the world, protectionist sentiment is alive and well.
There has been a surge in anti-dumping duties on imports deemed
``unfairly'' cheap. Such duties are rarely lifted, so their burden
grows each year. America now has around 300 in place.
</P>
<P>
   Even illegal ``voluntary export restraints'' are re-emerging:
Japan has privately agreed to limit steel exports to America.
</P>
<P>
   Merely to stand still, a new effort to open markets is needed.
It is also the surest way to deflect protectionist pressure,
because the prospect of greater access to foreign markets should
rally export lobbies to the free-trade cause.
</P>
<P>
   Depressingly, the WTO's 135 member governments have so far
failed to agree on an agenda for the round. But they are already
committed to negotiate on unfinished business from the previous
Uruguay round of trade talks, notably on farming and services.
</P>
<P>
   It would be best to broaden the new round to areas such as
industrial tariffs, investment and competition policy, to allow
more scope for the trade-offs on which a final deal depends.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, liberalization should be sweeping, especially in
agriculture. Europe and Japan should dismantle their farm
protection, which fleeces consumers, harms their exporters and
stunts poor countries' growth.
</P>
<P>
   In services, priorities include finance, computing, transport
and telecoms, as well as easing restrictions on the movement of
people, a bugbear for developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   All of that, plus liberalizing textiles and limiting
anti-dumping abuse, would do much to help poorer countries, who
feel, with some justice, that they got a raw deal out of the
Uruguay round. It would also benefit consumers everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   There is one other broad, thorny issue. A balance sometimes has
to be struck between free trade and such other legitimate aims as
protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, countries should pursue these aims in ways that
disrupt trade least. But that can be tricky. So governments need to
find a way of agreeing when curbs on trade can be an acceptable way
to pursue a greater good.
</P>
<P>
   If they do not, the WTO's credibility could be damaged, because
it will increasingly be called on to adjudicate on matters where it
lacks expertise and legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   That is more crucial because another priority for the round must
be to shore up the WTO itself. Only five years old, it has been
looking increasingly fragile.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has impressive dispute-settlement powers, it has
been battered not just by the lobbyists but also by the EU's
recalcitrance over bananas and hormone-treated beef, and by
America's growing disenchantment with curbs on its unilateralist
instincts.
</P>
<P>
   Governments' trade policies are too often hijacked by narrow,
corporate interests, which veer in favor of protection. That is
precisely why the WTO is such a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   It could certainly open up more. But to say it is unaccountable
is nonsense. Its rules are agreed by member governments which,
unlike anti-WTO lobbies, are mostly elected and accountable to
voters.
</P>
<P>
   A political stalemate in Seattle, which is possible, could
fatally undermine the WTO, especially if the critics claim credit
for derailing the new round. Avoiding such a fiasco is the
immediate priority; if, for now, only a narrow, less ambitious
round can be agreed to, so be it. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 875. TOTAL UNCUT IS 1,150 WORDS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   A WTO framework for investment and competition rules would be
worth having, but it can wait. The round's agenda can always be
expanded once it is under way. Whatever happens, negotiations are
unlikely to go far before America's presidential election next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Without American leadership, crucial in all previous rounds,
other countries' reluctance to liberalize, most notably the
European Union's obduracy over agriculture, is unlikely to be
overcome.
</P>
<P>
   But despite America's recent deal on Chinese accession to the
WTO, Bill Clinton is unlikely to provide that lead. He is shackled
by his wish to appease trade unions to boost Al Gore's presidential
hopes. And Congress is in no mood to give the administration the
``fast-track'' negotiating authority which it needs to strike a WTO
deal. With luck, though, this will not last.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, Gore's Democratic rival, and George W. Bush, the
Republican front-runner, are free-traders. By 2001 a new Congress
may turn out to be more open to granting fast-track to a new
president.
</P>
<P>
   America and Europe urgently need to show more genuine commitment
to free trade. Mike Moore, the WTO's pugnacious new boss, has
started the long fight to win over skeptics on globalization. But
he cannot succeed without governments' help. All too often, they
appease protectionists rather than confront them.
</P>
<P>
   By trying to force labor rights on to the agenda for the new
round, for instance, America and Europe are playing with fire.
</P>
<P>
   Globalization is not irreversible. Unless governments come out
fighting for free trade in Seattle and beyond, the huge gains it
has brought could be lost. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   It could certainly open up more. But to say it is unaccountable
is nonsense. Its rules are agreed by member governments which,
unlike anti-WTO lobbies, are mostly elected and accountable to
voters.
</P>
<P>
   A political stalemate in Seattle, which is possible, could
fatally undermine the WTO, especially if the critics claim credit
for derailing the new round. Avoiding such a fiasco is the
immediate priority; if, for now, only a narrow, less ambitious
round can be agreed to, so be it. &QL;

</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   A WTO framework for investment and competition rules would be
worth having, but it can wait. The round's agenda can always be
expanded once it is under way. Whatever happens, negotiations are
unlikely to go far before America's presidential election next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Without American leadership, crucial in all previous rounds,
other countries' reluctance to liberalize, most notably the
European Union's obduracy over agriculture, is unlikely to be
overcome.
</P>
<P>
   But despite America's recent deal on Chinese accession to the
WTO, Bill Clinton is unlikely to provide that lead. He is shackled
by his wish to appease trade unions to boost Al Gore's presidential
hopes. And Congress is in no mood to give the administration the
``fast-track'' negotiating authority which it needs to strike a WTO
deal. With luck, though, this will not last.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, Gore's Democratic rival, and George W. Bush, the
Republican front-runner, are free-traders. By 2001 a new Congress
may turn out to be more open to granting fast-track to a new
president.
</P>
<P>
   America and Europe urgently need to show more genuine commitment
to free trade. Mike Moore, the WTO's pugnacious new boss, has
started the long fight to win over skeptics on globalization. But
he cannot succeed without governments' help. All too often, they
appease protectionists rather than confront them.
</P>
<P>
   By trying to force labor rights on to the agenda for the new
round, for instance, America and Europe are playing with fire.
</P>
<P>
   Globalization is not irreversible. Unless governments come out
fighting for free trade in Seattle and beyond, the huge gains it
has brought could be lost. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Could the bad old days of stagflation be about to return?
</P>
<P>
   Since OPEC agreed to supply cuts in March, the price of crude
oil has jumped to almost $26 a barrel, up from less than $10 last
December and its highest since the Gulf war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   This near-tripling of oil prices evokes scary memories of the
1973 oil shock, when prices quadrupled, and 1979-80, when they also
almost tripled. Both previous shocks resulted in double-digit
inflation and global recession.
</P>
<P>
   So where are the headlines warning of gloom and doom this time?
Their absence is even more striking given that, at the start of the
year, many commentators (including, rather prominently, this
newspaper) expected prices to fall, not rise.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC's agreement to cut output has so far proved more durable
than many predicted. The oil price was given another nudge up this
week when Iraq suspended oil exports in a showdown with the U.N.
over sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Strengthening economic growth, at the same time as winter grips
the northern hemisphere, could push the price higher still in the
short term. Yet there are good reasons to expect the economic
consequences now to be less severe than in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp rise in oil prices follows an equally sharp collapse
over the previous two years, when prices fell by more than half to
their lowest level in real terms since before the 1973 shock. Even
now, prices are not much higher than in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in most countries the cost of crude oil now accounts
for a smaller share of the price of gas than it did in the 1970s.
In Europe, taxes account for up to four-fifths of the retail price,
so even quite big changes in the price of crude have a more muted
effect on pump prices than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Rich economies are also less dependent on oil than they were,
and so less sensitive to swings in the oil price.
</P>
<P>
   Energy conservation, a shift to other fuels and a decline in the
importance of heavy, energy-intensive industries have reduced oil
consumption. Software, consultancy and mobile telephones use far
less oil than steel or car production.
</P>
<P>
   For each dollar of GDP (in constant prices) rich economies now
use nearly 50 percent less oil than in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The OECD estimates in its latest Economic Outlook that, if oil
prices averaged $22 a barrel for a full year, compared with $13 in
1998, this would increase the oil import bill in rich economies by
only 0.25-0.5 percent of GDP. That is less than one-quarter of the
income loss in 1974 or 1980.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, oil-importing emerging economies _ to which
heavy industry has shifted _ have become more energy-intensive, and
so could be more seriously squeezed.
</P>
<P>
   The impact on the output of oil-importing countries also depends
on whether oil producers save or spend their windfalls. In 1973 and
1979 many OPEC countries already had current-account surpluses, and
most of their extra oil revenues were saved. Today, many have large
current-account deficits (Saudi Arabia's hit 10 percent of GDP last
year).
</P>
<P>
   Cash-strapped producers are more likely to spend their windfalls
on imports from rich countries. One more reason not to lose sleep
over the surge in oil prices is that, unlike the rises in the
1970s, it has not occurred against the backdrop of general
commodity-price inflation and global excess demand.
</P>
<P>
   A sizeable chunk of the world is only just emerging from
recession. The Economist's commodity price index is broadly
unchanged from a year ago. In 1973 commodity prices jumped by 70
percent, and in 1979 by almost 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the impact will be more modest than in the past, dearer
oil will still leave some mark. Inflation will be higher and output
lower than they would be otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The OECD's rule of thumb is that a $10 increase, if sustained
for a year, would increase the inflation rate in rich economies by
about half a percentage point and knock about a quarter-point off
growth.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of higher oil prices varies by country too. Perhaps
the biggest risk is in America, where rising oil prices may push
the inflation rate higher than is currently predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The slide in oil prices in recent years was one of the main
factors that helped to hold down American inflation, so prolonging
the country's long economic expansion. That positive factor is now
going into reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Higher oil prices have already helped to lift America's
inflation rate to 2.6 percent in October, up from 1.5 percent a
year ago; the latest rise in oil prices could well push it above 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The core inflation rate remains relatively subdued, but headline
inflation could still spill into wages and hence other prices. If
it does, the Fed might be forced to raise interest rates by more
than is now forecast. So OPEC could yet do more damage than most
people expect. &QL;

   CARLSBAD, CALIF. _ The scene is the epitome of country-club
Republicanism. On manicured greens and fairways, business lobbyists
schmooze with golfing politicians. At the spa, large successful men
loll in the sauna like seals, exchanging gossip. Thin wives parade
their cosmetic surgery and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   But close your eyes, move inside the conference hall, and you
hear something that does not chime with these images of the rich at
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our agenda isn't to cut welfare benefits,'' says the man from
Arkansas. ``We want teachers to get better pay for teaching well.''
</P>
<P>
   The man from Oklahoma boasts about ``the largest road-building
program ever seen in the state.'' And the fellow from Louisiana
insists that ``we can make ourselves the party of the public-school
system.''
</P>
<P>
   These men are Republican state governors. They are gathered in
their Southern California resort not only to celebrate their
particular branch of Republicanism, not only to get one of their
own elected president, but to transform their party and even
America's system of government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think George Bush is helping us create a new Republican
Party,'' says Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of the Republican governors this decade has been one of
America's biggest political shifts. In 1992, after President Bill
Clinton was elected, there were 18 Republicans in state capitols,
five fewer than in 1988. Democrats had the governorships of all the
big states except California.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the reverse applies. Republicans have all the big states
(except California), and run a total of 31 states, with 70 percent
of the population.
</P>
<P>
   These states have 340 electoral-college votes (270 are needed to
choose the president next year).
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of the governors were elected in the Republican landslide
of 1994. But, while the congressional Republicans who swept to
power that year have descended through bitter partisanship to
public vilification, the governors have become the most popular
politicians in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Only 34 percent of the population approves of the job the
leaders of Congress are doing. On a conservative measure, compiled
by Thad Beyle of the University of North Carolina, the governors
enjoy an average job-approval rating of 62 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A different measure, used by a Washington Post-ABC poll, puts
the figure at 73 percent. George W. Bush scores 86 percent. Soviet
dictators would have settled for this.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, it has not been hard to be a governor lately. The
states are awash with tax dollars. And, since they did not have
vast deficits to swallow up the early windfalls of the boom (all
but Vermont have balanced-budget requirements), the governors have
been pulling off an impressive feat for years: cutting taxes while
increasing both spending and surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed governors (Democratic as well as Republican) have cut
taxes six years running, by a cumulative $26 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Potentially, this could be a problem. Governors are spending
what could be a cyclical upswing in tax revenues on entitlements _
such as increased education _ which will be hard to reduce in a
downswing.
</P>
<P>
   But that is for the future. Right now, the main result is to
create a distinctive and increasingly vocal brand of Republicanism:
tax-cutting, ``compassionate,'' non-ideological.
</P>
<P>
   Republican governors are not all clones, of course. Some (George
W., Mike Leavitt of Utah) have boosted spending more than they have
cut taxes. Others (Christine Whitman in New Jersey, Frank Keating
in Oklahoma) have slashed taxes more. But all are policy
innovators.
</P>
<P>
   They experimented with welfare reform in the early 1990s,
lobbied for it at national level and, once Congress had seen the
light, implemented the reforms that have moved half of welfare
recipients into jobs. Now some, led by Jeb Bush in Florida, are
pioneering education reforms _ school vouchers, stringent school
testing _ that could have the same impact.
</P>
<P>
   They are pragmatic. They have to be. Half of them are faced with
legislatures that are either run by the Democrats or split between
the parties. To get anything done they must compromise. And getting
things done is their raison d'etre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get to do the stuff that improves people's lives. I can't
tell you the difference _ intellectually, emotionally _ between
being a governor and being a legislator,'' says Pennsylvania's Tom
Ridge, who used to be a congressman before he was a governor.
</P>
<P>
   Over and above that, they are pragmatic because they have a
fundamentally different constituency from that of congressional
Republicans. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Congressmen are elected by small districts, redrawn every
decade. This is often done in such a way as to lump together all
the Republican subdivisions, or all the Democratic ones, into
single, like-thinking units. This tends to create partisan
bastions.
</P>
<P>
   The governors are different. They are elected by the state and
are therefore accountable to all voters, Republican, Democratic and
independent. The result, as Keating puts it, is ``two different
parties.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Congressmen are ideological, confrontational, preferring
clear-cut decisions. The governors preach consensus and
inclusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they may share the conservative views of many
congressional Republicans, but they do not share their political
habits, so it may be better to describe them as soft and smooth on
the outside, with crunchy bits: the ``praline'' wing of the party.
</P>
<P>
   They are now seeking to make the whole party more to their
taste. That means transferring the state-level habits of government
up to Washington and moving some powers exercised in Washington
back to the states.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is the repository of both these aims. Nearly all
Republican governors have endorsed him (only the maverick Gary
Johnson of New Mexico has backed someone else, Steve Forbes). And
they are helping him in less obvious ways.
</P>
<P>
   Bush holds a ``conference call'' with the governors every two
weeks to get their opinions. In nearly every case, they have handed
over their campaigning machinery to him: they are honorary chairmen
of the Bush 2000 campaign in their states and their supporters are
his foot soldiers. That does not mean their states will go
Republican, of course, but it helps, especially in the primary
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides go in for mutual back-scratching. Bush, his wife and
his father all campaigned for the party in the recent legislative
election in Virginia, helping the Republicans take the statehouse
for the first time this century.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia (a strong Bush state) moved its primary election up to
Feb. 29, which should give Bush an early victory in a big state _
and a safety-net should he stumble in New Hampshire or Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Over and above the support of the candidate, the governors are
raising their profile within the party. Four have been appointed
national spokesmen: on education, health care, taxes and the
environment.
</P>

   And they are determined, says Keating, to use their influence
when it comes to drawing up the party's election manifesto.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, this was dominated by social conservatives, and proved
a disaster. Luckily, party rules say that it is a governor's turn
to have the chairmanship of the committee that draws up the
manifesto this time (the job rotates).
</P>
<P>
   John Engler of Michigan says that, at a minimum, governors
should also screen the state delegates who serve on this committee.
The aim of all this is more ambitious than merely to get Bush
elected.
</P>
<P>
   The governors want one of their own in the White House to
reassert the 10th Amendment to the Constitution, which says that
all power not explicitly given to the federal government resides
with the states and the people _ an idea, they reckon, compromised
by years of centralization.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Republican revolution of 1994,'' says Tommy Thompson
of Wisconsin, ``everybody talked about devolution.'' But now
Republican governors are ``underneath the heels of mother
government in Washington, with her rules and regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not all special pleading. In this year's budget,
Congress agreed, at Clinton's insistence, to finance the hiring of
100,000 new teachers. The states welcomed the money _ but not the
requirement that it be spent on extra teachers, which some states
do not need. ``It broke our hearts,'' says Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is offering something more to the governors' liking. He is
promising states almost total control over federal education money,
provided they test students and make schools accountable for the
results.
</P>
<P>
   This simultaneously increases the power of state governments and
of the federal department of education. But Republican governors
like the proposal because they support school testing anyway.
</P>
<P>
   There is no guarantee that, even if Bush is elected, he will
devolve power merely because he is a governor (after all, so was
Clinton). But on education, on welfare, on social policy generally,
the head of the Republican Governors' Association, Don Schafer of
North Dakota, is probably right when he says that ``as president,
George W. Bush would give unprecedented access to state governors
in shaping national policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that it is not just up to the president and his
gubernatorial allies. Congress will have to approve any change they
propose, and the Democrats there are skeptical of the ``new
federalism.''
</P>
<P>
   But, either way, if Bush is elected, devolution is likely to be
a defining issue for his presidency _ and the battle could
fundamentally alter the balance of power in America's system of
government. &QL;

   CARLSBAD, CALIF. _ The scene is the epitome of country-club
Republicanism. On manicured greens and fairways, business lobbyists
schmooze with golfing politicians. At the spa, large successful men
loll in the sauna like seals, exchanging gossip. Thin wives parade
their cosmetic surgery and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   But close your eyes, move inside the conference hall, and you
hear something that does not chime with these images of the rich at
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our agenda isn't to cut welfare benefits,'' says the man from
Arkansas. ``We want teachers to get better pay for teaching well.''
</P>
<P>
   The man from Oklahoma boasts about ``the largest road-building
program ever seen in the state.'' And the fellow from Louisiana
insists that ``we can make ourselves the party of the public-school
system.''
</P>
<P>
   These men are Republican state governors. They are gathered in
their Southern California resort not only to celebrate their
particular branch of Republicanism, not only to get one of their
own elected president, but to transform their party and even
America's system of government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think George Bush is helping us create a new Republican
Party,'' says Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of the Republican governors this decade has been one of
America's biggest political shifts. In 1992, after President Bill
Clinton was elected, there were 18 Republicans in state capitols,
five fewer than in 1988. Democrats had the governorships of all the
big states except California.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the reverse applies. Republicans have all the big states
(except California), and run a total of 31 states, with 70 percent
of the population.
</P>
<P>
   These states have 340 electoral-college votes (270 are needed to
choose the president next year).
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of the governors were elected in the Republican landslide
of 1994. But, while the congressional Republicans who swept to
power that year have descended through bitter partisanship to
public vilification, the governors have become the most popular
politicians in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Only 34 percent of the population approves of the job the
leaders of Congress are doing. On a conservative measure, compiled
by Thad Beyle of the University of North Carolina, the governors
enjoy an average job-approval rating of 62 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A different measure, used by a Washington Post-ABC poll, puts
the figure at 73 percent. George W. Bush scores 86 percent. Soviet
dictators would have settled for this.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, it has not been hard to be a governor lately. The
states are awash with tax dollars. And, since they did not have
vast deficits to swallow up the early windfalls of the boom (all
but Vermont have balanced-budget requirements), the governors have
been pulling off an impressive feat for years: cutting taxes while
increasing both spending and surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed governors (Democratic as well as Republican) have cut
taxes six years running, by a cumulative $26 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Potentially, this could be a problem. Governors are spending
what could be a cyclical upswing in tax revenues on entitlements _
such as increased education _ which will be hard to reduce in a
downswing.
</P>
<P>
   But that is for the future. Right now, the main result is to
create a distinctive and increasingly vocal brand of Republicanism:
tax-cutting, ``compassionate,'' non-ideological.
</P>
<P>
   Republican governors are not all clones, of course. Some (George
W., Mike Leavitt of Utah) have boosted spending more than they have
cut taxes. Others (Christine Whitman in New Jersey, Frank Keating
in Oklahoma) have slashed taxes more. But all are policy
innovators.
</P>
<P>
   They experimented with welfare reform in the early 1990s,
lobbied for it at national level and, once Congress had seen the
light, implemented the reforms that have moved half of welfare
recipients into jobs. Now some, led by Jeb Bush in Florida, are
pioneering education reforms _ school vouchers, stringent school
testing _ that could have the same impact.
</P>
<P>
   They are pragmatic. They have to be. Half of them are faced with
legislatures that are either run by the Democrats or split between
the parties. To get anything done they must compromise. And getting
things done is their raison d'etre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get to do the stuff that improves people's lives. I can't
tell you the difference _ intellectually, emotionally _ between
being a governor and being a legislator,'' says Pennsylvania's Tom
Ridge, who used to be a congressman before he was a governor.
</P>
<P>
   Over and above that, they are pragmatic because they have a
fundamentally different constituency from that of congressional
Republicans. &QL;

   Congressmen are elected by small districts, redrawn every
decade. This is often done in such a way as to lump together all
the Republican subdivisions, or all the Democratic ones, into
single, like-thinking units. This tends to create partisan
bastions.
</P>
<P>
   The governors are different. They are elected by the state and
are therefore accountable to all voters, Republican, Democratic and
independent. The result, as Keating puts it, is ``two different
parties.'' &QL;

   Congressmen are ideological, confrontational, preferring
clear-cut decisions. The governors preach consensus and
inclusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they may share the conservative views of many
congressional Republicans, but they do not share their political
habits, so it may be better to describe them as soft and smooth on
the outside, with crunchy bits: the ``praline'' wing of the party.
</P>
<P>
   They are now seeking to make the whole party more to their
taste. That means transferring the state-level habits of government
up to Washington and moving some powers exercised in Washington
back to the states.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is the repository of both these aims. Nearly all
Republican governors have endorsed him (only the maverick Gary
Johnson of New Mexico has backed someone else, Steve Forbes). And
they are helping him in less obvious ways.
</P>
<P>
   Bush holds a ``conference call'' with the governors every two
weeks to get their opinions. In nearly every case, they have handed
over their campaigning machinery to him: they are honorary chairmen
of the Bush 2000 campaign in their states and their supporters are
his foot soldiers. That does not mean their states will go
Republican, of course, but it helps, especially in the primary
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides go in for mutual back-scratching. Bush, his wife and
his father all campaigned for the party in the recent legislative
election in Virginia, helping the Republicans take the statehouse
for the first time this century.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia (a strong Bush state) moved its primary election up to
Feb. 29, which should give Bush an early victory in a big state _
and a safety-net should he stumble in New Hampshire or Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Over and above the support of the candidate, the governors are
raising their profile within the party. Four have been appointed
national spokesmen: on education, health care, taxes and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Next February, for the first time, governors will meet
Republican senators to talk about the balance of power within their
party.

<P>
   ``After the Republican revolution of 1994,'' says Tommy Thompson
of Wisconsin, ``everybody talked about devolution.'' But now
Republican governors are ``underneath the heels of mother
government in Washington, with her rules and regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not all special pleading. In this year's budget,
Congress agreed, at Clinton's insistence, to finance the hiring of
100,000 new teachers. The states welcomed the money _ but not the
requirement that it be spent on extra teachers, which some states
do not need. ``It broke our hearts,'' says Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is offering something more to the governors' liking. He is
promising states almost total control over federal education money,
provided they test students and make schools accountable for the
results.
</P>
<P>
   This simultaneously increases the power of state governments and
of the federal department of education. But Republican governors
like the proposal because they support school testing anyway.
</P>
<P>
   There is no guarantee that, even if Bush is elected, he will
devolve power merely because he is a governor (after all, so was
Clinton). But on education, on welfare, on social policy generally,
the head of the Republican Governors' Association, Don Schafer of
North Dakota, is probably right when he says that ``as president,
George W. Bush would give unprecedented access to state governors
in shaping national policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that it is not just up to the president and his
gubernatorial allies. Congress will have to approve any change they
propose, and the Democrats there are skeptical of the ``new
federalism.''
</P>
<P>
   But, either way, if Bush is elected, devolution is likely to be
a defining issue for his presidency _ and the battle could
fundamentally alter the balance of power in America's system of
government. &QL;

<P>
   SANTA FE, TEXAS _ As in hundreds of small towns all through
Texas, high-school football games in Santa Fe arouse emotions
almost as powerful as those of religion.
</P>
<P>
   School colors dominate the landscape around this windswept town
about an hour's drive south of Houston, and signs proclaiming ``Go
Indians'' (the team mascot) hang in the windows of local shops.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of Warpath Road stands the Medicine Man Pharmacy; on
the other, a sign for Big Chief Foods. On autumn Friday nights _
football nights _ Santa Fe residents gather to cheer the Indians to
victory.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, the greatest drama has tended to occur
before the game. Twice now _ to a huge ovation from the crowd _
Marian Ward, a senior student, has taken up a microphone to deliver
a pre-game prayer.
</P>
<P>
   This would not generally cause much excitement; but Santa Fe is
now at the center of a debate about whether student-led prayers
before school football games violate the constitutional separation
of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 15, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case challenging
the Santa Fe school district's policy of allowing the prayers. It
will hand down its decision next summer.
</P>
<P>
   The case has arisen from a lawsuit filed by the families of two
students, one Catholic and one Mormon, who claim that the
school-prayer policy violates the ``establishment clause,'' which
forbids government to get involved in any religious activity.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has invoked that clause in several
school-prayer cases over the past 40 years, creating a solid
argument that church and state must be separate. Its most recent
ruling, in 1992, barred clergymen from giving a blessing at
public-school graduations.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Fe school board, like other school-prayer advocates,
contends that football prayers fall into a different category. It
is pupils who offer the prayers, rather than school officials, and
it is also pupils who decide whether to have a pre-game prayer at
all. Surely this is just free expression, protected by the First
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Ward's lawyer argues that, if the Santa Fe prayers are found
unconstitutional, this would amount to government control over what
students are allowed to say in an open forum.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Dershowitz, a law professor at Harvard, calls this a
``phoney'' argument. He says the only reason such a forum was
created at Santa Fe was to advocate a Christian world-view.
According to Dershowitz, ``You can be sure that the school would
not allow a student to get up and say ``In the name of Zeus, let's
have a good game tonight.'''
</P>
<P>
   Critics also contend that free religious expression based on a
majority vote is inherently unconstitutional, since it infringes
the rights of those, no matter how few, who may object.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the establishment clause, they argue, is to
ensure that state-sponsored gatherings (such as sporting events at
public schools) do not endorse the viewpoint of one religious group
at the expense of another. Thus, a student-led prayer offends
against the Constitution just as surely as one delivered by a
school official.
</P>
<P>
   The case has stirred political passions on both sides. At one of
this year's football games, dozens of Houstonians protested in
front of the field as Ward (protected by temporary federal court
injunctions) said her prayer, inciting the home crowd to cheer her
even more enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   Even Governor George W. Bush has entered the fray, filing a
brief to the Supreme Court in support of the Santa Fe policy.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent poll, 82 percent of Texans supported his stand. The
court did not mention a separate issue within the Santa Fe case:
whether or not student-led prayers at graduation ceremonies are
constitutional. The case is different, since (even in Texas)
football games are voluntary, but graduations are usually
mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that the court will deal with this simply by
making a blanket statement about prayer at all high-school events.
And it is likely _ especially since, in the years since the
previous decision, two liberals have joined the court _ that it
will decide that prayer is illegal in every case. &QL;

<P>
   PRISTINA _ The question is ``too touchy'' to discuss in public,
says General Klaus Reinhardt, head of KFOR, the NATO-led
peacekeeping force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Kouchner, head of UNMIK, the United Nations mission in
Kosovo, declares it premature to talk about while his staff are
struggling to reopen schools, repair power stations and protect the
lives of the province's few remaining Serbs and other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   But, away from the public eye in the West, the U.N. bodies and
Russia, there is reluctant but growing agonizing about the possible
future independence of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Back in June, the U.N. passed a resolution that brought an end
to Serbian rule in the province, established a U.N. ``interim
administration'' and invited in NATO troops to police the peace.
But the resolution is a statement of intentions that, ultimately,
cannot be reconciled.
</P>
<P>
   It recognizes continued Yugoslav sovereignty over the Serbian
province, while instructing UNMIK to establish the institutions
``pending a final settlement'' of ``substantial autonomy and
self-government.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that nobody dares talk openly about what a final
settlement might be, nobody knows how a final settlement might be
established _ and no Kosovo Albanian is interested in living in an
autonomous part of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   So it is by default, as well as for practical reasons, that the
U.N. in Kosovo is slowly helping to provide the province with all
the attributes of statehood.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few months, Kosovars will start carrying U.N. Kosovo
identity cards and travel documents. U.N. customs officers already
operate on the external frontier with Macedonia and Albania. Cars
will soon have new license plates. And the Yugoslav dinar has, in
effect, been abolished.
</P>
<P>
   By September next year, local-government elections should have
been held. After that, the U.N. will have to start discussions
about the election of a Kosovo assembly and government.
</P>
<P>
   The fear is that if, having lectured Kosovars about the virtues
of democracy, the voters duly elect an assembly only to be told
that it cannot proclaim the independence they seek, then NATO and
the U.N. may come to be seen as occupying powers rather than
liberators from Serbian rule.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Kosovo's ethnic-Albanian politicians are relaxed
about the future, because they believe that independence is
inevitable. But their patience is not infinite.
</P>
<P>
   Were they to find, in two years or so, that the West was trying
to force Kosovo to stay inside a new federation with Serbia, some
of them at least might go back to war.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and U.N. officials in Pristina say they hope this
problem will disappear as the region changes. They argue that, if
and when Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan Milosevic, falls from
power, serious talks aimed at finding a compromise between Yugoslav
sovereignty and the Kosovar desire for independence can begin.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, not only do Kosovo's politicians reject outright any idea
of a compromise, but there is also no reason to assume that any
post-Milosevic government in Yugoslavia would be more pliant on
this question _ especially as it could not afford to lay itself
open to charges of treason.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, if, as is quite possible, Montenegro _ the tiny
coastal republic which, along with Serbia, makes up the rump
Yugoslavia _ were to declare independence, other intriguing
possibilities would open up.
</P>
<P>
   Shorn of Montenegro, the Yugoslav federation would no longer
exist. Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia but not of Serbia, would
no longer technically have a job.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, a new question about Kosovo's future would arise,
because under its June resolution the U.N. is committed only to
``Yugoslav,'' not Serbian, sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   A darker possibility is that, if Montenegro were to declare
independence, and Milosevic were to resist its breaking away, NATO
might get another call for help. It would be difficult to ignore
such an appeal from the pro-western Montenegrin government.
</P>
<P>
   But the last thing NATO wants is to be dragged into yet another
Balkan war. Amid such uncertainty, the diplomatic instinct seems to
be to wish the problem away.
</P>
<P>
   There is no appetite in western capitals to support Montenegro's
secession, but nor is there any desire to back the claims to the
territorial integrity of a country led by a man indicted as a war
criminal. Yet ``sticking our heads firmly in the sand,'' as one
western diplomat in Pristina puts it, is not much of a policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either we accept independence as inevitable, and deal with the
remnant Serb population. Or we try somehow to convince Kosovo's
Albanians that they will never be independent, and try to restore
their contacts with Yugoslavia immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither of these things is likely to happen soon. The upshot in
Kosovo will be the creation of a unique and expensive protectorate,
in which its guarantors, NATO and the U.N., hope they do not become
the eventual targets of ethnic-Albanian rage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, optimistic U.N. officials say that the future of Kosovo
is ``a process'' which has only just begun.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the examples of Northern Ireland, South Africa and the
Israeli-Palestinian dispute, one argues that, before any
final-settlement talks even begin, it would be ``difficult and
unnecessary to focus on the endgame.'' &QL;

   Diplomats and U.N. officials in Pristina say they hope this
problem will disappear as the region changes. They argue that, if
and when Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan Milosevic, falls from
power, serious talks aimed at finding a compromise between Yugoslav
sovereignty and the Kosovar desire for independence can begin.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, not only do Kosovo's politicians reject outright any idea
of a compromise, but there is also no reason to assume that any
post-Milosevic government in Yugoslavia would be more pliant on
this question _ especially as it could not afford to lay itself
open to charges of treason.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, if, as is quite possible, Montenegro _ the tiny
coastal republic which, along with Serbia, makes up the rump
Yugoslavia _ were to declare independence, other intriguing
possibilities would open up.
</P>
<P>
   Shorn of Montenegro, the Yugoslav federation would no longer
exist. Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia but not of Serbia, would
no longer technically have a job.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, a new question about Kosovo's future would arise,
because under its June resolution the U.N. is committed only to
``Yugoslav,'' not Serbian, sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   A darker possibility is that, if Montenegro were to declare
independence, and Milosevic were to resist its breaking away, NATO
might get another call for help. It would be difficult to ignore
such an appeal from the pro-western Montenegrin government.
</P>
<P>
   But the last thing NATO wants is to be dragged into yet another
Balkan war. Amid such uncertainty, the diplomatic instinct seems to
be to wish the problem away.
</P>
<P>
   There is no appetite in western capitals to support Montenegro's
secession, but nor is there any desire to back the claims to the
territorial integrity of a country led by a man indicted as a war
criminal. Yet ``sticking our heads firmly in the sand,'' as one
western diplomat in Pristina puts it, is not much of a policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either we accept independence as inevitable, and deal with the
remnant Serb population. Or we try somehow to convince Kosovo's
Albanians that they will never be independent, and try to restore
their contacts with Yugoslavia immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither of these things is likely to happen soon. The upshot in
Kosovo will be the creation of a unique and expensive protectorate,
in which its guarantors, NATO and the U.N., hope they do not become
the eventual targets of ethnic-Albanian rage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, optimistic U.N. officials say that the future of Kosovo
is ``a process'' which has only just begun.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the examples of Northern Ireland, South Africa and the
Israeli-Palestinian dispute, one argues that, before any
final-settlement talks even begin, it would be ``difficult and
unnecessary to focus on the endgame.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Scotty Bowman doesn't want to say the NHL is in
serious trouble. That would be un-Bowman-like. That would be
focusing on negative energy. After all, Bowman always prefers to
take a positive approach first when problems arise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game, itself, has never been better,'' the future Hall of
Famer said. ``The players are more exciting. The equipment is
better. The buildings are better. The TV contract is better. And
the fans are just great.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I hate to say it. I really do. But I've got some concerns
about where we're headed. I don't know if we can survive at this
rate.''
</P>
<P>
   As the NHL skates closer to the new millennium, there are grave
concerns about the future of the league. Salaries have escalated
beyond belief, revenue streams reportedly are down, and several
teams are in such financial disarray, some owners are threatening
to either relocate to larger markets or sell their franchise to get
out from under the muck.
</P>
<P>
   Canada has lost two teams to Denver and Phoenix. A third, the
Ottawa Senators, also may flee to the United States to escape a
massive tax crunch and resistance from government officials to give
monetary aid. Senators owner Rod Bryden will announce his
intentions next week at league meetings in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say the apocalypse is coming. I think we're there
now,'' said Brian Burke, general manager of the Vancouver Canucks.
``It's not a healthy industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Just ask the New York Islanders, who are struggling to make ends
meet in the antiquated Nassau Coliseum after gutting their roster
of top players. Or the Pittsburgh Penguins, who were nearly
disbanded before being sold to Mario Lemieux in bankruptcy court.
And just last week Florida Panthers owner Wayne Huizenga put his
team up for sale because it was too tough for him to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Without doubt, the league is treading on dangerously thin ice.
The NHL is locked into its collective bargaining agreement through
2004, but many believe it may have to be re-opened well before then
to ensure long-term peace and stability. &QL; 
Payrolls crushing teams &QL; 
There is talk of adding a hard salary cap to help keep small-market
clubs, especially those in Canada, on a competitive balance.
Canadian teams are getting crushed by the weight of the weak
Canadian dollar while being forced to pay top U.S. dollars to keep
their star players.
</P>
<P>
   How quickly have the payrolls skyrocketed? Just two years ago,
the New York Rangers, with the top payroll at $59.4 million, had
$43.7 million in salaries, according to the ``Hockey News'''
1999-2000 salary survey. On the other end, the New York Islanders,
who rank 26th out of 28 teams this season with $18.1 million
payroll, have dumped salaries to avoid increases since paying $18
million in salaries two seasons ago. The Coyotes, who had a $24
million payroll two seasons ago, now have a $31 million payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Owners and GMs have taken note. This summer, many of them took a
hard-line stance on this year's crop of free agents, refusing to
dole out big bucks to big-time players. Privately, the skaters and
their agents complained of collusion. Bettman steadfastly denied
the innocuous, subtle charges, saying teams have a right to spend
as they choose.
</P>
<P>
   But during an interview last spring, when revealing player
salaries had topped team revenue earnings, Bettman said that if
clubs don't take matters into their own hands, the league would
``make sure they know what they're getting themselves into.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to realize what's happening,'' Bettman said. ``If
teams don't get the picture, we're going to have to remind them.''
</P>
<P>
   Economics blow your mind &QL; 
Bowman, who has coached teams to a record-tying eight Stanley Cups,
chuckles when he looks back and sees all the changes during his
legendary career, which includes an unprecedented 1,109
regular-season victories entering the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first team in St. Louis in '67, 32 years ago, we had a
payroll budget of $425,000,'' Bowman said. ``That was for all 22
players. Steve Yzerman's contract in '89, just 10 years ago, was
something like $490,000 _ and that wasn't one of the poor ones.
He's making $5 or $6 million now and next year it's going to be
something like $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be tough for players in the 80s who are out of the
game now to see what guys are making. The economics just blow your
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The average NHL salary this season is $1.3 million. And Bowman's
Red Wings, who meet the Coyotes today at Joe Louis Arena, have the
third-highest payroll in the league at $46.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Hayward, a goalie who spent 11 seasons in the NHL with
Winnipeg, Montreal, Minnesota and San Jose, made $65,000 as a
rookie. He retired in 1992 with a salary of $350,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really an issue, though,'' said Hayward, now a
television analyst for the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. ``Am I envious
of today's contracts? Sure I'm envious. But Bobby Orr is envious,
too. All the truly great players are envious. But the game
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   On the ice, Hayward said the game is in better shape than ever.
He cites the NHL's successful expansion into the Sun Belt, where
teams are thriving in Florida and California, not to mention
Phoenix and Dallas, which won the Stanley Cup last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That being said, I think there are big-time financial problems
that need to be addressed,'' Hayward said. ``A lot of teams are
losing money out there and I think we're in for a very long war in
2004 when the CBA expires. I don't think that's any revelation.
Everybody feels that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Preparing for a possible work stoppage in another four years,
the NHL Players Association has been building a significant war
chest through the sale of trading cards and other licensing
ventures. The union doesn't want to be caught with its guard down,
which some players claim was the case in 1994-95, when the season
was reduced to 48 games due to a lockout.
</P>
<P>
   And the NHL is getting ready, too. It was revealed recently that
the league is assessing each of its teams $10 million for the war
chest that Bettman wants as financial protection against a possible
lockout or strike in four years. Bettman was given owners' approval
for the fund in December. The league is requiring teams to make
their contribution to the fund by April 15, 2003, according to a
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing by Florida Panthers
parent Boca Resorts Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Payout exceeds payoff &QL; 
Have the NHL's problems gone through the roof and left clubs unable
to repair the damage? Boston Bruins President and General Manager
Harry Sinden is just one of many executives who grumble the payout
far outweighs the payoff and that rising salaries could be the
death of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Sinden made waves for asserting that more than 20 of the team's
28 clubs are losing money and that players are gobbling up 72
percent of league revenues, a figure Bettman could neither confirm
or deny.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're paying 133 percent of our gate receipts to players,''
Sinden told the ``Boston Globe.''``'' ``Take every single ticket
that is sold across the league and we've got to find 33 percent
more than that to pay them. Just them. We've got problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden was so fed up with the salary demands of Bruins forward
Dmitri Khristich this summer, that after Khristich won a $3 million
arbitrator's judgement, the Bruins' boss exercised a rare
``walk-away'' clause that allowed Khristich to become an
unrestricted free agent. He later signed with Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Other GMs followed his lead, refusing to pay what had become the
standard market value to re-sign their own free agents. As a
result, many of them went unsigned for several weeks. Many more,
including goalie Nikolai Khabibulin and center Robert Reichel of
the Coyotes, have been told negotiations are off and they won't
play in the NHL this season.
</P>
<P>
   Reichel's agent, Paul Kraus of Edmonton, has said repeatedly
that Phoenix General Manager Bobby Smith is simply towing the NHL
company line to try and drive down salaries. He doesn't believe the
Coyotes are in any real cash crisis and has his doubts about Owner
Richard Burke's claim that the club, four seasons removed from
playing in Winnipeg, will lose as much as $10 million this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it very hard to swallow that a team would move from one
small-market city to another small-market city,'' Kraus said,
sarcastically.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with sitting out the season and not collecting a dime
because of the virtual league-wide, hard-stance policy of
management, some free agents worked out new deals with their clubs
on their own, either abandoning their agents or simply not telling
them. Such was the case with Buffalo's Miroslav Satan and Boston's
Byron Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nieuwendyk of the Dallas Stars also negotiated his own deal
with General Manager Bob Gainey and was granted a three-year
extension worth $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not Arliss or anything, but it wasn't that hard to do,''
Nieuwendyk said, referring to ``Arliss Michaels,'' a fictional
sports agent from a series on Home Box Office.
</P>
<P>
   Union won't buckle &QL; 
Privately, owners and GMs would love to see this trend continue. If
players leave their agents in the dust, think of what that could do
to the NHLPA? Imagine the long-term consequences? How would that
affect negotiations on a new collective-bargaining agreement?
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect the union to buckle under Bob Goodenow,
executive director of the Players Association, who is prepared for
the inevitable when the CBA expires on Sept 14, 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's certainly a possibility that another owner lockout or
strike could occur,'' he told the ``Toronto Sun.'' ``The best thing
would be to have discussions between the parties and for a program
to evolve without that kind of disruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen the cost of the approach when they locked the
players out for more than 100 days last time. It was a great cost.
It's incumbent upon the people involved, myself included, to do
everything in their power to avoid a problem and I'm focused to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   A new agreement and a hard salary cap might not be enough to
save some clubs in Canada, where hockey dominates the landscape and
the soul. Not even the fabled ``bleu-blanc-rouge,'' the Montreal
Canadiens, can feel safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their local tax bill from a year ago was $11 million, which is
more than the local tax bills of all the U.S.-based teams,
combined,'' said Vancouver's Burke, the NHL's former vice president
in charge of hockey operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our local tax bill is somewhere in the neighborhood of $3
million. The withholding on our players' salaries and staff
salaries alone _ forget what we do for the economy and the image of
Vancouver and the restaurants on game nights _ just on what I have
to pay to the provincial and federal governments on withholding for
our staff and players is $29 million a year.''
</P>
<P>
   How long can clubs continue to pay that amount in a gate
receipt-driven sport that already carries the most expensive ticket
among the four major professional sports? The only viable
alternative, short of drastic political changes, is to relocate to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a hypothetical thing. We don't have to wait to see
when Armageddon will occur. It's occurred,'' Burke said. ``We've
lost two teams and the fans of Phoenix are the beneficiaries of one
of those teams. But the fact of the matter is, if (the Coyotes)
were still in Winnipeg and if (the Avalanche) was still in Quebec
City, and if they had payrolls about like ours, that's $29 million
a year from both those teams that's gone from Canada forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't know how politicians can look at that and not
say, `You know what? That was a mistake.' If they had been willing
to pay them $10 million a year to stay, and preserve that asset
that generates an annual amount of money . . . but I guess I'm not
as smart as the politicians up here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the government doesn't step up, I think we'll lose three
teams, minimum, in Canada. We'll lose, I think, both our baseball
teams in Canada. And I think we'll probably lose both our NBA
teams. If that's what the government wants . . . then I say
everyone start the clock.''

   Smashing space probes into celestial bodies is becoming
fashionable. In July, Lunar Prospector was crashed at a speed of
6,000 kph (about 4,000 mph) into a dark crater near the moon's
south pole in what proved to be an unsuccessful attempt to detect
water.
</P>
<P>
   And this was merely the precursor to several brutal encounters
that are due to take place between spacecraft and astronomical
objects over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Exploring the solar system is taking a violent turn. The
European Space Agency (ESA) plans to chase a comet and then skewer
it with a harpoon.
</P>
<P>
   America's space agency, NASA, intends to use a huge copper
projectile to blow a hole in another comet, to see what it looks
like inside.
</P>
<P>
   And on Dec. 3, two football-sized probes will smash into the
surface of Mars. The two probes, known collectively as the Deep
Space 2 mission, will be released from a probe called Mars Polar
Lander ten minutes before that also touches down near the planet's
south pole.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the lander itself, the probes have no parachutes or
rocket motors to slow their descent _ just a protective
``aeroshell,'' which acts as a heat shield. This makes the probes
small and light enough to piggyback on the lander. But they are
also tough enough to survive an impact with the Martian surface.
</P>
<P>
   This impact will smash their aeroshells to pieces and embed the
probes in the soil. The impact will also cause the center of each
probe _ a sensor linked to the rest of the device by an umbilical
cord _ to bury itself a meter or so into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The probe's main body will stay on the surface to transmit its
findings up to the orbiting Mars Global Surveyor craft, which will
then retransmit the data back to earth.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of this violent approach is that slamming a probe
into the Martian soil is easier and cheaper than messing around
with a robot arm, and can penetrate further below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Although the probes will seek evidence of water in the soil, and
take temperature and pressure readings, their main purpose is as a
technological demonstration. If they work, the crash-landing
technique could be used in subsequent missions to prick the skins
of other celestial objects.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ESA is planning an attack on a comet. Its three-ton
Rosetta probe will be launched in 2003, and will end up in orbit
around comet 46 P/Wirtanen in 2011.
</P>
<P>
   Since comets are leftovers from billions of years ago, they are
regarded as crucial to understanding the formation of the solar
system.
</P>
<P>
   This comet was chosen for investigation because it is relatively
inactive _ most of the volatile materials in its nucleus having
been exhausted. (An active nucleus, spewing out gas and dust, would
be more dangerous to approach.)
</P>
<P>
   Having mapped the surface of the nucleus, Rosetta will release a
small lander. As the lander is pulled in by the comet's weak
gravity, it will unfurl three spring-loaded legs to absorb the
energy of the impact, and will then fire a harpoon into the comet's
surface to ensure that it stays put.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with this gentle pinprick, however, the NASA
researchers behind the Deep Impact probe are planning a giant
bullet.
</P>
<P>
   In order to have a look at the inside of another comet _ called
P/Tempel-1 _ they plan to smash a projectile weighing half a ton
into it at 36,000 kph. This will, they calculate, produce a crater
as big as a football field and deep enough to swallow a seven-story
building.
</P>
<P>
   The impact, which is planned for July 4, 2005, will be so
violent that it should be visible through small telescopes on
earth.
</P>
<P>
   According to the planners, the mission will have ``huge public
appeal'' because such an explosion ``naturally attracts the public
and schoolchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysis of the resulting cloud of debris will provide
information about conditions in the primordial solar system. It
could also put the normal fireworks seen that day in the shade. &QL;

UNION CHIEF SAYS `NO' TO REOPENING PACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Any talk of a adding a possible salary cap or
reopening negotiations on the collective bargaining agreement would
need approval first by the NHLPA, and the chances of that happening
are about as good as Wayne Gretzky coming out of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Goodenow, executive director of the Players Association,
declined interview requests by ``The Arizona Republic.'' However,
he told the ``Toronto Sun'' last week he doesn't think a salary cap
is fair to the players _ regardless of the dollar amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not a matter of what is the number,'' Goodenow
said. ``For 10 years now, since I became involved, we as an
association have looked at the markets. Markets can go up and down.
The idea of the players to accept a salary cap system is really a
notion for them to accept less than they might otherwise have been
paid.''
</P>
<P>
   And Goodenow and agents say the players are just trying to get
their fair share of a growing product. Players can ask for more,
the union says, because of:
</P>
<P>
   Expansion fees. Each existing club will have reaped more than
$15 million with the additions of Nashville, Atlanta, Columbus and
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL's new $600 million television contract with ABC and
ESPN, which began this season.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury suites and club seating at new arenas. By next season, 23
of the NHL's 30 teams will be playing in new buildings or in arenas
less than 10 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Appreciating values of franchises. In 1995, the Coyotes were
purchased from former owner Barry Shenkarow for $67 million. An
estimate by ``Forbes'' predicts the team's value today is closer to
$100 million.
</P>
<P>
   To the players, Goodenow has become Gretzky-like is his ability
to transform the union into a powerful wing of the NHL
establishment. Under the direction of Alan Eagleson, who was in bed
with the owners and turned his back on the players, the
organization carried little weight and had no direction.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years on the job, Goodenow has made the rank and file
forget Eagleson. Under his Goodenow's watch, player salaries have
quadrupled in worth and the skaters are more unified and informed
than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   NHL management, of course, blame him for much of today's state
of affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do look upon him as Satan,'' player agent Brian Lawton
said. ``But I don't know where the players would be without him.
The NHLPA was in complete disarray when he took over for Alan
Eagleson. Bob brought organization and unity to the PA that it
never had before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The salary increases speak for themselves. A player like Paul
Kariya would probably be making only $2 million and the average
salary would be around $400,000 now if it weren't for Bob. That's
how much he has meant to the players.''
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure of player salaries, now readily available on the
NHLPA's Internet site, is thought to be one of the major reasons
why contracts have soared in recent years. Salaries used to be kept
secret from the media and other agents. Now, they are used as
measuring sticks for every deal that gets done.

   Smashing space probes into celestial bodies is becoming
fashionable. In July, Lunar Prospector was crashed at a speed of
6,000 kph (about 4,000 mph) into a dark crater near the moon's
south pole in what proved to be an unsuccessful attempt to detect
water.
</P>
<P>
   And this was merely the precursor to several brutal encounters
that are due to take place between spacecraft and astronomical
objects over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Exploring the solar system is taking a violent turn. The
European Space Agency (ESA) plans to chase a comet and then skewer
it with a harpoon.
</P>
<P>
   America's space agency, NASA, intends to use a huge copper
projectile to blow a hole in another comet, to see what it looks
like inside.
</P>
<P>
   And on Dec. 3, two football-sized probes will smash into the
surface of Mars. The two probes, known collectively as the Deep
Space 2 mission, will be released from a probe called Mars Polar
Lander ten minutes before that also touches down near the planet's
south pole.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the lander itself, the probes have no parachutes or
rocket motors to slow their descent _ just a protective
``aeroshell,'' which acts as a heat shield. This makes the probes
small and light enough to piggyback on the lander. But they are
also tough enough to survive an impact with the Martian surface.
</P>
<P>
   This impact will smash their aeroshells to pieces and embed the
probes in the soil. The impact will also cause the center of each
probe _ a sensor linked to the rest of the device by an umbilical
cord _ to bury itself a meter or so into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The probe's main body will stay on the surface to transmit its
findings up to the orbiting Mars Global Surveyor craft, which will
then retransmit the data back to earth.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of this violent approach is that slamming a probe
into the Martian soil is easier and cheaper than messing around
with a robot arm, and can penetrate further below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Although the probes will seek evidence of water in the soil, and
take temperature and pressure readings, their main purpose is as a
technological demonstration. If they work, the crash-landing
technique could be used in subsequent missions to prick the skins
of other celestial objects.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ESA is planning an attack on a comet. Its three-ton
Rosetta probe will be launched in 2003, and will end up in orbit
around comet 46 P/Wirtanen in 2011.
</P>
<P>
   Since comets are leftovers from billions of years ago, they are
regarded as crucial to understanding the formation of the solar
system.
</P>
<P>
   This comet was chosen for investigation because it is relatively
inactive _ most of the volatile materials in its nucleus having
been exhausted. (An active nucleus, spewing out gas and dust, would
be more dangerous to approach.)
</P>
<P>
   Having mapped the surface of the nucleus, Rosetta will release a
small lander. As the lander is pulled in by the comet's weak
gravity, it will unfurl three spring-loaded legs to absorb the
energy of the impact, and will then fire a harpoon into the comet's
surface to ensure that it stays put.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with this gentle pinprick, however, the NASA
researchers behind the Deep Impact probe are planning a giant
bullet.
</P>
<P>
   In order to have a look at the inside of another comet _ called
P/Tempel-1 _ they plan to smash a projectile weighing half a ton
into it at 36,000 kph. This will, they calculate, produce a crater
as big as a football field and deep enough to swallow a seven-story
building.
</P>
<P>
   The impact, which is planned for July 4, 2005, will be so
violent that it should be visible through small telescopes on
earth.
</P>
<P>
   According to the planners, the mission will have ``huge public
appeal'' because such an explosion ``naturally attracts the public
and schoolchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysis of the resulting cloud of debris will provide
information about conditions in the primordial solar system. It
could also put the normal fireworks seen that day in the shade. &QL;

<P>
   PISGAH, IOWA _ Geologically speaking, the Loess Hills of western
Iowa are one of the world's strangest regions.
</P>
<P>
   Loess (the word, at least in Iowa, rhymes with ``bus'') is soil
that was ground into a fine silt by glaciers between 13,000 and
24,000 years ago and then deposited by wind over 1,000 square miles
of Iowa, eventually to be collected in bluffs that stand 200 feet
(60 meters) high.
</P>
<P>
   Only one other country, China, can boast such thick layers of
the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing grand about the Loess Hills. Their charm lies
in subtlety. Cut this fine, pure soil at an angle and the rain will
destroy it. Cut it straight down and it will stand almost forever.
Leave a grassy patch of it alone and it will eventually sag into a
zigzag pattern called ``cat steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Prairie flowers and animals which thrive there are found nowhere
else east of the Missouri River.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, dangers stalk the hills. Trees have invaded
the normally treeless prairie. Thoughtless soil stewardship has
encouraged erosion, as has full-blown soil-mining (the consistency
of loess makes it ideal for building fill).
</P>
<P>
   And there has been a great deal of building in urban areas in
the loess zone, even though the soil is prone to flooding when
disturbed; and even though geologists worry that once the outer
shell is removed, loess may be highly unstable.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise, then, that conservationists have turned the hills
into a local cause celebre.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Leonard of the Des Moines Register, the state's leading
newspaper, has spent the better part of two years writing articles
in favor of a larger protective role for the National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   His energetic work _ encouraged by fond memories of camping in
the hills _ is a throwback to the days when local newspapers
crusaded for worthy, if sometimes eccentric, causes.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, however, it is yielding results: Bruce Babbitt,
the interior secretary, visited the hills last year, and Congress
is close to passing legislation that would authorize a $275,000
Park Service study of options for protecting them.
</P>
<P>
   But the critics insist that, if Washington is to become involved
in the Loess Hills, it will have to be a different sort of
involvement from the usual Park Service model.
</P>
<P>
   Local landowners are not eager to sell their lands to the
federal government. County officials worry that putting more land
in government hands could drain scarce tax dollars from local
schools. And, in an area where gravel roads are the rule (and where
drivers are expected to lift a welcoming finger from their steering
wheel whenever they pass a vehicle coming in the other direction),
no one wants to see a crush of caravans and tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the National Park Service is happy to be creative.
It has increasingly been looking at agreements under which local
residents hold on to most of the land in new parks while federal
officials stick to such tasks as interpreting nature for visitors
and providing landowners with conservation advice.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many once-wary western Iowans are returning the
government's overtures by offering their full cooperation. That,
combined with recent agreements by several big companies and
government bodies to stop buying loess for fill in construction
projects, suggests that the Loess Hills may have life in them yet. &QL;

 CONSUMERS SAY YOU CAN'T RELY ON GETTING, STAYING ONLINE  &HT;     By TOM STEIN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A s consumers, we have certain expectations.
</P>
<P>
   When we pick up the telephone, we expect to hear a dial tone.
When we switch on the television, we expect to see flickering
images. And when we turn up the furnace, we expect to feel heat.
</P>
<P>
   Logging on to the Internet, however, is another story
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first Internet provider was a nightmare that I'm still
recovering from,'' said Marlis Ertl of Pinole, Calif. Ertl was
among scores of San Francisco Bay Area residents who shared their
online trials and tribulations with The San Francisco Chronicle in
response to our question: How reliable is your Internet connection?
``It took weeks to get going . . . and then the cutoffs, outages
and hard-to-log-on problems started. Mostly I ask myself why I took
the abuse so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Ertl _ who until recently used a small Internet service
provider, or ISP, called InfiNet _ is not alone. While a handful of
readers responded positively about their ISPs, it seems many Bay
Area residents believe that spotty service is an unfortunate, but
inevitable, reality of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it works, I love it,'' said Noah Cole of Berkeley,
Calif., describing his experience with AT&AMP;T AtHome. ``But I'm no
longer surprised by a flashing `no connection' light.''
</P>
<P>
   America Online customer Nell Fraser of Walnut Creek, Calif.,
complained: ``Routinely the modem dials six to 10 numbers before
getting a response from the carrier. This delays getting online by
15 to 20 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My Internet connection is AT&AMP;T Worldnet, and on a scale of 1
to 10, I would rate this service as a 1,'' griped Walter Blum of
Millbrae, Calif. ``Every time I try to access my e-mail or the
Internet . . . I am told the primary access number is down, or the
server does not exist, or there is some sort of obscure Windows
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   So what can consumers do to get more reliable Internet service?
</P>
<P>
   The sad fact of the matter is, not much. While it's true that
ISPs shouldn't be going down regularly, we have reached a point
where seemingly daily problems are not unusual. ``Unfortunately,
we're not living in a perfect world,'' said Jeannette Noyes, an
Internet analyst with computer research firm International Data
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Her simple advice to consumers: Vote with your pocketbook. ``If
problems persist, you can always switch Internet providers,'' she
said. ``But also understand that if the whole East or West Coast is
down, the problem is more than just your provider.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States alone, there are several thousand ISPs,
whose services range from nonexistent to excellent. Industry
observers have speculated for years that only the strongest will
survive. And ISPs do seem on a march toward consolidation. Leading
ISPs EarthLink and MindSpring announced in September they would
merge their operations, making them the second largest ISP, after
America Online /CompuServe. Last week, Baby Bell SBC Communications
invested in ISP Prodigy Communications, and said Prodigy would take
over management of SBC's 650,000 customers, including its Pacific
Bell Internet customers in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the big guys are getting together and getting
bigger, so far the smaller players haven't been adversely affected.
``We have claimed for a long time there are too &LR;   &LR; many little ISPs
who can't stay in business,'' said Joe Laszlo, an analyst with
Internet consulting firm Jupiter Communications. ``But some of
these smaller players provide better customer service (than their
larger competitors) and offer good local content.''
</P>
<P>
   Market research firm J.D. Power and Associates recently
conducted a customer satisfaction survey of the seven leading
national ISPs. The firm polled 131,401 households. Based on such
factors as cost, speed/ availability, ease of use and customer
care, the survey ranked MindSpring first, followed by EarthLink,
AT&AMP;T Worldnet and Microsoft Network. Coming in below average were
AOL, CompuServe and Prodigy.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of ISP29 (p59651 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  On the bright side, analysts believe that consumer expectations
are steadily rising. In the early days of the commercial Internet,
or about four years ago, most people would casually shrug off
outages and temperamental connections. But because our lives and
our livelihoods are increasingly tied to the Internet, people are
less like to tolerate problems. This change in attitude is slowly
forcing ISPs to improve their service _ or risk going out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   Providers like AOL and AT&AMP;T Worldnet, for instance, said they
are continually adding more dial-up numbers to their arsenals.
Their stated goal is to reduce busy signals and allow customers to
log on quickly and easily _ even during peak hours _ by giving them
more local numbers to choose from.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have thousands of access numbers for people across the
country,'' said AOL spokesman Nicholas Grahan. ``In San Francisco,
for instance, we have about eight local numbers that our members
can access.''
</P>
<P>
   But many users are still subject to surfing sluggishness or
outright disconnection if they happen to be logged on during peak
traffic hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been encountering severe connection problems around 9
p.m. almost every evening,'' said James Coffey of San Francisco,
who uses both AT&AMP;T Worldnet and Flashcom. ``I have come to suspect
that the problem is that Internet usage has grown to the point that
the system cannot handle the demand at peak usage times.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T spokesman Ritch Blasi said his company this year has spent
$20 million on upgrading its facilities to add capacity and
minimize the number of disconnects. ``The whole industry is growing
at such a rapid rate,'' he said. ``We are making big investments in
our network, but sometimes you have bumps in the road and we just
have to ask people to bear with us.''
</P>
<P>
   According to J.D. Power, approximately one-third of U.S.
households now subscribe to an ISP, up from one in five households
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And Pacific Bell admits that demand for its new high-speed DSL
Internet service is so great that it is struggling to keep pace.
The company said that its DSL subscriber base tripled from 32,000
to 100,000 between the second and third fiscal quarter of this
year. By the end of the year, the company expects to have a total
of 200,000 DSL subscribers in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our customers are extremely satisfied with the
service,'' said Pac Bell spokesman John Britton. ``But we did have
some problems, like being slow to get the service installed and
having technicians who were not fully trained. But now our
technical people have learned to overcome most obstacles and are
getting faster and more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every Pac Bell customer would agree. ``I received Pac Bell
DSL service (in early November) and it's been one nightmare after
another,'' said Marc Itzkowitz of Palo Alto, Calif., who
experienced e-mail outages as well as run-ins with Pac Bell
technicians and customer support reps.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell customer Guy Lion of Mill Valley added, ``The DSL line
connection, so far, has been highly unreliable. It is down at least
one-fourth of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from readers' experiences, what really irks Internet
users is poor customer service and general unresponsive on the part
of ISPs when problems do crop up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went down during an online session,'' said Flashcom customer
Philip Weingrow. ``I called tech support. I was left holding for
over one hour on three separate occasions. I also tried Customer
Care. Ironically, each time I tried to reach them, my call was
dropped. Since I work from home . . . the outage was more than an
inconvenience.''
</P>
<P>
   For the average consumer, an Internet outage is a real pain in
the neck. But for business owners who rely on the Internet to run
their companies and communicate with customers and suppliers,
connection problems can be truly devastating.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, for instance, Pac Bell's DSL Internet service went
down for more than 24 hours in some areas, nearly crippling many
local businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is completely killing us,'' said Brett Adam, who runs
Verve, a software company in San Francisco. ``When our link is
down, we're cut off from the world and that means our customers
can't reach us.''
</P>
<P>
   One way to avoid such a catastrophe, advise analysts, is to sign
up with more than one Internet provider. That way, if your primary
provider goes down, you can still access the Net through an
alternate account.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson companies always learn after they've had an outage
is that they need multiple providers,'' said Charles Carr, an
analyst with research firm Dataquest. ``Everyone needs to have
backup.''
</P>
<P>
   With more and more Internet providers starting to offer free
Internet service, getting backup is easier _ and cheaper _ than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a couple of times when I was unable to get
online,'' said San Francisco Chronicle reader Tim O'Boyle. ``But I
have a backup ISP . . . for free. I have NetZero. And even though
my regular ISP is down, I can check my e-mail, check up on my
stocks and anything else that seems important to me at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted that not all readers hate their ISPs. ``I am
used to writing scathing letters about incompetent service
providers of all kinds,'' said self-proclaimed corporate basher
Nancy Levine of Berkeley, Calif. ``Pac Bell DSL? They're nice,
they're local, they're available, they're reliable. Just don't tell
'em I said so.''

INTERNATIONAL LABOR GROUP BRINGS MESSAGE TO WTO MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Tuesday's march of organized labor will be just as
important as the World Trade Organization's conference itself. So
said Juan Somavia, director-general of the International Labor
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Member governments of the WTO are not likely to adopt a
convention on labor rights, because low-wage countries oppose it.
But the AFL-CIO marchers will remind the world public _ and the
governments who are assembled here _ that labor rights can't be
ignored. And that message is music to the ears of the ILO.
</P>
<P>
   The ILO, as Somavia's group is known, was founded by
governments, labor and employer organizations in the ``red year''
of 1919, which saw the Seattle General Strike.
</P>
<P>
   The ILO's mission is to promote international labor standards by
working within the system. Its big issues today are guaranteeing
the freedom of association and ending forced labor, child labor and
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Somavia is a Chilean who was a diplomat for the Allende
government in the 1970s, and again, for Chile's restored democracy
of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe you can shut off globalization,'' Somavia
said. ``It is a reality. But there are ways to make it much better
for people than it is now.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``What people want everywhere in the world is decent
work. This is sometimes seen as a `soft' issue. But at the risk of
appearing soft, I keep insisting on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Somavia is in Seattle to show the ILO's flag at the WTO
ministerial meetings this week. And that's a change. His
predecessor, the Belgian Michel Hansenne, was invited to the
Singapore WTO Ministerial by the Swiss but refused to go because of
the hostile views of low-wage countries.
</P>
<P>
   At that meeting, the United States and the European Union pushed
a labor agenda. The low-wage countries, who fear that labor
standards will bar their products, shunted the labor issue off to
the ILO.
</P>
<P>
   The ILO has seven key ``conventions,'' which are to be ratified
by its members. These include:
</P>
<P>
   _ A ban on forced labor, excepting military service, certain
convict labor and civil emergencies. Adopted 1930.
</P>
<P>
   _ Freedom of association and the right to form unions and
chambers of commerce independent of the state. Adopted 1948.
</P>
<P>
   _ The right to bargain collectively without interference and
punishment. Adopted 1949.
</P>
<P>
   _ Equal pay for men and women doing work of equal value. Adopted
1951.
</P>
<P>
   _ A ban on forced labor as punishment for political views or for
strikers. Adopted 1957.
</P>
<P>
   _ A ban on discrimination because of race, ethnicity, sex,
religion, or social origin. Adopted 1958.
</P>
<P>
   _ A ban on the employment of children who by law should be in
school. Adopted 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has adopted only one of these conventions, on forced
labor. The U.S. position is that the federal government cannot bind
the states. ``Our position is that this is a shame,'' said the
ILO's director of information, Michel Barton.
</P>
<P>
   He noted, however, that President Clinton is scheduled Thursday
to sign the ratification of a lesser ILO standard, abolishing the
worst forms of child labor, including child pornography and
children sold into bondage by their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the WTO, the ILO has no power to authorize sanctions. The
most it can do is to bar a member from all assistance, as it has
done with only one member, Burma, over the issue of forced labor.
</P>
<P>
   But the ILO takes itself seriously. ``We don't have sanctions,''
said Barton. ``But public opinion has many. We feed public
opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes the opinion of agencies with clout. When Indonesia
asked for billions from the International Monetary Fund, the IMF
consulted with the ILO first. As a result, said Barton, Indonesia
released labor leaders from prison.
</P>
<P>
   Another example: Next year Congress will vote on giving China
permanent access to U.S. markets on normal commercial terms.
Critics of China may turn to the ILO report on labor rights, which
declares that China, an ILO member for 80 years, is in violation of
the ILO guarantee of independent unions.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of that, the Chinese have been coming by the hundreds
to the ILO's labor institute in Italy, where labor leaders,
corporate directors of labor relations, and labor-ministry
officials learn the principles of labor relations in a modern
economy. Most of these Chinese, he said, are human resources
manages from factories in Guangdong province.

 AVIGEN'S NEW HEMOPHILIA THERAPY COULD EVENTUALLY THREATEN BAYER  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ East of Highway 80 in Berkeley, Calif., barely
visible over the trees, stands the factory where Bayer Corp.
produces one of the marvels of biotechnology, a protein drug that
hemophiliacs take to make their blood clot.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles to the south, in Alameda, Calif., tiny Avigen Inc.
is tinkering with a technology that could, one day, make Bayer's
huge, $700 million factory obsolete, by producing the same protein
with microscopic genes.
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry between Bayer and Avigen exemplifies how constant
innovation makes biotech such a costly and risky enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with Bayer, a German company that has grown beyond
the aspirin business to become a $31 billion-a-year drug and
chemical giant. Berkeley is Bayer's biotechnology headquarters,
home to 100 researchers doing early experiments on new remedies for
asthma, multiple sclerosis and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But the factory visible from Interstate 80 is Bayer's local
profit and employment engine. It keeps 1,000 people busy making
Factor 8, one of two essential blood-clotting proteins. The U.S.
market for Factor 8 products is worth about $1.3 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   Blood clots when two proteins, Factor 8 and Factor 9, combine
like an epoxy. Each of these proteins is made by a different gene.
Hemophiliacs are born without one of these two genes. They fail to
make one part of the epoxy and, thus, when they bleed, their body
can't stop the leak unless they take a drug to supply the missing
clotting factor.
</P>
<P>
   Bayer received Food and Drug Administration approval in 1993 to
sell its Factor 8 protein under the brand name Kogenate.
Previously, hemophiliacs had to take clotting factors extracted
from donated blood. In the 1980s, some of this blood was infected
with HIV or hepatitis C. Thousands of hemophiliacs got these
diseases through tainted clotting supplements.
</P>
<P>
   But Kogenate is pure Factor 8 protein, manufactured through a
fermentation process similar to winemaking, though far more
complex. Making any biotech protein is tough, but Factor 8 protein
presented a particular challenge because it is one of the largest
protein molecules in the human body, according to Michael Kamarck,
vice president of manufacturing for Bayer.
</P>
<P>
   Kamarck said the Factor 8 protein was too big to brew up in huge
batches, as is done with other biotech drugs. The very fermentation
process that produces the protein would have seen those huge Factor
8 molecules as food and would have digested the protein into an
amino acid mush.
</P>
<P>
   So Bayer perfected a way to siphon off purified Factor 8, drop
by drop, in a continuous fermentation process that Bayer thinks
could be adapted to produce other biotech proteins more
economically. ``We are looking at manufacturing as our defining
edge,'' Busse said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that presupposes protein drug manufacturing continues
to be done in traditional factories.
</P>
<P>
   But at Avigen headquarters in Alameda, scientists are working on
a gene therapy for hemophilia that could put the protein factory
where nature intended _ inside the cells of the human body.
</P>
<P>
   Every cell in your body is a microscopic factory. Genes are
segments of DNA that act like blueprints, telling the cellular
assembly line how to make each protein. Protein molecules perform
most essential functions in our bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Since hemophiliacs lack one of the two genes their cells need to
make clotting proteins, Avigen is trying to inject these missing
genes into hemophiliacs in hopes of teaching their cells how to
produce both clotting proteins.
</P>
<P>
   If Avigen succeeds, it would free hemophiliacs from the need to
take periodic doses of clotting factors made in factories like the
Bayer plant.
</P>
<P>
   But gene therapy is the cutting edge of biotechnology. More than
200 experiments have tried _ and failed _ to repair the cellular
assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   At a scientific meeting in New Orleans later this week (week of
November 28), Avigen is scheduled to reveal whether it was able to
cause blood clotting in three human hemophiliacs who received its
gene therapy injections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not saying anything until then,'' said Avigen Chief
Financial Officer Thomas J. Paulson.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of BIOSCOPE () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  But the stock has quadrupled in recent weeks as investors
anticipate that Avigen will finally succeed where all the previous
experiments have failed. Stay tuned for that news.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Avigen announces a success, it isn't as if Bayer's
factory on Interstate 80 will grind to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   Bayer makes Factor 8, the larger of the two clotting proteins.
Avigen's gene therapy is designed for hemophiliacs deficient in
Factor 9, a protein that is physically smaller than Factor 8. Using
the epoxy analogy, it takes 5 parts Factor 8 to 1 part of Factor 9
to form a clot.
</P>
<P>
   Factor 9 deficiency is also rarer, making for a smaller, $200
million market for remedies.
</P>
<P>
   So Bayer's factory and market niche are secure, until and unless
Avigen or some other firm _ Chiron is in the race as well _
succeeds in stuffing that huge Factor 8 gene into a cell and making
it work.
</P>
<P>
   Avigen is working hard on Factor 8. Earlier this month, its
scientists reported they had successfully injected Factor 8 genes
into hemophiliac mice. ``We're very hopeful we're on the right
track,'' said Alan McClelland, Avigen's vice president of research
and development.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, execs at money-losing biotech firms are congenitally
hopeful. For their part, Bayer executives note that there's a huge
difference between curing mice and curing men.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not afraid of losing the (Factor 8) market in the near
future,'' Busse said.
</P>
<P>
   His estimate may include some element of wishful thinking. Bayer
plans to spend an additional $300 million to improve its Berkeley
factory and doesn't expect to fully recoup its investments until
2006.
</P>
<P>
   If gene therapy succeeds too soon and prematurely makes the
factory obsolete, that would be a huge financial headache for
Bayer.
</P>
<P>
   GRASS ROOTS?
</P>
<P>
   Sonoma County (Calif.) organic farmer Bob Cannard is sponsoring
a ballot initiative that would give Californians a chance to
request the labeling of genetically modified foods.
</P>
<P>
   Cannard, who wrote the measure, knows any such vote would be
symbolic, because states don't control food labels. But given the
all-volunteer nature of his campaign, it would be a huge victory if
he gets the 413,000 signatures required to put the measure on the
November 2000 ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Most petition drives pay people to solicit signatures. Not
Cannard, who has bankrolled the ``campaign'' with a $5,000
contribution. He used the money to pay for a Web site
(www.calrighttoknow.org) &LR;   &LR; where people can download a copy of the
petition and print it out.
</P>
<P>
   Cannard is hoping thousands of people will visit the Web site,
download the form and become petition-gathering volunteers _ giving
a high-tech meaning to the term ``grassroots.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman at the California secretary of state's office said
this is the first time they're aware of that anyone has tried to
run a petition campaign this way.

 STARTUP DEBUTS SYSTEM THAT HOLDS 200% MORE DATA ON CD-ROMS  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A startup company whose roots are in Israel and
Russia is coming to Silicon Valley this week to show off a system
it says will dramatically increase the amount of data that can be
packed on CD-ROM-like discs and credit-card-size storage devices.
</P>
<P>
   The company, called C3D, will demonstrate discs that hold 140
gigabytes of data, more than 200 times the capacity of a CD-ROM and
almost 30 times as much as the most common DVD disc. The
credit-card-like devices will hold 10 gigabytes, almost 2,500 times
as much as similar-size cards now used to hold data in some
handheld devices.
</P>
<P>
   Products using the new technology will be ready for production
by the end of next year, C3D said. The discs won't cost any more to
produce than current CDs and will require only ``minimal
retooling'' of existing production equipment, according to the
company.
</P>
<P>
   C3D, which says it has more than 40 patents pending or granted,
hopes to bring the products to market by forming joint ventures
with major players in the storage business, but hasn't yet
disclosed the names of any partners.
</P>
<P>
   If the company can deliver on its promises, consumers in a year
or two will be able to carry on a single disc not just a single
encyclopedia, but whole libraries of reference works, and not just
one movie, but weeks' worth of entertainment. Drives capable of
reading the new format will be small, light and inexpensive enough
to fit into notebook computers and other portable devices.
</P>
<P>
   Maximum capacity, however, will be available only on
``read-only'' discs and cards that contain data that's written at
the factory and can't be modified.
</P>
<P>
   C3D's plans for next year include drives that would let users
write their own data, but those drives will have lower capacities _
4 gigabytes per disc and 1 gigabyte per card. And, initially, these
drives will allow data to be written only once on each disc or
card, with no editing permitted. Later versions of the technology
will allow rewriting at will, but the company did not set a date
for those.
</P>
<P>
   C3D is by no means the first company to make extravagant claims
for newly discovered and still unproven storage technologies, noted
analyst Jim Porter, president of Disk/Trend CQ  &LR; in Mountain View,
Calif. ``But these people aren't flakes,'' he said. ``Many of them
have been around the industry for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   C3D's general products manager, Ingolf Sander, is a former Kodak
and Verbatim executive with long experience in the optical-storage
market, according to Porter. Its president and CEO, Eugene Levich,
is a senior visiting fellow at Oxford University and also holds
teaching appointments in Israel and at the City University of New
York. Several of its 65 other employees are university professors
in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The company's chairman, Itzhak Yaakov, was formerly chief of
defense R&AMP;D for the Israeli Defense Forces, according to the C3D
Web site (www.c-3d.net). Porter said he's looking forward to
learning more about C3D's technology at a briefing the company will
hold tomorrow (November 30) in San Jose. ``The most important
technical spec is a thing called price,'' he said, and so far the
company hasn't provided details about that.
</P>
<P>
   Like today's CD and DVD technologies, C3D's system reads data by
aiming a laser beam at the storage media and then interpreting the
way different regions on the media respond to the light. But the
current technologies read the reflection of the laser light; C3D's
system instead uses the laser to activate fluorescent material
embedded within the disc or card, then interprets the light this
material generates.
</P>
<P>
   The key difference, according to C3D, is that reflecti3ons can
be interpreted only from the surface of the storage media, whereas
its system can detect and interpret fluorescent light on multiple
layers _ 10 or 20 layers in its initial products, and perhaps as
many as 100 layers in later versions. It is these extra layers that
make possible the huge increase in capacity C3D promises.
</P>
<P>
   C3D's stock has traded on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board
since April. On Friday (November 26) it jumped $2.38 to a record
high of $31.44 per share. Earlier this year its shares traded for
less than a penny.
</P>
<P>
   The company has no revenues. In a November 12 filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, C3D said it had enough money to
operate through this month, but was negotiating for the $20 million
it will require over the next 12 months. One financing plan under
consideration, according to the filing, is a private equity
offering.

 THERE'S LIFE AFTER DEATH VIA E-MAIL  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The problem with dying unexpectedly is that you
never get a chance to say goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   No longer.
</P>
<P>
   A new Web site called FinalThoughts.com allows users to write
and store adios e-mail messages to friends and family. Upon one's
demise, the messages are made available to recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Michael Krim, a 30-year-old Los Angeles attorney, said he
came up with the idea for FinalThoughts while on a flight this
March from Los Angeles to London. His plane hit heavy turbulence,
and Krim thought his number was up.
</P>
<P>
   While others in this position might see their life flash before
their eyes, not so with Krim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a need for a new service,'' he said by telephone from
his Hollywood office.
</P>
<P>
   That service isn't just e-mail from the &LR;   &LR; Great Beyond.
FinalThoughts also includes an array of estate-planning features to
ensure that Aunt Agnes gets your collection of Frankie Valli
albums, and that cousin Leo gets your Princess Diana commemorative
serving platter.
</P>
<P>
   No less importantly, the site allows you to inform your next of
kin of funeral or cremation desires, and to make sure that pets are
looked after.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is legally binding, of course. You need a proper
will for that. But Krim figures that most survivors nevertheless
will follow the e-mailed instructions of the recently departed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our service makes it convenient and easy to get organized,''
he said. ``It's a lot easier than going to an attorney.''
</P>
<P>
   Others apparently think so. Although FinalThoughts was launched
only two months ago, and there hasn't been any advertising or
marketing, word of mouth has attracted ``hundreds'' of members so
far, Krim said.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, all services at the site are free. But Krim
suggested there's a strong likelihood that, after January, new
members will be charged as much as $100 a month to have their last
wishes archived online.
</P>
<P>
   While he emphasized the humanitarian aspects of FinalThoughts,
it's clear that Krim has given a bit of thought as well to more
down-to-earth matters. He said he expects his startup Internet
company to be profitable within six months and he hopes to go
public in about a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm talking to investors and to some well-known VCs in Silicon
Valley,'' Krim said. He declined to say which ones.
</P>
<P>
   Krim previously worked as in-house counsel at InsWeb, an online
insurance service. But after his momentary brush with the Grim
Reaper while jetting to London, he has since, as he put it,
``transitioned out of the legal profession.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a fancy way of saying that Krim set up shop with his
brothers and is now working full time as president of FinalThoughts
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been entrepreneurial,'' he conceded. ``I've always
wanted my own business.''
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, he has come up with a fairly novel concept.
</P>
<P>
   After you register with FinalThoughts, you designate a
``guardian angel'' to essentially serve as executor of your last
wishes. That person receives a password to access your file in the
event of your sudden departure for the afterlife, and subsequently
clicks the appropriate button to activate your sayonara messages.
</P>
<P>
   You can enclose a form with your messages containing your
desired final arrangements. For example, users can click on whether
they want to be buried or cremated, or whether they would prefer
flowers or a donation to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Another form tells survivors where they can find your important
papers and documents, where your safety deposit box is located, and
what that extra set of keys in the kitchen drawer is for.
</P>
<P>
   Krim said the average FinalThoughts member writes between 5 and
10 messages for postmortem delivery.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent alarming recipients with out-of-the-blue goodbyes,
FinalThoughts will instead send out a generic notice informing them
that they have a message waiting at the site, with instructions for
accessing the e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, has the added benefit of driving additional
traffic to FinalThoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from membership fees, Krim said he hopes to make money by
selling advertising and seeking sponsorship for his services. He
also hopes to bring in extra revenue through e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be out of the question, he said, for FinalThoughts
to do business on the side selling caskets, for example, or
cremation urns.
</P>
<P>
   The site also will be adding capabilities for audio and video
messages, which members could create for a premium fee.
</P>
<P>
   While all this might sound like it's in dangerously bad taste,
Krim insisted that FinalThoughts is, in fact, a positive thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a death site,'' he stressed. ``Without death, you
couldn't have life. I think society is ready to talk about death
and confront death.''
</P>
<P>
   But if someone is willing to pay up to $100 a month to store
assorted adieus online, couldn't that person just as easily make
similar, legally binding arrangements with an actual lawyer?
</P>
<P>
   Krim paused before answering. ``That's something to think
about,'' he allowed.

 FROM A COFFEE SHOP IN HANOI TO TOOLBARS FOR THE INTERNET  &HT;     By JAN BOYD and STAN BUNGER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Thumb through Ly Tran's resume, and you find the
usual hints of success: undergraduate degree from Princeton,
Harvard MBA, a stint with a multinational bank.
</P>
<P>
   But Tran, co-founder of an Internet company called AtHoc, has
one bit of experience that sets him apart from the overachieving
Silicon Valley crowd. That would be his coffee-roasting business in
Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   Tran, 29, co-founded Moca Cafe three years ago. It's quite a
story.
</P>
<P>
   Tran was born in the Vietnamese beachfront town of Quin Hon. His
father served as a captain in the South Vietnamese army, and at the
end of the Vietnam War, the family fled its homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The Trans wound up in San Francisco, where Ly graduated from
Lowell High School before heading off for his Ivy League education.
After completing his Princeton degree, Tran went to work for Chase
Manhattan Bank and was assigned to a post in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   One of his jobs was to buy sand for Japanese factories, and as
fate would have it, that took him back to Quin Hon. Though he
admits he didn't speak Vietnamese particularly well, Tran says he
felt like he belonged.
</P>
<P>
   Tran quit his job with Chase and decided to become an
entrepreneur. His first deal involved an oceanfront resort at Nha
Trang, and then came Moca Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   The coffee roasting company was founded in an old French convent
in Hanoi. It now employs 50 people, and there's pride in Tran's
voice when he explains what a steady paycheck means to those
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Moca Cafe generates a modest profit: about $10,000 a month. But
Tran believes the venture has given him the sort of education money
can't buy. ``Operating in the highly unregulated third world
environment has taught me a lot about entrepreneurship,'' said
Tran.
</P>
<P>
   Once Moca Cafe was up and running, Tran decided to return to the
states and do what every young entrepreneur does: Go to business
school.
</P>
<P>
   While completing his MBA at Harvard, he met Israeli entrepreneur
Guy Miasnik and the two decided to cash in on the Internet boom.
</P>
<P>
   Their San Francisco company, AtHoc, uses technology developed in
Israel to improve on the personal toolbars on Web browsers.
Existing toolbars let users jump to specific sites without typing
in a Web address.
</P>
<P>
   AtHoc's toolbar lets users set up shortcuts that take them deep
within Web sites with just one click. The company has cut deals
with several Web sites to create branded versions of its toolbar.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one partner is Raging Bull, an online investor
information site. A Raging Bull patron could set up a shortcut to
Microsoft's stock price. Clicking on that icon on the toolbar would
automatically take the user from the browser to the Raging Bull
page that displays Microsoft's stock price _ saving a few interim
steps.
</P>
<P>
   Tran thinks his company has a bright future. But if things don't
work out, there's always that coffee thing to fall back on.
</P>
<P>
   CAD ARTISTS: Some of the best work being done at Hewlett-Packard
happens after hours every Tuesday night. Jim White, a longtime
engineer, unlocks the door to a corporate training room and lets in
Tom Bakey and his students.
</P>
<P>
   The students, about a dozen disabled children and adults, find a
spot in front of a computer and sit down next to a volunteer. They
watch attentively as Bakey stands at the front of the room with a
felt pen and quickly sketches a dolphin. Then the fun begins.
</P>
<P>
   Russell _ sitting in the second row, wearing a cowboy hat
adorned with tinsel, various buttons, a jack-in-the-box ball, an
eagle and a big plastic rat _ quickly moves through a Windows paint
program. He clicks and drags lines around the screen until a
dolphin appears.
</P>
<P>
   Russell sometimes has a little trouble counting past three, but
the paint program is a snap. He can create a full-screen view of a
Hawaiian beach or a detailed scene of the Tech Museum and downtown
San Jose. He's also working on a series of cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Vanessa, who has been attending the class for several
years, works on creating the dolphin's arch. When Vanessa first
came to the class, she was so reserved she didn't move or talk
during the session. Now she laughs with her volunteer tutor as they
struggle to make the line arc gracefully. Bakey comes by and
encourages Vanessa to try again.
</P>
<P>
   Another volunteer whispers that Bakey challenges the students to
push themselves; if the drawing doesn't look like a dolphin, he
tells them so, no matter what their disability. And the students
respond. In fact, these CAD artists have gotten so good that some
of their drawings have appeared on the cover of brochures or as
posters. And once a month, a small group travels with Bakey to the
San Jose Tech Museum, where they teach nondisabled children how to
create computer drawings.
</P>
<P>
   Russell finishes his drawing in record time and starts talking
with Brian Cardello, a photographer for New Media News who's
shooting Russell's work. While the two chat about the color of the
sky at the horizon line, Bakey shares one of his favorite stories
about his students.
</P>
<P>
   The CAD artists, who designed the artwork in a brochure for a
local multimedia design conference, attended the event. During the
conference, a speaker, unaware that the art was created by disabled
students, pointed to the brochure as an example of computer art of
the future. Later, an executive vice president from Disney, also
unaware of the students' background, walked up to Russell to
congratulate him on his work. `'Did you use clip art?'' he
inquired. ``No,'' responded Russell, ``I'm an artist.''
</P>
<P>

to draw your own dolphin, at CADartists.org.

RAGE _ (PHOENIX) Gregory Francis Schmidt could spend 25 years
behind bars for not controlling his anger when a truck cut him off
on the Black Canyon Freeway last year. Instead of handling it as a
daily irritation on a Phoenix-area Valley freeway, Schmidt squeezed
off eight shots. In an instant, Gillis Champagne, 21, a passenger
in the truck, was dead. A bullet passed through his neck, severing
an artery. The Phoenix area is a hotbed for such hotheaded drivers,
and prosecutors and judges in Maricopa County show no mercy for
such violent reactions. Prison sentences are sought for anyone who
flashes or uses a gun on a roadway. When he is sentenced in
January, Schmidt, 29, can expect to join a string of Phoenix-area
men spending decades in prison because of a flash of fury behind
the wheel. By VICTORIA HARKER. Story will move in the ``A''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
HISPANIC-CENSUS _ (PHOENIX) Seven months after Arizona Gov. Jane
Hull signed a law that governs how boundaries for Arizona voting
districts are drawn, local and national Hispanic leaders remain
hopeful that it will be struck down on the basis that it weakens
the political power of Latinos and other people of color. A score
of national civil rights groups and Hispanic politicians, mostly
Democrats, contend that the U.S. Justice Department should block
the law, which requires the Arizona Legislature to use exact head
counts in redrawing political boundaries after 2000. Critics say an
exact head count is a flawed method that was shown to undercount
Hispanics by more than 1 million people during the 1990 census. By

 &QL; 
TV-GOODY (UNDATED) _ If you're searching for a television heroine,

you to the screen in American Hollow, the excellent HBO documentary
produced and directed by Rory Kennedy, in a way whippet-thin
Hollywood actresses only wish they could manage. By BILL

   &QL; 
``DESERT'' &QL; 
Photos by Jack Dykinga, text by Janice Emily Bowers (Abrams,
$49.50) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This book offers lots of pretty photographs of the Mojave Desert
in which Dykinga seems to concede (appearances on the cover
notwithstanding) that not everything in the rural Southwest is
fluorescent orange. The big draw for us, however, is Janice Emily
Bowers, who lives near Tucson and who has written lovely essays
(``A Full Life in a Small Place'') about the natural wonders there.
Both writer and photographer were assisted by the rains &QL; 
of El Nino during the winter of 1997-1998, which brought the desert
into abundant bloom and made their jobs even more pleasurable than
they'd expected them to be. Tourists came from far away to see the
flowers that spring, many for the first time. Bowers envied them.
``The first time of seeing the desert in bloom is almost painful in
its intensity,'' she writes, ``as if every flower were a needle
piercing your skin or a chunk of ice pressed onto your flesh. I
wanted to join that spring, as if it were a circus, and travel with
it forever.'' She acknowledges that this book might attract more
tourists, which increases her concern over the beautiful,
vulnerable desert. Are the crowds good or bad? ``Sometimes,'' she
writes, ``I don't know which group worries me most: the millions
who visit or the millions who stay away.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``ATLANTIS FOUND'' &QL; 
By Clive Cussler (Putnam, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is what Clive Cussler says about his appeal as a writer:
``I give people what they want. My books are like an old Saturday
afternoon matinee with easily identifiable characters: the big
rugged hero; the shrewd heroine (who is never a bimbo); the nasty
villain who gets it in the end . . . I never mean for it to be
anything more than entertainment.'' His sprawling novel features
his recurring big rugged hero, Dirk Pitt, who is supremely capable
and ever manly but a bit on the stiff side (he's like James Bond
without the panache). His shrewd heroine who isn't a bimbo is Pat
O'Connell, an expert in ancient languages. And the villains? There
are so many, and they fall all over themselves trying to kill
O'Connell and her colleagues and then Pitt, who makes a Bond-like
entrance and rescues them from drowning in flooded tunnels under a
mountain in Colorado. One of the assassins shows up in a ninja suit
and a ski mask, and even though he has a chest wound and is
bleeding from the mouth, he calmly discusses his motives with Pitt
before swallowing a cyanide capsule _ a Saturday matinee touch if
we've ever seen one. The plot here is impossible to describe
because it's more a collection of parts than a cohesive whole.
Among the elements: a comet that crashed into the Earth 9,000 years
ago; a frozen ghost ship discovered near the South Pole in 1858; an
underground chamber with inscriptions on its walls and a black
skull on a pedestal; a Nazi U-boat that attacks Pitt's research
vessel; and a cameo appearance by Cussler himself (a Hitchcockian
tradition that he has added to his novels). We'll let you guess who
triumphs before the final credits roll.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
``WITH WILDER'' &QL; 
By Cameron Crowe (Knopf, $35) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is a wonderful book, not just for film buffs but for those
of us who believe in preserving the stories of people who have had
long and eventful lives. That's an understated description of
director Billy Wilder, of course, but it's the spirit in which this
volume was written. In 1995, Crowe, who had adapted his book ``Fast
Times at Ridgemont High'' for film and had written and directed
``Say Anything,'' approached Wilder and asked the 89-year-old
director to play a bit part in his next movie, ``Jerry Maguire.''
Wilder said no, even when Crowe came back with Tom Cruise, who
turned on the high beams and begged. Crowe wrote about Wilder's
rebuff for ``Rolling Stone.'' Wilder read and liked the story, and
he agreed to an interview with Crowe, a project that expanded to
become this book. In question-and-answer format, Wilder talks about
working with actors (Jack Lemmon, Gary Cooper, Audrey Hepburn,
Marilyn Monroe, Cary Grant, Barbara Stanwyck, Greta Garbo), his
films (``Some Like It Hot,'' ``The Apartment,'' ``Ace in the
Hole,'' ``Sunset Boulevard''), other directors and his big
inspiration, Ernst Lubitsch. There are anecdotes on every page, and
no pretense in sight. The interviews, conducted by Crowe with the
persistence of a journalist and the giddy curiosity of a fan, took
place over more than a year, ending in 1998, when Wilder was 91. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``A PASSION FOR BOOKS'' &QL; 
Edited by Harold Rabinowitz and Rob Kaplan (Times, $27.50) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an essay written in 1981, Anatole Broyard laments the fact
that his friends borrow his books because he has more than most
people, never mind that ``I feel about lending a book the way most
fathers feel about their daughters living with a man out of
wedlock.'' Robertson Davies writes about the idiosyncrasies of book
collecting. Anna Quindlen offers a list of ``The Ten Books One
Would Save in a Fire, If One Could Save Only Ten.'' John Updike
bemoans the gray fluff of book envelopes. Robert Benchley wonders
why no one collects his books (this was in 1934 _ things have
changed). Norman Mailer names his favorite American novels: not one
of them was written by him. This collection is for people who know
what Peter Hamill was talking about when he said this: ``There are
10,000 books in my library, and it will keep growing until I die.
This has exasperated my daughters, amused my friends, and baffled
my accountant. If I had not picked up this habit in the library
long ago, I would have more money in the bank today. I would not be
richer.'' &QL;

ANDERSON NOW IN SICK BAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In toasting the return of Maurice Taylor, the Los Angeles
Clippers must bow to the misfortune of franchise protocol by
drinking from a half-empty cup.
</P>
<P>
   The premature gulp was in honor of Derek Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who has just finished a three-game recovery after
missing the previous three games by virtue of concussion, did not
attend Sunday's practice. His lingering sinus problem seemed to
reach its full potential during Saturday night's 88-71 stinker
against Portland, during which Anderson struggled for 6 points.
</P>
<P>
   Playing on post-concussion fumes the previous two games,
Anderson had ripped New York for 23 and Seattle for a season-high
29.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave him some medication so he can get some rest,'' Coach
Chris Ford of Anderson, who is not expected to practice today and
seems like a shaky bet for Tuesday's game vs. the tempo-maniacal
Phoenix Suns at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   At least Taylor is making a vigorous attempt to be ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good, I felt great,'' said Taylor, who talks as if the
sprain of his left foot is healing with every few words. ``I was
excited to get back out there and play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clipper power forward injured the foot two weeks ago at
Vancouver and has been sidelined for 7} games since. Sunday's
workout marked his return to a team that has won half of its last 6
games (4-9 overall), but lost its last 2.
</P>
<P>
   In attempting to accelerate the pace of his conditioning, Taylor
was in full attack mode during a full-court scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not bad,'' said Ford when asked for a first-sight appraisal of
the third-year Clipper who averages 16 points and 5 rebounds. ``He
seemed pretty lively. But he just can't come in and jack up the
ball every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor took the jibe in stride - and without a limp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an aggressive attitude,'' he said, making no apologies
for his hunger to score. ``I wanted to make it seem as game-like as
possible. But I know that when I get back in a real game situation,
after the first two trips down the court, I'll be tired as hell.''
</P>
<P>
   At least the Clippers, who have been wasting possessions on
3-point scuds, now have a low-post option to take the heat off of
rookie forward Lamar Odom and center Michael Olowokandi.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's carried too much of a burden,'' Taylor said of
Olowokandi, but the judgment goes double for Odom, who will be
double-teamed less with Mo in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   But this doesn't mean Ford and Taylor will abandon a rising,
pre-injury strategy that would allow the 6-8 power forward to step
out, face the basket and take bigger foes to the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``That helps me, because they can't double me as easily,''
Taylor said. ``He (Ford) told me `Just don't get jump-shot happy.'
But I know where I get paid - it's on the blocks.''

their pristine waterways and tourists who flood their downtown,
residents of Alaska's capital approved a $5 tax on every passenger
last month. The small town of Haines voted to limit the number of
cruise ships allowed at its dock. And several people have suggested
publicly that one cruise line be barred from the state's waters.

WTO'S MOORE URGES LABOR TO BE OPEN TO TRADE EXPANSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The head of the World Trade Organization reached out
to the world's union leaders yesterday, urging them to view trade
expansion as a tool to create jobs and boost economies.
</P>
<P>
   WTO director-general Mike Moore said labor groups shouldn't view
the growth of trade as a threat. The growth will give a boost to
the global economy, helping to create jobs, according to Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade is the ally of working people, not their enemy,'' Moore
said in a speech to the International Confederation of Free Trade
Unions at Bell Harbor Conference Center.
</P>
<P>
   Moore cited economic data that said exports surged by 51 percent
in the United States in the last six years, accounting for a
quarter of the nation's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The role of organized labor in the creation of global trade
rules promises to be one of the most controversial issues at this
week's WTO ministerial meeting. Unions from around the world are
gathering here this week to press the trade body for more
influence.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders say they want more than promises from the 135
member nations. They want trade ministers to stitch commitments to
labor standards _ such as the right of workers to organize _ into
the mandate that guides the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   If the trade group ignores the demands of unions they risk
losing both influence and power, said Bill Jordan, general
secretary of the International Confederation of Free Trade, a labor
group meeting here alongside the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   It ``could well be (the) beginning of the end of the WTO if they
ignore'' labor, he added.
</P>
<P>
   But Moore called for a truce in the dispute between free-trade
and labor activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is destructive because it obscures the underlying consensus
that exists about the social problems all countries face,'' Moore
said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore admitted the WTO is ``not perfect. It can be improved, but
the world would be a more unstable and more dangerous place without
it.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, even though some nations are enjoying healthy
economies, not everyone is benefiting from the prosperity, Moore
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day companies announce their highest profits, and the next
a thousand layoffs,'' Moore said. ``People want answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman voiced the Clinton
administration's support of some of the labor movement's demands.
Also speaking at yesterday's meeting, Herman said the WTO should
open its doors, at least at certain times, to organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to ensure that you have access to the deliberations,''
Herman told the labor representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is walking a fine line this week
between President Clinton's support of free-trade policies and the
traditional alliance between U.S. unions and the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton already has suggested that the WTO should create a
working group to examine the intersection of trade and labor
issues.
</P>
<P>
   But some union leaders say that isn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking for a process to address issues of core labor
standards,'' John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, said
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   In Moore, unions at least have an official who was sympathetic
to their concerns in the past, when he served in the New Zealand
government as a member of the Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe he is attempting to address the issues we have
raised,'' Sweeney said.

GOVERNING PARTY CANDIDATE WINS PRESIDENCY IN URUGUAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout) 
 (sw3) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay _ The candidate of the governing Colorado
Party won the Uruguayan presidency on his fifth try on Sunday by
beating back a strong challenge from a leftist coalition that
included Socialists, Communists and former guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Batlle, the governing party candidate, promised in his
campaign to pursue a vigorous foreign policy that would open
markets for Uruguay's dairy and wool products and to improve
educational opportunities by broadly expanding computer and
internet access.
</P>
<P>
   But what caught the attention of analysts throughout Latin
America was the impressive showing by Batlle's challenger, Tabare
Vazquez, the former mayor of Montevideo, the capital. Vazquez, an
oncologist, challenged the free-enterprise policies that are now
fashionable around the region and pledged an aggressive campaign
against poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Late on Sunday night, with all the ballots counted, the Interior
Ministry said Batlle, a 72-year-old former senator known for
bluntly speaking his mind, had won 1,138,067 votes, or 52 percent.
Vazquez, 59, won 972,197 votes, or 44 percent, with the rest of the
2.2 million ballots either annulled or blank.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Vazquez's Broad Front party could claim a victory
of sorts since it won the largest bloc of votes in the Uruguayan
Congress in the Oct. 31 first-round balloting.
</P>
<P>
   In his victory speech, Batlle promised to lead ``a government
with the active participation of all the people to promote the
ideals of democracy, tolerance and liberty.'' Vazquez conceded
defeat, saying, ``We accept the decision of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Batlle was able to defeat Vazquez by forming an alliance with
the center-right National Party three weeks ago, so the two
traditional parties that have dominated this tiny country of 3.2
million people for most of the last 150 years will now form a
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   Batlle (pronounced BAH-jay) has been a candidate four times
before, in 1966, 1971, 1989 and 1994, but he lost to other Colorado
or opposition candidates under a previous system that combined
primary votes with the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Batlle is likely to follow the policies of the current
president, Julio Maria Sanguinetti, of seeking out more foreign
investment for the tourism industry and cautiously privatizing some
government services to cut a bloated bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Uruguay is well behind neighboring Argentina and most other
Latin American countries in privatizing industry because its voters
continue their strong support for welfare-state policies that go
back to the presidency of Batlle's grand-uncle at the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   In a historical twist, it is the Tupamaros, the former
guerrillas, and other left-wing groups that once attacked Uruguay's
social democracy as a liberal trick to subdue the masses that now
most strongly defend the cradle-to-grave welfare state.
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez led in the polls for most of the last year, but
previously undecided voters appeared to be swayed by a Batlle media
blitz in the final weeks of the campaign suggesting that a leftist
victory would mean higher income taxes and economic and political
instability.
</P>
<P>
   But Vazquez's strong showing, combined with his winning a
plurality in the first round of voting, has put the two traditional
parties on notice that voters are growing restless with what is
widely perceived as their uncreative leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The Broad Front has become increasingly popular since it was
founded 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez was able to tap into growing popular frustration with a
recession that has left 11 percent of the work force unemployed and
an economy that shrank this year, instead of growing.

L.A. GETS HOSTILE OVER HOLLYWOOD SECESSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LEE CONDON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles city leaders said they will fight a
proposal by Hollywood residents and business owners to break away
and form their own city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they should go out to the desert and start their own
city,'' said Los Angeles City Council President John Ferraro, who
represents the western parts of Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a bad idea to break up the city,'' said Ferraro,
who also opposes the cityhood bids by residents in the San Fernando
Valley and San Pedro-Wilmington. ``I don't know if they are
elitists who are just trying to get away from the problems we have
in the city or what.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan will fight secession in Hollywood, just as
he has argued against the Valley and Harbor area efforts, said his
chief of staff, Kelly Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't think it's a good idea for the city to break up,''
Martin said. ``We're very concerned about secession already, and
having more different groups who express a desire to secede is
troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend, members of a group
calling itself Hollywood VOTE _ after Valley Voters Organized
Toward Empowerment, the group backing the San Fernando Valley
cityhood effort _ announced their plans to make Hollywood an
independent city.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the group said they want to piggyback onto secession
efforts already under way in the Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could conceivably be on the ballot for cityhood with the
Valley and Harbor votes,'' said Mitchell Green, a lawyer who is one
of the leaders of Hollywood VOTE. ``If we don't do it at this time,
the opportunity will be lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Brain, president of Valley VOTE, agreed that the timing is
right for Hollywood to try to break away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It demonstrates the discontent, not just in the Valley or San
Pedro, that Los Angeles residents have about the quality of life
and leadership in Los Angeles,'' he said, adding that other
communities may join the breakup movement.
</P>
<P>
   Brain said about two-thirds of the LAFCO study involves taking
an inventory of the assets of the city of Los Angeles. Since that
study is already being done for the Valley and San Pedro, it will
not be too difficult for LAFCO to add Hollywood to the analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Green said Hollywood VOTE was created about four weeks ago and
has 15 core members. The group currently only has cash on hand to
cover operating expenses, but Green said supporters have pledged to
give $40,000 to launch a petition drive to force a secession study
in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   A signature-collection drive could begin in mid-January, Green
said.
</P>
<P>
   Secession leaders in the Valley and San Pedro have already
completed petition drives to force studies of the financial effects
of breaking apart Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Local Agency Formation Commission is expected to begin the
analyses in March. It could take about two years to complete.
</P>
<P>
   LAFCO would then hold hearings on the proposal to break up Los
Angeles before placing it on a citywide ballot. A majority in the
city and the detaching areas would have to approve the proposals
before the Valley and San Pedro could become independent cities.
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood residents contend smaller cities in Los Angeles
County _ Beverly Hills, West Hollywood and Santa Monica, for
example _ are run better and are more successful at meeting the
needs of businesses and homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we can make it a lot better place for people who
live here, who work here and visit here,'' said Fares Wehbe, the
financial director at the Little Red School House and a longtime
Hollywood resident.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Hollywood cityhood proponents say most outsiders think
Hollywood is a separate city already, rather than a part of Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Already we are an internationally known city that doesn't
actually exist,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood group has yet to finalize the borders of its
independent city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of still casting our net to see which communities
are interested in joining us,'' Wehbe said.
</P>
<P>
   However, members suggested the border could go as far east as
the intersection of Riverside Drive and Hyperion Avenue. Under that
scenario the new city would include not only Hollywood but also
large parts of Los Feliz and Silver Lake.
</P>
<P>
   The southern border would be Melrose Avenue. On the west, the
new city could stretch all the way to La Cienega Boulevard. The new
city may also take in the Hollywood Hills, stretching all the way
up to Mulholland Drive.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, Riordan's chief of staff, said it is not clear whether
the secession movements will gain popular support at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all of these areas you have a relatively small group of
people organizing the efforts. I don't think the people have voted
to say goodbye yet,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said the Valley and San Pedro proposals are already in
conflict because the two communities have different ideas about how
to split up the assets of Los Angeles. Adding Hollywood into the
equation could confuse voters even more. ``Maybe these communities
will all vote for one another. Or maybe everybody throws their
hands in the air and says it can't be done,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its worldwide fame, the community of Hollywood has
struggled for decades to live up to the expectations of the
millions of tourists who flock there every year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite several revitalization efforts, Hollywood has been
unable to recapture the magic of its early years as the city's
movie glamour centerpiece.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ferraro noted that Hollywood is finally back on the
right track. Several major projects are in the works, including a
city-assisted $300million development at Hollywood Boulevard and
Highland Avenue by Trizec-Hahn Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The city is contributing $90million in public funds for an
underground parking garage and a 3,300 seat, live-broadcast theater
that will serve as the new home for the Academy Awards telecast
starting in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood was dormant for a long time. It's now coming back,''
Ferraro said. ``Hollywood is a great asset for the city of Los
Angeles, and we have to do everything we can to promote it.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the effort is still in its formative stage, it has a fan
in vamp screen star and longtime Hollywood resident Elvira.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish Hollywood would (become its own city) because all the
money that comes in wouldn't go downtown. Millions of people come
here, and what's on Hollywood Boulevard? Nothing,'' she said at
Sunday's Hollywood Christmas Parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish Hollywood would secede. It would be my dream come
true.''
