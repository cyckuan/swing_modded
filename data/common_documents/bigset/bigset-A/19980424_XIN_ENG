<HEADLINE> Five Skinheads Face Murder Charge in B.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Five white supremacits have been
charged with beating a Sikh caretaker to death in the Canadian
province of British Columbia (B.C.), reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
All of the five, who aged from 17 to 25 years old and had
shaved heads, belong to a group known as White Power, which is
aligned with other white supremacist groups like Aryan Nations,
police said.
</P>
<P>
They were charged in provincial court with second-degree murder
in the January attack, in which the 65-year-old Sikh was
bludgeoned to death in the parking lot of a Sikh temple in the
Vancouver suburb of Surrey.
</P>
<P>
The killing might have been motivated by racial hatred, alleged
the police who are involved in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
The revelations of the murder came as a shock to some people in
Canada's west coast province.
</P>
<P>
"People knew racism was out there, but this is very
frightening," Rattan Mall, editor of a major Indo-Canadian
newspaper in Vancouver, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The slaying was "the tip of the iceberg" of hate crimes and
British Columbia has become a haven for those who commit such
crimes, noted anti-racist Allan Dutton.
</P>
<P>
Racists are moving to B.C. because the province has never
launched a prosecution under the section of the Criminal Code of
Canada dealing with hate propaganda or advocating genocide, Dutton
added.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that about 200 British Columbians are involved in
white, racist groups and an additional 2,000 are directly
connected to these organizations.
</P>
<P>
Dutton called for tougher laws to deal with race hatred, such
as making possession of hate literature a crime.
</P>
<P>
According to Peter Beaudin, executive director of the B.C.
Human Rights Coalition, there has been "a rising climate of
intolerance for the last 18 months in B.C.."
</P>
<P>
A decade of heavy immigration and a deepening economic downturn
now has contributed to increased anger and backlash in the
Vancouver region.

<HEADLINE> 25th Victim of Human BSE Dies in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Clare Tomkins, a 24-year-old
vegetarian, has become the 25th victim of the human version of BSE
and died in Britain Wednesday, a national newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Tomkins, who was from East Peckham, Kent,
and had been a vegetarian since 1985, fell ill in the Autumn of
1996.
</P>
<P>
After undergoing months of tests and treatment at several
hospitals, she was finally diagnosed as suffering from the new
variant CJD, which was linked two years ago to BSE in cattle, or
mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
During her illness, she lost weight and degenerated into a
tormented patient, racked by involuntary movements, unable to walk
unaided. Before her death, she was bed-bound, needing
round-the-clock nursing.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that her case may show that how long the
incubation period for the disease can be since she ate
beefburgers, hot dogs and other meat before she became a
vegetarian.

<HEADLINE> Health Care Ills Threaten Canada: Pollster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A national health-care crisis
instead of Quebec separation is the most difficult problem Canada
will face over the next decade, according to pollster Angus Reid.
</P>
<P>
"Everything I look at tells me Canada is likely to survive 10
years from now. It is highly unlikely we are going to have a
separate Quebec," Reid was quoted as saying by reports Thursday.
</P>
<P>
What could really tear Canada apart in the new millennium is
the gradual erosion of something as fundamental as public health
care, said Reid, chief executive of the Angus Reid Group.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Canadians are most proud of their health-care
system. But an ever-growing number of people are getting more
about the health of the system, which is rapidly going downhill.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in a decade, health care has emerged as the
number one priority for Canadians.
</P>
<P>
"It's very likely we could find ourselves winning the battle
for Quebec but losing a broader war for the country, the battle
for our souls," he warned.

<HEADLINE> German Parliament Approves Adoption of Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The lower house of the German
parliament, the Bundestag, Thursday gave overwhelming approval to
the country's adoption of the single European currency euro from
January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The decision was approved by a vote of 575 to 35, with five
abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Most parliamentary members of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
ruling coalition as well as the opposition Social Democratic Party
(SPD) and the Greens voted for the decision, while the Party of
Democratic Socialism (PDS) voted against and called for a
long-term delay in the euro launch.
</P>
<P>
Technically, Germany's adoption of the euro has still to get a
final approval from the upper house of the parliament, the
Bundesrat, which is due to vote on the issue on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Given the broad support from almost all the 16 state
governments whose representatives form the Bundesrat, that
approval is believed to be virtually certain.

<HEADLINE> Five IRA Prisoners to Be Transferred to Irish Jails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The British government agreed on
Thursday to transfer five IRA members serving sentences for murder
to prisons in the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Jack Straw had agreed to the transfer, which
will be made shortly, under a Council of Europe convention on the
transfer of prisoners to their home countries, the Prison Service
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The service said the move was not directly related to the
Northern Irish peace deal, which could set free in the next two
years all jailed prisoners belonging to different political
parties in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Four of the prisoners were members of the so-called Balcombe
Street terrorist gang, who held a middle-aged couple hostage in
their central London home for six days in 1975 before they were
arrested. They are serving life sentences for two murders and
several bomb and gun attacks on the British mainland.
</P>
<P>
The fifth prisoner to be transferred is Paul Magee, who was
convicted of the murder of part-time policeman Glenn Goodman in
Yorkshire, northern England, in 1992.

HARARE, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Norwegian government has
through its embassy in Harare launched a risk capital fund to
benefit joint ventures between Norwegian companies and those in
five southern African countries, the Zimbabwe News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian Risk Capital Fund for Developing Countries
(NORFUND), launched by chairman Arve Johnsen on Thursday in
Zimbabwe's second largest city of Bulawayo, was allocated 30
million U.S. Dollars for this year.
</P>
<P>
It would benefit companies in Angola, Mozambique, South
Africa, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said Zimbabwe's share would depend on interest
shown by both Norwegian and Zimbabwean companies in joint
investment.
</P>
<P>
NORFUND would provide capital at an ownership share of between
35 percent and 49 percent of any business.
</P>
<P>
It would also privide loans, facilitate contact with
international financing bodies and act as a resource centre and
advisory board for beneficiaries.

<HEADLINE> Mkapa Denounces Detractors of Zimbabwean Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa Thursday urged Zimbabweans to guard against
enemies of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic
Front (ZANU-PF) who despise their own independence.
</P>
<P>
He was addressing a ZANU-PF rally at Manama Business Center in
Mhondoro, southwest of Harare, after touring a multi-million
Dollar irrigation scheme in the area, the Zimbabwe News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said most whites were against black majority rule during
Zimbabwe's protracted liberation war, and would try to manipulate
other black people to destabilize the country.
</P>
<P>
"Don't be misled by them," he said, adding "They pretend to
offer systems and different models of government they think you
should establish."
</P>
<P>
"These models are inconsis;27t with what we fought for. Reject
their campaigns of slander and stand firm by your government," he
urged.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian president praised Zimbabwe's land resettlement
program, saying it would ensure millions of the deprived to
improve their livelihood and restore their lost dignity.
</P>
<P>
He assured the support from Tanzania's ruling Chama Chama
Pinduzi party to Zimbabwe for the program.
</P>
<P>
According to Mkapa, the current visit will accord him a chance
to promote investment and trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe urged ZANU-PF members to
guard against exploitation by people working in the interests of
the enemy.
</P>
<P>
By June this year the majority of Zimbabweans would have
realised the practical benefits of government's efforts in trying
to resolve racial imbalances brought about by the colonial
governments, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This situation cannot be allowed to continue where we have
the greater part of our population living congested in the
communal areas," Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa, who is on a four-day official visit to Zimbabwe, is
scheduled to open the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair on
Friday.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 23 (Xinhua) -- South African police have
arrested 117 Nigerians for drug trafficking in a suburb of the
commercial center of Johannesburg, Southern African Broadcasting
Association reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
From January 1997 to March this year, the majority of drug
dealers in Hillbrow, a crime-laden suburb of Johannesburg, have
been Nigerians, according to Sharma Maharaj, a police
commissioner for Gauteng Province, where Johannesburg is located.
</P>
<P>
Police have a difficult task to combat drug dealers because of
a shortage of anti-drug personnel, Maharaj said. There are only
22 narcotics bureau members in Johannesburg, while the residents
in Hillbrow alone exceed one million.
</P>
<P>
Owners of apartment blocks and hotels in the area are
cooperating with drug pushers and they alert the dealers about
police raids, Maharaj said.
</P>
<P>
He said drugs are brought into the country mainly through
Johannesburg International Airport and Lanseria Airport, west of
Johannesburg.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said on Thursday that sustainable economic development
is essential to preventing conflict.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at Rice University of Houston on the last
leg of his West United States trip which began on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Taking Rwanda, Bosnia and Cambodia as the cases of "deadly
conflict" with heavy casualties, Annan said the last decade's
intra-state and ethnic wars have made a Chinese proverb "all too
real for our time".
</P>
<P>
The proverb says it is difficult to find money for medicine,
but easy to find it for a coffin.
</P>
<P>
"For the United Nations, there is no higher goal, no deeper
commitment and no greater ambition than preventing armed
conflict," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, prevention will succeed only if the root
causes of conflict are addressed.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty, endemic under-development and weak or non-existent
institutions inhibit dialogue and invite the resort to violence,"
the Secretary-General said.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Company to Advise Jordan on Privatizing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's investment bank, EFG
Hermes, Thursday signed an agreement with the Jordanian
government to supervise the sale of 33 percent of the state's
shares in Jordan Cement Factories.
</P>
<P>
By the partial sale of the state's 49.5 percent ownership of
the profit-making private company's total shares, the government
expects to attract foreign capitals to help the company develop
its production capacity and increase its profits, Jordan's
official news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The private company recorded 11.9 million Jordanian dinars
(about 16.8 million U.S. dollars) in net profits in 1997, but the
results were far from the government's expectations, the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
The sale is in line with the government's privatization policy
aimed at strengthening the national economy through giving a
larger role to the private sector and attracting foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
Jordan Cement Factories is the second Jordanian company, where
the government's shares are to be sold to the private sector or
foreign investors under the kingdom's privatization plans. The
first is the Jordan Telecommunications Company.
</P>
<P>
Still on the privatization agenda are companies in
transportation, water and railway sectors.

<P>
Rwandan Government this morning announced that it intends to
execute, by firing squad and in public, more than 20 persons found
guilty of the genocide in the country in 1994.
</P>
<P>
While condemning the genocide in the strongest terms in a
statement, Robinson said the decision of the Government would have
negative impact on the process of reconciliation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Commissioner said she was concerned that the public
nature of the proposed execution would have a brutalizing effect
in a population already traumatized by the genocide of 1994 and
the continuing insecurity in the country.
</P>
<P>
Robinson said such public killings could promote feelings of
revenge rather than contribute to the process of national
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
She said her Office would remain committed to working with the
Government and the people of Rwanda to improve understandings of

judicial system and to support any other measures which could
contribute to national reconciliation and reconstruction.

MOSCOW, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The plenary meeting of the
Communist Party of Russian Federation (CPRF) made a decision on
Thursday to vote against Sergei Kiriyenko's candidacy for
premiereship in the third ballot on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency quoted Communist leader Gennady

The CPRF Central Committee has instructed its members in the

Communists will refuse to vote at all, the plenary meeting ruled.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma turned down the premiership candidacy twice over

<P>
LONDON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Fraud and error are costing the
European Union (EU) three billion pounds (about five billion U.S.
dollars) every year, according to a government watchdog report.
</P>
<P>
A report from the National Audit Office, published Thursday,
said that wastage makes up five percent of the EU's 60 billion
pounds (about 100 billion dollars) annual budget.
</P>
<P>
Among the errors cited in the report were 46,000 calves
slaughtered under a scheme to restrict veal supplies without
checks on whether the meat was properly disposed of.
</P>
<P>
John Bourn, head of National Audit Office, said that the level
of fraud identified by the European Court of Auditors "is a matter
for serious concern."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the implementation of a range of schemes
operated under the EU Common Agriculture Policy, including
premiums for the slaughter of cattle, has resulted in farmers
receiving more as well as less than their entitlement.
</P>
<P>
The report also expressed concern over the level of "errors"
found in payments from structural funds provided for regional
projects and called on the EU to produce clearer and simplified
budget statements with more accessible financial information.

According to the reports, the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities in Cyprus along with Greece and Turkey would be
invited to attend a meeting in an effort to reach a solution to
the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The reports were also dismissed Tuesday by Foreign Minister
Ioannis Kasoulides, who stressed that the Cypriot government is
aimed at the resumption of negotiations to settle the Cyprus
problem as early as possible, under U.N. aegis and based on the
international body's resolutions on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Miller was in Cyprus on Monday and met with both Clerides and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash before the forthcoming visit
here by U.S. presidential emissary Richard Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Christos Stylianides confirmed here
Thursday that Holbrooke will arrive here on May 1.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that the Cypriot government has not been
informed of a possible visit to Cyprus by U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkey landed its troops and took over
the northern third of the island following a failed pro-Athens
coup in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Recaptures Fugitive Child Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Belgian police recaptured
the country's alleged child killer a few hours after he had run
away from court on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The fugitive paedophile, identified as Marc Dutroux, was caught
in southeastern Belgium, close to the borders with Luxembourg and
France, police sources said.
</P>
<P>
The alleged child killer managed to run away from one police
guard in court at Neufchateau and started his run in a stolen car
toward the borders of Luxembourg and France.
</P>
<P>
Belgian police had to seal off the borders while the French
police did the same on their side of the border. Police in five
countries were mobilized to join the manhunt.
</P>
<P>
Dutroux was accused of killing four of the six young girls he
had abducted in mid 1996 as a nation-wide child sex ring was
exposed and shocked the Belgian public.
</P>
<P>
The lower house of the Belgian Parliament adjoined its
afternoon session to press the cabinet for an explanation for the
runaway of the alleged child killer.
</P>
<P>
The senate also pressed for an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
There are usually two armed gendarmes on duty to guard such an
alleged criminal in court but there was only one police at present
when Dutroux was taken to the Neufchateau court for his first
hearing.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian State to Be Established in 1999: PNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
said Thursday that an independent Palestinian state will be
established in 1999, Jerusalem Media and Communication Center
(JMCC), a Palestinian press service, reported.
</P>
<P>
"Without this, the region will not see peace or stability,"
Tayeb Rahim, Secretary General to Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat, told graduating officers from a
personal security course.
</P>
<P>
Rahim added that "The Palestinian side is affirming the
establishment of a Palestinian state on all Palestinian lands with
respect to all international documents and will defeat all who
would stand in the way of our dream."
</P>
<P>
In response to the Israeli threat to enter Palestinian areas in
case of such a declaration, Rahim said that "if they enter, they
will not leave alive."
</P>
<P>
Arafat announced on several occasions that he will announce
the establishment of an independent Palestinian state in May of
1999 no matter the peace process has been moved forward or not.
</P>
<P>
He said on April 18 again that this announcement is in
accordance with the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also said several
times that Israel will annex the PNA territories if the
declaration is announced.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian negotiations have been stalled for over
a year due to Israel's construction of Jewish settlement in Har
Homa near Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
So far, no substantial progress has been achieved in this
regard despite the efforts made by parties concerned for reviving
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
As arranged by the U.S. and Britain, Arafat and Netanyahu will
travel to London in early May to hold talks there separately with
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Arafat called a meeting of PNA ministers and the Executive
Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization Thursday
evening in Gaza to discuss the peace process and the issues for
the upcoming London meetings.
</P>
<P>
He will fly to Bonn on Friday to discuss all these issues with
German leaders, asking them to help push the process back on
track.

<P>
BRUSSELS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- NATO chief Javier Solana
reassured visiting Lithuanian President Valdus Adamkus that the
western military alliance keeps its door open for other
applicants.
</P>
<P>
The NATO secretary general said that the alliance will remain
open to the accession of further members in accordance with the
NATO-founding Washington Treaty and the NATO
enlargement-initiating Madrid Declaration.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization sorted out Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic at its Madrid summit last July as
the first batch of central and eastern European countries to start
accession talks.
</P>
<P>
The three Baltic countries, all former Soviet republics, also
applied to join the 16-nation military alliance.
</P>
<P>
Solana praised Lithuania as a proven valuable partner with the
Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council and a significant participant in
the NATO Partnership for Peace program.
</P>
<P>
"Lithuania's contribution to bringing peace to the former
Yugoslavia indicates its strong European vocation and its
willingness to contribute to the security challenges that face us
in Europe today," said Solana.
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian president attended, during the visit, a North
Atlantic Council meeting held in the framework of the intensified
dialogue with partner countries.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia's Public Firms Make Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Within the 166 public
enterprises in Ethiopia, 123 have made a profit of 1.66 billion
Birr (about 240 million U.S. Dollars) in the 1996/97 financial
year.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here Thursday by head of the authority
supervising public enterprises, Assefa Abraha, when he was
presenting his report to the House of People's Representatives,
the Ethiopian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Assefa said that the profits obtained in the year were better
than that of the previous year, adding that 75 of the 166 public
enterprises met their original targets.
</P>
<P>
Compared to 1995/96 financial year, the profits the

previous year.
</P>
<P>
According to Assefa, sugar and beer factories have managed to
become profitable while textiles were among those incurred
losses.

<HEADLINE> International Community Urged to Protect Ocean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Environment
Program (UNEP) Thursday called on individuals, communities,
organizations and governments to take actions in protection of
ocean resources for future generations.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing held here Thursday, Paul Akiwumi, Program
Officer of UNEP's Water Branch, said that the United Nations
General Assembly had declared 1998 as the International Year of
the Ocean (IYO).
</P>
<P>
During the year, he said, UNEP planned to undertake various
activities to raise people's awareness on the importance of
oceans and seas to the everyday life and the necessity of
protecting this valuable source of life.
</P>
<P>
According to a background material distributed at the press
briefing, the capacity of oceans is huge in terms of heat
transfer, recycling greenhouse gases, absorbing pollutants and
sustaining marine life.
</P>
<P>
But, it noted, this capacity is limited especially in its
ability to absorb the effects of reckless development and
pollution.
</P>
<P>
There are visible signs of stress in oceans including
pollution, exhausted fishing stocks, disappearing coastlines,
rising sea level, increasing surface temperatures, more frequent
storms and melting ice caps.
</P>
<P>
For example, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO), 70 percent of fish stocks in oceans are
currently either fully exploited, overfished or in the process of
recovering from overfishing.
</P>
<P>
The International Year of the Ocean is designed to bring ocean
issues to the attention of decision-makers and the general
public, and the idea originally came from UNESCO's
Inter-governmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC).
</P>
<P>
The United Nations General Assembly formally adopted the
proposal in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to a program for IYO, the EXPO '98 will be held in
lisbon, capital of Portugal, from May 22 to September 30, with
the theme "the oceans, a heritage for the future".
</P>
<P>
During the year, ocean education is organized by IOC to
provide information on ways the oceans affect life on earth while
IOC prepares an overview of present scientific understanding of
the ocean.
</P>
<P>
The program said that a special UN series of postage stamps
will be issued in May 1998 with 20 member states of the IOC
issuing national postage stamps for the International Year of the
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
At least 30 conferences on ocean issues are planned for the
year all over the world, discussing themes including marine
pollution, coastal erosion, ocean circulation and problems of
mega-cities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than a dozen research and training cruises are
planned aboard vessels from Russia, Norway, China, India, Korea,
Indonesia, Canada, Malaysia and other countries.
</P>
<P>
The IOC has been charged with organizing the International
Year of the Ocean and UNEP is taking a leading role in the
development and implementation of the activity program.

UNITED NATIONS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Secretary of
State James Basker III said on Thursday that the United States
should pay its back dues to the United Nations to avoid being
called a deadbeat.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when introducing U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan to the audience of Rice University in Houston where
Annan delivered a speech on The Challenges of Conflict Prevention,
according to U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard.
</P>
<P>
Annan was winding up his four-day West U.S. trip to campaign
for the causes of the financially-strained U.N..
</P>
<P>
"The United States should pay its back dues," Eckhard quoted
Baker as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Individuals like nations acquire reputation and the United
States should not have the reputation of a deadbeat," Baker added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. owes the U.N. an accumulated debt of 1.6 billion U.S.
dollars in membership dues and peace-keeping contributions.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Administration wants to pay the dues, but some
lawmakers are against by putting strings to the payment which
other U.N. member states do not accept.

<HEADLINE> Peace Movement Welcomes EU's Intended Action on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Gush Shalom (Peace Movement of
Israel) Thursday welcomed the European Union's (EU) intention to
impose heavy duties on products from Jewish settlement in the West
Bank as an effort to oppose Israel's settlement policy.
</P>
<P>
"Gush Shalom regards the intended EU's move as a welcome
expression of its stated position regarding the peace process,"
the organization said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's edition of "Yediot Aharonot," Israel's leading
Hebrew newspaper, reported that the EU is preparing a list of
goods produced at Israeli settlements in the occupied territories
and presently exported to EU members, including agricultural
products, processed foods, wines, flowers and others.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, secret reports reaching the Israeli
Embassy in Brussels indicate that the Europeans are about to
impose customs duties on the products on this list.
</P>
<P>
Agreements between Israel and the EU give a partial or
complete exemption from customs duties to Israeli products of
these categories. But in international law, the occupied
territories are not part of Israel, and therefore the settlement
products would, upon publication of the list, be subjected to
heavy customs duties.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry said Thursday that the government is
making diplomatic efforts to block the EU move, which it regards
as a grave threat politically more than economically.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry also said EU's proposed move would also
violate the Oslo Accords, which give exemptions from customs
duties to products of the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
However, local experts pointed out, that line of argument of
the Israeli Foreign Ministry leads to the conclusion that, to be
eligible for customs exemptions, the settlement products must
register with the Palestinian Ministry of Trade and Industry, pay
Palestinian taxes and have their products stamped "made in
Palestine."
</P>
<P>
"It has long been clear that the Israeli settlements in the
occupied territories constitute the main obstacle on the way to
peace in our region," Gush Shalom's statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The existence of the settlements as armed enclaves which
constantly encroach on ever-more Palestinian lands, constantly
guarded by Israeli soldiers who often outnumbered the settlers
themselves, is totally incompatible with peace," it added.
</P>
<P>
"The intended move of the EU would bring this point home -- to
the settlers and the government which backs them -- and that is
the best contribution which Europe could make to the achievement
of peace," the statement concluded.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: German Parliament Gives Green Light to Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The lower house of the German
parliament Thursday gave overwhelming support for the single
European currency euro, clearing a final hurdle for Germany to
adopt the common currency along with ten other European Union
states from January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The ambitious EU project was approved by the German Bundestag
by a vote of 575 to 35 with five abstentions.
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the most important decision in the European
integration process," said German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in his
speech to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
"The euro opens great chances for new economic dynamic, for
lasting growth and secure jobs in the 21th century," he added.
</P>
<P>
Despite the broad support, the full-day parliamentary debate
also highlighted the dispute between Kohl's ruling coalition and
opposition parties about what should be done after the euro launch
and especially about social and employment policies.
</P>
<P>
While the government stressed the need for further fiscal
discipline to ensure a stable euro and called for fundamental
structural reforms to improve Germany's competitiveness,
opposition parties including Social Democrats (SPD) warned that
the euro could also create new divisions in Europe and its success
is still dependent on European-wide harmonization of taxation,
job-creation and social policies.
</P>
<P>
With Germany's next general elections just five months away,
both the SPD and the Greens also accused Kohl's government of
having blocked efforts to hold a referendum on the euro in the
country, which they said is part of reasons for the widespread
Euroscepticism among the German public.
</P>
<P>
Recent opinion polls show that between 50 to 70 percent of
Germans are still dismayed about abandoning their rock-hard German
mark in favor of the still untested euro.
</P>
<P>
Created exactly 50 years ago, the mark has been cherished by
German voters as the symbol for the country's economic miracle in
the post-war era and a safeguard against skyrocketing inflations
that robbed their savings early this century.
</P>
<P>
While expressing sympathy for the public sentiment, Kohl
stressed that due to the arduous economic convergence efforts made
by EU states as well as the so-called stability pact designed to
ensure future currency stability, he believed "the success story
of the Deutsche Mark will continue with the success of the euro".
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, German politicians on Thursday also held
back from challenging the euro membership of Italy and Belgium,
whose high public debt is seen as a major factor risking the
stability of the euro.
</P>
<P>
Public debt in both countries is currently over 120 percent of
gross domestic product, doubling the 60 percent ceiling set by the
EU Maastricht Treaty for euro members.
</P>
<P>
The final decision adopted by the Bundestag only required that
"further considerable efforts, especially with regard to debt
reduction, are still needed in order to guarantee an acceptable
fiscal fitness without additional transfers of financial
assistance within the EU".
</P>
<P>
Speaking for his Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), which
emerged as the sole parliamentary group voting against the euro on
Thursday, PDS leader Gregor Gysi stressed that social justice had
been neglected in the European drive to launch the euro which is
expected to only benefit the large companies and employers.
</P>
<P>
With the approval at the Bundestag, Germany's adoption of the
euro now only needs a final endorsement on Friday from the upper
house of parliament, the Bundesrat, which represents the country's
16 federal states.
</P>
<P>
Although the eastern German Saxony state has threatened to cast
a negative vote, this is not expected to derail the project which
only needs an approval of a simple majority at the Bundesrat.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: Military Aid to Egypt May Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of Defense William
Cohen said on Thursday the annual 1.3 billion U.S. dollars of
U.S. military assistance to Egypt will continue and could grow in
the coming years.
</P>
<P>
He said in an interview with a Cairo T.V. program that
Washington is determined to consolidate the peace process to
strengthen security and stability in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Cohen ended a two-day visit to Egypt last Monday as part of a
tour of the region.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is not interested in achieving a balance of power in
the region, "but strives at consolidating peace through forging
stronger relations" among Israel and two Arab countries of Egypt
and Jordan, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also disowned the claim of a complete U.S. support for
Israel at the expense of Arab interests, saying that the U.S. also
supports Egypt and Jordan in various fields and backs other Arab
countries as well.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. supports Egypt on a large scale, and the two
countries have joint programs in the field of active technology,
including program on frigates and F-16 aircraft," he said in the
interview.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official added that his country is helping Egypt
modernize its army through the introduction of the most
sophisticated defense systems.
</P>
<P>
Cohen told reporters in Cairo last Sunday that the
U.S.-Egyptian cooperation program in 1998 includes the
U.S. provision of 15 adventure vehicles with stinger missiles, two
frigates and torpedos, anti-ship missiles, and co-production of
tank-recovery vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Cairo has been receiving U.S. military and economic aid since
1979. But it offered recently to the Clinton administration to
reduce the annual economic aid it gets from Washington in return
for increased military aid.
</P>
<P>
Washington's allocations in 1998 for Egypt totaled 2.1 billion
dollars, including 800 million dollars in economic aid and 1.3
billion in military. The two countries have been held an annual
war game since Egypt signed a U.S.-brokered peace treaty with
Israel in 1979.

<HEADLINE> Strong Pound Is Damaging UK's Export: CBI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The strong pound is doing real
damage to Britain's exporters, said Colin Marshall, President of
the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a CBI gathering to an audience of British
manufacturers, Colin said that the strong pound is "having adverse
effects on the bottom line for many companies where foreign
currency earnings contribute to profits."
</P>
<P>
Before the end of March, the pound climbed to its strongest
level in nine years, increasing pressure on the UK exporters.
</P>
<P>
Sterling's strength has cut confidence among exporters to its
lowest for nearly seven years, according to Dun &AMP; Bradstreet, a
research institute. Only 47.5 percent of companies expected higher
exports over the next few months.
</P>
<P>
Colin also recognized that there is a productivity gap between
the UK and its French and German competitors, but made clear that
could not be tackled over night.
</P>
<P>
He said: "It has been suggested that manufacturers have been
unduly vocal about sterling and have not been paying enough
attention to maintaining the productivity drive."
</P>
<P>
Colin supported Chancellor Golden Brown's call to business to
control wage costs and further improve productivity.
</P>
<P>
However, a report by the Foundation for Manufacturing and
Industry (FMI) warns that the UK is moving down the
competitiveness league in terms of labor costs.
</P>
<P>
The minimum wage could "further increase labor compensation
costs", said Jane Croot, FMI economist.

Johan Vande Lanotte and Justice Minister Stefaan de Clerck were
sent to Belgian King Albert II.
</P>
<P>
But the king, who interrupted his vacation abroad to return to
the country after receiving the news of the escape, has not
accepted the resignation yet.
</P>
<P>
The intention to resign by the two ministers was announced by
Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene who said at the lower
house of the parliament that it was clear that such an incident
was hardly understandable and forgivable.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian police have recaptured the alleged child killer a
few hours after he ran away from a court at Neufchateau.
</P>
<P>
Dutroux was caught in southeastern Belgium, close to the
borders with Luxembourg and France, police sources said.
</P>
<P>
The alleged child killer managed to run away from one police
guard in the court and started his run in a stolen car toward the
borders of Luxembourg and France.
</P>
<P>
Belgian police had to seal off the borders while the French
police did the same on their side of the border. Police in five
countries were mobilized to join the manhunt.
</P>
<P>
Dutroux was accused of killing four of the six young girls he
had abducted in mid 1996 as a nation-wide child sex ring was
exposed and shocked the Belgian public.
</P>
<P>
The lower house of the Belgian Parliament adjoined its
afternoon session to press the cabinet for an explanation for the
runaway of the alleged child killer.
</P>
<P>
The senate also pressed for an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
There are usually two armed gendarmes on duty to guard such an
alleged criminal in court but there was only one police at present
when Dutroux was taken to the Neufchateau court for his first
hearing.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns U.N. Human Rights Resolution on Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Thursday condemned a
resolution of the United Nations Human Right Commission (UNHRC)
on Iran's human rights status, terming it as politically
motivated.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iranian official news agency IRNA, Foreign
Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said the resolution on Iran
has nothing to do with the realities in the country, adding that
the human rights were misused by certain countries for political
ends.
</P>
<P>
The UNHRC passed the resolution on Iran in Geneva on Wednesday,
blaming the Iranian government for abusing human rights.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that the UNHRC has not even been taken into
account the report of the U.N. rapporteur Maurice Danby
Copithorne on the human rights situation in Iran and the
resolution was merely passed by the western states' pressure on
the members of the commission.
</P>
<P>
He added that the resolution has adopted a spirit of
confrontation with the Islamic law and values instead of
encouraging the value-oriented cultural exchange between the
civilizations.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating that Iran is cooperating with the UNHRC, he
stressed that human rights in Iran has religious foundation and it
would make its best to honor the human rights.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Budget Deficit Drops in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese budget deficit
moderately dropped in the first three months of this year,
preliminarily reflecting the progress the country has made in
its efforts to curb the ballooning deficit.
</P>
<P>
An official report issued by the Finance Ministry Thursday said
that the state collected 1,024 billion Lebanese pounds (about 673
million U.S. dollars) of revenues and spent 1,492 billion pounds
(about 980 million dollars) in first quarter of this year,
resulting in a deficit of 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
The figures are well below the government's 42 percent deficit
target for 1998 and compare favorably with the 55 percent for
the same period of last year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But economists said that it is too early to judge the
government's fiscal performance.
</P>
<P>
The ministry stressed in the report that it would continue to
take any necessary measures to curb huge spending on the one
hand, and increase revenues on the other, in order to gradually
reduce the country's increasing deficit in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
The economy of Lebanon, which is undergoing a
multi-billion-dollar reconstruction drive to rebuild its
war-ravaged economy, deteriorated last year due to an unexpected
increased deficit of 59 percent, far over the 36 percent
budgetary forecast.

WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkmenistan and the United
States signed on Thursday an agreement on the feasibility study of
a trans-Caspian pipeline that will be granted 750,000 U.S. dollars
by the U.S. Trade and Development Agency.
</P>
<P>
The study will evaluate the construction of a new East-West
pipeline which would take gas across Turkmenistan under the
Caspian Sea, through Azerbaijan and Georgia and into Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The document was signed at a White House ceremony attended by
U.S. Vice-President Al Gore and visiting Turkmenistani President
Saparmurat Niyazov.
</P>
<P>
Niyazov, who ended his three-day official visit to the United
States, had a luncheon with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"The two presidents agreed on the importance of developing
Turkmenistan's energy resources, including a trans-Caspian transit
corridor to bring the significant oil and gas resources of that
region to market," White House spokesman Mike McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also signed several other documents for
cooperation in energy, science and technology, agriculture,
and security relations.
</P>
<P>
"Given Turkmenistan's significant position in the region, and
given its historical associations with the government of Russia,
we have a keen interest in the role that they play with respect to
regional economic security," McCurry told a briefing at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
However, McCurry denied that the joint statement on security
provides security guarantee for Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a security guarantee, this is a joint statement on
security aspects of our bilateral relationship," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also expressed the U.S. concern over Turkmenistan's
cooperation with Iran.

<HEADLINE> Asian Crisis Dampens Canadian Growth: Thiessen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Canada Governor Gordon
Thiessen said Thursday that the Asian crisis will have a dampening
influence on Canadian economy this year.
</P>
<P>
"The effects on the Canadian economy of the problems in Asia
are likely to come mainly via our other major trading partners and
through the prices of some of our exports, especially primary
commodities," Thiessen told the Senate Banking Committee
</P>
<P>
"This effects will no doubt have a dampening influence on
economic activity in Canada this year."
</P>
<P>
British Columbia will be hardest hit since the province has a
heavy reliance on the primary commodity sector and on exports to
Asia, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that the outlook for the Canadian economy is
"still positive", though Asian crisis has led to a scaling back of
earlier projections for world economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Stronger than expected economic performances in Canada's major
trading partners, particularly the United States, would help to
offset the Asian impact, he said.
</P>
<P>
And Canada has a much sounder economic foundation than in the
past thanks to low inflation, improved fiscal health and progress
made in private sector restructuring.
</P>
<P>
"This puts us in a better position to withstand shocks such as
those emanating from Asia," the governor noted.
</P>
<P>
"On balance, the Canadian economic outlook remains positive,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund projected economic growth of
3.2 percent in Canada this year. "This is generally in line with
our own projections," the governor said.

<HEADLINE> Seaweeds Flourish in Zanzibar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Seaweeds farming in the
isles of Zanzibar has flourished and brought wealth to local
people in recent years, a researcher of marine science has said.
</P>
<P>
Exports of seaweeds grew to 4871.2 tons in 1996 from 932.5
tons in 1990, making the crop the third largest foreign exchange
earner in the isles after cloves and tourism, said Nariman
Jiddawi with the Zanzibar Institute of Marine Science.
</P>
<P>
Jiddawi, who was presenting a paper Thursday on the importance
of seaweeds farming to the livelihood security of the people of
Zanzibar at an international workshop, said seaweeds farming
initially started in two villages has expanded to 34 villages in
Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
The crop was dried and exported to the United States, Denmark
and France, she told 60 participants at the second international
training workshop on the zero emissions research initiatives in
Africa, which ended here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Seaweed is usually used as food and in the pharmaceutical
industries to manufacture drugs.
</P>
<P>
There are five species of seaweeds, but the common ones in
Zanzibar are: euchuma catonii, an indigenous species, and euchuma
spinosum which was introduced in the isles from the Philippines
during the early 1990s after the local variety failed to
flourish.
</P>
<P>
Seaweeds farming in the east coast of Zanzibar has become a
major economic activity particularly to women and children who
constitute about 90 percent of the labor force, she said.
</P>
<P>
Three major companies -- Zanea, Zascol and C-Weed are engaging
in the seaweeds business, she said. They purchase the crop at
100,000 Shillings (about 150 U.S. Dollars) per ton from farmers
and export them at 250 U.S. Dollars to 800 dollars per ton.
</P>
<P>
The exporters usually provide the farmers with the seedlings
and implements such as ropes on condition that they sell the
dried crop to them.
</P>
<P>
Jiddawi explained that on average a farmer earn between 25,000
to 70,000 Shillings from selling seaweeds. She also said there
are plans to start seaweeds farming in ponds as measures to
further expand the production.
</P>
<P>
The crop has created job opportunities and improved the
nutrition and welfare of the people of Zanzibar, she said.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, which has been organized by the Tanzania
Commission for Science and Technology and sponsored bhe United
Nations Development Program (UNDP), will be followed by a
field trip to Zanzibar to see the seaweeds farms.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Hold Early Elections in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkey will hold early elections
in March, 1999 and will establish an election government this
October, state-run TRT television reported here Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Republican People's Party (CHP) Chairman
Deniz Baykal, who had a working lunch with Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz, as saying that he and Yilmaz had agreed to hold local and
parliamentary elections on the last Sunday of March, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The consensus between Baykal and Yilmaz, also leader of the
Motherland Party, ended weeks of tension and early election
debate between coalition partners and the CHP, with whose
external support the minority government is surviving.
</P>
<P>
The CHP has conditioned its support to the government on an
early election.
</P>
<P>
Baykal said he and the prime minister were in full agreement to
establish an election government headed by an independent deputy
to make sure that there wouldn't be an election economy in the
country from October to March.
</P>
<P>
A government headed by an independent deputy is a safeguard as
well against the possible use of state funds in favor of any party
during the campaign period, said the CHP leader.
</P>
<P>
Following the Yilmaz-Baykal meeting, the prime minister met
with Deputy Prime Minister and Left Democratic Party (DSP)
Chairman Bulent Ecevit to convey to him the results of his
meeting with Baykal.

</P>
<P>
He said that "if Greek Cyprus is a state, I'm (northern Cyprus)

Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south

</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus" in the north in 1983, which is only recognized by
Turkey. About 50,000 Turkish troops are stationed in northern
Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Attorney General Urges Modern-Day Slavery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno announced the establishment of a task force Thursday to fight
growing instances of modern-day slavery in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Slavery is one of history's worst moments, but it isn't just
history when you look at some of these cases," Reno told her
weekly news conference. "We are not interested in containing
modern-day slavery; we want to eradicate it in America."
</P>
<P>
Just last year, 60 deaf Mexicans were forced to peddle key
chains on the streets of Manhattan in New York City, Reno said. In
Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida, migrant farm workers were
forced to work for little pay in cramped, unsanitary living
conditions, and threatened with physical harm if they tried to
escape. In California, Thai garment workers were forced by armed
guards to work 20-hour shifts in sweatshop conditions.
</P>
<P>
In the last three years, the Justice Department has brought 10
cases involving more than 150 victims.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the cases seem to involve undocumented workers from
Mexico and other countries. But there are also cases involving
migrant workers, which do involve United States citizens," said
Acting Assistant Attorney General Bill Lann Lee, chief of
Justice's civil rights division and co-chair of the task force.
</P>
<P>
The task force will be drawn from Justice and Labor Department
investigators who already work on such cases. Under the Fair Labor
Standards Act, the solicitor of labor brings civil cases to
recover wages for underpaid workers and refers some cases to
Justice for criminal prosecution. The solicitor will be the other
task force co-chair.
</P>
<P>
"It certainly is our impression that the problem is getting
worse," said Associate Solicitor Steve Mandel. "We certainly see a
higher degree of abusive practices in the garment industry."
</P>
<P>
The task force will set up regular meetings where Labor
investigators, FBI agents and immigration officers can exchange
leads and compare techniques, Reno said. It also will establish a
central database and draft "a blueprint for addressing the unique
needs of victims of worker exploitation" so they "will be more
willing to come forward and report these terrible crimes."
</P>
<P>
That would include medical care and protection for abused
workers, Reno said.
</P>
<P>
Mandel said the garment industry in particular is very
difficult to monitor in part because the exploited workers "tend
to be undocumented, and they are often unwilling to come to us
with complaints."
</P>
<P>
Lee said the task force would look into whether legislation is
needed to allow victims who are illegal aliens to avoid
deportation if they come forward to report abuses. But for now,
decisions on whether to deport illegal aliens discovered in
slavery will continue to be made on a case-by-case basis, Reno and
Lee said.

<HEADLINE> Opponents of NATO Expansion Claim They're Gaining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Senators opposed to expanding
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) claimed they are
gaining more support but admitted that they are on a uphill and
would not be able to stop the move.
</P>
<P>
As the Senate is to debate on the measure to add Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic to the military alliance, both
sides were generally predicting Senate approval, which seems
likely to take place sometime next week.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, one of nine
senators who denounced the legislation at the press conference,
said it was hard to persuade people expansion was bad because
"everybody likes NATO" and feels expanding it "must be positive."
</P>
<P>
They argue that the expansion will cost U.S. taxpayers untold
billions, needlessly alienate Moscow, force the United States into
dangerous military alliances and blur NATO's mandate.
</P>
<P>
Republican Senator John Warner of Virginia asked, "What will it
do? What's its mission?". He added that the expansion could turn
NATO into "a mini-U.N."
</P>
<P>
A two-thirds majority vote is needed for ratifying the
alliance's plan.
</P>
<P>
The 16-member NATO extended invitations to Poland, Hungary and
the Czech Republic last July and completed accession negotiations
in December last year.
</P>
<P>
Key arguments against NATO expansion include the concern that
it will exacerbate tensions with Russia, result in substantial
costs and risks that the allies are unwilling to share and the
American people are unwilling to shoulder alone, and dilute the
mission, policy-making and military effectiveness of the alliance.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Bans Gun Exports to Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. companies are temporarily
barred from exporting firearms to Britain, the State Department
announced Thursday in an action taken in consultation with the
British government.
</P>
<P>
"The decision to revoke outstanding munitions licenses for
firearms destined to the UK was taken in consultation with the UK
after discussions with them," State Department spokesman James
Rubin told a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
He said there was no evidence that U.S. firearms exported to
Europe actually have found their way into the wrong hands, such as
Iran or Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"It's a concern," he said. "It's not something we believe has
already happened."
</P>
<P>
The temporary ban on firearms exports to Britain resulted from
continuous monitoring of the British laws and regulations "to
ensure that retransfer and important controls are sufficiently
strong," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
He said the problem was with new British laws governing
handguns, not with any actions by British importers.
</P>
<P>
"Wherever possible, actions are taken both by countries to
align import and export actions, and this can take the form of
license revocations. This is what happened in the case of the UK,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
There is, however, no plan to halt firearm sales to other
European Union countries, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
The ban will last until licenses can be reissued to reflect new
British laws governing the re-export of guns to other countries,
he said.

<P>
BONN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Germany's electronics giant Siemens
announced Thursday that it is planning to hand over the production
of its personal computers to Taiwan's Acer group amid a broad
shake-up of its entire telecommunications and computer operations.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan announced by Siemens in Munich, Acer will take
over Siemens Nixdorf's PC production operations in the southern
German city of Augsburg, although the Siemens subsidiary will
continue to distribute PCs manufactured there under its own name.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Siemens will also regroup its current units
of public communications network, private telecommunication
system, as well as most of the remaining Siemens Nixdorf business
into three new structures for services, networks, and products
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring, the biggest one in recent years, will take
effect up from October 1, Siemens said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ambassador Presses Congress to Pay U.N. Dues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States could save
100 million U.S. dollars a year in U.N. dues if Congress approves
payment of a major part of the arrears owed to the organization,
U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a House appropriate subcommittee, he also warned
the United States could lose its vote in the United Nations by the
end of the year unless the debt issue is resolved.
</P>
<P>
He said the Clinton administration remains open to any
compromise that would separate U.N. funding from U.S. payments to
family-planning organizations.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said passage of the request for payment of most of
the 1.3 billion U.S. dollars it owes the organization by the end
of May would open the way for talks this summer on reducing the
annual U.S. contribution from 25 percent of the U.N. budget to 22
percent.
</P>
<P>
"Failure to pass the necessary legislation in time will cause
us to squander this unique opportunity and we will be unable to
reopen the scales of assessment (talks ) until the fall of 2000,"
Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
The Senate approved a plan to pay more than 800 million U.S.
dollars in U.N. arrears, but it was derailed in the House of
Representatives when Clinton refused to accept amendments to
outlaw funds for abortion.
</P>
<P>
The full committee has approved 505 million U.S. dollars for
payment of U.S. arrears but Richardson said the administration
needed the 921 million U.S. dollars in its initial request.
</P>
<P>
"Our closest friends in the U.N. are warning us that we face a
decidedly uphill battle even with the full amount the
administration is requesting" to get the U.S assessment reduced,
Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
Congress has held up payments of U.N. debts for years to demand
reduction in U.S. payments and streamlining in the world
organization.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said that U.N. reform has become unrelenting under
the leadership of Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has cut
administrative costs by one-third, merged three departments into
one and eliminated nearly 1,000 positions.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Western Cape Leader Elected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The future premier of South
Africa's Western Cape Province was elected Thursday night,
marking the first time that a colored person takes the top post
of the province.
</P>
<P>
The province's Safety MEC (Member of Executive Council) Gerald
Morkel was elected to succeed Hernus Kriel as Western Cape National
Party (NP) leader, and hence automatically the premier of the
province, where the NP holds the majority in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Morkel, 57, would be sworn in on May 11 and he will hold the post
until next year's general election.
</P>
<P>
Morkel, the most senior provincial minister, as well as leader of
the provincial legislature and deputy premier, is expected to lead the
NP in the crucial battle of the coming election in Western Cape to
secure the last NP stronghold constituency.
</P>
<P>
The NP's Western Cape head council chose Morkel Thursday night in
preference to Health MEC Peter Marais, 54.
</P>
<P>
Morkel is widely seen as a suave, diplomatic personality, a man
more capable of uniting the party than Marais, who is often described
as "firebrand" and "unguided missile".
</P>
<P>
However, some doubted that Morkel, who is seen as lacking political
shrewdness.
</P>
<P>
The timing of Kriel's resignation, announced Monday, was
interpreted as making way for a colored new NP leader, a move to
secure colored votes for the NP which are critical in the coming
election.
</P>
<P>
Morkel, a stalwart of the former Labor Party in the erstwhile house
of representatives, joined the NP in 1991.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sees no Sufficient Grounds to Lift Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Thursday
dismissed any possibilities of lifting the seven-year sanctions as
Iraq has repeatedly demanded.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the Clinton
administration has "seen insufficient grounds" to lift the
sanctions and said Iraq must comply "with a whole host" of
requirements before the embargo is removed.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz on Thursday sent a
letter to the president of the Security Council, claiming that
Iraq had fulfilled all the disarmament requirements of a key 1991
council resolution, and demanding to end the sanctions against his
country.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq demands that the Security Council implement paragraph 22
of resolution 687 immediately without any new restrictions or
conditions," Aziz said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
The paragraph in the resolution provides the easing of
sanctions, once all Iraq's nuclear, chemical, biological and
ballistic weapons have been scrapped and steps taken to ensure
they cannot be rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
Aziz also accused U.N. chief weapons inspector Richard Butler
of spreading "fallacies and lies."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a report Butler submitted to the Security
Council last Friday, which said that there had been "virtually no
progress" made in verifying whether Iraq has destroyed banned
weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council will discuss the reports next week. And
State Department spokesman James Rubin expected no one in the
Security Council would advocate the lifting of the sanctions
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine, based on the report that Chairman Butler
ahs provided, that any country in the Security Council would be
advocating a suspension of any part of the sanctions regime," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Cabinet Slams UNSCOM Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi cabinet Thursday described
an UNSCOM's (U.N. Special Commission) report as an attempt to
block Iraq's effort for lifting the U.N.-imposed sanctions on it,
the Iraqi News Agency INA reported.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet meeting chaired by President Saddam Hussein
discussed UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler's semi-annual report to
the U.N. Security Council, which said that there are still
obstacles standing in the way of arms inspection and that Iraq has
not fully cooperated with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait
in 1990 can not be lifted unless the UNSCOM in charge of
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction verifies that Iraq
is free of banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet said that Iraq's cooperation with the
U.N. inspectors is meant to offer an opportunity for the world
community to make a concerted effort to lift the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
But "Such attempts (like Butler's report) by the United States
were intended to perpetuate the sanctions to secure a streamline
implementation of its conspiratorial agenda against the world,
Arab nation and the Middle East," the INA quoted cabinet members
as saying.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, N. Cyprus to Further Strengthen Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and northern Cyprus
declared here on Thursday that they would further enhance
cooperation between them.
</P>
<P>
This came in a joint declaration issued at the end of the
official talks between Turkish President Suleyman Demirel and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash who arrived in Istanbul
Wednesday for a two-day official visit to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The declaration said that northern Cyprus would continue to
exist as an independent and sovereign state, adding that the
relations between Turkey and northern Cyprus in all fields would
be further deepened and strengthened.
</P>
<P>
It strongly criticized the European Union's (EU) decision to
start accession talks with Cyprus, terming the EU Luxembourg
summit, at which the decision was made, as an "historic mistake."
</P>
<P>
It said that "the military, economic and political integration
which Greece and Greek Cyprus are virtually accomplishing
obstructs the efforts for a solution on the island."
</P>
<P>
The declaration noted that any further talks between the two
sides in Cyprus could be held only on the basis of two
sovereign and equal states, adding that northern Cyprus is ready
to take part in any negotiations within this framework.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops landed and took over the northern third of the island in
the wake of an abortive coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus" in the north in 1983, which is only recognized
by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Albright Pursues Two Goals in China Trip: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright will pursue two goals in her trip to China next
week: summit preparation and continuation of strategic dialogue, a
senior State Department official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Summit preparation is a key point in going," said the
official, who indicated the U.S. willingness to follow up the
issues identified for joint efforts when Chinese President Jiang
Zemin came to visit the U.S. last fall.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang and his U.S. counterpart, Bill Clinton, agreed
at their Washington summit in late October that the two countries
should establish a constructive strategic partnership for the 21st
century. President Clinton is scheduled to return a visit to China
by the end of June to have another summit meeting with Jiang in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"There are certain priorities. But first, across the board,
what we want to do is move along what was agreed to the last time
when President Jiang Zemin came to the U.S. and there it was
agreed that we would work on what was identified as nine `baskets'
of issues and try to achieve progress in all of them," said the
official.
</P>
<P>
The so-called "baskets" of issues mainly include human rights,
non-proliferation, trade and commerce, energy and environment. The
official said that priority will be given to the human rights
issue, non-proliferation and trade.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Albright will arrive in Beijing Wednesday
following her visit to Japan. China is the second leg of her
four-nation trip which will also take her to South Korea and
Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
The official said that this is the first of four trips planned
by the secretary of state to Asia this year, showing importance
the U.S. attaches to the region.
</P>
<P>
The secretary of state will continue "strategic dialogue" with
Chinese officials, the second goal of her trip as described by the
official.
</P>
<P>
"We sit down with China the way we do with other important
relationships and we talk about the world; not just about the
focus on the immediate bilateral problems," the official said.
</P>
<P>
"The idea is that two major powers should be talking to each
other about a whole range of foreign policy issues, and not just
having a relationship that focuses on the discrete problems," the
official added.
</P>
<P>
It is said that Albright will meet with Vice Premier Qian
Qichen, Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan and some other Chinese
officials during her stay in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The official believed that the Sino-U.S. relationship is "on a
good trajectory," with progress being made on a large number of
areas including human rights and non-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
However, the official said that there is a lot of work left
ahead of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
China's access to the World Trade Organization and the Taiwan
issue are among the problems which need more efforts to settle.

WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The interrelated issues of
crime, children's well-being and drug abuse lead a list of
national concerns revealed Thursday in the Healthy Kids Public
Opinion Survey by the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA).
</P>
<P>
White House scandals rank low on a survey of the nation's
concerns, rated most important by only 2 percent of respondents.
</P>
<P>
Three-quarters of respondents said child care today has become
"a greater problem" for Americans than it was 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
As to what attributes are important to good child care, 98
percent agreed that selecting a safe and caring environment is
"very" or "somewhat" important, while 98 percent said the same
about programs that educate and develop social skills.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar Thursday rose
against major European currencies for the second consecutive day
as traders sold the German mark and the Swiss franc to gain the
Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
The dollar slipped against the Japanese yen in lackluster
trading partly because investors are waiting for details of an
economic stimulus package the Japanese government will unveil
Friday.
 at 1.7983
marks, up from 1.7940 late Wednesday. It also was changing hands
at 130.18 yen, down from 130.28.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, investors decided to take profits, selling the
mark and the Swiss franc against the yen. That helped make the yen
stronger in its trades with the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The pound didn't fully rebound from its fall against the
dollar.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Keep Edge over Democrats in Fund Raising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The committees helping elect
Senate and House Republicans keep a fund-raising edge over their
Democratic counterparts, although both political parties are
raising more money than they did during the last off-year
elections four years ago.
</P>
<P>
The National Republican Senatorial Committee reported raising
3.8 million dollars in March, including 1.2 million dollars in
"soft money," -- unregulated money which is supposed to be used
for party-building activities and issue-oriented advertising. That
same month, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee raised
2.2 million dollars, including 770,854 dollars in "soft money."
</P>
<P>
Between January 1, 1997, and March 31, 1998, the NRSC took in
45 million dollars, as compared to 41 million dollars during the
same 15-month period four years ago. Contributions to the DSCC
also went up, from 14 million dollars during the 15-month period
beginning Jan. 1, 1993, to 23 million dollars during the
equivalent period beginning January 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee raised 1.6
million dollars in March, including 463,531 dollars in "soft
money." That brought the committee's 15-month total to 19 million
dollars, compared with 12 million dollars in 1993-94.
</P>
<P>
The National Republican Congressional Committee, which files on
a different schedule, earlier reported raising 43 million dollars
in the 15-month period that began January 1, 1997, almost three
times the 15 million dollars the committee collected during the
same period in 1993-94, the last time members of Congress ran in a
non-presidential election year.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Greek Officials Discuss Cyprus Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. State Department's
special coordinator for Cyprus, Thomas Miller, discussed Thursday
with Greek Foreign Undersecretary Yiannos Kranidiotis ways of
settling the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a statement after Thursday night's talks, Miller,
who arrived here later Thursday, said that the American initiative
for a resolution of the Cyprus problem was under the aegis of the
United Nations and aimed at the attainment of a bizonal,
bicommunal, federal scheme.
</P>
<P>
He said that U.S. President's special emissary for Cyprus
Richard Holbrooke, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
himself believed that the current period was the most appropriate
for an intensive effort to resolve the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Miller regarded the resumption of negotiations between Cypriot
president Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash as "a matter of substance."
</P>
<P>
He said that Holbrooke and himself would visit Cyprus on May 1
to have discussions with the parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Kranidiotis voiced Greece's support for the U.S.
initiative, saying that the initiative should be in the framework
of U.N. efforts and the Security Council resolutions about Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the quest for a bizonal, bicommunal federation
should enjoy the "broadest possible support."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops occupied
the northern third of the island in the wake of an abortive coup
backed by Athens.

<HEADLINE> Complete Ban on All Tests for Nuclear Weapons Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Laboratory-based nuclear
weapons testing undermines Non-Proliferation Treaty commitments
and they should be banned totally, urged energy and environmental
research experts on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After the Cold War, treaties have been signed for arms
reduction and dismantlement, but some nuclear weapons states have
repeatedly indicated that they have no intention of pursuing total
nuclear disarmament, Arjun Makhijani, President of the Institute
for Energy and Environmental Research, said at a press briefing at
the National Press Club in Washing, D.C.
</P>
<P>
"The United States and Russia still have huge arsenals on
hair-trigger alert at a time when command and control systems in
Russia may be deteriorating," Makhijani said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, nuclear weapons states are continuing to develop
nuclear weapons, he said. Under its stockpile Stewardship and
Management program, the United States intends to retain huge teams
of designers and give them research tools that will maintain a
high level of "exciting" and challenging scientific projects
related to nuclear weapons design.
</P>
<P>
He said that the military laboratory programs by the United
States, France and Russia put the Comprehensive Test Ban treaty
(CTBT) in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out that laboratory fusion programs could
result in new types of nuclear weapons being created. Besides new
designs of thermonuclear weapons, these programs raise the
possibility of new types of nuclear weapons that do not use
plutonium or highly enriched uranium.
</P>
<P>
These weapons may take the form of pure fusion weapons, that
is, nuclear weapons that only have a thermonuclear component.
Weapons that have a thermonuclear component that triggers a
fission component made of widely available uranium-238 may also be
developed. Such developments may occur both as a result of
military programs and of programs that are now stated to be for
non-military applications only, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the CTBT does not make any exception for nuclear fusion
explosions, or for peaceful research. It not only prohibits
nuclear explosion, but also requires parties to prevent them from
occurring under their jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
However, several laboratory fusion programs in both nuclear
weapons states as well as in non-nuclear weapons states have the
potential of violating the CTBT, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Makhijani said, given the immense consequences of the
development of pure fusion weapons, an indefinite delay of planned
Magnetized Target Fusion (MTF) experiments and a hold on the
construction fo large facilities designed to achieve ignition is
necessary.
</P>
<P>
"In the event that the projects are not halted, the United
States, France, Germany and Japan should announce now the
restraints they will appear to be a minimal commitment that these
countries ought to be willing to make," said Makhijani.

MEXICO CITY, April 23 (Xinhua) -- At least 235 Mexicans died
attempting to enter the United States illegally from January 1994
to April 15, 1998, a report by six Mexican non-governmental
organizations said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The human rights organizations claimed the Mexicans, including
children and women, died of drowning, sunstroke, hypothermia and
accidents trying to cross the border between the northern Mexican
state of Baja California and the U.S. state of California.
</P>
<P>
Under new U.S. immigration laws, illegal immigrants with forged
documents face a prison sentence, so undocumented people have
opted to cross the border at less controlled points which are more
dangerous.

HARBIN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A 15-month-old female baby born
with two mouths, was operated on in a hospital in northeast China's

"Food that she ate in her normal mouth often came out of the
second mouth," the girl's father explained. He and her grandfather

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Successful in Curbing Imports of Harmful Wastes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, the largest trade
center in China, has made progress in curbing illegal imports of
harmful material from foreign countries in the past year.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, a total of 840,000 tons of re-usable wastes came
throug the Shanghai port, and the local Customs office did not
report findings of any illegal and harmful objects among them.
</P>
<P>
However, between July of 1995 and May of 1996, the Shanghai
Customs office uncovered cases involving imports of harmful
wastes, mainly from Europe and North America, such as waste
plastic bags, used rubber gloves, soft drink bottles and used film.
</P>
<P>
The latest finding shows that the local authorities have put a
halt to illicit imports, said local Customs officers.
</P>
<P>
This came as a result of the joint efforts from the local
Customs, commodity inspection as well as environmental
departments.
</P>
<P>
Chinese law stipulates that import of harmful wastes is an
illegal act, and the country has issued regulations specifying
that imports of wastes must be approved by the state environmental
bureau, go through inspections and examinations by local
functionaries before being let in.

<HEADLINE> WFP Seeks Massive Emergency Food Aid for Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. World Food Program (WFP)
appealed Thursday for 88 million U.S. dollars to begin emergency
food relief in Indonesia in order to avert a severe crisis this
year.
</P>
<P>
Due to a serious drought caused by the worst EL Nino weather in
50 years, many parts of Indonesia are suffering from a low crop
yield. At the same time, the country has been caught in a
regional economic crisis that has affected its ability to import
rice, its staple food.
</P>
<P>
In the appeal, the WFP seeks to provide 225,000 metric tons of
rice and blended foods for approximately 4.6 million of the most
vulnerable Indonesians, including pregnant women and nursing
mothers, children under five and families who only have enough
food for one meal a day.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. agency will also direct a number of community
food-for-work activities, including fire hazard awareness and
prevention programs.
</P>
<P>
The emergency operation, which will complement national
efforts, will help the country survive the coming dry season
beginning in May and lasting until next spring's expected harvest.
</P>
<P>
The WFP's appeal asks donor countries for assistance in the
form of loans grants, concession imports and targeted food aid.
</P>
<P>
"We ask the international community to act now to prevent the
present food shortage from developing into a major food crisis,"
WFP Executive Director Catherine Bertini said. "The people of
Indonesia need our help to recover from these recent calamities."
</P>
<P>
According to the findings of a joint mission to the country
conducted by WFP and the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) in March, 7.5 million people in 15 provinces will likely
experience acute household food problems over the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
The mission also found that Indonesia's rice import
requirements would be about 3.5 million tons during the current
marketing year, which ends 31 March 1999.
</P>
<P>
The FAO/WFP report released after the mission stated that more
and more Indonesians are living below the poverty line due to the
country's reduced ability to import goods, steep increases in food
prices and a rapidly growing unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
The program is the first external food assistance Indonesia has
required since 1996. Improving socio-economic trends and the
government's ability to meet import requirements with its own
resources meant it has not been required, the report said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Italy, Slovenia, Hungary to Build Road Leading to Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Italy, Slovenia and Hungary agreed
Thursday to establish a joint authority to oversee the
construction of a road-rail link between the northeastern Italian
city of Trieste with the Ukrainian capital Kiev.
</P>
<P>
Italian Premier Romano Prodi, Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula
Horn and their Slovenian counterpart Janez Drnovsek signed the
agreement at their summit meeting here.
</P>
<P>
The joint authority, which will be based in Trieste, will plan,
finance and execute the project.
</P>
<P>
The proposed road-rail link, to pass through the Slovenian
capital Ljubljana and the Hungarian capital Budapest, is part of
the "Corridor 5" project to create a major transport artery linking
western and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
These three countries formed the Trilateral Pact in October
1996 within the framework of the Central European Initiative. It
aims to promote wide-ranging cooperation between them and
ultimately to promote stability in central and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Trilateral Pact hopes that Corridor 5 will eventually run
all the way from Barcelona, Spain, to Kiev. Corridor 5 is supposed
to compete with another planned cross-Europe route connecting
Paris, Berlin and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
In fact, work has begun on parts of the Trieste-Kiev route, but
progress has slowed down due to financial problems.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government vowed to fund its part of the
initiative, said Trieste Mayor Riccardo Illy. Italy hopes the
stretch between Trieste and Budapest will be completed early in
the next century.

<HEADLINE> Annan says U.S. Debts Hurt UN Peace-keeping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Kofi Annan, Secretary-General
of the United Nations, said on Thursday the United States was
hurting the U.N.'s peacekeeping efforts by refusing to pay its
arrears.
</P>
<P>
The United States' indebtedness to the United Nations, which
now totals 1.5 billion U.S. dollars, is also poisoning
international relations, Annan said in a speech to about 4,000
people at Rice University in Houston.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who is on the final day of a three-day trip to
California and Texas, said: "By withholding the payments the U.S.
is provoking friends and foe alike."
</P>
<P>
According to news reports reaching here, Annan said the U.N.
had been unable to repay nations such as Fiji and Bangladesh for
providing soldiers for peacekeeping operations in the western
Sahara, which in turn made it difficult to get them for other
operations.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. behavior is destroying trust among nations and this is a
very serious charge," Annan said. "It does impede our ability to
function."
</P>
<P>
While in Houston, Annan met with former U.S. Secretary of State
James Baker and former President George Bush. They have both
supported U.S. involvement in the United Nations and Baker, in
particular, has called for payment of the U.S. debt.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson warned that
the United States could lose its vote in the United Nations by the
end of the year unless the debt issue is resolved.
</P>
<P>
Testifying before the House Appropriation Subcommittee, he said
the Clinton administration remains open to any compromise that
would separate U.N. funding from U.S. payments to family-planning
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said passage of the request for payment of most of
the 1.3 billion U.S. dollars it owes the organization by the end
of May would open the way for talks this summer on reducing the
annual U.S. contribution from 25 percent of the U.N. budget to 22
percent.
</P>
<P>
"Failure to pass the necessary legislation in time will cause
us to squander this unique opportunity and we will be unable to
reopen the scales of assessment (talks) until the fall of 2000,"
he noted.

<HEADLINE> Investors Say Infrastructure Improves in Hainan (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Tonio Takazaki, general manager of
the Hainan Toyo Huisan Kaisha Ltd., a Japanese aquatic products
venture on China's Hainan province, says that he is impressed with
the improvement of the island's infrastructure over the past ten
years.
</P>
<P>
His company's initial investment was three million US dollars,
on an aquatic products farm which covers 53.3 hectares of
land. Later on he put another 10 million US dollars into the
venture, and now the company made 10 million US dollars worth of
exports a year. And, it was selected as a successul model for all
overseas-funded enterprises in the country.
</P>
<P>
But, ten years ago, when Hainan was just designated as a
province, overseas investors like Takazaki were very disappointed
and annoyed by the inconveniences caused by power shortages, and
terrible telephone and traffic conditions.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government was determined to change the
situation and has since worked out policies, giving top priority to
improvement of infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> China's Economy Grows 7.2 Percent in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- China's economic growth in the
first quarter this year slowed down to 7.2 percent on a
year-on-year basis, the State Statistics Bureau (SSB) said here
this morning.
</P>
<P>
The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) totaled 1,589.9 billion yuan
in the three months, SSB spokesman Qiu Xiaohua told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Inflation was almost zero during the period, with the consumer
price index (CPI) rising just 0.3 percent over the corresponding
period of last year and the retail price index (RPI) falling by
1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese economy grew 8.8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
"The overall situation of the Chinese economy is basically
normal," said Qiu, while pointing out that a most prominent
problem confronting the economy still lies with the sliding
economic efficiency of the country's industries.
</P>
<P>
"But we can count on a full realization of the annual economic
growth of eight percent this year, with the deepening of the
reform drive and a successful expansion of the domestic demand,"
stressed the SSB spokesman.
</P>
<P>
A breakdown showed that agriculture, industry, and service
sector grew four percent, 7.8 percent, and seven percent over the
same period last year, respectively.
</P>
<P>
China used a total of 8.596 billion US dollars of overseas
direct investment during the first three months of this year, up
9.7 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last month, the state foreign exchange reserve
had reached 140.6 billion US dollars, 700 million US dollars more
than at the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China registered a trade surplus of 10.64 billion
US dollars, with exports up by 13.2 percent to 40.24 billion
US dollars and imports up by 2.7 percent to 29.6 billion
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"From a long-term point of view, China's economy has a solid
material basis and adequate support from the national policies,"
Qiu said.
</P>
<P>
"To ensure China's economy to grow eight percent this year,
the whole nation needs to fully implement the related policies,
especially those designed to stimulate domestic demand growth,
optimize the economic structure and increase efficiency, "
the SSB spokesman said.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the past decade, the province has spent 118 billion yuan
(14.2 billion US dollars) on fixed assets, which have grown 31
percent annually.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, its electricity generating capacity was
1.56 million kilowatts, and it supplied 3.4 billion kilowatts
annually, five times the amount in 1987, something that has
allowed many new industrial cities to be built.
</P>
<P>
There were only 3 berths for 10,000-dwt ships in Hainan in
1987, but now there are 12, providing links with 20 countries and
regions and a port handling capacity of 10 million tons at the end
of last year.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, the island has built 5,000 kilometers of
highways, bringing the total to 17,000 kilometers, and putting it
in the first place in terms of highway density in China.
</P>
<P>
The province also has a new airport in Sanya in the southern
part of the island, a larger airport in the capital, at least 130
air routes and 450 flights each week, linking it with many major
world cities.
</P>
<P>
The province now has over 10,000 long-distance telephone lines
linking it with over 2,000 cities and towns in China and over 230
cities in the other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
This has brought in 8,000 enterprises with 7.5 billion US
dollars worth of overseas funding and over 19,000 enterprises with
50 billion yuan in investment from other Chinese regions to the
island province.

<HEADLINE> Zedillo Denies Market Economy Causes Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo denied Thursday that the market economy has caused poverty
to millions of Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
He said that poverty is a result of many years of statist,
populist, and paternalist policies which oppose market economy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 24th National Assembly of the Mexican
Foundation for Rural Development, Zedillo said he is determined to
stabilize the market economy with a growing investment in human
resources.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would allot resources for the Alliance
for Agriculture worth 2.632 billion pesos (about 317 million U.S.
dollars), 50 percent more than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The president hoped that the growing social spending would
provide the poor opportunities of progress and well-being and also
promote equality and justice.
</P>
<P>
The worst problem for the Mexican agriculture is that the poor
cannot produce enough to help themselves out of poverty. Zedillo
said it is a permanent and complex vicious circle that bars them
from being well-off.
</P>
<P>
"Mexicans must build an economy with a human face in which the
economic growth will not be an end, but only the necessary means
to advance in social justice," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Economic Growth Picks up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese economic growth
starts to pick up in March, said Qiu Xiaohua, spokesman for the
State Statistics Bureau (SSB) at a press conference this morning.
</P>
<P>
"The pick-up trend is indicated in a growing money supply,
intensifying bank lendings, and increasing industrial growth
beginning from March," Qiu said.
</P>
<P>
He said the central bank has intensified the money supply from
March, with the money supply in the broad and narrow sense
increasing 15.4 percent and 11.8 percent on a yearly basis,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has set the annual goal of broad money supply
growth at 16 to 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
The total loans made by Chinese banks also rose 15.4 percent on
an annual basis during the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The SSB spokesman added the nation's industrial growth also
gained speed in March.
</P>
<P>
The growth of the total industrial output value stayed at eight
percent during the first two months and rose to nine percent in
March, which brought the average growth rate up to 8.2 percent,
according to the SSB spokesman.

<P>
SAN JOSE, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican Labor Minister Farid
Ayales resigned his post Thursday after being charged with the
illegal administration of money collected from Nicaraguan
immigrant workers.
</P>
<P>
Ayales said he had already tendered his resignation to
President Jose Maria Figueres and he denied the charges in a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Ministry created a work card to legalize the presence
of hundreds of thousands of undocumented Nicaraguan workers in
Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
The measure had the support of the Nicaraguan authorities.
However, the Costa Rican Public Attorney's Office conducted an
investigation into abuses reported in the case.
</P>
<P>
The minister reportedly created an agency in charge of
collecting 5,000 colons (almost 20 dollars) to process the
document, but the practice was challenged by several sectors.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica had promised to provide 50,000 working cards to
Nicaraguans when they fulfilled certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
Almost half of the Nicaraguan workers in Costa Rica have
received working cards, said informed sources.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 23 (Xinhua) -- In a referendum held on
Thursday, nearly five million voters in Serbia, Yugoslavia, gave
an overwhelming "no" to international mediation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results for the referendum showed that about 93
percent of the voters opposed foreign interference in Yugoslavia's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The voters expressed support in the principled stand of
Yugoslavian and Serbian leaders that Kosovo is an inseparable part
of Serbia and the issue is an internal affair and should be
settled by political means, the Politika daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a polling booth in Belgrade, Yugoslavian President
Slobodan Milosevic said all nationalities in the country could and
must solve their problems by themselves for common interests.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic urged leaders of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo to open
talks with Serbian representatives as soon as possible, and hoped
that the Serbian authorities be fully sincere in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanian leaders in Kosovo have repeatedly refused to
meet with the Serbian government delegation unless foreign
representatives are present.
</P>
<P>
At least 80 ethnic Albanians and Serb policemen have been
killed since ethnic conflicts broke out in the Serbian province in
late February.

<HEADLINE> No Problem for China's Economy to Grow 8 Percent: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- China will face no big
difficulties in achieving an eight percent economic growth this
year, a spokesman for the State Statistics Bureau (SSB) said here
this morning.
</P>
<P>
The national economy increased steadily in the first quarter,
and it will further pick up in the remaining quarters of this
year, spokesman Qiu Xiaohua said at a press conference in
responding to a question by a reporter.
</P>
<P>
The existing material conditions are the most favorable for
economic expansion since China started to implement the policy of
reform and opening-up.
</P>
<P>
The bottleneck posed by energy, communications, and raw
materials sectors has been obviously alleviated, he added.
</P>
<P>
Good agricultural harvests for three consecutive years also
provided conditions for this, he said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange reserve has topped 140 billion US dollars, and
bank deposits exceeded the loans in the past four years, offering
another advantage to this, he added.
</P>
<P>
Qiu said that the inflation problem has been obviously solved,
with prices continuing to go down.
</P>
<P>
And the central government has made a series of clear and
appropriate policies for control of macro-economy. Now efforts are
being intensified to readjust economic structure, deepen reform,
and stimulate domestic demand, he said.
</P>
<P>
"All these constitute a favorable macro-economic environment
for achieving the goal of an eight percent growth of the national
economy this year," Qiu said, adding that immediate efforts should
be made to achieve higher economic performance.

The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- The tense legal battle for the waterfront will go to the
high court this morning after a crucial legal victory for
waterside workers Thursday diminished the Howard government's
hopes of going to the next federal election armed with a quick and
crushing victory on dock reform.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>

Australians could insure against nursing home charges, home care
costs and "five star" facilities.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- Jubilant wharfies Thursday night vowed to return to work at
midday Friday after a full bench of the federal court delivered a
stunning blow to the Howard government's waterfront agenda and
upheld orders for the dock workers' reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- The federal budget next month will dash any hopes still held
by Australian business for a revived soft loans scheme to help

<P>
The quake's epicenter was located 50 km east of Manokwari,
about 12 km beneath the earth's surface.
</P>
<P>
The shock, which did not last long and measured six on the
Richter Scale, caused panic among the local population and
reminded them of the strong quake which devastated Biak Numfor,
Serui and Manokwari regencies some three years ago.
</P>
<P>
The tremor which hit Manokwari in 1995 caused large-scale
damage in Robi, Angrem, Borarsi, Borobudur, Fanindi, Wirsi and
Airkuki, said the agency.

<HEADLINE> China in Solid Position to Enhance Economy: World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- China is in a solid position to
stimulate its economy and absorb an external shock, a senior World
Bank (WB) official said here today.
</P>
<P>
While economic growth weakened in the first quarter this year,
an acceleration is expected to occur gradually some time later in
light of investment increase, Kathie Krumm, Chief for Economics of
the WB Resident Mission in China, said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
China's State Statistics Bureau (SSB) told a press conference here
this morning that economic growth slowed down to 7.2 percent in
the first three months this year, compared to an average of 8.8
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
"Recent macroeconomic trend has added to concerns at the end
of 1997 that growth is significantly weakening, in particular,
that domestic demand is weak," Kathie Krumm said.
</P>
<P>
The situation has been compounded by a deceleration in growth
in net external demand stemming from the Asia regional crisis --
albeit less than expected so far, she said.
</P>
<P>
However, the chief economist held that the reforms of the last
couple of years, in particular, macroeconomic stabilization and
foreign exchange management, have provided favorable conditions
for China's efforts to promote economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Chinese government has recently taken measures
to expand investment, she said that "modest domestic demand
stimulus including increased investment is appropriate to help
boost the economy."
</P>
<P>
"This is essential to employment expansion for facilitating
state-owned enterprise restructuring and continued labor
mobility," she said.
</P>
<P>
"While China's economy is like a huge ship whose direction
cannot be changed within a one-quarter adjustment, the
acceleration will appear in coming quarters gradually, if
investment expands," she said.
</P>
<P>
She suggested that the Chinese government use levers to boost
the economy that are consistent with the structural reform agenda,
including reliance on the financial sector to identify efficient
projects and tapping of domestic savings through alternative
channels.
</P>
<P>
"We support the government's intentions to stimulate the
economy in a timely manner and its commitment to continue to
promote the structural agenda during this process," the WB
economist said.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Opposition Wants to Settle Crisis Through </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of the
Anti-Taliban Northern Alliance, who arrived here Thursday evening
for the proposed face-to-face meeting with the Taliban scheduled
for Saturday, said they wanted to settle disputed issues with the
militia through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen at the Islamabad airport, the coordinator of
the nine-member delegation of the Northern Alliance, Abdul Rahim,
said they would be participating in the meeting of the Steering
Committee with sincerity.
</P>
<P>
Rahim said the proposed talks would focus on the setting up of
a Ulema (religious scholars) Commission, as well as dealing with
the issues of ceasefire, exchange of prisoners of war and
provision of aid to the affected Afghan people.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan opposition delegation was met at the airport by N.
Gobi, head of the U.N. Afghan mission in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Gobi said the modalities of the Steering Committee meeting will
be decided on Friday by the representatives of the Taliban and the
Northern Alliance themselves.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question on the duration of the talks, Gobi
said: "It depends on how the process moves forward."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.N. officials had a hectic day Thursday preparing
ground work for the Steering Committee meeting, which would seek
ways of achieving permanent peace in the war-torn Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia has sent a five-member delegation led by
Wakil Ahmed for the forthcoming meeting.
</P>
<P>
The assistant secretary general of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference (OIC), Ibrahim Saleh Bakar, is scheduled to
arrive here on Friday for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is being held under the auspices of the United
Nations and OIC.
</P>
<P>
It would be the first face-to-face meeting between the Taliban
and the Northern Alliance since September 1996 when the Taliban
took over the Afghan capital of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Bringing the rival factions to the negotiating table has been
deemed a major diplomatic achievement of Pakistan, in
collaboration with the Iranian authorities.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Investor to Build Garden City in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong-based New World
Group will invest 10 billion yuan (1.2 billion US dollars) to
build a garden city on a large tract of wasteland in this capital
of Liaoning Province in the coming decade, according to a contract
signed here recently.
</P>
<P>
The garden city will cover 1.9 million square meters which used
to be wasteland, marshes or shanties on the northern bank of the
Hunhe River south of Shenyang. The best architect designers will
be invited to give the latest overall layout for the garden city.
</P>
<P>
Two billion yuan (2.4 billion US dollars) will be used to start
the project such as removing 100 enterprises and 1,200 households.
</P>
<P>
After the project is completed, it will be turned into a modern
residential area dotted with up-to-date recreation centers, green
belts and scenic spots.
</P>
<P>
So far, the New World Group has poured more than 28 billion
yuan (3.37 billion US dollars) into joint venture projects in many
parts of China. Its cooperation with Shenyang started in
1993. About one billion yuan (120 million US dollars) has been
used in building hotels, residential housing and waterworks in
Shenyang.

<HEADLINE> IMF to Focus on Economic Growth, Real Sector in Next </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Economic growth and the problems
of the real sector in Thailand will be the focus of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) during its next review of the
country's economy, the Nation newspaper reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Thai Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, returning
Thursday from the G-22 finance ministers' meeting in Washington,
said the IMF will send representatives to Thailand between May 4
and 14 to assess the economic scenario and progress in
implementation of the IMF bailout conditions.
</P>
<P>
An important factor in the next review is economic growth, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Growth is hampered because the real sector has been affected
by baht volatility, liquidity crunch and a sharp contraction of
consumer purchasing power," Tarrin was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has predicted that Thailand's economy this year would
experience negative growth of between 3 and 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tarrin said the IMF will also delve deeper into the
real sector problems, and there will be new measures concerning
financial institutions' stabilization.
</P>
<P>
Thai manufacturers, exporters and some academics have long
complained of high interest rates and the liquidity crisis,
blaming them on the government-IMF imposition of a tight monetary
policy.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, deputy prime minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi and other members of the Council of Economic
Ministers Monday adopted supplementary measures to encourage
state-owned banks to lend.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin declined to comment on the possibility that the IMF will
allow Thailand to relax the current austere monetary policies in
order to lower the interest rates and increase money supply.
</P>
<P>
Whether the IMF will ease the austerity program depends on the
readiness of Thailand and the results of existing measures, Tarrin
said.
</P>
<P>
There are signs of improvement in investor confidence, with
foreign capital returning and the baht becoming more stable,
Tarrin added.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister also said that he met IMF Managing
Director Michel Camdessus to discuss topics related to the fourth
letter of intent to the IMF.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Leads March to Mark Holocaust Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu led thousands of people in a march in southern Poland on
Thursday to remember the six million Jews killed in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
Senior Polish leaders including Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek
joined Netanyahu in the march, reported the Polish Press Agency.
</P>
<P>
The participants of the march, including 6,500 young Jews from
40 countries and 1,000 survivors of the Holocaust, walked three
kilometers from Auschwitz to Birkenau, a route once taken by many
of those who were then gassed and burned in vast crematoria.
</P>
<P>
Nazi troops killed up to 1.5 million people, most of them Jews
brought in from all over Europe, in the Auschwitz-Birkenau death
camp.
</P>
<P>
A powerful Jewish state provided the sole guarantee against the
slaughter of Jews, said Netanyahu near the ruins of the massive
gas chambers and crematoria at Birkenau.
</P>
<P>
"A Jewish state would have made it impossible to kill millions
of Jews, indeed to kill any Jews with impunity," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony, called the March of the Living, was organized
regularly since 1988 to help young Jews to comprehend the
Holocaust. Thursday was Israel's Holocaust Martyrs and Heroes
Remembrance Day.
</P>
<P>
Participants will go on to Israel for next week's celebrations
marking the 50th anniversary of the founding of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu arrived in Poland shortly before the march for a
20-hour working visit. He went to Warsaw for talks with Buzek on
international issues and bilateral relations after the ceremony.

<P>
SIEM REAP, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's deposed first prime
minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh left here Friday morning for
Bangkok, ending his three-day visit to his father, King Norodom
Sihanouk.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Ranariddh told reporters that he will
come back home next month and stay in Cambodia until the elections
are held.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in the North Cambodian town of Siem Reap,
Ranariddh met with the King twice and discussed issues of common
concern.
</P>
<P>
The prince noted Thursday that the National United Front,
comprising Funcinpec, Sam Rainsy Party, Son Sann Party and Khmer
Neutral Party, will send a letter next week to U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan to reaffirm their support for the U.N. proposed
conditions for Cambodian elections.
</P>
<P>
He also vowed that the four-party union would boycott the
elections if they believed the elections would not be free and
fair and held under U.N. conditions.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh and the King said during their meeting that they
support the recruitment of as many international observers as
possible for the July 26 polls.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sources say Cambodia's Second Prime Minister Hun Sen
is scheduled to travel to Siem Reap on May 1 to see King Norodom
Sihanouk and then make a long-awaited official visit to
Thailand. The date, however, has not been confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The two trips will be Hun Sen's first public appearances since
his mother died in early March. Since then he has not spoken
publicly or met with anyone outside of his inner circle.

<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- China's exports to non-Asian
regions in the world jumped in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the State Statistics Bureau (SSB) Qiu Xiaohua

China has registered a 13.2 percent increase in total exports
during January to March over the same period of last year, with a
trade surplus of over 10 billion US dollars in the period.
</P>
<P>
However, Qiu said that exports to Asia grew at a lower rate due
to the financial turmoil that hit many countries and region in
Asia.

SSB statistics showed that exports to Asia grew by only 4.8
percent in the first quarter of this year over the same period of

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Ninety-two new projects were
built at the Waigaoqiao bonded zone in Shanghai in the first
quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
These projects involved a total investment of 101 million
U.S. dollars, up 86 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The amount of foreign investment covered in signed contracts
totaled 53.5 million U.S. dollars in the first quarter,
representing a 50-percent rise compared with last year.
</P>
<P>
A local trade official attributed the sharp increase of foreign
investment in the region to the Chinese government's firm support
to the development of Pudong New Area and the attractiveness of
Pudong as an investment spot.
</P>
<P>
The 6.4-sq km bonded zone has approved 3,236 foreign-funded
projects with an investment of 3.9 billion U.S. dollars since it
was founded. Its industrial output value was 6.7 billion yuan with
an import and export value of 2.8 billion U.S. dollars, and it

<HEADLINE> Dengue Death Toll Climbs to 422 in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from this year's
dengue fever outbreak in various parts of Indonesia has risen to
at least 422 with more than 16,000 others infected, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Health Ministry said Thursday the fatalities
recorded since January came from 11 of Indonesia's 27 provinces.
The central government has labeled the dengue outbreak
"extraordinary" and called for a nationwide mosquito eradication
program.
</P>
<P>
The number of death recorded is believed to be only a fraction
of the actual number of fatalities throughout the country,
officials said, citing the reason that only four provinces had
filed casualties to the ministry this month.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, is the hardest hit and the
epidemic has triggered a blood transfusion crisis with scores of
patients' relatives reportedly forced to spend more than a day
waiting in the understaffed Jakarta chapter of the Indonesia Red
Cross (PMI).
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers reported Friday that at least 5,400 people in
Jakarta with the disease had been hospitalized in the past four
months and 54 people had died.
</P>
<P>
The death toll is expected to rise, as government-run hospitals
and blood donor agencies in Jakarta do not have a sufficient
supply of blood badly needed by the dengue patients, said the
reports.
</P>
<P>
Dengue fever, an acute, cholera like disease, claimed 235 lives
in Indonesia last year and infected 13,047 people, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The tropical disease, transmitted by mosquitoes, leaves its
victims with fever, rash and severe pains in the joints and back.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Local Police have arrested two
banned soccer players for alleged involvement in fixing matches in
last year's national championship competition, the newspaper Young
Ages reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Truong Van Duong and Nguyen Phuc Nguyen Chuong, both of the Ho
Chi Minh City Customs team, were arrested at their homes on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Duong was given a lifetime ban last month by the Vietnam
Football Federation (VFF) and Chuong a two-year suspension for
their alleged roles in the scandal that has rocked the sport in
soccer-mad Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Ho Chi Minh City police also have arrested eight bookies on
gambling charges.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports, at least 74 players and managers
were involved in fixing matches. The VFF has banned a second
player and suspended five other players and four managers.

<HEADLINE> Economists Confident in Growth Acceleration (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- China's mainstream economists
today say that they are confident of the eight percent growth of
the country's economy this year, despite a further slowdown in
the past three months.
</P>
<P>
In separate interviews with Xinhua today, a number of prominent
economists shared the view that the trend of economic deceleration
will be reversed later this year as the government has adopted a
series of measures to stimulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
The State Statistics Bureau (SSB) announced this morning that
the national economy grew by 7.2 percent in the first quarter this
year, compared to 8.8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
"Such a slowdown was due to the lagging effect of the battle
against inflation in the previous years as well as the negative
impact on China's exports by the Southeast Asian financial
crisis," said Liu Shucheng, a leading economist with the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences (CASS).
</P>
<P>
But since the end of last year, the central authorities have
made appropriate policy readjustments, concentrating on
stimulating domestic demand to ensure a steady economic growth,
Liu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Our model analysis indicates that investment growth is
accelerating gradually and most likely to surpass 15 percent
throughout this year, which will lay a solid ground for an eight
percent economic growth this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the SSB, fixed-asset investment grew 10.3 percent
in the first quarter, while foreign direct investment rose by
around 10 percent.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Faces Highest Risk of Dengue in 40 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The incidence of dengue fever in
Thailand is expected to reach its highest level in 40 years this
year, affecting some 300,000 people, the Ministry of Public Health
has warned.
</P>
<P>
Friday's Bangkok Post quoted Public Health Minister Rakkiat
Sukthana as saying that changes in climate as a result of the
global warming effects of the El Nino and inadequate preventive
measures are to blame.
</P>
<P>
Usually dengue fever occurs only during the monsoon season. But
since last year, it has been escalating through the cool and hot
season, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
In the first three months of this year, the disease claimed 31
lives and infected 10,197 people, a three-fold increase over the
previous corresponding period when it took eight lives and
infected 3,280 people.
</P>
<P>
Reports of patients treated in state hospitals show that 70-75
percent of patients with dengue fever are between 5 and 14 years
of age.
</P>
<P>
An expert at the Communicable Disease Control Department said
most doctors tend to overlook the possible occurrence of dengue
fever among older children or young adults and often suspect them
of being infected with other diseases.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Permanent Secretary of Public Health Vinai Viriyakijja
said that since most infections occur in schools and communities,
a mass campaign to destroy mosquitoes and sources of their
breeding will be launched between June 15 and 19 in 800 districts
throughout the country.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for More Agricultural Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- China has called for strengthening
regional food and agricultural cooperation and expressed readiness
to join hands with FAO and other nations in making new
contributions to improving agriculture and food security in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a two-day ministerial meeting of the 24th Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) Regional Conference for Asia and
the Pacific, Chinese Vice Minister of Agriculture Wan Baorui, who
led a nine-member delegation to the conference, urged Asian and
Pacific countries to strengthen economic and technical cooperation
in the field of food and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He also asked developed countries in the region to provide
necessary assistance to agricultural development in developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Asia and Pacific region has witnessed rapid growth in its
food and agricultural production and further improvement of its
food security in recent years, he said. However, he noted, the
region is still faced with an arduous task of developing food and
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He stated that Asia and Pacific countries should intensify
their food and agricultural production in the face of the present
unfavorable situation arising from the financial crisis in
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Asian and Pacific countries should attach
great importance to food and agricultural production, increase
inputs through multiple channels and speed up the development of
agricultural technology.
</P>
<P>
Countries in the region should also pay special attention to
the development and utilization of limited agricultural resources
by engaging in integrated development and diversified farming
activities, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the holding of the World Food Summit in
1996 has opened a new chapter in mankind's efforts to eradicate
hunger and poverty and improve food security.
</P>
<P>
The vice minister emphasized that the Chinese government has
always attached great importance to agriculture and food security
and regards feeding the people as its primary concern. After the
World Food Summit, he pointed out, the Chinese government has
taken policy measures aimed at strengthening and protecting
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He told the conference that in 1997, China produced 492.5
million tons of grains, 53.54 million tons of meat, 35.61 million
tons of fish and other seafood and 50.54 million tons of fruit.
</P>
<P>
He said China will continue to uphold the policy of putting
agriculture on the top of its economic agenda and deepening rural
reforms.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that with the unswerving efforts of its people,
China would be able to realize the goals set for the country's
agricultural and rural economic development.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which began Monday with a three-day senior
officials meeting and a two-day ministerial meeting, is the first
regional gathering of agricultural ministers since the 1996 World
Food Summit in Rome, Italy. Attending the meetings are 150
representatives from 26 FAO member countries in Asia and the
Pacific, U.N. agencies and non-governmental organizations.

<HEADLINE> China's Economy Grows 7.2 Percent in First Quarter (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- China's economic growth slowed
down to 7.2 percent in the first quarter this year, compared to
the annual rate of eight percent in 1997, the State Statistics
Bureau (SSB) said here this morning.
</P>
<P>
The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) totaled 1,589.9 billion yuan
during the Janurary-March period, SSB spokesman Qiu Xiaohua told a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
Inflation continued the downward trend, with the consumer price
index (CPI) rising only 0.3 percent over the corresponding period
of last year and the retail price index (RPI) falling by 1.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
"The overall situation of the Chinese economy is basically
normal," Qiu said, While pointing out that a most prominent
problem confronting the economy still lies with the sliding
economic efficiency of the country's industries.
</P>
<P>
A breakdown showed that the nation's agriculture, industry,
and service sector grew four percent, 7.8 percent, and seven
percent over the same period last year, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The output value of the nation's industrial sector hit 442.1
billion yuan during the period, with the growth rate dropping 2.8
percent to 8.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The economic efficiency of the industrial enterprises
decreased, with the total industrial profits plunging by 82.8
percent during the first two months.
</P>
<P>
"But we can still count on a full realization of the annual
economic growth of eight percent this year, with the deepening of
the reform drive and a successful expansion of the domestic
demand," stressed the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
In separate interviews with Xinhua today, a number of prominent
economists shared the view that the trend of economic deceleration
will be reversed later this year as the government has adopted a
series of measures to stimulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of last year, the central authorities have made
appropriate policy readjustments, concentrating on stimulating
domestic demand to ensure a steady economic growth, noted Liu
Shucheng, a leading economist with the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences.
</P>

accelerating gradually and most likely to surpass 15 percent
throughout this year, which will lay a solid ground for an eight

<TEXT>
<P>
Kathie Krumm, Chief for Economics of the WB Resident Mission in
China, also pointed out that China is in a solid position to
stimulate its economy and absorb external shock.
</P>
<P>
"China's economy is like a huge ship whose direction cannot be
changed within a one-quarter adjustment, " Krumm said, adding that
"the acceleration will appear in coming quarters gradually, if
investment expands."
</P>
<P>
In the real scene, China registered a "steady growth" of 10.3
percent in fixed-asset investment, which totaled 161.8 billion
yuan during the first three months.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Chinese economic growth already started to pick up
in March, Qiu Xiaohua told the press conference.
</P>
<P>
"The pick-up trend is indicated in a growing money supply,
increasing bank lendings and industrial growth beginning from
March," Qiu explained.
</P>
<P>
The growth of the total industrial output value stayed at eight
percent during the first two months and rose to nine percent in
March, which brought the average growth rate up to 8.2 percent,
according to the SSB spokesman.
</P>
<P>
In foreign trade sector, China registered a trade surplus of
10.64 billion US dollars, with exports up by 13.2 percent to 40.24
billion US dollars and imports up by 2.7 percent to 29.6 billion
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
A total of 8.596 billion US dollars of overseas direct
investment flowed into the country during the period, up 9.7
percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The state foreign exchange reserve rose to 140.6 billion US
dollars at the end of March, an increase of 700 million US dollars
from the figure at the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
"From a long-term point of view, China's economy has a solid
material basis and adequate support from the national policies,"
Qiu stressed.
</P>
<P>
"To ensure China's economy to grow eight percent this year, the
whole nation needs to fully implement the related policies,
especially those designed to stimulate domestic demand growth,
optimize the economic structure and increase efficiency, " Qiu
said.

Li Shantong, senior researcher with the State Council's
Development Research Center, told Xinhua that the economic
forecasting team she leads has used another model to analyse the
trend of economic growth and the results were similar to Liu's.
</P>
<P>
"Given the present policy orientation and economic environment,
we predict conservatively a six to eight percent export growth and
a fifteen percent investment growth, which will be enough for
realizing the eight-percent economic growth target," she said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the economists agreed that the initiatives
taken by the central authorities will need some time to produce
substantial effects and economic growth is not expected to pick up
strongly until the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
"Some problems are still to be addressed. Although the
government has decided to expand investment, it usually takes more
than three months to choose and approve a project, and the real
start of a project may need another three months," Fan Gang, a
former CASS economist, said.
</P>
<P>
"But my judgment is that this time the central authorities
have been determined to stimulate the economy and a number of
measures have been put into place. So I believe the growth target
for this year will be reached," Fan said.

-- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday led the March
of Living, attended by 7,000 Holocaust survivors and young Jews
from around the world, from Auschwitz to the gas chambers at
Birkenau in Poland. Netanyahu said the only lesson Jews have

Jewish faith.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel is weighing sanctions against Russian companies over
their arms trade with Iran after the Foreign Ministry received a

due to high radiation. Satellite pictures showed Iran has
completed building a secret missile base in the western part of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Maariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Senior officials in Jerusalem believed that Netanyahu will
carry out the second troop redeployment in the West Bank within a

Israel and the Palestinian side during their visit here in the
coming days.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>

London early next month will be a failure, if the U.S. insists on
its demand for a 13 percent Israeli withdrawal in the second
redeployment.

<HEADLINE> Fostering Successors For Sino-Japanese Friendship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao
said here Friday it's an important task for China and Japan to
foster successors for the cause of Sino-Japanese friendship.
</P>
<P>
Hu, here on a visit to Japan, made the remarks in separate
meetings with three former Japanese prime ministers -- Yasuhiro
Nakasone, Noboru Takeshita and Kiichi Miyazawa.
</P>
<P>
The three former prime ministers and many other veteran
Japanese politicians, said the Chinese vice president, have made
great contributions to the normalization of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
As Sino-Japanese friendship matures, bring up young people,
especially young politicians, and educate younger generations with
the spirit of friendship have become an important task, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hu expressed the hope that the three former Japanese prime
ministers would continue playing a big role in this aspect.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral ties have made remarkable progress. A solid
foundation has been laid for cooperation since the normalization
of diplomatic relations thanks to the joint efforts by politicians
of older-generation of the two countries, the two governments and
people from all walks of life, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
The hard-won Sino-Japanese friendship should be treasured, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The two countries should learn lessons from history, handle
issues with a strategic point of view, and work to build
Sino-Japanese good-neighborly cooperative ties oriented towards
the 21st century, Hu added.
</P>
<P>
Nakasone said Japan and China, both playing increasingly
important roles on the political area of the Asia-Pacific region
and the world as the next century approaches, should increase
mutual trust and expand cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Takeshita told Hu that he would regard the promotion of
exchanges between the young people of the two countries as an
important cause in the rest of his life and make new contributions
to the friendship of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Miyazawa said the expansion of dialogue and cooperation between
Japan and China would bring about positive impact to the
Asian-Pacific region, and Japan is willing to work for enhancing
bilateral ties with China.

<HEADLINE> Zambia C. Bank Reiterates No Foreign Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Zambia (BOZ), a
central bank, has reiterated that it has no intentions of
reintroducing foreign exchange controls, state-owned Times of
Zambia reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here Thursday, according to the paper,
BOZ spokesman Kabinga Pande announced that the country's current
liberalized foreign exchange scenario will continue and no
measures inconsistent with this will be introduced.
</P>
<P>
He said the liberalized market environment is a cornerstone of
the Zambian government's economic policy and that this policy is
still in place.
</P>
<P>
These remarks followed earlier reports this week that quoted a
senior official of the central bank saying BOZ is to reintroduce
foreign exchange regulations.
</P>
<P>
The BOZ spokesman asked the public and the business community
not to panic as the government and the central bank has no
intention of deviating from current economic policies.
</P>
<P>
He stressed hat there are no plans whatsoever to revert to any
kind of controls.
</P>
<P>
Zambia abandoned its foreign exchange controls in the early
1990s when the country began to implement its liberalized market
policies.
</P>
<P>
However, the country since the end of last year has
experienced a critical shortage of foreign exchange due to high
demand and low inflows from the copper sale and it is now runing
out of its foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Zambian Kwacha continues depreciating from
1,330 last October to 1,900 against U.S. Dollars this week. The
central bank seems to have no means to curb such a situation.

<HEADLINE> Russian Passenger Plane Catches Fire in Istanbul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A Russian passenger plane caught
fire at the Ataturk Airport in Istanbul early Friday, but causing
no casualties, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Ilyushin-62 plane from Istanbul to Alma Ata, Kazakhstan,
was found in fire at its tail part before take-off at 00:25 local
time (2125 GMT Thursday), the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The fire forced emergency evacuation of all 64 passengers and
nine crew members on board. An explosion occurred in the right
motor of the plane soon after the evacuation, according to the
news agency.
</P>
<P>
It said a Turkish fire brigade poured six tonnes of chemical
materials and 30 tonnes of water to prevent the fire from
spreading to the plane depot, which contained 50 tonnes of fuel.
</P>
<P>
The fire, which started in the cargo hold, cause serious
damages to the four motors of the plane, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
Investigations into the cause of the fire are underway.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Economy Remains Sluggish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's economy remains
sluggish in the first quarter of this year due to negative
financial factors, the daily Herald reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe Financial Holdings (Finhold) said Thursday that
Zimbabwe's economic performance continued in the first quarter of
this year with declines in the growth rates of the manufacturing,
mining and agricultural sectors.
</P>
<P>
The sluggish growth of the manufacturing sector was largely
due to high operating costs precipitated by high interest rates
and the impact of last november's sharp depreciation of the
Zimbabwean Dollars, the leading financial group said.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the economy for the six months ending March 31,
1998, Finhold said that government borrowing from the banking
sector continued to increase money supply growth, pushing
inflation high.
</P>
<P>
"This, together with the sharp depreciation of the Zimbabwean
Dollar, had a negative impact on inflation which averaged 21.9
percent during the first six months of the 1997/98 fiscal year
compared to 17.5 percent during the same period of previous
year," said Finhold.
</P>
<P>
The group said that the mining sector remained depressed in
the period under review, mainly due to low prices on the
international mineral markets while in agriculture tobacco prices
were poor despite increased yields and a high quality crop.
</P>
<P>
However, Finhold lauded the recent launching of the second
phase economic reforms, the Zimbabwe Program for Economic and
Social Transformation, saying that it refocused the country on
the priorities needed to achieve macro-economic stability.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States has renewed
its interest in the war-torn Afghanistan after years of
disinterest following the withdrawal from the country of the
troops of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The rekindled U.S. interest in Afghanistan, which has been
suffering from endless wars for decades, is evident from the
latest visit to the country by U.S. President Bill Clinton's
special envoy and U.S. Permanent Representative to the United
Nations Bill Richardson.
</P>
<P>
Richardson made a day-long trip to Afghanistan on April 17,
becoming the highest-ranking U.S. official to have stepped on
Afghan soil in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The visit has been hailed as a "turning point" after years of
apparent U.S. lack of interest in the Afghan issue and analysts
here see it as the sign of growing U.S. interest in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
It indicates a recognition in the United States that Washington
can no longer afford to ignore Afghanistan in any of its
strategies for the region.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Afghanistan, Richardson held separate talks
with leaders of the Taliban militia and the Anti-Taliban Northern
Alliance. As a result, the two Afghan rival factions agreed for
the first time to meet face-to-face on April 25 in Islamabad,
capital of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Although the situation in Afghanistan never lacks the element
of unpredictability and it is hard to forecast what will turn out
if the proposed meeting is held, the agreement represents, by any
means, the first dawn on the Afghan horizon since September 1996
when the Taliban took over the capital of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
It is clear that Washington is now pushing for an early and
swift resumption of multi-party dialogue in Afghanistan. However,
the question remains of what has led to the renewed U.S. interest
in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
It is clear that the U.S. bid for peace in Afghanistan has two
distinct goals.
</P>
<P>
The first and short-term one is to mediate an immediate
cease-fire and end hostilities among the warring factions and give
further impetus to the U.N. peace initiative.
</P>
<P>
The second and longer-term goal is to create a framework which
can eventually lead to the desired establishment of a
broadly-based government in that war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
But these are only the apparent reasons for the fresh U.S.
interest in the Afghan issue. There are also other considerations
which are of strategic importance.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here noted that the United States first got involved
in the Afghan issue because its security interests were under the
threat of the former Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan, which
could eventually result in the Soviet Union's access to warm-water
sea ports.
</P>
<P>
With the withdrawal of the Soviet troops and the later
disintegration of the Soviet Union, the threat to U.S. interests
receded.
</P>
<P>
However, the Americans believe that such a threat, or a
potential one, now seems re-emerging for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
First, Afghanistan has become the world's largest opium
producer and is one of the most critical points on the route
through which most drugs are smuggled into Europe and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The United States has made constant efforts to curb drug
smuggling and eradicate poppy production in and around
Afghanistan. However, the efforts have produced limited success.
</P>
<P>
The Americans have finally realized that better results could
be achieved only through deeper engagement and by ending
Afghanistan's endless civil war.
</P>
<P>
Second, Afghanistan has been a place where arms smugglers are
active. Although the problem of arms smuggling does not bother the
United States as much as drug smuggling so long as its destination
remains to be Pakistan, Washington could hardly afford to remain
indifferent when terrorists begin looking for U.S. targets.
</P>
<P>
Third, the long-running civil war in Afghanistan could
jeopardize U.S. trade interests in the fast-developing markets of
Central Asian republics. Exports to and from these
newly-independent countries could be carried out much more
profitably through Afghanistan than through other countries.
</P>
<P>
Last but not least, Afghanistan is the key to integrating
natural resources-rich Central Asia into the global economy and to
exploiting the region's investment and business potential.
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, American companies have developed a huge
financial stake in Central Asia and are desperate for gaining
access to the region's rich energy resources and developing trade
links with it.
</P>
<P>
All these factors are believed to have made Afghanistan a
crucial point for renewed U.S. interests, as reflected by the
visit of Richardson.
</P>
<P>
Yet the U.S. efforts to create "a broadly-based government" in
Afghanistan would mean nothing if the Taliban, which control more
than two-thirds of Afghan territory, do not accept the idea of
power sharing with its rival factions.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN-China Trade Increases 22 Percent in 1997 </HEADLINE>

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Trade between China and the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) amounted to 25
billion U.S. dollars in 1997, up 22 percent from 1996, the
Jakarta-based ASEAN Secretariat said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"However, Chinese investments in ASEAN are much lower than
ASEAN investments in China and only in recent years did Chinese
investors begin to make their presence felt in the ASEAN region,"
it said in a statement released here.
</P>
<P>
To improve Sino-ASEAN economic ties, China will send a
delegation comprising senior representatives of major state-owned
enterprises to several ASEAN countries before the end of the
month, it said.
</P>
<P>
"The delegation will look into economic opportunities with a
view to increasing Chinese investments and economic relations with
ASEAN members," it said.
</P>
<P>
According to its tentative itinerary, the delegation will visit
Manila, Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok. The trip would be organized by
the China Council for Promotion of International Trade.
</P>
<P>
In addition, leading Chinese entrepreneurs from the All-China
Federation of Industry and Commerce would organize an ASEAN tour
in May, it said.
</P>
<P>
The secretariat said China has provided Thailand with 1 billion
 dollars of soft loans and Indonesia with 600 million dollars of
soft loans and export credits to help ease the liquidity squeeze
in the two ASEAN economies.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Cabinet Minister Tenders Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 24 (Xinhua) -- In a first blow to Prime
Minister Girija Prasad Koirala who took office a week ago, one of
his cabinet ministers has been forced to tender resignation for
failing to effectively deal with corruption in the country.
</P>
<P>
Government sources confirmed Friday that Khum Bahadur Khadka,
minister for forest and soil conservation and supplies, on
Thursday offered to resign under pressure from MPs of his own
Nepali Congress (NC) party.
</P>
<P>
Khadka, who was home minister in the former government led by
Surya Bahadur Thapa, has been held responsible by his colleagues
for the upsurge in corruption and smuggling in the country.
</P>
<P>
Most MPs of the NC boycotted parliament sessions for a second
straight day Thursday to vent their anger against the induction of
tainted MPs into the cabinet, The Kathmandu Post said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Amar Raj Kaini, minister of state for industry and labor, has
been refusing to take the oath of office since he was picked up by
Koirala Tuesday in his expansion of the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Before Koirala expanded his cabinet, MPs from his own party,
the NC, had pressured him to refrain from inducting MPs perceived
as corrupt.
</P>
<P>
The Kathmandu Post said some agitated NC MPs on Thursday
gathered at Koirala's official residence and reminded him of the
NC General Committee resolution adopted last year which directs
the party leadership to deal with corruption with an iron hand and
stresses the necessity to maintain a clean image of the party when
in government.
</P>
<P>
The present government, which came to power on April 15, is a
minority government of the NC, the largest party in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Koirala, who is president and parliamentary leader of the NC,
had agreed to convene a formal meeting of the parliamentary party
on Saturday to "sort out the issue," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted sources close to Koirala as saying he could
well dismiss a couple of more ministers in the days to come.

<HEADLINE> Manila Light Rail Workers Strike Enters Second Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A strike by workers of the
Philippines' only Light Rail Transit (LRT) entered its second day
Friday with no relief in sight, stranding thousands of commuters
in Manila and nearby suburbs.
</P>
<P>
Police trucks were filled but they were not able to bring most
of the commuters to their destinations.
</P>
<P>
LRT General Manager Moises Tolentino assured the public that an
announcement on the resumption of LRT operations will be made
during the day.
</P>
<P>
He said that about 400 workers of the 14-year-old industry have
not joined the strike which began at 3 a.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
These non-strikers are believed to be the ones set to be
shielded in case train operation resumes.
</P>
<P>
The striking workers are asking for a 3,500-peso
across-the-board monthly salary increase this year and 3,000 pesos
a month in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The LRT management offered a 1,000-peso monthly pay raise for
1998 starting February and another 1,000 pesos in monthly wages
for 1999, but the striking workers rejected the offer.
</P>
<P>
Tolentino said the LRT spends about 45 percent of their annual
income on wages alone.
</P>
<P>
Last year, he said, the LRT had an income of 1.2 billion pesos,
and part of the income will be used for the operation of 28
additional air-conditioned coaches.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Labor and Employment is expected to issue a
return-to-work order Friday.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The South African army is
on standby and extra police units have been deployed in Soweto,
Johannesburg, to curb renewed clashes between taxi organizations,
the daily Star reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Two platoons of the South African National Defense Force,
numbering about 48 men, were waiting to be deployed Thursday
night to reinforce the police.
</P>
<P>
Four people have been killed in the clashes in Soweto this
week.
</P>
<P>
The Soweto violence, which coincides with a nationwide
resurgence in taxi warfare, has disrupted public transport in the
giant black township as many taxi owners have opted to keep their
vehicles off the roads.
</P>
<P>
Of the 61 people killed across the country so far this year,
40 died in Gauteng Province, where Soweto is situated, and eight
in Kwazulu-Natal.
</P>
<P>
Long-standing tensions between two rival groups in Pretoria --
the Federated Local and Long Distance Taxi Association and the
South African Local and Long Distance Taxi Association -- have
accounted for the high number of deaths.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Accuses U.S. of Politicizing Drug Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has accused the U.S. of
politicizing the west African country's drug problems, saying
that the continued decertification of Nigeria by the U.S. despite
all that the country has done makes the issue laughable.
</P>
<P>
Major-General Musa Bamaiyi, head of the National Drug Law
Enforcement Agency of Nigeria, said this at a press conference
Thursday in Abuja, during the 10th Summit of Heads of National
Drug Law Enforcement Agencies in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"I think from every perspective, the U.S. has already
politicized the drug issues. So, whether we do very well or very
badly, it makes no difference to them, and the report will be the
same," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bamaiyi pointed out that "America is entitled to its opinion.
Nigeria as a sovereign nation is equally entitled to its own
opinion. The only sad aspect is that pointing accusing fingers
or exchanging such blames will never help resolve the global
program of action."
</P>
<P>
He explained that the two countries should identify their
differences and try to sort them out in the best interest of the
global action plan on drugs.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the press conference, Tony White, an official
from the United Nations Drug Control Program (UNDCP), promised
that the UNDCP will help African countries draw up necessary
legislations on money laundering and assets confiscation, which
he said is essential to stop the increasing drug trade.

<P>
MANILA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Peace negotiators of the
Philippine government and the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) ended another round of low-level talks Thursday and agreed
to meet again after the May 11 elections, a rebel leader said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF deputy chairman for political affairs,
said the two panels will meet on a still undetermined date after
the elections to study further pending proposals of the peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He said that due to stale discussions over the issue of
repositioning their respective combatants in Upper Minabay
village, Buldon, the southern province of Maguindanao, negotiators
decided to reset their meeting to come up with a more appropriate
decision on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Jaafar said that if not because of the controversial Buldon
issue, negotiators might have undertaken the agenda on recognition
of MILF territories in Mindanao and the much-awaited formal talks
schedule in the just-concluded two-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader said they also anticipate a possible change of
government panel members in the next meeting "considering the
impending change of administration."
</P>
<P>
Jaafar, however, expressed optimism that whoever becomes the
next Philippine president, "the MILF is assured of continuity of
the peace talks."

<HEADLINE> Divorce Becomes Easier for S. Africans: Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Divorce has become cheaper
and easier for all South Africans following the passing of a new
divorce law which came into effect in early April, the daily
Sowetan reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 Divorce Courts Amendment Act, which came into
operation on April 6, makes provision for a divorce procedure
which is uncomplicated and affordable and does not enforce the
requirement of legal representation.
</P>
<P>
The act was amended to replace the Black Administration Act of
1929 and Amendment Act of 1929.
</P>
<P>
The latest law makes divorce courts, which were previously
accessible only to whites, open to all population groups
irrespective of race or financial status throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Palesa Sedibe-Ncholo, special adviser to the Minister of
Justice, was quoted as saying that the act had made the laws
relating to divorce uniform, meaning, any person had a choice to
approach either the High Court or the divorce courts in order to
obtain a divorce.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the act will reach out to the lower rungs of
the courts will make justice cheaper and accessible,"
Sedibe-Ncholo said.
</P>
<P>
"Where litigants are unable to get their own legal
presentation, the clerks and registrars of the courts, who have
been trained, will assist such litigants."
</P>
<P>
Last year, 31,000 couples were separated in South Africa's
High courts. A total of 7,500 were separated in divorce courts
in 1995-96.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Promulgate Privatization Law Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will promulgate a new law
on the privatization of state-owned enterprises by the end of the
month, Finance Minister Anthony Ani has said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said in Washington that the law to guide the
privatization exercise had been drafted while other aspects of
the privatization program, including the appointment of
consultants and investment banks and evaluations had been worked
upon.
</P>
<P>
Ani, who was in Washington to attend the spring meetings of
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund said: "the
privatization strategy itself has been done and when the program
comes out, we will invite bids."
</P>
<P>
The minister said the privatization exercise will begin with
NITEL (Nigeria Telecommunications Corporation) as announced in
the 1998 budget by the government.
</P>
<P>
"We are doing guided privatization, we want to take on and do
it properly before we go onto others," Ani said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, finance is not the only factor in
choosing new investors for NITEL, instead, he said, Nigeria is
looking for core strategic investors with a combination of
expertise, managerial capacity and finance.
</P>
<P>
Besides NITEL, the National Electric Power Authority, as well
as the oil refineries, the petrochemical, bitumen, coal and
leisure sectors will all be privatized, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Adopts New Population Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- South Africa Thursday
released a new population policy, which places the population at
the center of all development strategies.
</P>
<P>
"The new policy corrects grave errors of the past by adopting
sustainable human development as the central theme," Welfare and
Population Development Minister Geraldine Fraser-Molekiti was
quoted as saying by local daily Business Day Friday.
</P>
<P>
The policy was seen as a major departure from past policies
which were "aimed at curtailing fertility through the provision
of contraceptive services."
</P>
<P>
"The new policy places population at the center of all
development strategies and regards population as the driving
force and the ultimate beneficiary of development,"
Fraser-Molekiti said.
</P>
<P>
It embraced the view that South Africans, especially women and
the youth, should be empowered to take control of their own
lives.
</P>
<P>
The policy outlines 24 strategies to be employed to address
population concerns. Areas covered include poverty reduction;
employment; education; migration and urbanization; health,
mortality and fertility; gender, women, youth and children;
coordination and capacity building for integrating population and
development planning; advocacy and population information,
education and communication and data collection and research.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary census results in South Africa indicated a
population of 37.9 million, four million fewer than expected.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close Weaker as Bond Price Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Australian sharemarket
weakened at the close Friday, with the banking index leading it
down.
</P>
<P>
The All Ordinaries closed down 22.9 points, or 0.8 percent, at
2,854.9.
</P>
<P>
"It was a market where the buyers were prepared to stand out
and let the sellers stumble over each other," said Reynolds and
Co. broker Peter Struck.
</P>
<P>
Struck said a 111.7-point, or 1.82-percent, drop in the banking
index had led the fall. Bank stocks had fallen in response to
weaker global bond prices, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The banks are getting a bit of a pounding today, bonds came
out well and the American market started this off," Struck said.
</P>
<P>
All four major Australian banks were weaker. National Australia
Bank lost 43 cents to 22.92 Australian dollars on a heavy turnover
of 23.7 million shares and Westpac bank lost 33 cents to 10.69
Australian dollars while ANZ bank fell 20 cents to 11.4 Australian
dollars and Commonwealth Bank dropped 20 cents to 18.73 Australian
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the All Industrials Index lost 49.5 points, or 1.01
percent, to 4,875.7 and the All Resources Index lost 0.1 point, or
0.01 percent, to 1,245.7.
</P>
<P>
Among the major resources stocks, BHP dropped 16.1 cents to
15.459 Australian dollars on a turnover of 12 million shares while
Rio Tinto gained 40 cents to 22.3 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The gold index failed to repeat Thursday's sharp rally and
finished down 6.1 points, or 0.43 percent, at 1,422.4.
</P>
<P>
In Sydney, gold was trading at 313.2 U.S. dollars an ounce late
Friday, down from 313.35 U.S. dollars at Thursday night's close.
</P>
<P>
Overall, national turnover was 632.7 million shares, valued at
143.26 million U.S. dollars. Falls of 594 outnumbered rises of 495
stocks.

CANBERRA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar dipped
lower in afternoon trading to finish near its lows for Friday.
</P>
<P>
The local unit closed at 65.12 U.S. cents from 65.25 late
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Stuart Moore, manager of foreign exchange trading of St. George
Bank, said the market finished in negative territory after opening
on Friday morning with an initial rise.
</P>
<P>
The local currency began the session at 65.35 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
"The market is focusing on the Japanese package, due out in a
few hours," Moore said.
</P>
<P>
The waterfront dispute continued Friday as stevedoring company
Patrick went to the High Court in a new bid to overturn Thursday
night's ruling by the full bench of the Federal Court, which
upheld an earlier order to the company to reinstate 1,400
unionists fired two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
High Court Judge Ken Hayne Friday extended a stay on the
reinstatement order until 17:00 (local time) Monday or until
further orders.
</P>
<P>
Some experts say the dispute, which is expected to be
prolonged, would affect the local foreign exchange market and the
nation's trade.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Australian dollar also ended at 84.65 Japanese
yen from 84.95 yen and at 1.1707 Deutsche marks from 1.17 marks.

MOSCOW, April 24 (Xinhua) - The State Duma, lower house of
Russian parliament, on Friday voted to hold secret ballot in the
third confirmation vote on Sergei Kiriyenko's nomination as prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
The Duma started a session at 10:15 a.m. local time (0615GMT)

A call to hold an open ballot failed by the narrowest of
margins, 188 deputies voting for an open vote, 188 deputies voting
against with four abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Secret ballot is widely believed to increase the Kiriyenko's

<HEADLINE> Joint Venture to Produce Cheaper Irrigation Equipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Irrifrance Corp. announced today
that it will set up a joint venture in China to produce cheaper
irrigation equipment to cater to Chinese farmers.
</P>
<P>
At today's close of Agro Expo China '98, an official from the
French company said that he will go to east China's Shandong
Province to negotiate with government officials after the expo.
</P>
<P>
Irrigation technology had become a hot exhibition item on the
expo. Nearly 100 irrigation equipment producers and designers from
domestic and overseas firms attended the four-day exhibition,
making up 20 percent of the participants.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural experts said this indicates that the country --
not only the central government but also firms and farmers -- are
aware of the importance of water-saving irrigation.
</P>
<P>
China, with a per capita water availability of 2,300 cubic
meters, is one of 13 countries with the most serious water
shortage problems in the world.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 80 percent of the country's water supply flows to
farmers, but only 40 percent of the water is efficiently used.
</P>
<P>
To conserve water, the Ministry of Water Resources plans to
raise prices. It also plans to stop approving non-water-saving
agricultural projects this year.
</P>
<P>
Chinese farmers used to flood their grain crops. Water-saving
irrigation measures were only used for fruit and cash crops
in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1990s, new irrigation methods have been used for
field crops. So far, China has set up five model fields using new
methods with each covering more than 660,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
China will be the host of an international irrigation expo next
year, according to the Specialized Sub-Council of Agriculture
under the Chinese Council for Promotion of International Trade,
the organizer of Agro Expo China '98.

PARIS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Marc Dutroux, the man charged with murdering at least four
little girls in Belgium, escaped from his prison Thursday
afternoon. He was re-captured by the police some 20 kilometers
from his prison. The three-hour escape of the public enemy of
Belgium shook the country. The interior minister and minister of
justice resigned immediately at the demand of the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
-- The American media have accused the French army, which is
traditionally pro-Serb, of helping the Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic of escaping a plan by the NATO force to arrest him in the
summer of 1997. The Washington Post said on Thursday that a French
army officer, Commander Herve Gourmelon, had met Karadzic several
times in 1997 in breaking the rule of the allied force in Bosnia,
which created a gap between the U.S. and French troops.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- France was cut into two in terms of investment by foreigners
in the country last year. Three-fourth of the jobs created by
foreigners in France were on the eastern side of the the
Havre-Lyon-Marseille line, especially in the northeastern part of
the country which is close to the heart of Europe. Unemployment rate
has dropped in Alsace, Champagne-Ardenne, Rhone-Alpes,
Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur, while the Grand
West region or Languedoc-Rousillon has become a forgotten corner of
investors.
</P>
<P>
-- The French government recognized on Thursday the existence of
"relations" which "could have appeared contestable" between a
French army officer who used to serve in NATO force in Bosnia and
Bosnian Serb leaders accused of war crimes. But it denied that a
plan by American troops to arrest Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic last summer had been tipped off by the French officer,
Herve Gourmelon.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has offered for the
first time Chittagong port service to India, official sources said
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Bangladeshi special envoy and Foreign Minister Abdus
Samad Azad made the offer during his meeting with Indian leaders
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He offered the facility of the Chittagong port for the transit
of Indian goods to and from its northeastern areas.
</P>
<P>
He also informed Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee
when he called on him here on April 22 that a deep sea port
adjoining the existing port in Chittagong is being built at a cost
of 400 million U.S. dollars for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that Bangladesh has officially offered
the Chittagong port as a transit route to India.
</P>
<P>
India had been pleading with Bangladesh in the past decade to
grant it the use of this facility for the cheaper and easier flow
of its goods to its northeast.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Vajpayee assured Azad that his government
would abide by all the agreements entered into with Dhaka by
previous Indian governments, including the one on the sharing of
Ganges water. He said his government wants to further strengthen
the already existing friendly ties and have all kinds of
cooperation with Dhaka.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- China and Guinea Bissau
decided to resume diplomatic ties as of Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan and Fernando Delfim da
Silva, Guinea Bissau's minister of foreign affairs and
cooperation, signed a joint communique on the resumption of
diplomatic ties at the ambassadorial level in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
China had suspended its diplomatic ties with Guinea Bissau
from May 31, 1990.
</P>
<P>
Tang and da Silva held talks on bilateral relations and other
issues of common interest after the communique signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Tang called the resumption of diplomatic relations between
the two countries "a major event" in bilateral relations which is
in the fundamental interest of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of diplomatic ties put an end to the abnormal
stage in the bilateral relations and ushered in a new prospect of
friendly cooperation, Tang said. With the end of past twists and
turns, the resumption promises a healthy and stable development of
the bilateral relations in the future, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is willing to join hands with Guinea
Bissau in building up a long-term, friendly and all-round cooperative
bilateral relationship well into the 21st century, through
enhancing personnel exchanges, exploring new ways for bilateral
cooperation and strengthening consultation and cooperation on
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Da Silva said that Guinea Bissau enjoys traditional friendly
relations with China and gained valuable assistance from China in
the most difficult period of his country.
</P>
<P>
Da Silva called the resumption of diplomatic ties "the most
important moment" in the bilateral ties. China is an important
country in the world and has, over the past years, scored great
achievements well-known to the world. He said he was happy with
the resumption of the bilateral ties and hoped the event will push
the bilateral relations to a new height.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the significance of the event, Chinese foreign
minister Tang said the resumption of diplomatic ties with Guinea
Bissau, coupled with China's forging of diplomatic ties with South
Africa and resumption of diplomatic relations with Central Africa
this year, marked new progress in China's relations with Africa
as a whole.
</P>
<P>
China has always attached great importance to the African
continent and the development of friendly cooperative relations
with Guinea Bissau and all other African countries, Tang
stressed. He expressed the belief that the Sino-Guinea Bissau
relationship would make new and positive progress in the
exchanges and cooperation in various fields and in
people-to-people contact.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 24 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will allow its
companies to give or rent machinery to the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK), Minister for Unification Kang In-duk
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government will abolish the ban of five-million U.S. dollar
investment in the North, Kang told the Korea Federation of
Industries.
</P>
<P>
"We will also allow companies to barter with fertilizer and
contract joint agricultural projects," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kang said the heads of large businesses and leaders of
economic organizations will be allowed to visit the North.
</P>
<P>
The minister's remarks were seen as a reaffirmation of the
government's policy of separating economic cooperation from
political issues with the DPRK although the South-North
vice-ministerial level talks in Beijing failed to reach an
agreement last week over the issue of food and fertilizer
assistance.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were also believed to be an apparent response to
the demand made by Korea Federation of Small Business Chairman
Park Sang-hee and Daewoo Chairman Kim Woo-choong to visit the
North.
</P>
<P>
The government has already allowed Chung Ju-yung, founder of
Hyundai Group, to visit the North.
</P>
<P>
In his inauguration speech in February, South Korean President
Kim Dae-jung said the inter-Korean relations must be based on
reconciliation and cooperation.

two months of this year, an increase of 11.9 percent over the same

<P>
Facing oversupply on domestic markets, firms producing caustic
soda and soda ash explored overseas markets, emerging as a factor
for the export increase, the official said.

NANCHANG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A whole gale and heavy hail hit
two cities in east China's Jiangxi Province late Wednesday evening
and early Thursday morning, killing at least 12 people, injuring
over 1,000 people, and causing heavy property damage.
</P>
<P>
Gale force winds and heavy hail lasting some 30 minutes hit
Pingxiang City at around 18:00 p.m. on Wednesday cutting a 10-15
km wide swath of destruction stretching over 60 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Hailstones as large as 75 mm in diameter covered the ground to
depths of as much as 100 millimeters.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists report that the area last witnessed heavy
hail on the scale in 1957.
</P>
<P>
Local governments report that some 408 houses collapsed,
with an additional 35,000 houses sustaining heavy damage. The
storm also devastated over 13,300 ha of farmland.
</P>
<P>
Estimates indicate that the storm adversely affected the lives
of over 640,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Gale force winds and heavy hail lasting from 21:00 pm on
Wednesday into the early moring hours on Thursday also hit
nine townships in Fengcheng City.
</P>

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman on Diplomatic Ties Restoration between China, Guinea-Bissau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The restoration of diplomatic ties
between China and Guinea Bissau conforms to the common aspiration
and the fundamental interests of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhu Bangzao made the remarks here
today.
</P>
<P>
The Government of the People's Republic of China and the
Government of the Republic of Guinea Bissau have, through friendly
discussions, decided to restore diplomatic relations at the
ambassadorial level as of April 23 this year.
</P>
<P>
"We are gratified with this development." Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu went on to note that both China and Guinea-Bissau are
developing countries and share extensive common ground in a wide
range of fields.
</P>
<P>
"We are sure that the friendly relations and cooperation
between China and Guinea-Bissau will be fully restored and
developed on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence," Zhu added.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, he said, the Taiwan authorities, taking
advantage of some countries' temporary economic difficulties, have
launched a campaign of "pragmatic diplomacy" in Africa and other
parts of the world in an attempt to win over some countries to
"establish or restore diplomatic ties" with them or engage in
"dual recognition".
</P>
<P>
The attempts of such kind by the Taiwan authorities aimed at
splitting the motherland in disregard of the overall national
interests have encountered the firm opposition of the entire
Chinese people, including the Taiwan compatriots, and have been
rejected by an overwhelming majority of the countries in the
world, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Facts have shown that the Taiwan authorities' attempts are
futile and are doomed to failure, and the restoration of the
diplomatic relations between China and Guinea-Bissau is just a
case in point, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> WTO Praises S. Africa's Trade Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade
Organization (WTO) Thursday praised South Africa's overall
progress in liberalizing trade in the past four years, South
African newspapers reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
In its first review of the new state's trade policies,
released Thursday after three days of discussions, the WTO said
the country's structural reforms since its 1994 general election
have laid a "credible foundation" for making South African
products more competitive internationally.
</P>
<P>
However, the world trade policing body warned that South
Africa must stop using its tariffs for "selective protection" and
must simplify its arrangements under the Southern African Customs
Union along with its fellow union members - Botswana, Lesotho,
Namibia and Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
In spite of reforms, South Africa still maintained a system of
duties that "is frequently changed for selective protection", and
the tariff regime of the country as well as the customs union
also remained complex, the WTO said.
</P>
<P>
A revised structure was essential to conform to WTO
obligations, to attract more foreign investment and to ease new
regional agreements, the Geneva-based body said.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the benefits of government trade reforms on
South Africa's competitiveness are being eroded by rising labor
costs.
</P>
<P>
The competitiveness of South African manufacturers, shielded
by tariffs averaging 16 percent, is being hurt by "upward
pressures on unit labor costs resulting partly from a lack of
skilled labor", the WTO said.
</P>
<P>
South African Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin rejected
the criticism of the country's duty system, saying that the
report, completed last year, did not reflect the current
circumstances correctly.
</P>
<P>
He said most of the barriers to trade had been eliminated or
were not effective, and the remaining ones would be removed in
the coming year.
</P>
<P>
Erwin dealt out some criticism of his own, warning that if the
WTO did not improve the institutional capacity of developing
countries to implement WTO rules, it would contribute to "severe
developmental distortions."
</P>
<P>
Erwin in effect said now that developed countries had grown
rich through protectionism, they were denying it to developing
countries when they needed it.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Fiscal Report Optimistic for First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 24 (Xinhua) -- First-quarter revenue in
Shanghai, China's largest financial and commercial center, was 8.4
billion yuan, up 14 percent over the same period last year,
according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The figure accounts for 21.6 percent of the municipality's
annual budget.
</P>
<P>
Taxes from the industrial and commercial sectors were up 13.4
percent compared with the same period last year, with corporate
income taxes of 1.2 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's fiscal expenditures in the first quarter also
climbed 16 percent to 6.48 billion yuan, mainly flowing into
infrastructure construction, corporate funding, civil
construction, science and education.
</P>
<P>
Outstanding bank deposits in the city's financial institutions
during the period amounted to 554.8 billion yuan, for a surplus of
111.4 billion yuan to bank loans.

<P>
Of the total, outstanding saving deposits reached 220.4 billion
yuan, up 7.3 billion yuan from the end of last year, with 5.76
billion yuan of urban savings and 1.5 billion yuan from farmers.
</P>

Financial insiders attributed the healthy fiscal record to a
rational policy toward bank loans.
</P>
<P>
In the securities market, the quarterly turnover was down 24.5
percent to 607.9 billion yuan, with 229.3 billion from stock
transactions, down 28.7 percent compared with the corresponding
period last year.

first three months, representing a drop of 1.8 billion yuan.

The Renminbi is still steady against the U.S. dollar, despite
small fluctuations, as figures indicated in China's Foreign
Exchange Trading Center based in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Total foreign exchange transactions through the center topped
15.9 billion U.S. dollars in the first three months with daily
turnovers averaging 265 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Inter-bank foreign exchange trading during the period suggested
a downturn of 448 million yuan in average daily transaction
volume. Total turnover for the first quarter was 26.9 billion
yuan.

<HEADLINE> No Postponement of Local Elections: Chissano </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano has said that there is no reason to postpone the local
elections scheduled to be held on June 30.
</P>
<P>
A further delay of the elections "means to postpone the
exercise of the people's rights," the Noticias quoted Chissano as
saying Thursday in Monapo, northern Nampula Province.
</P>
<P>
This is the first response Chissano made to the boycott by the
16 opposition parties led by the Mozambican National Resistance
(RENAMO), the biggest opposition.
</P>
<P>
The local elections were initially set to be held in late
1997. But they were put off till May this year and later, the
date was postponed once again to June 30.
</P>
<P>
It may not be a bad thing for the opposition political parties
to withdraw from the elections in late June, Chissano said,
adding that they can make full preparations for the parliamentary
and presidential elections next year.
</P>
<P>
President Chissano Monday started a six-day working tour of
Nampula Province. Monapo is one of the five places the president
is scheduled to visit.
</P>
<P>
Chissano noted that he hopes the local elections next year
will cover the whole country and autonomy can be practised in all
cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an audience of over 3,000 people in Monapo, the
president castigated some state and public units for corrupt
conducts, particularly in the health care sector.
</P>
<P>
He said his government is trying to improve the service of the
state units. For instance, some police officers are receiving
training so that they can better serve the people.

the same period of last year when the value of the approved
projects stood at 179.8 million Zimbabwean Dollars (10 million
U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing accounted for the largest slice with project
approvals in this sector valuing 3.5 billion Zimbabwean Dollars
(205 million U.S. Dollars) compared to 108 million Zimbabwean
Dollars (6.35 million U.S. Dollars) in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Tourism was second with 52.6 million U.S. Dollars and
commercial sector third with 20 million U.S. Dollars followed by
mining with 1.36 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report said that approvals for January 1998 represented
more than 50 percent of all the projects approved in 1997 which
totaled 476 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Of the 25 approved projects launched by mainly companies from
German and United Kingdom, 24 were joint ventures which were

<P>
CANBERRA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Sydney will be scrutinised its
preparations for the 2000 Games by Olympic chief Juan Antonio
Samaranch on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The IOC Executive Board will meet from April 27 to 30 alongside
a high-ranking delegation from the Association of Summer Olympic
International Federations (ASOIF).
</P>
<P>
They will check on Olympic facilities, such as transport,
venues, staffing, technology and accommodation before delivering a
report.
</P>
<P>
Also high on the agenda will be politics, which has dominated
preparations and blew up Thursday when Prime Minister John Howard
refused to have any further dealings with New South Wales Olympics
Minister Michael Knight.
</P>
<P>
Another big issue is drugs in sport and the anti-doping
technology used to combat it.
</P>
<P>
IOC member Kevan Gosper last week virtually ruled out
blood-tests, saying it had yet to be proved that it added to the
accuracy of urine-testing.
</P>
<P>
With more than 80 local and international journalists tracking
his every move, the Barcelona-born Samaranch only gave his press
conference on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It is the 77-year-old IOC president's second visit to the city
since it was chosen to host the Games five years ago.

<HEADLINE> Police Station Opened at HK's New Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's latest and most
modern police station was opened at the new Chek Lap Kok Airport
Friday.
</P>
<P>
With sophisticated equipment, the station is expected to
perform the same duties as at the Kai Tak airport, both in
preventing and detecting crime and maintaining public order, but
in a much larger airport.
</P>
<P>
Officiating at the opening ceremony of the police station,
Commissioner of Police Hui Ki-on said, "Incorporated within the
station is probably the world's most advanced Police Incident
Command Center, which will be used in the event of a major
incident at the airport."
</P>
<P>
"However, I sincerely hope that this facility is never used in
earnest," Hui said.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the duties of the officers at the new airport which
is to start operation on July 6, he said uniformed officers will
conduct patrols of the spacious passenger terminal building and
surrounding areas, including the whole of the airport island, and
crime officers investigate criminal offenses.
</P>
<P>
The Airport Security Unit, which has been considerably expanded
compared with the unit at Kai Tak, will also be based at the new
airport. There will also be specially trained dogs to detect
explosives.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the station began in October 1995 and was
completed in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
During a press visit to the new station Thursday, Keith
Braithwaite, regional commander of "New Territories" South, said
that by mid-June, the station will be fully manned by more than
330 officers. Presently there are some 80 police officers.
</P>
<P>
Braithwaite expected that with the opening of the new airport,
baggage theft and shop theft would become common types of
offenses.

SINGAPORE, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Share prices declined
marginally on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times
Industrials Index (STII) fell by 4.58 points to close at 1491.28

dollars). Declines led advances by 188 to 87 while the other 321
counters remained unchanged.

The Singapore Telecom was the most actively traded stock as it
registered a turnover of 8.75 million units. It was followed by
Easyknit which had 6.39 million shares traded. ST (Singapore
Technology) Capital Right was next with 5.44 million units changed
hands.
</P>

Singapore dollars and 4.76 U.S. dollars respectively. F&AMP;N was up

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales in Hong Kong Decrease in Early 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The value of total retail sales
in Hong Kong for February this year was an estimated 14.7 billion
HK dollars (1.88 billion U.S. dollars), 18 percent less than a
year earlier, according to provisional figures released here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
After discounting the effect of price changes over the period,
total retail sales decreased by 19 percent in volume, the Census
and Statistics Department figures showed.
</P>
<P>
Affected by the timing of the Chinese Lunar New Year, retail
sales tend to show more volatility in the first two months of a
year. The Lunar New Year fell on late January this year but in
early February last year. It is therefore more significant to
compare the retail sales figures for January and February
combined.
</P>
<P>
Taking the first two months of 1998 together, total retail
sales declined by 14 percent in value or 15 percent in volume over
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
On a year-on-year comparison, sales in department stores
recorded the largest drop, by 26 percent in value and 28 percent
in volume in the first two months of the year.
</P>
<P>
This was followed by sales of motor vehicles; clothing and
footwear; jewelry, watches and clocks and valuable gifts; and
miscellaneous consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
Sales of food, alcoholic drinks, tobacco and fuels fell more
moderately in the two months, all within 6 percent in both value
and volume.
</P>
<P>
A government secretariat spokesman commented that the setback
in the retail business in early 1998 was due mainly to the
repercussions of the regional financial turmoil on the local
economy.
</P>
<P>
While tourist spending plunged along with the protracted
weakness in inbound tourism, local consumer spending also
slackened considerably since late 1997.
</P>
<P>
The volume of retail sales is derived from the value of retail
sales after adjusting for price changes.

<HEADLINE> KCR Promotes Public Understanding of West Rail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Kowloon-Canton
Railway Corporation (KCR) Friday staged an exhibition at Tsuen Wan
to promote the citizens' understanding of a railway project
linking the northwestern part of the "New Territories" and
Kowloon.
</P>
<P>
The three-day exhibition focuses on the background and major
characteristics of the West Rail project, which is scheduled to
begin at the end of this year. KCR staff will explain details of
the project to the public.
</P>
<P>
The 30.3-kilometer West Rail is designed to stretch from
Yen Chow Street to Tuen Mun, with nine stations along
this section of railway, from which passengers can change to the
Mass Transit Railway and the Airport Railway.
</P>
<P>
The project will cost 64 billion HK dollars (8.2 billion U.S.
dollars) and the fund will come from the government, commercial
loans and the KCR itself.
</P>
<P>
The northwestern part of the "New Territories" has enjoyed
rapid growth in the past years. The population in this region is
estimated to grow from the current 800,000 to 1.4 million by 2003,
when the West Rail is completed.
</P>
<P>
The West Rail will further promote economic development in the
area and the construction of the railway will create 100,000 to
120,000 jobs.

<HEADLINE> HK Issues Codes of Practice Against Discrimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region published on Friday two codes of
practice to address discrimination in the workplace on the grounds
of race and sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
A Home Affairs Bureau spokesman said the codes, known as the
Codes of Practice Against Discrimination in Employment on the
Grounds of Race and Sexual Orientation, aim to encourage employers
and employees to eliminate discriminatory practices in the
workplace through self-regulation.
</P>
<P>
"The codes seek to promote equal employment opportunities among
people of different races and sexual orientations. They reaffirm
the government's commitment to the elimination of all forms of
discrimination," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The codes recommend that, among other things, employers develop
consistent and objective selection criteria in all aspects of
employment, including recruitment, appraisal, promotion, posting,
training, dismissal and redundancy, terms and conditions of
employment benefits, facilities and services.
</P>
<P>
Employers are also encouraged to issue a clear policy statement
that discrimination, harassment and vilification at work will not
be tolerated under any circumstances and to review the policy from
time to time.
</P>
<P>
Employees, for their part, are urged to acquaint themselves
with the recommendations in the codes, help their employers in
introducing and implementing relevant policies and support friends
or colleagues who have lodged -- or intend to lodge -- complaints
about discrimination.
</P>
<P>
To help drive the message home, the government has published a
new leaflet entitled "Equal Opportunities: Race" and re-designed
the leaflet "Equal Opportunities: Sexual Orientation" in a more
lively format. The leaflets set out the government's position on
equal opportunities in these areas and explain the principles
underlying that position.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
held talks Friday with visiting Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
on the Mideast peace process, the Syrian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The news agency did not disclose details of the talks in the
Mediterranean resort Latakia, to where Mubarak flew earlier in the
day.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's visit is part of the two countries' efforts to
continue consultation and coordination over issues in the Middle
East, particularly the Israeli offer to carry out a conditional
withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad visited Egypt on April 15 to discuss with Mubarak the
response of Syria and Lebanon to the Israeli offer. Mubarak
expressed Egypt's support for the Syrian and Lebanese position.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak is to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on Tuesday, only days before the proposed London
meetings on reviving the peace process will be held. The subject
was apparently included in the talks between Mubarak and al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
Israel decided on April 1 to accept the United Nations Security
Council Resolution 425 and to withdraw from south Lebanon provided
security arrangements are worked out with Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Lebanon, which agree to coordinate their stances on
key issues, including peace-making with Israel, have rejected
Israel's offer, insisting that the withdrawal should be
unconditional.
</P>
<P>
Israel is occupying a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in
south Lebanon with the claimed aim to protect its northern areas
from cross-border attacks by Muslim guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> Kidnapped ICRC Workers Released in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The ten kidnapped aid workers
of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) were
officially released by their captors Friday.
</P>
<P>
The hostages were first moved from their place of captivity to
the ICRC run hospital of Keysaney, about a mile north of the
capital, where they were offered a little medical checkup and
refreshment drinks and food.
</P>
<P>
They were also given telephones to contact their offices and
relatives and a plane has been called for to lift them to
Nairobi. The aid workers who all looked healthy but tired were
extremely happy after nine days of captivity.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi Mohamed, a major faction leader in the capital
Mogadishu, spoke with the ICRC staff at the Keysaney Hospital
immediately after their release and gave his apology on behalf of
the Somalis.
</P>
<P>
"This has been an isolated incident and it is not representing
the Somalis in general," he said, adding "the abduction has been
carried out by irresponsible people."
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi also asked ICRC not be discouraged by what had
happened and continue their noble task in helping the poor and
needy Somalis according to the tradition of the ICRC.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi told Xinhua that no ransom has been paid to free the
ICRC hostages, but added that traditional channels had been used
to release them.
</P>
<P>
However, sources close to the militiamen and the negotiators
indicate that 60,000 US Dollars had been given to the abductors
last night while another 40,000 US Dollars was given to them
Friday morning. Moreover, this money is reported to have come as
contribution offered by the local Somalis.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi's deputy chairman, Ali Ugas Abdulle and the
Secretary General of the Somali Red Crescent Society, Nur Addeh,
were also present at Keysaney Hospital where an airplane is
expected to take the ICRC staff members to Nairobi in an hour
from the press time.
</P>
<P>
The abduction of the aid workers stood in the way of the
establishment of Mogadishu's administration and all of the
general reconciliation process of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
However, Ali Mahdi Mohamed said Friday after the ICRC hostages
were released that from Friday on they are to restart their
business of establishing an all inclusive administration for
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC staff had been abducted by armed Somalis with four
technicals on 15 April at Issaley Airstrip controlled by Ali
Mahdi. Earlier, the abductors had demanded about one million US
Dollars, but the negotiators had resisted firmly all kinds of
such bizarre ransom demands.

<HEADLINE> Chronology of Recent Russian Government Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Following is a brief chronology of
Russia's recent government crisis starting from President Boris
Yeltsin sacking of Viktor Chernomyrdin's cabinet in March.
</P>
<P>
March 23
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin dismisses Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and the
entire cabinet, and then names Energy Minister Sergei Kiriyenko,
35, as first deputy prime minister and acting prime minister.
</P>
<P>
March 27
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin nominates Kiriyenko as prime minister, and warns the
State Duma, or the lower house of parliament, that he will
dissolve the legislative chamber and call a new parliamentary
election if it does not approve the nomination.
</P>
<P>
April 2
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin meets parliamentary speakers and allows the 450-seat
Duma to postpone debates to April 10.
</P>
<P>
April 10
</P>
<P>
Duma deputies vote 186-143 to reject Kiriyenko's candidacy in
the first round of balloting. Yeltsin immediately resubmits
Kiriyenko as candidate.
</P>
<P>
April 14
</P>
<P>
Gennady Seleznyov, speaker of Duma, urges co-legislators to
vote for Kiriyenko rather than face an early parliament election.
</P>
<P>
April 17
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko fails the second round of voting at Duma, with 115
votes for and 271 votes against. Again, Yeltsin resubmits
Kiriyenko as candidate.
</P>
<P>
April 18
</P>
<P>
Acting First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov makes it clear
that if the Duma turns down Kiriyenko, Yeltsin will install him as
the prime minister by decree.
</P>
<P>
April 22
</P>
<P>
Russia's Federation Council, or the upper house of parliament,
urges the Duma to vote for the confirmation of Kiriyenko.
</P>
<P>
April 24
</P>
<P>
Duma approved Kiriyenko as prime minister in the third round of
ballot.

<P>
NAIROBI, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Somali gunmen unconditionally
released 10 Red Cross workers Friday morning, the regional office
of the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The workers, who were abducted by nearly 40 armed militiamen
in a small airstrip nearby northern Mogadishu on April 15, will
arrive at Nairobi by air later Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"All the workers are in good health," according to the ICRC office.
</P>
<P>
Among the hostages are a South African pilot, an American, a
French, a Norwegian, a Belgian, two Swiss doctors, a German and a
Somali from the Somali Red Crescent Society.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers are said loyal to a renegade member of northern
Mogadishu's military leader Ali Mahdi's Hawiye clan.
</P>
<P>
Since the abduction happened, the Somali capital saw the
withdrawal of all relief agencies and expatriate staff citing
insecurity. About 45 percent of the city's population is
dependent on relief services.

GUANGZHOU, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The 83rd China Export Commodity
Trade Fair has recorded increased contracts for exports of
domestic brand name products, according to Zhou Jie, a member of
the organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
Brand name products accounted for a substantial portion of
close to five billion US dollars in orders from overseas
businessmen. Brand name electronics products account for some 80 of
export contracts consummated by the Beijing delegation.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that machinery and electronics goods
have led China's exports for three successive three years.
</P>
<P>
"The remarkable growth in exports of brand name products has
contributed to the popularity of related products," according to
Gao Mingdou, deputy-secretary general of the China Chamber of
Machinery and Electronics Exporters.
</P>
<P>
He said that brand names account for some 47.3 percent of
machinery and electronics products ordered during this year's fair.
</P>
<P>
Various brand name garments have also sold well and at higher
prices when compared with previous fairs.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts note that government efforts to encourage local
companies to produce more brand name goods have proved highly
beneficial and have helped improve the reputation of domestic
products on the international market.

<HEADLINE> Rumbling over Foreign Labor Heats in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The arrest of a Thai worker
suspected of raping and killing a Jewish girl has set off a
rumbling of disquiet in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs has been suggested by
kibbutz (collective farm) residents that regulations be amended to
impose a limit to the number of foreign workers in the country and
closer supervision on them, according to The Jerusalem Post Friday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police announced early this week that DNA tests
performed on the 29-year-old Thai worker Korbua Sumbat supported
their suspicion that he has raped and murdered a 23-year-old girl
from the Naan Kibbutz in northern Israel on April 10.
</P>
<P>
Sumbat, who was remanded by a court on Wednesday for another 12
days, came to Naan two months ago. He worked in avocado fields and
citrus orchards.
</P>
<P>
After Sumbat's arrest, Israeli Labor and Social Affairs
Minister Eli Ishai said that foreign workers are having a "deadly
effect" on the Israeli society.
</P>
<P>
Yossi Mizrahi, head of the kibbutz communities, said concern
has been raised within local residents about the safety and
welfare due to inflow of foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing against the workers themselves, but they are
cooped up in one small village with no outlet for their natural
needs and desires," he said.
</P>
<P>
"They are very nice individually, but one of their tendency is
to drink and sometimes get drunk. If this should happen, they are
no longer in control of themselves and this is dangerous," he
added.
</P>
<P>
There are about 200,000 foreign workers in Israel, most of
them came from Romania, Thailand and the Philippines. In some
villages, foreign workers account for about 10 percent of the
population.
</P>
<P>
Foreign workers have become the backbone of the labor force in
Israel's agriculture in the past decade.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Former Philippine Movie Star Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The May 11 presidential elections
in the Philippines may virtually turn into a one-man show of
ex-movie star turned Vice President Joseph Estrada who remains a
clear favorite of the electorate in two opinion polls conducted
this month.
</P>
<P>
In the April 8-19 poll by the Social Weather Station (SWS), the
country's most trusted pollster, Estrada of the opposition LAMMP
(Filipino acronym for the Fight of Patriotic Filipino Masses
Party) gained a 30-percent support rating, more than double that
of his closest rivals.
</P>
<P>
Poll results issued Thursday also showed that if the election
held today, none of the other 10 candidates could pose a threat to
Estrada, who has topped all the three previous monthly SWS surveys
with a hefty 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
The poll found a virtual three-way tie among former Manila
mayor Alfredo Lim, businessman Emilio Osmena, with 13 percent
each, and Speaker of the House of Representatives Jose de Venecia
with 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
Estrada's wide lead was underlined by another poll survey
conducted by the independent Philippine Survey and Research
Center. The poll gave Estrada a whopping 34 percent approval,
against 16 percent for his nearest rival Senator Raul Rocco of the
Democratic Action Party.
</P>
<P>
The surging popularity of Estrada in the final stage of the
90-day campaign period was a surprise to many poll pundits who
have predicted an effective three-cornered fight among Estrada,
Lim and De Venecia.
</P>
<P>
It had been expected that De Venecia's rating could continue to
rise given the strong support of President Fidel Ramos and the
ruling Lakas-NUCD Party's powerful political machine.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia, who had been among the tail-enders in many previous
polls, managed to surge to the second place in the March SWS poll
with 14 percent in a tie with Lim, who was backed by former
president Corazon Aquino.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the surveys indicated both Lim and De
Venecia have reached a plateau while the highly popular Estrada
continues to gain strength from the middle-lower classes of the
voters despite repeated mudslingings from his rivals.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Former Philippine Movie Star Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Estrada, who made a household name in the 1960s for playing
Robin Hood heroes fighting for the poor, has been a repeated
target of mudslingings and black propaganda from his rivals since
January.
</P>
<P>
The ex-movie star, who turned 61 last week, has long been
accused by his critics of having a series of "sins," which include
heavy drinking, womanizing and gambling.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the influential Roman Catholic Church have also
suggested that the portly and mustache ex-movie star is not
morally fit to govern.
</P>
<P>
Estrada admitted having adulterous affairs, but said those were
"sins" of the past when he was a movie star. He denied having
drinking and gambling problems.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, a college dropout, is also disliked by big business
groups who question his grasp of economic issues especially at a
time when the country's economy has slowed down in the wake of an
Asian financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Estrada himself admitted he is an ignoramus in economics. He
said if elected, he will leave economic affairs to his running
mate Senator Angara Edgardo, a lawyer and a recognized economist.
</P>
<P>
But Estrada said it is unnecessary for the business community
to be afraid of an economic slump under an Erap (his nickname)
presidency since "the economy has already slowed down due to the
Asian financial crisis."
</P>
<P>
To ease the resistance from the business circle and foreign
investors, Estrada, who runs on a populist pro-poor platform,
promised to continue Ramos' economic reforms which have turned the
country into "an emerging tiger."
</P>
<P>
There were even more serious charges against him in the past
two months, which include his secret plot to murder Ramos and his
involvement in a pyramid scam.
</P>
<P>
But it seemed that all these attacks made no dent on Erap's
high popularity among the middle-lower classes who have seen him
as their hero and savior.
</P>
<P>
Columnist Emil Jurado said: "Instead of the demolition job on
Erap eroding his popularity among the masa (Filipino form for
mass), it has endeared him more to them."
</P>
<P>
"It's the typical Filipino psyche which tends to side with the
underdog. And since Erap is their idol, he has become both their
hero and the underdog," he explained.
</P>
<P>
"The Erap phenomenon goes beyond the fact that Erap, the 'hero'
whom the masses identify with, has gained more sympathy with all
his detractors and political enemies throwing everything in his
direction."
</P>
<P>
The latest poll results were hailed by Erap's camp, which
claimed that the May 11 presidential poll was already in Estrada's
bag.
</P>
<P>
But Ramos, who won the 1992 elections with a narrow margin as
indicated by most pre-election SWS polls, laughed off the claim.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, who is barred by the constitution from seeking
re-election, said that Estrada's emergence as consistent top
notcher in the presidential surveys did not guarantee he would
emerge victorious.
</P>
<P>
Lakas national campaign manager Cesar Sarino also debunked the
surveys, saying the ruling party's strong political machine will
finally lead De Venecia to victory in the May 11 ballot.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts, however, predicts that Erap will continue to be
a front runner till the May 11 showdown as a result of the
bandwagon effect caused by the poll surveys.
</P>
<P>
"From hereon, we will see some mayors, governors and
congressmen and leaders of other political parties gravitating
towards him," said Jurado. "It has always been so since no
politician wants to be identified with the loser."
</P>
<P>
Likewise, a regrouping of campaign financiers is also expected.
Some campaign contributors is seen to give up low-ranking
candidates and swing their support to Estrada for better
investment, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Alarmed by the soaring popularity of Estrada, Manila Archbishop
Jaime Cardinal Sin, the country's leading prelate, urged Thursday
Estrada's trailers to make a sacrifice by merging forces to stop
the controversial Estrada from winning.
</P>
<P>
"The most probable winner could be the most probably disastrous
for the country," said the influential Catholic Church leader in a
pastoral statement. But he himself admitted earlier that Estrada
is unbeatable. "If there is no cheating, he is going to win," Sin
said.

<HEADLINE> Accredited Checking Officers Preparing to Do Their Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A group of 100 people will get a
two-month training course starting next week to give them
accreditation as checking officers for various big state-owned
enterprises, the Personnel Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
"We are now preparing to send them to their job positions as
early as possible," said Song Defu, the Personnel Minister.
</P>
<P>
According to Song, sending accredited checking officers to
big state-owned enterprises is an important part of the current
financial, assessment and employment reforms in them.
</P>
<P>
"They are appointed by the State Council and will not intervene
in the enterprises' operations. Their main task is supervision
and checking accounting," Song said. Their reports will be used in
cadre evaluations to ensure that enterprises are managed by the
right people.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Philippines Retrieves Part of Marcos' Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was reported that the rest 240 million dollars would soon be
returned to the Philippines. But how to divide or use the money
has aroused harsh controversies.
</P>
<P>
The Marcos family said that according to a secret deal it
signed with the Fidel Ramos administration, the government had 75
percent of the money and the family had 25 percent. The government
denied the deal while the human rights victims of the Marcos
regime said they should be given top priority to have about 100
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Right at this time, Imelda, who was on parole and campaigning
to run for the presidency in the coming May 11 elections, said the
family had at least 800 million dollars more and she would scatter
the wealth to the poor if she wins the presidency.
</P>
<P>
"There is more Marcos wealth that this government is not yet
aware of, but for the time being I can admit that there is only
800 million dollars kept in various international banks, but I can
not reveal them," she said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that Imelda has publicly admitted her
family had more than what the government has discovered. Although
analysts said Imelda's statement has political colors, the
government decided to widen the search for Marcos' wealth.
</P>
<P>
But How much money did the Marcos family have? Where did they
put it? When can the government retrieve all the money? Nobody can
answer these questions. Analysts believed that it is no easy job
for the Philippine government to recover the Marcos wealth.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Philippines Retrieves Part of Marcos' Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- After 12 years of legal battles,
the Philippines recently recovered for the first time about 300
million U.S. dollars of the late President Ferdinand Marcos'
wealth.
</P>
<P>
Magtanggol Gunigundo, Chairman of the Presidential Commission
on Good Government, said the money has been transferred to the
country from Swiss banks and deposited on an escrow account of the
Philippine National Bank.
</P>
<P>
The money was part of the 540 million dollars the Swiss Supreme
Court ordered to be returned to the country. The Philippine
government said the wealth was "looted" from state treasury by
Marcos during his 20 years' ruling of the country.
</P>
<P>
Marcos was toppled in 1986 in a popular revolt and died in
Hawaii, the United States three years later. After he fled the
country, the then new president, Corazon Aquino, immediately began
the work to retrieve his ill-gotten wealth.
</P>
<P>
However, because of political turmoils, natural disasters and
the "self defense" of the Marcos family, the Aquino administration
made little progress in recovering the wealth.
</P>
<P>
Although the Swiss Supreme Court ruled twice during the past
few years that the money should be transferred to the Philippines,
it was until the end of last year that Manila saw the hope of
solving the problem.
</P>
<P>
Last December, the court ruled again that two Swiss banks
should return to the Philippines 100 million dollars of Marcos'
wealth which has grown to 540 million dollars due to accrued
interest.
</P>
<P>
The court extended the amount to the whole 540 million dollars
in January this year, but the prerequisite was that Imelda, the
former First Lady and inheritor of the Marcos wealth, must be
proven guilty in a fair and final trial.
</P>
<P>
During the past 12 years, Gunigundo's commission and victims
under the Marcos regime lodged at least 36 charges against Imelda.
But due to lack of evidence, all the charges except one had been
dismissed by the courts.
</P>
<P>
In February this year, the third division of the Philippine
Supreme Court announced that it upheld a local court's ruling in
1993 that sentenced Imelda to 9 to 12 years in imprisonment for a
land deal, in which she allegedly profiteered by renting a piece
of government land at very low prices and leasing it out at high
prices.
</P>
<P>
Imelda appealed to the court, but was rejected. Her supporters
in Panama and Liechtenstein appealed to the Swiss court to repeal
the ruling, but also failed. So all blocks to the transfer of the
wealth had been cleared.

JOHANNESBURG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- South African president
Nelson Mandela Friday raised the possibility of imposing a curfew
in certain areas of the Western Cape Province to fight rampant
crime and gang violence there.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with the inter-religious commission on crime
and violence in the Western Cape, Mandela said the group proposed
curfew and other measures to deal with the ever escalating crime
in the province, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
One of the suggestions was to have some courts open 24 hours a
day to deal instantly with urgent cases, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela pledged to convey the ideas to the relevant ministers
for their consideration.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, he briefed the commission on steps being
taken by the security forces to deal with the situation.
</P>
<P>
He said he was convinced that the police were winning the war
against crime, but it was a difficult situation and one could not
expect miracles overnight.
</P>
<P>
The commission also discussed ways of bringing "healing" to
the broken communities in the province.

<HEADLINE> China Bank Increases Support for Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China (BOC), the
country's major foreign exchange bank, will increase its loans to
Chinese enterprises that conduct foreign trade on their own, a
bank official said.
</P>
<P>
The bank's lending to such enterprises has been budgeted at 10
billion yuan, up two billion yuan from last year, a bank official
said, adding that financial support for specialized foreign trade
companies will also increase.
</P>
<P>
The move is intended to boost China's foreign trade and thereby
to ensure the successful realization of the nation's eight percent
economic growth plan this year, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
China's export growth has slowed down partly due to the
persisting Asian financial crisis, which has resulted in massive
currency devaluations in Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, the
Republic of Korea, among other countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Figures of the State Statistics Bureau released today indicate
that China's exports totaled 40.2 billion US dollars in the first
three months of this year, up 13.2 percent from the same period of
last year. The growth rate is significantly down from the 20.9
percent rise for the whole of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Figures also show that China's first quarter exports to other
Asian countries and regions was up merely 4.8 percent, with
exports to ASEAN member countries down 17.6 percent. Exports to
Japan edged down 1.7 percent while those to the Republic of Korea
dropped by 22.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The BOC official said that bank loans will be used to help
Chinese enterprises to tap the international market.
</P>
<P>
BOC had extended foreign trade-related loans to more than
3,000 enterprises by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
China has planned its foreign trade volume this year at 345
billion US dollar.

<HEADLINE> Positive Changes Seen in UNCHR Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- More dialogue and cooperation and
less confrontation are the positive changes at the 54th session of
the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR), said head
of the Chinese delegation Wu Jianmin here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, he said, among them the most striking is
that no anti-China resolution by the U.S. and its Western partners
surfaced.
</P>
<P>
Besides, a draft by the U.S. aimed at renewing the resolution
to probe Cuba's human rights situation was also turned down, he
said.
</P>
<P>
This demonstrates that to use human rights to provoke
confrontation and interfere in others' internal affairs has become
more and more unpopular.
</P>
<P>
However, the session was not totally free of confrontation
still adopting 13 country-by-country resolutions against the
developing nations.
</P>
<P>
"Confrontation is a dead end," Wu stressed, and the right way
to promote and protect human rights is dialogue and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Under continuous calls for years by the developing countries,
Wu said, the current session has given relatively more emphasis to
the economic, social and cultural rights as compared to the
previous ones.
</P>
<P>
Wu hoped that the spirit shown this time will be observed and
pledged that the Chinese delegation is willing to do its best to
put an end to the confrontation existing in the commission.

<HEADLINE> Air Quality Report for China's Major Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua will release weekly air
quality reports on major Chinese cities from the China Environment
Monitoring Center, starting today.
</P>
<P>
It gives the air quality atmospheric pollution index (API) of
sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (NOX), and total suspended
particles (TSP).
</P>
<P>
The air quality has five levels according to the State
Environmental Protection Administration. An API from 0 to 50 is
level I, meaning excellent air quality; 51 to 100 is level II, or
good quality; 101 to 200 is level III, or slight pollution; 201 to
300 is level IV, or medium pollution; and above 300 is level V, or
heavy pollution.
</P>
<P>
This week's report says that, from April 17 to 23, some cities
were seriously polluted by dust from northwestern dust storms.
</P>
<P>
The API of Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Beijing was above 300 and the
biggest problem was TSP.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen, Hefei, Kunming, Nanning, Nanchang, Dalian, Zhuhai,
and Xiamen had good air quality, with an API level 2. Beihai in
the south had excellent air quality, with an API of 47.

<HEADLINE> Platini Forecasts Potential Winners in World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Michel Platini, president of French
1998 World Cup Organizing Committee, said Brazil is the best squad
technically that boast of players with skills.
</P>
<P>
However, the best technical team was not a sure bet to win the
32-member World Cup as rivals with potentials can quene up for a
long line, said the former European top scorer.
</P>
<P>
While Brazil has a better chance of winning the title, Germany,
Italy and England are also capable of making miracles, and France,
Spain, Yugoslavia and even Nigeria have the hope of winning the
World Cup, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the previous 15 World Cups, the titles were swept by six
national teams in which only Uruguay is surely without any slim
hope of taking the title in France, said Platini.
</P>
<P>
Despite its last title dated back to 32 years ago, England can
still cherish its hope, while Germany has been consistent as a
strong candidate in the World Cup history, he said.
</P>
<P>
To forecast the prospect for France, Platini said "France can
win" the World Cup on its home turf.
</P>
<P>
Platini further said that the most favored player, in the fans'
view, usually fails to become a super star in the soccer's biggest
gala and that has been justified in the 68-year history of the
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Many talent footballers did not take the limelight of the World
Cup, "and even myself was usually plagued into injuries prior to
the final stages, including the 1982 finals," said Platini.

<HEADLINE> Korda's No.1 Dream Fails in Monte Carlo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Petr Korda of Czech Republic failed
on his fourth attempt in ten weeks to take over the world number
one ranking as he failed to enter the semifinals of the Monte
Carlo Open in Monaco on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands, former Wimbledon champion,
snapped Korda's dream with a 4-6, 7-6 (7/1), 6-1 quarter-final
victory in the 2.2 million U.S. dollars clay court tournament.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old Korda previously had chances to grab the top
spot over the past two months at Antwerp in February and Indian
Wells and Lipton in the United States last month.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the Czech failed every time to win the match he needed to
take over the number one place.
</P>
<P>
Korda's defeat means that Pete Sampras, trounced 6-1, 6-1 on
Thursday by Frenchman Fabrice Santoro in the third round, will get
back the top spot when the next rankings are released on Monday.

Boris Becker, a three-time finalist who has never won a clay

<P>
NANJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Police in the city of Zhenjiang
in Jiangsu Province recently uncovered a large ring of people
selling pornographic and pirated audiovisual products and
confiscated 21,000 pirated VCDs and 20,000 pirated videotapes.
</P>
<P>
Of the items, 14,300 were pornographic VCDs and 4,900 were
pornographic videotapes. Some 200 people were involved in the
case, said the police.
</P>
<P>
The police tracked down 57 persons who were suspected of
illegal dealings and broke up 5 gangs and 32 storage places.
</P>
<P>
They estimate that 80 percent of the pornographic and pirated
VCDs and videotapes in the local market are shipped from coastal
areas in the south via Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary investigation found that a man named Li Jun, from
Nanjing, ordered 100,000 pirated VCDs and 40,000 pirated
videotapes from Guangzhou in a two-month period last year, then
shipped them to Nanjing to sell.

<HEADLINE> 24th FAO Regional Conference Ends in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The five-day 24th Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) Regional Conference for Asia and
the Pacific wound up here Friday with adoption of a report calling
for concerted efforts by all countries in the region to implement
the World Food Summit Plan of Action.
</P>
<P>
The report also called on countries in the region to be
resolute in sustaining resource allocations for agriculture and
food security in face of the constraints that the recent economic
crisis had imposed on some countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
The conference expressed concern over the EI Nino phenomenon
and other natural disasters, and requested the FAO to support
these countries in their preparedness to deal with natural
disasters and assist them by strengthening national and regional
early warning systems within the framework of the Global
Information and Early Warning System.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the fact that about 85 percent of the world's
fishers live in Asia and the Pacific which contribute more than
half of the world's fishery production, the conference agreed that
urgent action is needed to promote fisheries and to accelerate
development of sustainable aquaculture.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, Jacques Diouf, Director-General of the FAO,
called for regional and sub-regional cooperation in drawing up
effective framework in support of the sustainable development of
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The conference agreed that the next FAO Regional Conference for
Asia and the Pacific will be held in Tokyo, Japan, in the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which began on Monday with a three-day senior
officials meeting and a two-day ministerial meeting, is the first
regional gathering of agricultural ministers since the 1996 World
Food Summit held in Rome, Italy.
</P>
<P>
Attending the conference were about 150 representatives from
26 FAO member countries in Asia and the Pacific, U.N. agencies
and non-governmental organizations. A nine-member Chinese
delegation led by Vice Minister of Agriculture Wan Baorui also
attended the conference.

<HEADLINE> OAU Members Urged to Cooperate in Nuclear Science </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) Friday called on member states to enhance cooperation
in application of nuclear science and technology for African
development.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Daniel Antonio, acting secretary general
of OAU at the opening session of the second OAU seminar on
nuclear science and technology at the OAU secretariat here.
</P>
<P>
Antonio said the African regional cooperative agreement for
research, development and training related to nuclear science and
technology (AFRA) is one of the very successful models in
embodying such cooperation among African countries.
</P>
<P>
Now, he pointed out that one of the main goals and objectives
of the seminar is to increase awareness and to inform OAU member
states who are not members of the agency, about the importance of
the issues of radiation safety and waste management at their
respective countries.
</P>
<P>
He announced that the OAU has allocated a fund in its budget
for 1998/99, for convening the third seminar and asked any
interested member states, who wishes to host the forthcoming
seminar, to contact the secretariat in this regard.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Qian Jihui, deputy director general of the
International Atomic Energy Agency said since April 1990, when
the AFRA entered into force, 23 African countries have become
members and there are now 13 cooperative projects dealing with
several areas that are of priority.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the partners in development, which include
the agency and the OAU, have faith in AFRA's ability to guide
the efforts of this region to build upon the existing
capabilities in nuclear science and technology as well as taking
on the challenges of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
On the two main issues of the seminar, radiation safety and
waste management, Qian said the agency welcomes the initiative
taken by the secretariat of the OAU to address these issues,
adding that "We are also fully supportive of the proposed action
plan which aims at making use of the influence of the OAU and of
AFRA to accelerate the promulgation and enforcement of national
legislation on radiation protection and to improve the technical
infrastructure."
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar elected Egypt and the Democratic Republic
of Congo as chairman and vice-chairman respectively.
</P>
<P>
The first seminar was held at Kampala, Uganda in April, 1990
on the theme of "Africa's role in nuclear science for peace and
development."

<HEADLINE> Canada Helping China Get Funds For Water Resources Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government is
working with China's Water Resources Ministry to find ways to
improve its ways of getting foreign investment for water resources
and hydro-electric power projects.
</P>
<P>
The Canada International Development Agency (CIDA) has offered
the ministry 200,000 Canadian dollars and sent some specialists to
help study China's current policy on foreign investment in the
sector, according to Yuan Tanlin, of the Ministry's Foreign
Investment Management Office.
</P>
<P>
Yuan told Xinhua today that China's foreign investment policies
in water resources have failed to catch up with market changes,
one reason that overseas investors are not interested in water
resources development in China.
</P>
<P>
China had 480 million US dollars worth of foreign investment in
water resources development during the 1992-1996 period, only
about 0.3 percent of China's total foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Yuan said China needs to take Canadian know-how into serious
consideration.
</P>
<P>
CIDA uses Canada China Power Inc. (CCPI), which consists of
three of Canada's foremost engineering consulting firms in the
power sector, to do consulting. It has been involved in most of
the major water resources and hydroelectric projects in China that
have required foreign technical assistance, like the Three Gorges,
Xiaolangdi, and Wanjiazhai projects

</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>

<HEADLINE> Xiao Yang: Open-door Policy Needed for Rectification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Xiao Yang, President of the
Supreme People's Court, said today that the court will
adopt an open-door policy to solicit opinions from various
peoples in its rectification.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came a day after the Central Political Science and
Law Committee's decision to begin an education and rectification
campaign for the people working in judicial and public security
departments.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme People's Court is the country's highest judicial
department and should represent the greatest degree of uprightness
and freedom from corruption, Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
The rectification campaign must begin with leading officials,
Xiao said, and if they fail to set a good example, or even break
the law, the damage to the society will be all that much greater.
</P>
<P>
He said that the criteria for the success of the rectification
is whether there is a turn for the better in court's work and in
judicial employees' attitude towards the people.
</P>
<P>
Departments related should investigate irregularities that
emerge in the rectification process like taking bribes or bending
the law and deal with them in a resolute way, Xiao said.

<HEADLINE> IMF-imposed Interest Rates on South Korea Need to Be Lowered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The high interest rates imposed by
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on South Korea need to be
lowered to help improve the nation's debt repayment capability,
Minister for Finance and Economy Lee Kyu-sung said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The negative consequences of the current IMF-imposed tight
monetary policy are becoming more and more apparent, Lee told the
"Meet the New Leadership" conference here.
</P>
<P>
Because of increasing bankruptcies in South Korea, "a reduction
of the interest rates is urgent and should be implemented no later
than May," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since last December, every month has seen some 3,000 South
Korean firms went belly up, according to the Bank of Korea.
</P>
<P>
South Korea signed an agreement with the IMF last December for
a rescue loan of 57 billion U.S. dollars after it was gripped by a
financial crisis triggered by corporate collapses and bad loans of
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that recent stability of the South Korean
currency, won, together with improvements in the current account,
suggest that the domestic interest rate could be lowered without
eroding foreign investor confidence, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Assuming that the IMF will agree to lowering the rates, the
South Korean government could deal with corporate and financial
reforms more decisively and effectively," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the ruin of the South Korean corporate sector
can only undermine the country's debt payment capability.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference started here Thursday and was attended
by some 350 delegates from multinational companies across the
world. At the conference, South Korean President Kim Dae-Jung has
called for more foreign investment to his country.

<HEADLINE> Germany Pledges 34,800 Tons of Food Aid to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The government of the
Federal Republic of Germany has pledged up to 34,800 metric tons
of food aid to Ethiopia during 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Herald, a government newspaper, Friday quoted an
announcement by the German embassy here as saying that 23,300
metric tons of the total package will be delivered in chronically
food deficit areas in Tigrai and Amhara regions and the remaining
11,500 metric tons is to be channeled through the World Food
Program for the "food for work project" under the Ministry of
Agriculture as well as a refugee program.
</P>
<P>
According to the embassy, this year's pledge represents an
increase of nearly 9,000 metric tons over that of 1997 and is a
clear response of the German government to the emergency needs of
Ethiopia in 1998, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission of
Ethiopia has appealed to international donor community for
572,835 metric tons of food aid for 1998, saying that over 4.2
million people in the country need relief food in 1998.

<HEADLINE> China Making Stricter Land Use Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature is
drafting "the world's strictest law" on land use and farmland
protection, an amendment to the Land-Use Law, which is scheduled
for deliberation by the Second Session of the National People's
Congress Standing Committee on April 26.
</P>
<P>
It states that land-use offices need to make maintaining the
country's farmland as their top priority, the director of the
Policy and Law Department of the new Land and Natural Resources
Ministry, Gan Zangchun, who was in charge of the drafting, said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The amendment needs to see to it that farmland increases and
land for construction is controlled, and urban planning should not
come in conflict with the nation's land use plan, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has its first law on land use since 1986, but legal
scholars say that the law is somewhat unsuitable for a market
economy.
</P>
<P>
The draft includes measures for protecting farmland, the
compensation system for farmland, and penalties for violations.
</P>
<P>
The ministry says that China has 130 million hectares of
farmland, an average of 0.1 hectare for each person. The United
Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has set a minimum of per
capita farmland of 0.05 hectare.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural restructuring and disasters in recent years have
destroyed more than 4.7 million hectares of farmland, and
non-agricultural construction claimed another 1.97 million
hectares, so China is in bad need of better land use management.
</P>
<P>
After deliberation by the NPC Standing Committee, the draft
might be shown to the public for suggestion, sources say.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- FIFA General Secretary Sepp
Blatter on Friday acknowledged errors in the World Cup ticketing
system and pledged for a different version in future.
</P>
<P>
"It (the ticketing system) has worked well for three World
Cups...and now the same system did not work well. We cannot repeat
the error so we will change in the future," Blatter said in the
BBC television.
</P>
<P>
Several European countries, with Britain the most vociferous,
protested that they have not been allocated sufficient tickets and
have been angered by France receiving the lion's share.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Britain asked France to improve the efficiency of
a telephone ticket hotline which has frustrated fans across Europe
for two days, with million of calls being made to try to obtain
tickets.
</P>
<P>
Blatter, who is also seeking the presidency of FIFA, said the
new system in future would be adjusted on a one-by-one basis,
especially when many neighbouring countries were taking part in
the competition.
</P>
<P>
"We have repeated the same system since I am working in
FIFA. It worked well for Mexico, for Italy -- there were empty
seats in Italy -- and for the U.S. and now the same system did not
work so well here," he said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Is Hope for Afghan Peace Reborn? (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The war-weary Afghans' hope for
peace seems to be rekindled as Afghanistan's warring factions are
going to enter into negotiations for an early end to the
protracted conflict ravaging their homeland.
</P>
<P>
Five delegates from the Afghan Islamic Taliban militia and nine
from the rival Northern Alliance, who together make up a Joint
Steering Committee, are hopefully to meet here on Saturday under
the auspices of the United Nations and the Organization of Islamic
Conference (OIC).
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Taliban and the Northern Alliance will be
the first face-to-face encounter between the two rivals in more
than a year. The representatives of the two sides had met thrice
here last year but failed to make any progress.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan has over the last one year been practically divided
into two parts, three fourths under the Taliban and the rest under
the Northern Alliance, with each side trying to upset the
situation through use of armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming talks between the mainly ethnic-Pushtoon
militia, and the alliance led by ethnic-Uzbek, Tajik and Hazara
warlords, was made possible after recent hectic diplomatic efforts
made by the U.N., the OIC, Pakistan and other countries who have
strong influence in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Though the two sides have some differences over the agenda of
the talks, Taliban and the alliance have asserted that they would
focus on the formation of Ulema (religious scholar) Commission,
besides other issues like ceasefire and exchange of prisoners.

<P>
The Joint Steering Committee, proposed by Taliban, is yet
another attempt to iron out their differences on the composition
of the Ulema Commission which, if and when formed, will bear the
responsibility for deciding the political set-up in Kabul, the
Afghan capital.
</P>
<P>
The hard-line Taliban had rejected the first Ulema list of the
Northern Alliance last month, claiming that the alliance had
proposed disqualified religious scholars.
</P>
<P>
Head of the U.N. Afghan Mission in Islamabad N. Gobi has said
that the modalities of this new round of talks will be decided on
Friday by the representatives of both sides themselves while the
duration "depends on how the process moves forward."
</P>
<P>
Gobi is to jointly preside over Saturday's intra-Afghan meeting
with Ibrahim Saleh Bakar, OIC Assistant Secretary General, who
just arrived here Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Terming the meeting as an important development for peace and
stability in Afghanistan, Bakar said Friday upon his arrival at
the Islamabad airport that the Muslim world is expecting a
positive outcome of the long-waited talks among the Afghan warring
factions.
</P>
<P>
"It is a good omen that the Afghan leaders have realized the
need of an early end of the prevailing rift among their ranks," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Iftikhar Murshed, Pakistan's special envoy on Afghanistan, also
said Friday that he is hopeful that the process of the
intra-Afghan talks will move forward settling the contentious
issues among the warring factions.
</P>
<P>
However, some political observers here sounded a note of
caution against high expectations from the forthcoming Joint
Steering Committee meeting, which is being held at an extremely
low level.
</P>
<P>
The observers said given the rigid and inflexible position of
the Afghan warlords, it would be unrealistic to expect immediate
results from the proposed peace talks.
</P>
<P>
And the experiences of the last few years have convincingly
demonstrated the futility of the intra-Afghan dialogue without
achieving an agreement among the countries who are supporting
different Afghan warring factions, they said.
</P>
<P>
Nobody is expecting a quick fix in the Afghan peace process,
especially at a time when the traditional Afghan fighting season
is about to begin, the observers said, adding that the real fear
is that both Taliban and the Northern Alliance are just buying
time from the international community to prepare for a summer
offensive.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Experts from South Korea and the
United States on Friday started a two-day workshop here for new
strategies on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
Draft policies will be made and presented to Seoul and
Washington after a review on the DPRK's situation.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is co-sponsored by the Seoul Forum and the New
York-based U.S. Council on Foreign Relations after the
inter-Korean talks in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The talks last week failed to produce specific results due to
South Korea's persistence to link its fertilizer aid to the DPRK
with other political issues, a stance strongly opposed by
Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
Workshop sponsors have been conducting a joint research program
on the Korean issues, named the "Korea Project", since last
November.
</P>
<P>
Proposals to be made by the workshop are expected to have a
significant impact on the Clinton Administration's policies on the
Korean Peninsula, said analysts.
</P>
<P>
Among the more than 30 researchers at the workshop are Morton
Abramowitz, former U.S. assistant secretary of state, James Laney,
former U.S. ambassador in Seoul, Richard Allen, former
U.S. national security adviser, and former South Korean Foreign
Minister Han Sung-joo.

<HEADLINE> China Making Cutting Of Rare Trees And Their Export Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature is
drafting an amendment to the Forestry Law to be submitted to the
Second Session of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress on April 26 on cutting rare trees and exporting them.
</P>
<P>
The revised law provides criminal penalties for illegal
deforestation or the destruction of rare plants, based on the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild
Flora and Fauna.
</P>
<P>
China has been actively involved in the convention activities
and has taken steps to protect wildlife resources since it joined
the group in 1981. Endangered tree exports have to be approved by
the Chinese convention authorities.
</P>
<P>
The revised Criminal Law, which was adopted last year, states
that people with serious violations of the Forestry Law can be
jailed for three to seven years.
</P>
<P>
China has over 10,000 unique species of wild plants, like the
ginkgo and metasequoia, but experts say that many rare plants are
disappearing as the population grows.
</P>
<P>
China adopted its first regulation on protecting wild animals
and plants in 1997.
